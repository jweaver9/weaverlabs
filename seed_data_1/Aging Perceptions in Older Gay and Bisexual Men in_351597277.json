It is important to continue doing research on this topic and disseminatethis information among professionals who work with older lesbian, gay, and bisexualpeople so that they may better understand how they can meet the specific needs ofthis population.Keywordsaging, gay and bisexual men, older adults, sexualityIntroductionDespite the growing acceptance of homosexuality in Western countries, andparticularly in Portugal (Costa & Davies, 2012; Costa, Pereira, & Leal, 2013,2015), the identity, social, and physical development of lesbian, gay, and bisex-ual (LGB) individuals are still restricted by the presence of negative attitudesand the concomitant experience of stigma and discrimination (de Vries, 2015;Rankin, Weber, Blumenfeld, & Frazer, 2010). In Portugal, prejudice remains(Lopes, Oliveira, Nogueira, & Grave, 2017) notwithstanding important signifi-cant social–political and legislative advances including the introduction of anondiscrimination clause on the basis of sexual orientation in the PortugueseConstitution in 2004, the 2010 law allowing same-sex couples to marry, and the2016 law allowing same-sex couples to adopt and joint-adopt children (Pereira &Monteiro, 2016). That is, even as the Portuguese Constitution now providesprotection against (individual) discrimination, specific laws continue to mirrorthe heteronormative discourses of the lawmaker. In particular, the State is offi-cially neutral, but society is still culturally influenced by Catholic traditions(Oliveira, Costa, & Nogueira, 2013; Santos, 2013) effectively rendering the lawa site of (relational) discrimination.The understanding of the precise workings of political and legislative influ-ences and how these affect the lives of older gay and bisexual men in Portugalwarrants further research. As suggested by minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003),such exposure to stigma and discrimination are risk factors for physical andmental health problems (Lyons & Hosking, 2014; Woodford, Han, Craig,Lim, & Matney, 2014), both at a subjective level (highlighting individual pro-cesses of coping with stress and adversity) and at an objective level (highlightingobjective properties of the stressors). The clear articulation of such adversesocial conditions demands a critical gerontological perspective, creating theneed to recognize configurations and spaces, however marginal and minor,such as LGB older people. Critical gerontology’s approach is to identify and2 The International Journal of Aging and Human Development 0(0)to discuss how sociocultural categories and historical influences are rooted inpolitical meanings, and how these political and social symbols impact the agingexperience, and also in the way it can be studied. Addressing the internalstrengths of critical gerontology as a resourceful thought-space tool is key tounderstanding the political and ideological forces that govern the growing het-erogeneity of aging configurations in our present time (Cole, Achenbaum,Jakobi, & Kastenbaum, 1993).Parallel to the unprecedented growth of the older population, there has been asignificant increase in the visibility of LGB people. However, owing to issuesof disclosure and stigma, it remains very difficult to know how many olderLGB people there are and their particular needs (de Vries & Croghan,2014)—especially in an international context. Cohort and context are significantfactors. The older gay and bisexual men of today (the focus of this article) wereborn and raised in adverse historical and social contexts, where homosexualitywas regarded as a mental illness, and persecution and discrimination were sadlycommon, creating conditions of fear and anticipation of rejection (Haber, 2009).Such conditions were exacerbated during the early years of the AIDS pandemicwith experiences that have been pervasive and far-reaching linked to isolation,loneliness, and a closeted life (Dickinson, Cook, Playle, & Hallett, 2012) and,importantly, resilience and hardiness (de Vries, in press).Notwithstanding significant social and legislative changes over the livesof these older gay and bisexual men, the literature is replete with reports ofalienation, social isolation, ageist or body-type exclusions, invisibility, andrelated increased stress and loneliness among older gay men (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Kim, Shiu, Goldsen, & Emlet, 2015; Iwasaki & Ristock, 2007). Theanticipation of the need for support with the most likely health needs and/orassisted care is associated with concerns about who might be available and/orhaving to reveal one’s sexual orientation and be subject to further rejection ordisdain (Hughes, 2009; Neville & Henrickson, 2010) in a heteronormative care-giving context (MacGabhann, 2015). Research has identified the presence ofboth homophobia and heterosexism in healthcare organizations, as well asamong health professionals (Adams, McCreanor, & Braun, 2008), perpetuatingthe invisibility and marginalization of LGB individuals (Knochel, Quam, &Croghan, 2011).Social support has been seen to buffer the exigencies of lives and aging(Snyder, Jenkins, & Joosten, 2007), but for older gay and bisexual men, suchnetworks take on even greater significance (Barker, Herdt, & de Vries, 2006).Gay and bisexual men in particular often struggle to maintain meaningful rela-tionships and family ties (Shippy, Singer, & Brennan, 2004); research hasdescribed the creation of communities of similarly stigmatized others to whomgay men can turn (de Vries, 2013). These ‘‘families of choice’’ are both encoura-ging constructions and merit some caution: on one hand, their presence signalsthe potential of support; on the other hand, the extent to which suchPereira et al. 3nontraditional families are accepted in more heteronormative institutional set-tings remains to be seen.Much research with older gay and bisexual men has focused on physicalhealth issues, including HIV/AIDS. This research has found that HIV-positivemen have higher health comorbidities and poverty probabilities (Lyons, Pitts,Grierson, Thorpe, & Power, 2010) and consume more toxic substances (Lyons,Pitts, & Grierson, 2013) including tobacco (Brennan-Ing, Porter, Seidel, &Karpiak, 2014; Ompad et al., 2014). Similar observations have been notedamong HIV-negative aging gay men as well (although higher rates of smokingare less commonly seen). Mental health issues have also been studied with simi-larly dramatic findings: For example, larger proportions of older gay men havebeen found to suffer from depression (Shippy et al., 2004), largely owing toexperiences with stigma and discrimination (Wight, LeBlanc, de Vries, &Detels, 2012), creating conditions of mental distress in more than 50% ofolder gay men (Lyons, Pitts, & Grierson, 2014).Often implicit in this more focused vision in the areas of physical and mentalillness research with older gay and bisexual men is how the men themselvesperceive the aging process. Some studies emphasize how, in addition to havingto deal with all the stereotypes associated with aging that also heterosexual menface, gay and bisexual men have to deal with the tendency of society to viewthem as ‘‘inverted’’ men (Wright & Canetto, 2009). Moreover, the reportedheightened ageism within the LGB community creates great pressure on thesemen often compelling them to seeing themselves as less valued than the gayyouth (Slevin, 2008).For all these reasons, the construction of a narrative associated with themeaning of being an older gay or bisexual man is a complex, multifacetedeffort, accommodating multiple possibilities and paths (Owen & Catalan,2012). Kushner, Neville, and Adams (2013) note that several areas deserve spe-cial attention in understanding the aging process in older gay and bisexual men;these include dealing with homophobia, establishing meaningful relationshipsand understanding the concerns about future care, keeping resilience and socialsupport as key aspects. Uncovering the aging perceptions of older gay andbisexual men will allows us to better understand the psychosocial care needsand adjust interventions.Articulating such issues and giving voice to the older gay and bisexual men inPortugal is a primary goal of our study. We correspondingly adopt a qualitativeapproach, made even more important, given that, to our knowledge, there areno studies on this subject in southern European countries such as Portugal.We present below the results of this research on the aging experiences and per-ceptions of older gay and bisexual men to weave lessons for a more inclusivepsychosocial intervention.4 The International Journal of Aging and Human Development 0(0)MethodsDesign and ProceduresWith qualitative research methodology (e.g., Denzin & Lincoln, 2008; Rowles &Schoenberg, 2002), this study used purposive sampling techniques (Patton, 1990;Palinkas et al., 2015) to recruit a final sample of 15 gay and 10 bisexualPortuguese men over 60 years of age. The methodological basis for this quali-tative study was critical gerontology (Bernard & Sharf, 2007), encouragingresearch questions that promote the understanding and manifestations ofsocial change in a particular group of people. This study followed Cole et al.(1993) to identify sources of oppression and interpret the content relatingto what it means to grow old as an older nonheterosexual man, according toMeyer’s minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003).Information about the study was disseminated through Portuguese LGBassociations and community centers (such as International Lesbian and GayAssociation—Portugal, Opus Gay Association, and others), as well as throughmailing lists and social networks (e.g., members of nongovernmental agenciesand organizations that work with LGB people, internet forums, and Facebook).Participants responded to this outreach online by way of a website created forthis purpose. Following the study description and the clarification of the object-ives of the research, participants were asked to read and agree to informedconsent and acknowledge their voluntary participation, including issues ofconfidentiality.A total of 227 contacts with gay and bisexual men over 60 years were estab-lished. Inclusion criteria were as follows: self-identify as a gay or bisexual man,live in Portugal, speak Portuguese as their mother tongue, and be 60 or moreyears of age. All of those who responded were invited to complete a structuredinquiry consisting of a short section of sociodemographic questions (e.g., age,education, marital status, place of residence, and professional status) andanother section with questions designed according to the study main topicsand objectives. A set of 15 open-ended questions was developed by the authorsto guide the electronic data collection process (see Table 1).ParticipantsOf the total of 227 initial contacts, 25 men fully responded to the two question-naire sections and comprise the sample for these analyses. These men had anaverage age of 66.31 years (SD¼ 5.60), ranging from 60 to 82 years. Justover two-thirds (68%) of participants identified as gay and 32% as bisexual.In Table 2, we describe in greater detail all sociodemographic information of the25 participants in the study.Pereira et al. 5Data Analysis and ToolsThe data consisted of the direct transcriptions imported from the informationprovided by participants in the electronic questionnaires. We used thematicanalysis to identify repeated patterns of meaning through the data sets.Thematic analysis is not tied to any specific theoretical framework and can beapplied to various theories and methodological approaches (Joffe, 2011). Havingsuccessfully been applied to other studies in the area of critical gerontology,thematic analysis was assumed as inductive and data were obtained from thesemantic content and latent constructs inherent to the texts of the participants(Braun & Clarke, 2006). Several steps were involved in this process, namely:familiarizing with the data, generating initial codes, searching for themes,reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and producing the report.The questionnaire answers were systematically analyzed by the authors allow-ing analysis through a constant comparison process of the recurring themes andthe range of variation and nuances of each participant’s responses (Strauss &Corbin, 1990). Consistency of coding was assessed by comparing codificationsTable 1.

The following aredescriptions and discussion of these themes, providing illustrative quotes fromour participants.Positive Perceptions of AgingIn the discussions of aging as gay or bisexual men, many emphasized the need toaccept the transformations inherent in this new stage of developmental change,and the importance of having and maintaining good health, either physically ormentally. Several men identified specific tasks asked of them that had a particu-lar gay or bisexual focus (McParland & Camic, 2016), in both the psychologicaldomain, such as maintaining a sense of self, identity, and integrity and, in thesocial domain, such as maintaining bridges with social support systems andpersons:Aging is part of life, but even if I do not feel the age that I have, I think it is atall equal to heterosexual people, one becomes more mature and moreexperienced, more peaceful, although there are particular things for us such asAIDS, loneliness, loss of market value, but still, if we can maintain our autonomy,we gain more peace to be with ourselves and with others.

In this sense, it creates more self-respect. (Manuel, 70 years old,gay man)Along with the issues of aging shared with heterosexual persons, the gay andbisexual men of our sample noted some of the unique circumstances broughtabout by being gay or bisexual, and the changing conditions of their livesTable 3.

S represents which participant reported a given category while analyzing the results.10 The International Journal of Aging and Human Development 0(0)(e.g., the greater freedom and visibility). These changing conditions werereported having positive consequences on both identity and relationships asolder gay and bisexual men (Adelman, 1991; de Vries, 2015).Negative Perceptions Toward AgingOne of the main negative views toward aging among our participants has todo with body issues inherent in the physical aging process—again highlightingthe commonalities across persons of various sexual orientations. Interestingly,most of the respondents in our study reported to be in good health, bothphysically and psychologically, similar to what was found by much previousresearch (e.g., D’Augelli, Grossman, & O’Connel, 2001). Still, physicalhealth factors were noted. Sexual aspects were emphasized by several partici-pants, for example, including erectile dysfunction and loss of sexual interest.The men noted that these sexual dimensions were felt to be associated with a‘‘decline in the[ir] market value’’—a poignant and salient characteristicwith perhaps a more marked gay focus. That is, in the context of sexual inter-actions between men who have sex with men, they noted that youth is morevalued, and this was classified as a negative aspect associated with aging—evencompromising their identity (Slevin & Linneman, 2010), as reported by oneparticipant:This is a walk to death, the body no longer responds like it used to, sex doesn’thappen as I would like to and the truth is that people lose physical interest in me,I stopped having looks of interest, engaging smiles, and I face the risk of ending upalone. It is the evolution of life, I have to accept it, but the fact that I ceased to becoveted by younger gays makes me feel apart, makes me feel like I’m not special.(João, 64 years old, gay man)In a slightly different framing of this issue, several men referred to the fact that atthis stage of life, they see their sexuality denied by younger gay men, or by healthworkers and caregivers. Particularly in interactions with formal caregivers, it isboth the actual and anticipated experience of rejection that is seen as perpetuat-ing isolation (Stein, Beckerman, & Sherman, 2010) and ultimately challengingtheir self-identification as gay or bisexual men (Orel, 2014). For example, one ofthe participants stated:The fact that I am missing a few capabilities, and may have to ask for care becauseI live alone and have no one to take care of me, makes me anticipate that, by beinggay, a doctor, a nurse or an employee will look at me with mocking eyes or eventreat me badly. So I prefer not to say anything to anyone and I reserve the expres-sion of my intimacy to my sexual partners. I just spend time with back pain, legpain and loneliness. (Luı́s, 65 years old, gay man)Pereira et al. 11Coping With Being a Gay/Bisexual Man and Family TiesAs Putney (2014) notes, having active ways of dealing with new life circum-stances attenuates loneliness, encourages personal growth, promotes self-accep-tance, strengthens self-esteem, and provides a purpose. These were alsodimensions that our participants stressed in their responses, including the typeof resources they use to cope with aging and make it more successful. Theseincluded turning to family and friends (even as these same associates may notknow their sexual orientation), depending on the spouse or partner to give andreceive that support, and use these interpersonal resources to minimize the pos-sible effects of stigma and discrimination based on sexual orientation.Sometimes it’s very tiring and revolting to deal with prejudice, because I’m in thecloset. I often have to swallow my own pride and get away from the public image tobe able to live freely. So I take refuge in my family and closest friends, because eventhough they do not know about my sexuality, I have some attention, affection andrespect for the person I am, regardless of my sexual orientation. We get together onSaturdays for lunch, we catch up our conversation and I look like a normal person.I feel respected. (Joaquim, 65 years old, bisexual man)I have the great fortune to be respected by all. I have a small family, only twobrothers and five nephews, but everyone respects me and my partner. He cannotsay the same, so he took my family to be his. We’ve been together for 15 years andhe, at the beginning, didn’t accept himself. Much work was necessary to the ’nor-malization’ of what a homosexual relationship was in order for him to accept thingsfully. My family was crucial, perhaps because they have an open mind. My family isthe most important. (Roberto, 73 years old, bisexual man)Still, the aging experience may bring some additional challenges with regard tothe maintenance of a positive homosexual or bisexual identity, especially in thecontext of discrimination, oppression or harassment, explicit or implied, andmicro or macro aggressions, which involve subtle or overt heterosexist deliberateacts with the purpose of reaffirming stereotypes about the minority group (Sue,2010). Not losing self-respect, maintaining a sense of identity congruence andmaintaining the levels of openness and acceptance of this identity is critical—andthe role of one’s social network can be profound. Furthermore, as said by one ofour participants, much of this work involves building bridges with straightpeople:As gay man, I went through great hardship, because in my time no one could comeout as a gay man. I always did, but I quickly realized that my homosexuality didnot define myself. I had to make friends who accepted me for who I was, whetherstraight or gay. Today, almost all my friends are straight and they are like a real12 The International Journal of Aging and Human Development 0(0)family. Basically, they helped me to never lose respect for myself and gave me afundamental stability: they were always there for me. That is priceless. (Jorge,69 years old, gay man)Professional CareIn Portugal, there is a great paucity of studies and guidelines regarding thenature of formal care with older nonheterosexual people. For this reason,most of the participants reveal some apprehension and fear regarding the pos-sibility of 1 day needing this type of care, fearing the neglect, verbal, physical, orsexual harm reported in the formal care of older LGB individuals (Grossman,D’Augelli, & Hershberger, 2000; National Senior Citizens Law Center, 2011).For this reason, most participants stated that, should they require formal care,they wish it to be based on absolute principles of respect for sexual diversity,although there is a lot of ignorance about human sexuality in general and homo-sexuality in particular among service providers. This kind of professional atti-tude is seen as central to a successful aging with the LGB population (Kushneret al., 2013). As a participant stated:I do not think that there should be geriatric care only for LGB people, I think thiswould be a certain ghettoization, so I think it should be equal for all people;however, I think I would never enter a home, because I think they would neverunderstand me and accept me for who I am. I think there is a lot of ignorance onthe part of professionals and it did not take me a lifetime to accept my sexuality andthen get to the end of my days and having someone destroy it only by ignorance.I think the professionals still see homosexuality as a vice, with promiscuity, risk,panic, violence and would treat us like crazy dangerous people. (António, 80 yearsold, gay man)However, there are also participants expressing the hope that there is a genuinedesire to care for others occasioned by social changes, increased knowledge, andthe concomitant removal of misconceptions regarding LGB older people.Importantly, they also put the responsibility of change on the side of usersthemselves who will benefit from specialized care:I see no difference for someone who has to take care of an older man, whether he isheterosexual or homosexual. For me, health professionals have the obligation tounderstand and accept the person they care for and LGB people should be the firstto rely on professionals and no longer stay in the closet. If they do not speak, howwill others guess? I think the only way to break the loneliness circle is to be genuineand make our sexuality visible. At least that’s what I do and has never done meharm. –(Francisco, 74 years old, gay man)Pereira et al. 13Homophobia/DiscriminationAlthough there is at present greater social openness and more legal rights forLGB people in Portugal than in the past, it became clear that most of ourparticipants show some degree of internalization homonegativity as describedby cultural heterosexism and victimization experiences (Williamson, 2000)encouraging so many gay and bisexual men to stay in the closet. This kind ofinternal conflict may result in damage to self-esteem, potentially seriously com-promising the successful aging process in the older gay and bisexual men sur-veyed in our study. As Alberto, a 68-year-old gay man, said:As paradoxical as it may seem, I do not suffer discrimination out there becausenobody knows about my sexuality, but this at the cost of great suffering. I see withgreat anguish examples of homophobia and think it might be happening to me andI feel fear and anxiety. I find it very bad when there are countries in the world thatcultivate hatred toward LGB people. So I find myself having two faces: when I’mwith other gay men they know about me, but when I’m with straight people, theydo not know anything. This creates many difficulties and always have to hold backin social situations.Relationships and Social SupportMost men in this study noted the importance of having rewarding sources ofemotional and social support by establishing meaningful relationships. At thesame time, most of the men found themselves alone, expressed a desire to breakthe solitude, but encountered difficulties in doing so because of obstacles theyassociated with age (Kong, 2012). The fact that most of them have already retiredfrom their professional activities both increased availability for socializing andlimited the potential pool of new personal encounters. For most participants, theuse of technological communication tools provided the opportunities to begin tobreak the isolation and build new bridges with social support:I have few relevant relationships, I confess. But I have followed the new technol-ogies and feel that all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, are more likelynow to make contacts via facebook, email, phone, text messaging, than before. I donot know if it’s disturbing, but I think it’s a trend to which I will adapt. (Paul,61 years old, bisexual man)Intergenerational DifferencesThe focus on youth that exists in the LGB community causes invisibility and aninvalidation of older gay and bisexual men (Murray & Adam, 2001), which can14 The International Journal of Aging and Human Development 0(0)exacerbate the feelings of rejection, prejudice associated with age, and wide-spread intolerance. Interestingly, some men emphasized the generationalchanges associated with changes of values as something positive, giving rise tointergenerational differences that benefit the young and not the older gay andbisexual men as a reflection of expressed ambivalence:In my day we did not have access to information like there is today; in my youth wewould value more fellowship, the ethics of relations, the sense of commitment...Nowadays, people have an easier time coming out because they feel that they willbe more accepted and supported by friends and family, but they always turn theirbacks to older gay men, they are not able to socialize with us. (Fernando, 70 yearsold, bisexual man)In this sense, compared with gay and bisexual younger men, our participantsidentified the significant developmental milestones that improved the quality oflife of younger LGB people, while recognizing their generational hurdles anddelay which are not comparable with current social circumstances that are morefavorable (Drasin et al., 2008). As Júlio, a 69-year-old gay man, said:Young people today have more freedom, more openness to be themselves, moreacceptance, but fewer responsibilities. They jiggle around relationships and do notunderstand the true meaning of fellowship, both in love relationships and friend-ships. They are very immature and live for aesthetics, for pleasure, for hedonismand do not see older gay men as mentors or historical examples that might helpthem consolidate their identity. There is a huge gap between us, it is unfortunatethat this greater openness there is now does not bring the youth and the oldertogether.Mediating Role of Sexual OrientationThe understanding and social acceptance of homosexuality has evolved in recentdecades in Portugal and in most Western countries, directly affecting the per-sonal experiences of older men who witnessed these transformations, simultan-eously suspicious and gratified. For some men, these constraints were moresignificant in the field of social openness, or in the sexual domain, and forothers in the field of conformity to social pressure, appearing to be heterosexual,having girlfriends and having to marry them:If it was today I would not have married. I had to make choices of which I’m notproud, I hurt people, although it was not on purpose. In adolescence had verydifficult periods, I went through depression, but I was able to make the necessarychanges: after the children were raised, I divorced my wife and I managed to getPereira et al. 15a boyfriend, with whom I maintain a special and wonderful relationship that haslasted for 17 years now.– (Humberto, 66 years old, bisexual man)However, most of the participants described not having felt conditioned bysociety, due to the ability to implement their personal desires and not allowtheir sexual orientation to interfere with the motivation to fight for their lifevalues. They revealed that real change happened after they have truly acceptedtheir sexual orientation to themselves and to the significant people around them:I have always chosen my path, with intelligence, with ease and without worryingabout what others think of me. However, my life only changed from the momentI came out when I was 24, because at that time I became free from fear and held thereins of my happiness, even if I hit head on the walls some times, but I stood alwayswith dignity and never let anybody put me down. (Pedro, 72 years old, gay man)Thus, as claimed by Caceres and Frank (2016), sexual orientation acceptanceand integration for older LGB people may be positively associated with personalattributes such as optimism, the commitment to change and resilience, which arepresent among most of our participants.Sociopolitical ChangesPortugal, in recent years, witnessed major socio–political changes (as previouslyarticulated) that affected the perceptions of aging in our participants. For exam-ple, as Mário, a 62-year-old gay man, tells us:[the new law] allowed my marrying to my partner of three decades, ensuring legalissues in this way, although the main purpose was the celebration of our love to thestate and now legally are the family of each other. There is nothing more wonderfulthan being able to grow old with the person who you love and are committed to.However, for most men, the sociopolitical changes did not affect at all theireveryday lives because:Despite the increased feeling of social protection, the new laws do not affect mepersonally, because I do not think about getting married, I do not think aboutadopting a child and I do not see how these legal changes (which are good, ofcourse), will affect me for the better of my aging as a gay man. Maybe they do, butI do not see how. (Alberto, 68 years old, gay man)As suggested by Fassin and Salcedo (2015), political changes may not directlyaffect individual identities. Thus, effort is needed for the legislative and policymeasures to normalize the LGB identities, truly addressing the subjective16 The International Journal of Aging and Human Development 0(0)ambivalence that exists in Portuguese society. Countering the pervasive hetero-sexism and intolerance toward (older) LGB people will create conditions forfacilitating the social inclusion of sexual minorities.Personal CharacteristicsNaturally, personal characteristics also influenced the perception of agingamong our participants. Given that most of the men in our sample had advancedacademic training, as well as material conditions to survive comfortably in thisperiod of life, it may be said that these favorable socioeconomic backgroundsfacilitated narratives that reflected empowerment and self-efficacy. Along suchlines, the personal characteristics revealed in the texts included: maturity, calm-ness, common sense, the joy of living, the sense of justice, coherence, autonomy,honesty, and sense of normality (interpreted as appearing to be equal to hetero-sexual people).For many of our participants, the way to become comfortable with them-selves may have involved a full acceptance of their personal characteristics,including their homosexuality or bisexuality. As stated by Neville, Kushner,and Adams (2015), many gay and bisexual men have gone through ‘‘troubled’’paths leading to the persons they have become; over the course of this process,they have built up internal resources that allowed them to assert and consolidatean ideally integrated sense of acceptance of their nonheterosexuality throughconfrontation with a hegemonic sexual group, who is necessarily different:Being a mature gay man is a very good thing, I would not change it for beingheterosexual. From an early age I learned that I had to live with my difference, tobe the person I am without fear or taboos. I am a humanist, reserved, assertive,humorous, serious and rigorous, affectionate, true and front, loyal and supportiveolder man. This, much more than being gay, is what defines me. (Carlos, 68 yearsold, gay man)Overall DiscussionThe main objective of this qualitative research was to understand and examinethe perceptions of the aging process with a sample of Portuguese gay and bisex-ual men over 60 years of age. The absence of data of this kind in Portugal isnoteworthy and we hope our study begins to fill this void. We further hope thatthe results may inform programs of social awareness to facilitate inclusion,psychological acceptance by others, physical visibility, and increased participa-tion in social life of gay and bisexual older men.Notwithstanding concerted efforts in outreach, twice as many of our respond-ents identified as gay as compared with those who identify as bisexual.Pereira et al. 17Several reasons may account for this imbalance. There are unique stressorsassociated with bisexuality including biphobia; in fact, it may be proposedthat bisexual older men are exposed to triple sources of stress: homophobia,biphobia, and ageism. Such experiences may limit the public declaration of one’sbisexual orientation—and their participation rates in such research.Several evocative patterns emerge from the results reported earlier. First,respondents reported much about which to be positive when speaking aboutthe perceptions of aging. In many regards, these positive views superseded sexualorientation—that is, aging is aging, whether gay, bisexual, or heterosexual.When sexual orientation was raised in this framework, it was frequently seenas an advantage offering a chance to be at peace with themselves. Severalauthors have similarly noted these features of what has been identified as posi-tive marginality (e.g., de Vries, 2015; Unger, 2000). Without dismissing the manyhardships brought about by stigma and discrimination, so too do LGBT personsnote the ways in which their marginal status has provided a way to carve out alife of creative authenticity.Negative aspects were, of course, raised: Growing old is associated with agradual decline of some physical and cognitive capabilities. Many of these issuessupplant sexual orientations. But there is one aspect in particular that contrastssignificantly in this group, which is inevitably the lack of family support: manyof the men interviewed have no direct family of their own, no children andgrand-children, accentuating the perception of perceived isolation, and theoccurrence of more health problems when compared with their heterosexualpeers (Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2013).Also, sadly balancing the positive marginality previously discussed were thepervasive and toxic experiences of stigma and discrimination. Many of the menspoke of their encounters with what they perceived as homophobia and/or dis-crimination, which points directly to the perceived lack of social awarenessabout LGBT lives. This situation causes people to protect themselves againstpossible mistreatment and disdain, including choosing to stay in the closet, beinvisible to society, or not disclosing their sexual orientation, which directlylimits the possibilities of expression within society. Such limits have many ofthe consequences previously enumerated, facilitating isolation and loneliness,and compromising the expression of a basic aspect of all human beings: beingfree with who they are. Therefore, our results are congruent with other studiesthat demonstrate the negative impact of social discrimination on the well-beingof LGB people (Pereira & Costa, 2016), and especially on the well-being of olderLGB people (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2015).The dilemma noted from identifying as gay or bisexual is worth emphasizing.On one hand, a large majority thinks that the situation would improve if theycame out of the closet; that is, if they made their sexual orientation more sociallyvisible, which in turn would make them stand in the same situation as any otherperson and this would allow them to express freely their nature without fears of18 The International Journal of Aging and Human Development 0(0)being rejected by society—or willing to live with the consequences. On the otherhand, many men are willing to pay the price involved in not disclosing theirsexual identity because they would be out in a very vulnerable situation withoutinterest or strength to fight against homophobia, rejection, or exclusion.Knowing that there is a positive correlation between coming out and psycho-logical adjustment (Riggle & Rostosky, 2009; Rosario, Scrimschaw, & Hunter,2011), the fear associated with rejection and discrimination can lead to olderLGB people to not seek health care, especially in highly vulnerable situations(Brotman, Ryan, & Cormier, 2003) and therefore elevate risks of mental healthproblems, such as suicide, bereavement, substance abuse, or verbal andphysical violence (McCann, Shareka, Higginsa, Sheerina, & Glackenb, 2013).Importantly, only an insignificant percentage of participants state that theymake their homosexual or bisexual identity visible; that is, most hide it through-out society and even in closer environments, such as friends and family. Thecosts and consequences of such guardedness may be substantial and worthy offurther study.The role of social support was raised in several forms, speaking to its criticalimportance. Such issues were mentioned directly in discussions about relation-ships (along with challenges in the maintenance of such relationships) and withreference to intergenerational ties (often framed in terms of how circumstanceshave changed for younger gay and bisexual men, relative to the formative experi-ences of our older sample). Indirectly, support was mentioned in the context ofnegative aging perceptions and the limitations of aging experienced by LGB(T)persons, owing to unique marital and family ties.Many of these unique ties were framed and seen as consequences of personalcharacteristics—both a key theme as well as an implicit reference. It is a sadstatement that in today’s society with all the scientific, technical, and academicprogress, the well-being of sexual minorities is still jeopardized by bigotry andignorance. While disparities are still a reality, there are also important contri-butions to understanding positive or successful aging patterns, highlighting theimportance of community involvement and resilience (Van Wagenena, Driskell,& Bradford, 2013).Close to half of all respondents were single, comparable to North Americanresearch, perhaps owing to both internalization of heteronormative standardsand roles, related to what some have called ‘‘gay ageism’’ (Wight, LeBlanc,Meyer, & Harig, 2015) and the freedom afforded by a life at the margins (asso-ciated with relationships of a less traditional nature, de Vries, 2009). Relatedly,more than half of our participants lived alone. Being single and living alonerenders access to caregiving more problematic with increasing reliance on formalservices—itself an expressed concern about aging and justifiably so, at leastaccording to U.S. research (SAGE, 2010).A similarly influential but more potentially affirmative characteristic of thesample is their degree of training and education: over 50% of our participantsPereira et al. 19are well educated (comparable to North American research—de Vries, 2013).Such resources can positively influence the understanding of how individualsperceive themselves, allowing them to conceptualize life and all that it encom-passes from a broad perspective on possibilities and knowledge of any realitythat has to do with life, the human being, and the person in general.ImplicationsThe present study challenges professionals who work with older clients to recon-sider their approach to people who do not identify as heterosexual and to beopen to consider that among their older clients are individuals who do notidentify as heterosexual. In the case of this study inclusive of older gay andbisexual men, service providers and health-care professionals are encouragedto be cognizant that these men (as well as lesbian and bisexual women, as wellas those who identify as transgender) have experienced years of stigmatization,marginalization, discrimination, and victimization from all corners of societyincluding health professionals. The costs of such assaults on the self-conceptsof these men merit attention—so too do the resources they have developed tocope with and even thrive in later life. It is therefore important that all profes-sionals examine their own ideas and prejudices of same-sex attracted people todeliver competent and culturally safe care.Evident in the findings was the importance placed on having good socialsupport networks and diminishing the feelings of loneliness. Consequently,any assessment undertaken with older gay and bisexual men should includeinformation on an individual’s support networks. In addition, professionalsworking with older gay and bisexual men need to ensure that health-care envir-onments are open, respectful, and use inclusive language. Doing so will increaseolder gay and bisexual men’s confidence that should they require health-careservices, these will be delivered in a way that is sensitive and appropriate(Gardner, de Vries, & Mockus, 2014).LimitationsThis study is not without limitations. First, there was the potential for selectionbias as the study was advertised in gay and bisexual-oriented social-networkingvenues and as such did not capture those men who did not frequent these places.Consequently, all participants self-identified as gay or bisexual, yet not all menwere ‘‘out,’’ suggesting the possibility of having gained access to a somewhathidden group. Further research exploring the perceptions of these hidden groupsof older gay and bisexual men would be useful.Given the qualitative nature of this study, we chose not to separate analysisby sexual orientation, not only because of the small number of participants ineach category (gay and bisexual) but also because we consider that the20 The International Journal of Aging and Human Development 0(0)generational effect affecting Portuguese older gay and bisexual men are trans-versal to both groups since they represent a hidden sexual minority consistentlyexposed to sexual stigma. Despite the fact that our objective was to assess theperceptions of aging among men both gay and bisexual, future research shouldinclude bigger samples comparing specificities by sexual orientation.Alternatively, most participants were well educated and of middle-class,which constitutes a threat to transferability of results. As this is a commonproblem in LGB aging research, it would be useful if future studies could includethose older gay and bisexual men from a variety of socioeconomic groups andeducational backgrounds, as well as the use of complementary methodologies,such as: in depth face-to-face interviews, focus groups, or Research ActionPlans. However, the intention of this study was not to generalize the findingsto all older gay and bisexual men, but, through the usage of a critical geronto-logical lens, foreground the voices of this group so that their perceptions ofageing, as well as how they would like to be treated by health professionals,are heard. Furthermore, this perspective allowed the identification of severalsources of oppression and interpret the meanings of what it is like to age asan older gay or bisexual male in Portuguese culture, facilitating dialogue, ques-tioning of source of oppression, and promoting of values which are committedto social change for this group of people, ensuring the implementation of pre-judiced-free practice guidelines.ConclusionOlder Portuguese gay and bisexual men live in interesting times. There have beensignificant changes in the legislative and social plans in Portugal that benefitLGB people, recognizing their legal and social rights and providing older gayand bisexual men greater visibility in society; at the same time, LGB older per-sons live with both the legacy and contemporary experience of homophobia andstigma, complicated by the tension of ageism (Richards, 2011). The challengesthat older gay and bisexual men face in their day-to-day confrontation with thistension of stigma and increasing visibility may in fact lead to greater vulnerabil-ity. That is, gay and bisexual men are more likely to be alone or with fewerfamily and less social support than older heterosexual people (Knocker, 2006),have greater difficulties in accessing health care that is sensitive to their specificneeds, and may feel uncomfortable revealing their sexual orientation, thus creat-ing aggravated severity of circumstances added to the natural loss of autonomy,mobility, and vitality associated with this stage of life development (Heaphy,Yip, & Thompson, 2003).The study of LGB aging is the examination of diversity, of culture, of limi-tations and possibilities, and from this, we learn about the varying and fluidroles of sexual identity and aging that the cultural scripts shape during this stagein life (de Vries, 2007). The study of aging perception in gay and bisexual men isPereira et al. 21a timely addition to theoretical, empirical, and practical literatures in gerontol-ogy, psychogerontology, nursing, medical, and psychosocial care with much tocontribute to understanding of aging and sexual identity under stigmatized con-ditions. Our results also offer much to an analysis of aging more generally,fostering a more holistic and inclusive view of the social and personal experi-ences of older people.Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,authorship, and/or publication of this article.FundingThe authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publicationof this article.ReferencesAdams, J., McCreanor, T., & Braun, V.

    "abstract": "Aims and Objectives The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions toward aging among Portuguese gay and bisexual men over 60 years old. Background Despite the growth of the older population, and the increased visibility and acceptance of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people in Western countries, the experience of aging in older gay and bisexual men is only beginning to be understood. Design We used a qualitative research methodology, based on critical gerontology, for establishing research questions and to identify the perspectives on the aging process in older gay and bisexual individuals. Methods We used a structured electronic inquiry with 25 gay and bisexual men over 60 years of age from Portugal. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis to help identify repeated patterns of meaning in the data set. Results The recurrent themes in the narratives of the aging experiences of the participants in the study were as follows: positive perceptions of aging, negative perceptions of aging, coping with being a gay/bisexual man and family ties, professional care, homophobia/discrimination, relationships and social support, intergenerational differences, mediating role of sexual orientation, sociopolitical changes, and personal characteristics. Conclusion Analysis of perceptions about the aging process in older gay and bisexual men emphasized the desire for normalization in the social awareness of sexual orientation. It is important to continue doing research on this topic and disseminate this information among professionals who work with older lesbian, gay, and bisexual people so that they may better understand how they can meet the specific needs of this population.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",
