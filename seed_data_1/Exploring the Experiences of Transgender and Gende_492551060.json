Usingdata from the 2015 United States Trans Survey (N = 27,715), this study looks at the differences withinthe TGD population regarding having seen a doctor in the past year, having a primary care provider,and having a primary care provider who is knowledgeable about trans health. Logistic regressionsindicate that even within an all transgender and gender diverse sample, a variety of identities andexperiences are related to increased or decreased likelihood of each of these outcomes, with signifi-cant differences across gender, race/ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, disability status, educationalattainment, annual income, disability status, religiosity, military status, overall health, housing status,and insurance coverage. Not only should there be an effort to support transgender and genderdiverse individuals in accessing care, but there is a clearly indicated need for additional education forhealthcare providers, especially those doing primary care, on how to offer knowledgeable, affirming,and intersectional care to their patients.Keywords: health; transgender; gender diverse; primary care; healthcare; gender identity; United States1. IntroductionResearch has shown that transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals experi-ence a variety of challenges when it comes to accessing healthcare. Some of these issues aredue to transphobia, and many TGD patients have experienced discrimination, harassment,and even physical harm at the hands of healthcare providers [1–3]. Others may delay carefor fear of these things, due to lack of insurance and/or funds, not having a trans knowl-edgeable provider nearby, or a plethora of other reasons. A trans knowledgeable provideris someone who is not only respectful to their TGD patients through using their correctname and pronouns, but one that also has knowledge of the unique health needs facingTGD individuals, such as hormone prescriptions (and interactions) and gender-affirmingsurgery options and referrals, and also recognizes that TGD individuals will experiencesimilar concerns to their cisgender patients, such as having the flu, or needing a brokenarm to be healed. However, the TGD population is not a monolithic group, and so evenunder the TGD umbrella, there are differences in who is able to go to the doctor, who hasa primary care provider (PCP), and whose PCPs are knowledgeable about issues relatedto TGD health and healthcare. This study explores within group differences across thesethree outcomes.We use the phrase TGD to encompass those whose gender differs from hegemonicWhite/European social expectations related to the sex that they were assigned at birth. ThisInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 13057. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413057 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerphInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 13057 2 of 14umbrella term includes individuals who may transition from one gender to another—suchas transgender women and transgender men—as well as those who do not identify withina gender binary, including those who identify as genderqueer, two-spirit (an identityspecific to Indigenous individuals), nonbinary, agender, etc.Access to Care. Transgender and gender diverse people (TGD) experience negativehealth outcomes because of systemic oppression [1], and are often required to navigatea healthcare system that can be openly hostile toward TGD individuals [2]. A primaryreason for these negative outcomes is that TGD individuals often do not have or havedifficulty accessing healthcare. The extant literature shows that TGD adults are less likelyto access primary and specialty healthcare services than their cisgender (non-transgender)peers [3]. Among TGD young adults, 35% received a routine check-up in the past yearcompared to 49%–58% of cisgender young adults [4,5]. Additionally, a study based inPhiladelphia found that more than 50% of TGD participants experienced challenges whenaccessing one or more healthcare services in the past year [6].A common barrier for TGD people when attempting to access care is inadequatelytrained medical providers [7]. This occurs across health specialties, including primary care,surgical care, obstetrics and gynecology, and endocrinology [8,9]. As a result, TGD peopleare often burdened with teaching their medical providers about their health, leadingmany to feel alienated by the medical system due to their healthcare needs not beingmet [10]. Findings from the Virginia Transgender Initiative Health study, a study thatsurveyed 350 TGD individuals, showed an alarming lack of TGD-friendly and competentproviders [11], and results from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N = 6450)indicated that 50% of TGD respondents had to educate their medical providers aboutbasic transgender health information [12]. Due to the lack of adequately trained medicalproviders, TGD people are unable to find healthcare that meets their needs [13,14].Insurance issues are often another barrier for TGD people attempting to access health-care services. Not having health insurance is tied to higher rates of healthcare harassmentand discrimination [15]. In the United States, 14% of TGD people do not have health insur-ance compared to 11% of cisgender people [16]. This is amplified for people of color, as onestudy found that 25.7% of TGD people of color did not have health insurance compared to17% of white TGD people [17]. Even when TGD people do have health insurance that sup-posedly covers gender-affirming care, insurance companies often set payout limits belowthe cost of needed gender-affirmation procedures or refuse to pay for these procedures,resulting in covered care being unattainable for many [18]. Additionally, most people inthe U.S. receive health insurance through their employers [19], which creates additionalbarriers for TGD individuals since they are more likely to experience discrimination in theworkplace and unemployment than cisgender individuals [16].Sexual orientation. Generally, among TGD populations, individuals describe theirsexual attractions, identities, and behaviors more expansively than among cisgender popu-lations. For example, in the TransPop Survey, which used a national probability sample oftransgender adults and compared them to a random sample of cisgender adults, among themost common sexual orientations among the transgender groups were bisexual, queer, andpansexual, as well as heterosexual [20]. In contrast, cisgender adults are most likely to saythat they are heterosexual, bisexual, gay, or lesbian [21,22]. Past research suggests that TGDindividuals who have a sexual orientation other than heterosexual (or, in some cases, asex-ual) tend to be more likely to experience mistreatment in healthcare. In an analysis of theexperiences of transgender men within the United States Transgender Survey (USTS) [23],queer transgender men were more likely to have to teach a doctor about transgender-related issues, be asked invasive questions, and experience any mistreatment in healthcarecompared to most other orientation groups. Meanwhile, asexual and heterosexual trans-gender men were less likely to be asked invasive questions or have a doctor use harshor abusive language compared to bi/pansexuals and those with an orientation not listedon the survey [23]. In another paper using USTS data [24], TGD individuals who wereasexual had the lowest risks for mistreatment in healthcare, followed by bi/pansexualInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 13057 3 of 14and heterosexual individuals; those who were lesbian, gay, same-gender-loving, queer, oran orientation not listed had the greatest risks of poor treatment by healthcare providers.This evidence suggests that LGBQ + TGD patients may have less access to culturallyresponsive, knowledgeable healthcare providers and/or experience a greater risk of dis-crimination in healthcare than heterosexual TGD counterparts.Race. In terms of race, people of color in general are more likely to experience formsof discrimination in healthcare settings compared to their white counterparts [25]. Whenexamining the intersections of gender and race in terms of healthcare access, TGD individ-uals of color are more likely to experience refusal of care and discrimination in healthcaresettings than their white TGD peers [15]. This discrimination occurs in emergency roomsand with doctors, hospitals, and EMTs [26]. Additionally, TGD feminine people of colorexperience much higher rates of refusal of care from providers than TGD white individualsand TGD masculine people of color [27]. Moreover, TGD men and women who are mul-tiracial and TGD men who are Native American are more likely to delay medical care dueto discrimination [28].Disability status. Shifting to disability status, according to the 2010 U.S. CensusBureau [29], 21.3% of people over 15 years old had a disability or impairment. Althoughnearly one quarter of the U.S. population has a disability or impairment, disabled peopleare significantly more likely to experience victimization in many settings [30], includinghigh rates of discrimination in healthcare [31,32]. When looking at the intersections of gen-der identity and disability, TGD disabled adults experience higher rates of discriminationin mental healthcare settings. In the same study, TGD disabled adults with multiple disabil-ities and impairments were significantly more likely to have experienced discriminationthan their non-disabled peers [33].Age. Although there is limited healthcare research regarding the intersection of TGDindividuals and age, similar patterns of adverse health outcomes that impact young andmiddle-aged TGD adults persist into older adulthood [34,35]. The existing literature showsthat LGBT older adults report more chronic health conditions and poorer health-relatedquality of life than heterosexual, cisgender older adults [36]. TGD older adults have poorerhealth in terms of physical health, mental health, disability, and perceived stress comparedto non-TGD older adults [37]. In addition to poor health outcomes, 40% of TGD olderadults report receiving poor quality of care or being denied healthcare because of theirsexual orientation and/or gender identity [38].Education level. In looking at education level, there is not a lot of research examiningthe intersections of education level, gender identity, and healthcare experiences. Accordingto a 2015 study with TGD men, having a graduate degree was associated with increasedreports of discrimination in healthcare settings [39]. This study concluded that stigmaand power play a role in healthcare interactions, and that this finding may explain therelationship between reporting discrimination and higher education levels. Jaffee et al. [28]also found that education level influences the choice to delay healthcare due to fear ofdiscrimination. Additionally, those with less than a high school education have a greaterodds of experiencing unwanted sexual contact, being verbally harassed, and experiencingvictimization in healthcare settings than those with a bachelor’s degree [40].Insecure housing/homelessness. Much extant literature on housing insecurity andhomelessness among the TGD population centers around the experiences of TGD youth,as found in multiple systematic reviews [41,42]. Limited research on housing insecurityamong TGD adults provides exploratory associations between health and wellness andexperiencing homelessness. Multiple studies have explored the link between behavioralhealth outcomes, such as higher likelihood of depression, substance use, and suicidalityamong TGD individuals experiencing housing insecurity [41–43]. One qualitative studyfound that housing insecurity among TGD individuals is associated with having multiplemarginalized identities, experiences of discrimination, and the challenges of accessinghealthcare when houseless [43].Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 13057 4 of 14Religiosity. Limited research exists that explores religiosity among TGD individuals.One study exploring unprotected sexual behaviors among transgender women foundthat those with higher levels of religiosity were more likely to engage in unprotectedsex [44]. Another study explored the impact of religious loss or rejection from a griefframework, noting that many TGD individuals feel that they must choose between theirfaith and their gender. This forced decision to give up religion may cause psychologicaldistress [45]. Much more research is necessary to understand the associations betweenhealth and religiosity among TGD individuals.Military status. Members of the military, and especially veterans of the U.S. military,have had many challenges experiencing discrimination through military healthcare and atthe VA [46,47]. There is a paucity of research in this area, and more research is needed toexplore how this impacts the health of active service members and military veterans.Research QuestionTGD individuals have many different experiences when trying to access healthcare,depending on their other identities and life experiences, yet little is known about howsociodemographic factors and these experiences may be connected to being able to accesshealthcare providers. Based on this gap, this study addresses three questions, whilecontrolling for sociodemographic factors (e.g., gender, sexual orientation, race, age, class,and disability) and other experiences (e.g., educational level, religiosity, whether theyhave secure housing, military status): (1) how many TGD individuals see a physicianon a yearly basis; (2) how many TGD individuals have a regular primary care provider(PCP); and (3) how many of these individuals have a PCP who they would consider to beknowledgeable about transgender health?2. Materials and Methods2.1. DesignThe present study conducted a secondary data analysis on the 2015 United StatesTransgender Survey (USTS), which surveyed 27,715 TGD adults across the United States.The survey was available online in both English and Spanish, and participants were re-cruited via convenience sampling online and through organizational partners. Respondentsprovided information about a variety of topics, including demographics, healthcare ac-cess history, and how knowledgeable healthcare professionals were of TGD health andhealth needs. An in-depth description of survey methods can be found in the report byJames et al. [16]. Data were provided to the first author, analysis occurred in 2021, and IRBexemption was ascertained by the first author.2.2. MeasuresDependent Variables. The first dependent variable in this study was the dichotomousyes/no question: “In the past year, have you seen a doctor or healthcare provider?”. The nextdependent variable determined if participants had a primary care physician (PCP). Thisvariable was created through two questions. The first, “How much does your routine health-care provider (who you see for physicals, flu, diabetes, etc.) know about healthcare for transpeople”, had response options of “I don’t have a routine healthcare provider”, “They knowalmost everything about trans healthcare”, “They know most things”, “They know somethings”, “They know almost nothing”, and “I am not sure”. Due to survey skip logic, thisquestion was not asked of participants who indicated not currently having a trans-relateddoctor or provider. To represent participants who did have a provider for trans-relatedhealthcare, the following question was also used to construct the second dependent variable:“Do you also go to your trans-related healthcare provider for your routine healthcare, likephysicals, flu, diabetes, etc.?”. Response options included “Yes, I see my trans healthcareprovider for my routine healthcare”, “No, I see a different doctor or healthcare providerfor my routine healthcare”, and “No, I do not get any routine healthcare”.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 13057 5 of 14The newly created PCP variable was coded as a dichotomous yes/no variable. Thethird dependent variable assessed participant perception of how knowledgeable their PCPwas about trans care. This variable was created by combining the question “How muchdoes your routine healthcare provider (who you see for physicals, flu, diabetes, etc.) knowabout healthcare for trans people?” and “Thinking about the doctor or provider you go tofor your trans-related healthcare (such as hormone treatment), how much do they knowabout providing healthcare for trans people?”. The values for the original questions were“I don’t have a routine healthcare provider” or “I don’t have a trans-related doctor orhealthcare provider right now”, “They know almost everything about trans healthcare”,“They know most things”, “They know some things”, “They know almost nothing”, and “Iam not sure”.Independent Variables. Independent variables included gender, sexual orientation,age, education, insurance coverage, income, ability status, military history, race/ethnicity,overall health, housing, and religiosity. To avoid misrepresenting identities, the labels usedin the original questionnaire for gender were kept the same. This question asked, “If youhad to choose only one of the following terms, which best describes your current genderidentity?”. Response options included cross-dresser, woman, man, trans woman, trans man,and non-binary/genderqueer. Age was collected as a continuous variable and remainedthe same for this analysis. Ability was measured through a single dichotomous “yes” or“no” question: “Do you identify as a person with a disability?”. Religiosity was measuredby the question, “What is your current religious or spiritual identity?”. Participants whoreported being atheist, agnostic, or having no religious or spiritual affiliation were codedas not religious/spiritual, while those who marked any other religious identity were codedas religious/spiritual.Sexual orientation was measured through the question, “What best describes yourcurrent sexual orientation?”. For analytic purposes, asexual and demisexual were combinedinto one larger asexual/demisexual value, and same-gender loving was included withadditional orientations.Race and ethnicity were assessed through the question, “Although the choices listedbelow may not represent your full identity or use the language you prefer, for this sur-vey please select the choice that most accurately describes your racial/ethnic identity.(Please choose only one answer)”. Alaskan Native, Middle Eastern/North African, andNative Hawaiian/Pacific Islander were combined with the additional racial/ethnic identitycategory due to small sample sizes.Military history was assessed through the question, “Have you ever served on activeduty in the U.S. Armed Forces, Reserves, or National Guard?”. This variable was recodedinto a dichotomous “no” for those that selected “never served in the military” or “yes” forall other responses.Education was measured through the question, “What is the highest level of schoolor degree you have completed?”. These values were recoded into the final values of“Less than high school or GED”, “High school or GED”, “Associate degree (vocational oracademic)”, “Some college”, “Bachelor’s”, “Some grad school”, “Master’s”, and “Doctoralor professional degree”.Housing was measured through the question, “What are your current living ar-rangements?”. Response options were recoded into three values: “Personal housing”,“Congregate housing”, and “Insecure housing”.Household income was determined through the question “How much was your totalcombined household income (before taxes) in 2014?”. Response options included “Noincome”, “$1 to $9999”, “10,000 to 24,999”, “25,500 to 49,999”, “50,000 to 99,999”, “100,000or more.”Health insurance was measured by the question, “What type of health insurance orhealth coverage plan do you have? (Mark all that apply)”. This variable was recodedinto public insurance, private insurance, and military insurance. Participants who markedmultiple types of insurance were coded as having multiple insurances. Private insuranceInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 13057 6 of 14was used as the reference category. Health status was assessed through the question“Would you say that in general your health is. . . ”. Response options were “Excellent”,“Very good”, “Good”, “Fair”, and “Poor.”2.3. Data AnalysisBasic descriptive statistics were used to summarize participant attributes. Weightedlogistic regression analyses were conducted on the full sample to identify correlates ofhaving visited a physician in the past year, as well as whether participants had a PCP.Ordered logistic regression was then used to examine factors related to PCP TGD healthknowledge. Participants who indicated that they did not have a PCP or were uncertain ofhow knowledgeable their PCP was about TGD health were excluded from this analysis.Of the 27,715 participants in the sample, 2934 (10.59%) had missing data on one ormore variables. The percentage of cases missing ranged from 0% for gender to 8.7% forhousehold income. Multiple imputation was used to address missingness and preventloss of power associated with listwise deletion [48]. The mi chained command was used inStata 16 to generate 15 imputed datasets, which is in line with guidelines recommendingthat the number of imputed datasets be greater than the percentage of incomplete cases [49].The USTS data used weighting to correct for an overrepresentation of participants whowere 18 years old and white to better align with TGD population characteristics demon-strated in other studies [16]. Recommended sampling weights were used in regressionanalysis. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 16 [50].3. Results3.1. DemographicsParticipants’ demographics are detailed in Table 1. Nonbinary/genderqueer (34.2%)was the most frequently reported gender, followed by transgender men (21.1%), transgen-der women (20.3%), women (13.5%), men (8.3%), and cross-dressers (2.6%). A variety of sex-ual orientations were reported, including queer (20.6%), pansexual (18.2%), bisexual (14.9%),straight (12.1%), asexual/demisexual (11.8%), lesbian (11.0%), and gay (4.8%). The remain-ing 6.6% of the sample identified with additional orientations not included in the survey.Most of the sample was white (80.8%) and religious (62.2%), with an average age of31.2 years. Just under half of the sample had some form of college degree, 37.8% hadsome college education without a degree, 12.5% graduated from high school or got theirGED, and 3.3% did not have either a high school diploma or GED. Most of the samplewas insured (87.3%), and private insurance (61.5%) was the most reported type. Over halfof the sample (58.6%) belonged to households that made less than $50,000 a year, 25%made between $50,000 and $10,000, with the final 16.7% reporting an income of $100,000 ormore. In terms of health status, 80% of the sample reported overall health as being goodor better and 28% identified as having some form of disability.

Descriptive ResultsOverall, 87.4% (n = 24,161) of participants had visited a physician in the last year and76.6% (n = 21,013) had a PCP. Of those who had a PCP, 17.8% (n = 3724) of participantsreported that their PCP knew almost nothing about TGD health, 17.7% (n = 3709) thattheir PCP knew some things, 12.6% (n = 2643) that their PCP knew most things, and 15.2%(n = 3201) that their PCP knew almost everything. The remaining 36.7% (n = 7711) did notknow how much their PCP knew about TGD health.3.3. Regression Analyses3.3.1. Physician Visit in the Past YearThe first column in Table 2 shows a logistic regression exploring the associationbetween sociodemographic variables and having visited a physician in the past year. ThoseTGD individuals who identified as men were more likely to have gone to a physician in thepast year compared to women (OR 0.74, p = 0.023), trans women (OR 0.62, p < 0.001), transmen (OR 0.72, p = 0.006), nonbinary/genderqueer (OR 0.42, p < 0.001), and cross-dressers(OR 0.24, p < 0.001). In terms of race and ethnicity, those who were biracial or multiracial(OR 0.73, p = 0.003), Latino/a or Hispanic (OR 0.84, p = 0.041), and identified with additionalraces or ethnicities (OR 0.71, p = 0.034) were less likely than white individuals to havevisited a physician in the past year. Additionally, those who had insecure housing (OR 0.71,p < 0.001) were 30% less likely to visit a physician in the past year compared to thosewho had personal, non-congregate housing. Participants who reported being religiouswere more likely to have seen a physician in the past year than those who were notreligious (OR 1.22, p < 0.001). Participants who had some college without a degree (OR 1.59,p = 0.003), a Bachelor’s degree, some graduate school without a degree (OR 2.48, p < 0.001),a Master’s degree (OR 2.25, p < 0.001), and a doctorate or other professional degree (OR 1.73,p = 0.024) were more likely to have gone to a physician in the past year compared to thosewithout a high school diploma or GED. All forms of insurance were significantly relatedto having visited a physician; participants who had private (OR 3.75, p < 0.001), public(OR 4.89, p < 0.001), military (OR 3.33, p < 0.001), and multiple forms of insurance (OR 5.23,p < 0.001) all visited a physician more often than those who did not have insurance. Thosewho had one or more disabilities were almost two times more likely to report a physicianvisit in the past year compared to those without any disabilities (OR 1.83, p < 0.001).

J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 13057 9 of 143.3.2. Having a PCPThe second column of Table 2 illustrates a logistic regression that explores the as-sociation between having a PCP and the various sociodemographic predictor variables.Compared to those who identified as trans men, participants that identified as trans women(OR 0.81, p = 0.029), nonbinary/genderqueer (OR 0.72, p < 0.001), or cross-dressers (OR 0.40,p < 0.001) were less likely to have a PCP. Older participants (OR 1.03, p < 0.001) and par-ticipants who had served in the military (OR 1.28, p = 0.008), identified as religious orspiritual (OR = 1.16, p = 0.001), had one or more disabilities (OR 1.42, p < 0.001), andreported better overall health (OR 1.13, p < 0.001) were all more likely to have a PCP, whileparticipants with insecure housing (OR 0.63, p < 0.001) were less likely. Having private(OR 5.84, p < 0.001), public (OR 7.34, p < 0.001), military (OR 7.17, p < 0.001), and multiple(OR 6.70, p < 0.001) insurances were associated with between 5.5 and 7.5 times the odds ofhaving a PCP compared to not having insurance.3.3.3. PCP TGD KnowledgeOur analysis shown in the third column of Table 2 is an ordered logistic regressionamong those with a PCP, exploring the association between sociodemographic predictorsand how knowledgeable a participant’s PCP was about TGD health. Identifying as non-binary/genderqueer (OR 0.47, p < 0.001) or as a cross-dresser (OR 0.32, p < 0.001) wasassociated with reporting lower levels of PCP TGD health knowledge, while identifying asa transgender woman (OR 1.18, p = 0.049) was associated with higher levels of PCP TGDhealth knowledge. Lesbian (OR 0.83, p = 0.025), bisexual (OR 0.85, p = 0.040), and pansex-ual (OR 0.82, p = 0.021) participants, as well as those who identified with an additionalsexual orientation (OR 0.80, p = 0.021) had reduced odds of having a knowledgeable PCPcompared to straight peers, while queer (OR 1.28, p = 0.002) participants had higher odds.Asian/Asian American (OR 1.25, p = 0.032) and Black/African American participants(OR 1.64, p < 0.001) were more likely than white participants to have a TGD knowledgeablePCP. Military service (OR 0.83, p = 0.013) was associated with reduced odds of TGD PCPknowledge, while age (OR 1.01, p < 0.001) and overall health (OR 1.38, p < 0.001) wereassociated with increased odds. Those in congregate housing were also more likely thanthose in personal, non-congregate housing to have a TGD knowledgeable PCP (OR 1.85,p = 0.011). Notably, the only form of insurance that was significantly different from noinsurance was military insurance (OR 0.56, p < 0.001), which was significantly associatedwith reduced PCP TGD health knowledge. Additionally, neither education nor incomewere significant in this model.4. DiscussionWe can see some interesting trends across healthcare experiences with doctors andPCPs when we look at all three regressions side by side. All genders were less likely tohave seen a doctor in the past year compared to men, and similarly, all genders (excepttrans men) were less likely to have a PCP than men. This trend changed slightly when itcomes to having a trans knowledgeable PCP; trans women were more likely to have onethan trans men, while nonbinary participants and cross dressers were less likely. Othergenders were not significant in this analysis. This confirms previous findings that there aregender differences in healthcare experiences within the TGD population [51], and theseneed to be explored more fully to understand unique experiences and needs across variousgenders when it comes to TGD healthcare.When looking at sexual orientation, asexual/demisexual and pansexual individualswere less likely to have visited a doctor in the past year than straight individuals. While forhaving a PCP, only those with additional orientations had a significant finding, which wasagain less likely than straight individuals to have a PCP. Interestingly, regarding havinga trans knowledgeable PCP, queer respondents were actually more likely to have onethan straight respondents, while bisexual, lesbian, pansexual, and those with additionalorientations were significantly less likely. There is very little research on the experience ofInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 13057 10 of 14TGD individuals who are also queer, lesbian, bisexual, and pansexual; much of the extantliterature focuses on straight TGD individuals and gay TGD individuals. More researchis needed to explore these within group differences, and more education is needed forproviders to understand that the TGD population is not a monolithic group, and that theyshould be aware of not only being inclusive to gender minorities, but sexual minoritiesas well.In looking at race and ethnicity, those who were biracial/multiracial, Latino/a/Hispanic,and who had additional racial/ethnic identities were less likely to have visited a doctor inthe past year than their white counterparts. On the other hand, Asian/Asian Americanand Black/African participants were more likely than white respondents to have a transknowledgeable PCP. Race and ethnicity were not significant for having a PCP in general.Future research is needed specifically with these sub-populations of TGD individuals tobetter understand their experiences, barriers, and facilitators not only to healthcare ingeneral, but also to trans knowledgeable PCPs.Perhaps not surprisingly, those experiencing insecure housing were less likely to havevisited a doctor in the past year than those who had personal housing. Less expected wasthat respondents who lived in congregate housing settings were significantly more likelyto have a trans knowledgeable PCP. Future research should consider exploring differenttypes of congregant care settings to better understand these findings. Housing was notsignificant regarding having a PCP. Religious individuals were more likely both to havevisited a doctor in the past year as well as have a PCP than those who reported not beingreligious, but there were no significant findings about having a trans knowledgeable PCP.Education was significant regarding having visited a doctor in the past year, with alleducational experiences (other than a high school diploma/GED and an associate’s degree)being connected to being more likely to have seen a doctor in the past year. Interestingly,there was no significance across education experiences for having a PCP or having a transknowledgeable PCP. It was also interesting that an income of $50,000 and higher indicateda higher likelihood of having seen a doctor in the past year and having a PCP, compared tothose with no income, while income was not significant for having a trans knowledgeablePCP. This is particularly of interest, as simply having some income does not change thelikelihood of visiting the doctor or having a PCP, but rather, income needs to be $50,000a year or higher to increase the likelihood. It also showcases that while income maymake it easier for TGD individuals to have a PCP and go to the doctor, a lack of transknowledgeable providers cuts across class status.Those with a military history were significantly more likely to have seen a doctor in thepast year and have a PCP as compared to those with no military history, and were also lesslikely to have a trans knowledgeable PCP. Given many documented issues of challengesfaced by TGD veterans in the VA system [46,47], this is in line with extant research, andindicates a need for better training for military connected healthcare providers, especiallyas most active service members and veterans do not have the option (whether financially,location wise, etc.) to seek more knowledgeable and/or affirming providers elsewhere.With every year of increase in age, there was a significant increase in likelihoodacross all three outcome variables, likely because as people age, they have access tomore resources (both fiscal and community based), as well as may have received moremessaging about the importance of regular doctor visits and having a PCP. Given thatolder individuals are also more likely to have a trans knowledgeable PCP, this could be anopportunity for programs that create intergenerational spaces in TGD communities, where“trans elders” (this term is often used to refer to TGD individuals aged 50+ [51]) couldshare their experiences in healthcare systems with younger TGD individuals, helping toconnect them to knowledgeable providers. However, it is also possible that older TGDindividuals may have a different definition of what it means to be trans knowledgeablethan younger individuals. More research at the intersection of TGD identity and aging isneeded, particularly within the health and healthcare domain.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 13057 11 of 14Furthermore, not surprisingly, having better overall health was associated with havingseen a doctor in the past year, having a PCP, and additionally having a trans knowledgeablePCP. This is likely a bidirectional relationship; having a regular doctor who knows aboutyour body and its needs is more likely to lead to better overall health and having betteroverall health means that you have more capacity to find a PCP who is knowledgeableabout your healthcare needs, and you are likely to go see them more. It is important thatfuture research delves more deeply into this relationship, as it could be one of the keys toincreasing the overall health and regular healthcare visits of the TGD population.Having a disability resulted in being more likely to have seen a doctor in the past yearas well as having a PCP, which is not a surprise given the additional health needs of disabledindividuals. However, disability was not significantly related to having a trans knowledge-able PCP. Given that previous research has indicated disabled TGD individuals experiencehigher rates of anti-trans discrimination than their non-disabled counterparts [52], thisindicates a need for more training for all healthcare providers about both trans relatedhealthcare and being a PCP for those with disabilities, chronic illnesses, and other suchmedical conditions. Disabled TGD people should not have to choose between a transknowledgeable PCP and a disability aware PCP.In terms of having insurance, those participants with insurance were approximatelythree to five times more likely to have seen a doctor in the past year and approximatelysix to seven times more likely to have a PCP than their counterparts with no insurance.However, there was little in the way of significant findings regarding insurance and transknowledgeable PCPs; those with military insurance were half as likely to have a transknowledgeable PCP than those with no insurance, again affirming the need for more TGDaffirming policies and continuing education training for military and VA providers. Thesefindings also showcase that while there absolutely should be a push for TGD people to getaccess to being insured, as it will increase their likelihood of seeing a doctor and havinga PCP, insurance alone is not enough to be able to access a knowledgeable PCP. Insurancecompanies should ensure that their panels of providers include trans knowledgeable PCPsin additional to gender-affirming specialists, that there are an appropriate number of theseproviders (rather than only one or two for an entire area), and that their plans cover alltypes of gender-affirming care.Every primary care provider, regardless of location, urbanicity, size of practice, etc.,should be prepared for and knowledgeable about TGD related healthcare. Medical schoolsneed to integrate more of this into their curriculums, grand rounds need to cover thesetopics, and they should be a required component of ongoing medical education. Policiesneed to shift at the organization, local, state, and federal level to ensure that knowledge ofgender-affirming care and basic knowledge on prescribing for and treating TGD patientsis included not only as part of training in medical schools, but on an ongoing basis, aschange often happens both regarding TGD identities and the medications used to supportindividuals who have opted for a medical transition of any sort.Moreover, it is crucial that this education be intersectional across gender, race, sexualorientation, age, disability status, housing status, income, and educational achievement.TGD individuals deserve not only access to care, which has been noted in research through-out the past decade or two, but specifically care that is knowledgeable about their identities,experiences, and needs that may be specific to their TGD status. Using an intersectionalapproach that understands culturally responsive care must take into account all of theidentities and experiences of TGD clients, rather than asking them to choose their mostsalient identity when attempting to access care. Anything less than this is a failure ofmedicine for the TGD population and a violation of the Hippocratic oath.LimitationsThere are, however, a few limitations to note. The study used cross-sectional surveydata, precluding any claims of directionality of correlations. Findings are limited toa snapshot in time of when the survey was taken. Furthermore, as with any secondary dataInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 13057 12 of 14analysis, the researchers did not have direct input on survey questions, and it is possiblethat some variables could have been more appropriately measured. For example, theUSTS did not include a universal question asking all participants whether they had a PCP.Rather, the survey asked participants different questions about who they sought theirprimary care from (i.e., routine health provider or trans-related health provider). Thesequestions were combined into an overall measure of whether participants had a PCP, but itis possible that participants may have interpreted these individual questions differently,potentially impacting responses. Additionally, although the sample was large, it was notrepresentative, limiting some of its generalizability. Specifically, the sample was younger,more educated, and had more white people than the US TGD population is believed tohave [53]. To ameliorate this limitation, weighting was used to adjust the sample to bemore in line with the larger TGD population. Using the weighted data helped to adjust forsome of these issues, but this continues to be a challenge with many of the larger samplesof TGD individuals. Until gender is included in a more robust way on the U.S. Census andevery state’s health survey, it is impossible to assess how representative these samples are.5. ConclusionsTGD individuals often face health and healthcare challenges, whether from issuesrelated to lack of access to basic health or discrimination in medical settings. Many mayhave trouble finding a trans knowledgeable provider to be their PCP. This study exploredhow different sociodemographic identities and their experiences may increase or decreaseTGD individuals’ trips to the doctor, having a PCP, and having a trans knowledgeable PCP.Providers of all types, but especially those who offer primary care, should be educated onand prepared to support the needs of the TGD population, and we as a society need to doa better job in creating policies, offering training, and disrupting systems of oppression inorder to better serve this marginalized population.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, S.K.K. and K.L.S.; methodology, S.K.K., J.C. and L.K.;formal analysis, J.C. and L.K.; data curation, S.K.K.; writing—original draft preparation, S.K.K., J.C.,B.T.H., L.K. and K.L.S.; writing—review and editing, S.K.K., J.C., B.T.H., L.K. and K.L.S.

    "abstract": "Transgender and gender diverse individuals face a variety of barriers when attempting to access healthcare, from discrimination to lack of access to lack of knowledgeable providers. Using data from the 2015 United States Trans Survey (N = 27,715), this study looks at the differences within the TGD population regarding having seen a doctor in the past year, having a primary care provider, and having a primary care provider who is knowledgeable about trans health. Logistic regressions indicate that even within an all transgender and gender diverse sample, a variety of identities and experiences are related to increased or decreased likelihood of each of these outcomes, with significant differences across gender, race/ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, disability status, educational attainment, annual income, disability status, religiosity, military status, overall health, housing status, and insurance coverage. Not only should there be an effort to support transgender and gender diverse individuals in accessing care, but there is a clearly indicated need for additional education for healthcare providers, especially those doing primary care, on how to offer knowledgeable, affirming, and intersectional care to their patients",
