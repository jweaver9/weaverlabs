One potential explanation for this discrepancy in the sexual prejudice literature is that explicit prejudice is being measured in a manner that is no longer culturally relevant, as proposed by Morrison and Morrison (2003) in the development of their Modern Homonegativity Scale. Modern homonegativity (MH) is characterized by negative attitudes toward behaviours and policies that benefit LGBTQ people, rather than a negative attitude toward homosexuality itself. The present work aimed to further the field’s understanding of MH and the role it plays in the formation of attitudes toward others. In Study 1, participants read one of three character profiles, each describing a gay man who volunteered with a particular group: an LGBTQ activism group, an environmental activism group, or a local library. Participants rated the target higher on negative trait descriptors when he was an LGBTQ activist. Study 2, a replication and extension of this work that included straight and female targets, showed a more complicated interaction of participant gender, target gender, target orientation, and target activism. A brief third study assessed which trait descriptors were most commonly applied to volunteers in order to ensure the validity of the outcome variables. Study 4 extended Studies 1 and 2 with the inclusion of MH as a predictor and with a behavioural measure added to the survey. The data from Study 4 suggested that MH contributes to the formation of negative attitudes across conditions, but that it also interacts with both activism condition and orientation to create negative attitudes. This supports the idea that although MH does interact with behavioural information to produce negative attitudes, it also interacts with orientation to produce less favourable attitudes toward gay targets even when activism is held constant. Implications for further work on MH and sexual prejudice in general are discussed.  Keywords: modern homonegativity; sexual prejudice; LGBTQ; attitudes; prejudice; discrimination iii  Lay Summary  Although prejudice toward the LGBTQ community appears to be decreasing over time, many LGBTQ individuals continue to report being the target of prejudice and discrimination. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the tools we are using to measure prejudice toward the LGBTQ community are no longer relevant or sensitive enough to pick up on new and subtle forms of prejudice. A new scale, called the Modern Homonegativity Scale (MHS), was built to address this issue and published in 2003 by Morrison and Morrison. This scale asks people about their thoughts and feelings toward LGBTQ-friendly policies and behaviours, rather than their thoughts and feeling toward LGBTQ individuals themselves. The current work aimed to test whether people who score high on the MHS only feel negatively toward those policies and behaviours, or whether identity still plays a role in their attitudes toward others. Across four studies, participants were exposed to profiles of fictional characters who were identified as either gay or straight, and who volunteered for either an LGBTQ activism group, an environmental activism group, or a local library. They were then asked to rate their attitude toward those individuals and sometimes to donate money to their cause. Results indicated that people who score high on the MHS actually used both identity information (straight vs. gay) as well as behavioural information (activism type) when forming their attitudes toward the fictional characters. This holds a host of implications for future research on modern homonegativity and prejudice in general.   iv  Acknowledgements  There are many people I need to thank for helping me finish this degree, so here goes:  First, thank you to my supervisor Dr. Lorne Campbell, and all of the faculty members who served on my various dissertation committees: Dr. Rachel Calogero, Dr. William Fisher, Dr. Samantha Joel, Dr. Erin Heerey, Dr. Irene Cheung, and Dr. B.J.

attitudinal trends have reported increased tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality and less willingness to restrict the civil liberties of sexual minorities in North America (e.g., Altemeyer, 2001; Hicks & Lee, 2006; McCormack, 2011). The LGBTQ community achieved a landmark in civil rights in July 2015 when the United States Supreme Court ruled in favour of national marriage equality (Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015). A recent ruling for marriage equality by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has also set a precedent for 19 countries in North and South America, which have agreed to abide by the court’s decision; same-sex marriages are now legally binding in Mexico, El Salvador, and Costa Rica, among many others (Lavers, 2018). Overall, this paints a rather positive picture of contemporary LGBTQ acceptance.  However, the majority of sexual minorities continue to report experiences of harassment, offensive speech, and even violence due to their sexual orientation (e.g. Christman, 2012; Kosciw, Greytak, Diaz & Bartkiewicz, 2010; Katz-Wise & Hyde, 2012). A recent report by the LGBTQ media organization GLAAD noted that acceptance of LGBTQ people is decreasing while discrimination is increasing in the United States (Ellis, 2018). Homicides against members of the LGBTQ community have also surged since 2007 (Wile, 2016). This is not exclusive to the United States; in 2019, for example, serial killer Bruce McArthur was charged with the murder of eight men, most of whom had ties to Toronto’s Gay Village neighbourhood (Levinson-King, 2019).  One possible explanation for this discrepancy in reported and experienced rates of prejudice and discrimination lies in the theory of modern homonegativity (Morrison & Morrison, 2003). This theory proposes a conceptual distinction between old-fashioned homonegativity, which is grounded in religious or moral objections to homosexuality, and modern homonegativity, which is based on more subtle objections to behaviours enacted by LGBTQ individuals (such as drawing attention to one’s 2  sexuality or demanding further civil rights). Most polls of attitudes toward sexual minorities measure something akin to old-fashioned homonegativity; so while attitudes appear to be improving toward LGBTQ individuals, perhaps it is only old-fashioned homonegativity that is decreasing in popularity, and not modern homonegativity. This could explain why so many sexual minorities continue to report experiences of prejudice and discrimination, while few people report actually being prejudiced and discriminatory toward members of this community.  The present work explores this possibility and its implications for attitudes and behaviour toward sexual minorities. An overview of recent research on prejudice and discrimination toward sexual minorities will be presented, and several studies will examine attitudes toward gay-identified fictional characters as a function of their behaviour. Implications for future research will be discussed. 1.1 Prejudice and Discrimination Psychologist George Weinberg was the first to use the term “homophobia” in 1972. He defined this term as “the dread of being in close quarters with homosexuals – and in the case of homosexuals themselves, self-loathing.” (Weinberg, 1972, pp. 4). Whether negative feelings toward homosexuals are accurately characterized as phobic, or fearful, has been a subject of much debate. Recent work has suggested that anger and disgust are probably more typical in this area than fear (e.g. Giner-Sorolla, Bosson, Caswell, & Hettinger, 2012; Parrott, Peterson, Vincent, & Bakeman, 2008). For this reason, rather than homophobia, most researchers now refer to a negative evaluation response toward LGBTQ individuals as a prejudice rather than a phobia (Herek & McLemore, 2013). This may be referred to as sexual prejudice, antigay prejudice, or homonegativity; these terms are essentially interchangeable. 3  Prejudice is typically conceptualized as having both cognitive and affective components, as well as a conative component, meaning a predisposition to behave negatively toward members of a particular group (Dovidio, Hewstone, Glick, & Esses, 2010). Discrimination, on the other hand, describes actual behaviour: “… actively negative behavior toward a member of a group or, more subtly, less positive responses than those toward an ingroup member in comparable circumstances” (Dovidio et al., 2010, pp. 8-9). The distinction between prejudice and discrimination is important in our understanding of the topic at hand; although prejudiced attitudes often predict discriminatory behaviour (e.g. Dovidio, Brigham, Johnson, & Gaetner, 1996, as cited in Fiske, 1998; Stangor, Sullivan, & Ford, 1991), there is not a perfect correlation. As such, prejudice toward sexual minorities will be discussed separately from discrimination. 1.2 Prejudice Toward Sexual Minorities There are many different methods for measuring prejudice toward sexual minorities. Explicit prejudice is typically measured via self-report from the person who possesses that prejudice; that is, although these terms are perhaps better suited to behaviours, one asks the “perpetrator” rather than the “victim”. This method is perhaps the most straightforward for assessing prejudice, and it allows for rapid large-scale data collection, but it faces serious measurement challenges. Reported prejudice toward another group is, of course, subject to social desirability bias; further, respondents may not even be aware of their own prejudice (as in the case of implicit prejudice). Implicit prejudice, or prejudice that one is unaware of or unable to verbalize, is conceptually distinct from explicit prejudice and often differentially predicts behaviour (for an overview, see Maass, Castelli, & Arcuri, 2000). Implicit prejudice by definition must be assessed through tools other than self-report, such as the Affect Misattribution Procedure (Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005) or the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee & Schwartz, 1998; but see Payne, Vuletich, & Lundberg, 2017, for a discussion of issues 4  surrounding implicit attitude testing). The current work will touch on implicit prejudice at various points, but given its focus on modern homonegativity (an attitude measured via an explicit self-report scale), will cover explicit prejudice in greater detail. Generally, a minority of North American individuals report prejudice toward LGBTQ individuals, but this minority may still be quite large. GLAAD’s most recent Accelerating Acceptance report noted that in 2017, 36% of non-LGBTQ Americans indicated they would be somewhat uncomfortable or very uncomfortable with seeing a same-sex couple holding hands (Ellis, 2018; this number is up from 29% in 2016). Gallup poll data shows that, as of 2018, 31% of polled participants believed that same-sex married couples should not be recognized by law and given the same rights as different-sex married couples (Gallup, 2018). Further, 23% of polled participants felt that gay or lesbian relations between consenting adults should be illegal, and 30% felt that gay or lesbian relations were morally wrong. The 2014 poll, the most recent to measure this item, indicates that 35% of respondents felt that same-sex couples should not have the legal right to adopt a child. Indeed, other work has shown that attitudes toward same-sex adoption are still quite negative, particularly toward lesbian couples (Rye & Meaney, 2010a). Studies of specific helping professions have shown small but significant minorities with negative attitudes toward LGBTQ individuals; for instance, 14% of a sample of social work faculty showed sexual prejudice (Chonody, Woodford, Brennan, Newman, & Wang, 2014), and a small minority of Californian medical students expressed disgust in response to gay male behaviour (Matharu, Kravitz, McMahon, Wilson, & Fitzgerald, 2012). Sexual prejudice among these populations is particularly troubling, as it could potentially compromise care toward their patients.  On a more positive note, there is a great deal of work that suggests that prejudice is decreasing over time. Visibility of sexual minorities has certainly increased in recent decades: more gay characters 5  have been appearing on television (Hart, 2000), more sexual minorities have appeared in advertisements (Hester & Gibson, 2007), and an increasing number of celebrities are disclosing their sexual minority status (Valentine, Skelton & Butler, 2003). Millennial lesbian women also tend to self-identify at a younger age than either of the generations before them, and they engage in same-sex relationships and sexual acts at a younger age (Nosti, 2010). Further, the number of surveyed U.S. adults who had had at least one same-sex partner since age 18 doubled between the 1990s and the early 2010s, largely accounted for by an increase in bisexual behaviour (Twenge, Sherman, & Wells, 2016). Polling data seems to indicate a growing trend toward acceptance as well. Altemeyer (2001) found that between 1984 and 1998, every item on his “Attitudes Toward Homosexuals Scale” showed more accepting scores. Attitudes toward same-sex sexual behaviour has become more accepting, with 49% of American adults indicating this behaviour was “not wrong at all” (up from 11% in 1973 and 13% in 1990; Twenge et al., 2016). Of course, this leaves more than half of American adults still feeling that same-sex relationships are wrong on some level, but it certainly indicates progress. Support for same-sex marriage has increased significantly in the last two decades, with Gallup data (2015) indicating support from 27% of participants in 1996, and 60% of participants in 2015.  Ellis (2018) indicates that although comfort with and approval of same-sex couples may be decreasing, support for LGBTQ rights appears to be holding strong; 79% of non-LGBTQ Americans strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement “I support equal rights in the LGBT community.” This percentage has held steady since 2016, while many other indicators of support for sexual minorities have dropped during that time (Ellis, 2018).  Interestingly, support for LGBTQ rights seems to be especially pronounced in workplace or legal settings; even rural populations in politically “red” states show limited support for LGBTQ policies, especially ones that focus on housing and jobs rather than marriage or adopting children (Stange & 6  Kazyak, 2016). Support for gay men in professional capacities, such as giving a speech, teaching at a local college, or having a book in the local library, increased significantly between the 1970s and the 2010s (Twenge, Carter, & Campbell, 2015). The Pew Research Center, which has been tracking public support for granting school boards the right to fire teachers who are known to be homosexual, reports a marked decline in agreement with this policy (51.5% in 1987, compared to 21.0% in 2012; Becker, 2014). Other work has shown that, as early as 2003, 99% of polled participants thought that sexual minorities should have equal rights in terms of job opportunities (Hicks & Lee, 2006). 1.3 Discrimination Toward Sexual Minorities The bulk of the literature on prejudice is conducted with participants reporting on their own levels of prejudice. The discrimination literature is quite the inverse; a great majority of research studies in this area ask victims about their experiences of discrimination, rather than querying the perpetrators of discrimination. This is likely due to concerns about social desirability, which might skew participants responses toward a more accepting or tolerant view. Sexual minorities are also able to report on incidences of discrimination without any necessity for “mind-reading”, which makes their perspective perhaps more objective here than in assessments of prejudice.  The literature on sexual prejudice sounds rather promising for those invested in the safety and well-being of sexual minorities. Although some prejudice still exists, it seems that its rates are dwindling, and only a small minority of individuals seem to endorse formal discrimination against sexual minorities (for example, job discrimination). However, the discrimination literature suggests that LGBTQ individuals are still the target of many discriminatory behaviours. The GLAAD Accelerating Acceptance report notes that 55% of surveyed LGBTQ individuals reported experiencing discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity in 2017. This number has gone up from 44% in 2016, indicating that levels of discrimination are certainly not diminishing (Ellis, 2018). This aligns well with a 2014 study indicating 7  that 50% of gay men and 54% of lesbians had experienced discrimination in the past twelve months (Bostwick, Boyd, Hughes, West & McCabe, 2014). In a study comparing various generations of gay women, Nosti (2010) noted that discrimination based on sexuality was reported by 60.0% of “Baby Boomers”, 38.8% of the women in “Generation X”, and 38.6% of “Millennials” (the youngest generation in the sample). Millennials in this study did not indicate more perceived familial or social support than women of other generations. Sexual minority women also continue to report harassment from various areas of their lives, including from families, communities, churches, and schools (Pendragon, 2010). In Canada, Morrison (2011) noted that 75.7% of gay men and 83.9% of lesbians had been verbally insulted due to their sexual orientation over the course of their lifetime, and 55.8% of gay men and 63.9% of lesbians had been insulted just in the previous twelve months. In a meta-analysis of 256 studies and over 500,000 participants, Katz-Wise and Hyde (2012) determined that 55% of sexual minorities had reported experiences of harassment, and 41% had reported experiences of discrimination. Further, reports of several forms of victimization increased over time, including sexual assault from family, school victimization, and relational victimization.  In the workplace, LGBTQ individuals report a host of discriminatory behaviours. First, sexual minorities may have a difficult time attaining a job in the first place. Hebl, Foster, Mannix and Dovidio (2002) studied the effect of gay identity (manipulated through the use of the subject’s apparel; subjects wore either a “Gay and Proud” hat or a “Texan and Proud” hat when pretending to apply for jobs) on subjects’ employment prospects. Although they found no evidence of formal discrimination, they did find that subjects in the “Gay and Proud” condition experienced informal or interpersonal discrimination; fewer words were spoken to them, and their interaction with the potential employer was shorter in length. The subjects, who were blind to their own condition, also perceived the employer to be more negative in the “Gay and Proud” condition. Further work has also identified that identifying as homosexual was more damaging to candidates’ job prospects than identifying themselves as Black or 8  female (Crow, Fok & Hartman, 2008). Candidates identified as Black and homosexual were even less likely to be hired than White homosexuals, highlighting the interaction of stigmas related to race and sexual orientation. A recent large-scale study, which sent pairs of fictional resumes in response to over 1500 jobs postings across seven U.S., found that candidates who identified having experience in a gay campus organization were discriminated against in some states (but not others; Tilcsik, 2011). However, a California-based study using a student sample showed no hiring preference for candidates who were implied to be straight over those implied to be gay (Nguyen, 2012). Taken together, this literature seems to indicate that there are substantial regional differences (and likely generational differences) in discriminatory behaviour. Discrimination does not end with the hiring process. Badgett, Lau, Sears and Ho (2007) found that 16-68% of LGBTQ individuals reported experiences of workplace harassment. Past studies have shown that anywhere from 13-62% of sexual minorities believe they have faced discrimination in the workplace (Badgett, 1996). This stigma may even become ingrained in LGBTQ individuals; some work has noted negativity from sexual minorities themselves toward harmless behaviours such as announcing one’s sexuality or “flaunting it”, with respondents indicating that behaviours like this would make them vulnerable to danger and harassment (Williams, Giuffre & Dellinger, 2009). An interesting phenomenon occurs with the wages of sexual minorities. Gay and bisexual men reliably make less money than their straight counterparts, with this pattern of results being replicated in Canada (Carpenter, 2008), the United States (Clain & Leppel, 2001), the United Kingdom (Aksoy, Carpenter & Frank, 2016), France (Laurent & Mihoubi, 2012), and elsewhere. Gay men appear to earn roughly 10-32% less than equally qualified heterosexual men (Badgett et al., 2007). Interestingly, however, lesbian women do not appear to suffer from this “gay penalty”; in some cases, researchers have even observed a “lesbian advantage”, wherein lesbian women make more money than their heterosexual female counterparts (e.g. Carpenter, 2008). This may be due, at least in part, to the fact 9  that lesbian women are significantly less likely to have young children present in the household (3% of lesbians versus 19.1% of heterosexual women in a Canadian study; Carpenter, 2008). Although gay men are similarly less likely than straight men to have young children present in their household, women have historically seen a drop in wages when they have children, while men have not (for a review, see Waldfogel, 1998).  At school, Christman (2012) found that gay men described high levels of homonegative victimization from professors, teachers, and peers alike. School-based studies in the United States have shown that the majority of LGBTQ youth still report experiences of relationship aggression, verbal harassment, physical assault, and homophobic remarks (e.g. Kosciw, Greytak, Diaz & Bartkiewicz, 2010). The same study noted that nearly two-thirds of the participants had heard homophobic comments from school personnel, indicating that this problem is not only present in youth or children. Discouragingly, public school districts in the U.S. have also been notoriously unreliable in addressing the needs of sexual minority students via anti-bullying or pro-LGBTQ policies and programs (Rienzo, Button, Sheu & Li, 2006). Sexual minorities are also the targets of violence and crime. Roughly 40% of gay men, and 12-13% of lesbians, have described being the target of violence or property crime due to their orientation (University of California-Davis News and Information, as cited in Sue, 2010). Hate crimes against LGB individuals were increasing in frequency in the mid-2000s (Hansen-Weaver, 2009), and homicides with LGBTQ targets have increased since 2007 (Wile, 2016). More subtly, LGBTQ individuals are also given less help than others when they need it. Hendren and Blank (2009) noted that gay confederates (identified with a “Gay Pride” T-shirt) were less likely to receive help when approaching participants in a parking lot to ask for a 10-pence piece. Male participants were especially less likely to help confederates in the “Gay Pride” condition. This is in line 10  with previous work indicating that less help was given to gay male callers in a “wrong number” paradigm (Shaw, Borough & Fink, 1994); this finding was later replicated and extended to include lesbians and heterosexual women (Gore, Tobiasen & Kayson, 1997). In a relatively rare study examining rates of reported discrimination among perpetrators, 43% of participants in a Canadian undergraduate sample admitted to yelling insulting comments at gay men; 14% admitted to playing jokes on gay men; 43% admitted to telling an antigay joke, and 32% reported spreading negative talk about gay men (Jewell & Morrison, 2010). 1.4 The Impact of Prejudice and Discrimination Experiences of prejudice and discrimination are clearly linked to negative outcomes. LGBTQ individuals suffering from social stigma are more vulnerable to alienation from their family and friends, and the experience of discrimination contributes significantly to the loneliness felt by older LGBTQ individuals (Coleman & Remafedi, 1982; Kuyper & Fokkema, 2009). Exposure to blatant prejudice has also been associated with distancing from one’s in-group among sexual minorities, likely leading to further isolation (Krolikowski, 2011). Qualitative studies have also notes feelings of isolation and invisibility among sexual minorities (e.g. Jewell, McCutcheon, Harriman, & Morrison, 2012). Further, minority stress has been linked to lower satisfaction in romantic relationships, potentially causing more isolation and loneliness (Guschlbauer, 2014). Sexual minorities may also be less likely to pursue higher education. Recent work has shown that LGB women, compared to LGB men and heterosexual men and women, were the least likely group to have finished a bachelor’s degree (Fine, 2012). However, this is likely a situation wherein gender and sexuality interact, as in this study, LGB men were actually the most likely to have received a degree. Canadian research has demonstrated that when university campus environments are perceived as 11  uncomfortable or unaccepting, sexual and gender minorities individuals (students, staff and faculty) were three times more likely to seriously consider leaving their university (Tate, 2014).  On a legal level, jurors are more likely to convict a defendant accused of sexually abusing a young boy when the defendant is identified as gay, rather than straight (Wiley & Bottoms, 2009). This of course has many serious implications for our judicial system. There are many mental health correlates of experiences of discrimination as well. Szymanski (2009) and Guschlbauer (2014) note that sexual minorities may suffer particular psychological distress as a result of harassment, rejection, and discrimination based on their sexual orientation. LGBTQ individuals suffering from social stigma are vulnerable to depression and impaired psychological development (Coleman & Remafedi, 1982; Pascoe & Richman, 2009). Structural stigma has also been shown to predict alcohol and tobacco use, as well as the use of other substances (Guschlbauer, 2014; Pachankis, Hatzenbuehler, & Starks, 2014). Victimization at school has been found to predict lower levels of self-esteem and higher levels of depression and anxiety (Ellis, 2012).  Finally, sexual stigma and minority stress has also been linked to physical ailments and mortality. Pascoe and Richman (2009) note that experiences of discrimination are predictive of cardiovascular disease factors. Past work has also shown that LGBTQ individuals living in communities with high levels of anti-gay prejudice are at a greater risk of mortality than those living in low-prejudice communities, due in part to increased rates of suicide, homicide, and cardiovascular disease among LGBTQ individuals in high-prejudice communities (Hatzenbuehler, Bellatorre, Lee, Finch, Muennig & Fiscella, 2014). In a 2005 study, roughly one third of sampled LGB youth had attempted suicide, and about half of those attempts were identified as being directly related to their sexual orientation (d’Augelli et al., 2005). Adolescents’ perceived heterosexism has been negatively associated with adolescent adjustment (Vyncke, Julien, Jouvin, & Jodoin, 2014), and a lack of acceptance at school has been linked with suicide 12  attempts in LGBTQ youth (Plöderl, Faistauer, & Fartacek, 2010). A Brazilian study also noted that the experience of sexual stigma resulted in a 60% increase in suicide attempts among youth (Costa, Pasley, Machado, Alvarado, Dutra-Thomé, & Koller, 2017). The same study found that experienced sexual stigma was also related to an increase rate of reported community and familial physical assault, molestation, and rape – indicating that stigma may be related to victimization on multiple fronts. 1.5 Explaining the Discrepancy    This literature presents an interesting conundrum. Most research on prejudice indicates that self-reported rates of sexual prejudice are dropping, but sexual minorities continue to report frequent discrimination and harassment. Where is this discrepancy coming from? Several possibilities will be discussed here.  First, I will note what seems to be the most obvious explanation: that although prejudice is declining, it still exists, and a small but active minority of the population could still be perpetrating a large number of discriminatory behaviours. This is a compelling notion, but it seems unlikely to be a full explanation for this discrepancy. Recent work has noted that sexual minorities perceive anti-gay prejudice to be ubiquitous, or present in every aspect of their lives (Jewell et al., 2012). Further, if this minority were fully accountable for all discriminatory practices, one would expect that workplace settings (where, as noted previously, a very small percentage endorse discriminatory behaviours – as low as 1% in some work) would show particularly low incidences of prejudice. Based on the research surveyed above, this does not seem to be the case. Sampling bias in prejudice research could certainly also be an issue. Western research is dominated by the use of convenience samples, which tend to include young, educated, liberal college students; many of these factors have been linked to sexual prejudice in the past (e.g. Hicks & Lee, 2006). Prejudice tends to be self-reported, so a biased convenience sample would substantially affect research 13  outcomes. Studies on discrimination, conversely, tend to sample from a population of victims; as such, they are sampling discrimination from a much wider host of individuals (i.e., everyone the victim/participant encounters in their daily life). Perhaps the discrepancy we are seeing is simply a result of this fact; that the discrimination literature, by virtue of its most widely used methods, assesses the behaviour of a wider slice of the human population. However, even nationally representative samples in prejudice research tend to show positive trends toward acceptance (e.g. Loftus, 2001), so this cannot be a full explanation for this discrepancy.  This difference in populations between the two literatures opens up a host of further problems in comparing the two. First, it is possible that social desirability bias is influencing prejudice studies, with participants not wanting to admit their anti-gay attitudes. Morrison and Morrison (2003) suggest this possibility, but note that empirical studies of social desirability influence have not provided much evidence for this idea (e.g. Herek, 1988).  Second, it is plausible that these two populations simply have different ideas about what constitutes discrimination. The newly emerging topic of microaggressions may be key in understanding this difference. Microaggressions are subtle, often unconscious behaviours that convey hostility toward members of stigmatized groups (Sue et al., 2007). They may include verbal comments, gestures, or a host of other behaviours, some as subtle as staring a moment too long or quietly excluding someone from a group. Although microaggressions may not necessarily involve the intent to harm, in contradiction with the classical definition of aggression (e.g. Baron & Richardson, 1994), harm may occur regardless. Targets of microaggressive behaviours may interpret these behaviours as communicating serious themes of sexual objectification, estrangement, or abnormality. Microaggressions are frequently reported by sexual minorities; for example, Christman (2012) reported that nearly all participants indicated they had experienced indirect prejudice in the form of stereotyping or assumptions of heterosexuality.  14  Recent work suggests that sexual minorities perceive imagined microaggressive scenarios differently than heterosexuals, rating subtle behaviours as being more negative, more impactful, and more discriminatory than do their heterosexual peers (Moroz & Campbell, 2018); the same work suggests that sexual minorities may be motivated to perceive discrimination at a lower threshold than heterosexual individuals do, as a means of protecting themselves from harm. If this is the case, it could certainly result in discrepancies between reports on the frequency of discrimination and prejudice.  A recent qualitative study of antigay behaviour also noted that perpetrators tended to believe that antigay jokes, a classic microaggressive behaviour, were meaningless and completely harmless; in fact, the perpetrators considered them to be a common and acceptable form of conduct (Jewell & Morrison, 2010). It is possible, then, that part of the discrepancy in the prejudice and discrimination literatures comes from the fact that sexual minorities are reporting discrimination that heterosexuals do not even understand they are perpetrating. This is a difficult knot to untangle, and much further work is needed to better understand the role that microaggressions may play here. However, microaggressions cannot possibly constitute a full explanation for this discrepancy, as much of the discrimination reported by sexual minorities includes undoubtedly conscious and intentional behaviours, such as property damage, violence, and harassment.  Another issue is the value of explicit prejudice as a predictor of discrimination. Implicit and explicit bias are separate constructs which must be measured differently, and which may differentially predict discriminatory behaviour. It is plausible that, while explicit prejudice is decreasing (as this is what is measured by nearly all of the large-scale studies noted above), implicit prejudice is holding steady, and this continues to drive discriminatory behaviour. However, explicit and implicit sexual prejudice have shown a moderate correlation of r = .229-.291 in the past (Hofshi, 2017), so it seems unlikely that implicit bias would maintain high levels over time while explicit prejudice is decreasing. It is possible that 15  the link between explicit and implicit prejudice is diminishing over time, especially given changing social norms, although I am not aware of any work that speaks to this hypothesis.  It is also possible that explicit prejudice is simply not a good predictor of discriminatory behaviour. Several recent studies have called this connection into question. Crosby and Wilson (2015) found that, when asked to imagine witnessing a homophobic slur, nearly 50% of participants said that they would confront the perpetrator; however, when participants actually did witness a confederate using a homophobic slur, not a single one spoke up. A recent study of disgust reactions (measured via levels of salivary α-amylase, a marker for disgust and stress), found similarly high levels of disgust when viewing pictures of same-sex men kissing across all participants, regardless of their explicit level of prejudice (O’Handley, Blair, & Hoskin, 2017). Even implicit sexual prejudice has been identified as a poor predictor of discriminatory behaviour relative to affective reactions such as facial expressions (e.g. Morrison, Trinder & Morrison, 2018).  It seems unlikely, however, that attitudes would show no correlation whatsoever with behaviour. Classic social psychological research indicates that, although global attitudes are not good predictors of specific behaviours, they are correlated with general patterns of behaviour across time and situations (e.g. Ajzen, 1989; Azjen & Fishbien, 1980); and more recent work has certainly correlated sexual prejudice with discrimination. Negative feelings toward sexual minorities have been linked to self-reported homonegative behaviour, including avoidance of and aggression toward gay individuals (Patel, Long, McCammon & Wuensch, 1995). Franklin (2000) also found that antigay ideology was strongly predictive of antigay actions in young adults. This brings us to a final possibility, which is that although explicit prejudice may be valuable in predicting behaviour, the field is not doing a good job of measuring culturally relevant explicit prejudice at this point in time. Morrison and Morrison (2003) suggested that existing heterosexism measures at 16  the time were not fully capturing attitudes toward gay individuals; that even if anti-gay sentiments were still prevalent, they were escaping notice due to the ineffectiveness of existing measurement tools. This led to their development of the Modern Homonegativity Scale. 1.6 Modern Homonegativity  Morrison and Morrison proposed a new version of negativity toward homosexual individuals, termed “modern homonegativity”. Old-fashioned homonegativity, rooted in religious or moral objections to homosexuality, has been the focus of most large-scale polls, and has clearly been declining in recent years; however, more abstract concerns about sexual minorities may be holding steady. Morrison and Morrison suggested three such concerns as pillars of modern homonegativity: 1. That gay men and lesbians are making illegitimate or unnecessary demands for changes to the status quo; 2. That discrimination against homosexual men and women is a thing of the past; 3. That gay men and lesbians exaggerate the importance of their sexual preference, and in so doing, prevent themselves from assimilating into mainstream culture. Morrison and Morrison then constructed a scale based upon these ideas, called the Modern Homonegativity Scale (MHS). The MHS contains such items as “Many gay men use their sexual orientation so that they can obtain special privileges” and “Gay men should stop shoving their lifestyle down other people’s throats” (Morrison & Morrison, 2003). The authors reported that this scale is less susceptible to floor effects than measures of old-fashioned homonegativity. Past work has found support for the idea that the MHS, although strongly correlated with measures of old-fashioned homonegativity (e.g. Rye & Meaney, 2010b) is factorially distinct from those measures (e.g., Górska, Bilewicz, Winiewski, & Waszkiewicz, 2016; Morrison, Morrison, & Franklin, 2009; 17  Morrison, Kenny, & Harrington, 2005; Rodríguez-Castro, Lameiras-Fernández, Carrera-Fernández, & Vallejo-Medina, 2013), or that it is a separate dimension of antigay prejudice (Adolfsen, Iedema & Keuzenkamp, 2010). Others have questioned this claim, particularly Lottes and Grollman (2010), who report that their factor analyses did not support the distinctiveness of two different homonegativity domains. Further, they noted, only 16% of their university sample endorsed modern homonegativity to a greater degree than old-fashioned homonegativity. It is worth noting, however, that Lottes and Grollman significantly altered or replaced a number of items on the MHS, to the point where claims regarding the original MHS seem questionable. Gavlas (2018) also found that, although the MHS was highly reliable, its items did not load onto different factors than a traditional measure of antigay prejudice in a Southern U.S. sample, indicating that regional differences may be important in the functionality of the scale.  Much of the existing work on the MHS has focused on validating the scale and determining correlates or predictors of modern homonegativity. In their original paper, Morrison and Morrison (2003) reported that the scale correlated with political conservatism, religious behaviour, religious self-schema and modern sexism, but not social desirability bias. Further work has since linked the MHS with neoracism, neosexism, humanitarianism-egalitarianism, and the Protestant work ethic (Morrison & Morrison, 2011); old-fashioned racism, modern racism, patriotism, nationalism, religious fundamentalism, social dominance orientation, and perceived political conservatism (in an Irish sample; Morrison et al., 2005); acceptance of structural violence (Eldridge & Johnson, 2011); exposure to gay male characters in television shows (Sink & Mastro, 2017); and church attendance, being a member of the Republican political party, not having a gay or lesbian friend, not having participated in training about sexual identities in the past 12 months, and being older (among counselors; Satcher & Schumacker, 2009). Men score consistently higher on the MHS than women (Buechel & Hegarty, 2007; McDermott & Blair, 2012; Meaney & Rye, 2010; Rodríguez-Castro et al., 2013; Romero, Morera, & 18  Wiebe, 2015). Geographic location seems to be of some importance as well; in a test of American, Canadian, Irish and UK participants, McDermott and Blair (2012) noted that the American sample showed higher levels of modern homonegativity toward gay men than the Irish sample, and higher levels of modern homonegativity toward lesbian women than the Canadian sample. Scores on the MHS have been linked to a number of related attitudes. In one study, the MHS predicted disapproval of civil unions more strongly than traditional homonegativity (while traditional homonegativity was a better predictor of social distance; Górska et al., 2016). Men who score high on the MHS tend to be more confident in their ability to assess others’ sexuality (or “gaydar”), while actually having a higher bias rate; they are more likely to falsely believe other men are homosexual (Brewer & Lyons, 2017). MHS scores have also been shown to moderate the relationship between sexuality and judgements of leadership effectiveness – high MHS scorers tend to rate gay male leaders more negatively than heterosexual male leaders, while low MHS scorers show no such difference (Morton, 2017). Interestingly, exposure to subtle prejudice has been linked with an increase in prejudicial attitudes (whereas exposure to blatant prejudice usually leads to a reduction in prejudiced attitudes; Krolikowski, Rinella & Ratcliff, 2016). This suggests that modern homonegativity could actually be self-sustaining, as prejudice begets more prejudice. Behavioural work involving the MHS is relatively rare. Morrison and Morrison (2003) reported that high scorers on the MHS were less likely to sit near individuals wearing pro-gay T-shirts within an attributional ambiguity paradigm; further work has since demonstrated that high scorers on the MHS report being less likely to vote for a hypothetical gay mayoral candidate or aid in his campaign efforts (Morrison & Morrison, 2011). As noted previously, another study found that traditional homonegativity was actually a better predictor of social distance than modern homonegativity (Górska et al., 2016). Aside from this work, behavioural outcomes have not been linked to the MHS. 19  1.7 The Present Work This limited research on the MHS, and the concept of modern homonegativity, leaves us with a number of further questions. In this program of research, I will attempt to address some of the gaps in the existing literature, in order to better understand homonegativity as a whole. First, the MHS presents a fundamental question regarding the nature of prejudice. Is modern homonegativity, in fact, a completely distinct attitude from traditional homonegativity? The items on the MHS refer exclusively to behaviour or policy, rather than identity; perhaps negative feelings toward these behaviours and policies are distinct from negative feelings toward gay identities. Alternatively, are the more subtle (and perhaps more socially acceptable) statements on the MHS simply a “safer” way to express one’s existing traditional homonegativity? This has serious implications in the “real world”. Traditional homonegativity, or an objection to homosexuality itself, should manifest itself in prejudice and discrimination toward all gay individuals, regardless of their behaviour. Modern homonegativity, on the other hand, should present differently; it should be linked to a dislike of policies and programs that privilege or support sexual minorities, and a dislike for people (perhaps especially LGBTQ people) who endorse those policies and otherwise draw attention to their sexuality. Is this, in fact, what we would observe in the real world? This main research question led to the development of four studies designed to assess how individuals felt toward fictional characters who did or did not campaign for LGBTQ rights and policies. This work also investigates a number of potential moderators, including some previously correlated with the MHS (e.g. religiosity, racism, and social dominance orientation), as well as some previously untested in relation to the MHS (e.g. erotophilia/erotophobia). Four studies will be discussed in detail, as well as limitations of this work and directions for future research.  20  2 Study 1  Study 1 was designed to test a basic application of modern homonegativity: that a gay person who identifies as an LGBTQ advocate (i.e., someone who draws attention to their sexuality and advocates for further rights) should be more disliked, or liked less, than a gay person who does not do so. In this study, as well as in Study 2, the MHS itself was not administered, to avoid alerting participants to the purpose of the research. Several known correlates of the MHS were administered instead, and the work serves to identify attitudes toward these target individuals by a general student population.   2.1 Hypotheses  Several hypotheses were made for Study 1: 1. Participants in the LGBTQ+ activism condition would have more negative attitudes toward their target character than those in either the environmental or no activism conditions. 2. Participants in the LGBTQ+ activism condition would rate their target character as being higher on negative traits and lower on positive traits than those in either the environmental or no activism conditions. 3. The above effects could be moderated by a number of variables such as religiosity, religious participation, political orientation, patriotism, nationalism, social dominance orientation, neoracism, and traditional racism. In general, higher scores on these scales should interact with activism to produce more negative attitudes (with the exception of political orientation, as it was coded such that higher scores indicated more liberal political views).  21  2.2 Method 2.2.1 Study Preregistration  This study, along with all subsequent studies, was preregistered on the Open Science Framework. This registration is publicly available at https://osf.io/j8v49/ 2.2.2 Participants  301 undergraduate students were recruited from the university student subject pool, which grants students credit toward an introductory psychology course for participating in psychology studies. 24 participants identified themselves as being non-heterosexual or non-heteroromantic and were removed from the data set; although internalized homonegativity certainly exists, it is a different phenomenon from what was being studied here, and as such, this data was removed. The final sample comprised 192 women and 85 men for a sample size of 277. Participants ranged in age from 17 to 24 years (M=18.42, SD=0.96). 35.9% of the sample identified their ethnicity as White or Caucasian, 23.8% identified as Asian or East Asian, 11.4% identified as South Asian, 8.1% identified as Canadian, and 5.1% identified as European. The remaining 15.7% of participants identified as another ethnicity or as a mixed ethnicity.  The sample was relatively non-religious, with 37.8% of participants responding that they were not at all religious, 31.1% responding slightly religious, 24.4% responding somewhat religious, and 6.7% responding very religious. Church participation (measured using three items: frequency of prayer, church attendance, and study of religious texts) was also uncommon; on a scale from 1 (“Never”) to 5 (“Daily”), the mean of these three items was 1.93.  22  Participants were also more liberal than conservative, with 21.3% identifying themselves as liberal, 29.2% identifying as fairly liberal, 20.2% as fairly conservative, and only 6.9% as conservative. Notably, 22.4% of participants did not respond or responded “I don’t know” to this question. As participants were recruited from a student population, education levels were similar among most participants; 76.9% of participants reported their highest education level as a high school diploma, and 21.3% responded “some university”. Only 1.1% of participants reported that they had completed a Bachelor’s degree.  2.2.2 Materials and Procedure  Participants were brought into the lab in groups of up to six individuals and completed the study on a computer; although the questions were completed entirely online, previous knowledge of data quality from online studies using the student sample compelled us to bring participants into the lab. Participants first answered a battery of demographic questionnaires, including age, gender, racial background, sexual and romantic orientation, and level of education attained.  Participants then completed a number of measures known to correlate with modern homonegativity. Cronbach’s alpha values for the scales administered in this study are displayed for all multi-item measures on the diagonal in Table 1; all were within an acceptable range, being higher than 0.7. Participants responded to a religiosity item (Morrison et al., 2005), which asked them whether they perceived themselves to be very religious, somewhat religious, slightly religious, or not at all religious (including an “I don’t know” item). Participants also completed a brief scale assessing their level of religious activity or participation, which asked them to rate how often they attended a place of worship, how often they prayed, and how often they studied religious texts (with responses including never, occasionally, monthly, weekly, or daily; Loewenthal, MacLeod, & Cinnirella, 2001). This scale has shown 23  satisfactory reliability, construct validity, and criterion validity in previous work (Loewenthal et al., 2001). Political orientation was also measured using a single item, as in Morrison et al. (2005). Participants were asked if they perceived themselves to be conservative, fairly conservative, fairly liberal, or liberal (with an “I don’t know” option).  Participants then completed a patriotism scale, modified for a Canadian sample (Kosterman & Feshbach, 1989). They were asked to rate their agreement with a number of statements on a 7-point scale from 1 (“Strongly Disagree”) to 7 (“Strongly Agree”). Sample items include “I love my country”, “The fact that I am Canadian is an important part of my identity”, and “It is not that important for me to serve my country” (reverse coded). This scale has a reported reliability of α = .89. Kosterman and Feshbach’s nationalism scale was similarly adapted for this study; this scale uses the same format and includes items such as “Other countries should try to make their government as much like ours as possible” and “Generally, the more influence Canada has on other nations, the better off they are”. The scale has a reported reliability of α = .88. A social dominance orientation scale was also included. This scale, from Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth and Malle (1994), asks participants to indicate positive or negative feelings toward a number of statements (on a scale from 1, “Very negative”, to 7, “Very positive”). Sample items include “Some people are just more deserving than others”, “It is not a problem if some people have more of a chance in life than others”, and “In an ideal world, all nations would be equal”. Previous work has established an internal reliability of α = .83 and a test/retest correlation of r = .81. Finally, I measured both traditional racism and neoracism, both using scales from Tougas, Desruisseaux, Desrochers and de la Sablonnière (2004). Both scales ask participants to rate their agreement with a number of statements from 1 (“Not at all”) to 7 (“Absolutely”). The traditional racism scale includes seven items; previous work has established an internal reliability of α = .81 and a 24  test/retest correlation of r = .68. In this study is showed a reliability of α = .84. The neoracism scale, with 13 items, has a reported internal reliability of α = .84 and a test/retest reliability of r = .86. After progressing through these scales, participants were presented with a character profile, as follows: Michael is a 29-year-old human resources manager at a regional hospital. He is in a long-term relationship with his boyfriend, Eric, a nurse whom he met through work. The two live together in an apartment above a sporting good store. Michael himself is an active individual, playing on a recreational co-ed soccer team twice a week and jogging in his spare time. He enjoys cooking and hosts a dinner party for friends once a month. Michael also volunteers with a local LGBTQ activism group / a local environmental activism group / a local library, which often involves going door-to-door in the evenings, distributing information about upcoming events. His friends describe him as friendly, intelligent, outgoing, and honest, but sometimes selfish and impolite. Participants were presented with one of three profiles, which differed based on the bolded phrase. After reading this description, participants were asked to rate their overall attitude toward Michael on a sliding scale from 1-100. They were also asked to rate the degree to which they would apply various different traits to Michael, including three negative traits (obnoxious, intrusive, annoying) and three positive traits (pleasant, agreeable, considerate), on a scale from 1 (“Not at all”) to 5 (“Extremely”).   2.3 Results 2.3.1 Data Cleaning  There were no exclusion criteria for participating in this study, but as noted above, LGBTQ individuals were removed from the final data set. Specifically, this entailed removing any participant 25  who identified themselves as anything other than heterosexual and heteroromantic (sexual and romantic orientation were measured separately). This resulted in the removal of 24 participants. Notably, participants were not removed from the dataset based on their gender identity, so it is possible that some transgender (or genderqueer, genderfluid, etc.) individuals remained in the dataset so long as they identified as heterosexual and heteroromantic. A decision was made in advance to remove any participants who finished the study in less than four minutes, as this was deemed to be an impossibly small amount of time to read all of the questions and respond thoughtfully; however, no participants needed to be removed for this reason, as all took at least six minutes to finish the study. No outliers were removed from this dataset. 2.3.2 Data Analysis  2.3.2.1 Descriptive Statistics  Descriptive statistics for Study 1 are presented in Table 1. Note that here and throughout this paper, “Possible Range” is used to indicate the full range of possible responses, rather than the range of responses actually selected by participants.           26  Table 1.

These correlations cover all conditions, so one could interpret the “Attitude” variable (which represents the sliding scale rating from 1-100) as a general attitude toward a gay target across activism conditions (as all target characters were identified as male with male partners). It is unsurprising, then, that this measure correlates positively with political orientation, such that more liberal participants had more favourable attitude toward the targets, r (275) = .20, p < .01. Attitude correlated negatively with racism (r = -.24, p < .01) and neoracism (r = -.20, p < .01), as well as with social dominance orientation (r = -.37, 27  p < .01). Interestingly, patriotism showed a positive correlation with attitude, r = .30, p < .01. This was unexpected; as a known correlate of modern homonegativity, it was not anticipated that patriotism would correlate positively with favourable attitudes toward gay targets. It is possible that this was driven by a general positive valence, as many of the patriotism items are fairly positive (e.g., “I love my country”). It is also possible that this unexpected finding is a result of the Canadian sample; given that Canada’s stance on homosexuality is fairly positive relative to other countries, including the United States, patriotism may actually encourage more positive attitudes in Canadians than in the U.S. Notably, patriotism also correlated negatively with racism (r = -.33, p < .01), neoracism (r = -.18, p = .01), and social dominance (r = -.29, p < .01). Correlation tables broken down by condition are presented in Appendix C. Table 2.

Scale reliability values are shown on the diagonal for all multi-item measures. 28  2.3.2.3 MANOVA and Regressions  Turning to the experimental analyses, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to determine the impact of condition on attitude as well as positive and negative trait ratings. Results of this analysis are presented in Table 3.  Table 3. Study 1: Results of MANOVA for activism condition. Dependent Variable F p ηp2 Attitude .287 .751 .002 Negative Traits 3.50 .032* .027 Positive Traits .754 .472 .006 * denotes p < .05. There was no significant difference in attitude ratings between the three groups based on condition (see Figure 1). Positive trait ratings (an aggregation of “pleasant”, “agreeable”, and “considerate”) were also not significantly predicted by condition. However, negative trait ratings (an aggregation of “obnoxious”, “intrusive”, and “annoying”) did differ significantly based on condition (see Table 2).   Results of T-tests showed that those in the LGBTQ activist condition rated the character higher on negative traits (M = 2.04, SD = .81) than those in the environmental activist condition (M = 1.75, SD = .76), t = 2.48, p = .014, d = .378. The LGBTQ activist was also rated more negatively than the library volunteer (M = 1.80, SD = .77), t = 2.17, p = .031, d = .310. No significant difference was noted between the environmental activist and the library volunteer, t = -.452, p = .652.  Separate regression analyses were also run to test for the moderating effects of the known correlates of modern homonegativity noted above: religiosity, religious activity, political orientation, 29  patriotism and nationalism, social dominance orientation, neoracism, and traditional racism. Only social dominance orientation made a significant change to the predictive ability of the model, ΔR2 = .096, F(2,258) = 17.35, p < .001. Although it trended in the expected direction, the interaction of condition and social dominance orientation was non-significant (p = .236). 2.3.2.4 Gender Analyses   Although no set hypotheses were made regarding participants’ gender, it is known that men tend to score higher on the Modern Homonegativity Scale (e.g., Romero et al., 2015); and as such, I conducted a 2x3 MANOVA to examine whether gender may have interacted with condition to produce different attitudes or trait ratings. The MANOVA results indicated that although gender was significantly predictive of all three outcome variables (p < .001), the interaction of gender and condition was not a significant predictor of any (see Table 4).                30  Table 4.

Zero-order correlations showed predictable patterns, given previous knowledge of the measured personality traits and values, which had previously been correlated with modern homonegativity. Experimental analyses showed no difference between conditions on their ratings of overall attitude, thereby not supporting Hypothesis 1; there was also no difference on positive trait ratings. However, the LGBTQ activist was rated significantly higher than both of the other groups on negative traits, which partially supports Hypothesis 2. This target character drew attention to their sexuality and advocated for their own group in a way that neither of the other characters did. The difference between the two activism conditions in particular is important. Both activist characters were theoretically pushing for societal change in some 31  manner, and if there was no difference between the conditions, we might conclude that modern homonegativity has more to do with a resistance to change than anything to do with sexual minorities in particular. Instead, the results of this study suggest that LGBTQ activism is associated with more negative traits than environmental activism, at least when it is viewed in connection with a gay individual. No support was found for Hypothesis 3, as none of the potential moderators interacted significantly with condition.   As a preliminary study, this work was missing some important control conditions. All of the targets were male, and all were identified as having a male partner. In order to truly understand attitudes toward targets based on both activism and sexuality, one would need control groups comprising heterosexual targets, and ideally would include both male and female targets. As such, Study 2 replicates and extends this work using a 2x2x3 factorial design: male and female targets, targets with same-sex and different-sex partners, and the same three activism conditions as were used in Study 1.  3 Study 2  In addition to the change noted above, Study 2 also split the single bipolar attitudinal scale used in Study 1 into two unipolar attitudinal scales; this change is described in more detail in section 3.2.3. An imagined behaviour was also included as an additional outcome variable, wherein participants were asked how much they would hypothetically donate to the target character’s organization. 3.1 Hypotheses  The following hypotheses were made regarding Study 2: 32  1. Participants would rate the LGBTQ+ activist target more negatively than the environmental activist of the library volunteer when the target character was in a same-sex relationship (and was thereby “promoting” their own sexuality). 2. Participants would rate the negative traits more highly for the LGBTQ+ activist when the target character was in a same-sex relationship. 3. Participants would be willing to donate less money to the LGBTQ+ activist when the target was in a same-sex relationship. 4. These effects could be moderated by the same potential moderators included in Study 1; although these interactions were not observed to be significant in Study 1, they were nonetheless included again for the sake of interest. In accordance with existing literature, higher scores on these scales should generally lead to more negative evaluations of LGBTQ+ targets, again with the exception of political orientation. 5. No specific hypotheses were made regarding target gender; however, the condition was included as an independent variable to ensure that there were no substantial differences in any of the dependent variables based on target gender. 3.2 Method 3.2.1 Study Preregistration  This study was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework; the registration is publicly available at https://osf.io/sak4e/  3.2.2 Study Participants   610 undergraduate students were recruited from the university student subject pool. 86 participants identified themselves as being non-heterosexual or non-heteroromantic, and as with Study 33  1, they were removed from the data set. The final sample comprised 407 women and 115 men (with two unidentified) for a sample size of 524. Participants ranged in age from 17 to 46 years (M = 18.30, SD = 1.70).  30.3% of the sample identified their ethnicity as White or Caucasian, 24.2% identified as Asian or East Asian, 9.9% identified as South Asian, and 10.1% identified as Canadian. The remaining 25.2% of participants identified as another ethnicity or as a mixed ethnicity.  The sample was again fairly non-religious, with 32.6% of participants responding that they were not at all religious, 33.0% responding slightly religious, 25.8% responding somewhat religious, and 4.6% responding very religious. Church participation was again fairly uncommon; on a scale from 1 (“Never”) to 5 (“Daily”), the mean of the three church-participation items was 1.95.  Participants were again more liberal than conservative, with 18.9% identifying themselves as liberal, 29.0% identifying as fairly liberal, 19.3% as fairly conservative, and only 7.1% as conservative. Again, a significant portion of participants either did not respond or responded “I don’t know” (25.8%).  As in Study 1, most participants had completed roughly the same amount of education; 83.4% of participants reported their highest education level as a high school diploma, and 14.3% responded “some university”. Only 1.8% of participants reported that they had completed a Bachelor’s degree or a college diploma or certificate. 3.2.3 Materials and Procedure   Study 2 was set up as a replication and extension of Study 1. Participants were once again invited into the research lab to complete the survey, and responded to the same battery of demographic questionnaires and potential moderating variables as in Study 1; Cronbach’s alpha values, calculated to assess scale reliability in Study 2, are displayed on the diagonal in Table 4. Participants were then 34  presented with a character profile, as before; however, there were now 12 conditions in total, as opposed to the original three. Study 2 varied the gender of the character (male/female), the gender of their partner (male/female), and their activist condition (LGBTQ/environmental/library). Eric(a) is a 29-year-old human resources manager at a regional hospital. (S)he is in a long-term relationship with his(her) boyfriend(girlfriend), Michael(Michelle), a nurse whom (s)he met through work. The two live together in an apartment above a sporting good store. Eric(a) is an active individual, playing on a recreational co-ed soccer team twice a week and jogging in his(her) spare time. (S)he enjoys cooking and hosts a dinner party for friends once a month. Eric(a) also volunteers with a local LGBTQ activism group / a local environmental activism group / a local library, which often involves going door-to-door in the evenings, distributing information about upcoming events. His(her) friends describe him(her) as friendly, intelligent, outgoing, and honest, but sometimes selfish and impolite. After reading this description, participants were asked to rate their overall attitude toward the character on a sliding scale from 1-100, as in Study 1; however, in Study 2, the attitude scale was split into two unipolar scales. That is, participants were asked to rate how positive their attitude was toward the character on a scale from 1-100, and then how negative their attitude was toward the character on a scale of 1-100. This decision was based on the fact that in Study 1, participants rated the LGBT+ activist more negatively (but not more positively) on the trait descriptors than the other two characters. Participants were then once again asked to rate the degree to which they would apply various different traits to Michael, including three negative traits (obnoxious, intrusive, annoying) and three positive traits (pleasant, agreeable, considerate), on a scale from 1 (“Not at all”) to 5 (“Extremely”).   Finally, participants were asked to imagine that they were at home on a weekday evening, and the character in questions has knocked on their door: 35   You open the door the find that they are going door-to-door to fund-raise for their organization. They say the following to you:  “Hi there! My name is Eric(a) and I’m here to talk to you about the organization I volunteer with, which is a local LGBT activism group / environmental activism group / library. This organization is doing some really wonderful work in our community and has changed a lot of lives for the better. My partner Michael (Michelle) and I have both worked with the group for years, and we’ve had a really positive experience. We’re currently trying to organize a community seminar to take place next month, which we hope will educate individuals about important LGBT issues/environmental issues/library programs in London. We’re hoping that this might be a cause you are willing to donate to. We rely on the support of our local community, and wouldn’t be able to host events or offer many of our available programs without donations from individuals like you. Every little bit helps, even if it’s only a couple dollars.”  Participants were then asked how much money they would be willing to donate to this cause, on a five point scale: “None”, “One to ten dollars”, “Eleven to twenty dollars”, “Twenty-one to thirty dollars”, or “More than thirty dollars”. They were also asked to explain their donation amount in a free-form text box. 3.3 Results 3.3.1 Data Cleaning   As noted, all participants who identified themselves as a romantic or sexual minority were removed from the analysis. No outliers were removed and no participants needed to be removed for completing the survey too quickly. 36  3.3.2 Data Analysis 3.3.2.1 Descriptive Statistics  Descriptive statistics collapsed across condition for Study 2 are presented in Table 5; they are broken down by predictor variables in a series of tables in Appendix D.

The mode value was 2, or “One to ten dollars”, with 326 participants (62.2%) selecting this option.  37  3.3.2.2 Zero-Order Correlations Table 6.

Scale reliability values are shown on the diagonal for all multi-item measures.  Zero-order correlations in this study showed much the same pattern as the zero-order correlations in Study 1 (see Table 6). Correlations separated by predictor are presented in Appendix E. 3.3.2.3 MANOVA  A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted in order to assess the effect of the three conditions (activism, character gender, and character orientation) on the five dependent variables (the two attitude scales, positive and negative trait ratings, and amount of money donated). Participant gender was included as a fourth predictive factor, again due to its known association with modern homonegativity. The results are presented below in Table 7.  Table 7.

With a significant four-way interaction, the three-way interactions become less important to interpret; rather, the next step would be to examine the “simple simple simple” effects (SSS effects) of the most theoretically important variable. This means holding three of the predictor variables constant while examining the effect of the fourth. In this study, activism condition was identified as the most theoretically important variable. I have conducted SSS effects analyses at each level of the other three variables, which are presented below. Notably, I chose to present the tables broken down by participant gender; this is because the three-way interaction without participant gender was also the only one to show no significant prediction of any dependent variable. Regardless, all levels of both other variables (character gender and orientation) were considered. I first present SSS effects as they apply to the donation variable, which was significantly predicted by the four-way interaction, F(2,475) = 3.317, p = .037, ηp2 = .014.          45  Table 8.

Female participants, however, indicated a willingness to donate more to environmental activists than to LGBTQ activists, p = .007; no other comparisons were significant. When targets were male and straight, the analysis showed no significant SSS effects for either male or female participants, ps > .054. When targets were female and gay, there was a significant SSS effect of activism condition for male participants. Men were willing to hypothetically donate more money to the library volunteer than either the LGBTQ activism (p = .004) or the environmental activist (p = .021). The SSS effect of activism was not significant for female participants, ps > .385. Finally, when targets were female and straight, there were no significant SSS effects for either male nor female participants, ps > .288.   Overall, this is an interesting pattern of effects to consider. Among male participants, activism seemed only to show an effect when they were considering donations toward gay female characters. Among female participants, it seemed only to matter when considering donations toward gay male targets. I would hesitate to interpret this finding too strongly, especially as the sample size for these comparisons was quite small (particularly for the sparse male participant pool); at this level, analyses often only comprised 8-10 participants per cell. However, it is interesting to speculate about the possible reasoning behind this effect. Perhaps outgroup-promoting behaviours are particularly abrasive when the target belongs to a gender-based outgroup as well; or perhaps attraction to the same-sex is particularly offensive to straight targets when it is observed in a different-sex target, who could possibly be viewed as a potential mate.   Next, I conducted a similar set of SSS effects analyses for the positive traits variable, which was also significantly predicted by the four-way interaction, F(2,475) = 4.320, p = .014, ηp2 = .018.  47  Table 9. Study 2: Mean positive trait ratings broken down by character gender, orientation, participant gender and activism condition. Character Gender and Orientation Activism Participant Gender Male Female Male/gay LGBTQ M = 10.70 SD = 1.89 N = 10 M = 11.12 SD = 2.44 N = 41 Environmental M = 10.92 SD = 1.50 N = 13 M = 11.00 SD = 2.32 N = 40 Library M = 8.00 SD = 3.422 N = 8 M = 12.04 SD = 2.03 N = 25 Male/straight LGBTQ M = 10.47 SD = 2.10 N = 15 M = 11.13 SD = 2.06 N = 30 Environmental M = 10.69 SD = 2.10 N = 13 N = 10.63 SD = 1.90 N = 30 Library M = 11.63 SD = 1.19 N = 8 M = 10.86 SD = 1.91 N = 36 Female/gay LGBTQ M = 9.200 SD = 1.48 N = 5 N = 11.14 SD = 2.55 N = 29 Environmental M = 11.63 SD = 1.92 N = 8 M = 10.09 SD = 2.15 N = 35 Library M = 10.67 SD = 2.00 N = 9 M = 10.89 SD = 2.28 N = 37 Female/straight LGBTQ M = 11.11 SD = 1.54 N = 9 M = 11.02 SD = 1.97 N = 41 Environmental M = 9.750 SD = .957 N = 4 M = 10.94 SD = 1.87 N = 33 Library M = 11.33 SD = 1.87 N = 12 M = 11.67 SD = 2.20 N = 27  48  When the target was male and gay, there was a significant SSS effect of activism for men, such that male participants described the library volunteer less positively than either the LGBTQ activist (p = .049) or the environmental activist (p = .014). This runs in a rather unexpected direction. Levene’s test showed a significant inequality of variances between the environmental and library groups (F = 7.477, p = .013); however, the effect was still significant even when assuming inequality of variances (p = .049). There was no significant SSS effect for female participants, ps > .070. There were no significant SSS effects of activism for either male or female participants when character gender was male and orientation was straight.  When character gender was female and orientation was gay, there was a SSS effect of activism condition on positive trait ratings for male participants; men rated the environmental activist more positively than the LGBTQ activist, p = .035 (see Table 9). No other comparisons were statistically significant. Finally, when character gender was female and orientation was straight, there were no significant SSS effects of activism for either men or women (ps > .133).  Again, this is quite a lot of data to work through. Male participants showed a simple effect of activism condition in an unexpected direction when rating gay male targets; they also showed a simple effect of activism, but in a more expected direction, when rating gay female targets. Again, with the small sample size used for these comparisons, I would hesitate to put too much weight on these results. However, it is interesting to note that the expected pattern emerged once again for gay targets of a different gender.  To briefly address the two- and three-way interactions observed in the MANOVA, I would note that no interactions that did not include participant gender were significantly predictive of any dependent variables. I would conclude that participant gender likely plays a substantial role here, and that gender should certainly be included in analyses from this point forward. 49  Given that none of the results indicated prejudice toward the LGBTQ activist, the moderators tested in Study 1 were not tested here. 3.4 Discussion   The results of this study were not consistent with the findings of Study 1, nor were they consistent with any of the hypotheses laid out for Study 2. First, no effect of condition was found on the negative trait ratings; and further, any observed effect of condition seemed to have been driven by ratings of the environmental activist, not the LGBTQ activist. No significant effect of activism condition was observed for negative attitude, nor positive attitude or positive trait ratings.  Given that the samples from Study 1 and Study 2 were collected roughly six months apart, at the same university, it seems unlikely that the samples themselves were substantially different. The mean ages in the two samples were similar (M = 18.42 in Study 1, and M = 18.30 in Study 2), and religiosity levels were similar (M = 3.00 in Study 1, and M = 3.05 in Study 2). The first sample did include a higher proportion of men (30.7% male) than the second (22% male), which may have had some impact, given that men have reported consistently higher levels of modern homonegativity in past work (e.g. Romero, et al., 2015).   The results of the two studies described above are inconclusive. The Study 1 data suggests that sexual minorities who actively campaign for their own rights may be described more negatively than those who do not; however, the data from Study 2 did not replicate this finding, and in fact seemed to suggest that the environmental activist was more unlikeable than either target character.   Based on these mixed findings, the logical next step was to test this effect while including the Modern Homonegativity Scale itself. Using the MHS as a moderator might allow for the demonstration of a significant effect of condition among high scorers on the MHS (but not low scorers, as this group 50  should not dislike activists any more than non-activists). However, prior to completing this last step in the main program of research, a brief intermediary study was conducted to ensure the validity of the trait descriptors being assessed. The three positive and three negative traits used in Studies 1 and 2 were chosen intuitively, based on traits that seemed appropriate given the character descriptions provided to participants; however, for the final study, I wanted to ensure that participants were rating the traits that would most commonly be used to describe door-to-door volunteers. Study 3, therefore, was a small-scale study designed to assess which traits would be used most commonly to describe such individuals.  4 Study 3 4.1 Hypotheses  No specific hypotheses were made regarding Study 3. As noted above, this study was designed simply to ensure that the right descriptors were being tested in Study 4; no particular descriptors were predicted to be the most commonly selected. Similarly, no specific hypothesis was made about the correlation between the MHS and trait ratings; this was tested out of interest and for the sake of understanding the scale better, but there was no reason to suppose that it would have any particular directional effect here. 4.2 Method 4.2.1 Study Preregistration  This study was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework; the registration is publicly available at https://osf.io/5sr79/ 51  4.2.2 Study Participants   101 participants were recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Knowing that Study 4 would be conducted using MTurk as a recruitment pool, I elected to shift to this platform for Study 3 as well. Due to recent concerns about data quality from MTurk (e.g. Dreyfuss, 2018), two checks were put in place to identify non-human or careless responders. First, a reCAPTCHA tool was included, which participants would have to click through before beginning the survey. Secondly, an attention check item was included in the randomized list of possible trait descriptors, and any participants who failed this attention check were removed from the final dataset. Of the 101 participants, 12 were removed based on their attention check responses, leaving a dataset of 89 responders.  This sample was more diverse on some variables than the university samples used in Studies 1 and 2. 47 participants identified as male, and 40 as female (with 1 declining to respond). Participants ranged in age from 18 to 62 years (M = 34.63, SD = 9.73). Ethnicity was significantly less diverse in this population: 73.0% identified their ethnicity as White or Caucasian, 10.1% as Black or African American, 3.4% as Asian, and 3.4% as Hispanic. 6.8% of participants left this question unanswered, and the remaining 2.2% identified another ethnicity or a mixed ethnicity.  Participants were again more liberal than conservative; 34.8% identified as liberal, 20.2% as fairly liberal, 23.6% of fairly conservative, and 18.0% as conservative (M = 2.74, with 1 being “conservative” and 4 being “liberal”). There was a greater diversity of education level in this sample, as expected. 13.5% of participants reported that their highest level of education was a high school diploma or GED; 3.4% reported a college diploma or certificate; 18% reported some university; 49.4% reported a bachelor’s degree; 13.5% reported a Master’s degree; and 1.1% reported having a Ph.D (with 1.1% declining to answer this question). 52  4.2.3 Materials and Procedure   Participants were recruited to participate in the study via MTurk, and were then redirected to Western University’s Qualtrics page to complete the survey. They responded to a brief battery of demographic questionnaires including age, ethnicity, romantic and sexual orientation, education, and political orientation. They also completed the MHS, and were then asked to rate how positive and negative their feelings were toward door-to-door volunteers (using two unipolar scales, as in Study 2). Finally, they were presented with a list of potential positive and negative trait descriptors, and were asked to what extend they agreed that each of these words were descriptive of door-to-door volunteers. At the end of the study, participants were provided with a code to input on MTurk in order to receive their compensation of $0.50.  4.3 Results  4.3.1 Data Cleaning   As noted above, 12 participants were removed from the initial data set due to inattentive responding. This left a sample of 89 participants, which would certainly be quite small for any kind of comparative analysis. However, Study 3 involved only correlations and descriptive statistics, and as such, this relatively small sample size was deemed adequate. 4.3.2 Data Analysis    Descriptive statistics for Study 3 are presented in Table 10.   53  Table 10. Study 3: Descriptive statistics for relevant study variables.  N Mean Standard Deviation Possible Range 1. MHS 85 2.83 1.15 1.00-5.00 2. Political orientation 86 2.74 1.14 1.00-4.00 3.

Positive Traits Average 80 4.59 1.27 1.00-7.00  First, zero-order correlations between relevant study variables were examined. Average scores for the positive and negative trait ratings were computed to determine whether modern homonegativity might be correlated with attitudes toward and trait ratings of door-to-door volunteers in general (not just LGBTQ advocates). These correlations are presented in Table 11, along with Cronbach’s alphas for measures with more than one item.        54  Table 11. Study 3: Zero-order correlations for relevant study variables.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1. MHS α = .96       2. Political orientation -.51**       3. Education .16 .14      4.

Positive Traits Average .25* -.23* .02 -.43** .62** -.36** α = .95 * denotes p < .05; ** denotes p < .01. Higher political orientation values indicate more liberal politics. Higher education values indicate more education. Higher MHS values indicate greater prejudice.  These correlations themselves were quite interesting. Of particular note is the fact that scores on the MHS correlated significantly and positively with both positive trait ratings, r(87) = .25, p = .03, and negative trait ratings (r = .25, p = .03) of door-to-door volunteers, despite the fact that positive and negative trait ratings correlated negatively with each other (r = -.36, p < .01). In fact, when delving further into the specific trait words, the MHS showed positive correlations even with pairs of antonyms: it was positively correlated with both the traits “sincere” (r = .27, p = .01) and “insincere” (r = .24, p = .03). One possibility is that those who score high on the MHS have rather ambivalent attitudes toward volunteers; another is that they are simply “extreme” responders (although in this case, one would expect extreme negative responses as well). This underscores the necessity of including both positive and negative attitude scales in research on this topic, as a bipolar scale would likely not capture this 55  potential ambivalence. The MHS also correlated positively with negative overall attitudes toward door-to-door volunteers (r = .23, p =.03), but did not show any significant correlation with overall positive attitude toward volunteers (r = .16, p = .16).  It was also worth noting that the MHS did show a fairly normal distribution in this sample, indicating that it was not subject to severe floor effects or other issues. The mean score on the scale was 2.83 (on a scale from 1-5), with a standard deviation of 1.15 and a range of 1.00-4.92. The scale did skew slightly to the left (that is, lower MHS values were more commonly produced by participants), but with a skewness statistic of -.25, it fit well within the bounds of acceptable skewness (i.e., indicating normal distribution), which have been identified as -2.0 to 2.0 for both skewness and kurtosis (George & Mallery, 2010, as cited in Muzaffar, 2016). The scale also showed an acceptable kurtosis statistic of -1.18; a high degree of kurtosis would indicate significant tail extremity, likely reflecting the presence of clear outliers.   The next step, the most relevant to this study, was to rank-order descriptive traits to identify those to be used as descriptors in Study 4. This involved simply calculating mean ratings for each item and selecting the positive and negative traits that were most highly endorsed. The full list of traits, rank ordered from highest- to lowest-endorsed, are presented in Table 12.  The top five traits in each category were retained for use in Study 4, including “caring”, “nice”, “friendly”, “polite”, and “sincere” (positive), and “annoying”, “intrusive”, “disruptive”, “inconsiderate”, and “obnoxious” (negative).       56  Table 12.

Tables 13-16 show that the gender by modern homonegativity interaction term was not significantly predictive of any of the attitudinal variables. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that neither character gender nor character orientation was a factor in Study 3, and participant gender was most important in Study 2 as it interacted with those variables. Participant gender will be examined again in Study 4. 4.4 Discussion   This study was, as previously noted, quite brief and featured basic descriptive analyses. It did produce some interesting food for thought, however. The implication that high MHS scorers might have highly ambivalent attitudes toward door-to-door volunteers, or that they might be rather extreme responders, was a good piece of information to have in mind while interpreting the data from Study 4. Identifying the traits most commonly applied to door-to-door volunteers was also important for the validity of the research program, and it was valuable to get a sense of the psychometric properties of 59  the MHS when used with an MTurk sample, since Study 4 was designed to be conducted on MTurk as well. Overall, this study was an interesting stepping stone to the final stage of this research program. 5 Study 4  There were several changes to the research protocol for Study 4, which are described in more detail in section 5.2.3. For the sake of understanding the hypotheses detailed in section 5.1, a brief summary of changes is included here. First, the MHS was added to assess levels of modern homonegativity among participants. A measure of erotophilia/erotophobia was introduced as a new control variable, and several of the previously-tested moderator variables that had had no significant effect in Studies 1 and 2 were dropped from the procedure. Finally, a true behavioural measure was added, wherein participants were told they could donate part of their compensation from the study toward the organisation for which their target character was volunteering. They were then asked to distinguish what proportion of their compensation they would like to donate. This donation did not actually occur due to logistical and ethical constraints, but participants were informed of this deception during debriefing and given the chance to donate at their convenience after the study was complete. 5.1 Hypotheses  The following hypotheses were made in regards to Study 4: 1. No main effect of target gender was expected, but different gender conditions were still included in the study and would be included in regression analyses to ensure that it was not showing any particular effects. 2. A main effect of target’s orientation was expected, such that targets identified as being in same-sex relationships would be allocated smaller donations and rated more negatively and less positively than those in different-sex relationships. 60  3. A main effect of modern homonegativity was expected, such that those who scored highly on the MHS would be more negative toward the target character across all experimental conditions. This hypothesis was made based on the findings of Study 3. 4. A three-way interaction of activism condition, target partner gender, and modern homonegativity was expected. Participants who score high on the MHS and are in the same-sex-partner/LGBTQ+ activism condition should display higher negativity and lower positivity toward the character than those in the other partner gender / activism conditions, and donate less money to their organizations. 5.2 Method 5.2.1 Study Preregistration  This study was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework; the registration is publicly available at https://osf.io/bxvq5/ 5.2.2 Study Participants   725 participants were recruited from MTurk, with anyone over the age of 18 allowed to participate. Studies 3 and 4 were shifted to MTurk to recruit a more diverse sample on several factors, including age, political orientation, and education, all of which have been known to correlate with attitudes toward sexual minorities (e.g. Herek & McLemore, 2013). This study again made use of a reCAPTCHA and an attention check, as well as several manipulation checks; 29 participants were removed for answering the attention item incorrectly, and a further 111 were removed for incorrectly identifying the gender, partner gender, or activism condition of the character presented to them. Following this, 87 participants were identified as non-heterosexual or non-heteroromantic, and were 61  removed from the dataset. This left a final sample of 250 men and 246 women (with two unidentified) for a total of 498 participants. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 77 years (M = 38.70, SD = 11.61).  75.5% of the sample identified their ethnicity as White or Caucasian; notably, both Hispanic and non-Hispanic White identifiers were included in this group. 6.2% reported their ethnicity as Asian or East Asian, 5.8% as Black or African-American, 3.5% as Hispanic or Latino, 3.4% as American, and 1.0% as mixed or biracial. The remaining 4.6% identified as another ethnicity (European, Middle Eastern/Arabic, South or Southeast Asian, or Native American).  Participants in this study were still slightly more liberal than conservative, but this effect was much weaker than it had been in Studies 1 and 2. In this study, 19.9% identified as conservative, 23.7% as fairly conservative, 21.9% as fairly liberal, and 28.7% as liberal (with 5.8% not responding). This means that 46.3% of responders reported conservative or fairly conservative; by contrast, this number was only  34.9% in Study 1, and 35.5% in Study 2.  This sample also showed greater diversity in education than in Studies 1 or 2, as expected. 14.9% of participants reported their highest education level as a high school diploma or GED; 5.8% reported a college diploma or certificate; 21.5% had some university; 45.6% had a Bachelor’s degree; 10.8% had a Master’s degree; and 1.4% had a Ph.D. 5.2.3 Materials and Procedure   Study 4 used the same conditions as Study 2, with target characters varying based on their gender, their partner’s gender, and their activism condition; however, the MHS was added in this study, and was treated as a continuous independent variable. Several other minor changes are described in procedural order below. 62  Participants were recruited from MTurk and redirected to a Qualtrics survey, and responded to the same battery of demographic questionnaires as in Studies 1 and 2.  The potential moderator scales followed. Several of the potential moderators measured in studies 1 and 2 (religiosity and religious activity, racism and neoracism, nationalism, and patriotism) were not included in Study 4 for the sake of time. Social dominance orientation was retained, as this was a significant predictor in Study 1; however, the scale was updated to its newest form, which measures two distinct dimensions of social dominance (trait dominance and trait antiegalitarianism; Ho et al., 2015). Notably, social dominance orientation was included as a potential moderator in Studies 1 and 2, due to the absence of the MHS as a predictor variable; closely-correlated measures such as social dominance orientation were included in those studies essentially as proxies for the MHS itself. In Study 4, which included the MHS, social dominance orientation was viewed largely as a control variable: it was included in regression analyses, but given no theoretical reason to expect that it should interact with the MHS, it was not included in interaction analyses. Political orientation was also retained in Study 4 as a measure of conservatism. One new potential moderator was added: the Sexual Opinion Survey (Fisher, White, Byrne, & Kelley, 1988), a measure of erotophilia and erotophobia. Sample items from this scale include “Masturbation can be an exciting experience” and “The thought of engaging in unusual sex practices is highly arousing”. This scale was added as a means of determining whether discomfort with sex and sexuality in general might lead to more negative or less positive evaluations of those who draw attention to their own sexual orientation, as sexual discomfort has been linked with homophobia in the past (Cheval et al., 2016). Although there is relatively little theoretical indication to include this measure (as, to my knowledge, it has previously been untested in this context), my inclination was that modern homonegativity – which is based so heavily on an aversion to attention-drawing and convention-defying behaviour, specifically those promoting non-traditional sexual relationships – may be linked to erotophobia, which itself 63  measures distaste for unconventional sexual practices. Without any further theoretical indication, erotophobia was essentially included as an exploratory variable. However, several items on the Sexual Opinion Survey explicitly mentioned same-sex relationships or sexual experiences were remove. I chose to remove these items to avoid multicollinearity between the scales; my inclination was that these items would correlate highly with the MHS. Specifically, the following items were removed: “If I found out that a close friend of mine was homosexual, it would annoy me”; “Thoughts that I may have homosexual tendencies would not worry me at all”; “The idea of my being physically attracted to members of the same sex is not depressing”; and “When I think about seeing pictures showing someone of the same sex as myself masturbating, it nauseates me”. Participants also responded to the MHS during this block of the survey. Participants were then presented with a character profile, nearly identical to what participants saw in Study 2. The profile once again varied based on the gender of the character (male/female), the gender of their partner (male/female), and their activist condition (LGBTQ/environmental/library). In order to make the character’s volunteer work seem more applicable to all participants (who were not localized in a particular city, as the participants of studies 1 and 2 had been), the organizations were altered to represent real national non-profits. The LGBTQ activist now volunteered with GLAAD (the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), which was described to participants as “a national LGBTQ activism group”. The environmental activist volunteered with Environment America, and the library volunteer now worked with the American Library Association. As such, the descriptions looked as follows: Eric(a) is a 29-year-old human resources manager at a regional hospital. (S)he is in a long-term relationship with his(her) boyfriend(girlfriend), Michael(Michelle), a nurse whom (s)he met through work. The two live together in an apartment above a sporting good store. Eric(a) is an 64  active individual, playing on a recreational co-ed soccer team twice a week and jogging in his(her) spare time. (S)he enjoys cooking and hosts a dinner party for friends once a month. Eric(a) also volunteers with GLAAD / Environment America / the American Library Association; his(her) duties involve fundraising and spreading the word about GLAAD/Environment America/the American Library Association. His(her) friends describe him(her) as friendly, intelligent, outgoing, and honest, but sometimes selfish and impolite.   As noted above, a manipulation check was included immediately after participants were presented with this profile. Participants were asked three questions: “What is the gender of the person you were reading about?” (male/female); “What was the gender of their partner?” (male/female); and “What organisation did they volunteer for?” (GLAAD/Environment America/the American Library Association). The instructions for the question explicitly noted that participants could click back to the previous screen to find the correct answer if they needed to, with the hope that this would encourage participants to pay attention to this information if they had glossed over it the first time around. After reading the manipulation check, participants were asked to rate their overall attitude toward the character on two unipolar (positive and negative) sliding scales from 1-100, as in Study 2. Participants were then once again asked to rate the degree to which they would apply various different traits to Eric(a), including the five most commonly identified negative traits from Study 3 (annoying, intrusive, disruptive, inconsiderate, obnoxious) and the five most commonly identified positive traits (caring, nice, friendly, polite, sincere) on a scale from 1 (“Not at all”) to 5 (“Extremely”).   As in Study 2, participants were asked to imagine that they were at home on a weekday evening, and the character in questions has knocked on their door and asked for a donation to their organisation. These questions were tailored to participants based on which character profile they had previously seen. 65  Participants were then asked how much money they would be willing to donate to this cause, on a five point scale: “None”, “One to ten dollars”, “Eleven to twenty dollars”, “Twenty-one to thirty dollars”, or “More than thirty dollars”. They were also asked to explain their donation amount in a free-form text box.  Finally, to take this from a hypothetical behaviour to a real one, participants were told that as a part of this study they would be given the opportunity to donate a part of their compensation to the organisation their character represented (again, this was tailored for each activism condition). They were also reminded of what the organisation represented (e.g. “As you know, GLAAD is a national LGBTQ activism group.)  Participants were then told the following:  The compensation for this study is $0.80 per participant. You may choose to keep this entire amount for yourself if you would like to. You may also choose to donate part or all of your compensation to the organisation.  This amount will be automatically deducted from the compensation you receive at the end of the survey. Please ensure that you have clicked on your preferred choice.  How much of your compensation would you like to donate?  None (I would like to keep $0.80)  Ten cents (I would like to keep $0.70)  Twenty cents (I would like to keep $0.60)  Thirty cents (I would like to keep $0.50)  Forty cents (I would like to keep $0.40)  Fifty cents (I would like to keep $0.30) 66   Sixty cents (I would like to keep $0.20)  Seventy cents (I would like to keep $0.10)  Eighty cents (I would not like to keep any of my compensation) In truth, none of the participants’ compensation was donated, regardless of what option they selected for this item. This would have caused numerous complications in both the ethics of the study as well as the logistics of setting this up with MTurk. However, during the debriefing stage of the study, participants were informed of this deception and provided with links to donate to all three of the organisations if they chose to do so.  5.3 Results  5.3.1 Data Cleaning   As noted above, 29 participants were removed for answering the attention item incorrectly, and a further 111 were removed for incorrectly responding to the manipulation check items. 87 participants were then removed after identifying their orientation as non-heterosexual and/or non-heteroromantic. No other participants were removed from the data. Scales with more than one item were computed and interaction terms were created for independent variables (activism condition, orientation condition, and MHS score); this step was necessary as this study needed to be analysed using a multiple regression approach, due to the presence of a continuous predictor variable (the MHS).  5.3.2 Exploratory Factor Analysis  67   Out of interest, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted to assess the dimensionality of the MHS. The test identified one factor, with 65.56% of its variance explained by the 12 scale items; this suggests that the MHS is unidimensional (see Figure 1). Factor loadings were in the range of .629-.884.  Figure 1. Study 4: Scree plot for MHS. 5.3.3 Descriptive Statistics and Correlations  Descriptive statistics for relevant study variables are presented in Table 17. I expected that both the hypothetical and actual donation amounts might be relatively low for all participants, and this was important to know prior to considering these as outcome variables.       68  Table 17. Study 4: Descriptive statistics for relevant study variables, collapsed across conditions.   Again, hypothetical donation amount and actual donation amount are both likely better described using mode values than means. Hypothetical donation amount, with a mean of 1.82, had a modal response of 2, or “One to ten dollars”, with 207 respondents (41.6%) choosing this option; however, a nearly-equal 205 participants (41.2%) selected “None”.  As predicted, actual donation amount was quite low, with the modal participant indicating they would donate 0% of their compensation; 357 respondents (71.7%) selected this option. In fact, 96.2% of participants indicated that they would donate less than half of their total compensation (which was $0.80 CAD). This relatively small variation serves as a warning sign that actual donation amount may make for a poor outcome variable; it is unlikely to vary significantly as a function of any other variable, as it varies so little in the first place. Regardless, this variable was retained out of interest.   N M SD Possible Range 1. MHS 483 2.79 1.07 1.00-5.00 2. Political Orientation 469 2.63 1.13 1.00-4.00 3.

Although a comparison of these tables would yield much the same information as the tests of main effects presented below, this information is provided for the sake of thoroughness. I then examined the zero-order correlations of relevant study variables. These correlations are presented in Table 18, along with Cronbach’s alphas for measures with more than one item. None of the attitudinal scores or donating behaviours are broken down by condition in this analysis, so correlations with any of these variables indicate a correlation with ratings of a target who could be any combination of activism and orientation conditions. For example, the significant correlation between political orientation and negative trait ratings, r(496) = -.28, p < .01, should not be taken to mean that political orientation is correlated with dislike of gay individuals or LGBTQ activists; rather, political orientation is correlated with higher negative trait ratings for whichever target the participant encountered, who could have been gay or straight, and in any of the three activist conditions. Thus, these correlations should be interpreted with caution.            70  Table 18.

Higher MHS scores indicate more prejudice. Scale reliability values are shown on the diagonal for all multi-item measures.  It is interesting, however, to note that political orientation does correlate positively with both of the positive attitudinal variables (although the positive traits correlation, at r = .12, is rather small to be of practical significance) and negatively with both of the negative attitudinal variables. Trait dominance and trait antiegalitarianism both show the reverse pattern of effects. This may indicate that individuals high on trait dominance and antiegalitarianism, and with more conservative politics, feel more 71  negatively and less positively about all individuals (or at least, all of the individuals presented here; it is possible that some other constant in the character description, such as being a human resources manager or a volunteer, produced this effect). Hypothetical donation amount – the amount that participants indicated they would donate to the target character in an imagined scenario – showed positive correlations with positive attitude (r = .23, p < .01) and positive trait ratings (r = .22, p < .01), but no relationship with either negative attitude or negative trait ratings (ps > .19). Although outside of the main research questions of this research, this is an interesting piece of information. Perhaps the strength of one’s positive attitude toward an individual matters more, at least for imagined behaviour, than the strength of one’s negative attitude toward that same individual.  Another interesting point to note here is the variables that correlate with the actual donation amount variable. This refers to the amount of compensation that participants were willing to give away at the end of the study. Bizarrely, this correlated positively with both negative trait ratings (r = .15, p = .001) and positive trait ratings (r = .10, p = .02), as well as positive attitude (r = .13, p < .01), but showed no significant correlation with negative attitude (r = .01, p = .86). The positive attitude and positive trait ratings are in line with expectations and with the correlations described above for hypothetical donation amounts; but this negative trait correlation is difficult to explain. However, as noted previously, correlation coefficients this small would likely not be of practical significance, although the large sample size has made them statistically significant.  Additionally, given the number of zero-order correlations calculated (55 in total), one might wonder whether this unexpected relationship could simply be noise – a type I error produced by random chance among a large number of tested correlations. Indeed, the most stringent alpha correction (the Bonferroni correction; Weisstein, 2007) would dictate that a more appropriate test of 72  significance in this case would be p < .00091 (the standard alpha level of p = .05 is divided by the total number of tests, in this case 55). In this case, the correlation of negative trait ratings with actual donation amount falls above the threshold of significance at p = .001; however, a correction this severe would also negate many of the other findings here. My sense, then, is that this correlation (and most of the others noted here) should be interpreted with caution, if at all. The results of the more important analyses, around which specific hypotheses were formulated, can be taken with more confidence as they are more targeted and should not produce as much noise as a set of 55 correlations. Correlation tables broken down by predictor variables are presented in Appendix G. Although these provide much the same information as the two-way interactions noted below, they are appended to this document for those who would prefer to examine zero-order correlations. 5.3.4 Regression Analyses   Six regression analyses were conducted, each using one of the aforementioned outcome variables (negative and positive trait ratings, negative and positive attitude, hypothetical donation amount, and actual donation amount).  All regression models were split into four steps. The first step included only main effects and covariates: participant gender, target gender, activism condition, orientation, modern homonegativity, erotophilia, trait dominance, and trait antiegalitarianism. The second step included all two-way interactions of participant gender, target gender, activism condition, and orientation. The third step included all three-way interactions of participant gender, target gender, activism condition, orientation, and modern homonegativity. The fourth step included all four-way interactions of participant gender, target gender, activism condition, orientation, and modern homonegativity. 73   A fifth step was initially included in the model, which included only the five-way interaction term of participant gender, target gender, activism condition, orientation, and modern homonegativity. However, this term was excluded from the final model because of severe multicollinearity with the four-way interaction terms. This problem persisted even after centering the one continuous predictor variable (MHS score), which is an effective tool for reducing multicollinearity. Upon further investigation, correlations as high as r = .947 were observed between the five-way interaction terms and the four-way interaction terms. Given their clear similarity, I would conclude that the predictive value of the five-way term could not possibly be significant above and beyond the value of the four-way interaction terms; and as such, it was excluded from the model for all regression analyses.   In all models, activism was dummy-coded into two separate variables. Given that activism had three levels, dummy-coding was essential for interpretation; otherwise, it would be impossible to tell which level of the condition was driving the effect. In all regression models, library volunteering was coded as the reference group (0,0); Activism1 refers to the LGBTQ activism group (1,0) and Activism2 refers to the environmental activism group (0,1).  Although I did not expect a main effect of character gender, it was included in the analysis as it had proved to be a part of the significant four-way interaction in Study 2. With those same four independent variables as well as modern homonegativity score in Study 4, the model now includes five main effects, 10 two-way interaction terms, 10 three-way interaction terms, five four-way interaction terms, and a five-way interaction terms, for a total of 31 predictive terms 74  5.3.4.1 Negative Trait Ratings  Table 19.

As indicated at the bottom of Table 19, Models 1 and 2 added significantly to the predictive value of the regression equation, while Models 3 and 4 did not. As such, the four-way and three-way interaction terms in these models will be disregarded, as they do not contribute anything further to the equation. In Model 1, a main effect of MHS score was noted (p < .001), indicating that higher MHS scores predicted higher negative trait ratings. Participant gender was also a significant predictor, with men producing higher negative trait ratings than women. The last observed main effect was of trait dominance (p = .012), which suggests that those endorsing dominance more highly also tended to rate the targets more negatively overall. 78   There were several significant two-way interactions observed in Model 2. The inclusion of these interaction terms also changed the predictive value of the main effects, which should now be called “conditional effects”; as there were interaction terms present in the model, the coefficient of any single variable (e.g. X) now represents the effect of X when any other term that it interacts with (e.g. Y) is held at 0. In other words, it represents the “leftover” variance accounted for by that single variable, after parsing out the variance accounted for by any of its interactions. In Model 2, MHS and participant gender ceased to be significant predictors, suggesting that their predictive value was largely captured by the two-way interaction terms. Trait dominance remained a significant predictor (p = .026), and the orientation term became a significant predictor as well (p = .009), with gay targets being rated higher on negative traits.    Figure 2. Study 4: Two-way interaction of orientation and activism on negative trait ratings. The first significant two-way interaction is orientation by activism1; this effect is graphed in Figure 2. In this case I used mean ratings to construct the graphs, as there were no continuous variables 00.511.522.533.544.55Straight GayMean Negative Trait RatingsTarget OrientationLGBTQ Library79  that stood in the way of dividing groups here. The orientation by activism2 term was not a significant predictor, so the environmental activism group was left out of this graph.  It is apparent that the influence of activism is dependent upon the orientation of the target. For straight targets, there is only a slight difference between activism conditions; but for gay targets, LGBTQ activists clearly received more negative ratings than library volunteers.  Orientation also interacted significantly with participant gender (p = .011), as seen in Figure 3.  Figure 3. Study 4: Two-way interaction of orientation and participant gender on negative trait ratings.  Gay targets were rated more negatively than straight targets by male participants; this pattern did not appear for female participants (who, if anything, rated the gay targets less negatively than the straight targets).  Orientation further interacted with MHS scores (p = .013). This effect is graphed in Figure 4. Notably, in this case (and in all interactions involving MHS scores), I have elected not to artificially categorize MHS scores in “low” and “high” groups; as such, line graphs (rather than bar graphs) are used to reflect the continuous nature of the MHS. The line graphs were constructed using standardized beta 00.511.522.533.544.55Male FemaleMean Negative Trait RatingsParticipant GenderStraight Gay80  weights from the multiple regression model, and “low” and “high” values of the MHS were designated as one standard deviation below and above the mean, respectively (for the MHS, which was mean-centered, the mean will always be 0). They should be interpreted as data points on a line, rather than as distinct groups; again, this is reflected in the choice of a line graph (compared to a bar graph).  When considering the Y axis on the left side of these graphs, readers should be aware that these do not reflect the originally scale scores on their respective dependent variables. Because the graphs were built using standardized beta weights, the Y axis is marked by standard deviations of the dependent variable. In Figure 4, for example, the “High MHS” / “gay” data point reflects a negative trait rating roughly 1.9 standard deviations above the mean. As noted, this format will be used for all figures that depict interactions involving a continuous measure (i.e. the MHS).   Figure 4. Study 4: Two-way interaction of orientation and MHS on negative trait ratings.  It would appear that all targets received more negative trait ratings as MHS scores increased; however, the slope of this effect was steeper for gay targets than for straight targets. As noted 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.61.82Low MHS High MHSStandard deviations from mean negative trait ratingMHS ScoreStraight Gay81  previously, the items on the MHS speak only to behaviour and policy, rather than to identity. One could hypothesize, then, that orientation should not have any impact on its own; rather, activism should be the driving factor in determining attitudes toward the target characters. The significance of this effect contradicts that hypothesis, showing that targets are rated more negatively as MHS scores increase, and that this slope is steeper for gay targets than for straight targets.  Finally, MHS scores also interacted with participant gender to significantly predict negative trait ratings (p = .034). This effect is graphed in Figure 5, using the same technique as Figure 4.   Figure 5. Study 4: Two-way interaction of MHS and participant gender. The graph in Figure 9 may appear unintuitive at first blush – it suggests that negative trait ratings actually decrease as MHS scores increase, and that this effect is particularly pronounced among female participants. It is worth noting here that, as this interaction does not involve orientation or activism condition, it does not speak to how the MHS affects attitudes toward any particular group; rather, this 00.20.40.60.811.21.4Low MHS High MHSStandard deviations from mean negative trait ratingMHS ScoreMale Female82  effect is across groups. Given the interactive effect previously noted between MHS scores and orientation, it seems plausible that this effect is driven primarily by attitudes toward straight targets. 5.3.4.2 Positive Trait Ratings   The model for positive trait ratings is presented in Table 20 below.83  Table 20.

Only Model 1 showed a significant change in the R2 value, and as such, no two-, three-, or four-way interactions were examined closely; these did not add significantly to the predictive value of the model. A negative main effect of MHS was observed, wherein higher MHS scores predicted lower positive trait ratings (p < .001). The only other significant effect to of note was a positive main effect of erotophilia (p = .037). Erotophilia was not a significant predictor of negative trait ratings, so it is possible that erotophilia is linked to higher positively but not lesser negativity. This speaks to the importance of measuring positive and negative attitudes separately. 5.3.4.3 Negative Attitude Scale   The model for negative attitude scale is presented in Table 21 below. 87  Table 21.

In this case, Models 1 and 2 contributed significantly to the predictive value of the regression equation, so only they will be discussed.  A main effect of erotophilia was noted again in Model 1 (p = .007), as well as a main effect of trait antiegalitarianism (p = .035) and a main effect of MHS (p < .001). In Model 2, conditional effects of erotophilia (p = .001) and trait antiegalitarianism (p = .026) were observed, but the MHS term ceased to be significant once the variance of the two-way interactions were accounted for (p = .994). The only significant two-way interaction in this model was orientation by MHS score (p = .001). This effect is graphed in Figure 6. As with all interactions involving the MHS, this effect was graphed using regression coefficients.91    Figure 6. Study 4: Two-way interaction of orientation and MHS on negative attitude.  It appears that the slope of negative attitude on MHS scores is steeper for gay targets than for straight ones. This is similar to the effect of the MHS by orientation term in predicting negative trait ratings. Again, this contradicts the hypothesis that MHS scores should not interact with orientation (but rather, only with activism, which is behaviourally based). 5.3.4.4 Positive Attitude Scale   The model for positive attitude scale is presented in Table 22 below.-0.500.511.52Low MHS High MHSStandard deviations from mean negative attitude scoreStraight Gay92  Table 22.

Models 1 and 2 contributed significantly to the predictive value of the equation, so their effects are discussed here. Model 1 showed two significant effects: a main effect of MHS (p < .001) and a main effect of erotophilia (p = .022). In Model 2, erotophilia remained a significant predictor (p = .016), while the conditional effect of the MHS was non-significant (p = .769), indicating that the higher-order interactions with the MHS accounted for much of the variance predicted by this variable. Several significant two-way interactions were observed in Model 2. First, the target gender by MHS term was a significant predictor of positive attitude, p = .038. This effect is graphed in Figure 7. 96   Figure 7. Study 4: Two-way interaction of MHS and target gender on positive attitude.  MHS scores had not previously interacted with target gender in any meaningful way in this study. Here, however, the slope of positive attitude on MHS was observably higher in magnitude for female targets than for male targets. This could be explained by a number of factors. It is possible that high MHS scorers really do have a more positive attitude toward women than men; however, this trend could also reflect a tendency toward benevolent sexism among high MHS scorers.    The orientation by MHS term was also significantly predictive of positive attitude, p = .020. This effect is graphed in Figure 8.      -0.4-0.200.20.40.60.811.21.4Low MH High MHStandard deviations from mean positive attitude scoreMHS ScoreMale Female97   Figure 8. Study 4: Two-way interaction of orientation and MHS on positive attitude.  This is similar to what was observed in previous models, wherein the interaction of MHS and orientation significantly predicted negative trait ratings and attitudes. As noted there, this does not support the hypothesis that orientation itself should not interact with modern homonegativity in predicting attitudes. However, in line with this hypothesis, the MHS by activism1 term was also a predictor of positive attitude, p = .001. This effect is graphed in Figure 9.       -1-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.200.20.40.6Low MH High MHStandard deviations from mean positive attitude scoreMHS ScoreStraight Gay98   Figure 9. Study 4: Two-way interaction of MHS and activism condition on positive attitude.  Figure 12 shows a clear pattern: as MHS scores increase, positive attitude scores decrease for LGBTQ activists, but increase for library volunteers. This is in accordance with expectations: as the MHS items largely refer to behaviour, LGBTQ activism should be associated with less positive attitudes from high MHS scorers.   5.3.4.5 Hypothetical Donation Amount   The model for hypothetical donation amount is presented in Table 23 below.-0.15-0.1-0.0500.050.10.150.20.25Low MH High MHStandard deviations from mean positive attitude scoreMHS ScoreLGBTQ Library99  Table 23.

In this equation, no models added significant predictive value at p = .05. Model 1 showed a marginally significant predictive value, with the significance of the change in F being p = .055. The effects observed in Model 1 are discussed here, but should be treated with caution as a marginal finding.  In Model 1, negative main effects of both activism1 (p = .008) and activism2 (p = .034) were observed, suggesting that library volunteers received greater donations than either activist. The main effect of orientation was also significant and negative, indicating that straight targets received higher donations overall than gay targets (p = .032).  As noted above, the variability of the actual donation amount outcome was quite low; I would suggest that this likely explains the lack of significant predictive value observed in this model. 107  5.4 Discussion   There were a great number of effects discussed in this chapter, presenting a relatively complex view of modern homonegativity.   Across the six models tested here, no three- or four-way interaction terms significantly contributed to the predictive values of their respective regression equations. Although some appeared to be statistically significant, without a significant contribution to the predictive power of the equation, they are meaningless in a practical sense.  Several two-way interactions were also identified as significant predictors. The most consistent of these effects was orientation by modern homonegativity, which significantly predicted negative trait ratings, negative attitude, and positive attitude. Again, this is in contradiction to the hypothesis that modern homonegativity should not interact with orientation, suggesting that scores on the MHS do in fact reflect attitudes that are at least somewhat based on identity (rather than behavioural) information.  However, MHS scores did interact with the activism1 term in predicting positive attitudes, suggesting that – at least in forming positively valenced thoughts and feelings – high MHS scorers likely use behavioural information as well.   The only interpretable main effect to show any consistency across models was erotophilia, which was a significant predictor of positive trait ratings, negative attitude, and positive attitude. Knowing that sexual discomfort has been linked with homonegativity in the past (Cheval et al., 2016), it is possible that higher erotophilia is linked to greater positivity or lower negativity primarily for the gay characters, and that this association drove the main effect across the three attitudinal variables. A brief comparison of correlations divided by condition shows that this is likely not the case; erotophilia’s correlations with the attitudinal variables appear to be of similar magnitude when the target was 108  straight or gay. Similarly, magnitude of correlations seem to be roughly the same across activism conditions. It seems plausible, then, that erotophilia is simply linked to a greater overall positive affect or more positive attitudes toward all people (or at least, all of the target characters in this study; it is possible that this could be driven by a consistent characteristic across profiles, such as age or personality traits).  After spending a great deal of time with this data, my inclination is that, in fact, all five of the main predictor variables (orientation, activism, MHS, participant gender and target gender) may play a role in forming impressions of target characters, as well as erotophilia. However, their relative contributions might be quite small and difficult to observe. As noted, no practically significant three-, four- or five-way interactions were observed in this study, and I would posit that this is due in part to the nature of the manipulation used in this package of studies. This manipulation was relatively weak, and may not have produced such strong reactions as a “real-life”, in-person encounter. The cross-sectional design of this study may also have limited its utility; it is possible that modern homonegativity is more influential in the construction of attitudes over time, as one individual becomes increasingly exposed to the attitudes and behaviours of the other.   Of particular note, however, is the finding that modern homonegativity interacted with both orientation and activism in predicting positive attitudes (and other outcomes, as noted above). Items on the MHS refer exclusively to policy and behaviour, rather than behaviour. As such, one would expect that it should interact with activism, but not orientation. Conversely, if the MHS were simply measuring old-fashioned homonegativity (presented in a more socially acceptable manner), one would expect MHS scores to interact with orientation, but not activism. The fact that it interacted with both in this study presents an interesting lesson: that the scale is likely measuring something different from old-fashioned homonegativity, but that it should not be used without an old-fashioned homonegativity measure also being administered. Elsewise, it would be difficult to assess whether the interaction with orientation is 109  due to a correlation between modern and old-fashioned homonegativity, or whether in fact the MHS is picking up on old-fashioned homonegativity as well. Based on the data here, my inclination is that the MHS should always be used in conjunction with an old-fashioned homonegativity scale in order to parse out this difference. 6 Summary and Discussion   This program of work yielded interesting but limited results that should be of value in informing future research on modern homonegativity, and perhaps on sexual prejudice more generally. First, I will summarize the research questions and findings from the four studies described here; I will then go on to discuss the implications of this work, the limitations of the data, and directions for future research on modern homonegativity and sexual prejudice. 6.1 Summary   As noted in Chapter 1, there is an odd discrepancy in the sexual prejudice literature: while fewer and fewer people report possessing sexual prejudice, many sexual minorities still report widespread experiences of prejudice and discrimination. Morrison and Morrison (2003) suggest that this may be due to the use of culturally irrelevant measures of prejudice, which they propose to replace with the Modern Homonegativity Scale. Modern homonegativity, as defined by the MHS, is focused on behaviours and policies related to gay individuals, rather than homosexuality itself; that is, it measures an attitude toward particular behaviours, rather than an attitude toward an identity.  The present research program began as a means of investigating attitude formation as it relates to modern homonegativity. Does the average person feel more negatively about a gay person who displays self-promoting or group-promoting behaviour than a gay person who doesn’t? Further, do high MHS scorers formulate their attitudes based purely on behaviour, or is there still an identity component 110  to their attitudes? Could this potentially explain the current discrepancy in the sexual prejudice literature?  In Study 1, a student sample was asked to read character profiles and report their attitude toward the target with which they were presented. All targets were gay and male; the only manipulated variable was their activism condition. Participants in this sample rated the LGBTQ activist higher on negative traits than either the environmental activist or the library volunteer, but their overall attitude (on a bipolar scale) and their rating of positive traits did not differ based on activism.  In Study 2, conditions were expanded to include straight targets and female targets. Once again, a student sample rated their attitude toward the characters; however, this study failed to replicate the main effect seen in Study 1. However, a significant four-way interaction of participant gender, target gender, orientation, and activism was observed. Simple effects testing indicated that male participants donated more in a hypothetical scenario to a library volunteer than an LGBTQ activist when the target was a gay female; conversely, female participants donated more to the library volunteer than the LGBTQ activist when the target was a gay male. Under no other conditions did the activism condition play an important role.    A brief third study assessed the traits most commonly used to describe door-to-door volunteers in general, so as to improve the outcome variables in Study 4. It also included the MHS, and the MHS was found to be positively correlated with both positive and negative trait ratings, as well as negative attitudes toward the volunteers.  Finally, Study 4 – the most complex study in this package – assessed the effects of five predictor variables (participant gender, target gender, orientation, activism, and modern homonegativity) on several attitudinal outcome variables, as well as a hypothetical donation amount and an actual donation amount. Findings were mixed, with various combinations of the above variables predicting outcomes. 111  Erotophilia was identified as a predictor of positive trait ratings, positive attitude, and negative attitude, making it the most consistent and interpretable main effect noted in this study; this appears to be relatively consistent across conditions, meaning it was not likely driven by an interaction with character orientation or activism condition. The MHS by orientation term seemed to be the most consistent interactive predictor, with activism condition, target gender and participant gender playing less clear roles. However, the interaction of MHS scores with both activism and orientation indicated that the MHS, when used on its own, is likely measuring aspects of both modern homonegativity and old-fashioned homonegativity. 6.2 Implications   This last finding holds perhaps the most important implication for the field’s understanding of modern homonegativity: that although the MHS is constructed using items that assess attitudes toward specific behaviours and policies, and high-MHS scorers do formulate their attitudes using behavioural information, identity is still important in their attitude formation as well – perhaps even more so than behaviour. This finding may contribute to an understanding of the discrepancy in the sexual prejudice literature in several ways.  First, much of the large-scale polling surveys showing that attitudes toward sexual minorities are improving ask questions that are based more on identity (and behaviour related to that identity) than group-promoting behaviour. For example, Twenge et al. (2016) note that responses to the item “Same-sex sexual behaviour is not wrong at all” have become more accepting in recent decades. This question, although behaviourally-based, asks about a behaviour that is basically essential to homosexuality itself; it is not a self- or group-promoting behaviour, as is referenced in the MHS. It is, essentially, a stand-in measure for old-fashioned homonegativity. It is entirely plausible that a high scorer on the MHS might actually answer “Yes” to this measure, as they feel they do not have a problem with homosexuality in 112  and of itself; this response would indicate to the researcher that they are not prejudiced. Meanwhile, it is evident from the current work that in fact, high-MHS scorers do use identity information in their perception of others, and that this might contribute to real-world perpetration of prejudice and discrimination against LGBTQ individuals regardless of their behaviour.  That said, the MHS does correlate strongly with measures of old-fashioned homonegativity (e.g. Rye & Meaney, 2010b), and as such, this apparent interaction of orientation and modern homonegativity when activism is held constant may actually be driven by old-fashioned homonegativity. A measure of this construct was not included in the current study, and as such, it is impossible to know whether modern homonegativity would still interact with orientation if the variance caused by old-fashioned homonegativity was accounted for. It is my hope that future research will address this issue by examining the two scales together.  On a related note, even if high-MHS scorers did not use identity information in the formulation of their attitudes, their attitudes toward LGBTQ-promoting behaviours might still be construed as prejudice by LGBTQ individuals. That is, LGBTQ individuals might not perceive a difference in negative attitudes toward their identity or negative attitudes toward their behaviour; both might be interpreted as prejudice, and understandably so.  It seems entirely possible, then, that the discrepancy in the sexual prejudice literature is related to modern homonegative attitudes. First, because polling data so frequently uses measures that approximate old-fashioned homonegativity, researchers might be missing more nuanced or subtle attitudes; second, high MHS-scorers might actually be somewhat deluded as to the nature of their own prejudice, and might thereby assess their prejudice as being less than it is; and third, because sexual minorities might perceive modern homonegativity as being prejudicial, while high-MHS scorers might not.  113  6.3 Limitations and Future Research   Of course, these implications are speculative. Many of these conjectures would require in-depth, targeted research to assess, and this research was too broad in nature to include the particular items that might support or disconfirm these ideas. For example, this work did not include any questions about the participants’ awareness of their own prejudice. Of course, the MHS is an explicit scale, and participants knew how they were answering the questions; however, it is impossible to know from this data whether the participants would have considered themselves to be prejudiced against gay identities. An old-fashioned homonegativity scale, or a short proxy (for example, the item used in Twenge et al.’s 2016 work, noted above) would have provided this information had it been included in the present work. If, in fact, many high-MHS scorers perceive themselves as being relatively unprejudiced toward LGBTQ identities, this would go a long way toward explaining the gap between reported prejudice and reported experiences of prejudice. I hope that future work will address this question.  This program of research also did not assess LGBTQ individuals’ perception of modern homonegativity, or of the distinction between attitudes toward behaviours and attitudes toward identities. This would have required an entirely different sample and a new research paradigm. However, this would be another key piece of understanding the discrepancy in the sexual prejudice literature; if LGBTQ individuals perceive negative attitudes toward group-promoting behaviour and policies to be just as prejudicial as negative attitudes toward their identity, then it would help to explain why so much prejudice and discrimination is still being reported, even as old-fashioned homonegative attitudes are disappearing.  As noted in Chapter 5, a behavioural measure was included in Study 4, in the hope of determining whether modern homonegativity (and its interactions with activism and orientation 114  conditions) might actually predict discriminatory behaviour. Unfortunately, this behavioural measure yielded low variability, which made it a poor outcome variable. There are several reasons why the variability of this measure may have been so low. First, participants on MTurk typically receive less than minimum wage as compensation for their participation in research studies; although this is not entirely atypical for research (as participating in research is not commonly viewed as a “job”), participation in research does constitute at least some portion of these participants’ income. Participants were asked to explain, in a free-form text box, why they had chosen the donation amount that they did, and by far the most common response to this question was that the participant needed the money or could not afford to be donating to charities at this time. It is possible that very few participants were in a position to be donating part of their income, and that this created a lack of variability in actual donation amount.  Secondly, it is possible that participants may not have believed the deception that some of their compensation would be donated. At least one participant noted in their free-form response that they knew that researchers were unable to deduct money from their compensation. If participants did not believe that their compensation could actually be allocated to charitable organizations, they may not have taken the question seriously, and as such, simply picked the first option from the list (“I would like to keep $0.80”). That being said, my suspicion is that if participants were not taking the question seriously, answers might have actually been more variable than they were, as participants would not have feared losing any of their compensation; and as such, I would likely attribute the low variability of this measure to the financial issue noted above.  Lastly, as noted in section 5.4, the manipulation for this package of studies was relatively weak. Although an imagined scenario allowed for rapid data collection from a non-student sample, it must be acknowledged that it would be unlikely to elicit reactions as strong as those produced by “real life” in-person interactions. It is my hope that future research will be able to use stronger manipulations, 115  perhaps in the form of highly controlled interactions with confederates, to examine this research question. 6.4 Conclusions   This program of work has produced new and interesting findings related to modern homonegativity, and how behaviour and identity contribute to the formation of attitudes about others. It suggests that group-promoting behaviour is an important factor in the formation of attitudes toward LGBTQ individuals, and that this behaviour informs attitudes above and beyond sexual identity. It also suggests that high scorers on the MHS do formulate their attitudes based on behaviour (i.e. LGBTQ activism), but that their impressions are also moderated by the target’s sexual identity. This finding provides some possible explanations for the current discrepancy in reports of sexual prejudice, which should be explored further in future targeted research. In addition to addressing the knowledge gap in the field, this work is important because it furthers our understanding of contemporary prejudice, which could inform intervention efforts in the future.     116  References  Adolfsen, A., Iedema, J., & Keuzenkamp, S.

    "abstract": "Although reported prejudice toward sexual minorities seems to be decreasing over time, sexual minorities themselves continue to report many experiences of prejudice and discrimination. One potential explanation for this discrepancy in the sexual prejudice literature is that explicit prejudice is being measured in a manner that is no longer culturally relevant, as proposed by Morrison and Morrison (2003) in the development of their Modern Homonegativity Scale. Modern homonegativity (MH) is characterized by negative attitudes toward behaviours and policies that benefit LGBTQ people, rather than a negative attitude toward homosexuality itself. The present work aimed to further the field’s understanding of MH and the role it plays in the formation of attitudes toward others. In Study 1, participants read one of three character profiles, each describing a gay man who volunteered with a particular group: an LGBTQ activism group, an environmental activism group, or a local library. Participants rated the target higher on negative trait descriptors when he was an LGBTQ activist. Study 2, a replication and extension of this work that included straight and female targets, showed a more complicated interaction of participant gender, target gender, target orientation, and target activism. A brief third study assessed which trait descriptors were most commonly applied to volunteers in order to ensure the validity of the outcome variables. Study 4 extended Studies 1 and 2 with the inclusion of MH as a predictor and with a behavioural measure added to the survey. The data from Study 4 suggested that MH contributes to the formation of negative attitudes across conditions, but that it also interacts with both activism condition and orientation to create negative attitudes. This supports the idea that although MH does interact with behavioural information to produce negative attitudes, it also interacts with orientation to produce less favourable attitudes toward gay targets even when activism is held constant. Implications for further work on MH and sexual prejudice in general are discussed",
