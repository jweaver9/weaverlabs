The mostchallenging parenting experiences fell into five major categories: (1) distress abouttheir children’s experiences of exclusion, heterosexism, or homophobic stigmatization;(2) family of origin non-acceptance of their lesbian-parent family; (3) the never-endingprocess of “educating the world about queer parents”; (4) homophobia or hostilitytoward their non-traditional family; and (5) lack of legal protections for sexual minorityparent (SMP) families. Their best parenting experiences included: (1) being role models,leading to a greater acceptance of LGBTQ people; (2) treasuring the LGBTQ parent andfamily community; (3) teaching their children to appreciate diversity of all types; and (4)witnessing their child’s pride in their non-traditional family. Some of these challengeswere anticipated by the parents more than a quarter century ago at the time that theywere inseminating or pregnant with the index offspring.Keywords: lesbian parenting, sexual minority parent families, parent perspectives, thematic perceptions, same-sex parenting, emerging adults, benefits of same-sex parenting, challenges of same-sex parentingINTRODUCTION“In third grade, I overheard <my child> telling his friends, ‘there are three unusual things aboutme: I don’t like chocolate, I don’t eat meat, and I have two moms.’ His friends, horrified, said, ‘YOUDON’T LIKE CHOCOLATE?!”’ recalled a parent in describing her best experiences.Research on sexual minority parents (SMPs) has examined many aspects of parenthood, fromthe decisions they make in planning their families (Gartrell et al., 1996; Goldberg and Sayer, 2006;Goldberg, 2010), to their negotiations concerning the division of labor and parenting roles (Gartrellet al., 1999; Goldberg and Perry-Jenkins, 2007). Studies have reported on their sources of socialsupport, their concerns about homophobic stigmatization, and their feelings about raising childrenwithout fathers or without mothers (Gartrell et al., 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006; Goldberg, 2010). Thereare data on single parents, couple dynamics, and parental relationship dissolution among thoseFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 October 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 2414fpsyg-10-02414 October 25, 2019 Time: 16:49 # 2Gartrell et al. Thematic Perceptions of Lesbian Parentingwho identify as sexual minorities (Gartrell et al., 1996, 1999,2000, 2006, 2011; Goldberg, 2010). Investigators have also askedSMPs about the ways they believe their children might benefitfrom growing up in non-traditional families (Muzio, 1995; Lynchand Murray, 2000). However, there is a gap in the literatureon the experiences of SMPs whose offspring have reachedadulthood. The current study explores the most challenging andbest parenting experiences of SMPs from the time that theirchildren were conceived until they reach adulthood.Sexual minority parenting was established as a field of studyin the 1970s when lesbian mothers began to seek custodyof children they had conceived in heterosexual relationships(Hunter and Polikoff, 1976; Tasker and Golombok, 1997; Tasker,2013; Golombok, 2015). This was a time of considerablesocial, cultural, religious, and legal opposition to non-traditionalfamilies (Goldberg, 2010; Golombok, 2015). In the absence ofempirical data on lesbian-parent families, custody was awardedto the fathers based on assumptions that children rearedby lesbians would develop behavioral problems, demonstrategender non-conformity, experience bullying, and grow up tobe LGBT (Golombok and Tasker, 1996; Tasker and Golombok,1997; Tasker and Patterson, 2008; Tasker, 2013; Golombok,2015). Although the first research on this topic found thatchildren raised in post-divorce lesbian-parent households werecomparable in psychosocial development to those from singleheterosexual-mother families (Green, 1978; Kirkpatrick et al.,1981; Golombok et al., 1983), critics pointed to the lack ofprospective, longitudinal data on children, adolescents, andadults raised since birth by SMPs (Golombok, 2015). This wasthe climate in 1982 when The Sperm Bank of California becamethe first family planning clinic in the United States to offer donorinsemination (DI) to all women, regardless of sexual orientationor marital status (The Sperm Bank of California, 2019).As the news of this clinic made its way around thecountry, lesbian-identified prospective parents began to conceivechildren through DI, forming what are now known as planned(or intentional) lesbian-parent families (Gartrell et al., 1996;Goldberg, 2010; Golombok, 2015). Embarking on this pathsubjected this first generation of parents to criticism from theirfamilies of origin, social and religious communities, and evenother lesbian women who considered the choice to parent a formof “passing” (i.e., increasing the likelihood of appearing to beheterosexual, and thus reducing one’s exposure to homophobicstigmatization), and a sell-out from the struggle for LGBTQcivil rights (Gartrell et al., 1999; Bradford et al., 2013). Atthe time, experts in child development, mental health, law,and public policy commented that the outcome of this newsocial phenomenon would only become fully apparent when thefirst generation of offspring conceived through DI to lesbian-identified parents reached adulthood (Kolata, 1989; Parke, 2004,2013). These offspring have now entered adulthood in substantialnumbers, providing a wealth of opportunity to study their well-being as adults, and to explore their parents’ perspectives on thebold social experiment in which they participated.There is now an extensive body of research on thepsychological well-being of children and adolescents reared inSMP families. These children and adolescents have been foundto fare as well as, or sometimes better than, those raised inmother–father parent families (Gartrell and Bos, 2010). Many ofthese studies were grounded in family systems theory (focusingon factors that influence a child’s growth and development overtime in the context of family relationships; Goldberg, 2010;Farr et al., 2017), minority stress theory (which attributes thestress of homophobic stigmatization to health disparities foundamong sexual minority people; Meyer, 2003), as well as socialconstructionism and queer theory (which emphasize that theconcept of family is subject to interpretation, and view SMPfamilies as a challenge to traditional notions of family, gender,gender relations, and sexuality; Dunne, 2000; Oswald et al., 2005;Stacey, 2006; Goldberg and Perry-Jenkins, 2007; Goldberg, 2010;Farr et al., 2017).Few studies have examined mental health outcomes in adultswho were born into SMP families (Golombok and Badger,2010; Gartrell et al., 2018; Koh et al., 2019). The ongoing U.S.National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study (NLLFS) beganin 1986 with a goal of providing prospective data on thefirst generation of planned lesbian-parent families (Gartrellet al., 1996). In the sixth wave, the index children – allconceived through DI at Wave 1 by lesbian-identified prospectiveparents – were 25 years old. When these adult offspring werecompared with same-age peers from a nationally representativesample, no differences were found in their relationships withfamily, friends, or spouses/partners (Gartrell et al., 2018). Also,there were no significant differences in their educational orjob performance or mental health (including emotional andbehavioral problems). However, NLLFS adult offspring who hadbeen stigmatized in multiple ways because of their parents’sexual orientation and had low scores on meaning in lifewere found to have higher rates of emotional or behavioralproblems than the remaining NLLFS offspring (Bos et al., 2019;Koh et al., 2019).To our knowledge, no prior investigation has explored theperspectives of SMPs on their overall parenting experiencesfrom the time that their children were conceived until theirchildren reached adulthood. This information is essential forfuture generations of SMPs as well as for professionals whomay be consulted by SMP families. The current study aimsto address this gap in the literature. Research suggests thatfirst-generation DI SMPs might express concerns about theways that homophobic stigmatization affected their childrenin the past or present (Gartrell et al., 1996, 1999, 2000,2006; Goldberg, 2010). Drawing from social constructionismand queer theory (Dunne, 2000; Oswald et al., 2005; Stacey,2006; Goldberg and Perry-Jenkins, 2007; Goldberg, 2010;Farr et al., 2017) we predict that SMPs might be proudof the ways that their sexual and gender non-conformityinfluenced cultural concepts of family and parenting in positiveways. The purpose of the current study was to explorethe NLLFS parents’ perspectives on the entirety of theirparenting, at the time when their children were 25 years old.Specifically, this investigation aimed to gain information aboutthe parents’ most challenging and best experiences related toparenting in a non-traditional family since the time that theirchildren were conceived.Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 October 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 2414fpsyg-10-02414 October 25, 2019 Time: 16:49 # 3Gartrell et al. Thematic Perceptions of Lesbian ParentingMATERIALS AND METHODSParticipantsOne hundred and thirty one parents participated in the sixthwave of the U.S. National Longitudinal Family Study – whentheir offspring were 25 years old. At Wave 1 (1986–1992),lesbian-identified prospective parents who were inseminating orpregnant via donor sperm were solicited through advertisementsin newspapers, flyers in women’s bookstores, and leaflets atlesbian events (Gartrell et al., 1996). Interested individuals wereinvited to call the principal investigator. All callers who feltthat they could commit to a longitudinal study of 18+ yearsduration were accepted as participants. This resulted in an initialcohort of 84 families, consisting of 84 prospective birth mothersand 70 prospective co-mothers. All participants were amongthe first generation to conceive through DI in planned lesbianfamilies. After Wave 1, data were collected when the indexoffspring were 2 years old (Wave 2), 5 years old (Wave 3),10 years old (Wave 4), 17 years old (Wave 5), and 25 yearsold (Wave 6; Gartrell et al., 2018). During the sixth wave, 77of the original families were still participating (92% retentionrate). The non-participating parents included those in sevenfamilies who withdrew or were unavailable, and others whowere ill or deceased (from natural causes). For the presentstudy, two families were excluded from the analyses – onebecause the offspring only partially completed the survey, andanother because the offspring was 26 years old at the time ofsurvey completion. Therefore, 75 families, consisting of 69 birthparents, 55 co-parents, and 7 stepparents, were used in thecurrent analyses.ProcedureAfter approval was obtained from Sutter Health InstitutionalReview Board, each NLLFS parent was contacted by email aftertheir offspring reached the age of 25. The email explained thepurpose and procedure of the study, and assured each parentthat participation in the current wave, as in all prior waves, wasentirely voluntary. The measures to ensure confidentiality werealso explained to each potential participant (the survey wouldbe administered through a protected online program). Afterinformed consent was obtained and the survey was completed,each participant received a $60 gift card. Data were collectedbetween 2012 (when the oldest offspring reached the age of 25)until 2017 (when the youngest turned 25; Gartrell et al., 2019).Self-Report MeasuresThe current study focused on two open-ended questions:1. In the past 25 years, what was your most challengingexperience related to being a parent in a non-traditionalfamily?2. In the past 25 years, what was your best experience relatedto being a parent in a non-traditional family?Data AnalysisWith a goal of providing a descriptive account of the participants’most salient overall experiences in non-traditional parenthood,the results were interpreted through thematic analysis (Braun andClarke, 2006). Thematic analysis, which has been used withinmost theoretical frameworks, involves examining the entire dataset for patterns or themes (Braun and Clarke, 2006). The researchquestions formed two major predetermined themes, each ofwhich allowed for the emergence of novel categories from theparticipants’ responses.CodingTwo members of the research team (NG and ER) read eachresponse multiple times. These researchers then discussed themajor themes that appeared in the responses to the tworesearch questions. Subsequently, NG reread the responses eighttimes to create broad descriptive categories that encompassedthe range of experiences reported by the participants. Thesecategories were discussed and refined multiple times by thetwo researchers to create an exclusive coding scheme (onecode for each phrase, sentence, or group of sentences) beforeconducting a practice session. NG and ER then independentlycoded 44 sets of responses, representing 30% of the participants.Their two independently scored sheets were submitted to thestatistical analyst (a third member of the research team, HB),who calculated the Krippendorff ’s alphas: 0.86 for Question 1and 0.92 for Question 2. NG and ER discussed the responsesthat they had coded differently and reconciled those into a singlecode for each response or response segment (phrase, sentence,or group of sentences). Their high level of agreement on theKrippendorff ’s alphas when coding the first 30% of participantresponses made it possible for NG to code the responses ofthe remaining 70%.RESULTSDescriptive StatisticsThe descriptive statistics for the total analytic sample arepresented in Table 1. As can be seen, 96.9% of parents identifiedas female (at Wave 6) and 89.3% as White (at Wave 1). Theiraverage age at Wave 6 was 59.8 ± 4.9 years. Most parents hada college degree or higher (Wave 6; 92.4%).Most Challenging Parenting ExperiencesBased on the participants’ reports, 117 segments were coded.As shown in Table 2, thematic analysis revealed that themost challenging parenting experiences associated with raisingtheir children in non-traditional families fell into five majorcategories: (1) distress about their children’s experiences ofexclusion, heterosexism, or homophobic stigmatization (33.3%);(2) family of origin non-acceptance of their lesbian-parentfamily (16.2%); (3) the never-ending process of “educating theworld about queer parents” (14.5%); (4) homophobia or hostilitytoward their non-traditional family (12.8%); and (5) lack oflegal protections for SMP families (9.4%). Other challengingexperiences included not having the co-mother acknowledged asa parent (6.8%), and dissatisfaction with the known donor’s rolein the family (5.1%).Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 October 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 2414fpsyg-10-02414 October 25, 2019 Time: 16:49 # 4Gartrell et al.

Pat (all names are pseudonyms)described a difficult period for her son: “The most challengingexperience was trying to get him through middle school yearswhen the kids would tease him about having lesbian parents oraccuse him of being gay because of it.” Samantha felt particularlybad about the ways her son was excluded: “[His] best friend hada father who disapproved of us not having a man/husband inthe house. The father would not let his son stay overnight atour house and our son was never invited to his friend’s birthdayparties.” Judith found it challenging “to explain the ignorance ofother people to [her] kids when they were little.” Bee pointed tothe difficulty of “helping <child’s name> to try to understandwhy a friend from a very religious environment was not allowedto come to her 12th birthday party.” Some parents felt sad orTABLE 2 | Most challenging parenting experience.Segmentn %Thematic coding category(1) Distress about their children’s experiences of exclusion,heterosexism, or homophobic stigmatization39 33.3(2) Family of origin non-acceptance of their lesbian-parentfamily19 16.2(3) The never-ending process of “educating the world aboutqueer parents”17 14.5(4) Homophobia or hostility toward their non-traditionalfamily15 12.8(5) Lack of legal protections for SMP families 11 9.4(6) Co-mother not acknowledged as a parent 8 6.8(7) Dissatisfaction with the known donor’s role in the family 6 5.1(8) Other 2 1.7Total 117 100.0hurt when their children were ashamed about their family typeas a result of having been stigmatized. Tanya wrote that it waschallenging when her “son had times when he was embarrassedto have two moms or when he wouldn’t say anything when hisfriends made homophobic remarks in my presence.” One parentdescribed the change in her son’s behavior after they moved froma progressive to a conservative community: “Many of the kids<child’s name> met were not exactly gay-positive, and after a fewnegative experiences he stopped telling his fellow students thathe had two moms.” During the marriage equality debates, manyparents had difficulty protecting their children from homophobicstereotypes. Amelia said that “the hardest part was that ourdaughter was subjected to hearing mean-spirited things abouther own family, also at school, in our community, and in themedia.” Nicola and Jane “were concerned with [their] daughter’swell-being and safety as [they] began to speak out publicly about[their] family and [their] desire to marry.”Family of Origin Non-acceptance of TheirLesbian-Parent FamilyNineteen participants reported that they had been rejectedby their family of origin for choosing to raise a child in alesbian-parent household. Penny wrote, “Just about the time Ibecame pregnant, my. . .brother and his wife became born againChristians. My brother said some very hurtful things to us. Fora couple of years after my son’s birth, we would never allowmy brother and sister-in-law to be alone with him. We didn’tknow if they would kidnap him or make derogatory commentsabout us to him.” Jessica stated, “My greatest difficulty has beenwith my own original family, some of whom have found itnearly impossible to accept me as a lesbian, and as a resultof that, accept my partner and my children as normal. I havetried for years to show up with my family and participate inthe larger circle. But some, I guess because of deep religiousconviction, cannot let us be normal and part of the whole. It’sso disappointing.” Alexandria, a birth mother, stated that her co-parent Rachel had lost custody of a child due to homophobia.Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 October 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 2414fpsyg-10-02414 October 25, 2019 Time: 16:49 # 5Gartrell et al. Thematic Perceptions of Lesbian ParentingRachel’s family of origin had used the legal system to claim thatRachel was unfit to parent because she was a lesbian: “Theywere instrumental in her losing custody of her then 4-year-old daughter because we were a lesbian couple.” Some parentsindicated that their families of origin had been hostile whenthe pregnancy was announced, but eventually came around. Bevdescribed the painful experience of her “parents telling [her]that <child’s name> was not their grandchild. They changedwithin a couple of years and were very loving and proud, butit took some work.” For others, the rejection by the family oforigin never ceased. Kim wrote, “My biological family was/is agreat challenge. They rarely recognize my children for holidays,etc.” Alice stated, “My parents never accepted our kids as theirgrandchildren because they were children of lesbians.” Celia’smother took her homophobia to the grave: “At my mother’s shiva6 years ago, a woman came up to our daughter and said, ‘Iam so glad your mother decided to have you. I remember yourgrandmother and mother had talked about whether she wouldgo through with the pregnancy – I’m so glad she decided to doso.’ My daughter came to me and literally said ‘WTF!’ I explainedthat my mother had told people I was pregnant by accident buthad then decided to have the baby. She told people I was a singleparent when in reality I had been in a lesbian relationship (family)for 25 years.”The Never-Ending Process of “Educating the WorldAbout Queer Parents”Seventeen parents found the necessity of repeatedly havingto explain their family configuration annoying. As Ceciliaput it, “We were among the first non-traditional families, soother parents were not sure what to make of us.” Debbietired of “the relentlessness of having to explain we areboth parents. . .[and] having people ask, ‘What do you knowabout the donor?’ UGH.” One participant mentioned thatthe conversation became even more complex when she andher co-parent split, and her daughter then had two momsand a stepmom: “I did have to talk to every single teacherfor both girls every year to let them know that they hadtwo moms and a stepmom, and that <child’s name> livedin two homes.” Another parent referred to it as the “manymoms” conversation.Homophobia or Hostility Toward Their Non-traditionalFamilyDealing with homophobia or hostility that was directed at theirfamilies was particularly challenging for 15 parents. Some citedearly incidents that were traumatic. Barb stated, “When my sonwas 2 years old, someone I supervised at work organized anattack on me and told everyone I was a lesbian and tried toget me kicked out of my job. Although I didn’t lose my job,this was really scary. I felt a strong sense of being vulnerableas a lesbian mom and remember feeling scared that my soncould be taken away from me. The trauma of that experience,although greatly healed, is still with me.” Cassie wrote thatshe felt that “it was important to be ‘out’ for [her] child, but[she] often felt some fear while doing so.” Several mentionedhomophobic experiences in the medical setting. Valerie hated“having to deal with doctors and hospitals that did not recognize[her] right to parent [her] kids.” Kaye Jean elaborated on onesuch experience: “At <name of hospital>, we walked in theroom to meet the head doctor for the first time. She did notintroduce herself. She immediately yelled, ‘We have to knowabout the father.’ We were shocked by this unprofessionalapproach. I would have expected her to start by asking us fora family medical history.” When her child was very young,Jasmine had to contend with a complaint filed with socialservices by a neighbor: “It was very challenging, but the supportwe got from the pre-school, the pediatrician, other neighborsand friends was incredible.” Several participants described theirefforts to destigmatize SMP families by befriending opponents.Danielle wrote, “There was one mother who was very rude, veryuncomfortable around my wife and I. I chose to volunteer inthe library every week, the same day as this mother. Within6 months. . .she started to talk about being more accepting ofa non-traditional family. She did not know any other lesbianor gay people. I think she just had a preconceived idea (witha little influence from her Catholic upbringing) that we werebad people.” Wendy felt that cultural homophobia contributedto the dissolution of the relationship with her co-parent: “Isometimes wonder if we could have kept our family intact if wehad been a traditional couple. I do see straight couples understress and imagine more social/societal support to stay togetherthan we had.”Lack of Legal Protections for SMP FamiliesEleven participants pointed to the lack of legal protections fortheir families, especially before marriage equality was grantedby the United States Supreme Court. Some of these participantswere litigants in the struggle for co-parent adoption. Marty stated,“<Co-mother’s name> and I were the first <county name>citizens to legally adopt our non-biological children and haveboth our names listed on their birth certificates. At the time, the<state name> only allowed adoptions by a man and a woman.The process was expensive, time-consuming, and sometimesfrustrating.” Silvana described her family’s struggle to obtainmedical insurance for their child before co-parent adoption:“Before we were able to cross-adopt, when <child’s name> wasborn, I argued she should go on my insurance, because she wasmy dependent. After agreeing, this option was withdrawn. Itmade me angry that my parenthood was being written out ofexistence, and anxious because <child’s name> had some seriousmedical problems.” Several mentioned the stress of traveling outof state and the prospect of officials denying the legitimacy oftheir family ties. Roberta wrote about “not being recognizedas a family by the government and always having to be sureyou had all the legal paperwork complete and up-to-date at alltimes.” Sallyanne stated, “We were nervous traveling to Texas,that if something happened, they would take <daughter’s name>since her family was not recognized. It was insulting for mypartner to need to adopt her own child.” Some co-parents,like Pauletta, described being fearful when she broke up withher children’s birth mother “that the courts would [not] honormy role in my children’s lives when we split as I was not thebiological mother.”Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 October 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 2414fpsyg-10-02414 October 25, 2019 Time: 16:49 # 6Gartrell et al.

A few wished that the donor had been moreinvolved in their family life, and others wanted the opposite.Andrea wrote: “Although we have a known donor, I feel very sadthat we rarely see him (every few years at this point), and almostnever unless I initiate.” In contrast, Karen regretted “having tosend [her] child (beginning at 6 months of age) to her father’shome on alternate weekends during the week, and for extendedperiods in the summer.”Best Parenting ExperiencesBased on thematic analysis, 107 segments were coded from theparticipants’ recollections of their best experiences as parents innon-traditional families over the prior 25 years (see Table 3).Four primary categories emerged from these codes: (1) beingrole models, leading to a greater acceptance of LGBTQ people(23.4%); (2) treasuring the LGBTQ parent and family community(21.5%); (3) teaching their children to appreciate diversityof all types (19.6%); and (4) witnessing their child’s pridein their non-traditional family (18.7%). Other themes thatwere associated with best experiences included gaining legalrecognition (9.3%), and having the freedom to parent acrossgender expectations (3.7%).Being Role Models, Leading to Greater Acceptanceof LGBTQ PeopleTwenty-five parents were proud to have shown people in all walksof life how healthy, loving, and supportive SMP families couldbe. They described their delight in witnessing greater acceptanceand recognition of LGBTQ-parent families. Many commentedon their efforts to educate people about their family type. Denistated, “I enjoyed. . .educating other lesbian women who wantedto parent. I liked challenging people’s assumptions about whomakes a good parent and why.” Sondra wrote, “In the beginningit was extremely hard, but as we moved forward, you could seea shift in how people viewed our family. It really was somethingwonderful to see.” Kim reported on a school experience: “I lovedit when our son’s third grade teacher told us how worried shehad been to have lesbians be part of the parents she had to dealwith at the beginning of the school year, and how unnecessarythat worry had been – that we were the best parents in theroom.” Some, like Dale, wrote about “coming out to people inmy work or in my social circles over and over and seeing theirviews change over time, going from either neutral or ignorantto educated and supportive of gay and lesbian parenting.” Someparents mentioned past and present opportunities to mentoryouth. Ann stated, “For straight friends, I have been someonetheir kids could come talk to.” Others were still receiving feedbackabout how helpful they had been. Cassie wrote, “In recent yearswe’ve heard from some of our daughter’s friends – those who aregrown up now and out as gay, lesbian, and trans – that growing upthey looked up to us as role models and that we gave them somehope that everything could work out.” Libby added, “We havebeen able to mentor several lesbians, gays, and transgender youthin our community – those who now know that non-traditionalfamilies can live happy, productive lives, and have children.”Treasuring the LGBTQ Parent and Family CommunityFor 23 parents, the LGBTQ community was a highlight of theirparenting years. Many commented on the important connectionsthey had made during LGBTQ Pride celebrations, family camps,and community events. Francis mentioned that she “feel[s] a deepconnection to the LGBTQ parenting world.” Erin described herfavorite memory: “Blueberry Cove Family Camp, with all kindsof families, and having a week of bliss each summer for manyyears, during which we were just another family that had twowonderful moms and two wonderful sons and many, many good,loving friends to eat with, swim with, write with, play with, andthe kids could be freeeeeee.” Joan’s family still goes to queer familycamp every year: “Camp it Up, a family camp for queer families,we go every summer. It’s an essential recharge each year, to haveour family affirmed and reflected in a safe environment.” Severalparents mentioned Family Week in Provincetown as a specialannual event. Some also included their religious communities assources of support. Marie stated, “We have had a great deal ofsupport and affirmation as a lesbian family in our community –synagogue, family camp, community of friends, and family.”Teaching Their Children to Appreciate Diversity of AllTypesThe best parenting experience for 21 participants involvedteaching their children to appreciate all forms of diversity andunderstand all forms of oppression. Margarita captured thisconcept in her response: “The best experience was helping to raisean incredible son. He is a sensitive, caring, loving, compassionateperson because of the family he was born into, with two greatmothers and two great fathers. All of his parents have done agood job of parenting. Being from a gay family has contributed tohis understanding of all oppressions – racism, sexism, classism,and gay oppression. He has been a great ally to me, particularlyas a woman of color who was raised poor from an immigrantfamily.” Shay wrote of her pride in “watching the ways that bothmy children actively care for the disadvantaged and stand upfor the rights of everyone to equal treatment and opportunity.”Ansley stated, “I always knew from a very young age that anyFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 October 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 2414fpsyg-10-02414 October 25, 2019 Time: 16:49 # 7Gartrell et al. Thematic Perceptions of Lesbian Parentingchildren I brought into this world would be loved, healthy, happy,productive individuals who give back to the world. This hasproved to be 100% true.” Several parents, like Clare, mentionedtheir joy in raising empathic sons: “Being able to raise <child’sname> with an open mind to different ways of living, nurturing[his] ability to be empathic and sensitive to others.” Otherscommented that helping their children appreciate diversityhad the additional benefit of giving them more confidence inthemselves, as Maddy’s response illustrates: “I believe that ourchildren have learned to be accepting of all types of families andpeople in general. From a very young age, they learned to standup for themselves and who they are.” Danny mentioned that shewas very happy in “seeing that our role modeling and communityhelped our kids understand that they could be truly themselves,in whatever way they turned out to be.” She was also gratefulfor “their having an appreciation of otherness and difference thathelped them be more accepting of diversity in others.”Witnessing Their Child’s Pride in Their Non-traditionalFamilyTwenty parents wrote about witnessing their child’s pride intheir non-traditional family. Many described important eventsat which their children spoke or taught others about theirfamily type. Sal commented on an occasion when her young soneducated prospective SMPs: “He and some of his friends spoke ona panel at an event for lesbians considering parenthood. [It] waspretty cool too, how positively he expressed he felt about growingup in a lesbian family.” Jovi described a proud moment whenher son’s essay educated his entire school: “When my son was inelementary school (5th grade), he wrote a paper about why hewas disappointed in the State of California for trying to pass alaw about not allowing same-sex couples to marry (Prop 22). Histeacher thought it was a wonderful paper and asked the principalif he could read it to the entire school during the assembly thatday. So many of the parents came up to us to let us know thathearing his paper had changed their view on their vote. They hadnot thought about how unfair it was to not have the same rightsthat [were] allowed to others.” Francis wrote that her childrenwere invited to be panel participants at an annual event for socialworkers: “They were asked to speak about what it had been likebeing raised by same-gender parents. It felt like an honor.” Othershad children who testified for LGBTQ civil rights. In doing so,Diane stated that her daughter was “very mature and comfortablewith who she was, even at the tender age of 13!” Sue wrote thather son has made it his life’s work to educate the world about hisnon-traditional family: “He is a writer who has taken many ofhis childhood experiences and turned them into entertaining andenlightening stories, some of which he has told on radio programsand in community story-telling programs. I am proud of how hehas learned to reframe his experiences, to take ownership of theout-of-the-mainstream experiences he has had, and to share hisperspective with others through his creativity.”Legal RecognitionFor 10 parents, the highlight of their parenting experiences wasgaining legal recognition through the United States SupremeCourt decisions. Cece was proud of “being involved in theequal marriage litigation as a family.” Sheila wrote that her bestexperience was “getting married because of the legal security forus, but [also] getting married because the children really wantedus to.”Freedom to Parent Across Gender ExpectationsFour parents felt that it was particularly important that they wereable to parent across gender expectations. As Jaime put it, “At ourhouse, there were no real traditional gender roles, so anything wasseen as possible to do. As a result, my daughter is very sensitiveto people saying something like, ‘You can’t do it because you’re_______.”’DISCUSSIONThis study is unique in examining the perspectives of SMPs whosechildren are now emerging adults. These parents were among thefirst generation to conceive children through DI and rear themin planned lesbian families. The parents were participants in thesixth wave of the ongoing NLLFS. They were asked to describetheir most challenging and best experiences as parents in non-traditional families from the time that their children were bornuntil they reached the age of 25 years. Thematic analyses revealedthat the most challenging experiences faced by the NLLFS parentsincluded distress about their children’s experiences of exclusion,heterosexism, or homophobic stigmatization; family of originnon-acceptance of their lesbian-parent family; the never-endingprocess of educating the world about SMPs; homophobia orhostility toward their non-traditional family; and lack of legalprotection for SMPs. The best experiences fell into four maincategories, namely, serving as role models who contributedto a greater acceptance of LGBTQ people, treasuring theLGBTQ parent and family community, teaching their children toappreciate diversity of all types, and witnessing their child’s pridein their non-traditional family.Studies on SMP families in the transition to parenthood or theearly years of childhood (Gartrell et al., 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006;Goldberg and Sayer, 2006; Goldberg, 2010) might have predictedthat even as parents of adult children, the NLLFS participantswould comment on their children’s experiences of homophobicstigmatization. As it turned out, this was the most frequentlymentioned parenting challenge by participants in the currentstudy, and it was anticipated by the NLLFS parents at Wave1 (Gartrell et al., 1996). At that time, the prospective parentsworried that their children could be stigmatized because theyhad been conceived through DI by lesbian-identified women. Inpreparation for helping their children cope with this challenge,61% of prospective parents had formed or joined lesbianparenting groups. After their children were born, the parentswere actively involved in promoting LGBTQ-awareness in theirpre-schools, elementary schools, social groups, and communityactivities (Gartrell et al., 1999, 2000). The NLLFS parents feltthat exposure to all types of diversity was essential to protectingtheir children from homophobia (Gartrell et al., 1999), and manyparents taught their children healthy responses to harassment(Gartrell et al., 2005). Since that time, studies have found thatFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 October 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 2414fpsyg-10-02414 October 25, 2019 Time: 16:49 # 8Gartrell et al. Thematic Perceptions of Lesbian Parentingpromoting awareness of diversity and preparing for the prospectof discrimination are important aspects of cultural socializationfor non-majority children (Hughes et al., 2006; Oakley et al.,2017). When the NLLFS offspring were 10 years old, 43%reported that they had experienced discrimination based ontheir family type, and nearly 40% spoke out about it, tellingpeers that they were “wrong” or “not nice” for making hostile,homophobic comments (Gartrell et al., 2005). The negativeimpact of homophobia on the psychological well-being of theNLLFS offspring who experienced it was moderated (or lessened)for 10-year-olds who attended schools with LGBTQ curriculaand had parents who participated in the lesbian community(Bos et al., 2008); for 17-year-olds, by having close, positiverelationships with their parents (Bos and Gartrell, 2010); and for25-year-olds who had found meaning in life (Bos et al., 2019).In the current study, for many NLLFS parents, rejection bytheir family of origin was still a salient memory. At Wave 1,15% of participants expected that no family member wouldacknowledge their child because of their own lesbian identity(Gartrell et al., 1996). However, by the time the index offspringwere 10 years old, most families of origin had embraced thesechildren and treated them no differently than any other familymembers (Gartrell et al., 2006). Also, nearly three-quartersof grandparents were “out” about their grandchild’s SMPs.Nevertheless, some parents in the current study had familymembers who never accepted the index offspring or the SMPfamily in which they were raised.Educating others about non-traditional families was a never-ending process for many parents in the first generation oflesbian-identified women to conceive children through DI. Whentheir children were young, these parents had to contend withconsiderable cultural and institutional homophobia (Gartrellet al., 1996; Tasker and Patterson, 2008; Goldberg, 2010; Bradfordet al., 2013; Golombok, 2015). The struggle to create a safepath for their children was at times arduous, according toparent reports across the six waves of the NLLFS (Gartrellet al., 1996, 1999, 2000, 2005). For example, whenever theirchildren changed schools, joined an athletic team, or enrolled incommunity theater, the parents had to come out to a new group offamilies, teachers, coaches, or instructors. This meant monitoringto ensure that their children were not stigmatized, and ifthey were, working to promote acceptance of non-traditionalfamilies. In two-mother families, there was an ongoing effortto ensure that both parents were acknowledged as legitimate.In order to do so, many parents in this first generation helpedforge the legal protections that SMPs now enjoy. All in all,first-generation SMPs contributed to cultural and institutionalchanges in the acceptance of non-traditional families in ways thatcould not have been anticipated when they first embarked on thepath to parenthood.A quarter century after this bold experiment began (Parke,2004, 2013), the NLLFS parents were proud of their role inpromoting greater acceptance of LGBTQ people. In line withsocial constructionism and queer theory, their best parentingexperiences included challenging heterosexual norms aboutsexuality and gender (Oswald et al., 2005) and what it meansto be a family (Dunne, 2000; Oswald et al., 2005; Stacey, 2006).They described special memories of joyful celebrations andconnections with the LGBTQ parent and family community.They appreciated that their adult children welcomed diversity,were unrestricted by gender stereotypes, and continued toeducate their own peers about non-traditional families.Strengths, Limitations, and FutureDirectionsA strength of the current study is that the data were drawnfrom the largest and longest-running, ongoing, longitudinalinvestigation of SMPs. Because the NLLFS is a prospectiveinvestigation, the findings from the current study are notbiased by overrepresentation of parents who volunteered toparticipate when they already knew that their families andchildren were doing well.There are also limitations that must be noted. The NLLFS isa non-representative sample. The parents enrolled at a time inhistory when most LGBTQ people were closeted, and recruitinga population-based sample was unrealistic. In addition, theparticipants were mostly White and highly educated. For thesereasons, the results may not be generalizable to the population ofSMPs as a whole.Future prospective, longitudinal studies would benefit fromlarger, more diverse, and representative samples of parents whoidentify as LGBTQ, for whom children entered the family unitthrough DI, fostering, adoption, stepparenting, and surrogacy.These samples would allow for an intersectional approach toexplore the parenting experiences of a wide array of sexualand gender minority people, including those who have multipleminority status, in the post-marriage equality era. Because thecurrent study asked parents to reflect on their experiences over a25-year period, some reported on past and some on recent events.Research is needed to assess whether societal and cultural changesduring this period of time have created more of a welcomingenvironment for newly forming SMP families, or whether thesechanges are only affecting those who reside in more progressivecommunities or countries.Our findings provide implications for practice. Healthprofessionals, educators, and social service agents should beattentive to the prospect that SMPs and their children may besubjected to homophobic discrimination from many sources –families of origin, medical and mental health professionals,teachers, peers, and colleagues. Clinicians should be preparedto help SMPs and their families manage the stress of comingout over and over, sometimes to individuals who may behostile. Clinicians and educators should also understand theimportance of preparing the children of SMPs for the prospectof stigmatization. SMPs should work with the school systems todesign or improve anti-bullying programs, and to ensure that theeducational curricula provide information on all types of families(Gartrell et al., 1999, 2000, 2005; Hughes et al., 2006; Oakleyet al., 2017). In addition, professionals should be fully informedabout the favorable outcomes and protective factors for childrenreared in SMP families (Bos et al., 2008, 2019; Bos and Gartrell,2010) so that they can share this information with prospectiveor struggling parents. Despite the many challenges faced by theFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 October 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 2414fpsyg-10-02414 October 25, 2019 Time: 16:49 # 9Gartrell et al. Thematic Perceptions of Lesbian Parentingfirst generation of SMPs who conceived through DI, their adultchildren are faring very well (Golombok and Badger, 2010;Gartrell et al., 2018).CONCLUSIONTo our knowledge, this is the only study to have surveyed SMPsabout their most challenging and best parenting experiencesfrom the time that their children were conceived until theybecame 25-year-old adults. The results revealed that distressover their children’s and family’s experiences of homophobicstigmatization, family of origin non-acceptance of their lesbian-parent family, the never-ending process of educating peopleabout non-traditional families, and lack of legal protections forSMPs families were the most challenging experiences recalledby the participating parents. On the positive side, the parentswere proud that they had contributed to the greater acceptanceof SMP families, and that they had taught their children towelcome diversity. They treasured their memories of connectingwith the LGBTQ parent and family community, and witnessingtheir children speak publicly and favorably about their non-traditional family.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this manuscript willbe made available by the authors, without undue reservation, toany qualified researcher.ETHICS STATEMENTThe studies involving human participants were reviewed andapproved by Sutter Health Institutional Review Board.

    "abstract": "In the sixth wave of the U.S. National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study (NLLFS), when their offspring were 25 years old, the parents were asked to reflect on their most challenging and best experiences raising children in non-traditional families. The responses of 131 parents were interpreted through thematic analysis. The most challenging parenting experiences fell into five major categories: (1) distress about their children’s experiences of exclusion, heterosexism, or homophobic stigmatization; (2) family of origin non-acceptance of their lesbian-parent family; (3) the never-ending process of “educating the world about queer parents”; (4) homophobia or hostility toward their non-traditional family; and (5) lack of legal protections for sexual minority parent (SMP) families. Their best parenting experiences included: (1) being role models, leading to a greater acceptance of LGBTQ people; (2) treasuring the LGBTQ parent and family community; (3) teaching their children to appreciate diversity of all types; and (4) witnessing their child’s pride in their non-traditional family. Some of these challenges were anticipated by the parents more than a quarter century ago at the time that they were inseminating or pregnant with the index offspring",
