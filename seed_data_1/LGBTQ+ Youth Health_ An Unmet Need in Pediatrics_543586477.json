IntroductionAt present, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex people (LGBTQ+) areincreasingly being empowered to freely express themselves, particularly young people andrising generations [1]. It is evaluated that the proportion of sexual and gender minorities(SGM) in the entire population stands at around 3.8% [2]. National surveys conducted inthe United States (US) in 2020 estimated that almost 9% of adolescents between 13 and17 years of age recognize themselves to be lesbian, gay or bisexual, and 0.73% identifyas transgender, although a higher prevalence is possible [3]. Regarding the populationbetween ages 9 and 12 years, it has been shown that approximately 1%–3% identify asgay or lesbian, 3%–5% identify as bisexual, and 1%–5% are unsure about their sexualorientation [4]. Italy still lacks data on sexual identity and orientation among adolescents.The latest ISTAT census in 2011 showed that 2.4% of the population self-identify as SGM,especially among young people, but no mention was made of the population under 18 yearsof age [5].Although data underline the trend of more open expression of different sexual orien-tations and gender identities, LGBTQ+ adolescents still suffer discrimination in the healthcare framework. Inclusive care by providers to look after their health is needed. [6–10].Pediatricians are often the first physicians in the health care system to care for LGBTQ+adolescents facing their sexual and gender identities. Unfortunately, as shown by severalChildren 2022, 9, 1027. https://doi.org/10.3390/children9071027 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/childrenChildren 2022, 9, 1027 2 of 11authors, pediatricians have insufficient knowledge of LGBTQ+ issues [11–14], which keepsthem from fulfilling the specific needs of their patients. The purpose of this review is toframe LGBTQ+ youths’ lives, including risks, difficulties and needs, that pediatriciansshould investigate and meet to provide these youth with better and more individualizedassistance regarding their health. This is a narrative review of the literature on LGBTQ+youths’ care in pediatrics, carried out by the Pediatric Clinic at the University of Parma,Parma, Italy. Systematic searches were performed in PubMed up until March 2022. Thelanguage was restricted to English. Search terms included “LGBTQ”, “LGBTQ+”, “Trans-gender”, “Gender Non-conforming”, “Non-Binary” and “Health” in combination withthe words adolescents, children and/or youth. Original research studies, review articles,letters to the editor and cohort studies published between 2010 and 2022 were included.Data from earlier studies were taken into account if relevant to the scope of this review. Allrelevant articles were then evaluated, and pertinent articles were included in this review.Since LGBTQ-related glossary is fluid and may be subject to change from time to time,Table 1 provides an overview of terms to serve as a guide for this review. This represents astarting point for discussion because terms and definitions are evolving and changing andcan have different meanings to different people within the LGBTQ+ community.Table 1.

Gender IdentityGender identity represents a personal inner concept of self as male, female, both orneither. It is the perception of themselves and what/how they define themselves [15–18].It usually develops in early childhood, through a dynamic process from childhood toadolescence and adulthood, so the gender identity of a pre-pubertal child may also changelater in life [15]. Conversely, the gender identity developed during puberty likely anticipatesthe adult gender identity [16]. Gender identity and related expressions differentiate fromsexual orientation [17], which is the inherent sentimental or sexual attraction to otherindividuals, independent of one’s gender identity [18].Transgender youth, in some but not all cases, may pursue gender-affirming therapiessuch as hormonal therapy and surgery. The risks and benefits of these treatments have beenextensively studied in adults, whereas studies in adolescents are scarce [19,20]. For a longtime, children and adolescents suffering from gender dysphoria were offered psychothera-peutic treatments with the aim of making them identify with their sex assigned at birth.These therapeutic efforts have been demonstrated not to work [21]. The use of hormonaltherapies in transgender minors commenced in the 1980s in the Netherlands. Currently,gender-affirming interventions in transgender adolescents are conceptualized in three steps:puberty suppression, gender-affirming hormones and gender-affirming surgery. Severalguidelines are now available and help clinicians in the decision-making process with a focuson the age at which these young individuals are likely to properly understand and consentto these treatments [22–24]. According to the Endocrine Society, before starting hormonaltherapy, a qualified mental health practitioner must confirm the presence of persistentgender dysphoria and that the adolescent has a stable social and medical environment [22].Moreover, a pediatric endocrinologist must exclude medical contraindications.With regards to gender-affirming surgery, it is usually performed when the individualis 18 years old or older. It may consist of bilateral mastectomy and phalloplasty in trans-gender men whereas transgender women may undergo facial feminization procedures andvaginoplasty. It is important to highlight that gender-affirming therapies in transgenderyouth are associated with mental health benefits and a better quality of life [25].Gender identity development in children born with differences in sex development(DSD) is another major issue. There is no consensus among the scientific communityabout the correct timing for sex-assignment surgery in individuals with DSD since theycould develop a different gender identity after adolescence [26–28]. The assumption thatsex-assignment surgery will guide a child’s future gender identity has been demonstratedto be wrong [29,30]. Therefore, a more prudent approach will be to let the eventual stablegender identity in a child or adolescent with DSD guide and determine the sex assignment.3. Home and FamilyLGBTQ+ adolescents may experience conflict within the context of home, parentingand family. Parental awareness of their child’s gender identification and an evaluationof their support should be one of the first steps of a pediatrician when caring for anadolescent [15]. In their cross-sectional survey conducted among 733 LGBTQ+ youthaged 13–21 years, Hoffman et al. highlighted how responders cite family issues as criticalworries to discuss with physicians [31]. When families accept LGBTQ+ members, their lifesatisfaction improves and depressive symptoms decrease [32,33]. Their sexual practicesbecome safer too; Wilson EC et al. showed a positive association between condom use andparental support among transgender female adolescents [34].The family rejection that LGBTQ+ individuals may experience could lead them to seekapproval, sharing and love from chosen families. A chosen family is a group of people whoare emotionally close to one another and consider each other family without any biologicalor legal bonds [35]. There is still a lack of data about this topic as it relates to pediatrics, butin a recent study conducted on an adult population, Levin et al. reported the experience ofTish, a nonbinary person who identifies as pansexual who met a chosen family for the firsttime when as a teenager and no longer keeps a relationship with the biological family [36].Children 2022, 9, 1027 4 of 11Zelin et al. underlined how 45% of pediatric residents may still lack knowledge aboutsexuality and gender identity among the younger population and 6% would still be afraidof hurting their parents with conversations focused on sexuality and gender identity [37].In addition, Kitts et al. found that only 29% of pediatric providers routinely approachtopics about sexual orientation and only 8.5% approach topics about gender identity withsexually active adolescents [12].As already emphasized, it is crucial for medical providers to share a message of safetyand inclusion with patients and their families [38]. A pediatrician should allow all thefamily members to freely express their feelings and their thoughts, finding time and spaceto engage in a conversation with the patient and the family one at a time. Gender-affirmingterminology and interventions should be explained to families, including helping them toconnect with supportive organizations. It can be normal for family members to be anxiousabout their children, particularly because of societal discrimination and stigma, giventheir different way of expressing or feeling about themselves [38]. Some families may feelinsecure about their child’s future, others may not be inclusive due to personal values, andothers may experience loneliness and sadness [39].Medical providers should stay calm and non-judgmental, and promote private dis-cussions about fears and feelings to facilitate communication between all family actors.Misinformation obtained from the internet, social media, confidants or others should be in-vestigated, and the lack of information should be overcome by providing education throughresearch articles and websites, LGBTQ+ organizations, and discussions on gender-affirmingmedical and non-medical interventions for youth that experience gender dysphoria [39].4. School and BullyingSchool is a critical social environment for youth. LGBTQ+ students have increasedrisk for bullying at school in comparison with their non-LGBTQ+ peers (34.2% vs. 18.8%,respectively) [4,40]. In a 2018 regression analysis, Baams showed that lesbian, gay, bisexualand questioning adolescents presented profiles characterized by polyvictimization andpsychological and/or physical abuse with a higher frequency than profiles without adver-sity [41]. Youth who are bullied over and over again by peers experience several problems:they may internalize verbal and physical abuse by blaming themselves; they may developanxiety and depression; or they may suffer from stomachaches and headaches, or otherpsychosomatic conditions [42,43]. Bullied gender non-conforming adolescents are also at ahigher risk of drug abuse [40]; moreover, LGBTQ+ bullying effects last into adulthood [44].It is well suggested in recent research that bullying based on stigma is more closely tiedto health problems than bullying in general [45]. Additionally, a 2019 American studypublished in the Journal of Adolescent Health shows that LGBTQ-inclusive sex educa-tion correlates with a lower rate of school-based victimization and adverse mental health,demonstrating that inclusive sex education may enhance school climate and psychophysi-cal health for youth [46]. In fact, when antibullying policies, including sexual orientationpolicies, are provided in schools, LGBTQ+ youths have a lower risk of suicide attempts [47].5. Sexual Health and EducationAsking questions about and counseling on items related to sexual and reproductivehealth, including sexual orientation/behavior and gender identity, are essential. Somestudies have shown that LGBTQ+ young individuals face dangerous early sexual expe-riences to a greater extent than their heterosexual peers (65.5% vs. 35.8%), including ahigher risk of having sex with unknown partners, having sex while abusing drugs, havingunprotected sex during their last intercourse, and not undergoing tests for sexually trans-mitted infections (STIs) [4,48–50]. This also seems to be related to poor inclusive sexualeducation. Renold et al. highlighted that, in the United Kingdom, less than 20% of LGBTQ+adolescents received sex education related to LGBTQ+ issues [51]. In a survey conductedin 2017, transgender students declared having sexual intercourse before turning 13 yearsold, having four or more sexual partners, using drugs or alcohol before sex, and usingChildren 2022, 9, 1027 5 of 11fewer condoms (than cisgender students) [52]. Ristori et al. recruited 50 Italian transgenderadolescents aged 11–18 years in a cross-sectional study to explore the experiences of theseItalian TGN youth in relation to sexual matters. Their research showed a direct correlationbetween having sexual intercourse before the age of 14 and smoke/drug consumption, thusunderling how a negative sexual (and health) outcome could be prevented by improvinggender-inclusive sexual education [53]. In Italy, both parents and school providers stillexperience difficulty in addressing sex education in adolescents [54]; therefore, the ItalianNational Institute of Health has recently affirmed that a National Plan for sexual healthpromotion and STI prevention is needed [55]. In view of this, pediatricians should screenfor STIs among LGBTQ+ youths in order to reduce patient morbidity and to prevent HIVand/or secondary STI transmission [56]. It has been shown that adolescent men whohave sex with men (MSM) present increased rates of gonorrhea, C. trachomatis and syphiliscompared to their heterosexual peers [57]. Similarly, the HIV infection rate is higher; in2010, in the US, youth ages 13–29 represented 26% of all new infections, particularly amongyoung MSM [56,58]. Adolescents symptomatic with fever from unknown origins or from amononucleosis-like syndrome, or with previous high-risk exposure to an STI should beinvestigated for acute HIV infection (AHI) as 50%–89% of patients with AHI generally man-ifest symptoms such as fever, sore throat, rash, lymphadenopathy, mucocutaneous ulcersor muscular pain [59]. In 2018, as a response to the expanding urgency to prevent HIVtransmission among youth, a fixed-dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate withemtricitabine was approved in the US as an oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIVin adolescents; in 2019, tenofovir alafenamide with emtricitabine was also approved [60,61];however, data show that only 1.5% of the adolescents at risk for HIV have been prescribedPrEP versus 10% of adults [62,63].Recent US data showed that, in 2018, the national Chlamydia and gonorrhea infectionrates for ages 15–19 were 2.11% and 0.4%, respectively [64]. Data related to sexual partnerswere not reported, but previous studies showed that C. trachomatis infection was highlyprevalent also among screened adolescent MSM, with rectal infection from C. trachomatisreported as 3–10.5% and pharyngeal infection reported as 0.5–2.3% [65,66].Human papilloma virus (HPV) is also common among LGBTQ+ youths, thereforecausing anogenital warts, and cervical and anal dysplasia [56]. It has been evaluatedthat serotypes 6 and 11 are responsible for 90% of non malignant lesions [67], whereasserotypes 16–18 are mainly responsible for cervical and anal dysplasia. The risk of theprogression of cervical and anal dysplasia in adolescents increases when associated withHIV, multiple sexual partners and the presence of external warts [68]. For immunization,a nine-valent HPV vaccine is available and recommended for all young individuals (forgirls ages 11–26 and for boys age 11–21) [69].As Wood et al. underlined, it is also relevant to consider that an increased number ofsexual partners/sex is not necessarily the main reason for high STI frequency in the infectionrate of LGBTQ+ youths. For MSM, the anatomy and immunology of the rectal mucosa led toa greater susceptibility to STIs and HIV [56]. When collecting a sexual anamnesis, pediatricproviders should avoid every type of judgment and opt for using inclusive language,choosing gender-neutral communication and considering that sexual practices do notnecessarily depend on sexual orientation ( e.g., both homosexuals and heterosexuals canperform anal sex) [70]. Before performing a physical examination, especially of the genitals,it is important to assess the comfort level of the patient with respect to sensitive phasesof the examination. TGNs may feel great discomfort if they still have their natal sexualanatomy; therefore, always discuss every phase of the examination with the patient [56].Table 2 summarizes the main sexually transmitted infections in LGBTQ+ youths.Children 2022, 9, 1027 6 of 11Table 2.

COVID-19 and LGBTQ+ YouthsIn the last two years, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2)pandemichas impacted social and health systems worldwide. It has clearly been shownhow deeply COVID-19 negatively impacted youth’s psychological well-being globally [71],but a lack of information about LGBTQ+ youths has been collected. In a recent paper,Ormiston et al. highlighted the expected deeply negative effects of the pandemic onLGBTQ+ youths’ health, reporting that health policies such as lockdowns and schoolclosures with remote learning are likely to worsen the dangers of depression, suicide, drugsabuse and anxiety [72]. It has been reported that more than 50% of SGM young peoplein the US have experienced increased anxiety or depressive symptoms since the start ofthe COVID-19 crisis due to isolation from support systems, lack of family endorsementand limited access to health care services [73–76]. In their study, Fish et al. evaluated812 COVID-19-related content pages of chat-based support groups for LGBTQ+ youths(ages 13–19) during the pandemic. They report how LGBTQ+ youths appeared to beworried about “being stuck at home with unsupportive parents”; locked up with parentsdescribed as super religious and homophobic; and unable to freely express themselves or toaccess friends, gender and sexuality alliances and supportive staff [77]. Data collected froma cohort of 1031 young people living in the US between November 2020 and December2020 showed that for 71.5% of SGM youth, the pandemic affected their mental wellness “alot”, compared to 42.2% of their heterosexual peers [78].It has also been evaluated that LGBTQ+ people present a greater risk of developing se-vere COVID-19 due to poorer health care services related to stigma and discrimination [79].Interestingly, data collected on the adult population showed a higher COVID-19 vaccinationrate among LGBTQ+ individuals than heterosexual individuals (85.4% vs. 76.3%) [80].7. The Role of the PediatricianSince 1973, homosexuality has been removed as a psychiatric disorder in the DSM.Despite this, misperception and faults are still widespread among health providers, includ-ing pediatricians. As Lena et al. observed, pediatricians often show a scarcity of ability toapproach LGBTQ+ youth-related topics due to lack of knowledge (47%) and fear of beingoffensive towards parents or children (32%); 5% believe that “it is inappropriate at thisage” [81]. In a later study, 45% of pediatric residents declared having a lack of knowledge;25% declared not knowing how to ask about sexual orientation; 15% and 6% declaredChildren 2022, 9, 1027 7 of 11being offensive to patients and parents, respectively; and 10% believed that ”discussionis inappropriate given the age” [37]. Pediatricians take charge of their patients’ healthfrom birth to adolescence, which means they face a crucial time when patients self-identifyfrom a sexual and gender point of view. A recent American Academy of Pediatrics policystatement on transgender youth care highlighted that children who later identified as transand non-binary declared having felt their gender was ‘different’ at age 8.5 years of age, onaverage, despite the fact that most did not reveal these feelings until adulthood [46]. Apediatrician should talk with adolescents about their sexual behavior, if possible, not inthe presence of the parents [82–84]. Meckler et al. showed that 33% of adolescents did notreveal their sexual orientation just because no corresponding question was asked by theirdoctor [85]. It has been observed that LGBTQ+ youths would rather benefit from spacesand support especially designed for LGBTQ+ individuals [86]. A first imperative measurewould be creating an environment that promote LGBTQ+ youths to feel confident withrevealing their sexuality and gender identity. This would allow pediatricians to provideprecise, potentially needed lifesaving supports, including gender-affirming treatments forTGN youth, mental health care and family involvement [87]. Pediatricians may build amore inclusive interaction with adolescents by escaping questions that presuppose the gen-der of the patient’s partners and investigating the favored gender pronoun to be used (i.e.,he/him, she/her or they/them) [8]. Conversations about sexual orientation and genderidentity should always be safeguarded, considering that some adolescents may not havetalked about the topic with parents or other people. For bullying concerns, pediatricianscan instruct parents and children about how to recognize youth experiencing LGBTQ+bullying by investigating signs of depression, anxiety, shame and isolation [8]. Inclusivesex education may be provided by pediatric care workers, which can prevent prematuresex and sexual risk-taking, and increase condom use [88,89].Pediatricians should definitively play a leading role in advocating and caring forLGBTQ+ youths and families. Table 3 summarizes the most recent resources and recom-mendations available for supporting the LGBTQ+ community.8. ConclusionsPediatricians have limited knowledge about and comfort with many items regardingthe care of LGBTQ+ youths. The present review supports the necessity for greater con-sciousness and knowledge of the specific and exclusive needs of LGBTQ+ adolescents,including dedicated pediatric LGBTQ+ health training. This would provide the opportunityto forward an inclusive health care system, thus reducing risks related to stigma, bullyingand family rejection and promoting sex education. Physicians can set the tone of comfortby framing three basic principles of care when approaching a patient: non-judgmentalcontact, respect and honesty [90]. Our findings suggest the urgency of specific training forpediatric residents and pediatricians in terms of LGBTQ+ care, including how to talk aboutsexual orientation, sexual attraction, and gender identity while taking a sexual anamnesisfrom a sexually active adolescent; how to identify specific risks such as depression, suicidalthoughts, transmitted sexual infections; and how to support LGBTQ+ parents and families.Table 3.

More studies should be performed inorder to better estimate the prevalence of LGBTQ+ youths in Italy and in Europe. We alsostill lack information about gender-based medicine in pediatrics. Further efforts shouldbe directed toward deeply investigating these items in childhood, even focusing on howto care for transgender and non-binary youths when treating birth-assigned sex-relateddiseases. More attention should also be directed to the effects of COVID-19 on the popula-tion of LGBTQ+ youths due to the increased risks of psychosocial suffering, isolation andmental diseases.Author Contributions: P.D. wrote the first draft of the manuscript and performed the literaturereview; S.E. supervised the project, gave a scientific contribution and critically revised the manuscript.All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.Funding: This research received no external funding.Institutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.Informed Consent Statement: Not applicable.Data Availability Statement: Not applicable.Conflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.References1.

    "abstract": "At present, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex people (LGBTQ+) are increasingly being empowered to freely express themselves, particularly young people and rising generations. Although data underline the trend of more open expression of different sexual orientations and gender identities, LGBTQ+ adolescents still suffer discrimination in the health care framework. Inclusive care by providers to look after the health of LGBTQ+ indiviuals is needed. Pediatricians are often the first health care providers for LGBTQ+ youth facing their sexual and gender identities. Unfortunately, pediatricians have limited knowledge about LGBTQ+ issues, which keeps them from fulfilling the specific needs of LGBTQ+ youth. The purpose of this review is to frame the most important aspects of LGBTQ+ youths' lives, including risks, difficulties and needs, that pediatricians should investigate and meet to provide these youth with better and more individualizedassistance regarding their health. A literature analysis showed that pediatricians have insufficient knowledge of and comfort with several items regarding the management of LGBTQ+ youths. Increased awareness and knowledge of the specific and exclusive needs of LGBTQ+ adolescents are mandatory, including dedicated pediatric LGBTQ+ health care training. This would give them the opportunity to forward an inclusive health care system, thus reducing the risks related to stigma, bullying and family rejection and promoting sex education. Further studies are needed to better evaluate the prevalence of LGBTQ+ youths, gender-based medicine in pediatrics and the effects of COVID-19 on the LGBTQ+ younth population due to increased risks of psychosocial suffering, isolation and mental diseases",
