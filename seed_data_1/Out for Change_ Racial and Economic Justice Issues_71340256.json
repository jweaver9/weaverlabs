Community organizing on these issues spanscenturies and includes many demands for change—from civil rightsto fair wages, immigrants’ rights to education reform, environmentaljustice to native sovereignty. Considerable infrastructure for progres-sive social action in relation to racial and economic justice is inplace. Along with resource organizations, communications tools andother supportive apparatus, the experience and ongoing commitmentof seasoned activists and organizations have been, and continue tobe, key assets for movement building.Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have long been involved in efforts forracial and economic justice. Today, LGBT organizers and groups are increasinglydrawing connections between the movement for LGBT rights and the movement foreconomic and racial justice, noting that people have multiple, layered identities andare members of more than one community at the same time, simultaneously experi-encing oppression and privilege. Progressive organizers have aimed to address the manner in which racism, sexism,class oppression and other systems of discrimination create inequalities that struc-ture the relative positions of LGBT people. Many of them are incorporating intotheir work the specific historical, social and political contexts that create unique andmultifaceted individual experiences. In addition to homophobia, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people confrontracism and poverty on a daily basis. Low-income and LGBT people of color are particularly marginalized and vulnerable within both the LGBT community and thebroader society. They face multiple oppressions and a range of issues including the erosion of public benefits and the dismantling of welfare; lack of affordable housingand homelessness; employment discrimination; immigration restrictions; labor issuesand workers’ rights; violence; incarceration and involvement with the criminal jus-tice system; and environmental racism. Many LGBT organizations have primarily focused—often out of necessity—onsecuring non-discrimination protections, basic inclusion in civil rights measures, andremedies for discriminatory acts. Many of these efforts have met with great success.For example, in 2003 the U.S. Supreme Court, in Lawrence v. Texas, overturnedWe can agitate the rightquestions by probing at the contradictions…~Bayard Rustin1Introduction4existing sodomy laws and spoke ofaffording dignity and respect to same-sex couples. Meanwhile, inMassachusetts, the state SupremeCourt ruled the banning of gay mar-riage unconstitutional. In neighboringCanada, same-sex marriage was legal-ized. Despite these gains, which surelycontribute to reducing discrimination,there remain many major legal, social,economic and racial barriers toachieving full equality for all LGBT people.In addressing the range of issues affecting LGBT lives, several LGBT organizationsare systematically studying, analyzing, acknowledging and addressing economic andracial disparities within the LGBT community. There is, however, much research andpublic education to be done to continue to address how these inequalities affectLGBT people. Increasingly, national, regional and local grassroots LGBT and allied organizationsare operating within a racial and economic justice framework. They are makingimportant connections that address issues of economic class and racial justice asthey affect both the power structure of U.S. society and the civil rights movement.This publication will spotlight many of these organizations and their critical work toachieve social justice for all people.Neither a comprehensive history nor a complete survey of organizing efforts, theaim of this report is threefold: n to identify the range and complexity of issues faced by low-income LGBT peopleand LGBT people of color;n to identify LGBT organizations that are working primarily on racial andeconomic justice issues;n and to identify foundations that are supporting this work and makerecommendations to expand that funding base. This report highlights a number of issues facing LGBT communities, as well asexisting organizing efforts among LGBT groups that effectively address racial andeconomic justice matters. There is a pressing need for greater financial resources tosupport these important community organizing efforts.Increasingly, national,regional and local grassroots organizationsare operating within aracial and economic justice framework.211 Bayard Rustin, From Protest to Politics: The Future of the Civil Rights Movement (NewYork: Bayard Rustin Fund; orig. pub. in Commentary, February, 1965).2 Badgett, M.V.

In her 1998 report, Income Inflation: The Myth of Affluence Among Gay, Lesbian,and Bisexual Americans, economist Lee Badgett notes that LGBT people do notearn more than heterosexual people. Badgett points to the diversity of economic lifeamong LGBT populations, observing that in many cases, LGBT people earn lessthan their heterosexual counterparts.4In her findings, Badgett specifically notes two studies that suggest that gay menearn less than similarly qualified heterosexual men, which strongly suggests theinfluence of workplace discrimination. Lesbian households often make much lessthan comparable gay male or heterosexual households. Gay, lesbian and bisexual people are found throughout the spectrum of income distribution: some are poor, a few are rich and most are somewhere in the middle, along with most heterosexual people.5Overview:Poverty and Economic Reality in LGBT CommunitiesQUEERS FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE, New York, NYwww.queersforeconomicjustice.orgQueers for Economic Justice works to challenge and change the systems that createpoverty and economic injustice and to promote an economic system that embracessexual and gender diversity. QEJ is committed to the principle that access to socialand economic resources is a fundamental right and works to create social and eco-nomic equity through grassroots organizing, public education, advocacy andresearch. QEJ conducts trainings for LGBT homeless shelter residents, organizes for housing,employment, education and healthcare for homeless and low-income youths, and holdscoalition meetings bringing together LGBT organizations with anti-poverty organizations. The Open Society Institute has supported QEJ’s organizing work.Promising Practices Gay, lesbian andbisexual people arefound throughout thespectrum of income distribution: some arepoor, a few are richand most are some-where in the middle,along with most heterosexual people. 6Far from being concentrated at the high-income end, a significant number of LGBTpeople are clustered at the lower end of income distribution. Gay, lesbian, bisexual,and transgender persons are not, as a group, wealthier than heterosexuals and yetthe myth prevails despite the fact that a number of LGBT groups are working todraw the connections between economic justice issues in the context of LGBTissues.6Moreover, LGBT people of color are very likely to earn less than white LGBTpeople. Recent studies utilize data from the 2000 U.S. Census to provide crucialinformation on LGBT communities of color. The studies are noteworthy, despite thelimitations of utilizing census data that only report same-sex households, becausepeople of color in general, and LGBT people of color in particular, are oftenoverlooked or ignored by researchers.   n African American female same-sex households reported a median income of$18,000 less than their white female counterparts; African American malesame-sex households reported a median income of $20,000 less than whitemale same-sex couples.7n A study analyzing census data for Latino/a same-sex households in Florida—where the largest population of Latino/a same-sex households is concentrated—showed that the male and female same-sex households in which both partnersare Latino/a earn far less than their white same-sex counterparts: $23,000 lessfor Latina same-sex households and $17,500 for Latino same-sex partners.8n Household income of less than $25,000 a year was more common among Asiansame-sex partners than among non-Asian gay and lesbian partners, reaching17% in New York and Los Angeles.9SYLVIA RIVERA LAW PROJECT, New York, NYwww.srlp.orgNamed after civil rights pioneer Sylvia Rivera, the Law Project works to increase the political presence of the transgender community. SRLP was founded on the understanding that gender self-determination is inextricablyintertwined with racial, social and economic justice and it seeks to increase the political voice and visibility of low-income people of color who are transgender, intersex or gender non-conforming. A recent project focuseson improving access to respectful and affirming social, health and legal services through individual advocacywork, trainings and coalition building.The Sylvia Rivera Law Project also recently joined the NY Coalition for Immigrants' Rights to Drivers' Licenses.

Many organizations working oneconomic justice and racial justice issues that have the potentialto be models for truly inclusive organizing are small, under-funded and understaffed. LGBT organizations working within aneconomic and racial justice frame areincorporating an understanding of thevariety of bases for systemic inequality,such as race, class, gender, ethnicity,sexual orientation, gender expression,disability and/or age. They are makingconnections and common cause amonggroups marginalized and oppressed bymainstream society and analyzing race,class and gender within a context ofinstitutions, cultural norms and history.The organizations spotlighted in thisreport are doing important work thatdraws connections between multipleidentities and experiences and buildscoalitions among a broad spectrum ofmovement organizations. LGBT groups that have an integrated analysis ofracial and economic realities in the context of sexual and gender liberation areengaged in cutting-edge work that is benefiting broader sectors of society.The intersections among race, class, sexuality, and gender are multiple and theissues they encompass are vast. Foundations have an important role to play inboth understanding the complexity of these issues and supporting theorganizations that are working across these multiple connections.ConclusionThe organizations spot-lighted in this report aredoing important work that draws connectionsbetween multiple identi-ties and experiences andbuilds coalitions amonga broad spectrum ofmovement organizations.7n Both Latino/a and Asian LGBT peoples report that immigration restrictions andEnglish-language issues are major factors inhibiting economic advancement fortheir communities.n Same-sex households were 1.3% of the unmarried partners reported byAmerican Indians and Alaska Native peoples, out of a total indigenouspopulation of 2.5 million. Their overall poverty rate was calculated at 25.7%.10According to a 2001 National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute report,Leaving Our Children Behind, we can estimate that there are between 900,000 to2.5 million poor LGBT people.11In addition to facing homophobia and job discrimination during their working years,LGBT people can suffer from high rates of poverty and economic distress both earlyand late in life. n Many LGBT youth face dire economic insecurity. It is estimated that one in fouryoung LGBT people are forced out of their homes because of parental objectionto their sexual orientation, only to face hostility and harassment in adult-supervised alternative living situations. Many wind up on the streets; a 1994study reported that 75% of homeless youth worked as prostitutes.12n There are from 1 million to 2.8 million LGBT elders. Many of them live alone,without supportive family networks. Even if they are partnered, gay and lesbianelders earn less in retirement, as they are ineligible for Social Security survivorand spousal benefits, ineligible to be the beneficiary of their partner’s pensionunder most pension plans, and they must pay taxes on any 401(k) distribution(married heterosexual spouses don’t pay taxes on 401(k) benefits, and can rollthem over into a tax-exempt individual retirement account).13Further, gender-different people experience severe problems at work even in the fewstates and cities which have laws against sexual orientation discrimination.According to Shannon Minter of the Transgender Law Project of the NationalCenter for Lesbian Rights, transgender people currently have no protection underfederal or most state laws against workplace harassment or unwarranteddismissal.14 In addition, even applying for a job can be problematic, as manytransgender people also have difficulty securing personal identification documentsthat reflect their chosen gender identity rather than the sex assigned at birth. According to a 2001National Gay and LesbianTask Force Policy Institutereport, Leaving OurChildren Behind, we canestimate that there arebetween 900,000 to 2.5million poor LGBT people.Sylvia Rivera Law Project8ACCESSING PUBLIC BENEFITSThe Welfare Reform Act of 1996 has had a devastating impact on many LGBTpeople. Queers for Economic Justice, along with other LGBT groups engaged ineconomic justice work including the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF),have documented how welfare reform has impacted LGBT communities.15n There has been an increase in both homelessness and hunger in New York City’sLGBT communities since 1996 welfare reform.n Non-biological lesbian mothers are not recognized as family by the welfaresystem, and thus are not eligible for child support benefits.n Substance users who are addicted and seek public assistance are mandated intotreatment programs that are often homophobic and not sensitive to LGBTissues, resulting in gay addicts dropping out and thus being denied benefits.n Many homeless queer youth are unable to access benefits because they arerequired to provide letters from parents proving their independence, yet theseyouth are usually homeless because their parents have thrown them out and areunwilling to admit to it in writing.n Transgender people have been so severely harassed at workfare sites that mosthave quit, given up benefits and returned to sex work on the streets—wherethey feel safer.n The current and increasing promotion of faith-based programs as the providersof social services will potentially create further barriers to LGBT people inaccessing necessary services.In Leaving Our Children Behind, four elements of welfare reform that pose aparticular threat to LGBT people of all economic classes are noted.16 n Marriage promotion privileges heterosexual married couples over other familiesin social service provision and adoption proceedings.n Fatherhood initiatives, which claim that children cannot be properly raisedwithout a father, stigmatize homosexuality and lesbian and gay families.n The promotion of abstinence-only until marriage “sex education” positsheterosexual sex in the context of marriage as the only acceptable and safeform of sexual activity.n The “charitable choice” faith-based initiative provides contracts to religiousinstitutions to provide a broad array of social services, with $80 billion infederal and state funds over the next decade.“With all the recent focus on the importantstruggle for marriageequality, we sometimesforget that it is still perfectly legal for someone to be fired simply for being lesbian,gay, or bisexual in 41states. For transgenderworkers, the situation iseven more grim...” 17n Consider LGBT issues as a central theme in all economic and racial justicework.n Include sexual orientation and gender identity as a diversity category in grantguidelines.n Engage foundation staff in public education around issues affecting LGBT low-income people and LGBT people of color, especially as they relate totransgender issues.n Establish collaborations on cross-issue work that includes LGBT issues affectinglow-income and people of color populations.n Advocate with philanthropic peers to support LGBT racial and economic justicework.n Engage in active outreach to LGBT nonprofit organizations addressing theseissues and let them know you welcome their proposals for funding.INCITE! WOMEN OF COLOR AGAINST VIOLENCE, Chicago, ILwww.incite-national.orgINCITE! Women of Color Against Violence is a national activist organization of rad-ical feminists of color advancing a movement to end violence against women ofcolor and their communities through direct action, critical dialogue and grassrootsorganizing. They have issued a challenge to anti-prison activists to address theimportance of gender and sexuality in resisting the growing U.S. prison-industrialcomplex, noting that LGBTI street youth and trans people in general are particu-larly vulnerable to police brutality and criminalization. Through publications,workshops, conferences and coalitions, they are educating progressive activists onthe specific forms of state violence faced by LGBTI communities.The Ms. Foundation for Women supports INCITE’s work.Promising Practices 16ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS ARE INTERCONNECTED.Resources for low-income LGBT people and LGBT people of colorto address the range of needs they face—including employment,poverty, housing, violence and discrimination, among others—arecrucial to sustaining and expanding their work.There are multiple opportunities for the philanthropic community to support thecutting-edge work of LGBT organizations working primarily within a racial andeconomic justice framework. Low-income LGBT people and LGBT people ofcolor have been organizing around multiple issues to respond to their multipleidentities as poor people, people of color, immigrants and lesbian, gay, bisexual,and transgender people.Many foundations may be indirectly supporting LGBT people, since LGBT issuesfall within most existing program areas including housing, health, poverty,criminal justice and youth and aging. LGBT-specific organizations havehistorically faced a unique set of factors that, combined, present significantobstacles to receiving support from the philanthropic community. LGBT groupsfocusing on racial and economic justice have had an even more difficult timeaccessing philanthropic dollars.28However, as seen in the Promising Practices sections of this report, severalfoundations have actively supported LGBT organizations working on theseissues, but there remains a much greater need for assistance. There are a number of steps foundations can take to strengthen LGBTorganizations working on issues of poverty and racism:n Support the most marginalized of the LGBT community—people of color,low-income, young, elderly and transgender people.n Support organizations that demonstrate an understanding of theintersection of race, class, gender and sexuality as integral to systems ofoppression.n Support organizations and organizing efforts that are developed with andled by marginalized communities, such as LGBT people of color, poorpeople, youth, elders and disabled people.Philanthropic Supportand RecommendationsLGBT groups focusing on racial and economicjustice have had an even more difficult time accessing philanthropic dollars.9Eroding public benefits have affected LGBT people who are poor in much the sameways that all poor people have had to endure cuts in social welfare. In addition,LGBT people have had to face the added burden of discrimination because of theirsexual and/or gender identity when it comes to basic survival issues. As Jeremy Bishop, Program Director of the AFL-CIO’s Pride At Work, has written,“With all the recent focus on the important struggle for marriage equality, wesometimes forget that it is still perfectly legal for someone to be fired simply forbeing lesbian, gay, or bisexual in 41 states. For transgender workers, the situation iseven more grim. Only 4 states—California, New Mexico, Rhode Island, andMinnesota—have employment non-discrimination protections that include genderidentity/expression. There are no federal employment protections that safeguardLGBT people from discrimination on the job.” 17Queers for Economic Justice10THE MYRIAD PROBLEMS FACING LGBT PEOPLE WHOARE HOMELESS include a lack of housing and services thatmeet their specific needs. One of the most pressing needs forLGBT people living on the street is safety. When people feelunsafe, they are less likely to approach a caseworker, makingit more likely for those who identify as LGBT to be the lastin line for shelter or other services.18The experience of the LGBT homeless population points to themarginalization of LGBT people in the way in which services are offered.LGBT people have unique experiences and suffer from specificdiscrimination because of their sexual and gender identity.19 For example:n An estimated 40-50% of the homeless youth living on New York City’sstreets identify as LGBT. They are living there because they werethrown out of their homes for being queer, or ran away to escape anabusive situation.n Family housing in the shelter system across the country is not availablefor homeless same-sex couples.n Transgender people are not allowed to choose with which gender theyare more comfortable living in the shelter system.n Abuse and harassment of LGBT homeless people is rampant in theshelter system.n Most domestic violence shelters do not accept gay men or transgenderpeople.n There has been a lack of any comprehensive plan for long-term housingfor people with AIDS. n Transgender seniors are often homeless. Throughout their lives, theonly jobs that were available to many of them were low-paying and off-the-books (bars, sex work), which did not allow for savings, pensions orSocial Security.Homelessnessand LGBT PeopleFIERCE!, New York, NYwww.fiercenyc.orgFabulous Independent Educated Radicalsfor Community Empowerment (FIERCE) isa community organization formed in 2000by transgender, lesbian, gay, bisexual, two-spirit, queer and questioning (TLGTSQQ)youth of color in New York City. FIERCEorganizes for housing, employment,education and healthcare for homeless andlow-income youth, and provides training incommunity leadership. A recent projectincludes Fenced OUT, a youth-inspireddocumentary created in collaboration withFIERCE!, Paper Tiger Television and TheNeutral Zone. Fenced OUT documents thestruggle of LGBTSTQ youth of color to savethe Christopher Street pier and the WestVillage from re-development andgentrification. FIERCE! has used thedocumentary as a public education tool toraise awareness about the increasingdisplacement, violence and criminalizationexperienced by LGBTSTQ youth of color. A grant from the North Star Fund supports FIERCE’s organizing work. Promising Practices 15U.S. IMMIGRATION IS LARGELY BASED ON THEPRINCIPLE OF FAMILY UNIFICATION, which allowsU.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to sponsor theirspouses (and other family members) for immigration pur-poses. Same-sex partners of U.S. citizens and permanentresidents, however, are not considered “spouses” and arehence excluded from family-based immigration rights.25In addition, U.S. law bans all HIV-positive persons from entering orimmigrating to this country. LGBT HIV-positive immigrants are lesslikely to have family in the U.S. and many HIV-positive immigrantswho are denied residency and deported face the possibility ofpersecution in their country of origin. This can include harassment,confinement, quarantine, denial of medical services includingemergency care, denial of access to medications, ostracization and evenphysical abuse and torture. The Audre Lorde Project’s Immigrant Rights Working Group hasidentified a range of issues that LGBT immigrants face.26 These include:n Barriers to accessing services, especially if they are closeted in thecommunities where they live and in their racial and ethniccommunities.n LGBT immigrants are more likely to face violence based on raceand ethnicity and/or sexual identity and/or gender identity.n Undocumented LGBT immigrants are unlikely to find meaningfulemployment.LGBT groups are working in coalition with immigrant rights groups tocall attention to the discrimination faced by immigrant populations inthe U.S.27 This advocacy has taken on an even greater importance since9/11 with the subsequent U.S. war on terrorism, including the massroundup of immigrants, detention without charges and denial of legalcounsel to detainees.

This has led many LGBT POCgroups to develop an analysis that is actually opposed to enhanced penalties.In addition, and consistent with the above-stated data, the NationalCoalition of Anti-Violence Programs’ 2004 annual report on anti-LGBTviolence reports that a disproportionate number of LGBT victims are ofAfrican descent (20% of all victims for whom race and/or ethnicityinformation was available) and Latinos/as (17%). The next largest categoryof victims (6%) was people who identified as multiracial.24 Significantly,there was a 70% increase in the number of victims who identified as beingmultiracial. The NCAVP report further cautions that with the current political,economic and social climate which began with the “war on terrorism” andthe current call for federal and state constitutional amendments banningsame-sex marriage, the likelihood is that the level of hate crimes,particularly against LGBT and people of color, will continue to rise.The Audre Lorde Project11LGBT COMMUNITIES HAVE AN IMPORTANT STAKE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES. As more and more public resourcesare shifted away from human needs toward prisons and policing, it’snecessary to explore the impact on LGBT communities.Specific groups within the LGBT community are disproportionately affected byviolence and discrimination, sometimes at the hands of law enforcement officials. Inrecent years, there have been many documented instances of police brutalitydirected towards LGBT people in the U.S. Many police departments continue to beaccused of insensitivity, including not appropriately responding to violence directedat LGBT people.20 For example:n LGBT people of color, youth, and sex workers are particularly vulnerable topolice misconduct and abuse; transgender people are also at greater risk ofbeing targeted by police and treated inappropriately or abusively while in policecustody.n LGBT people of color, transgender people and LGBT homeless youth aredisproportionately targeted by police officers for non-violent drug arrests; theyare more likely than most white, heterosexual middle-class drug users to facedrug possession charges; and they often receive harsher sentencing. n Once imprisoned, LGBT people are frequently targeted for additionalharassment in an already inhumane prison system.LGBT People and theCriminal Justice SystemAMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE LGBT RIGHTS PROGRAM, Philadelphia, PAwww.afsc.org/lgbtThe AFSC LGBT Rights Program makes connections between increased U.S. militarism, incarceration and LGBTcommunities.

One of the most pressing needs forLGBT people living on the street is safety. When people feelunsafe, they are less likely to approach a caseworker, makingit more likely for those who identify as LGBT to be the lastin line for shelter or other services.18The experience of the LGBT homeless population points to themarginalization of LGBT people in the way in which services are offered.LGBT people have unique experiences and suffer from specificdiscrimination because of their sexual and gender identity.19 For example:n An estimated 40-50% of the homeless youth living on New York City’sstreets identify as LGBT. They are living there because they werethrown out of their homes for being queer, or ran away to escape anabusive situation.n Family housing in the shelter system across the country is not availablefor homeless same-sex couples.n Transgender people are not allowed to choose with which gender theyare more comfortable living in the shelter system.n Abuse and harassment of LGBT homeless people is rampant in theshelter system.n Most domestic violence shelters do not accept gay men or transgenderpeople.n There has been a lack of any comprehensive plan for long-term housingfor people with AIDS. n Transgender seniors are often homeless. Throughout their lives, theonly jobs that were available to many of them were low-paying and off-the-books (bars, sex work), which did not allow for savings, pensions orSocial Security.Homelessnessand LGBT PeopleFIERCE!, New York, NYwww.fiercenyc.orgFabulous Independent Educated Radicalsfor Community Empowerment (FIERCE) isa community organization formed in 2000by transgender, lesbian, gay, bisexual, two-spirit, queer and questioning (TLGTSQQ)youth of color in New York City.

Low-income LGBT people and LGBT people ofcolor have been organizing around multiple issues to respond to their multipleidentities as poor people, people of color, immigrants and lesbian, gay, bisexual,and transgender people.Many foundations may be indirectly supporting LGBT people, since LGBT issuesfall within most existing program areas including housing, health, poverty,criminal justice and youth and aging. LGBT-specific organizations havehistorically faced a unique set of factors that, combined, present significantobstacles to receiving support from the philanthropic community. LGBT groupsfocusing on racial and economic justice have had an even more difficult timeaccessing philanthropic dollars.28However, as seen in the Promising Practices sections of this report, severalfoundations have actively supported LGBT organizations working on theseissues, but there remains a much greater need for assistance. There are a number of steps foundations can take to strengthen LGBTorganizations working on issues of poverty and racism:n Support the most marginalized of the LGBT community—people of color,low-income, young, elderly and transgender people.n Support organizations that demonstrate an understanding of theintersection of race, class, gender and sexuality as integral to systems ofoppression.n Support organizations and organizing efforts that are developed with andled by marginalized communities, such as LGBT people of color, poorpeople, youth, elders and disabled people.Philanthropic Supportand RecommendationsLGBT groups focusing on racial and economicjustice have had an even more difficult time accessing philanthropic dollars.9Eroding public benefits have affected LGBT people who are poor in much the sameways that all poor people have had to endure cuts in social welfare. In addition,LGBT people have had to face the added burden of discrimination because of theirsexual and/or gender identity when it comes to basic survival issues. As Jeremy Bishop, Program Director of the AFL-CIO’s Pride At Work, has written,“With all the recent focus on the important struggle for marriage equality, wesometimes forget that it is still perfectly legal for someone to be fired simply forbeing lesbian, gay, or bisexual in 41 states. For transgender workers, the situation iseven more grim. Only 4 states—California, New Mexico, Rhode Island, andMinnesota—have employment non-discrimination protections that include genderidentity/expression. There are no federal employment protections that safeguardLGBT people from discrimination on the job.” 17Queers for Economic Justice8ACCESSING PUBLIC BENEFITSThe Welfare Reform Act of 1996 has had a devastating impact on many LGBTpeople. Queers for Economic Justice, along with other LGBT groups engaged ineconomic justice work including the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF),have documented how welfare reform has impacted LGBT communities.15n There has been an increase in both homelessness and hunger in New York City’sLGBT communities since 1996 welfare reform.n Non-biological lesbian mothers are not recognized as family by the welfaresystem, and thus are not eligible for child support benefits.n Substance users who are addicted and seek public assistance are mandated intotreatment programs that are often homophobic and not sensitive to LGBTissues, resulting in gay addicts dropping out and thus being denied benefits.n Many homeless queer youth are unable to access benefits because they arerequired to provide letters from parents proving their independence, yet theseyouth are usually homeless because their parents have thrown them out and areunwilling to admit to it in writing.n Transgender people have been so severely harassed at workfare sites that mosthave quit, given up benefits and returned to sex work on the streets—wherethey feel safer.n The current and increasing promotion of faith-based programs as the providersof social services will potentially create further barriers to LGBT people inaccessing necessary services.In Leaving Our Children Behind, four elements of welfare reform that pose aparticular threat to LGBT people of all economic classes are noted.16 n Marriage promotion privileges heterosexual married couples over other familiesin social service provision and adoption proceedings.n Fatherhood initiatives, which claim that children cannot be properly raisedwithout a father, stigmatize homosexuality and lesbian and gay families.n The promotion of abstinence-only until marriage “sex education” positsheterosexual sex in the context of marriage as the only acceptable and safeform of sexual activity.n The “charitable choice” faith-based initiative provides contracts to religiousinstitutions to provide a broad array of social services, with $80 billion infederal and state funds over the next decade.“With all the recent focus on the importantstruggle for marriageequality, we sometimesforget that it is still perfectly legal for someone to be fired simply for being lesbian,gay, or bisexual in 41states. For transgenderworkers, the situation iseven more grim...” 17n Consider LGBT issues as a central theme in all economic and racial justicework.n Include sexual orientation and gender identity as a diversity category in grantguidelines.n Engage foundation staff in public education around issues affecting LGBT low-income people and LGBT people of color, especially as they relate totransgender issues.n Establish collaborations on cross-issue work that includes LGBT issues affectinglow-income and people of color populations.n Advocate with philanthropic peers to support LGBT racial and economic justicework.n Engage in active outreach to LGBT nonprofit organizations addressing theseissues and let them know you welcome their proposals for funding.INCITE!

Many organizations working oneconomic justice and racial justice issues that have the potentialto be models for truly inclusive organizing are small, under-funded and understaffed. LGBT organizations working within aneconomic and racial justice frame areincorporating an understanding of thevariety of bases for systemic inequality,such as race, class, gender, ethnicity,sexual orientation, gender expression,disability and/or age. They are makingconnections and common cause amonggroups marginalized and oppressed bymainstream society and analyzing race,class and gender within a context ofinstitutions, cultural norms and history.The organizations spotlighted in thisreport are doing important work thatdraws connections between multipleidentities and experiences and buildscoalitions among a broad spectrum ofmovement organizations. LGBT groups that have an integrated analysis ofracial and economic realities in the context of sexual and gender liberation areengaged in cutting-edge work that is benefiting broader sectors of society.The intersections among race, class, sexuality, and gender are multiple and theissues they encompass are vast. Foundations have an important role to play inboth understanding the complexity of these issues and supporting theorganizations that are working across these multiple connections.ConclusionThe organizations spot-lighted in this report aredoing important work that draws connectionsbetween multiple identi-ties and experiences andbuilds coalitions amonga broad spectrum ofmovement organizations.7n Both Latino/a and Asian LGBT peoples report that immigration restrictions andEnglish-language issues are major factors inhibiting economic advancement fortheir communities.n Same-sex households were 1.3% of the unmarried partners reported byAmerican Indians and Alaska Native peoples, out of a total indigenouspopulation of 2.5 million. Their overall poverty rate was calculated at 25.7%.10According to a 2001 National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute report,Leaving Our Children Behind, we can estimate that there are between 900,000 to2.5 million poor LGBT people.11In addition to facing homophobia and job discrimination during their working years,LGBT people can suffer from high rates of poverty and economic distress both earlyand late in life. n Many LGBT youth face dire economic insecurity. It is estimated that one in fouryoung LGBT people are forced out of their homes because of parental objectionto their sexual orientation, only to face hostility and harassment in adult-supervised alternative living situations. Many wind up on the streets; a 1994study reported that 75% of homeless youth worked as prostitutes.12n There are from 1 million to 2.8 million LGBT elders. Many of them live alone,without supportive family networks. Even if they are partnered, gay and lesbianelders earn less in retirement, as they are ineligible for Social Security survivorand spousal benefits, ineligible to be the beneficiary of their partner’s pensionunder most pension plans, and they must pay taxes on any 401(k) distribution(married heterosexual spouses don’t pay taxes on 401(k) benefits, and can rollthem over into a tax-exempt individual retirement account).13Further, gender-different people experience severe problems at work even in the fewstates and cities which have laws against sexual orientation discrimination.According to Shannon Minter of the Transgender Law Project of the NationalCenter for Lesbian Rights, transgender people currently have no protection underfederal or most state laws against workplace harassment or unwarranteddismissal.14 In addition, even applying for a job can be problematic, as manytransgender people also have difficulty securing personal identification documentsthat reflect their chosen gender identity rather than the sex assigned at birth. According to a 2001National Gay and LesbianTask Force Policy Institutereport, Leaving OurChildren Behind, we canestimate that there arebetween 900,000 to 2.5million poor LGBT people.Sylvia Rivera Law Project6Far from being concentrated at the high-income end, a significant number of LGBTpeople are clustered at the lower end of income distribution. Gay, lesbian, bisexual,and transgender persons are not, as a group, wealthier than heterosexuals and yetthe myth prevails despite the fact that a number of LGBT groups are working todraw the connections between economic justice issues in the context of LGBTissues.6Moreover, LGBT people of color are very likely to earn less than white LGBTpeople. Recent studies utilize data from the 2000 U.S. Census to provide crucialinformation on LGBT communities of color. The studies are noteworthy, despite thelimitations of utilizing census data that only report same-sex households, becausepeople of color in general, and LGBT people of color in particular, are oftenoverlooked or ignored by researchers.   n African American female same-sex households reported a median income of$18,000 less than their white female counterparts; African American malesame-sex households reported a median income of $20,000 less than whitemale same-sex couples.7n A study analyzing census data for Latino/a same-sex households in Florida—where the largest population of Latino/a same-sex households is concentrated—showed that the male and female same-sex households in which both partnersare Latino/a earn far less than their white same-sex counterparts: $23,000 lessfor Latina same-sex households and $17,500 for Latino same-sex partners.8n Household income of less than $25,000 a year was more common among Asiansame-sex partners than among non-Asian gay and lesbian partners, reaching17% in New York and Los Angeles.9SYLVIA RIVERA LAW PROJECT, New York, NYwww.srlp.orgNamed after civil rights pioneer Sylvia Rivera, the Law Project works to increase the political presence of the transgender community.

In her 1998 report, Income Inflation: The Myth of Affluence Among Gay, Lesbian,and Bisexual Americans, economist Lee Badgett notes that LGBT people do notearn more than heterosexual people. Badgett points to the diversity of economic lifeamong LGBT populations, observing that in many cases, LGBT people earn lessthan their heterosexual counterparts.4In her findings, Badgett specifically notes two studies that suggest that gay menearn less than similarly qualified heterosexual men, which strongly suggests theinfluence of workplace discrimination. Lesbian households often make much lessthan comparable gay male or heterosexual households. Gay, lesbian and bisexual people are found throughout the spectrum of income distribution: some are poor, a few are rich and most are somewhere in the middle, along with most heterosexual people.5Overview:Poverty and Economic Reality in LGBT CommunitiesQUEERS FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE, New York, NYwww.queersforeconomicjustice.orgQueers for Economic Justice works to challenge and change the systems that createpoverty and economic injustice and to promote an economic system that embracessexual and gender diversity.

Meanwhile, inMassachusetts, the state SupremeCourt ruled the banning of gay mar-riage unconstitutional. In neighboringCanada, same-sex marriage was legal-ized. Despite these gains, which surelycontribute to reducing discrimination,there remain many major legal, social,economic and racial barriers toachieving full equality for all LGBT people.In addressing the range of issues affecting LGBT lives, several LGBT organizationsare systematically studying, analyzing, acknowledging and addressing economic andracial disparities within the LGBT community. There is, however, much research andpublic education to be done to continue to address how these inequalities affectLGBT people. Increasingly, national, regional and local grassroots LGBT and allied organizationsare operating within a racial and economic justice framework. They are makingimportant connections that address issues of economic class and racial justice asthey affect both the power structure of U.S. society and the civil rights movement.This publication will spotlight many of these organizations and their critical work toachieve social justice for all people.Neither a comprehensive history nor a complete survey of organizing efforts, theaim of this report is threefold: n to identify the range and complexity of issues faced by low-income LGBT peopleand LGBT people of color;n to identify LGBT organizations that are working primarily on racial andeconomic justice issues;n and to identify foundations that are supporting this work and makerecommendations to expand that funding base. This report highlights a number of issues facing LGBT communities, as well asexisting organizing efforts among LGBT groups that effectively address racial andeconomic justice matters. There is a pressing need for greater financial resources tosupport these important community organizing efforts.Increasingly, national,regional and local grassroots organizationsare operating within aracial and economic justice framework.211 Bayard Rustin, From Protest to Politics: The Future of the Civil Rights Movement (NewYork: Bayard Rustin Fund; orig. pub. in Commentary, February, 1965).2 Badgett, M.V.

Community organizing on these issues spanscenturies and includes many demands for change—from civil rightsto fair wages, immigrants’ rights to education reform, environmentaljustice to native sovereignty. Considerable infrastructure for progres-sive social action in relation to racial and economic justice is inplace. Along with resource organizations, communications tools andother supportive apparatus, the experience and ongoing commitmentof seasoned activists and organizations have been, and continue tobe, key assets for movement building.Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have long been involved in efforts forracial and economic justice. Today, LGBT organizers and groups are increasinglydrawing connections between the movement for LGBT rights and the movement foreconomic and racial justice, noting that people have multiple, layered identities andare members of more than one community at the same time, simultaneously experi-encing oppression and privilege. Progressive organizers have aimed to address the manner in which racism, sexism,class oppression and other systems of discrimination create inequalities that struc-ture the relative positions of LGBT people. Many of them are incorporating intotheir work the specific historical, social and political contexts that create unique andmultifaceted individual experiences. In addition to homophobia, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people confrontracism and poverty on a daily basis. Low-income and LGBT people of color are particularly marginalized and vulnerable within both the LGBT community and thebroader society. They face multiple oppressions and a range of issues including the erosion of public benefits and the dismantling of welfare; lack of affordable housingand homelessness; employment discrimination; immigration restrictions; labor issuesand workers’ rights; violence; incarceration and involvement with the criminal jus-tice system; and environmental racism. Many LGBT organizations have primarily focused—often out of necessity—onsecuring non-discrimination protections, basic inclusion in civil rights measures, andremedies for discriminatory acts. Many of these efforts have met with great success.For example, in 2003 the U.S. Supreme Court, in Lawrence v. Texas, overturnedWe can agitate the rightquestions by probing at the contradictions…~Bayard Rustin1Introduction2 Table of Contents3 Introduction5 Overview: Poverty and EconomicReality in LGBT Communities10 Homelessness and LGBT People11 LGBT People and the CriminalJustice System13 Violence and Discrimination AgainstLGBT People15 Immigrants’ Rights and the LGBTCommunity16 Philanthropic Support andRecommendations 18 Conclusion19 Examples of Organizations Workingon Racial and Economic JusticeIssues21 ReferencesACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWriting/Research: Surina Khan and Marcia M.
