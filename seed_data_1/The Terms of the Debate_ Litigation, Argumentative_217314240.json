Recently, Perry v. Schwarzenegger, a challenge to California’s ban on same-sex marriage, and Gill v. Office of Personnel Management, a lawsuit challenging section three of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, have created divisive debate. Leading scholarship and commentary on the litigation of decisions like Perry and Gill have been strongly critical, predicting that it will produce a backlash that will undermine the same-sex marriage cause.   These studies all rely on a particular historical account of past same-sex marriage decisions and their effect on political debate. According to this account, the primary effect of same-sex marriage litigation has been the mobilization of conservative opponents of the cause. Groups like the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family successfully organized efforts to elect opponents of same-sex marriage and to introduce state constitu-tional bans.   However, the historical account underlying these criticisms of same-sex marriage litiga-tion is fundamentally incomplete. Leading studies have missed important effects, such as advocacy groups using judicial decisions on same-sex marriage as opportunities to change the rhetorical strategies and coalitions that define the debate. National gay rights groups like the Freedom to Marry Coalition and the Human Rights Campaign responded to important same-sex marriage decisions by stressing equality-based claims. Socially conservative organizations like the Family Research Council increasingly emphasized religious freedom or parental rights. At the same time, seemingly because of the decisions, alliances shifted. Labor and libertarian groups played a less central role while civil rights groups began shaping the alliances on either side. These developments may well prove to be favorable to the same-sex marriage cause.  At this point it is difficult to assess whether the changes studied here will benefit the same-sex marriage movement in the long term. However, without studying all the effects of same-sex marriage litigation, current conclusions about its value are premature and poten-tially flawed. Litigation might prove to have been much more strategically advisable than some current scholarship suggests. At the very least, the litigation campaign should be judged not by an incomplete historical account but by an assessment of its full impact.  I.

INTRODUCTION Why, in the face of ongoing criticism, do advocates continue to pursue same-sex marriage litigation? Recently, high profile cases like Perry v. Schwarzenegger,1 a challenge to California’s ban on same-sex marriage, and Gill v. Office of Personnel Management,2 a lawsuit challenging section three of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, have created divisive debate.3 Leading scholarship and commentary on the litigation of past decisions like Perry and Gill have been powerfully critical, predicting that future litigation would produce a backlash that would undermine the same-sex marriage cause.4 Women’s and gender studies Professor John D’Emilio has argued that “the most significant outcome of [same-sex marriage] litigation has been the negative legislative and voter response that the [litigation of same-sex marriage cases has] elicited.”5 Gerald Rosenberg, a law professor at the University of Chicago, claims that, “given the federal Defense of Marriage Act and the legal barriers in forty-five states, [one can argue that] proponents of same-sex marriage would have been better off never having litigated in the first place.”6 Michael Klarman, a Harvard Law School professor and legal historian, asserts that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s decision in Goodridge v.  1.  704 F. Supp. 2d 921 (N.D. Cal. 2010). For an analysis of the earlier evolution of Perry, see William Eskridge, Jr. & Darren Spedale, Who Will Win the Gay Marriage Trial?

Ac-cording to this account, the primary effect of same-sex marriage litigation has been backlash—the mobilization of conservative oppo-nents of the cause.11 Groups like the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family have been arguably successful in organizing efforts to elect opponents of same-sex marriage and in introducing state constitutional bans of it.12    However, the historical account underlying criticisms of same-sex marriage litigation is fundamentally incomplete. Leading studies have missed the ways in which lawyers and gay rights activists have responded to the decisions, often changing the rhetorical strategies and coalitions that define the debate. As we shall see, partly in response to Baker v. State,13 a Vermont opinion, and Goodridge v. Department of Public Health,14 a Massachusetts decision, national gay rights groups like the Freedom to Marry Coalition and the Hu-man Rights Campaign began stressing equality-based claims. Before the Baker decision, such national gay rights organizations encour-aged members not to make equality- or civil-rights-based claims. Similarly, between the Supreme Court’s summer 2003 decision in Lawrence v. Texas15 that sodomy bans were unconstitutional and the issuance of Goodridge, privacy-based arguments have played at least as prominent a role in same-sex marriage advocacy as did the equality-based arguments that now define public discussion. Responding to Baker and Goodridge, same-sex marriage organizations and their opponents appear to have shifted the balance of the argumentative strategies that they had used. Gay rights organizations began focus-ing on claims that linked the same-sex marriage movement of the early 2000s to the civil rights movement of the 1960s.16 In turn, opponents of same-sex marriage, such as Focus on the Family, the  7.  798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003).  8.

The evolution of the debate in Massachusetts offers a persuasive example. Whereas before the decisions, in the late 1990s, state gay rights organizations were able to form alliances only with labor organizations or libertarian groups, Goodridge forced minority and civil rights organizations to take a stand for the first time. After Goodridge, groups like the Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus (MGLPC) were able to win their first endorsements from civil rights leaders like Coretta Scott King and Julian Bond of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).18 By understanding the way that cause lawyers and grassroots ac-tivists used decisions like Baker and Goodridge to reshape the terms of the debate and the coalitions participating in it, we will see that the impact of same-sex marriage litigation may be both more pro-found and more complex than some scholars suggest. At this point it is difficult to tell whether the changes studied here will benefit the same-sex marriage movement in the long term. However, without studying all the effects of same-sex marriage litigation, current con-clusions about its value are premature and potentially seriously flawed. Litigation may prove to have been much more strategically advisable than some current scholarship suggests. At the very least, the litigation campaign should be judged not by an incomplete historical account but by an assessment of its full impact. Bakerand Goodridge did not simply increase opposition to same-sex mar-riage. Both decisions also fundamentally changed the terms of and the players in the debate in a way that may advance the same-sex marriage cause.  My argument proceeds in three parts. First, by tracing demands for same-sex marriage made between 1970 and 1990, Part II de-scribes the mounting criticism of litigation of cases like Perry andGill. Part III considers the role of the litigation of Baehr v. Lewin,19the Hawaii Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage decision, in making same-sex marriage a nationally prominent issue and, in doing so, po-tentially benefiting the same-sex marriage movement.

Part IV studies how Baker and Goodridge helped to alter the argumentative strategies used by groups on either side of the issue. Looking closely at a case study involving the same-sex marriage debate in Massachusetts, Part V analyzes the way in which the changing terms of the marriage debate helped to reshape the coalitions involved in the struggle. Part VI briefly concludes.  II. PERRY, GILL, AND THE LITIGATION QUESTION In the face of continuing skepticism, proponents of same-sex mar-riage have continued to pursue litigation. Nonetheless, critics have pointed to several waves of backlash that have followed judicial deci-sions favoring same-sex marriage. In 2004, following the recognition of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, a series of successful state constitutional bans was introduced.20 Some observers attribute the victories by Republican opponents of same-sex marriage in the 2004 elections to the backlash against the Goodridge opinion.21 From 2008 to 2009, anger about the California Supreme Court’s decision in In re Marriage Cases22 created intense opposition, culminating in the pas-sage of Proposition Eight, a state constitutional amendment over-turning the decision.23 In the academy, these events inspired a number of attacks on the use of litigation by the same-sex marriage movement. Gerald Rosen-berg has written extensively on the courts’ inability to create political change, be it in the context of same-sex marriage or otherwise.24 Re-cently, in writing about the same-sex marriage struggle, Rosenberg suggested that the use of litigation has been entirely counterproductive for the movement.25 As he succinctly writes, “Litigation as a means of obtaining the right to same-sex marriage has not succeeded.”26 20.

Rosenberg, The Irrelevant Court: The Supreme Court’s Inability to Influence Popular Beliefs about Equality (or Anything Else), in REDEFINING EQUALITY 172 (Neal Devins & Davison M. Douglas eds., 1998) (arguing that the Court’s decisions do not affect popular opinion about racial or gender equality).  25.  See generally ROSENBERG, supra note 6, at 339-421.  26.  Id. at 415. 472 FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 39:467  Michael Klarman, who has written extensively on the backlash produced by controversial judicial decisions, has also suggested that victories achieved through litigation have set back the same-sex mar-riage movement.27 He has focused on the popular defiance produced by the Goodridge decision, arguing that the litigation of the case increased opposition to same-sex marriage.28 He emphasized the ways in which Goodridge created backlash: by increasing public at-tention to the same-sex marriage issue and by attempting to settle the issue before public support for same-sex marriage had solidified.29Historians of sexuality and sexual orientation, like John D’Emilio, have been equally critical.30 Skepticism about the value of litigation for same-sex marriage has intensified recently because of the prominence of two related cases. Perhaps the best known case, Perry v. Schwarzenegger,31 involved a federal constitutional challenge to Proposition Eight.32 Perry attracted attention for several reasons. First, those challenging Proposition Eight, Theodore Olson and David Boies, often had found themselves on opposing sides of the political spectrum in the past and, in fact, argued against one another in Bush v. Gore.33 Second, at the trial court level, Perry dramatically held that Proposition Eight violated both the federal Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause.34 Third, as a federal challenge, Perry also may well reach the Supreme Court.35 Concerns about backlash have featured prominently in discussion regarding Perry. As William Eskridge and Darren Spedale have shown, attorneys defending Proposition Eight have argued in court that the popular backlash likely to follow a same-sex marriage victo-ry in Perry would “undermine the legitimacy of the federal courts.”36Commentators generally sympathetic to the same-sex marriage cause  27.

See Eskridge & Spedale, supra note 1.  2012]  THE TERMS OF THE DEBATE 473 have been equally vocal in questioning the wisdom of those pursuing the Perry litigation. In a joint memo signed by nine organizations, including Lambda Legal, the Human Rights Campaign, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), advocates sympathetic to the cause predicted that popular backlash might lead to defeat in the Supreme Court.37 As the joint memo explained, “There is a very sig-nificant chance that if we go to the Supreme Court and lose, the Court will say that discrimination against LGBT people is fairly easy to justify.”38 At the same time, Jennifer Pizer, the Lambda attorney who argued Perry at the state level, stressed the unique dangers of backlash tied to federal litigation.39 Similar concerns about backlash have surrounded the decision to litigate Gill.40 Brought by Mary Bonauto and GLAD, Gill and its companion case, Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Department of Health and Human Services,41 present several challenges to Section three of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which denied a host of federal benefits to married same-sex couples.42 In July 2010, Judge Joseph Tauro of the Massachusetts District Court ruled in GLAD’s favor, holding that Section three violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and, in Department of Health and Human Services, that it also violated the Tenth Amendment provisions on state authority.43 Even some supportive of the same-sex marriage cause have suggested that Gill will do the movement more harm than good. For example, Jack Balkin has argued that if the Supreme Court upholds the ruling in Gill on appeal or even denies certiorari—in effect, permitting the same result—the Court would “spark an equally big political backlash.”44 Many of the criticisms of the litigation strategy like the ones pur-sued in Perry and Gill rely on a particular historical narrative about the impact of past same-sex marriage decisions. According to this narrative, litigation primarily has undermined the same-sex mar-riage cause.45 Victories in cases like Baehr v. Lewin, Baker, and  37.  See Arana, supra note 3.  38.  Id. 39.

See, e.g., ROSENBERG, supra note 6, at 415-16. 474 FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 39:467 Goodridge increased opposition to same-sex marriage.46 Socially con-servative groups like the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family mobilized to oppose the decisions.47 Partly because of these activists, a wave of measures opposing same-sex marriage appeared, including state constitutional bans.48 Relying on this history, critics in the same-sex marriage movement and the academy caution against the use of litigation both in cases like Perry and Gill and in the future.  However, the historical account on which these critics rely is in-complete. As we shall see, decisions like Baker and Goodridge not only produced backlash but also influenced the terms of the debate about same-sex marriage and the coalitions participating in it in a way that may have advanced the same-sex marriage cause. It is diffi-cult to establish whether these shifts will necessarily benefit the same-sex marriage movement in the long term; however, the history considered here will show that the past effects of same-sex marriage litigation have been more complex and less well understood than many current studies suggest. Criticisms of the decision to litigate cases like Perry and Gill are at best premature. Past decisions like Baker and Goodridge should be judged by their true impact, not by an incomplete and unduly negative historical narrative. With a bet-ter understanding of the past, we may see that the litigation of cases like Baker and Goodridge—and current cases like Perry and Gill—were more beneficial for the same-sex marriage movement than we may now realize.  III.   THE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE QUESTION: 1970-1993  As George Chauncey has convincingly shown, the first legal de-mands for same-sex marriage long predated the litigation of Baehr v. Lewin in the early 1990s.49 For example, in the 1970s, same-sex cou-ples in Minnesota and Los Angeles brought constitutional test cases that received national press attention.50 Nonetheless, as we shall see, same-sex marriage was mostly a marginal issue for the mainstream gay rights movement before the 1993 Baehr decision. In this regard, Baehr may have benefitted the same-sex marriage cause by dramati-cally increasing awareness of the issue, both in the gay rights move-ment and in the broader society.  46.

TIMES, Mar. 16, 1977, at D6.  2012]  THE TERMS OF THE DEBATE 475 A.   Before Baehr: 1970-1993  When same-sex marriage first emerged as an issue, it was not tied to major gay liberation organizations but instead to the Metropolitan Community Church, founded in 1969 in Los Angeles by the Reverend Troy Perry.51 The church’s stated mission involved the provision of spiritual sanctuary and guidance to openly gay men and women who had been turned away from mainstream churches.52 Originally, when Reverend Perry celebrated twenty-eight commitment ceremo-nies in 1970, church leaders described the ceremonies in religious, rather than political, terms.53 In February of 1970, Reverend Perry explained that gay couples had spiritual reasons for seeking mar-riage and “settling down like anyone else.”54 The term often used to describe the relationship celebrated by the Church, “holy unions,” also made apparent the religious dimension of the Church’s ceremo-nies.55 By the summer of 1970, however, some couples, including those involved with the Church, began seeking legal recognition of their relationships.56 Between 1970 and 1971, a number of prominent test cases drew on the church’s efforts to legalize same-sex unions but did so in ex-clusively secular and legal terms. The most famous test case, Baker v. Nelson,57 brought by University of Minnesota students Richard Baker and James McConnell, had no link to the church’s religious rhetoric. Baker and McConnell focused instead on rights to privacy, freedom of association, and freedom from cruel and unusual punish-ment involved in barring access to marriage.58 Like Baker and McConnell’s ultimately unsuccessful litigation, many of the early test cases were brought without contact with the church and without major organizational support. For example, when a Boulder, Colorado, county clerk performed six gay weddings in 1975, the New York Times reported no link to the church or to any other major group.59 It was only in the spring of 1977 that test cases  51.

In March of that year, for example, Reverend Mikhail Itkin—the prior of the Commu-nity of the Love of Christ, a similar organization—brought a test case on behalf of himself and his partner that invoked, among other things, the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause.60 For the most part, however, even test cases like Itkin’s disap-peared from the gay rights legal reform agenda between 1978 and 1990. There were several reasons for this development. First and most obviously, the test cases brought between 1970 and 1977 had been uniformly unsuccessful and offered little encouragement to ac-tivists interested in legalizing gay marriage. The relative success of Baker v. Nelson,61 the case that advanced the furthest in the courts, is illustrative of the generally dismal results that activists encoun-tered: the Minnesota Supreme Court did not reject Baker and McConnell’s privacy and sex discrimination claims out of hand, but rather analyzed their arguments before ultimately rejecting them.62 As importantly, inspired by the Stonewall Riot of 1969, major rad-ical gay rights organizations like the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activists’ Alliance viewed marriage reform as unimportant, if not dangerously conformist. For example, the Gay Liberation Front protested not only in favor of homosexual rights but also against the institution of marriage.63 As Michael Brown, a member of the Gay Liberation Front, explained to the New York Times in August 1970, “We’re not oriented toward acceptance but toward changing every institution in the country—male domination, capitalist exploitation, all the rest of it.”64 Moreover, between 1975 and 1979, as part of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) campaign, women’s organizations that might have been sympathetic to demands for same-sex marriage began to distance themselves from the issue. By July 1975, discussion of same-sex marriage had become a central tactic of Phyllis Schlafly’s S.T.O.P. E.R.A. and other major organizations opposed to the Amendment. As Schlafly wrote in a July 1975 edition of The Phyllis Schlafly Report, the “ERA [would] legalize homosexual marriages and give homosexuals and lesbians all the rights of husbands and wives such as the right to file joint income tax returns, to adopt chil-dren, to teach in the schools, etc.”65 Between 1974 and 1976, the ho- 60.

Sandra Turner, the executive director of the New York Equal Rights Coali-tion, said of opposition arguments, “None of the scare tactic things they say will happen—such as legalizing homosexual marriages.”67By 1977, after President Carter announced and funded a national conference in honor of International Women’s Year (IWY), feminist members of the Oversight Committee for IWY supported “lesbian rights” in the abstract but clearly stated that the ERA would not “require [s]tates to permit homosexual marriages.”68 During the period between 1977 and 1990, gay rights activists also saw little reason to make same-sex marriage a great priority. One reason for the movement’s inattention to the issue was the out-break of the AIDS epidemic, which made marriage seem of marginal importance. By 1987, organizations like the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) and the Human Rights Campaign reported to the New York Times that AIDS had “increased the level of gay partic-ipation in American politics by a tremendous amount.”69 However, as the New York Times reported, “energy and resources of gay groups [were] diverted from basic rights issues,” such as those for marriage, sodomy ban repeals, or the introduction of antidiscrim-ination ordinances, as more time was devoted “toward efforts for more funds for AIDS treatment and research and to protect infected people from discrimination.”70 At the same time, between 1985 and 1987, in states like New York and California, the publicity surrounding the AIDS crisis prompted an anti-gay backlash, even against reforms considered to be more mainstream than same-sex marriage, includ-ing the repeal of sodomy bans, as opponents of gay rights cited public  66.

The Supreme Court’s 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick73 also helped to make marriage a less central priority in the gay rights legal reform agenda. Bowers rejected a constitutional challenge to a Geor-gia law criminalizing homosexual sodomy.74 The decision reoriented the reform agenda of major gay rights organizations in several ways. First, the decision focused new attention on the need to repeal crimi-nal sodomy bans. The NGLTF founded the Privacy Project, an initia-tive focused on campaigning against Bowers and the sodomy bans that remained on the books in twenty-five states and the District of Columbia.75 In speaking out against Bowers, members of groups like the NGLTF also emphasized the link between sodomy bans and the denial of other rights to which gays or lesbians should be entitled.76 In the aftermath of Bowers, groups like the NGLTF and Lambda Legal pursued a two-pronged strategy: challenging sodomy bans while also pursuing municipal or statewide laws prohibiting discrim-ination in employment, housing, or public accommodations. Organizers like Nan Hunter of the ACLU embraced this approach, and Sue Hyde of the NGLTF explained, “[I]t [was] not wise to have sodomy law repeal as the first goal [for a statewide group]. . . . [L]ocal or statewide civil rights protection laws and hate crimes legislation [were] easier to fight for.”77 Hyde’s prediction proved to be correct: whereas only Wisconsin and the District of Columbia prohibited sex-ual orientation discrimination when Bowers was decided, several other states had done so by 1993, including Massachusetts, Connecti-cut, New Jersey, Vermont, and Rhode Island.78 In the struggle for  71.

B.   Baehr: The Birth of a National Issue  As a whole, national gay rights organizations continued to deem-phasize same-sex marriage as a legal reform goal between 1990 and 1994. For example, when Ninia Baehr and Genora Dancel, Joseph Melillo and Patrick Lagon, and Tammy Rodrigues and Antoinette Pregil challenged the decision to deny them marriage licenses in the early stages of the Baehr litigation, the ACLU and the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund turned away the couples’ requests for assistance.79 ACLU attorneys later cited “serious strategic questions,” including a fear of backlash, as justification for the organization’s refusal to take the case.80 Baehr helped to increase the prominence of the same-sex marriage issue within national gay rights organizations and in state and national debates. However, backlash accompanying the rising prom-inence of the same-sex marriage issue is well known. In 1996, partly because of fear that the Full Faith and Credit Clause would require other states to recognize same-sex marriages celebrated in Hawaii, Congress passed a federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), and sev-eral states passed similar measures.81 Nonetheless, Baehr also helped to make same-sex marriage an organizational priority for both gay rights groups and their opponents.  Indeed, in July 1995, a coalition of prominent national gay rights groups, calling themselves the Freedom to Marry Coalition, were willing to endorse the cause publicly and met in order to discuss how best to frame the issue.82 Similarly, Human Rights Campaign leaders first spoke out about same-sex marriage in the spring of 1996, after the Defense of Mar-riage Act was introduced in response to Baehr. However, while working to prevent then-President Clinton from supporting DOMA, the Human Rights Campaign did not argue that same-sex marriage was  79.  Paul M.

Before the Baehrdecision and to take advantage of the election of a conservative, “fam-ily values” majority in Congress, evangelical organizations like Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, and the Traditional Values Coalition focused not on same-sex marriage but on the pas-sage of a “Religious Equality Amendment” to the Federal Constitution, a measure that would legalize school prayer and overrule Supreme Court decisions to the contrary.87 After Baehr, New Right groups committed significant resources and time to the passage of a Federal Defense of Marriage Act. By November 1999, Reverend James Dob-son of Focus on the Family described same-sex marriage as the greatest threat to family values.88 Baehr succeeded in drawing public attention and organizational interest to the issue of same-sex marriage and, in doing so, poten-tially benefitted the same-sex marriage movement. However, as we shall see, the effects of two later same-sex marriage decisions, Baker and Goodridge, were more complex. These decisions helped to reshape the argumentative strategies of major organizations on either side of the debate.   83.  See, e.g., Joseph Hanania, The Debate Over Gay Marriages: No Unity, L.A.

THE TERMS OF THE DISCUSSION The major argumentative strategies used by national organiza-tions on either side of the same-sex marriage battle looked very dif-ferent in 2004 than they did in 1999.89 Citing recent decisions by the Vermont Supreme Court and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, proponents downplayed privacy-based claims or arguments featuring the traditional importance of marriage, instead empha-sizing arguments about the rights of gay and lesbian couples to equal treatment. For their part, after the decision of Goodridge in 2003, same-sex marriage opponents like the Family Research Coun-cil began deemphasizing arguments that homosexuality should never be socially acceptable and would necessarily undermine straight marriage. Instead, these organizations echoed Goodridge’s empha-sis on civil rights and equal treatment as support for their own claims of religious liberty. Opposition to same-sex marriage was reframed as an exercise of the very civil rights of which the Goodridge Court spoke.   At least at this point in the same-sex marriage struggle, it is im-possible to assess which side will benefit in the long term from the changes in argumentative strategies studied here. At the same time, however, scholars portraying the history of same-sex marriage litiga-tion in purely negative terms have done so prematurely and poten-tially incorrectly. These decisions proved to be powerful tools for same-sex marriage advocates working to reshape the terms of discus-sion and the alliances that shaped it. By missing the effects of these judicial decisions on the terms of the same-sex marriage debate, scholars have looked at only part of the story. With a fuller under-standing of the past, we may see that the litigation of cases like Baker and Goodridge, or even Perry and Gill, was more beneficial than some leading analyses suggest.  89.  It is worth noting that, in the early stages of the struggle for same-sex marriage, grassroots and regional organizations led the campaigns in Hawaii and Vermont. Significantly, in the lead-up to Baker, Beth Robinson and Susan Murray of the Vermont Freedom to Marry Coalition, a grassroots lobbying and litigation unit, and Mary Bonauto of GLAD, a regional litigation group, championed equality-based arguments that had been rejected by national gay rights groups. At a press conference in November 1998, Bonauto explained that Baker was “about what . . . Vermont’s guarantees of equality mean for Vermont citizens.” See Mary Ziegler, Framing Change: Cause Lawyering, Constitutional Decisions, and Social Change, 94 MARQ. L. REV. 263, 300 (2010) (quoting Gay Marriage Debate Set in Vermont Court, SACRAMENTO BEE, Nov. 18, 1998, at A5). At a Vermont Freedom to Marry rally the following February, Deborah Lashman, a prominent member of Vermont Freedom to Marry, reaffirmed this rhetorical strategy, explaining that the issue was whether the Vermont Constitution allowed “the Legislature to single out a class of families for adverse treatment.” Press Release, Vermont Freedom to Marry Task Force, Civil Rights Group Denounces Discriminatory Bill (Feb. 1999) (on file with the author). 482 FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 39:467 A.   The Freedom to Marry Coalition  In the mid-1990s, the Freedom to Marry Coalition members, which are now known as Marriage Equality U.S.A. and Freedom to Marry, grew out of informal meetings on marriage strategy called by Lambda Legal and joined by several other gay rights organizations.90By July 1995, the organizations formally called themselves the Free-dom to Marry Coalition and set out to develop a coherent rhetorical strategy.91 Coalition members first considered whether to use equal protection arguments like those advanced in the campaign against “anti-special-treatment” laws, measures prohibiting antidiscrimina-tion protections for gays and lesbians.92 After California Governor Pete Wilson vetoed an anti-sexual-orientation discrimination bill in 1991,93 a number of states began introducing “anti-special-treatment” legislation, including Colorado’s Amendment 2, which would ulti-mately be challenged in 1996 in Romer v. Evans.94 The Coalition’s polling data indicated that a majority of Ameri-cans believed that same-sex marriage was “not a civil rights issue.”95Instead of connecting the same-sex marriage movement to the movement for civil rights, Coalition members were asked to describe marriage as a “[b]asic human right,” something that same-sex cou-ples “already ha[d]” that was “being taken away.”96 In 1996, the Human Rights Campaign issued “talking points” for debaters that reflected this emphasis.97 In focusing on similar concerns, the Coalition created a Marriage Resolution, stating that “[b]ecause marriage is a basic  90.

This was apparent when Coalition leaders called another meeting in October 1995 to discuss with which organizations or individual leaders the Coalition could form alliances.99 Coalition leaders named a number of possible con-stituencies to whom rights-based arguments might appeal, including “unions, women’s groups, people of color groups, religious groups,” progressive civil rights groups, celebrities, and corporations “with non-discrimination policies.”100 After Republican Senators first presented the federal Defense of Marriage Act in May 1996,101 the Coalition continued relying primari-ly on rights-based arguments in campaigning for same-sex marriage. For example, Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), one of the organizations belonging to the Coalition, sent out an alert about the Defense of Marriage Act, arguing that “[m]arriage [was] a basic human right” and that “[t]he decision of whom to marry [was] a deeply personal one that should not be inter-fered with [by] the federal government.”102 Between 1997 and the winter of 1999, the Coalition continued re-lying primarily on rights-based arguments in campaigning for same-sex marriage. These efforts still centered on the Marriage Resolution, as did the Coalition’s strategy of building alliances with religious or-ganizations or civil rights groups willing to sign it.103 When the Coali-tion did make equality-based legal arguments, those claims did not directly involve sexual orientation. On National Freedom to Marry Day in 1998, for example, Evan Wolfson, one of the Coalition leaders, did not stress equality-based claims but reiterated that “[t]he choice  98.

After rejecting a claim that Vermont’s existing marriage statute provided for gay marriage, the Baker majority surveyed Vermont precedent on the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution, an analysis not directly tied to the suspect-class juris-prudence decided under the federal Equal Protection Clause.109 Rely-ing on the text and history of the Common Benefits Clause, and without specifying a remedy, the majority held that same-sex couples were “entitled under Chapter I, Article 7, of the Vermont Constitu-tion to obtain the same benefits and protections afforded by Vermont law to married opposite-sex couples.”110 Of course, Baker touched on rights- as well as equality-based ar-guments. The decision discussed the cultural significance of marriage and stressed its “public benefits and protections.”111 But the decision emphasized equal protection doctrine and equality-based rhetoric.   In doing so, Baker became an important new tool for the Coalition, legitimating and highlighting equality-based arguments explicitly linked to the decision itself.

During the 2001 celebration of National Freedom to Marry Day, Ruth Harlow of Lambda borrowed the language of the Baker major-ity in arguing that the celebration signified “a desire for all couples to be treated equally by law—nothing more, and nothing less.”118 In the same year, Evan Wolfson of the Coalition similarly explained that, in Baker, the gay rights movement had “show[n] that there [was] no good reason for sex discrimination in civil marriage, just as there was no good reason for race discrimination in civil marriage a generation ago.”119 During the lead-up to oral argument in Lawrence v.

For example, Wolfson, speak-ing on behalf of what was then called the Freedom to Marry Collabo-rative, argued that equal protection arguments would be the most effective.124 By contrast, when Ruth Harlow of Lambda spoke to the press, she stressed that the petitioners in Lawrence were asking only for the government “to not have the police prosecute you for choosing one particular way to express your love for someone else in pri-vate.”125 In trying to persuade the Court of their position, Coalition members, like the counsel for the petitioners, had reason to adopt a number of alternative arguments that might persuade the Court.126 When Lawrence was decided, various commentators stressed that the analytical approach used in the case was hard to identify.127 The Court relied, among other things, on historical evidence and prece- 121.

See Brief of the Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae in Support of Petitioners, at 27-30, Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003) (No. 02-102).

Conkle, Three Theories of Substantive Due Process, 85 N.C. L. REV. 63, 66 (2006) (arguing that Lawrence“compounded the problems of doctrinal clarity and judicial consistency” already plaguing substantive due process doctrine); Nelson Lund & John O. McGinnis, Lawrence v. Texas and Judicial Hubris, 102 MICH. L. REV. 1555, 1612 (2004) (arguing that substantive due process doctrine has “now culminated in the utter analytical confusion that is Lawrence,which offers no guidance at all for the future”). 2012]  THE TERMS OF THE DEBATE 487 dents decided abroad of “an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.”128 Explaining that the “[s]tate [could] not demean [the petititoners’] existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime,” Law-rence implied that the petitioners’ “right to liberty” gave “them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the gov-ernment” but never set out a standard of review, explaining only that the statute challenged in Lawrence “further[ed] no legitimate state interest which [could] justify its intrusion into the personal and pri-vate life of the individual.”129 Of course, it is possible to read Lawrence as recognizing that equality- and rights-based arguments are inextricably linked. How-ever, in recognizing the close relationship between equality and liberty interests, the Lawrence Court could have framed subsequent debate in several ways. First, this framing could have been accomplished by using a clear, traditional doctrinal approach, such as the equal pro-tection analysis suggested by Justice O’Connor in her concurring opinion in Lawrence.130 Alternatively, as would be the case in Goodridge, the Court could have used or avoided equality rhetoric in describing the relationship between the constitutional interests. Un-surprisingly, because Lawrence used conflicting and sometimes novel rhetoric in striking down the Texas sodomy ban, members of the Coa-lition drew on it to expand their repertoire of claims.   For example, some Lambda members described Lawrence as both a privacy and an equal rights decision, arguing that “[n]on-gay Amer-icans are coming to understand that excluding gay people from family protections such as access to healthcare . . . is wrong, just as including the police in our bedrooms is wrong.”131 In the summer immediately after Lawrence was decided, PFLAG members made similarly wide-ranging arguments in explaining their support for same-sex mar-riage.132 For example, one suggested that same-sex marriage was an issue of equal protection and equal dignity; another argued that mar-riage was a choice-based right like abortion; and yet another argued that marriage was an issue of privacy.133 Because Lawrence was open-ended and because its doctrinal underpinnings were relatively  128.

See id.488 FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 39:467 obscure, the decision did not have the same effect on the arguments made by the Coalition that Baker had several years before.  The amicus brief joined by Freedom to Marry in Goodridge like-wise characterized marriage as a constitutionally protected “intimate association,”134 based on the “right of privacy”135 and “the right of free expression.”136 Instead of highlighting the interests of same-sex couples in equal treatment, the amicus brief identified the right to same-sex marriage as part of the line of cases explaining constitu-tional rights to freedom of speech or “liberty and privacy.”137 In closing, the brief stated that marriage was a “unique expressive re-source”138 protected by state and federal “constitutional guarantees of free speech.”139 After it was announced on November 18, 2003, the Goodridge de-cision provided an important opportunity for activists to reshape the arguments and coalitions stressed by the Coalition. Writing for a four-justice majority, Chief Justice Margaret Marshall explained that Goodridge was both an equal protection and due process decision.140Indeed, Marshall acknowledged that, for the purposes of same-sex marriage, “the two constitutional concepts . . . overlap[ped].”141 How-ever, the Goodridge majority consistently stressed civil- and equal-rights rhetoric in describing the relationship between different constitutional protections.142 The court began by explaining “that civil marriage [had] long been termed a ‘civil right’ ” entitled to constitu-tional protection.143 The court also stressed an analogy between Goodridge and anti-miscegenation-statute cases like Loving v. Vir-ginia,144 explaining that in both cases “a statute deprive[d] individu-als of access to [the] institution of . . . marriage—because of a single trait: skin color in . . . Loving, sexual orientation here.”145 After considering the three state interests offered to justify the exclusion of same-sex couples—the creation of an environment favor-able to procreation, the guarantee of an optimal environment for child rearing, and the budgeting of limited financial resources—the  134.

The organization first considered the effect of Goodridge onits strategy in November 2003 at a staff meeting on civil marriage.149Some of the arguments emphasized at the meeting were drawn from Goodridge itself, including statements that “[m]arriage [was] not static [and had] evolved over time” and that marriage was “not solely for procreation even as currently constructed.”150 However, more arguments drew on the civil rights and equality-based rhetoric used by the Goodridge Court.151 One staff member suggested stressing an analogy between the victories of the marriage equality movement and “[o]ther civil rights advances such as Brown v. Board of Education.”152 When Coalition members spoke to the press on behalf of Freedom to Marry, they not only borrowed the rhetoric of Goodridge but also described the decision as primarily an equality-based one. When speaking to the Washington Post, for example, Wolfson compared the same-sex marriage struggle to the effort to “end . . . race discrimina-tion in marriage, and women’s subordination in marriage.”153 Freedom to Marry members continued making equal-rights argu-ments drawn from Goodridge as members of the Massachusetts State Legislature proposed alternatives to same-sex marriage, including a state constitutional ban and some form of civil union statute.154 In February 2004, when the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court clarified that only marriage would satisfy the requirements set forth in the Goodridge decision, Coalition members again called Goodridgea case that was decided “in favor of marriage equality” and was intended  146.

As a part of this effort, Coalition members described same-sex marriage as a civil rights issue that should be supported by racial and ethnic minorities. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a key member of the Coalition, published a report suggesting that “black gay and lesbian couples actually have more to gain on average from the ability to marry.”156 Sean Cahill, the director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute, argued that constitu-tional amendments banning same-sex marriage “represent[ed] an issue of racial and economic justice.”157 Dr. Kenneth Samuel of the Victory Church of Stone Mountain, Georgia, an African-American pastor invited to speak by the Task Force, told the press that “homo-phobia and racism, along with sexism, [were] really three heads to the same monster.”158 In this way, over time, Freedom to Marry came to define its legal reform agenda as one of marriage equality.159 By 2004, in a set of talking points issued to Freedom to Marry members, leaders de-scribed the organization as one focused on the “shared goal of secur-ing full equality and protections under the law,” an organization in-volved in a “civil rights struggle.”160B.   The Human Rights Campaign  In 1982, the Human Rights Campaign was formed as a federally registered political action committee designed to provide financial support to political candidates supportive of gay rights.161 From the time of its founding, the Human Rights Campaign portrayed itself as bipartisan, moderate, and politically influential.162 In its early years,  155.

The Campaign also urged Freedom to Marry and other organizations to “fram[e] th[e] issue [of same-sex marriage] in terms of basic human rights and individual personal choices,” because “[m]ost voters [did] not believe [that] marriage [was] a civil right.”169 The Campaign sup-ported the efforts of the Freedom to Marry Coalition and made strategy recommendations to members of the same-sex marriage movement.170In particular, the Campaign advised activists not to make equality-based or civil rights arguments but to assert instead that “[a]dults  163.

Instead, Human Rights Campaign organizers worked to shift the nation’s attention to more popular gay rights issues, such as “hospital visitation” or “guardianship” rights.172 Primarily, the Campaign avoided an endorsement of same-sex marriage, focusing instead on employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Human Rights Campaign led efforts to pass a federal Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and lobbied heavily for employment discrimination protections for gay civil service employees.173 Indeed, when the organization first circulated a pamphlet about same-sex marriage in the summer of 1999, the Human Rights Cam-paign adopted a strategy similar to the one used in the ENDA cam-paign—activists would avoid constitutional arguments and would instead draw attention to any positive change in popular opinion. In a pamphlet about the views of religious leaders on same-sex mar-riage, for example, the Human Rights Campaign characterized intense debate within religious communities as “a sign of [the] pro-gress” of popular opinion on the issue.174 Leaders of the Campaign initially did not make use of Baker oreven focus on the issue of same-sex marriage. In supporting the pres-idential candidacy of Al Gore, for example, Elizabeth Birch spoke not about same-sex marriage but about hate crimes and employment dis-crimination.175 In Vermont, as Democratic legislators were ousted in the 2000 elections for supporting civil union legislation, the Human Rights Campaign even considered supporting a Republican candidate who had not endorsed the civil union law.176 However, in May of 2003, when the organization took a public stand in support of same-sex marriage and condemned the introduc-tion of an anti-same-sex-marriage constitutional amendment, the group drew heavily on the rhetoric and reasoning of Baker. Birch borrowed the equality-based arguments that had emerged in Baker, 171.  See Human Rights Campaign, supra note 97. 172.

POST,Sept. 17, 2000, at A6. 2012]  THE TERMS OF THE DEBATE 493 stating that the Constitution was “designed to protect the basic equality and civil rights of all Americans.”177 In explaining the organ-ization’s position on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage laws, Birch argued that “[t]he bottom line on the issue of marriage [was] that gay and lesbian couples deserve the same rights and protections that most other American families take for granted.”178 Baker helped to legitimate and make salient this particular kind of claim.  Because Lawrence was rhetorically and doctrinally ambiguous, members of the Campaign made a variety of equality- and rights- based arguments in the immediate aftermath of the decision. For example, Winnie Stachelberg, the organization’s political director, criticized supporters of the anti-same-sex-marriage amendment for not having “read the opinion in the Lawrence case,” which was “first and foremost about affirming every American’s right to privacy.”179To support the constitutional amendment, Stachelberg argued, would be to “erase the right to privacy.”180 The wide range of arguments made after Lawrence was also re-flected in the organization’s July 2003 “Rapid Response Campaign,” a program designed to capitalize on a potential victory in Goodridge.181The $1,000,000 campaign was intended to “frame the debate and shape public opinion about civil marriage for gay and lesbian cou-ples” through polling, public education, and lobbying.182 In addition to emphasizing equal protection arguments,183 members of the Human Rights Campaign were instructed to argue that “[m]arriage ought to be a matter of individual personal decision,” a privacy interest like the one described in Lawrence.184 As the Lawrence Court was thought to have done, Human Rights Campaign members were also told to state that “[t]he decision of whom to marry should be left to individu-als—not dictated by the government.”185Goodridge again allowed Campaign members to shift the balance of arguments used by its members, this time increasing the promi-nence of equal protection and civil rights contentions.

But once the battle was joined by the other side, with the big-ots refusing any compromise, the Montgomery movement had no choice but to escalate their demands. . . . On same-sex marriage, the LGBT community has reached a similar juncture.189 In the years immediately following Goodridge, the Human Rights Campaign continued drawing on the decision’s equality-based rheto-ric in its own advocacy. In marking the anniversary of Goodridge in2004, for example, the Campaign praised the decision for recognizing the importance of “equality under the law.”190 The organization also began sponsoring events in order to show that the same-sex marriage movement was a civil rights movement. In June of 2004, the organi-zation held a press conference attended by prominent African Ameri-can clergymen and civil rights leaders who also opposed the federal  186.

In the fall of 2003, the organization had primarily described marriage as an is-sue of intimate association, personal choice, and constitutional priva-cy. By 2005, and partly because of Goodridge, the right to marry had become a right to “marriage equality.”194C.   The Changing Opposition  Between 1995 and 2006, major organizations opposed to the legal-ization of same-sex marriage also changed their rhetorical strategies and did so partly in response to the success their opponents had in drawing on the rhetoric of the Baker and Goodridge decisions. Before the issuance of these opinions, major New Right organizations often described the same-sex marriage debate as a referendum on the legit-imacy or social acceptance of homosexuality or emphasized claims that same-sex marriage would undermine the nuclear family and heterosexual marriage. Goodridge, and the use of it by the same-sex marriage movement, forced these groups to rework some of their ar-gumentative strategies in a way that may well have benefited the same-sex marriage cause. The opinion helped to increase the promi-nence of equality-based and civil rights claims made by proponents of same-sex marriage. In part because of Goodridge, anti-same-sex-marriage activists responded by focusing less on the social harms produced by gay couples and more on the freedom of belief and the parental rights of citizens potentially opposed to same-sex marriage.   191.

The Traditional Values Coalition  Founded in 1980 by the Reverend Louis Sheldon, the Traditional Values Coalition, or TVC, is a lobbying group representing 43,000 churches.195 Before founding the TVC, Sheldon already had focused a significant part of his political career on opposing gay rights. His en-try into politics came with the ultimately unsuccessful 1977 Califor-nia initiative, sponsored by state legislator John Briggs, that would have allowed school boards to dismiss or deny employment to “open and notorious homosexuals.”196 In 1978 Sheldon also played a key role in campaigning for a failed initiative requiring the dismissal of all openly gay public school teachers.197 With the formation of the TVC in 1980, Sheldon embraced a vision of legal reform that drew on Christian religious teachings and an originalist interpretation of the Constitution. As the TVC explained in its mission statement:  Traditional Values are based upon biblical foundations and upon the principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, the writings of the Founding Fathers, and upon the writings of great political and religious thinkers throughout the ages. . . . . In short, Bible-based traditional values are what created and what have preserved our nation. We will lose our freedoms if we reject these values.198 Sheldon’s reform vision was at its most influential between 1990 and 1994 when the TVC campaigned against state- and municipal-level laws banning sexual orientation discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations. After 1991, when the TVC suc-cessfully led lobbying efforts to convince California Governor Pete Wilson to veto an anti-sexual-orientation-discrimination employment law, the TVC expanded its campaign, sponsoring “anti-special-rights” legislation and constitutional amendments in Colorado, Arizona, Or-egon, Washington, and Missouri.199 The Baehr decision did make opposition to same-sex marriage an organizational priority for the TVC, however, Sheldon framed the issue not as one about the propriety of same-sex marriage but instead  195.

He criticized Baehr by explaining that “[w]hat [gays] really want[ed] [was] ac-ceptance, and that [was] something we [could not] give to them.”200Moreover, in working closely with the wave of “family values” Repub-licans elected to Congress in 1994, Sheldon focused as much on cam-paigning for “anti-special-rights” legislation as he did on opposing same-sex marriage.201 Between 1995 and 2003, as the TVC partnered with other New Right organizations in campaigning for state and federal defense-of-marriage legislation, Sheldon continued to emphasize the broader harm that a “homosexual lifestyle” would do to American culture and gender relations rather than the effect that same-sex marriage would have on straight unions. In 1996, for example, while campaigning for a defense-of-marriage measure in California, Sheldon told the Balti-more Daily Record that “[l]egalizing homosexual marriage would place our youth at risk, in addition to having a disastrous effect on individual citizens, businesses, churches and practically every seg-ment of our society.”202 In 1997, Sheldon expanded on this critique, proposing that legalizing same-sex marriage would result in the “degendering” of America.203 It was the Goodridge opinion that helped to reshape the TVC’s rhetorical strategies. Before Goodridge, members of the TVC focused not on marriage itself but on the damage that social acceptance of homosexuality would do to American culture. Partly because of Goodridge and the success that same-sex marriage groups had in drawing on it, the TVC deemphasized these claims, stressing instead that a majority in the United States opposed same-sex marriage: as one representative explained in 2003, “[w]e have found that the more people focus on [same-sex marriage], the less they support it.”204 In the winter of 2004, the TVC elaborated on this strategy, bringing African-American ministers to condemn marriage equality and to join in a “state-by-state grassroots effort to pass legislation protecting marriage.”205 200.

Focus on the Family  Founded in 1977 by child psychologist and minister Reverend James Dobson, Focus on the Family is a nonprofit corporation and Christian media outlet that currently reaches 5,000 radio and televi-sion stations in 155 countries.210 Led exclusively by Dobson from the time of its founding until 2003, Focus exercises policy influence pri-marily through its radio broadcasts, television programs, and film series.211 However, Dobson and his successors, Don Hodel (named to the position in 2003) and Jim Daly (named to the position in 2005), have routinely been active in electoral and legislative campaigns, as well as in public interest litigation.212 Between 1985 and 1999, Dobson and Focus highlighted legitimacy-based and defense-of-marriage claims. In a summer 1998 fundraising letter, for example, Dobson presented the same-sex marriage struggle as a referendum on the social acceptability of homosexuality, arguing that the “highly coordinated . . . effort[s]” to establish same-sex mar-riage were not the true focus of gay activists.213 Instead, as he wrote,  206.

As Dob-son wrote in a fundraising letter: “If homosexuals are permitted to marry, then the entire legal basis for the family [will be] undermined. . . . Marriage would mean anything—or, more likely, nothing at all.”216Goodridge marked a significant shift in the organization’s argu-mentative strategies. By March 2004, Focus had become a prominent member of the Arlington Group, a coalition of conservative organiza-tions and leaders opposed to same-sex marriage.217 The following May, when serving as the keynote speaker at Mayday for Marriage, an important opposition event, Dobson demonstrated a different rhe-torical strategy, one highlighting not only the threat posed by gays to heterosexual marriage but also the harmful effects that same-sex marriage would have on public schools’ curricular programming.218First, Dobson openly denounced homophobia, suggesting that Focus members were “not here to harm or disrespect” the gay activists present at a counter-rally.219 Dobson further emphasized that proponents of same-sex marriage, not its opponents, promoted discrimination.220 He stressed that same-sex marriage would deny parents the right to raise their children as they saw fit, for “[p]ublic schools [would] be used as propaganda machines for the gay agenda.”221 Dobson built on this strategy after 2004 when he founded Focus on the Family Action, a 501(c)(4) organization more involved in elec-toral politics than Focus on the Family, a 501(c)(3) corporation—a nonprofit corporation.222 Parental-rights arguments were featured prominently in 2006 in political advertisements run by Focus Action  214.

Instead, the Focus Action advertisements drew on the equality rhetoric from Goodridge as supporting a right to oppose same-sex marriage.226 If same-sex marriage were legalized in California, the advertisements reasoned, “[m]inisters [would] be jailed if they preach[ed] against homosexuality” and “[p]arents [would] have no right to prevent their children from being taught in school about same-sex marriage.”227 Instead of concentrating on the potential flaws with the equality-based language in Goodridge, Focus borrowed from it. As recently as 2011, Dobson has continued to insist that “if same sex marriage is legalized and the rest of the gay agenda is achieved, the church will be subjected to ever-increasing oppres-sion and discrimination.”228F.

In 1992, for example, Bauer suggested that the group’s chief concern was with the lax Bush Administration policy on “unwholesome TV programming and other threats to children.”231In the early 1990s, the Council also addressed the issue of religious harassment and discrimination, campaigning for changes in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Guidelines on reli-gious harassment and discrimination and promoting the ultimately unsuccessful Religious Equality Amendment.232 After Baehr brought new attention to the same-sex marriage issue in 1993, the Council, as had Focus on the Family, portrayed the issue of same-sex marriage as one involving the acceptability of homosexu-ality as a lifestyle. In responding to the Baehr decision, Robert Knight of the Council told the New York Times that the decision should be condemned because it was “part of the pan-sexual move-ment’s attempt to deconstruct . . . morality in the culture.”233 Council leaders like Knight and Bauer continued to stress legitimacy-based arguments during hearings about the federal Defense of Marriage Act. When testifying before Congress in favor of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, Bauer explained that accepting same-sex marriage would require Congress to “restructure our entire sexual morality and social system to embrace a concept that has never been accepted anywhere in the world by any major culture.”234 229.

Bauer, President, Family Re-search Council). 502 FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 39:467  It was only in responding to the Baker decision that the Council began emphasizing defense-of-marriage rather than legitimacy-based claims. For example, in February 2000, Bauer identified Baker as “an unmitigated disaster for the American family.”235 The following March, the Council’s chief spokesperson Janet Parshall employed a similar rhetorical strategy, explaining that opposition to same-sex marriage was necessary for the “defense of marriage.”236 As Parshall explained, “Giving same-sex relationships or out-of-wedlock hetero-sexual couples the same special status and benefits as the marital bond would not be the expansion of a right but the destruction of a principle.”237 Before the winter of 2003, the Council emphasized similar claims in opposing a proposed domestic-partnership law in California and a Vermont civil union measure introduced in response to Baker. As then-Council President Kevin Connor explained in the organization’s newsletter, same-sex unions posed the most “serious threat to marriage since the states foolishly chose no-fault divorce in the 1960s.”238Goodridge prompted Council leaders to reconsider such argumen-tative strategies. In February 2004, the Council sponsored adver-tisements not directly justifying unequal treatment of gay couples but rather focusing on public schools’ curricular programming.239 In particular, the advertisements claimed that “[c]ertainly teachers would have to teach that marriage has more than one option.”240 In September 2004, the Council sponsored a simulcast, titled the “Battle for Marriage,” emphasizing claims that same-sex marriage would “threaten religious freedom and force schools to teach homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle.”241 In the fall of 2006, at the Values for Voters Summit, Tony Perkins, a leader of the Council, did not focus on criticizing Goodridge but instead emphasized the equality interests of opponents of same-sex marriage.242 Invoking Goodridge, Perkins contended that “the ad-vancement of same-sex marriage” threatened “religious liberties.”243In a promotional film circulated throughout the evangelical commu- 235.

In July 2008, the Council sponsored a panel discussion centering on these claims and addressing “Religious Liberty and . . . Counterfeit Marriage.”245 The panel focused on “the threat posed to First Amendment rights and religious liberty protections” and asked whether “churches [would] be able to deny marri[age to] homosexual couples” and whether “Chris-tian organizations [would be able to] retain their religious identity and beliefs” if same-sex marriage were legalized.246 The Council’s advertisements that ran during the “Yes on Prop 8” Campaign also drew on the parental-rights claims forged in response to Goodridge,as promotional materials insisted that Proposition Eight has “every-thing to do with schools.”247 The Council’s new argumentative emphasis had been crafted in response to Goodridge. Because Goodridge had drawn considerable attention to the issue of equal treatment, the Council downplayed claims that homosexuals could never and should never be treated with dignity or respect. Instead, Council members accepted the Goodridge Court’s concern about discrimination in the same-sex mar-riage debate. However, as the 2008 panel discussion illustrated, Council activists presented religious opponents of same-sex marriage, not gays or lesbians, as the ones likely to be subject to discrimination.  V. RHETORICAL STAKES: SHIFTING COALITIONS IN MASSACHUSETTS Baker and Goodridge helped to shift the argumentative strategies adopted by organizations on either side of the same-sex marriage de-bate, empowering same-sex marriage advocates who wanted to make different and previously disfavored claims. It is worth considering the impact that these decisions had on the alliances, as well as on the arguments, in the struggle. Leading studies acknowledge that major decisions like Baker and Goodridge have impacted the same-sex mar-riage debate, but current scholarship suggests that the effects of these decisions have been clearly and almost primarily negative for the same-sex marriage movement.

It is difficult to say whether the same-sex marriage movement will benefit from its new set of alliances in the long term. However, before assessing whether Goodridge or Baker advanced the same-sex mar-riage cause, current studies must recognize that the players and terms of that debate have fundamentally changed. Similarly, it is possible that the litigation of Perry or Gill may reshape the coalitions in the debate in a way that would be advantageous for the same-sex marriage movement.   These changes become apparent when one studies the same-sex marriage debate in Massachusetts between 1999 and 2006. Two of the major players in the debate in this period were MGLPC and GLAD. Founded in 1973, MGLPC is a state-level, professional lobby-ing organization focused on gay rights issues.248 Before 1995 MGLPC had focused on HIV confidentiality legislation and antidiscrimination laws targeting employment and public accommodations.249 As we shall see, MGLPC began, in the mid-1990s, to commit more resources to securing legal recognition for same-sex couples. MGLPC was part-nered in this effort by GLAD, a regional, litigation-oriented organiza-tion founded in 1978.250A.   Alliance-Building, Unions, and Libertarians  Before 1999 neither organization campaigned directly or made constitutional arguments in favor of constitutional marriage. GLAD and MGLPC focused instead on providing some same-sex couples benefits that ordinarily came through marriage, but the organiza-tions did not demand legal recognition for same-sex relationships themselves. Chief among these efforts was Senate Bill 1332, a bill that would make health insurance available to same-sex partners of active or retired public employees.251 In essence, the bill created a domestic partnership status, complete with procedures for establish-ing and terminating such partnerships.  However, Massachusetts organizations did not argue that same-sex relationships themselves were deserving of legal recognition or  248.  See PATRICIA A.

In Massachusetts, for example, the Board of the Mas-sachusetts American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) endorsed the domestic partnership bill in 1998.254 Before Goodridge the groups also stressed that same-sex marriage was an issue of constitutional privacy. Groups like GLAD and MGLPC first made such constitutional arguments in favor of same-sex marriage in 1998 in response to a defense of marriage bill filed in the Massachusetts legislature.255 At the same time the Massachusetts DOMA bill was filed, libertarian organizations also proposed one abolishing restrictions on same-sex marriage and plural marriages and another eliminating any laws that punished “bedroom crimes.”256Gay rights organizations expressed interest in supporting the bill so long as it stated that “the right of two adults to marry is a funda-mental one.”257 Over time state gay rights organizations themselves began de-scribing same-sex marriage as an issue of constitutional privacy. MGPLC and the Religious Coalition for the Freedom to Marry sent out brochures “affirm[ing] the liberty of adults of the same gender to love and marry” and “insist[ing] that no one, especially the state, [should] coerce people into marriage, or bar two consenting adults of the same gender from” marrying.258 252.

In 2000 the Massachusetts Freedom to Marry Coalition count-ed several unions as existing “coalition partners,” including the National Association of Social Workers and the Libertarian Party.259Organizations that campaigned for the rights of racial or ethnic mi-norities, such as the NAACP, were only “prospect[ive]” allies.260B.   Alliance-Building and Civil Rights  In 2003, however, Goodridge affected the shape of this coalition by reframing same-sex marriage as an issue of constitutional equality. Because it made the question of civil rights more central in the ar-gumentative strategies of both opponents and proponents of same-sex marriage, Goodridge provided a valuable tool for gay rights activists seeking to establish alliances with civil rights organizations. MGLPC began stressing that Goodridge had been a historic civil rights victo-ry, and Arline Isaacson, a member of the group, compared opponents of Goodridge to racists refusing to desegregate public schools after Brown v. Board of Education.261 The organization also asked the Massachusetts Democratic State Committee to endorse a resolution, stating that support for Goodridge required recognition that “[a]ll people should be treated equally and fairly under the law.”262 GLAD similarly described civil unions or any legal status short of marriage as “separate and unequal.”263 Increasingly, and partly because of Goodridge, the debate about same-sex marriage became a discussion about the meaning of consti-tutional equality and the legacy of the civil rights movement. In the weeks following the decision of Goodridge, prominent African Ameri-cans discussed whether same-sex marriage could properly be considered an issue of constitutional equality. Carol Moseley Braun and Al Sharpton equated the same-sex marriage movement with the civil rights movement.264 Other civil rights leaders, like Julian Bond of the  259.

In December of 2004, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s daughter Bernice Albertine King led 10,000 marchers calling for the civil rights movement to speak with “a uni-fied voice” against same-sex marriage and in favor of “basic, funda-mental moral beliefs.”269 At the same time, Coretta Scott King and other members of the civil rights movement publicly supported the same-sex marriage movement and its claims of constitutional equali-ty.270 In the winter of 2005, Mark Leno, another prominent civil rights leader and pastor, proposed a same-sex marriage bill in the California Legislature.271 When asked why he supported the measure, Leno explained that the bill should be endorsed by anyone “call[ing] for equal rights.”272 Further debate about the meaning of constitutional equality and the legacy of the civil rights movement played out in the courts. In 2006 in Lewis v. Harris,273 a New Jersey same-sex marriage case, the National Black Justice Coalition, an organization composed of 3,000 gay, lesbian, and transgender African Americans, submitted a brief comparing antimiscegenation laws to current marriage laws.274 By  265.

Ferguson”—arguments that “denie[d] the relevance of human nature and biology.”278 Similarly, a brief submitted by the evangelical Cali-fornia Ethnic Religious Organization for Marriage (CEROM) rejected the antimiscegenation analogy because marriage was not “a tool to promote invidious discrimination” but a way to reinforce the com-mitment of a husband and wife “to one another and to the children they may create.”279                                                                                                                  http://www.lambdalegal.org/sites/default/files/legal-docs/downloads/lewis_nj_20051021_ amicus-national-black-justice-coalition.pdf. Lewis held that same-sex couples were entitled to identical and equal legal treatment, but the decision did not require the New Jersey Legislature to designate same-sex relationships formally as “marriages.” Lewis, 908 A.2d at 224.  275.  In In re Marriage Cases, the California Supreme Court held that the availability of domestic partnerships and the denial of marriage to same-sex couples violated the State Equal Protection Clause.

See Brief of CEROM, supra note 275, at 11-12. 2012]  THE TERMS OF THE DEBATE 509  On the other side, amici for the California NAACP and a variety of minority rights organizations read antimiscegenation cases as pro-hibiting the creation of separate institutions for disadvantaged groups. The California NAACP asserted that Goodridge had made the same “argument in favor of legalizing marriage by interracial couples . . . with words like ‘same-sex’ replac[ing] words like ‘interra-cial.’ ”280 A variety of Hispanic and Asian organizations also endorsed the antimiscegenation analogy.281 In applying state equal protection analysis, one of these briefs pointed to the shared experiences of gays and minorities in facing the “stigma of inferiority,” “second-class citi-zenship,” and “past discrimination.”282 By making civil rights a central issue in the discussion of same-sex marriage, Goodridge prompted civil rights leaders to take sides for the first time. By helping to present same-sex marriage primarily as an issue of constitutional equality, Goodridge also created coalition-building opportunities for MGLPC and GLAD that had not been available before the decision.  VI.   CONCLUSION Over the past year debate about the value of same-sex marriage litigation has intensified. Two successful suits, Perry and the consoli-dated cases in Gill, have held unconstitutional important anti-same-sex marriage laws. But even if the final outcome of these cases in the federal courts is favorable to the same-sex marriage movement, many critics suggest that the decision to litigate Perry and Gill was foolish. These commentators contend that the harm done by backlash will outweigh any potential benefits.   Many of these commentators rely on a particular historical narra-tive of the impact of past litigation. According to this account, the lit-igation of cases like Baker and Goodridge served primarily to produce backlash. Because of resistance to the decision, opponents of same-sex marriage performed well at the polls and new state constitutional bans on same-sex marriage appeared.  However, the history on which these critics rely is incomplete. Baker and Goodridge not only produced backlash but also allowed some within the same-sex marriage movement to reshape the argu-ments and coalitions that defined the same-sex marriage debate. Be-fore the decisions, equality-based claims played a marginal role in the advocacy of major gay rights organizations like the Freedom to Marry Coalition and the Human Rights Campaign. When, before the  280.  See Brief of the California NAACP, supra note 275, at 11.  281.  See, e.g., Brief of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, supra note 275.  282.  See id. at 14. 510 FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 39:467 decisions, gay rights groups emphasized privacy- or equal-pay-based arguments, libertarian and labor organizations joined the call for le-gal recognition of same-sex relationships. The opposition to same-sex marriage also used different rhetorical tactics before Goodridge.Organizations like the TVC, Focus on the Family, and the Family Research Council emphasized claims about the illegitimacy of homo-sexuality or the necessity of defending marriage.  Baker and, to a greater extent, Goodridge appear to have played an important role in changing the arguments and coalitions on either side of the debate. Both decisions highlighted equality-based reason-ing and rhetoric. Gradually, as gay rights leaders adopted these claims, same-sex marriage was repackaged as an issue of civil rights. In the same period, in responding to Goodridge, opponents of same-sex marriage stopped openly justifying the unequal treatment of gays. Instead, opposition organizations began claiming that the equality- and anti-discrimination concerns outlined in Goodridgeweighed in their favor.   The history of these decisions shows that same-sex marriage liti-gation likely has had a more complex and profound impact than cur-rent scholarship suggests. It is too early to determine whether the effects studied here will advance the same-sex marriage cause in the long term, but before scholars evaluate whether same-sex marriage litigation has harmed or helped the gay rights movement, they should account for all, not for some, of the effects of decisions like Baker and Goodridge. By refocusing discussion about gay marriage, these decisions allowed activists to alter the contentions and allianc-es that shaped the struggle. In the future, in cases like Perry and Gill, the decision to pursue litigation may seem to be much wiser than many currently think. ",

    "abstract": "Why, in the face of ongoing criticism, do advocates of same-sex marriage continue to pursue litigation? Recently, Perry v. Schwarzenegger, a challenge to California’s ban on same-sex marriage, and Gill v. Office of Personnel Management, a lawsuit challenging section three of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, have created divisive debate. Leading scholarship and commentary on the litigation of decisions like Perry and Gill have been strongly critical, predicting that it will produce a backlash that will undermine the same-sex marriage cause.\nThese studies all rely on a particular historical account of past same-sex marriage decisions and their effect on political debate. According to this account, the primary effect of same-sex marriage litigation has been the mobilization of conservative opponents of the cause. Groups like the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family successfully organized efforts to elect opponents of same-sex marriage and to introduce state constitutional bans.\nHowever, the historical account underlying these criticisms of same-sex marriage litigation is fundamentally incomplete. Leading studies have missed important effects, such as advocacy groups using judicial decisions on same-sex marriage as opportunities to change the rhetorical strategies and coalitions that define the debate. National gay rights groups like the Freedom to Marry Coalition and the Human Rights Campaign responded to important same-sex marriage decisions by stressing equality-based claims. Socially conservative organizations like the Family Research Council increasingly emphasized religious freedom or parental rights. At the same time, seemingly because of the decisions, alliances shifted. Labor and libertarian groups played a less central role while civil rights groups began shaping the alliances on either side. These developments may well prove to be favorable to the same-sex marriage cause.\nAt this point it is difficult to assess whether the changes studied here will benefit the same-sex marriage movement in the long term. However, without studying all the effects of same-sex marriage litigation, current conclusions about its value are premature and potentially flawed. Litigation might prove to have been much more strategically advisable than some current scholarship suggests. At the very least, the litigation campaign should be judged not by an incomplete historical account but by an assessment of its full impact",
