Serving lgbtq* users of the academic library  Our students are more likely than previous generations to identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, questioning, queer, intersex, transgender…. Or generally, not straight.    They are more likely to be non-conforming with regard to their gender and their sexuality.     Among U.S. adults aged 18 and over,  97.7% identified as straight, 1.6% as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% as bisexual.   But the percentage identifying as straight  is greatest for the oldest age group.

Retrieved from http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr077.pdf    “Most lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ)* youth are happy and thrive during their adolescent years.”  BUT “Negative attitudes toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people put these youth at increased risk for experiences with violence, compared with other students.  Violence can include behaviors such as bullying, teasing, harassment, physical assault, and suicide-related behaviors.”  “All students, regardless of sexual orientation, reported the lowest levels of depression, suicidal feelings, alcohol and marijuana use, and unexcused absences from school when they were   In a positive school climate and   Not experiencing homophobic teasing.” LGBT youth.

Privacy is still important “I wouldn't have asked about LGBTQ, well, unless they look friendly.  You can usually read people.

Waldman Recommendations    Have clearly written non-discrimination policies and show zero-tolerance for harassment. Why do you need to know someone’s gender?  (Why does a database need to know?)  Gender history is private. Use gender inclusive language. Consider having workshops run by people from outside your library. Educate circulation staff in helping people who’s appearance may not match their id photo or name. Collection development: Have a designated selector.  Collect biographies with positive portrayals. Point to/work with local organizations that maintain current information sources, nb related to to health.  Maintain a subject guide!

Provide referrals to local support groups and counseling agencies. 3. Use physical space for queer workshops, lectures, sex education, health information classes… 4. Raise awareness of hate crimes; work with local organizations to promote tolerance. 5. Build resources & hold exhibits on queer history & culture on local, regional, national levels. 6. Develop ICT applications, e.g. host listservs, webpages, etc. 7. Provide avenues for empowerment and community building. 8.

Wexelbaum (2015).  Problems with e-books  LGBTIQ titles are underrepresented in academic ebook collections. But “slowly improving”.

LGBTIQ Reading Habit Survey:    “Quality of LGBT ebooks is not good” and “I can’t find any”.    Content is more important than format.

Retrieved from http://repository.stcloudstate.edu/lrs_facpubs    Disappearing content:  Link rot and abandoned web projects  • Libraries can print out preservation copies of text materials – John Jay does this as part of a electronic resources cataloging project for materials within our mission area.    • Glbtq Encyclopedia Project, the “worlds largest encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, transgender and queer culture” launched in 2003, free to readers on the web, and closed in 2015 “because of the collapse of the advertising business model that had supported it”.    Disappearing content:  Commercialization of archives  • We need to find ways of funding and running archival digitization projects so that lgbtq* materials do not end up behind paywalls.   • If we find a way to pay once, materials can be free to access forever.   Open access is an lgbtq* issue  LGBTq* readers are already on the web – this is where they are looking for information.  Librarians have the opportunity and ability to counteract misinformation by making the work of our institutions’ own scholars more discoverable and accessible .  Libraries have a responsibility to expand collection development beyond our closed gardens, and add to the reliable, authoritative information freely accessible on the web.  We must  advocate for our researchers to adopt open-access publishing practices,  inform our authors of their self-archiving rights, and  encourage our researchers to post their work on the institutional archive.

(2011).  Sexual orientation microaggressions: Processes and coping mechanisms for lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals.  Journal of LGBT issues in counseling, 5:21-46.    Wheeler’s solutions for librarians • Learn about microaggressions. • Do not make assumptions about anyone’s race, sexual orientation or gender identity. Try to use gender neutral language. “May I help you, sir?” may offend!  • Review institutional policies to ensure no disconnect; inconsistencies send mixed messages.  • Make sure staff understand policies, and how they are implemented. (e.g. inform all offices how to process name changes). Wheeler, R. (2016). About microaggressions.  Law library journal 108(2):321-329.    Are lgbtq* issues relevant to the IL Framework? • Authority Is Constructed and Contextual • Information Creation as a Process • Information Has Value • Research as Inquiry • Scholarship as Conversation • Searching as Strategic Exploration   Mehra & Braquet’s Recommendations for user instruction and information literacy Mehra, B. & Braquet, D. (2011).  Progressive LGBTQ reference: Coming out in the 21st century.  Reference Services Review 39(3):401-422.   Using lgbtq* content and ideas for class • Adopt a Wikipedia article   -   Wikiproject LGBT studies.  • Explore artifacts from a lgbt digitized archive; commercial or free on the web.  • Use lgbtq* topics as search examples during BI sessions.   • Use popular culture as a starting point for exploring glbtq* themes.         Conclusion • Lgbtq* content acquisition must still happen at the item level ; bundles are good, but not sufficient. • Lgbtq* research guides can help with discoverability; preferably not “hidden” under gender studies.  • Include lgbtq* topics in BI sessions, classes.    • Lgbtq* users appreciate signs/signifiers affirming they are welcome. • Have written policies affirming non-discrimination. • Designate a selector for lgbtq* collection development and outreach.    • Encourage researchers to embrace open access publishing: especially self-archiving their work in their institutional repository.   • Digitize, digitize, digitize!

    "abstract": "Through archival research at NYPL, Herstory Lesbian Archive, and LGBT Community Center National Archive, two of these three panelists uncover narratives of how queer communities gained and/or provided increased information access through the activist work of organizations that heeded their communities\\u27 needs in the 1970s, and 80s. From the American Library Association\\u27s Gay Task Force to the work of ACT UP, these panelists illustrate how one minority group shaped the discourses about themselves when previously they had been so controlled and misrepresented by others. The third panelist, a librarian, discusses how contemporary library services support lgbtq researchers. All three presentations open a discussion about the sponsorships of literacy (see Brandt) that foster the queer counter-discourses (see Warner) as well as lay the groundwork for burgeoning counter-literacies. These panelists propose that by studying the archival past that we should be able to imagine futures that disrupt the inequities and injustices of our present (See Muñoz).\nWorks Cited\n Brandt, Deborah.
