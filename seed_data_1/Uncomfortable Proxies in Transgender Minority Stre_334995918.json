Uncomfortable Proxies in Transgender Minority Stress Research: an Anthropological Synthesis of Transphobia Abstract Over reliance on existing LGB models of minority stress is uncomfortable proxy for the conceptualization of a model particular to transgender individuals. Furthermore, proposed transgender minority stress models thus far have lacked an accompanying concept of transphobia itself. I advance five processes of transgender minority stress, along with five corresponding processes of state-sanctioned transphobia based on existing literature, an original quantitative analysis, and an original sociohistorical review of the birth of state-level transphobia. Minority stress is comprised of (a) discriminatory events and conditions (b) vigilance, (c) internalized stigma, (d) concealment and (e) delegitimization. Transphobia operates on state-level processes of (a) a sublimated eugenics program, (b) the breeding and domestication of a docile, homogenous population, (c) capitalist labor force management, (d) the policing of normative sex and reproduction, and (e) maintenance of the medical power of disenfranchisement. These state-level processes reflect the insidiously eugenic, malignantly capitalist, misogynist, and homophobic priorities of the body politic. These priorities are deployed on a social level via systematic exclusion from employment, housing, civic participation, healthcare access, and social welfare.

I say ‘toward’ because the project design has dramatically pivoted four distinct times since then—two of them quite recent. Perhaps owing to the unanticipated fluidity of my thesis structure, I met a great number of people and developed some unexpected skills along the way.  Over the past two years, I’ve connected with members of the gender studies department, the school of social work, the urban studies department, the medical school, the nursing school, the sociology department, and, of course, members of my home anthropology department. I have learned far more statistics than I ever thought necessary, and I have astounded myself by learning to code —my first foray into computer science. I suffered through some socially agonizing practice interviews with an alum willing to playact a belligerent interviewee. I bargained with IRB. Even though I did not have the chance to put my new coding and refined interview chops into practice, I’m grateful to this strange, often frustrating process for leading me to so many experiences I would not have sought out otherwise. Most importantly, I had the opportunity to synthesize those anthropological concepts that have defined my training. Additionally, I found myself synthesizing my own conceptual work in previous anthropology and non-major courses alike.  The constant working and reworking of this paper has taken place in some pretty silly settings. The most absurd of which was during my hospitalization in the spring of 2020, I wasted a not-insubstantial amount of the resident assigned to my case’s time strategizing about the changes I’d have to make to this project. I’ll flatter myself by saying morning rounds were mutually enriching. Though I look back on this memory and enjoy its delightful absurdity, I also cannot ignore my embodiment of the very stress theory I advance below in that moment. I was, after all, that hapless transgender patient I describe as the inevitable receptacle of transphobia. I was that domesticated, docile body lying motionless, sedated, with words my only recourse. Words that, given the circumstances, were unlikely to be heeded. I like to think that this reflects the reflective, nonlinear process we’re always talking about in ethnographic inquiry. What follows is a labor of love. It is also a labor of spite. Within, I am critical of the eagerness of minority stress researchers to overemphasize the individual agency of the minority individual in the face of structural discrimination. However, I recognize the effort I’ve put into this paper as an agential retaliation in itself. I also recognize my significant personal stake in this research. This paper follows the tendrils of structural transphobia. These tendrils are present in my own life, sometimes lightly pulling, sometimes dragging. My resistance, too, pulls and drags. From a place of hope and anger, I hope to lightly pull, you my reader, along with me and to drag our oppressors behind us.  Warmly, Paul Michael    Abstract Over reliance on existing LGB models of minority stress is uncomfortable proxy for the conceptualization of a model particular to transgender individuals.

Keywords: transphobia, minority stress, capitalism, eugenics, domestication, the mindful body   PART I: exploratory quantitative analysis of transgender minority stress Introduction Theories of minority stress are essentially interdisciplinary. Transgender and LGB models of minority stress are inferred from psychological concepts of objectification theory and interpersonal identity construction (Meyer 2003) (Testa 2016) (Staples 2018). Foundational sociological theories include: stress theory, social stress theory, body image, de-identification, and social anomie. In the broadest sense, minority stress theory is an extension of social stress theory, in that it distinguishes the excess social stress experienced by minorities from the stress of the general population. It thus aims to identify two things: which factors exacerbate stressors already existing in the general population and which factors are introduced vis a vis minority status. The factors are typically introduced to the body of the minority individual via the racism, sexism, colorism, ableism, ageism, homophobia, and transphobia of the social body. The most overt expression of these processes contribute to the first conceptual aim of minority stress theory—identifying novel, minority specific stressors, while the deeply entrenched, structural presence of these processes contributes to the second conceptual goal of minority stress theory—the stressors that compound existing stressful social conditions such as food insecurity, poverty, war, civil unrest, economic recession, and so on. These amplifications and introductions minority specific stress are not harmful only in time limited settings of their deployment but threaten the health, life, lifetime earnings, and security of minority individuals. Often, these moments of discriminatory stress are difficult to track, prove, or even detect. Meaning, even minority individuals themselves might not be aware when structures of inequity are acting on them. That is, a person need not be aware that they have been discriminated against to be effected. For example, it would be hard to know—much less prove—that one has been denied housing on the basis of minority status. Another example: it would be near impossible to prove discriminatory intent in being continuously passed over for promotion in favor of non-minority candidates. Nonetheless, these instances of discrimination significantly determine a person’s career earnings, housing security, healthcare access, and employment.   Thus, minority stress is a “diagnosis of exclusion”.  Discriminatory events that cannot be proven outright must be inferred via between and within-group comparisons of social and health outcomes that are likely impacted by pervasive social exclusion. A quantitative analysis of transgender minority stress is a workable site for such inferences. While the connections between discriminatory events and poor outcomes are theoretically and conceptually obvious, it is often the case that social—particularly legislative—progress demands proof in its own terms. Thus, practitioners of those disciplines that constitute minority stress theories must work to surface the black box by which minority individuals are violated. That is, researchers are compelled to out the man behind the curtain in order to gain the social leverage to effect meaningful change to better the lives of those individuals these theories attempt to describe. The data There are seven public health surveys currently in circulation in the United States that include both a sex and a gender variable. Of the seven, only two use robust sampling strategies and complex survey weights to representatively sample the demography of the U.S. population: the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS). The remaining five are convenience samples of pediatric patients, insurance group members and university students (Patterson 2017). Of these, the BRFSS, by virtue of its breadth of content, is best suited to make sense of the epidemiology of Minority Stress in transgender Americans. The BRFSS is a complex stratified sample of the U.S. adult, non-institutionalized population. Participants are selected based on census data, and surveys are conducted by telephone. As of 2015, cellphone surveys were introduced in addition to landline surveys to best sample the population. The state-based Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was launched in 1984 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It deployed by each state and U.S. territory’s health departments in monthly progressions. The aim is to accrue a representative cross-section of the United States population from whom the survey extracts relevant health status, health-promoting behaviors, risk behavior, and demographic prevalence data.  Noninstitutionalized adults over 18 are qualified to participate. The states then turn over their data to CDC to be coded, weighted, aggregated and published by state. The BRFSS survey questionnaire has three components: (1) the core (further divided into: the fixed core, rotating core, and emerging core), (2) optional modules, and (3) state-specific questions. The fixed core includes questions that every state must ask all respondents, without modification. These include: demographics and health behaviors like tobacco and seatbelt use. The rotating core are modules used every other year. On off years, these modules are optional (and for that year, part of component 2). The emerging core includes up to five questions, distributed into the fixed and rotating core. The data solicited from emerging core questions are evaluated for research and social value, and a decision to permanently add or delete the emerging core question is made. The optional modules are voluntary, though if a state choses to deploy one or more, the modules must be used without deletion of individual questions or other modifications. Finally, there are state-specific questions. States are free to write and ask their own questions following CDC approval. Statistical hypotheses H0: There is no significant difference in demographics, health, and social outcomes within and between gender groups in the United States. H1: Transwomen, transmen and gender nonconforming people are at greater risk than cisgender men and women of engaging in risky   health behaviors, having a metabolic disorder and having a cardiovascular disease. H2: Transwomen, transmen and GNC people are not at equal risk for engaging in risky health behaviors, having a metabolic disorder and having a cardiovascular disease. H3: Straight, gay/lesbian and bisexual cisgender and transgender are distinct populations that do not experience the same number of days with (a) functional difficulty, (b) mental distress and (c) physical distress. H4: Distinct sexual minorities within gender minorities constitute distinct populations within gender groups that are not at equal risk for engaging in risky health behaviors, having a metabolic disorder and having a cardiovascular disease. H5: Transmen, transwomen and gender nonconforming people whose assigned sexes have been miscoded constitute a distinct population that are not at equal risk for engaging in risky health behaviors, having a metabolic disorder and having a cardiovascular disease. H6: “Passing” sexual minority transmen, transwomen and gender nonconforming people are not at equal risk for engaging in risky health behaviors, having a metabolic disorder and having a cardiovascular disease, as compared to “non-passing” sexual minority transgender people. Variables 1. Gender (Independent)  Survey respondents are asked, “Do you consider yourself to be transgender?” Only respondents who indicate that they are transgender are asked to supply their gender explicitly (as either MTF, FTM or GNC). That is, cisgender men and women’s genders are simply coded as  “not transgender”. Notably, the option to supply a nonbinary identity is unavailable; furthermore, the skip pattern of the survey is such that nonbinary people who do not identify as transgender are excluded a priori. For the purposes of this study, those respondents who indicated that they are both transgender and gender conforming are considered transgender nonbinary. “Don’t know/unsure” and “refused” responses were coded as “missing”.  2. Sex (Independent)  Approximately 1/3 of transgender respondents’ assigned sexes are, ostensibly, incorrectly coded; meaning, about 33% of transwomen are coded as having been assigned female at birth, and about 33% of transmen are coded as having been assigned male at birth. While there is a prompt script to solicit respondents’ sex (“What is your sex? or What was your sex at birth? Was it male or female?”) proctors rarely ask, opting to code each respondents’ sex based on vocal timber (Tordoff, et al. 2019). There is no option to indicate intersexuality. In this study, sex is used as an imperfect proxy for “passing”. Passing here means the state of being read as a cisgender woman, in the case of transwomen, and a cisgender man, in the case of transmen. That is, those 33% of transgender respondents whose voices are coded as the sex associated with their gender are analyzed as a distinct population among transgender people. “Don’t know/unsure” and “refused” responses were coded as “missing”.  3. Health-Related Quality of Life (Dependent)  The CDC maintains certain metrics across surveys, usually to highlight specific outcomes for public health initiatives. One of these consistent matrices is health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It is an index of: (1) number of days per month the respondent experiences activity limitation due to physical and/or mental illness, (2) number of days per month the respondent experiences physical distress, (3) number of days per month the respondent experiences psychological distress, (4) self-reported health as poor, fair, good, very good or excellent. “Don’t know/unsure” and “refused” (originally coded ‘7’ and ‘9’) responses were recoded as “missing”.    4. Health Behaviors (Dependent)  The minority stress model emphasizes the importance of personally applied mechanisms of physical and psychological distress/illness. The following behaviors—tobacco use, heavy drinking (having more than 4 drinks on the same occasion), lack of exercise, and HIV risk behaviors (survey prompt: “I am going to read you a list. When I am done, please tell me if any of the situations apply to you. You do not need to tell me which one. You have injected any drug other than those prescribed for you in the past year. You have been treated for a sexually transmitted disease or STD in the past year. You have given or received money or drugs in exchange for sex in the past year”)—are used to index personal-proximal minority stress mechanisms. “Don’t know/unsure” and “refused” responses were coded as “missing”.  5. Metabolic Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease (Dependent)  Due, in part, to the metabolic burden of medical transition, transsexual transgender people are vulnerable to metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including: (1) diabetes, (2) overweight and (3) obesity. “Don’t know/unsure” and “refused” responses were coded as “missing”.  6. Cardiovascular Disease (Dependent)  The adverse cardiovascular outcomes of interest in this study are: (1) diagnosis of coronary artery disease, (2) diagnosis of stroke and (3) myocardial infarction (heart attack). Coincidence of any of these three is, for the purposes of this study, I have coded separately as a fourth outcome: CVD comorbidity. “Don’t know/unsure” and “refused” responses were coded as “missing”.  7. Race/ethnicity (Control)  8. Population density (Control)  9. Education (Control)  10. Income (Control)  11. Marital status (Control)  12. Age (Control)  Statistical methods Data for this study come from the 2018 BRFSS. Analyses and data handling were conducted with SPSS 26.0 (IBM Corp, 2019) and RStudio (RStudio, Inc. 2020). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were conducted to compare demographic characteristics across genders: (a) cisgender men, (b) cisgender women, (c) transgender women (MTF), (d) transgender men (FTM), and (e) gender nonconforming people (GNC). Statistical significance was defined at an alpha level of 0.05, and post hoc analyses of between group differences were conducted with Tukey’s HSD (CI 95%).  Two hierarchal logistic multiple regression models of health behaviors, metabolic risk factors and cardiovascular events were constructed with cisgender male and cisgender female as respective reference categories for transgender women, transgender men and gender nonconforming people. Odds ratios were transformed with the Rao-Scott adjustment for complex survey designs, and statistical significance was defined at 95% confidence. An additional hierarchal logistic multiple regression model was constructed to compare the same variables between gender minorities. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were defined as significant at 95% confidence.  A generalized linear model of incidence of activity limitation, psychological distress, and physical distress was created by individually transforming the absolute values of the three dependent variables’ unstandardized residuals from multiple linear regression (controlling for race/ethnicity, age, income, education, population identity and employment status) into variables for an additional linear regression, from which standardized residuals were transformed into variable weights for the generalized linear model. Least square means   (LSM) are reported to account for unequal sample sizes (adjusted parameter estimate=LSM-intercept). Beta values were considered statistically significant at 95% confidence.  Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures, health behaviors, metabolic risk factors and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are compared between sexual and gender identity with three hierarchal logistic multiple regression models, with each accounting for one gender and its populations’ sexualities as (a) bisexual, (b) gay/lesbian and (c) straight. In each case, “straight” is the reference category (CI 95%).  Three Kruskal-Wallis one-way analyses of variance were conducted to compare mean incidence of (1) physical, mental and functional distress: indexed as HRQoL, (2) tobacco usage, heavy drinking, lack of exercise and HIV risk: indexed as risky health behaviors, (3) obesity, overweight and diabetes: indexed as metabolic CVD risk factors, and (4) comorbidity of coronary artery disease (angina), stroke and myocardial infarction: indexed as CVD comorbidity. Statistical significance was defined at 90% confidence, to account for disparate sex coding methods between states and survey proctors (Tordoff, et al. 2019).  Finally, HRQoL indicators, health behaviors, metabolic risk factors and cardiovascular events are analyzed across: (1) transgender men coded and male vs. transgender men coded as female, (2) transgender women coded as female vs. transgender women coded as male, and (3) gender nonconforming people coded female vs. gender nonconforming people coded male. Adjusted odds ratios are significant at 90% confidence. Results (1) Summary statistics1                                                           1 See statistical tables in appendix Cis and transgender men, women and GNC people differed across all racial categories, with cisgender people representing the least racially diverse population and transwomen representing the most racially diverse group. Transgender women and GNC people were the least white and most Hispanic. Genders also differed along all income levels with cisgender people earning the highest income, followed by transmen, GNC people and transwomen. Cisgender people were more educated than transgender people, and among transgender people, transgender women had the least schooling. Cisgender men and women were older than transgender people, and among transgender people, transmen and GNC were the youngest. Genders were equally likely to live in urban areas, with the exception of gender nonconforming people, who were significantly more likely to live in cities. Genders were equally likely to have children. All genders differed across marital status with transwomen being least likely to be currently coupled, and GNC people least likely to have ever been married or divorced. Transgender men abstained from answering prompts about marital status approximately seven times more often than all other genders.  Employment status differed across all genders. Most notably, transwomen, transmen and GNC people were all approximately twice as likely as cisgender people to be unable to work, despite being younger on average. All gender minorities were significantly less likely than cisgender men and women to have health insurance, and they were furthermore more likely to have delayed getting medical care due to cost. GNC people were least likely to be insured and most likely to have put off care because of cost. Genders were similar in satisfaction with healthcare received, with the exception of transwomen who were less satisfied than cisgender women.  Notably, approximately 50% of all transgender respondents did not supply an answer to this prompt. In terms of self-reported health, cismen   fared better than transwomen and GNC people. Ciswomen also reported better general health than did GNC people. Genders all differed significantly in physical, psychological and functional disability reporting, with GNC people reporting by far the worst outcomes, followed by transwomen and transmen. Genders differed significantly across all groups in prevalence of diagnosed depression. Again, GNC people reported the worst outcomes (38.6% respondents endorsed a diagnosis of depression), followed by transwomen (31.3%) and transmen (29.3%). (2) Between-group differences Tables 2 and 3 describe the key health outcomes measured across genders (with reference to cismen and ciswomen, respectively): health behaviors, metabolic risk factors and CVD conditions. In terms of health behaviors, the genders did not differ after adjustment beyond transwomen’s lesser incidence of binge drinking compared to cismen and GNC people’s lesser incidence of binge drinking compared to ciswomen. Metabolic risk factors slightly differed more. Transwomen were 30% more likely than cismen to be overweight, however they were also only 74% as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. Transmen were only 76% as likely as cismen to be obese. Cardiovascular disease prevalence differed between transmen and cisgender people, with transmen only 59% as likely to have experienced a stroke as cismen and 52% as likely as ciswomen. GNC people were 41% as likely as ciswomen to have had a heart attack. These final data points regarding CVD incidence alert me to the possibility that I may have under-corrected for age in this regression. Table 4 illustrates key outcome differences between gender minorities. Transwomen, transmen and GNC people did not differ significantly across health behaviors, metabolic risk and incidence of CVD aside from transmen who, compared to transgender women, were 199% more likely to binge drink and 151% more likely to engage in HIV risk behaviors. Table 5 details the generalized linear model of days with mental distress/month, days with physical distress/month and days with activity limitation/month between transgender sexual minorities. Of straight respondents, transmen and GNC people had 196% and 605% more days with mental distress (p=<0.001). Straight transmen and GNC people also have 224% and 2,731% more days with activity limitations than did straight cismen. Of gay/lesbian respondents, only GNC people differed from cismen; GNC people had 756% more days with mental distress and 832% more days with activity limitations than did gay cismen (<0.001). Outcomes for bisexual respondents were the most variable. Bisexual transmen and GNC people had 567% and 564% more days with mental distress than did bisexual cismen (p=<0.001). GNC bisexuals individually had almost twice as many days with physical distress as cisgender bisexual men. Transmen and GNC bisexuals had 729% and 822% more days with activity limitation than did cisgender bisexual men. Table 6 includes three logistic regression models of HRQoL, health behaviors, metabolic risk factors and CVD prevalence within gender groups by sexual orientation (1 model for GNC, FTM and MTF).  There was a stark difference between bisexual GNC people and straight GNC people; bisexual GNC people were: 44% as likely to experience frequent activity limitation (FAL), 20% as likely to experience frequent mental distress (FMD), 32% as likely to experience frequent physical distress (FPD), 47% as likely to report fair/poor health and 224% more likely to report being in very good/excellent health than straight GNC people. Bisexual GNC people were furthermore, only 20% as likely to engage in HIV risk behaviors, 52% as likely to have had a diagnosis of CAD, 91% as likely to have had a stroke and 32% as likely to have had any adverse cardiovascular events. Finally, bisexual GNC people were slightly more likely (107% as likely) to have a diagnosis of diabetes, compared to straight GNC people. Lesbian/gay and straight   GNC people did not significantly differ on any measure.  Bisexual and gay/lesbian transmen both differed significantly compared to straight transmen. Bisexual transmen were 32% as likely to experience FMD, while gay transmen were 286% as likely to experience FMD compared to straight transmen. Gay transmen were also 343% more likely than straight transmen to experience FAL. Bisexual transmen were only 40% as likely as straight transmen to have exercised in the past 30 days. Gay transmen were 539% more likely than straight transmen to have engage in HIV risk behaviors. Both bisexual and gay transmen fare better than straight transmen in terms of cardiovascular outcomes. Bisexual transmen are 56% and 70% less likely than straight transmen to have had a diagnosis of CAD and stroke respectively. Gay transmen are 48% less likely than straight transmen to have experienced a stroke.  Transwomen differed greatly across sexual orientation. Bisexual transwomen were 80% as likely to experience FMD, 118% as likely to report fair/poor health, 80% as likely to drink heavily, 55% as likely to engage in HIV risk behaviors, 111% as likely to be overweight, 133% as likely to have diabetes, 69% as likely to have had a stroke, 77% as likely to have had a heart attack, but 152% as likely to report a cardiovascular event compared to compared to straight transwomen. This final data point suggests that while bisexual transwomen are less likely to report each disease individually, they are significantly more likely than straight transwomen to have comorbid cardiovascular conditions. Lesbian transwomen were 365% as likely to experience FAL, 85% as likely to experience FPD, 63% as likely to be obese and 84% as likely to have diabetes compared to straight transwomen. (3) Within group sex differences Using the miscoding of sex assigned at birth as a proxy for passing, tables 7-9 compare ranked means on indices of HRQoL, risky health behaviors, metabolic CVD risk factors and CVD comorbidity between straight, gay/lesbian and bisexual gender minorities who pass and those who do not. Table 7 models transwomen, table 8 models transmen and table 9 models GNC people. Likely due in some part to poor index construction, only table 7 (passing MTF straights, lesbians and bisexuals) shows significant differences between male coded and female coded sexual minorities within gender minority groups. Passing bisexual transwomen had a 50% lower score on the HRQoL index (constructed such that lower scores reflect better outcomes) than non-passing transwomen. Passing transwomen also score 66% lower than non-passing women on the risky behavior index. Finally, passing transwomen score about 20 points lower on the metabolic risk factor index. Table 10 presents one logistic multiple regression model per gender minority category. It compares the entire passing and non-passing portions of each gender category across HRQoL, health behaviors, metabolic risk factors and CVD conditions. Taking each gender category as a whole, more significant differences emerge between passing and non-passing individuals, suggesting that it is not simply being a sexual minority that causes most stress but not passing. For example, passing transwomen are half as likely to report fair/poor health compared to non-passing transwomen. Non-passing transmen are almost four times as likely as passing transmen to engage in HIV risk behaviors and almost twice as likely to report a cardiovascular event, compared to passing transmen. Notably, non-passing transmen do not report any CVD in particular more than passing transmen do, suggesting that non-passing transmen experience CVD comorbidities at higher rates. GNC people coded female were 285% as likely and 194% as likely as GNC people coded male to drink heavily and to have exercised in the past month. Discussion In this analysis, I aimed to parse along which intersections of identity and demography did   somatic stress and transition-related stress manifest most strongly in the transgender population. A drawback to this approach is, of course, the implicit assumption that all stress that individuals at the various intersections we’ve highlighted experience is, in some way, related to trans-ness. However, given the equally private and public nature of gender, this isn’t an entirely outlandish assumption.  All six hypotheses are supported. The minority stress model also does not account for internalized transphobia and homophobia very well—that is, the internal stresses are mere byproducts of external, discriminatory stress. While it accounts in a limited sense for internalized transphobia and for denial/concealment, it does not theorize about the stress of coming out (and in doing so: asserting, managing and defending a marginalized and sometimes unfamiliar identity to strangers and close friends and family alike), and the existence of “part-time” transgender people (trans people who lead “double lives”, usually older transgender women). Worryingly, the failure to name gender dysphoria as a legitimate minority stressor seems to imply that it is a mechanism of internalized transphobia. Working with that implicit assumption is unhelpful and likely hurtful to (1) research partners, (2) research results and (3) future applicability of the model. Public health research does not fail to point out universally poor outcomes for transgender people, nor does it fail to mention the reticence of the community in the ‘limitations’ section of studies that make trans health outcomes their business, but in light of the findings of this paper, this oft-cited limitation sounds like latent transphobia; that is, as explained below, there is an overemphasis on the proximal psychological processes of minority stress—and the extent to which people can be expected to cope. In line with previous research, this analysis finds ample evidence of elevated risk-taking behavior and HRQoL disparities. It also finds, in congruence with a growing body of medical research, elevated metabolic and cardiovascular adverse outcomes in transgender people. While the link between medical transition and these outcomes requires little imagination, this paper is the first to my knowledge, to propose transition as a mechanism of minority stress. The major contribution of this research is in highlighting the heretofore glaring oversight of not making an attempt to differentiate between passing and non-passing transgender people. This study adds to the meager of extant research on differential health outcomes between sexual minorities who are also gender minorities. Furthermore, it attempts to parse differences in minority stress between sexual and gender minorities by comparing the convergence and divergence of both. Perhaps the most striking finding is that, in comparing sexual minority+gender minority passing/nonpassing folks with passing/nonpassing transgender people, it is not sexual minority stress that contributes to HRQoL, health behaviors, metabolic risk factors but passing or not passing.  Taking these proximal processes in account together with the obvious day to day safety passing offers, it seems that there is a steep minority stress burden gradient that falls mainly along an individual’s success in passing as their gender. This has profound implications for the transgender minority stress model in that, in establishing a scale along a sharp distinction between passing and not, it becomes clear that the proximal processes of internalized transphobia, hypervigilance, and concealment/denial contribute modestly indeed compared to the distal stressors such as outright violence, discrimination, harassment and transition. This seems to suggest that we have been overemphasizing individual agency in coping with minority stress by failing to study the most direct, distal minority stress processes. Interestingly, sexuality seems to contribute to CVD outcomes particularly in transmen and transwomen. Most notably, while bisexual transwomen and transmen experience worse outcomes in risk taking behaviors and HRQoL,   their CVD outcomes are significantly better than their straight counterparts, which could possibly suggest that bisexual binary transgender people are less likely to pursue medical transition. In doing so, they avoid the adverse CVD impacts but experience worse proximal minority stress processes compared to their counterparts who do pursue medical transition and therefore have more success passing. Finally, this analysis aligns with ample existing research that highlights the apparent extra minority stress burden that bisexual individuals carry relative to their monosexual counterparts—with respect to binary transgender people. With respect to GNC transgender people, however, monosexual people (gays/lesbians/heterosexuals) fare significantly worse in terms of indicators of psychological stress, likely linked to discrimination. Finally, perhaps least theoretically fruitful but most medically concerning, the observation that bisexual transwomen and non-passing transmen have elevated rates of comorbid cardiovascular disease warrants prompt investigation. Future quantitative research directions The broadest recommendation to be made is for CDC to ask respondents, in every nationwide survey, to report both their sex and their gender. Transgender inclusion in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in particular would be an invaluable asset to transgender research as it the only nationally representative survey that includes biometric data. This biometric data would likely make targeted research of the burden of medical transition possible on a national and regional level. Medical burdens of particular interest are cardiovascular outcomes of hormone replacement treatment (HRT), inflammatory conditions triggered or exacerbated by gender affirming surgery, musculoskeletal damage caused by binding/tucking, and the metabolic and musculoskeletal effects of compulsive exercise.  Possible within the constraints of BRFSS variables is a population comparison of transgender individuals who report above average rates of exercise. Variations in testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections across gender identity among transgender and cisgender LGB individuals, too, is possible. Stephenson et al have conducted similar experiments with a subset of Project Moxie respondents, demonstrating a significant difference between rates of testing (Stephenson et al 2019). McDowell et al, utilizing a community sample of 150 transmasuline individuals in Boston, have shown a correlation between days per month of poor mental health (McDowell et al). Their data is particularly valuable in comparing regional and nationwide population data in that it uses the same variables that the BRFSS telephone interview do. To fellow researchers, statistical recommendations are limited to either finding latent quantitative indicators of transgender minority stress in existing datasets or compiling original survey data. Tordoff et al and Swartz et al have done clever statistical work to this end, utilizing quantitative bias modeling and latent class analysis respectively to reveal otherwise invisible emergent trends in available data. Carceres et al have analyzed prevalence of cardiovascular disease by gender identity in the US. Between-group analysis reveals the magnitude of the phenomenon. Within-group analysis defines the character. Particular attention should be paid to the differences between cisgender LGB individuals, heterosexual transgender individuals, and LGB transgender individuals. These comparisons will allow for a nuanced model of transgender minority stress not complicated by baseline LGB minority stress. Furthermore, comparisons between LGB trans individuals and straight trans individuals may improve estimations of proximal minority stress (through processes of internalized stigma and hypervigilance) and distal minority stress via the assumed   membership of transgender individuals in a LGB population. Given the unique processes of transgender minority stress and available data, I recommend greater attention to incidence of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. In particular within-group comparisons of transgender individuals who have and have not received exogenous hormones is necessary. Out of available data in BRFSS, CVD and metabolic variables represent the greatest opportunity to not only demonstrate differential transgender cardiovascular health outcomes but also to develop a metabolic/cardiovascular model of minority stress vis a vis the physical burden of medical transition.     PART II “The world in which most of us live is lacking a comfortable and familiar human shape. At least one source of body alienation in advanced industrial societies is the symbolic equation of humans and machines, originating in our industrial modes and relations of production and in the commodity fetishism of modern life, in which even the human body has been transformed into a commodity.” Scheper-Hughs and Lock, 1987 “The body, one might say, is not so much a thing as an -ing. That is, not simply the inert objects on which mind and culture perform their meaning making, bodies take shape and take place through practices of all sorts: feeding, legislating, training, cutting, explaining, beating, loving, diagnosing, buying, selling, dressing, and healing, among others.” Taylor, 2005 Introduction Transgender people have the greatest stake in appropriate public health research and its downstream policy effects. Queer people writ large benefit from scholarly attention to LBGTQIA+ health. Clear theoretical work paves the way for clean, relevant statistical work. Public health research as a field benefits directly from good data. Public health policy benefits from clear conclusions. Real people’s lives are improved by smart public policy. As such, appropriate quantitative minority stress indicators particular to transgender population health must be identified via theoretical understanding of the phenomenon. Quantitative models should not merely prove the relevance of the LGB minority stress model to transgender minority stress. Mutual, iterative influence and remodeling is necessary.  If one accepts that there are significant differences between transgender minority stress experiences and those studied in general minority stress models, one should then acknowledge that transgender public health research must aim to define and characterize unique indicators of transgender population health. That is, it is not enough to use the same analytic matrices for transgender people and their LGB counterparts; if transgender minority                                                           2 See diagram 1 for sex-based BRFSS question skip patterns stress is unique, it will not be uncovered using the same strategies as are appropriate for a different population. The dearth of data on transgender people’s health and lives complicates this task. Only two nationwide public health surveys ask respondents to report both their sex and their gender—the National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (Patterson et al). Meaning, only two nationally representative datasets containing information on U.S. transgender population health exist. Furthermore, these surveys exist to assess bad behavior across demographic identifiers. That is, our best tools to identify transgender minority stress are inherently punitive. Discouragingly, the BRFSS interview protocol excludes transgender respondents from sex-based health questions (ex. reproductive health, prostate health etc.), suggesting significant selection bias in the data (Tordoff et al 2019)2. Worse yet, telephone interview protocol is inconsistent in coding for sex; most interviewers coded sex based on the vocal timber of the respondent instead of asking outright. (Tordof et al 2019). Virtually any public health research involving transgender respondents that, inevitably, observes a disproportionate distribution of   negative health outcomes and ‘risky behaviors’ in transgender populations reads this data as supporting the Minority Stress model. This is where the theoretical contributions stop when analyses rely on the indicators unique to sexual minorities—not gender minorities. Meaning, we can recognize Minority Stress once it’s happened, based on outcomes. But the Minority Stress model isn’t all that informative here.  We can watch the news and see that transgender people (particularly Black transwomen, who are murdered at alarming rates) have it tough more frequently than the general population, and it isn’t hard to correlate their minority status with their poor outcomes. But what are the predictors for Minority Stress that’s significant enough to consistently produce these results—the threshold velocity of discrimination so to speak? Transmasculine, transfeminine and genderqueer people experience their trans-ness very differently, and so, in turn, do their communities and their oppressors (Bry et al 2018).  How do these factors sink into a physiology to produce a pathology in a trans/nonbinary body? Not every transgender person smokes, has unprotected sex and has been homeless; there is not an even minority stress burden across the transgender population (Katz-Wise et al., 2017). Clearly there must exist protective and/or predictive factors in individual responses to Minority Stress in the transgender population (Breslow 2015). If we can identify these factors, we can—instead of merely observing that transgender respondents are stressed out, unhealthy and unsafe— make actionable public health recommendations toward the betterment of trans lives to policymakers, community leaders and individuals. The transgender minority stress model is incomplete Minority stress theory is a synthesis of multiple psychological, medical and sociological theories. Of these, stress theory is the most foundational. In psychological literature, stress theory deals with external events that exceed an individual’s capacity to endure, thereby increasing the likelihood of adverse health outcomes. These events might include: loss of job, loss of home, or the death of a loved one. An extension of stress theory—social stress theory— suggests that both personal events and social conditions are stressors that can cause physical and mental distress. These social conditions might include: air quality, workplace culture, economic depression, poor infrastructure, and war. However, social stress burden is not evenly distributed. The minority stress theory attempts to conceptualize these slopes of social status along which social stress accelerates. Minority stress theory is an elaboration of social stress theory. It attempts to conceptually distinguish the excess stress experienced by minorities from the social stress endured by the general population. These stressors might include: racism, colorism, sexism, homophobia or transphobia. These stressors are actively harmful in isolation, however they also exacerbate the effects of the existing stressors experienced by the general population. For example, minorities might be forced into living in areas with the poorest air quality due to discriminatory redlining. Not all exacerbations of social stress are so clearly traceable. For example, minorities might feel greater coercive pressure to serve in the military, in order to obtain access to the VA and the monetary and academic benefits of the GI Bill. That is, the existence of a guarded social support unintentionally pressures minority people to exchange risk to their lives for future social safety. These individual exacerbations of existing social stressors pose disproportionate threats to the health, life, lifetime earnings, and security of minority individuals. In a person’s daily life, these stressors might manifest in insidious, difficult to prove social evils such as redlining, oppressive social policy, discriminatory dress codes, and culturally biased standardized testing. Notably, a person does not need to be aware of discrimination to be   effected; for example, it would be hard to know whether or not one did not get a job position because of discrimination. These stressors significantly impact the minority person’s life trajectory, notably resulting in substantial pay gaps, disproportionate use of healthcare, and underemployment. These disadvantages often lead to not only to poorer physical and mental health but pervasive social anomie—which further de-incentivizes participation in traditionally profitable, healthful, and culturally valued behaviors. The minority stress model is an essentially interdisciplinary concept; it is “inferred” from psychological, sociological and medical theory (Meyer 2009). That is, it attempts to name the black box through which poor psychological, social and medical outcomes are elevated in populations with minority social status. Transgender minority stress is distinct from pantheoretical minority stress models. Legitimization and upkeep of a trans/nonbinary person’s gender involves (1) legal, medical, and psychological gatekeeping, (2) internalized stigma compounded by self-surveillance of “passing”, and, in many cases, (3) the physical burden of medical transition. Aside from these unique stressors, transgender people experience the same minority stress triggers as their sexual minority counterparts (with significant overlap). Furthermore, engaging legal, medical, and psychological gatekeepers necessarily involves (1) outing oneself, (2) the accumulation of traceable—often notarized— documentation of a person’s birth name/transgender status, and (3) documented acceptance of gender dysphoria as a pathology—thus opening oneself to discrimination, harassment, further public outing, refusal of services, direct violence, and greater internalized stigma. There are philosophical and political implications in the epistemological positioning of minority stress research; subjective coping models imply that it is up to the individual to withstand the stress of discrimination, whereas, objective process-based models that highlight the characteristics of the stressful conditions and events imply that the minority person is a hapless victim of discrimination. Questions related to the conceptualization of the minority person arise from these distinctions: are they a resilient agent, or are they a passive victim? The fact remains that discrimination is stressful regardless of individual ability to cope. That is, it is unproductive to conceptualize minority stress as dependent on or determined by coping abilities; such a concept would by definition consider events for which a person has developed effective coping objectively non-stressful. The feel-good narrative of the resilient minority actor is therefore, not useful on a theoretical level. It is exclusive and complicates meaningful examination of the stressors themselves; it is, after all, the fault of discrimination that transgender people suffer—not inadequate coping. There’s a difference between experiences of individual and structural discrimination that are especially important in minority stress models. Lives are changed by structural discrimination beyond the scope of individual awareness; that is, one needn’t know that they’ve been passed over for promotion to be financially, physically effected. To holistically model the impacts of minority stress, this paper deals with minority stress on a population level. The interdisciplinary legibility of the minority stress model is troubled by whether minority stress happens to an individual or to a population. This conceptual difficulty may stem from the differing interests of its principal theorists—psychologists and physicians (clinical, individual level) and sociologists (social, population level).  Minority stress is (a) unique (surplus to stress experienced by others); minority persons are subject to effort above that required of non-stigmatized people; (b) chronic—has to do with social constructs and cultural structures and is therefore durable over time and (c) socially based— stems from structures beyond the individual events of conditions that characterize   the general stressors or biological genetic or other nonsocial characteristics of the group (Meyer 2003). Previous models of lesbian, gay and bisexual minority stress have proposed three processes of stress relevant to LGB individuals. These are, from most distal to most proximal, “(a) external, objective stressful events and conditions (chronic and acute), (b) expectations of such events and the vigilance this expectation requires, and (c) the internalization of negative societal attitudes” (Meyer 2009) (Kelleher 2009) (Staples et al 2018).  Tension between concealment and disclosure of LGB status is theorized to play a part in poor LGB health as well (Bry et al 2018). That is, while concealment of LGB status may protect an individual from direct discrimination, it also prevents them from gaining access to social support from other LGB individuals; an intense risk-benefit analysis of ‘coming out’ is a prerequisite to membership in a broader LGB community. Furthermore, full control of this risk-benefit analysis is rarer for transgender people than it is for LGB people. That is, there are more or less consistent physical characteristics that people in the same culture use to externally evaluate gender, while there is not usually a well-defined subset of gay, bisexual, or lesbian traits that would effectively out an LGB individual despite their hypothetical effort to pass as straight. For transgender people, this effort to pass is not always rewarded. In general, gender is determined physically as opposed to behaviorally or verbally. An individual’s open self-identification as a woman might not be prioritized by observers over her physical traits. That is, external observation of one’s body shape, stature, body hair, hairline, vocal pitch, and facial structure can usurp the possibility of the transgender person concealing their identity at all. Furthermore, gender-affirming manipulation of these gendered characteristics is influenced by factors that the transgender personal has limited power over: genetics, wealth, healthcare access, age, and health. A transgender minority stress model is incomplete without a model of transphobia Theorists must do the work of integrating mind and body in conceptualizing trans-ness. The ubiquitous Cartesian dualism of mind and body gets in the way of understanding and bettering the lives of transgender people. This false ontological divide is exacerbated by the pressure on transgender individuals to “prove” the legitimacy of their gender by alluding to an internal, nonphysical aspect of their being within which their gender resides. Thus trans-ness is often conceived of as a fact of the mind—as if the mind is somehow separate from the more legitimate, more tangible, body. If the two are separate, then trans-ness if a fact of both mind and body.  Transgender minority stress research is overwhelmingly produced by clinicians—both psychologists and physicians. That is, transgender minority stress has been studied overwhelmingly as pathology of the individual. Sociological syntheses have been attempted but fail to effectively extrapolate from the individual body to the social body. No real attempt has been made to socially characterize the impetus of transgender minority stress— transphobia itself. An anthropological synthesis of transgender minority stress would involve a conceptual and causal analysis of the genesis and correlation of these phenomena. That is, an anthropological synthesis of transgender minority stress does not rely on the misery of the individual to supply the theory. Rather, it relies on the motivation, intent, action, and actions of the oppressor to supply a theoretical backbone. This paper synthesizes anthropological theories of gender, sex, syndemic, somaticization, biopolitics, and anatomopolitics. It is not the job of medical anthropology to suggest a clinical framework. My aim is not to offer clinical advice. I will not be writing about the resilience of the transgender agent. I will not be writing about coping. I am writing about the agency of the oppressors and of the state. These   are the appropriate sites of problematization and criticism. The coping strategies of individual transgender people are irrelevant to the development of a concept of transphobia; theories of coping and resilience are best dealt with by the psychologists and physicians who have already done the initial work of proposing a unique transgender minority stress model. This paper, therefore, is about transphobia and its inevitable biological result—transgender minority stress. Anthropology is considered a discipline that deals in culture. More profoundly, it deals with structures. This paper is not about building the reader’s cultural competence. This paper is about building the reader’s structural competence. Transphobia is not a culture failure, it is the inevitable result of bad infrastructure. The social determinants of health are not unevenly distributed merely due to discriminatory cultural attitudes. They are mechanistically informed at the macrolevel, distributed at the mesolevel, and observed on the microlevel. Even in the sudden, hypothetical absence of harmful social attitudes, the uneven distribution of the social determinants of health would continue. Thus, a structurally competent, rather than culturally competent, model of transphobia and transgender minority stress is presented in this paper. Historically, processes of minority stress have been situated on a continuum of proximity to the minority individual, from most distal (external discriminatory action), to most proximal (internalized stigma). An anthropological synthesis would be careful to avoid overemphasis on the concept of distal and proximal factors of transgender minority stress, as proposed in Meyer’s foundational LGB minority stress model (Meyer 2003). All stress processes are proximal and bodily; they require the body’s allostatic machinery to return to equilibrium. It is pressure that is distal. That is, transgender minority stress is of the individual body, and transphobia is of the social body. The machinations of transphobia are of the body politic. A hallmark of queer minority stress theories is the process of internalized homo/transphobia. However, there has heretofore been no attempt to characterize what structural anxieties, exactly, the transgender minority person is apparently absorbing. What phobia, or set of phobias, underpins transgender discrimination? How is this phobia internalized by the social body? And, finally, how does the individual body absorb this anxiety? I conceptualize five processes of transgender minority stress. I additionally propose five corresponding processes of structural transphobia. Minority stress is comprised of (a) discriminatory events and conditions (b) vigilance, (c) internalized stigma, (d) concealment and (e) delegitimization. Transphobia operates on state-level processes of (a) a sublimated eugenics program, (b) the breeding and domestication of a docile, homogenous population, (c) capitalist labor force management, (d) the policing of normative sex and reproduction, and (e) maintenance of the medical power of disenfranchisement.  Existing models of objectification theory may aid in robustly defining the minority stress processes concealment and delegitimization (Velez 2016). Objectification theory constructs, historically applied to straight cisgender women, include: internalization of sociocultural standards of attractiveness (SSA), body satisfaction, and body surveillance. Internalization of SSA has been shown to significantly predict compulsive exercise. Antitransgender discrimination has been shown to elevate all three constructs of objectification theory, though transgender congruence (the sense of one’s body aligning with their gender identity) has been shown to mediate the magnitude of these effects (Velez 2016). These processes are correlated with higher levels of eating disorders and depressive disorders. Internal processes of sexual objectification are determined by societal sexism, which in turn amplifies sexual objectification. Instances of dehumanization via sexual objectification   encourage internal acceptance of sociocultural standards of attractiveness. The belief that one must to be sexually desirable to be valued is an implicit in sociocultural standards of attractiveness. Internalization of SSA leads to greater self-objectification which manifests behaviorally through body surveillance, disordered eating3 (Velez et al 2016). Thus, the transgender individual is the body politic’s unwilling accomplice in internalizing, enacting, and embodying stigma.  I define legitimization as the process of both internally and externally validating one’s gender identity. One might internally validate their gender by socially and/or medically transitioning. One might externally validate their gender by proactively and reactively asserting their gender identity, by seeking community with other transgender people, by seeking positive transgender representation in media, by engaging legislation that acts on transgender bodies (Breslow et al 2015). The process of internal validation is unique to transgender people.  Concealment and legitimization are processes unique to transgender populations. While concealment has been proposed as a process of minority stress for LGB people, concealment of transgender status is phenomenologically distinct and thus requires separate conceptual development. That is, concealing one’s sexual orientation and concealing one’s transgender status are entirely different processes. It is further worth noting that these separate processes of concealment can occur in the same person. This is particularly important to consider in theorizing about the social determinants of health in populations that are both sexual and gender minorities. Transgender minority stress is a syndemic A syndemic is a synergistic epidemic within a population resulting from mutual interaction and                                                           3 See diagram two for self-objectification processes of minority stress compounding of multiple health issues; meaning, a syndemic involves a disease cluster as opposed to a singular disease outcome (Bauer et al 2016). Syndemics are further distinct from epidemics in that they are definitionally created and enhanced by social inequity with and between populations, in a cycle of mutual reinforcement. (Bauer et al 2016). Within group inequity may be distributed along lines of class, age, gender, sexuality and race. These differential disease burdens are produced and delivered via structural inequities. Evidence from psychiatric nosology and affective-cognitive neuroscience suggests that minority stress may engender syndemic risk among sexual minorities by disrupting psychophysiological pathways governing stress-related processes crucial to self-regulation of emotion and behavior (Choi 2020). Research into the syndemic behavior of transphobia is mostly limited—as is the case with a large portion of queer health literature—to analysis of HIV risk factors. This emphasis has unfortunately prevented deeper analysis of transphobia-specific social condition and disease clusters. Scheer offers a conservative syndemic model of non-HIV physical health conditions related to syndemic conditions. These syndemic outcomes are: (1) migraines, (2) respiratory problems, (3) diabetes, (4) cardiovascular disease, (5) arthritis, and (6) stomach ulcers (enteritis and colitis). Predictor variables of syndemic: (1) intimate partner violence (IPV), (2) sexual assault, (3) depression, (4) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and (5) substance use. Individuals with one of the syndemic conditions exhibited 1.35 times more risk for physical health conditions than those with none. Individuals with two syndemic conditions exhibited 1.85 times greater risk for physical health conditions than those with none. Those with three syndemic conditions exhibited 2.15 times greater risk for physical health conditions than those with none. Those with four   syndemic conditions exhibited 2.56 times greater risk for physical health conditions than those with none. Those with five syndemic conditions exhibited 2.76 times greater risk for physical health (Scheer 2019). The biological facts of transgender minority stress are not incidental Seemingly incidental downstream effects of discriminatory policy are not meaningless; they reflect what the body politic wishes to both permit and promote. Poor cardiovascular outcomes are not incidental collateral. Systematic barriers to transgender reproductive health services are not an accident—they serve a sublimated eugenics agenda. Transgender morbidity and mortality is not only acceptable, but encouraged. Lower health insurance coverage, lack of enabling factors, and low healthcare utilization are not accidents of prejudice, they are goals. Perpetuation, reproduction, and enactment are purposeful components of the advancement of the surveillance state and should be analyzed as such. Between group health and social outcome comparisons are enough to infer transgender minority stress. Between group comparisons most eloquently characterize the movements and priorities of transphobia itself. The racial gradient of transgender minority stress reflects the special effort of the social body to suppress and subdue non-white bodies. That is, non-normatively gendered people of color represent a unique threat to the ideological hegemony of whiteness and thus experience disproportionate within-group transgender minority stress. Minority identity is not only a source of stress but an important effect modifier (Thoits 1999). Theories of embodiment and local biologies are biologically underpinned by allostatic activity; allostatic activity—the mammalian stress response—is the process by which mammals react to environmental stressors such that survival rate is maximized and somatic damage is minimized (Gallo 2014) (Buckwalter 2016). Meaning, any non-lethal extrinsic threat is somaticized by allostatic activity. The net physiologic effect of repetitive deployment of allostatic responses over the life course is called an individual’s allostatic load (Seeman 2014). Excessive allostatic activity is the mechanism by which the socioenvironment sinks into, solidifies, and festers in an individual’s body. Populations over social space and time differ in the burden of their allostatic loads.  These differences are evident in disproportionate (1) life-style illness prevalence, (2) somatic illness prevalence, and (3) mental illness prevalence. That is, there is an observable biology of discrimination. Biological expression of discrimination refers to how people literally embody and biologically express experiences of oppression and resistance from conception to death, thereby producing sex, sexuality, and gender disparities in morbidity and mortality across a wide spectrum of outcomes (Stephan et al 2016). These poor outcomes are often personally absorbed as a false choice between “outness” and health/safety. That is, transgender people are socially pressured to conceal their identities to preserve their bodies, however, the requisite hypervigilance and behavioral masking is also catastrophic to the individual body.  There is evidence to suggest that the excessive allostatic activity associated with hypervigilance is related to personality warping. Individuals exposed to high levels of allostatic stress experienced personality changes in the form of higher neuroticism, lower extraversion, lower conscientiousness, and lower agreeableness over four years (Stephan et al 2016). That is, hypervigilance is more than an activity—it is a trait. Worth noting is the fact that these traits of hypervigilance are, in fact, adaptive; higher anxiety, less willingness to interact, less willingness to put in effort, less agreeableness are all reasonable responses to victimization. Per symbolic interaction theory—the concept that people derive meaning to their worlds from the social environment—prejudice is particularly noxious for disenfranchised groups.    An individual’s interactions with society inform their concept of the world; health is jeopardized when this information is antithetical to the individual’s experience of the world. Social and physical anomie. That is, one’s reputation, true or not, “cannot be hammered into one’s head without doing something to one’s character” (Meyer 2003). The policing of normative sex and reproduction uniquely impacts transgender via overt denial of identity. Outright refusal to use chosen name and pronouns is the obvious case, but unintentional misgendering is the prime example of unwitting population-level enactment of the priorities of the body politic. The socially entrenched difficulty of adapting gendered pronoun and name usage to unexpected gender presentations is hidden policing by the body politic, enacted by often unwitting individuals. That is, even unintentionally, a transgender person’s legitimacy, personhood, and safety can be threatened via societal internalization of sex and gender norms. That is, someone can be swiftly and easily upended a transgender individual’s identity and safety with very little consequence beyond being corrected. The cumulative effect of these corrections has the potential to aid the well-intentioned social agent in internalizing acceptance of non-normative gender variance. However, it is up to the transgender individual to mount these responses, often in unpredictable circumstances. This is an example of pushback of the individual body against the pressure of the social body.  The effort to conceal an essential is so consuming that it can lead to intrusive thoughts about it—cognitive burden associated with the conscious and unconscious process that are necessary to maintain secrecy regarding one’s stigma. People who need to constantly monitor how they dress, how they talk, how they walk to avoid possible detection also need to limit their friends their interests and their expression for fear of being found guilty by association. Each act of “deception”, each moment of monitoring that which is unconscious and automatic for the majority behaviorally, psychologically, and physically internalizes the belief in one’s essential difference and inferiority (Hetrick and Martin 1987). These repetitive repressions and inhibitions lead to poor health outcomes and are, significantly, somaticized in immunosuppression.  For transgender minorities, vigilance is two-fold: vigilance of the gendered body and vigilance of the oppressive other. This two-fold vigilance is chronic; it is a fact of the transgender person’s daily experience. Hypervigilance is a channel through which the presence of an oppressor is not necessary for the transgender person to be subject to transphobia. It is a form of externally enforced self-policing. Branscombe et al describe four processes of stereotype threat that do the work of conjuring a spectral stigmatizer to do the work of the body politic through the transgender person’s own individual body: (1) categorization threat: being categorized as a part of a group without against will (especially when transgender status should be irrelevant—for example, applying for housing), (2) distinctiveness threat: denial of distinct group membership, (3) threat to value of social identity: unfavorable external judgement of individual character based on assumed group membership, and (4) threat to acceptance: negative feedback from one’s in-group (Branscombe et al 1999).  Meyer describes two additional processes of vigilance that are especially noxious to a minority’s social relationships: firstly, the minority person is self-protective and hyper aware of potential discrimination, leading to distrustfulness of even well-meaning others, secondly, the minority person engages in self-gaslighting. That is, to avoid “false alarms” that could rock the boat in important relationships and social settings, minority individuals tend to maximize their own sense of self-control in ambiguous situations by minimizing recognition of discrimination (Meyer 2003). Stigma/stereotype threat is “a social-psychological threat that arises when one is in a   situation for which a negative stereotype about one’s group applies” (Steele 1997). Because transphobia is a structural fact, its commentary omnipresent, it not necessary that a stigmatizer be present in order for a situation to be othering and discriminatory; “the threat is in the air” (Steele 1997).  Taking the minority stress model into consideration, the inflammatory response pathways that account for stress somatization burn well-worn paths of structural violence into transgender bodies, and those paths lead to poorer and poorer health (Castagné 2018). The stressors that prompt these swift, repetitive physiological responses are the result of both the interpersonal acting out of prejudice and refracted structural heteronormativity. The most common age-related diseases—high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and heart disease—are frequently termed “lifestyle” diseases. These lifestyle diseases, particularly obesity, are conceptualized as uniquely subject to moral judgement (Saguy 2010). That is, these are diseases that are frequently read as natural consequences of poor impulse control, laziness and gluttony. The imagined direct link between behavior and disease is reified not only in the name, “lifestyle disease”, but in medical practice; the standard of care suggesting the first and only preventative/remedial measure for metabolic disorder is to prescribe diet and exercise changes reinforces the notion that a societal problem is to be solved with individual discipline. This notion synergizes with the latent belief in medical science that being transgender is a choice in itself, which implies that these poor health outcomes are electively avoidable. Despite notable effort within psychiatric medicine, transgenderism retains the association of being a lifestyle choice. Because of the transgender person’s presumed agency over their minority status, the undue exaggeration of human agency in preventing and healing from disease de-incentivizes broader, more equitable public health measures and research (Stephan 2016). That is, the more frequently individual people are viewed as culpable for their diseases—in this case, their disproportionate suffering— the less motivated policymakers and biomedicine writ large is to suggest interventions addressing the upstream causes of the disease burden divide. Notably, transgender people are more frequently committed to in-patient psychiatric care involuntarily (Bishoy 2019). Transgender individuals are also more frequently—2.5 times more— diagnosed with psychotic disorders than cisgender patients (Bishoy 2019). Not controlling for admission type, race, age, income, hospital, hospital region, baseline comorbidities, payer status, substance abuse, and gender affirming surgery, the incidence rises to 3.9 times more. Furthermore, compared to cisgender schizophrenia patients, transgender schizophrenia patients are more frequently prescribed first generation (typical) antipsychotics than second generation (atypical) antipsychotics (Phillips 2015). Neuroleptics as a class are associated with massive weight gain and sedation among other deeply troubling (and often disabling) side effects—first generation antipsychotics even more so than second generation. Furthermore, the associated weight gain is dosage dependent. Meaning, a transgender person exhibiting any variety of mental illness is more likely than a cisgender person to be prescribed a neuroleptic; a transgender person diagnosed with schizophrenia is prescribed more drug than a cisgender person with schizophrenia; a transgender person with schizophrenia is prescribed the most sedating and disabling option (notoriously, haloperidol and chlorpromazine). The upstream determinant—the state’s domestication project—incidentally contributes to greater prevalence of obesity in transgender Americans. The metabolic stress of obesity has further downstream effects such as adverse cardiovascular events, stroke and diabetes. This is a small example of a medical standard of care that reinforces transgender   vulnerability to age-related disease in the service of institutional transphobia. There are more; the sheer number is enough to grossly overdetermine the gender disease burden disparity. The iatrogenic violence of metabolic disorder, sedation, severe movement disorders and impaired cognition is not merely collateral (Juster 2010) (Schenk 2018)—but a goal. Antipsychotics have always been marketed to sedate dangerous, non-white, non-Western bodies and ideas. Furthermore, subversive social behaviors have been historically been pathologized as psychotic in nature—known as “protest psychosis”4 (Metzl 2009). An individual’s shortage or wealth of discipline is irrelevant in the face of a sublimated medical desire to sedate socially dangerous patients (Fullwiley 2017).  Inferred biological differences between race and sex to different standards of pharmaceutical development and medical treatment (Roberts 2011) (Mark 2002). That is, while white cisgender, normatively sexed bodies continue to be the default bodies, transgender bodies are further distanced from model humanity by regulatory refusal to generalize clinical standards of care for the general population to transgender patients. That is, cisgender patients—believed to have the normative bodies—are treated as the default while transgender patients—believed to deviant bodies—are considered dubious and receive treatment plans on an ad hoc basis. These upstream biases result in significantly skewed (and avoidable) morbidity and mortality among transgender patients seeking care. The biological facts of transgender minority stress are moments of somatic resistance Transgender individuals surface their own bodies performativity, decoratively, and behaviorally. That is, they develop a social skin that expresses the “imprinting of social                                                           4 See images 1 and 2 categories on the body” (Scheper-Hughs and Lock 1987). This skin is both self-contrived, self-loving and affirmative, and other-imposed, social violence impressed upon the body. Resistance and responses to this violence are constructions and expressions of self-identities as well as other-imposed identities. The surface of the transgender body is a “symbolic stage” upon which the drama of gender, sex, and sexuality is problematized, enacted, and fought over. Individual bodies are metonymies of the body politic. The body is, after all, the ultimate cultural metaphor. Thus, transgender bodies are embodied gender metaphors.  A now-classic model of the body in medical anthropology is articulated by Nancy Schepper-Hughes and Margaret Lock in ‘The Mindful Body’ (Scheper-Hughes and Lock 1987). They conceive of the human—the mindful body— as a synthesis of three bodies: (1) the physical body, (2) the social body, and (3) the body politic. This three body synthesis is a particularly powerful heuristic in understanding transgender minority stress. These three bodies comprise three units of analysis and three different epistemologies. These three units of analysis can be turned toward public health epistemologies. Consider these three bodies three springs. The first, the physical body, is made of the highest gauge wire. The second, the social body, is a middling gauge. The third, the body politic, is a spring of the lowest, most rigid gauge. They are stacked atop one another, with the physical body on the bottom. The body politic is on top. Together, the three are a compensatory system of pressure distribution. Relatively powerless, the docile body at the bottom suffers the weight, interests, fears, and retaliations of the larger bodies. The second body, via cultural making and re-making, accommodates the interests, retaliations, weight, and fears of the body politic. To a lesser extent, it accommodates the subtle pushback from the individual bodies   below. These burdens compress its coil. The compression it cannot bear reaches equilibrium chiefly in the compression of the individual body. At the same time, it pushes back, gingerly, against the heavy gauge of the body politic. The individual body, likewise, pushes against the ambivalent bodies atop it. The pressure it exerts against the social body is infinitesimally transferred to the body politic itself. Meaning, that even though the individual body can, in fact, pressure the body politic, its resistance is essentially mediated—it must be managed and transmuted by the social body before it reaches the body politic. Its arsenal to push back includes—as well documented by medical anthropologists before me—(1) the somatization of untenable social pressure, the literal transmutation of inequality in the body, (2) the weapons of the weak—as characterized by political scientists before me, and (3) conscious manipulation of the individual “social skin”. Somatization is a process of internal sense-making about indefensible social conditions as well as a bodily protest against them. Social protest… is often expressed through this medium. Why this person, of all people? Why this particular disease? Why this particular organ or system? Why this \"choice\" of symptoms? Why now? (Scheper-Hughes and Lock 1987) A classic example of the somatization of untenable social—specifically sexual— dictates on individual bodies is feminine hysteria. Hysteria has historically been known also, tellingly, as the “suffocation of the mother” (Merskey 1993). Its name in clinical settings is transparently suggestive as well: “classical conversion.” Intentionally or not, the name serves as a diagnosis both of the individual and of the social body. Clinical presentation of classical conversion typically includes catatonia without psychosis, sometimes known as somatic paralysis (Lehembre-Shiah et al 2017). Symptoms resolve with social intervention (Ding 2016). This clinical insight has led to the hypothesis that hysteria is a rebellion against—a complete refusal to participate in—unreasonable social dictates (McLean 2013). In exchange, to be accused of hysteria was to lose credibility as a reasonable contributor and participant in the body politic. This is an extreme example of the allostatic warping of personality resulting in diminished agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness. This kind of refusal by negation is a classic “weapon of the weak” (Scott 1985). That is, when other options for resistance are beyond one’s reach, tactics of extreme disobedience/refusal to participate are favored. As is often the case, this psychiatric insight came far after literary analysis of the condition. Tellingly, these literary analysis frequently center on themes of sexuality and reproduction. Extra-psychiatric post-partum depression is frequently used as literary shorthand for the horror of female family life, as in Perkins Gilman’s novella The Yellow Wallpaper and Plath’s poem Edge. Catatonic hysteria is a stand-in for the inarticulable misery of the social inertness of post-menopausal life, as in O’Neill’s play Long Day’s Journey into Night. Scarification is a dramatic rejection of coercive standards of sexual attractiveness, as in Hawthorne’s short story The Birthmark. Female “sexual gate-keeping” has been pathologized as sexual frigidity and a radical lack of commitment to spouse and family (Auerbach 1986) (Angle 2010). The object of transphobia is, of course, the individual body of the transgender person. More specifically, however, it is the sexual body of the transgender person. Transphobia is fixated on the reproductive potential and abnormality of the transgender person’s body. It fixates on parsing “true” sex. The prioritizing of “true” sex as in the case of intersex and transgender people reflects the supreme interest of the state in reproductive potential and control. Rejection of this priority is blasphemy in the mandatory cult of capitalism. Transphobia is one reaction to the   fear of losing control of normative reproduction and family formation—the building blocks of a panoptic, self-policing society. Societies regularly reproduce and socialize the kind of bodies that they need in times of crisis (Talcott 2017). Because transgender bodies are not ‘the kind of body’ this society needs, they are uniquely subject to the disciplinary action of the hospital. Furthermore, the social body ensures that transgender bodies are not always wanted by transgender people themselves, via internalized transphobia. Transphobia is a biopolitical strategy of reproductive control As argued above, the individual body has somatic potential to resist the interests of its oppressors. The individual body responds to the machinations of the body politic mutely in the language of the body, the “language of the organs” (Scheper-Hughs and Lock 1987). These biological utterances are not without responses from the body politic of course; the reinforcement of biopolitical control often stems from the pathologization of these bodily replies to social violence. In the case of transgender individuals, this back and forth settles squarely on sexuality, gender, and reproduction by which the state regulates not only the transgender individual but the transgender population. This sexual policing is enforced by the body politic, deployed by transphobia, and processed via transgender minority stress. The institution of biopolitics is the instrument through which the state produces that bodies it needs. Biopower, as conceptualized as Michel Foucault, is the disciplinary control of human reproduction, living, and dying (Foucault 2008). It characteristically entails a relation between ‘letting die’ and ‘making live’—that is to say strategies for the governing of life (Rabinow and Rose 2006). It mediates entrance intro life by standardization of birthing and labor strategies. It suspends permission to die via a coercive gauntlet of physically and financially brutal, life-saving interventions (Matzner 2017). These births and deaths are observed and recorded in the panoptic supervision of the hospital. The clinic is the primary site in which the transgender body is conceptualized, and this is no accident. Corporatized medicine enjoys a tenuous alliance with the state via it gains power, not only of health and care, but of life itself (Agamben 2011). The deployment of biopower is distinct from eugenics in that its primary goal is not to domesticate a docile, homogenous population via centralized action on reproduction. Rather, it is endlessly refracted, enforcing the state’s reproductive and medical mores such that the population is coerced to create this domesticated population seemingly of its own volition, via internalized gender and sexual policing.  There are certain stressors that the body politic cannot handle—a diminishing majority coupled with a growing heterogeneous minority population chief among them. Thus, the social body internalizes and enforces the eugenic agenda of the body politic. This agenda is then enforced upon individual bodies along a steep social gradient. That is, people with means can reproduce while avoiding the typical time, labor, and health investments with disadvantaged taking up the load. For example, national “others” of poverty are adopted into privileged homes as citizens, thus turning a profit on a previously inaccessible resource via the disposable income of the rich. For example, parents of means may avoid the lifetime earnings price of (1) flattening their career trajectory, (2) taking unpaid leave, (3) pregnancy discrimination via access to childcare and extended parental leave. For example, parents can avoid the burden of pregnancy itself via paid surrogacy—thus coercively imposing the wealthy’s reproductive burden and physical risk of pregnancy on the poor. It therefore disproportionately acts to transmute the disorderly poor and the socially deviant into malleable capitalist assets. In sum, not only is privilege protective against the capitalist eugenic   agenda—disadvantage actively amplifies vulnerability to it. Refusing medical transition to children because of fear of losing their reproductive labor and contribution. American biomedicine as we know it goes hand-in-hand with American capitalism, which determines the value of a person by their potential to support and further the market. Thus, citizens unable or unwilling to contribute their children to the workforce are abnormal and unwanted—punished and forcibly normalized. For transgender people, this punishment and normalization is most evident in conversion therapy, religious healing interventions, and unnecessary fertility preservation procedures. Less evident is the fear of non-passing transgender people; that is, if a transgender can appropriately “normalize” their body by either (1) choosing not to physically transition, or (2) physically transitioning in such a way that normative gender expectations are met. An ambiguous middle state is unacceptable. That is, a transwoman who passes is more valued than a transwoman who does not. The existence of noticeably transgender people upsets expectations about sexuality, power, and fertility; thus, these people are pushed aside and transmuted into curiosities and jokes. That is, the social body goes far out of its way to reiterate its lack of attraction to and regard for non-passing transgender people. A transgender woman is less socially threatening if she is transformed into a silly man in a dress. That way, she can be laughed at instead of feared. When she ceases to be funny—when she becomes a threat to the sexual dimension of the body politic—she is physically subject to transphobia. She is harassed, assaulted, raped, and killed. Passing transgender people have, at least, domesticated their bodies to reproduce the values of the social body and sexually satisfy the body politic. These bodies can become invisible and inoffensive—until they aren’t. The response of the domesticated body of the body politic can be visceral and violent. An outed transgender person might experience the fearful lashing out of the body politic’s “transgender panic”. That is, a person who commits a violent crime against a transgender person is permitted to assert the trans panic defense, which claims the defendant found the revelation of the transgender person’s identity so frightening and offensive that they experienced a state of violent, temporary insanity. When a heterosexual man is charged with murdering a transgender woman with whom he has been sexually intimate, one defense strategy is to assert what has been called the trans panic defense. The defendant claiming this defense will say that the discovery that the victim was biologically male provoked him into a heat of passion causing him to lose self-control. If the jury finds that the defendant was actually and reasonably provoked, it can acquit him of murder and find him guilty of the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter. (Lee 2020) Just as individuals act in state of “queer panic” so too does biomedicine. As the terrified heterosexual reacts violently to the “duplicitous” transgender person, so too does biomedicine react violently to interruptions of normative sex. Individual cultures provide disciplinary codes and scripts itemizing the domestication of the individual body into the docile body the body politic calls for (Foucault 2008). A plain example of this domestication is the use of “corrective” genital surgeries on non-consenting children. Aside from emergency, lifesaving surgeries, healthcare providers take great pains to get informed consent from people undergoing surgery. Even for life saving surgeries, physicians usually make every effort to postpone them to a point that the patient is likely strong enough to tolerate the procedure. But for intersex babies, biomedicine has historically intervened with “corrective” surgeries long before the child can understand, much less   consent to the procedures.  These surgeries are neither lifesaving, nor medically necessary. They’re cosmetic procedures to maximize the appearance of typical female or male anatomy—frequently at the expense of fertility, erotic sensation, continence, and hormonal health (Creighton 2001). It’s not uncommon for the child’s surgical history and intersexuality to be hidden from them. Meaning, people often learn about their intersexuality as adults—sometimes after struggling to have children, sometimes after reflecting on unusually frequent doctors’ visits in their childhood, sometimes after investigating unexplained genital scarring. Aside from the obvious ethical quagmire that is forgoing informed consent, these surgeries (sometimes referred to as Intersex Genital Mutilation or IGM) are essentially experimental. Meaning, there are no standards of care to encourage any kind of methodological or ethical constants. A particularly shocking example of the experimental nature of “corrective” intersex genital surgery is outlined in a 2007 Journal of Urology article entitled, Nerve sparing ventral clitoroplasty: Analysis of clitoral sensitivity and viability. The authors present data from their follow-up examinations of <6 year old girls who had undergone “nerve sparing ventral clitoroplasty” (“normalization” of clitoromegaly) performed by Dr. Poppas. The data aims to prove that Poppas’ method of surgically reducing the clitoris is both cosmetically and responsively superior to alternatives. Dr. Poppas and his associates tested blood perfusion by pressing a fingernail into the children’s clitorises and measured the sensitivity of the children’s clitorises with a vibrator (Yang 2007). There is no therapeutic or medical benefit for the patients in this examination. The patients were molested to prove that a surgery they underwent without consent worked. The article was a ‘clinical prize finalist’ in the Journal of Urology.  Put simply, ours is a society frightened of children. What if our children are unwilling to provide anatamopolitical links to reproduce the body politic? Ours is a society that fears infertility. Transgender people represent possible heterosexual couplings without the potential of children. Transgender people additionally represent the possibility of queer couplings with the potential of children. Both options offend. Reproduction uncontrolled by the traditional family unit is a profound threat to social control. Thus when transgender children and young adults seek gender affirming medical care, the social body intervenes to procure the kind of body the state needs. Therefore, transgender children are often denied care until they reach adulthood, pressured to take fertility-preserving measures (harvesting eggs, collecting sperm), or enrolled in gender conversion therapy. This polar reaction reflects the deep, age mediated ambivalence toward transgender individuals’ status. That is, youth are convinced not to be transgender, and transgender adults are exterminated. The middle ground seems to fall in young adulthood wherein the academy acts in a pseudo-protective capacity. However, the question remains: why is the loss of the transgender person’s fertility and sexuality so threatening? After all, transgender individuals represent only 0.3-0.5% of the US population. We are afraid of children, but we are afraid of a world without children. We are arguably most afraid of a world with many, powerful children. A lack of children means a lack of a transmissible medium for power. Many, powerful children means being outnumbered and overpowered. Children are best when they are numerous, but docile—seen, not heard. Reproductive control is pivotal because it is sexuality—and children—that links an ‘anatamopolitics’ of the individual body to a ‘biopolitics’ of the body politic. Even in societies with no lack of contraceptive resources and public sexual education, sexual control still hints at a sublimated need to control the production of potentially dangerous, uncontrollable, or otherwise un-tameable individual bodies. The most proximal power a   person has arises from their own body. Sexuality is a particularly transformative bodily power.  The power of transgender children raises fear of loss of sexual distinctiveness, the creation of a genderless world, and the subsequent loss of control of fertility resulting in a heterogeneous, difficult to control population. Notably, transgender individuals do not embody or advocate for this kind of world; on the contrary, transgender individuals actively desire membership and power over the social function of gender. This desire for membership and power, of course, raises the possibility of radical change, but a gender apocalypse seems unlikely.  The body politic is inherently conservative, while sexuality tends toward generative. Children, especially transgender children, must be kept from their gender, their sex, their sexuality, their pleasure, and their power until they have successfully internalized the values and interests of the body politic. In a world with powerful child agents aplenty, who control their own fertility and gender expression, the normalizing structures of sex and gender weaken. Therefore, knowledge of gender, sex, and sexuality is protected and portioned out piecemeal, according to the propriety of the social body. Knowledge of pleasure and power is not portioned at all. It is limited to surreptitious, affective learning. Once accrued, this knowledge is a social liability; that is, to reveal one’s knowledge is to open oneself to punishment. Even though a transgender child’s self-knowledge is not qualitatively different than a cisgender child’s self-knowledge, it is actively punished. It is the same knowledge, brought into sharp definition by contrast. Children’s insight into their genders, sexes, and sexualities does not hang in suspended animation until sixth grade biology. Their insight is, however, actively silenced and punished until then. For cisgender children, the punishment for sexual/gendered declarations is for the most part an adequate deterrent. For transgender children, this punishment must be weighed against deep ontological alarm. Transgender children have the greatest stake in asserting and defending a gender identity early in life—because submitting to the default is existentially dangerous.  As a result, transgender children tend to be more vocal about their gender, sex, and sexuality than cisgender children are. This imbalance leads to the perception that transgender children are damaged by sexual perversion, because the mandatory sexual silence of cisgender children is read as the norm, while it is, in fact, also disordered. Therefore, the already subversive claim of a transgender identity is further delegitimized by the assumption of pathological perversion. Gender expansive children are then subject to disproportionate sexual and moral punishment. Some of this repressive instinct is expressed in the disproportionate presence of queer children in the mental healthcare system. That is, selection bias for queer children and the proliferation of disease categories describing sexual disturbance has created a “sick and deviant majority” of transgender children (Scheper-Hughs and Lock 1987). Therefore, the transgender child’s lack interest in fertility and lack of submission to gender hegemony needs to be conformed and pathologized—subtly of course—by the diagnostic gatekeeper, gender dysphoria (GD). That is, in order to legitimize their true gender, transgender people must become part of a diagnostic group of people with gender dysphoria—a group that didn’t exist before. Meaning, biomedicine had to “make up” some group of invalids to contain and pathologically define transgender people (Hacking 2006). In other words, transgender people weren’t sick until they needed to be. Once it became clear that the path of least resistance toward surveying and controlling the sexuality and fertility of transgender people was on the back of the medical discipline’s nominal biopower, they became: in the DSM-III, people with “transsexualism”, in the DSM-IV people with “gender identity disorder”, and in the DSM-5,   people with “gender dysphoria” (American Psychiatric Association 2020). This diagnostic gatekeeping interferes with identity synthesis because it forces the assumption of a “sick” identity to access physical transition. That is, it is difficult to assume the transgender identity into the whole without declaring an essentially sick personhood. Regardless of personal resistance to the othering of trans-ness, this is the uncompromising price of admission. Meaning, a transgender individual is on some level forced either to split their identity or to internalize illness where there is none. Aside from the obvious harm to self-concept this identity crisis represents, confounded identity synthesis leaves the transgender identity itself vulnerable; viz. if the minority identity is not “protected” by the totality of the individual’s complex and personal identities, it—and the individual—is more open to the harmful effects of transphobia (Eliason 1999).  In coming out models, integration of the minority identity with the person’s other identities is seen as the optimal stage related to self-acceptance (Cass 1979). Though models like this ignore the complexity of regression due to external circumstances, it is worth noting that being actively prevented from reaching this theoretical, optimal stage is deeply concerning. These external circumstances may include events characterized by distressing “identity interruptions”, which are defined as interactions during which feedback received from others is incompatible with an individual’s self-identity (Burke 1991). Although internalized transphobia is, like internalized LGB stigma, most devastating before and during the coming-out process, it is highly unlikely that internalized transphobia dissipates with active acceptance of one’s gender. One does not so easily shed the repercussions of their early social formation—and their own history of self-denial. Residual transphobic biases remain. It is rather like the cessation of being constantly dosed with poison as opposed to being given an antidote.  Transgender people are particularly vulnerable to identity interruptions, of which there are legion. The constant reality of being misgendered, misnamed, excluded, and rejected in both the most formal and informal of settings is poisonous. The constant danger of being outed, assaulted, murdered, and raped is traumatizing. The constant weight of defending one’s fundamental reality to allies and enemies alike is profoundly fatiguing. The fear of mounting an insufficient argumentative defense reflects the unfair burden on transgender people to defend not only their own legitimacy, but the rightful existence of their kindreds. These identity interruptions subvert and delegitimize the transgender individual’s basic self-concept. Furthermore, it is known that “the more a person identifies with, is committed to, or has highly developed self-schemas in a particular life domain, the greater the emotional impact of stressors in that domain” (Thoits 1999). That is, the prominence of an identity mediates the accompanying distress when that identity is brought into question. For transgender individuals, it is difficult to avoid the creation of an intimately and intensely personal of a self-schema regarding their gender. Meaning, the centrality of a transgender minority identity is difficult to avoid. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether de-emphasizing a minority identity, in the case of any minority self-schema, is an acceptable coping strategy. This is, this sort of strategy seems (1) to assume—and mandate—unreasonable agency of the individual, (2) to conceptually prioritize the interests of the oppressor over the individual, and finally (3) to demand possibly painful distancing from kindreds, thus decentralizing of minority power, community, and resilience.  Transgender individuals seeking medical transition are offered half-hearted attempts to preserve their fertility. However, when these interventions are accepted, the transgender person is regarded with open disgust, confusion and rejection as a reproductive agent on a total   level (Light 2014), especially within the medical field and the trans-exclusionary core the ‘gestational parent’ = ‘mother’ = ‘woman’ paradigm (MacDonald 2016). Transmasculine gestational parents are often read as violating the woman’s space of mothering; that is, transmasculine gestational parents are read as participating in the life event upon which the body politic rests its misogynist evaluation of women writ large. These fathers are, therefore, forced to re-endure pregnancy-related misogyny and to endure the suspicion and hostility of other parents—both from the desire to protect sanctity of a woman-exclusive space and from the desire to wave away the existence of a gestational father. On a structural level, there exist no standards of care regulating the medical care of a transgender father. On a social level, the father is a threat—an alien. Barriers to transgender participation in healthcare are mechanisms of biomedical sex policing Participation in the healthcare system involves unique, iatrogenic psychic, physical, and ontological harm to the transgender person. The medical documentation of sex dehumanizes the individual—and legitimatizes and essentializes an identity antithetical the transgender person’s lived experience and self-conception. Furthermore, it mandates provider participation in patient endangerment, sexually informed standards of care, and reinforcement of the sex binary at the direct expense of the patient.  Current electronic medical records allow patients to define a “preferred” name and pronouns in their charts. However this information is not widely disseminated or reflected in any further documentation (including scripts, which open the transgender patient to further outing in public settings in which the transgender cannot predict the reaction of techs, pharmacists, and other customers); furthermore, chosen names and pronouns are only displayed once a patient’s chart is opened by the primary provider—meaning, nurses and CNAs tasked with taking the patient’s initial vitals must call a patient’s legal name publically in both in and outpatient settings. This places the transgender person in a unfamiliar public space in which they cannot anticipate potentially dangerous reactions to their identity. All forward facing identifiers (for example, hospital wristbands, room names, and care team notes) list the patient’s legal name, effectively outing the patient to all persons—including parties irrelevant to the transgender person’s care like other patients and their visitors – often leaving the healthcare team unaware of the patient’s transgender status, and effectively leaving the patient at the mercy of an entire floor’s knowledge of and attitudes towards transgender people. Even providers who are actively allied with transgender people cannot make changes to forward facing identification produced by electronic records. Beyond the obvious adverse psychological outcomes associated with these healthcare experiences, transgender patients are vulnerable to harassment and direct violence from all witnesses. Additionally, these dangers discourage future involvement in the healthcare system, leading to poorer physical and mental health outcomes. Transgender suicide is a thanatopolitics of the state Transphobia is a construct of biopower. Its extreme manifestation is a ‘thanatopolitics’, a politics of death. If one accepts the proposition that poor transgender health outcomes are not merely permitted but contrived, then the disproportionate suicide rate in transgender individuals must be by design as well. Meaning, suicide is enacted by the individual body, enforced by the social body, and designed by the body politic. That is, suicidality in transgender populations reflects systematic yet indirect murder of transgender persons. If transgender youths are frequently “driven to suicide” (Austin 2020), someone is behind the wheel.    To systematically analyze the channels through which suicide is encouraged, a clear concept of suicidality is necessary5. To most appropriately evaluate the social dimension of suicidality, the inter-personal theory of suicide (IPTS) is used. IPTS models the capacity to attempt suicide thusly: (1) thwarted belongingness, (2) perceived burdensomeness, (3) capacity to kill oneself (Joiner 2005) (Van Orden 2012). These three factors are theoretically linked with internal minority stressors, which are based on feelings of social rejection, shame, isolation, and discrimination (Testa 2016). Thwarted belongingness comes from a lack of social connection and reciprocal support associated with loneliness, feelings of rejection, social withdrawal, childhood abuse, and family conflict (Testa 2016). The channels through which transgender people are excluded from genuine social inclusion are legion—though some are more obvious than others. Most notably, transgender people are frequently excluded from the labor market, from civic participation, and from housing. Perceived burdensomeness comes includes self-hatred and feeling like a liability/burden to others. It is associated with homelessness, unemployment, feeling unwanted, low self-esteem, self-blame, and shame (Testa 2016). Capacity to kill oneself is accrued through enhanced pain tolerance with the prerequisite of physical capability to enact the suicide (Joiner 2005). That is, an individual must be able to tolerate pain without seeking relief. Transgender individuals are exposed to excess physical and psychic violence, thus enhancing pain tolerance via external discrimination. Internally, transgender individuals have a higher prevalence of self-harm than the general population (Liu 2012). Self-harm is a known avenue for enhanced pain tolerance and suicide attempts (Van Orden 2010).                                                            5 See figure 2 for an illustration of the external and internal processes of transphobia mediated suicidality Employment discrimination against detectably transgender persons is endemic (McFadden 2019) (Borm and Baert 2017) (Bradford et al 2013) (DeSouza 2017). The downstream effects of unemployment on morbidity and mortality are well characterized, and it is further known that these effects are largely mediated by of social welfare access (Bambra and Eikemo 2008). Furthermore, access and utilization of social welfare in transgender populations is disproportionately low, thus exacerbating transgender vulnerability to excessive morbidity and mortality stemming from underemployment (Rosentel et al 2019). Exclusion from the labor force and the resultant health and earnings gap is a significant determinant of poor mental health outcomes in particular (Strandh et al 2014) (Allen et al 2014). Transgender populations, controlling for employment status, are known to experience greater prevalence of mental illness than the general population (Winter et al 2016). The synergy between these trends is devastating to general health and life expectancy (McDowell et al 2019). The coalescence of these three factors is not so much a convergence of minority stress symptoms as a triumvirate of transphobic priorities: (1) to exclude, (2) to devalue, (3) to exterminate. With regard to suicide, stress theorists have struggled to reconcile the seemingly incompatible ideas that transgender people can cope with minority stress and that the transgender person is a victim of overwhelmingly power biopolitical violence (Meyer 2003). For good reason, researchers want to avoid overemphasizing coping strategies and protective factors against minority stress, thereby laying undue pressure on the minority person to change—not the system itself. At the same time, there is resistance to thinking of transgender individuals as mere observers to their own victimhood because of the possibility of defeatism and conceptual theft of minority   agency. This tension, however, is moot if one considers the fact that it is the transphobia of the social body and the body politic that kills transgender people—not minority stress. That is, it is not the individual processing of discrimination that kills people; it is the discrimination. Meaning, it is not transgender minority stress or status that causes suicide; it is the discrimination. Conclusion Bodily absorption of noxious transphobic social discourse in not only permitted, but contrived. The mechanisms of transgender minority stress are intentionally deployed by the body politic, obscured by the social body, and contained by the individual body. The first step to pulling back the curtain on this obfuscation is identification by inference. These inferences must come in the form of mutually informed and problematized conceptual and statistical models both. Social scientists have made some headway in this effort, however these labors have been fundamentally disordered by the lack of a comprehensive model of transphobia itself. At this point, theorists must take the existence of transgender minority stress for granted and begin to do the work of sociohistorically, politically, and ideologically tracing the birth of state-level transphobia. The insidiously eugenic, malignantly capitalist, misogynist, and homophobic genesis of transphobia ought to be strangled in the cradle. That is, the sublimated eugenics program of American capitalism must itself be subject to its individual bodies’ power of letting live and making die.

Lauren Ristvet and Amy Hillier, who have supported me even when I dodged them after each conceptual pivot the paper took. There are a few members of the anthropology department who have profoundly influenced my thinking as an anthropologist and researcher. I am profoundly indebted to all of them. I am especially grateful to Dr. Puneet Sahota for teaching me to conduct policy research, to Dr. Michael Joiner for introducing me to the biopolitical, to Dr. Janet Monge for kindling my interest in the physical body, and to Dr. Mark Lycett for helping me surmount my fear of the quantitative. They have given me confidence that I have relied on heavily over the past few years. Outside of the anthropology department, I am grateful to Dr. Scott Weinstein for unwittingly preparing me to learn coding, to Dr. Dorothy Roberts for giving me a vocabulary to problematize my social world, to Dr. Lisa Miracchi for giving me the foundation to philosophically examine the ‘mindful body’, to Allauren Forbes for helping me connect the political to the ethical and epistemological, and to Dr. Deborah Burnham for helping me apply my humanities streak to my social science studies. None of these teachers of mine know that they have guided me through this thesis. I owe a thank you to my professors at Hofstra University as well. I want to thank Dr. Anthony Dardis who taught me how to think. I am indebted to Dr. Lauren Kozol who nurtured my voice as an academic. I am grateful to Dr. Stephen Smith who made my love of humanities feel worthy. I am grateful to Dr. Cynthia Bogard who introduced me to critical class theory. Their kindness taught me pride and humility both, and I am struck, as I write, by my debt to them. I am thankful to my friends and family for their unwavering love and warmth. They have had to support me more than any of us ever imagined, I think. My parents Jane and John Cinicola, my siblings Alora and Jack, my cousins, Alex and Christopher Davis, have kept me on my feet. My friends Francesca Corna, Amy Buck, Quinn Willer, Urvi Banerjee, Colton Davis, Shelby Wheeler, Grace Daigle, Katie Walter, Erin Brown, Silpa Kosouri, Jack Beltz, Christian Aleman, and Alex Forde have patiently buoyed me. Chavelo, the cat who adopted me, has brought unique joy to the final weeks of composition with his neediness and moral support.     Appendix: Statistical Tables  Table 1.

    "abstract": "Over reliance on existing LGB models of minority stress is uncomfortable proxy for the conceptualization of a model particular to transgender individuals. Furthermore, proposed transgender minority stress models thus far have lacked an accompanying concept of transphobia itself. I advance five processes of transgender minority stress, along with five corresponding processes of state-sanctioned transphobia based on existing literature, an original quantitative analysis, and an original sociohistorical review of the birth of state-level transphobia. Minority stress is comprised of (a) discriminatory events and conditions (b) vigilance, (c) internalized stigma, (d) concealment and (e) delegitimization. Transphobia operates on state-level processes of (a) a sublimated eugenics program, (b) the breeding and domestication of a docile, homogenous population, (c) capitalist labor force management, (d) the policing of normative sex and reproduction, and (e) maintenance of the medical power of disenfranchisement. These state-level processes reflect the insidiously eugenic, malignantly capitalist, misogynist, and homophobic priorities of the body politic. These priorities are deployed on a social level via systematic exclusion from employment, housing, civic participation, healthcare access, and social welfare",
