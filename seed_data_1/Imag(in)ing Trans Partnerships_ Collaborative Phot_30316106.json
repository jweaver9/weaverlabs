    "abstract": "In this peer reviewed journal article, Davidmann argues that collaborative photography offers dynamic potential for imag(in)ing trans* intimate partnerships beyond the authority of textual representation. Davidmann presents five photographic and narrative case studies, spanning a range of trans* partnerships in the UK, to demonstrate some of the complex ways in which bodies, genders, sexualities, and time intersect in trans* intimacy. She argues that the photographs create an imaginative resource, both for the people depicted in the photographs and for those viewing the photographs, providing new possibilities for thinking about trans* partnerships, expanding the ways in which trans intimate partnerships are imag(in)ed, and opening up new spaces of possibility for gender and sexual identities",
