    "abstract": "Contrary to popular belief, singular they has a long history of use in the English language. Feminist progress enabled its return in the 20th century after prescriptivist efforts to suppress it, and the modern-day gender diversity movement continues to expand its use in innovative ways. Current use is categorized in five ways: nonsolid, indefinite, specific, queer, and universal. Given its historicalconnection with social movements, quantitative and large-scale investigation of its current and past sociolinguistic distribution is an exciting research direction with the potential to accurately describe a complex example of language change. To this end, a computational approach is elaborated for which the use of the novel GPT-3 seems best suited. Through a series of experiments that explore the different capabilities of GPT-3, an ideal pipeline from data collection and annotation to fine-tuning is developed. Furthermore, the research shows that GPT-3 is a powerful and versatile tool that will advance linguistic research also outside of this specific area",
