The author reflects on ordinary moments where sexualityand relationships become meaningful and situate emotions at the heart of analyticalenquiry because it is through emotional interactions that micro–macro networks ofrelations intersect. Autobiography is combined with original data from empiricalresearch to provide analytical entry points, which aims to advance understanding andalso facilitate reflection on how we understand and come to know queer parenthood.Whilst there are now many routes into lesbian motherhood and the stigma of queerkinship is diminishing, this article demonstrates the need to problematize the prevailingnarratives of coupledom that are emerging and tease apart the conflation of temporalprogression, progressive rights and narratives of progress.Keywordsautoethnography, coupledom, emotions, lesbian motherhood, queer familiesIntroductionThe international lesbian and gay association (ILGA, 2015) has identiﬁed the UKas the most progressive country in Europe for LGBT rights. Over the past 25 yearsthere have indeed been rapid and predominantly positive socio-cultural and legalchanges. Social attitudinal data indicate growing tolerance of lesbian and gay rela-tionships (Duncan and Phillips, 2008); key legislative changes underpin and derivefrom these attitudinal shifts.

Lesbian and gay couples have accrued legal recognition throughcivil partnership legislation (2005) and same-sex marriage (2014). The impact ofthese changes on couples who want to celebrate and claim socio-legal status fortheir relationships remains signiﬁcant. Parenting possibilities can now feature in theimagined futures of LGBTQ relationships. In this context, this article looks back,to explore how the experience and rhetoric of same-sex parent families, and lesbianmotherhood in particular, have shifted over a generation. It examines how LGBTQrights and progressive shifts in legal and socio-cultural tolerance have impactedindividuals’ lives across the time period, on both an everyday level and with regardsto imagined parental–partnership trajectories. In so doing, it fastens everydayexperience to the materiality of socio-cultural changes, socio-economic class con-text and biographical circumstances. It also aims to demonstrate the value ofauthoethnographic observations and personal reﬂection, showing how these canidentify new and hitherto under-researched analytical entry points into existing setsof qualitative data.There is a wealth of research that has investigated queer parenthood and familycreation (see Berkowitz, 2009; Goldberg, 2010). Recent literature has explored‘families of choice’, focusing on elective ties that refashion understandings of kin-ship (Weeks et al., 1999; Weston, 1997). The practicalities and wherewithal ofjourneys into queer parenting have been interrogated (Tasker and Bigner, 2007),exploring the ways power and parenthood intersect (Gamson, 2015), through stor-ies of fostering and adoption (Goldberg, 2012; Hicks, 2011) and donor conception(Nordqvist and Smart, 2014), for example. Focusing attention on the impact ofheterosexist norms, legislation and familial ideologies, research has shown howqueer parenting is discursively conceptualized (Riggs, 2007; Thompson, 2002).Across these accounts, to a lesser or greater extent, diﬀerences and inequalitieswhich shape parental ‘choice’ have been examined, to shine a light on the changingnature of family in contemporary societies (Gamson, 2015). For example, centra-lizing race in accounts of lesbian motherhood demonstrates how diﬀerences cutthrough this sexuality-deﬁned cohort (Moore, 2011); similarly with class and edu-cation (Taylor, 2009). Stories of diﬀerent relationship and family forms have shownhow everyday acts and strategies of resistance may combine to queer lesbianmotherhood (Park, 2013).This article is indebted to and grounded in this rich body of knowledge, but itdoes not aim to review literature (for an overview 1970–2000, see Clarke, 2005).Like some of the authors cited above (Gamson, 2015; Riggs, 2007; Weston, 1998),the substantive argument advanced draws on a range of sources, including inter-view data from original empirical studies1 and autoethnographic ‘moments’ (Gabband Fink, 2015b). I use autoethnography to re-situate emotions at the conceptual,methodological and analytical heart of relationship studies. Aﬀect is a core part ofpolitical grammar; it is ‘key to reading the relationship between the epistemologicaland the ontological’ (Hemmings, 2011: 25). In my analysis, therefore, I focus on theemotionality of experiences because, through this, the patterning of relationshipsemerges, bringing to light how we relate to and engage with others and the social2 Sexualities 0(0)world around us (Burkitt, 2014: 8). My experience as a lesbian mother situates mein the psycho-social ﬁeld of enquiry. Personal extracts that are included here derivefrom research ﬁeld notes produced over the past 20 years, and recollection that isenriched through contemporary conversations and shared storytelling with familyand friends. These personal moments have served to trigger moments of reﬂectionon and critical re-engagement with empirical data generated over this time period.When participant extracts are presented, the research origin of these data is pro-vided in endnotes; this temporal location of data aims to open up generationalreadings of same-sex parenthood. Where further demographic information helps toadvance the analytical point, this is included in the body of the text.Writing lesbian motherhood: My own and others’ livesThis article, then, aims to provoke reﬂection from the situated vantage point oflives lived – my own and others. Sociological perspectives on intimacy and rela-tional life are illuminating and varied (see Gabb, 2008), but I agree with queercultural theorist Lauren Berlant who suggests that it is a timely point to rethinkintimacy and how we come to know intimate lives (Berlant, 1998). My decision tocombine life writing and empirical investigation keeps experience attached to thevisceral – heartfelt – embodiments of those represented. As Berlant says, life writ-ing can be ‘a primary laboratory for theorizing ‘‘the event’’ . . . [intimate publics] arelaboratories for imagining and cobbling together alternative construals about howlife has appeared and how legitimately it could be better shaped not merely in smallmodiﬁcations of normativity’ (Berlant and Prosser, 2011: 181–182). These intimatepublic laboratories are dynamic and diversely populated; they facilitate polyvocalstorytelling (Plummer, 2003) that resists the analytical compulsion to advance aunitary narrative.This resonates with the feminist thinking of Laurel Richardson who suggeststhat bringing together diﬀerent modes of expressions can be both creative andadvance insight. In stitching together this multi-layered textual tapestry, methodbecomes inquiry: ‘a way of ‘‘knowing’’ – a method of discovery and analysis. Bywriting in diﬀerent ways, we discover new aspects of our topic and our relationshipto it’ (Richardson, 2000: 923). This invites us to think not just about what we write,but how we write and where we write from. Our authorial position remains on thepage and writing through this situated position places us in dynamic relation to theothers whose stories we recount; a creative analytic practice (CAP) which simul-taneously evokes, represents and deconstructs meaning (Richardson and St Pierre,2005: 974). My use of everyday moments in lesbian motherhood – both my ownand others – is crafted in this vein. It focuses the analytical lens in this way becauseeveryday moments are where people feel the immediacy of their intimate connec-tions, and it in these emotional scenarios where micro and macro networks ofrelations intersect and overlap (Burkitt, 2014: 20).Focusing attention on the everyday renders the experience of marginalizedgroups as epistemologically valid (Craven and Davis, 2013: 27). Everyday momentsGabb 3shift attention away from ephiphanal or ‘fateful’ events (Giddens, 1991) onto‘small’ ordinary interactions that are personally signiﬁcant and which illuminateunderstandings of meaning-making (Gabb and Fink, 2015b). These moments pro-vide analytical entry points. In the absence of immediate and recognizable culturalvalue, we are required to double take; to think again, perhaps from a new point ofdeparture. As such moments are a means of undoing more than revelation(Baraitser, 2009), from this vantage point theoretical understandings can be builtfrom the bottom up.Me and mine: On 29th December 1990 I gave birth to Liam; a baby who was longedfor and cherished from the outset by me, a lesbian lone-parent. Over these past 25years, my adult relationships have gone through several iterations: the constancy is meand Liam. The mother–child ‘bond’ remains fundamental. My love for Liam is unre-served, and while I’m not certain what unconditional love means, I feel this is it.Liam’s birth thus represents a pivotal moment in my life story and he has animportant voice in this article. His birth is not, however, the only biological factorthat is important. Like many of my generation, I am adopted. I have no biologicalconnection to the man and woman who raised me, cared for me, loved me uncon-ditionally: my mum and my dad, both now sadly deceased. My inside–outsidestatus within the ﬁeld of queer kinship studies therefore starts from multiply-situ-ated positions on the cultural margins. This heritage shapes me: it informs myunderstanding of family and how I approach the academic ﬁeld of study. I bothdecentre biological narratives and embody them. From this situated outside-inposition, the familiar is rendered strange. I remain confounded by the culturalfascination with blood ties and genetic lineage: I simply don’t get it. However, asa birth mother, when parents talk to me of the intensity of their love for theirchildren, I understand: I empathize.Western socio-cultural meanings of biology stubbornly shape kinship ideolo-gies; the ﬂoating signiﬁer of birth and death. Genealogical links are renderedimmutable and as such their permanence bestows authenticity on the socialfabric of the heteronormative reproductive order (Weston, 1998: 77–79).Queer kinship has to some extent joined this genomaniac throng. The queer poten-tialities of assisted reproductive technologies have, I contest, been invoked to(paradoxically) consolidate the value of ‘blood, genes, inheritance, descent, andreproductive biology’ (Franklin, 2013: 285). How parenthood is contemporarilycreated and crafted has refocused attention onto conception as the inauguration ofparenthood. In analysis of adoptive parenthood and families of choice, it typicallysigniﬁes the benchmark against which such queer kinship is (favourably) measured(Thompson, 2002). Genealogy remains, therefore, overridingly formative and sym-bolically signiﬁcant – even when it is absent from the familial equation.Throughout this article, I seek to probe the origins and meanings of this biogeneticcertainty.4 Sexualities 0(0)Early conceptions of same-sex parenthood (1980s–1990s)A devastating characteristic of lesbian motherhood during this early period was theprevalence of divorce narratives and ill-fated custody disputes (Hanscombe andForster, 1981). At its worst, around 90 percent of lesbians in the UK were losingtheir children in contested custody cases during this time (Rights of WomenLesbian Custody Group, 1986). Heteronormative rhetoric and accompanyingduress to ‘do the right thing’ placed the child’s interest in contradistinction tothe mother’s own (selﬁsh) sexuality. Recounting her experience of lesbian mother-hood during this time, Vicky described unimaginably ‘tough decisions’ that werefoisted upon her.Vicky:2 It was very diﬃcult. I wanted to take them with me but I didn’t have anywhereto take them to. I knew that there was absolutely no way I could provide the kind oflifestyle that the father could . . . I knew absolutely nothing about being a lesbian,about anything that was available for any help. I didn’t even know anybody elseI could talk to about it. And my partner convinced me that if we took them theywould be tormented at school and taunted about it and all sorts of things like that.And my husband begged me not to take them. And the other thing was, I couldn’t facegoing into a court and ﬁghting for them and being told that I was a bad mother. So inthe end all of those things made me decide to leave them with their dad . . . it was verydiﬃcult.The emotional pain in Vicky’s interview was palpable and tears freely ﬂowed.She recalls how she didn’t get to tuck her children into bed and read them bedtimestories or be there to comfort them when they cried. Her ‘choices’ are all tooreminiscent of those imposed upon my birth mother, some 20 years previously.Only when socio-cultural and legal contexts moved on did Vicky get a chance toparent, re-becoming a ‘hands-on mum’ when her eldest child moved in to live withher in the late 1980s. This distressing account of childless motherhood is not simplyincluded here to illustrate the precarity of queer mothers’ position at this time; I useit to also draw attention to factors – beyond sexuality – that diﬀerentiate theexperience of lesbian motherhood. For women like Vicky, the ‘options’ availablewere overwhelmingly punitive and restrictive because of the potent intersections ofsexuality and class. Indeed, the resilience of such factors arguably continue toshape the experience of LGBTQ parenthood (Taylor, 2009) as I discuss later on.However, before I move on to these boundaries of possibility, I want to acknow-ledge some of the community contexts that have been arguably pushed aside in thequeer narration of contemporary kinship.Whilst there is now a rich body of work that richly represents the ﬁelds of studyon queer maternity and same-sex parent–families, in the 1980s and early 90slesbian separatist rhetoric remained in circulation. Here, lesbian mothers weresometimes characterized as collaborators with the patriarchal order (Robson,1994) and the derogatory term ‘breeder’ was common currency. Eﬀorts to realizeGabb 5a diﬀerent type of childrearing were seen as futile (see Polikoﬀ, 1987). ‘No matterwhat you do, if you have a boy, he will terrorize and attack girls and later, adultwomen, and statistically will very likely be a rapist’ (Jo, 1991: 315–317). Lesbianmothers with sons were regularly denied access to women’s events – such as ‘lezziecamp’ and ‘dykes on hikes’ – on the basis of family composition. To be clear, suchsentiments and separatism represented a minority opinion; being a lesbian motherduring this time was, nevertheless, grounded in and to some extent discursivelyshaped by such stigmatizing rhetoric which posed motherhood and sexuality asunnatural and politically undesirable bedfellows.Men and boys: Full of optimism, I move to a new area that is renowned for beinglesbian-friendly. A party invitation arrives on the doorstep; I await the date with highexpectations.A couple of drinks consumed and conversations on parenthood emerge. I readilyjoin in:Me: ‘Yes, my little one loves doing that too.’‘You have a child?’‘Liam; he’s at home.’‘You’ve got a boy; bad luck. Did you not douche with vinegar after inseminating? It’sa good way of getting rid of the male sperm.’I am dumbfounded – lost for words. I’m guessing I mumbled a reply; I cannot recall.Notwithstanding the implausibility of the advised course of action; the comment isstinging. I am misplaced and undone.This momentary encounter illustrates how lesbian mothers with sons encoun-tered separatist rhetoric of the time. Self-insemination was lauded as a means toassign feminist autonomy; positive action was required to ensure that the right(gendered) outcome proceeded. The birth of a boy signiﬁed failure in this regard,resituating mother and son together in the patriarchal order. Whilst contemporarynuanced understandings of sex, gender and parenthood suggest that such senti-ments should have been relegated to the dusty eons of yesteryear, they have notbeen entirely left behind. Only a few years ago, a woman recounted to me her‘family story’ in which she described her 30 minutes post-insemination headstand –reasoning that female sperm swim more slowly than male ones, so this wouldenhance their chances. Nine months later their son was born and both sheand her partner are now devoted mothers. Urban myths are hard to displace,and the desire for a child of one sex or the other has retained its stranglehold inthis cultural context and many others. The bifurcation of gender invoked here andseamless blurring of men and patriarchy belongs in many ways to a bygone era –albeit recent in terms of generational time. What remains are the structural factorsthat shape experiences of queer motherhood.6 Sexualities 0(0)The boundaries of possibilityThe impact of sexuality is still largely determined by personal contexts and biog-raphy, with what is imaginable and the realms of achievability being ﬁltered throughmultiple lenses. For those mothers with educational and cultural capital, for exam-ple, discriminatory Conservative policies that disavowed education on same-sexrelationships (notably Section 28)3 paradoxically aﬀorded personal and politicalopportunities. The groundswell revolt against such legislation enabled new territoryto be carved out through counter-discourses that celebrated alternative reproductiveand cultural narratives. These familial vistas were starkly diﬀerent to those of Vicky,engendering a story of lesbian motherhood as the vanguard of possibility.Penny:4 [Prime Minister] Thatcher introduced a residence order . . . to help grandpar-ents; but actually lesbian couples could use it. She was furious apparently . . .We werethe second lesbian couple to do that in the country . . .The ﬁrst with one child each;and we had to go through to the high court, which was ridiculous . . . So we were kindof trying to use the law right from the beginning to strengthen our card . . . It was verymuch a political thing for us.Charlotte: Pushing the boundaries.Penny: We felt like we were going to do it and we would be the ones because we werethe oldest of our cohort and all that kind of thing, and just because we could becausewe’re middle class and educated and we have a better chance than other peoplewould . . .Looking back at their journey into parenthood some 20 years previously, bothCharlotte and Penny openly acknowledge the privilege aﬀorded by their classstatus. It enabled them to own the debate, taking it on, challenging it: it wastheir time. Hiding lesbian motherhood in plain sight thus served to provoke andfacilitate a counter-discourse. In the ‘Stop the Clause’ furore that surroundedSection 28, lesbian motherhood in many ways found its voice, and even occupiedcentre stage. This dynamic period subsequently blossomed into the so-called ‘gaybyboom’. Self-help pregnancy manuals (such as Saﬀron, 1987) provided the informa-tion that women needed to create families, and keep them, and in so doing con-joined parental and partnership rights.As a woman in her 20s during this time, with badges on my lapels and placardsraised high, my personal journey into lesbian motherhood was ﬁlled with zeal andoverriding optimism.Pride in the park: A lovely afternoon chatting and laughing with friends old and new;maternal and sexual belonging coalesce. Liam, toddling around in his element, relishesthe attention of well-wishers who compliment his dancing and request pictures of this‘funky little chap’.Gabb 7I push the buggy across the park, a young man approaches:‘Do you think this is an appropriate place for a child?’This remark, deftly aimed, is designed to let me know that he is the responsible adult;I am the irresponsible parent.The recollection of this moment is shrouded in mixed emotions. As years passedI have rehearsed my retort to the comment many times: mounted my imaginaryrobust defence. I understand. In an era dominated by media hysteria around HIVand AIDS, this young man’s desire to protect hitherto discrete sexual spaces isunderstandable. Pretended families were carving out a cultural space, but geo-political territory remained contested. The need to be seen as ‘good mothers’ andprovide the best of familial circumstances (Dunne, 1998) meant that motherhoodand sexuality were also in many ways strategically kept apart. When Diva (1998)5ﬁrst devoted an issue to the topic of lesbian motherhood, it was tales of familialbliss and images of loving embraces that ﬁlled the pages. Wholesome togethernessemphasized the security of our domestic environments for children. Debates onS&M, body piercing and lesbian sex that peppered previous and subsequent issueswere absent. Lesbian parenthood was sanitized (Gabb, 2001).6 The commentnevertheless smarts and has a familiar sting: lesbian motherhood is misplaced.In the 1990s and 2000s, the power and ubiquity of heteronormative ideologyshaped the boundaries of what was imaginable and permissible in the realms ofqueer parenthood, making it hard to reconcile parental and sexual identities(Gabb, 2005b). For many, the weight of genealogical and familial ideologiesserved to contain possibilities.Claire:7 I have two diﬀerent relationships: one with [partner] and one with the boys.And when we’re all together it’s as natural and as calm and polite as possible, but it’sobviously not like a recreation of a family, and I wouldn’t try to do that tothem . . . [The boys] would have accepted it; but I know that they feel more comfort-able that this is their home. (emphases added)For Claire, what constitutes family is clearly informed by naturalizing discourses;however, her resistance to ‘recreating family’ also reﬂects an acknowledgement of thetemporal ties that bind. Claire’s desire to keep apart her family and partner wasmotivated in large part by her experience of the fragility of adult–sexual ties.After a series of heterosexual and then lesbian relationships, she accepted thatsuch adult aﬃnities could not be relied upon. It is children who provide the constantand reliable source of love in her life (Beck and Beck-Gersheim, 1995). To safeguardher children, she thus occupies the position of responsible adult: mother andchildren ﬁrst.Claire’s experience of lone motherhood is shared by many. Whilst recent trendsin the UK divorce rate indicate a decline, the number of divorces remains never-theless high (ONS, 2012). There has also been a 20 percent increase in CivilPartnership Dissolution since 2011, albeit this rise in ‘queer divorce’ is more a8 Sexualities 0(0)consequence of the initial numbers entering into civil partnerships than an upwardtrend in behaviour (ONS, 2013). The rate of relationship and ‘family breakdown’means that there are nearly 2 million lone parents living in the UK, and the year-on-year rise over the past decade is more than just statistically signiﬁcant. Loneparents with dependent children now represent 25 percent of all families andwomen account for 90 percent of all lone parents (ONS, 2015). The adverse impactsof associated poverty have been strongly linked to poor outcomes for children(Kiernan and Mensah, 2009) and thus lone parenting remains one of the mostpersistent factors in shaping experiences of motherhood (Duncan and Edwards,1999) – heterosexual and queer alike (Lewin, 1993). In the 1990s, the obdurateThatcherite rhetoric of ‘traditional family values’ exacerbated the social stigmaattached to the experience of single parenthood and, in the absence of a partner,this often overshadowed other points of sexual identiﬁcation (Gabb, 2005a):Zara:8 Being a single parent, being an unsupported parent, or limited support parent,that’s the hardest thing and I think that’s partly what I’ve been trying to think wellwhat is, what makes my life diﬀerent . . .For mothers like Zara, maternity was not experienced in the context of couple-dom and/or the kinship fold. The impact of this was both ﬁnancial hardship andpeer-isolation, with the combination of the two making her life feel hard and attimes isolating. Her maternity set her apart from the majority lesbian community.Her lesbianism disconnected her from the institutional spaces of heterosexualmotherhood. Her route into parenthood, via a former heterosexual relationship,positioned her outside ‘the vanguard’. Whilst not experienced as damaging, diﬀer-ence shaped Zara’s sense of self, something that was further exacerbated by havinga professional job and being an owner–occupier living on a predominantly rentedand socio-economically deprived housing estate.Creating families and family diversityRobust information on the numbers of children living in LGBTQ-parent house-holds is particularly hard to discern from national population datasets(Aspinall, 2009); establishing an accurate picture of the extent of family diversityis even harder. Sexual diversity did not feature in the Integrated Household Survey(IHS) until 2010, long after Section 28 (1988) and the 1990s ‘gayby boom’.It is, therefore, impossible to know with statistical conﬁdence how the stratiﬁcationof motherhood impacts on diﬀerentiated populations. What is clear, across timeand in diﬀerent socio-cultural contexts, is that the residual meanings of blood,genes and the reproductive narrative retain their purchase and combine with per-sistent rhetoric on the ‘best interests of the child’ and the ‘need for a father ﬁgure’in shaping the experience of lesbian maternity. This is perhaps one reason whychallenges to heteronormativity and familial ideology often come from the bottomup – out of the mouths of babes.Gabb 9The family twig: I arrive to pick up Liam (aged 10) from school.Teacher: ‘Can we have a word, I’m sorry; I’m worried Liam will be upset.’She goes on to describe the afternoon lesson where children were asked to draw theirfamily trees. Noticing that Liam is sitting quietly at his desk, not drawing, sheinquires:‘What’s the matter?’‘Nothing; I’ve ﬁnished.’‘But there are only two people on here.’‘That’s because there’s only me and my mum.’Neatly sidestepping the issue of fatherhood, she persevered:‘What about grandparents?’Liam explained that his nanny had recently died but she couldn’t be part of his familytree anyway because his mum was adopted and therefore there were no blood relativesapart from me and him. So, he reasoned:‘I drew a family twig.’The mortiﬁed teacher inquired whether there were other people who he thought of asfamily. He stated that there were of course many people who were his family, it’s justthat, by her instructions, they didn’t count – there were no blood connections.She suggested he included everyone he loved.Showing me his picture she likened it to woodland. All kith and kin were depictedincluding our three dogs, three goldﬁsh and numerous friends and ‘relatives’. Thefamily tree had blossomed.This moment in Liam’s childhood is fondly remembered by us both, albeitthe picture itself has been sadly lost amidst several house moves. His unfetteredacceptance of our respective embodied family circumstances and their material(in)signiﬁcance stops me short, still, and ﬁlls me with pride. Through thisschool exchange, the lesson had been learnt (by both pupil and teacher) andthe salience of cells and plasma and the cultural meanings aﬀorded to thesehad been unsettled.Today, in 2017, social and legislative changes mean that there are more routes toLGBTQ parenthood than ever before and progenitor ancestry is no longer taken-for-granted. Same-sex parenthood has shrugged oﬀ its novelty value and queer kindiversity reﬂects every hue of the family rainbow. Before the bunting is unfurled,however, and notwithstanding positive shifts in socio-cultural attitudes (Duncanand Phillips, 2008), it is important to remember that sex and relationships (SRE)education in England is yet to be compulsory, and the extent to which familydiversity is ‘taught’ in schools is thus patchy at best. Moreover, equality legislationand reproductive opportunities have perhaps simultaneously opened up and closeddoors on the intimate lives that are imaginable.In the UK, equal rights and bio-technological advances have served to reinforcethe couple dyad. Settling down, committing to a partner for the long term throughcivil partnership and/or same-sex marriage, and ‘starting a family’ are now routinepathways in a queer life trajectory. The academy remains deeply divided on the10 Sexualities 0(0)issue of same-sex marriage. For some, the rise in same-sex unions query/queertraditional institutions and represent a ‘profoundly symbolic rupture’ between mar-riage and heterosexuality (Weeks, 2007: 15). Socio-legal scholars oﬀer words ofcaution, suggesting that without wider recognition of sexual inequalities that prob-lematize the status quo, LGBT entitlements conversely instantiate heterosexualityrather than undo it (Rahman, 2000). For others, same-sex marriage representsassimilation (see Warner, 1993), transforming transgressive queer eros into dullrituals that reproduce ‘normative citizenship’ (Brandzel, 2005: 177). This is tooversimplify the debate and there are many areas of consensus. What is clearthough is that the ‘queer wars’ (Warner, 1999) around same-sex unions have over-written the ‘sex wars’ of yesteryear and in so doing have neatly deposited same-sexparenthood in the inner sanctum of the ‘charmed circle’ (Rubin, 1984).Coupledom and the reproductive imperativeEarly vestiges of radical potentiality that were present in blended bio-social‘families of choice’ are hard to recuperate when sex radical is pitched against bio-genetic imperatives. Whilst there is exciting contemporary research that queersgenealogy through socio-legal analysis of queer wills (Harries and De Las Casas,2013; Johnston and Longhurst, 2010), for example, my point here is that polarizeddebate has served to discursively obscure the diversity that is present in our livesand loves. Experience is trimmed to neatly ﬁt within a sexual cartography: in–out,this–-that, and nowhere in-between. Former radical potentialities of queer parent-hood are subsumed beneath the weight of heteronormative relational rights.Concepts of home and family belonging now frame LGBTQ experience morethan ever before (Weeks et al., 2001: 77–103), with the permanence of bricks andmortar embedding futurity into the very construct of queer households. Theintensiﬁcation of parenthood (Lee et al., 2014) is mobilized to cement this familialagenda, wherein the neoliberal adult couple relationship is based on parentingresponsibilities and ‘priorities are rooted in work, economic self-suﬃciency, edu-cation and good behaviour’ (Williams, 2004: 244).Recent research interviews completed with young queer couples revealed howtheir intimate ambitions now routinely include a commitment to growing up andsettling down. The underlying assumption here was parenthood is now somethingthat must be considered: whether, when and how to have children:Chloe:9 The initial outlay is what I think, because it’s going to cost a lot of money toget some sperm or to get a baby, isn’t it? Um, and it’s a lot of money, it’s a deposit ona house . . .Leanne: We have talked about getting a dog, but a dog is, like, a big commitment, likea child, really. The only diﬀerence is that you can’t take a dog on the plane.Chloe: Now you’re comparing dogs to children . . . [raising voice] it’s nothing likea child.Gabb 11Leanne: No, but I meant in terms of, like, they grow up, whereas a dog, it is alwaysdependent on you, isn’t it? It’s like having a child, a baby forever.In the banter between Chloe and Leanne, their commitment to the relationshipproject is consolidated through children, pets and home ownership. YoungLGBTQ people in 21st-century Britain have grown up in the milieu of same-sexmarriage. Potential parenthood is their right and most planned – at some point intime, in some shape or form – to exercise these legal rights. Whilst early writings on‘families we choose’ represented a counter-discourse with elective ties being cham-pioned as evidence of the cultural artiﬁce of genealogy (Weston, 1997), today thechild and parenthood stand as symbols of permanency that are invoked to instan-tiate personal commitment. The aﬀective and moral work that is required in ful-ﬁlment of our ’happiness duty’ directs us towards certain life choices and awayfrom others (Ahmed, 2010). Radicalism and dissent are replaced with the aﬀectiverewards and social responsibilities of parenthood, secured through the state sanc-tiﬁed intimate union of ‘the couple’.Genevieve:10 For a long time, we talked about whether we might adopt, and now we’rethinking more we might try and have one ourselves. Um, so yeah, I think it is some-thing that we both want, and because that’s, sort of, our shared plan for the future, wecan, sort of, I mean, hopefully if it happens, it might not, but if it does that’s how we,sort of, see things panning out in the future. So, obviously, that’s a massive commit-ment to each other, as well.Talking to young queers, it was clear that reproduction is now employed as a riteof passage into commitment; a metonym for duration that bestows futurity on therelationship (Preser, 2015). Future plans and ‘family planning’ have becomeenmeshed. Starting a family together facilitates entry into the symbolic realms ofauthentic reproductive citizenship where biological ties simultaneously solidify thepast, present and future of both parental and partner relationships.Over the past generation (1990–2015) in the UK, there have undoubtedlybeen signiﬁcant advancements in equality rights and social attitudinal changes,but in the wake of these gains ‘compulsory coupledom’ (Wilkinson, 2012) rendersall non-dyadic conﬁgurations transgressive. As Kath Weston (1997) asserts, wehave come a long way from the two mommies/two daddies models of lesbianand gay parenthood; however, on the UK statute books it is dyadic same-sex(partner and parental) unions that are being championed. In the ﬁrst 5 yearsof civil partnerships (December 2005–2010), over 46,000 same-sex partnershipshad been registered (ONS, 2011). Policy interests on families converge aroundchildren, parenthood and families (DfCSF, 2010). In political and popular dis-courses, ‘hard working families’ are the priority. Irrespective of sexual orienta-tion, dual-headed (read dual income) households are characterized as bestplaced to meet children’s emotional and practical needs. Government tax breaks12 Sexualities 0(0)(Richardson, 2015) for ‘married’ couples reward those who are willing to work attheir relationships.ConclusionsIn the new reproductive order, respectability and responsibility are embedded insexual citizenship rights (Richardson, 2004) in ways that may be ultimately and‘tragically self-defeating’ (Weeks, 2007: 131). One person’s gain is typically at theexpense of another. Over the past generation, family visibility has simultaneouslyerased the non-familial, the non-dyadic and the queer (Smith, 1992). The rise of the‘pink pound’ has further accentuated the gap between those with economicresources and those without. Whilst there have been clear advances across muchof Europe in terms of LGBTQ rights over the past 25 years, this article demon-strates why we should also be wary of conﬂating temporal progression and narra-tives of progress. Narratives of progress are premised on shared understandings: weare moving forward (Hemmings, 2011). The collective here is hailed and harnessedinto the progressive momentum that propels us onward and upwards. Whilst timemoves forward and many contemporary equality rights may be indeed progressive,we should not lose sight of who gets written in and who gets written out of the storyof LGBTQ parenthood that gets told. For those who experience their sexualitythrough ‘the scene’ and/or within vibrant queer communities it may be hard toperceive the isolation and lack of choices experienced by others outside these envir-ons – past and present (Gabb, 2005b); but socio-economic resources and culturalcapital remain as salient as ever, perhaps even more so in the current economicclimate of ‘austerity Britain’.Women’s journeys into lesbian motherhood are multiple, so too their subsequentexperience of parenthood, but these journeys remain grounded in the materiality ofcircumstances and result from diﬀerential degrees of choice and opportunity that areavailable and/or imaginable. The Adoption and Children Act (2002) does aﬀordlesbian and gay people the right to adopt (individually and as partners), and the UKis presently one of only 14 countries where such same-sex couple adoption is a legallyavailable option; however, for those who want to conceive a child, the resourcesrequired are not insigniﬁcant. Donor insemination (DI) costs £500–£1000 for sixcycles of treatment. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is available on the NHS but access tothis service is tied to strict eligibility criteria, such as previous DI attempts, age andgeneral health indicators (NHS, 2017). Private IVF is prohibitively expensive formost and can cost over £5000 per cycle of treatment. So whilst Britain may be one ofthe most progressive countries for LGBTQ rights (ILGA, 2015), reproductive pos-sibilities are not cost-neutral. For those without access to ﬁnancial resources, it alltoo often remains an either–or choice: homosexuality or parenthood, or unregulatedand potentially unsafe routes into parenthood (Nordqvist and Smart, 2014).The sexual stories that get told both represent and shape experience (Plummer,1995): narrations are constitutive. As such, in this article I have aimed to paintGabb 13a more complex picture of same-sex parenthood over the past generation. Toacknowledge and own the contexts that shape experience, including contestationsfrom outside and within the queer community. Being a lesbian mother has notalways been easy and it remains deeply stratiﬁed. Routes into parenthood areundoubtedly proliferating in contemporary UK society but these are culturallyembedded within the discourses and legal rights of the parental couple as thebasis of a family unit. This seemingly regressive narrative may not, however, beas normalizing as it may ﬁrst appear. My recent research11 has shown that couplerelationships are not uniform – or even necessarily dyadic; they are as diverse inform and practice as the individuals within them. Relationships are sustainedthrough dynamic networks of friends, relatives, partners, colleagues, children,pets – to name but a few (Gabb and Fink, 2015a). The diverse experience of couplesand queer families arguably has the capacity to be more progressive than anyadvance in reproductive technology or partnership legislation.In this article, then, I have explored how the experience of same-sex parentfamilies has shifted over a generation and, in so doing, have disrupted straightfor-ward associations between progressive narratives of LGBTQ rights and the every-day lives of lesbian mothers. Locating parental–partnership trajectories in themateriality of their socio-economic, biographical and temporal contexts hasdemonstrated some of the ways that queer parents and their children encounterthe normalizing discourses of family and the reproductive order. These encounterscannot shrug oﬀ the vestiges of economic disadvantage, social stigma, or the weightof cultural norms – and pressures are brought to bear from both outside (inheteronormative society) and inside (the LGBTQ community). It also demonstratesthe value of authoethnographic observations and personal reﬂection as a researchtools, using these analytical entry points to take a fresh look at qualitative data andfasten experience to the emotionality of relationships. This situates aﬀect at thecore of enquiry. It illustrates the analytical rewards of studying queer kinshipthrough the sociological lens of emotions because, by paying close attention toeveryday ‘emotional scenarios’, it is possible to see the ways in which micro andmacro networks of relations intersect and overlap (Burkitt, 2014: 20). Queer kin-ship research amply demonstrates how families come in many shapes and sizes; thisarticle has shown how we can provide a more nuanced account that reﬂects thisdiversity by focusing on the emotional investments that shape these families,internally and externally. In so doing, ‘pretended families’ are not written anew,instead a more circumspect narrative is advanced including the costs of progressiverelational and reproductive rights.Notes1. Imag(in)ing the Queer Lesbian Family (1995–1996) was a small-scale project thatwas completed during my postgraduate studies. It explored how we might conceptualizeand represent the sexual and the maternal in studies of lesbian motherhood.Perverting Motherhood? (1998–2002) explored experiences and meanings of sexualityin lesbian parent families. Semi-structured interviews were completed with lesbian14 Sexualities 0(0)parent families (n¼ 13) who lived in the Yorkshire region of the UK comprising ‘birthmothers’ (n¼ 11), ‘other mothers’ (n¼ 7) and children (n¼ 13). Socio-economic/classrange 50:50; parents were in full-time (n¼ 18) and part-time employment (n¼ 8) orreceived state benefits (n¼ 7). Few respondents held managerial positions at work.The sample was predominantly white/UK (n¼ 14).Behind Closed Doors (2005–2006) examined experiences and understandings of intim-acy and sexuality in families. A combination of different qualitative methods was usedcomprising diaries, emotion maps, observation, interviews, vignettes, photographs andfocus/group interviews to generate data with parents and children living in the north ofEngland. The sample included 10 families, heterosexual (n¼ 9) and same-sex (n¼ 1):comprising mothers (n¼ 9), fathers (n¼ 5) and children (n¼ 10) (ESRC RES-000-220854).Enduring Love? (2011–2013) explored how couples experience, understand and sus-tain their long-term relationships, with particular attention to the impact of gender,generation, sexuality and parenthood. This mixed methods study included an onlinesurvey (n¼ 5445) and qualitative multiple methods. The qualitative convenience samplecomprised 50 couples: women (n¼ 56) and men (n¼ 44) aged 18–65 years old; 50 percentwere parents and 70 percent had higher education qualifications and/or were in profes-sional employment. The sample was largely white/UK (n¼ 80); 30 percent were LGBQ;transsexual participants (n¼ 4) variously identified as LGBQ or heterosexual (ESRCRES-062-23-3056).2.

    "abstract": "This article explores how advancements in equality rights combine with attitudinal changes in UK society and LGBTQ communities to impact on the experience of lesbian mothers over a generation. The author reflects on ordinary moments where sexuality and relationships become meaningful and situate emotions at the heart of analytical enquiry because it is through emotional interactions that micro–macro networks of relations intersect. Autobiography is combined with original data from empirical research to provide analytical entry points, which aims to advance understanding and also facilitate reflection on how we understand and come to know queer parenthood. Whilst there are now many routes into lesbian motherhood and the stigma of queer kinship is diminishing, this article demonstrates the need to problematize the prevailing narratives of coupledom that are emerging and tease apart the conflation of temporal progression, progressive rights and narratives of progress",
