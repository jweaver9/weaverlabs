    "fullText": "The ‘Futures’ of Queer Children and theCommon School IdealKEVIN MCDONOUGHThis paper focuses on an especially urgent challenge to thelegitimacy of the common school ideal—a challenge that hashardly been addressed within contemporary debates withinliberal philosophy of education. The challenge arises fromclaims to accommodation by queer people and queercommunities—claims that are based on notions of queernessand queer identity that are seriously underrepresented withincontemporary liberal political and educational theory. Thepaper articulates a liberal view of personal autonomy that isconstituted by a conception of practical reasoning rooted inthick communal experiences. It is argued that common schoolsconcerned with equal concern for the autonomy of all childrenmust attend to the specific communal requirements needed todeveloping the autonomous practical reasoning of queerchildren—requirements for what is termed a sense of‘futurity’. Five practical recommendations for commonschools are briefly outlined. The paper concludes with somereflections on the divergent and convergent interests of queertheory and liberalism, and considers some possibilities for apartial reconciliation of the two theoretical perspectives.At the most basic level, a ‘common school’ can be regarded as a schoolwhich is open to, and intended for, all students within a given societyregardless of their specific differentiating characteristics (TerenceMcLaughlin, 2003, p. 122).INTRODUCTIONA fundamental test of the common school’s legitimacy is this: Can thecommon school ideal, and the liberal political principles that underwrite it,coherently accommodate reasonable and legitimate forms of moral andcultural diversity, especially those forms that have historically beenmarginalised, discriminated against or excluded? In this paper, I focus onan especially urgent challenge to the legitimacy of the common schoolideal—one that has hardly been addressed within contemporary debateswithin liberal philosophy of education.1 This challenge arises from claimsJournal of Philosophy of Education, Vol. 41, No. 4, 2007r 2007 The AuthorJournal compilationr 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain.

At its simplest, the question I wish to address is how liberalprinciples that underwrite the common school ideal are capable, if they arecapable at all, of providing a coherent ethical and educational basis foraccommodating and recognising queer people and queer identities.QUEER THEORY MEETS LIBERALISM: FUTURITY, AUTONOMY ANDFLOURISHINGThe view that liberal theory and liberal educational institutions cannotadequately accommodate the legitimate claims of queer children (andadults) has recently been advanced by queer theorists who are beginningto critically engage with the arguments of ‘mainstream’ liberalphilosophers of education. A good example of the willingness on thepart of queer theorists to engage critically with liberal arguments can befound in recent articles by Cris Mayo (2006a, 2006b), and for that reasonher work provides the primary reference point in queer theory for myarguments in this paper.Perhaps Mayo’s deepest concern is that liberalism, and the educationalinstitutions it sponsors, have thus far failed to address, and perhaps cannotaddress, the fact that ‘queer children are denied a sense of futurity’ inliberal societies and in public schools (Mayo, 2006a, p. 473). As Mayoputs it, ‘For a philosophy and political practice dedicated to interrogatingtraditions and opening possibilities for innovation, liberalism has beensuspiciously unwilling to extend its analysis to sexual freedom, itsembrace of autonomy to queer critique, its sense of progression towardnew possibilities to queer futurities’ (p. 471).In developing a liberal response to queer theory’s concerns, I followMayo’s usage of the terms ‘queer’, ‘queer identity’ and ‘queer children’.According to Mayo, ‘one reason theorists have turned to using the concept‘‘queer’’ is to underline the uncertainty and shifts in sexual identities,practices, and communities’ that queerness raises for queer people andcommunities, and for the wider population (p. 469). A number ofcomplexities are worth attending to here. First, ‘queerness’ refers to morethan a person’s sexual desire or preferred sexual behaviour. For example,it implies a certain orientation to the ways in which one’s gay, lesbian,bisexual or transgendered identity unsettles and ‘disrupts’ dominantheterosexual norms, roles, laws and communities. Thus, there is an overtlypolitical element to the term that is lacking or less prominent in terms like‘homosexual’ or ‘sexual orientation’. This political element is explicitlyoppositional with respect to the dominance and exclusiveness ofheterosexual norms and assumptions in law, policy and public institutions.The term ‘queer identity’ also suggests an affiliation with self-identifiedqueer communities. Not all homosexual people will accept queeraffiliations in this sense, though queer theorists will argue that queerness796 K. McDonoughr 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britainstill applies in a more limited sense to all gay, lesbian, bisexual andtransgendered people, even in the absence of felt affiliation. For example,some people with homosexual desires may live their lives in heterosexualmarriages. And some homosexual couples will live according to roles andvalues that seamlessly merge with those of many heterosexual families;and they may have little interest in highlighting or drawing attention to themain difference between them and their heterosexual neighbours—the factthat both partners in the relationship share the same gender. Nevertheless,as queer theorists will point out, that difference may not be missed andmay not be accepted by the heterosexual neighbours and citizens withwhom gay and lesbian couples must share a society and polis; and the lawsand political policies of the liberal state may not include them as equalcitizens in many respects. In this way, the concept of ‘queerness’ capturesa sort of social ‘rupture’ that is present even when homosexuals reject thequeer identity label.Finally, and most importantly, the term ‘queer children’ refers to childrenwhose sexual identity is not simply ‘in formation’ as are the sexualidentities of all children, but children whose identities depend upon socialcategories that are as yet not widely understood or recognised, and often areexcluded by liberal law, or within public political and social discourseswithin liberal societies. Because these identities are poorly understood,because they are viewed with considerable ‘animus’ by heterosexualcitizens, and because their sexual differences are not assigned equal valuewithin liberal law and politics, Mayo argues that queer children are ‘barelyrecognizable’, particularly in public schools (p. 469).I am particularly concerned with issues having to do with the‘recognition’ and accommodation of queer children in common schools.However, it might seem that the preceding discussion of queerness makesthe notion of ‘queer children’ and their recognition in schools a problematicone. If children’s identities are still developing into forms that are poorlyunderstood, in part because those forms are still emerging and changing,then it might seem premature to speak of the need to support and recognisethose identities in schools. For one thing, it is not clear what is beingsupported and recognised; and as such it may be that the intention to‘recognise’ and ‘support’ gets distorted into forms that are both anti-liberaland against the best interests of queer children. For example, if identities arepoorly understood, then the danger may arise that schools will socialisechildren into pre-existing moulds based on educators’ distorted andinauthentic conception of what a queer identity should be, rather thanleaving children free to choose and endorse their own conceptions ofqueerness through an examination of how queer people actually might liveworthwhile lives.2 In addition to impeding children’s autonomy, thiseducational approach would constitute a damaging form of identitymisrecognition, since it would change and distort queer identities (perhapsunintentionally), rather than recognise them.Here I want to stress two points. First, the demand for queer recognitionneed not assume that we know beforehand precisely what forms of queersocial identity forms are being recognised; nor does it require that we beThe ‘Futures’ of Queer Children and the Common School Ideal 797r 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britainable to identify exactly which children are ‘queer children’ and whichones are not, so that we can on that basis ‘recognise’ them accordingly.Rather, it assumes that some children will discover at some point in theirdevelopment—perhaps not until they are adults—that they cannot livewell as heterosexuals. Furthermore, it is precisely because we cannot pickout beforehand which children these will be that all children requireexposure to alternative models of identity, including queer models, uponwhich to base their developing individual sexual identities (for acompatible view see, for example, Brighouse, 2000, pp. 74–5; Brighouse,2006, pp. 17–18).The second point I want to emphasise is that the demand for queerrecognition need not assume that the boundaries between queer childrenand heterosexual or ‘straight’ children are crystal clear and absolutelyfixed. Again, the main assumption underlying the demand for queerrecognition in common schools is that some children will find that theiridentities simply cannot ‘synch up’ comfortably with conceptions of goodliving that heterosexuality provides. For these children, sexual identitywill not be a matter of choice, or it will be a matter of limited choicebecause it will exclude heterosexual options while remaining open to avariety of alternatives. But this is compatible with a wide range of(necessarily speculative) views about the ultimate origins and sources ofsexuality and sexual difference. It may be, for example, that for manychildren the discovery that their queer identity is not a matter of choice is acomplex matter of socialisation and genetic endowment. For others, thequestion of whether to live as a heterosexual or as a homosexual or as abisexual person may seem more open-ended. It may also be that, for some,heterosexuality and homosexuality are ‘phases’ through which one passes.This is not objectionable speculation from the liberal point of view so longas we acknowledge both possible tracks along which the ‘phase’ mightconstitute a moment of progression. That is, it must be acknowledged thatone child might develop in such a way such that her heterosexuality is aphase in an otherwise homosexual life; while a different child coulddevelop in such a way that homosexuality is a phase in a life whose futureis heterosexual (Reiss, 1997, p. 348).The significance of these two points is this. Although we may lackcertainty about which children will turn out to be ‘queer’ and althoughthere may be differing views about how fixed (or fluid) we should interpretsexual identities to be, some children will turn out to reject heterosexualways of life and heterosexual identities, and in some cases this will not bea matter of choice at all; in other cases it will be a matter of choice onlyamong various non-heterosexual identities; in still other cases there maybe a choice to alter one’s sexuality in order to adjust it to newcircumstances and new self-knowledge. Thus, uncertainty and disagree-ment about how to draw the line between queer and non-queer identitiesdoes not obviate the need for an exploration of why and how liberalcommon schools might accommodate queer identities. Such an elabora-tion is needed in order to ensure that children have educationalopportunities that include the possibility of a ‘queer future’.798 K. McDonoughr 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great BritainLIBERAL AUTONOMY AND ‘FUTURITY’What does all this have to do with liberal education and the recognition ofqueerness in the common school? The connections to liberalism mayalready seem quite clear, at least in outline—especially the connection toliberal concerns about democratic citizenship and personal autonomy. Butdoes pursuing these educational aims require something that we mightwant to call the ‘recognition’ of queerness and queer identities in commonschools? to address this question, I begin with John White’s recentcomments:A core liberal value is personal autonomy. An autonomous person is onewho determines how he or she should live according to their own,unpressured, picture of a worthwhile life. But autonomy on its own is notenough. A tyrant might also value this, but only for himself, just as acertain sort of elitist might think autonomy fine for the upper classes towhich she belongs, but not for the common people. A liberal makes nosuch discriminations among persons: personal autonomy is a goodapplicable to all. Equality of consideration is, therefore, a second coreliberal value (White, 2003, p. 147).The connection White emphasises between autonomy and equalconsideration is crucially important, since it highlight’s liberalism’s concernto extend autonomy to individuals from historically excluded and margin-alised groups. Liberal schooling is, of course, seen as a vital instrument forextending autonomy in this way. It follows from this claim that theautonomy of queer children is as valuable and important a political andeducational concern of the liberal state as that of any other child. It alsofollows that liberal education cannot legitimately ‘educate children awayfrom queer futures’ any more than it can educate children ‘away fromheterosexual futures’ (Mayo, 2006a, p. 473). These are matters forautonomous choice, and liberal education must treat them as such.EQUAL CONSIDERATION: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEENSPELUNKING AND QUEERNESS?Why, though, does equal consideration of autonomy require explicitrecognition of queer identities? In order to autonomously choose a life as aspelunker,3 centred on the goods and skills of spelunking, I need not havebeen familiarised with the activity of spelunking itself until adulthood.Certain cognitive and affective capacities developed as a child, in relationto an examination of other ways of life may have prepared me sufficientlyto evaluate this and other ways of life, that I did not become familiar withuntil after my schooling had ended. The question arises, then, why doespromoting the autonomy of queer children require that we familiarisechildren with queer ways of life and ‘queer identities’ prior to adulthood?Here I ask this question without considering the school’s role. What Imean to ask, simply, is why we might think that children’s autonomyThe ‘Futures’ of Queer Children and the Common School Ideal 799r 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britaindepends on their becoming familiar with specifically queer roles and queercommunities and queer identities? Why are not generic capacities forcritical thinking and sympathetic imagination for alternative ways of lifesufficient? The reason it is important to answer these questions is that ifthe failure explicitly to expose children to queer ways of life does notaffect the development of their autonomy, then we have no reason tosuppose that a concern for children’s autonomy requires the school torecognise queer identities. But if queer children’s autonomy does dependon actual engagement with queer options, then there exists a compellingprima facie reason for the common school to facilitate such engagement. Ishall argue that the compelling prima facie reason does exist, and that itentails a form of ‘recognition’ for queerness in common schools.Alasdair MacIntyre’s comments on how the ability to imagine differentfutures is connected to the capacity for practical reasoning are extremelyhelpful here. MacIntyre is interested in particular in understanding thevarious dimensions of ‘the child’s transition from dependent infancy to theagency of an independent practical reasoner’ (MacIntyre, 1999, p. 72).One such dimension, he notes, is the acquisition of the ability to imagine‘different possible futures for me’. The full passage in which this commentoccurs is worth quoting:How we structure our understanding of the future depends in part ofcourse on the established use of clocks, calendars, and modes ofscheduling of the culture in which we find ourselves. But as a practicalreasoner I have to be able to imagine different possible futures for me, toimagine myself moving forward from the starting point of the present indifferent directions. For different or alternative futures present me withdifferent and alternative sets of goods to be achieved, with differentpossible modes of flourishing. And it is important that I should be able toenvisage both nearer and more distant futures and to attach possibilities,even if only in a rough and ready way, to the future results of acting in oneway rather than another. For this both knowledge and imagination arenecessary (MacIntyre, 1999, pp. 74–5).MacIntyre here is writing in the context of a discussion of how disabledchildren might be subjected to ‘too constrained and impoverished a viewof future possibilities’ (p. 75) in what might be called ‘able-normative’societies.4 Importantly, according to MacIntyre’s account, the impover-ishment of imagination about disabled children’s ‘future possibilities’ isnot primarily a characteristic of the disabled individual (though itobviously affects the disabled more profoundly than it does the abled).Rather, it is a characteristic primarily of ‘the groups of which [the disabledchild] is a member’. To illustrate: one example of the way in which able-normativity exerts a withering pressure on the ‘imagined possible futures’of disabled children lies in what Hans Reinders calls ‘the presumption ofsuffering’ of the disabled and those who care for them (Reinders, 2000,ch. 10). As MacIntyre notes, something like this presumption is oftenattached to characteristics such as ‘blindness, deafness, deformed andinjured limbs, and the like . . .’; and because this presumption suffuses800 K. McDonoughr 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britaincommunal norms, institutions, modes of relationship, etc., it and othersimilarly harmful presumptions ‘exclude the sufferer from more than avery, very limited set of possibilities. And this has often been treated as ifit were a fact of nature’ (MacIntyre, 1999, p. 75).What MacIntyre’s discussion highlights, most importantly, is howcommunal attitudes, norms and relationships help to ‘structure our under-standing of the future’ at the level of individual development, upbringingand education. Furthermore, important elements of communal life thatstructure the development (or lack of development) of skills of inde-pendent practical reasoning are mutually reinforcing sets of rules (laws),virtues and practices. Without sustained and engaged exposure to theseelements of a community in ‘good order’ then the capacities forindependent practical reasoning can develop only inadequately, in waysthat diminish our individual and communal ‘view of future possibilities’(p. 85).These reflections on the ways in which the agency of disabled people isdependent on (in part) communally structured ‘visions of futurepossibility’ apply similarly to the case of queer children. If thecommunities of which children are a part (here I do not just mean thosechildren who turn out to be queer, but all children) fail to includeexpansive visions of queer possibilities, then the ability of queer children(i.e. those who turn out to be unable to live their lives as heterosexuals) todevelop into independent practical reasoners will be constrained to theextent that they will be unable to link up their reasoning to realistic andexpansive ‘imagined futures’ involving valuable and worthwhile queerroles, communities and identities. Relatedly, they will not be able acquiresufficient knowledge of the goods those communities afford theirmembers, and they will be unable to achieve a sufficiently vivid senseof the virtues, practices and rules that provide group members with ameaningful understanding of what their respective intermediate and long-term alternative future possibilities might consist in.The problem in the case of queer children is not just that theircommunities lack a sufficiently expansive range of queer futures. Rather,the problem is also that those communities may actively to foreclose queerpossibilities as children’s capacities of independent practical reasoning aredeveloping. These forces of foreclosure are even more powerful in thecase of queer children (arguably) than they are in the case of disabledchildren. And one reason for this has to do with the differences of familyrelationship that structure queer children’s futures differently from thoseof other children, including children with disabilities.QUEER CHILDREN AND THE FAMILYIn societies where heterosexual roles and norms are dominant in politics,law and civil society, numerous socially acceptable and approvedpathways for heterosexual identity development are available for childrento examine and choose from. Furthermore, families are likely to supportand encourage children’s access to and familiarity with at least some if notThe ‘Futures’ of Queer Children and the Common School Ideal 801r 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britainmany of these different social contexts so as to increase their opportunitiesand to expand their imaginative horizons. At the very least, they are notlikely to restrict children’s access to heterosexual roles and communitiessimply because those roles are heterosexual ones. Furthermore, hetero-sexual children can usually count on a good deal of parental love, supportand care as they grow up; or at least their sexuality does not usuallypresent the prospect of the parental withdrawal or rejection as it may forqueer children. At any rate, the development of a capacity for personalautonomy and well-being is not typically threatened for heterosexualchildren due to the lack of available or valuable heterosexual role models,communities, etc., though the development of these same capacities maybe threatened for just these reasons in the case of queer children.Queer roles and communities are also available within liberal civilsocieties, and as such they are potentially accessible to queer children andqueer youth. But the availability and accessibility in this case iscomparatively thin and restricted, especially when it comes to children.First, queer communities may be few and far between—in part becausethose adult forms of community tend to be concentrated in certain areas oflarge urban centres (Levy, 2005, p. 183). Furthermore, queer communitiesare likely to be subject to strong social and parental disapproval; and thusexposure and access to these communities for young people will often beviewed as harmful and dangerous, rather than as providing a rich andtextured social fabric for positive identity formation. Finally, queerchildren are more likely than heterosexual children to be members offamilies that do not favour their sexual identity and that thus seek tochange it, impede it or at the very least neglect its development andflourishing. Problematically, then, on the one hand, queer and ‘proto-queer’children will often find that their emerging sense of personal identity fitsuncomfortably, if at all, into the socially accepted ‘heteronormative’pathways. On the other hand, the adults who have the power over andresponsibility for queer children’s sense of future possibilities are unlikelyto facilitate access to queer communities that might support a moreexpansive sense of future queer possibilities.At the same time, the extra-familial communities of which queerchildren are members—families, neighbourhoods, churches, local com-munity organisations, etc.—will likely reinforce a diminished sense offuture queer possibilities, rather than expand them. This will not always bedue to ‘animus’ towards queerness or queer people. Rather, it may resultfrom the lack of fit between social categories available for identityrecognition, on the one hand, and queer children’s complex self-understandings, on the other hand. Thus, for example, a child’s parentsmay be scrupulously committed to liberal principles of non-discriminationwhile also expressing disapproval and confusion at their son’s periodic and(to the parents) unpredictable flirtations with cross-gender dressing. As thisexample illustrates, heterosexual families and communities will often lackconcrete, phenomenological understandings of how people who identifyinconsistently or not at all with established gender categories negotiate theircomplex self-understandings. As such, their child’s self-understanding is802 K. McDonoughr 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britainlikely to exist in part in the interstices of his family’s or his localcommunity’s accepted social identity categories. And thus even thesympathetic heterosexual family or community may be ill-equipped tohelp a queer child make the transition from the confusions and dislocationassociated with interstitial self-understanding to socially accepted andmeaningful identity. Thus, queer children who grow up in heterosexualfamilies and communities will likely find themselves in social contextsthat provide too limited a set of experiences to ‘navigate the complexityand possibility of language’, experience and meaning they need in order toexplore ‘future possibilities’ (Mayo, 2006b, p. 43). This also constitutes animportant difference between queer children and heterosexual children;hetero-sexual children are far more likely to have substantial exposure tocaring communities and families that provide expansive and meaningfulvisions of their future possibilities.These complexities of sexuality can and do create considerableconfusion and distortion about queer sexual identities, both from theperspective of queer children themselves and on the part of non-queerpeople whose responses to and interpretations of queerness, or perhapsabsence of response to and lack of interpretation of queerness, play animportant role in the shaping of queer identities. These confusions arelikely to have harmful effects on queer children’s identity formation—on their autonomous flourishing. Martha Nussbaum neatly summarisesthe complex and various ways in which processes of misrecognitionand lack of recognition toward queer people can cause harm: ‘LikeE.M. Forster’s character Maurice, many gay and lesbian [and, Mayowould add, bisexual and transgendered people] seem indistinguishablefrom nongay people—or, rather, distinguishable only by the experience ofdiscovering that what they want is socially unacceptable’ (Nussbaum,2000, p. 232).Unlike that of heterosexual children, whether they come from religiousor non-religious families, the experience of growing up in a hetero-normatively constituted society may be an experience of pervasivehostility and harm. It may also be an experience of growing up in familiesand communities that lack expansive possibilities for ‘queer futures’; andit is likely to be an experience that insulates one from or bars access tomore friendly and hospitable queer communities and social contexts. Butif MacIntyre is right, as he surely is, that individual agency and flourishingdepend on ‘knowledge and imagination’ about one’s future possibilitiesand that this must be developed through concrete, phenomenologicallyrich encounters with real communities, stories and identities, then theproblems facing queer children seem especially severe. The fundamentalproblem may not be that queer children have fewer opportunities thanheterosexual children to develop a sense of autonomous flourishing. Theproblem may be that queer children’s education and upbringing providesso little exposure to the material conditions of individual agency andpractical reasoning about future possibilities that queer lack anysignificant opportunities for flourishing at all. (For a different butcompatible argument, see Brighouse, 2000, p. 73.) This point highlightsThe ‘Futures’ of Queer Children and the Common School Ideal 803r 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britainthe need for children to have access to actual queer communities andraises the question of what role the common school might play.Here we can return to the example of the hypothetical autonomousspelunker that began this discussion. The autonomous adult canpresumably choose spelunking as a way of life, without having beenexposed to that way of life in his upbringing or education, because twoimportant conditions are met. First, spelunking is a way of life that isavailable within a social sub-community whose practices, rules and virtuesare practised and taught in such a way that I can learn them if exposed tothem. Second, my upbringing and education as an independent practicalreasoner has not already foreclosed spelunking as an option for me by thetime I am exposed to it. That option is ‘open’ as a future possibility (in thiscase, the very near future) because it is continuous with and unimpededby what I have learned as a developing independent practical reasonerup until this point. My society is not pervasively and intensely ‘anti-spelunking’, although spelunking is regarded by most members of mycommunity as an exotic and eccentric way of life. And the skills neededfor spelunking mesh rather smoothly with the norms, virtues and practicesthat I have learned in prior stages of my education and development.There are no serious tensions or conflicts, and numerous areas ofcompatibility and mutual reinforcement between my past identityincarnations (which were once future possibilities as well) and my current‘possible future’—spelunking.But for many queer children, neither of these conditions can be taken forgranted at the outset. And as a result, the task of choosing queer options asadults is likely to be sharply discontinuous with their development as‘practical reasoners’, rather than continuous as in the case of theautonomous spelunker. The point I want to stress is just this. That the‘transition from dependent infant to independent practical reasoner’ thatMacIntyre speaks of requires a certain sort of educational community—acommunity that children lack in the home or in most locally availablegroups. Furthermore, independent practical reasoning is constitutive ofautonomy. The capacity for autonomy, like the capacity for independentpractical reasoning, cannot be based on either wishful thinking based onhighly abstract fantasies, or by a restricted imagination based on a limitedrange of options that excludes many worthwhile possibilities. As such,queer children require exposure to queer communities that provideexpansive visions of future possibilities as queer people.LIBERALISM, THE COMMON SCHOOL IDEAL AND QUEER FUTURESIn the preceding section I articulated and defended three interlockingclaims. First, the development of personal autonomy depends upon anupbringing and education that attends to the conditions necessary fordeveloping and exercising certain capacities of practical reasoning.Second, these capacities of practical reasoning are essential for childrento have a vision of possible ‘queer futures’. Third, developing these804 K. McDonoughr 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britaincapacities of reasoning depends in part on children developing areasonably thick familiarity with and understanding of actual queer livesand queer communities.These conclusions suggest some relatively straightforward practicalrecommendations for the recognition of queerness in the common school.In this section, I would like to briefly address five areas of concern.First, common schools would need to make serious and sustainedattempts to address issues of what seems to be pervasive and persistentviolence, bullying and other forms of harassment against queer children inschools. In the US, schools such as the Harvey Milk School in New YorkCity have been established specifically for gay, lesbian and transgenderedkids. These schools are partially funded by public money; and the use ofpublic funds is justified in part because these schools are a response to thewidespread violence and emotional harm that queer children experience inpublic schools, in their families and in the wider society (Dennis andHarlow, 1986; see also Mayo, 2006a).5 As D.L. Dennis and R.E. Harlowexplain, the students in schools such as the Harvey Milk School have oftenbeen subjected to violence at the hands of other students and teachers.Furthermore, this abuse is sometimes tacitly endorsed by school adminis-trators who refuse to extend protection to queer students even when theybecome aware that abuse is occurring, and even when they are aware ofwhich specific individuals are committing the abuse (Dennis and Harlow,1986, pp. 446–456). Mayo emphasises throughout her paper the multipleand complex ways in which ‘animus’ against queers might manifest itself inliberal societies and in common schools, and she emphasises the fact thatmerely adopting official policies of anti-discrimination—for example,speech codes or anti-bullying policies—does not sufficiently address theways in which discriminatory and violent treatment toward queer studentscan persist in the presence of such policies, since teachers, administratorsand students often fail to recognise such treatment when it occurs; and theymay recognise it but nonetheless tolerate it or overlook it when queerstudents are the target. Where deep-seated animus towards queerness exists,individuals will find creative and sometimes hard-to-identify ways ofrationalising and obscuring officially prohibited discrimination andviolence. Certainly, ensuring the psychological, emotional and physicalwell-being of children is a precondition of their developing capacities ofautonomous practical reasoning, if anything is.A second area that requires attention is the curriculum. In order todevelop realistic and valuable conception of possible queer futures,children would need detailed and rich examples of queer role models. Thismight include narratives (historical and fictional) of gay, lesbian andtransgendered people that provide a sense of the fullness of their lives.These stories would also need to be incorporated into the curriculum notas tokenistic ‘special features’ that highlight the eccentricity or exoticnature of queer lives and communities. They would need to beincorporated seamlessly as part of children’s educational induction intothe complex and multi-faceted, cosmopolitan cultural context of liberal-democratic societies. Narratives and other cultural products includingThe ‘Futures’ of Queer Children and the Common School Ideal 805r 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britainqueer elements would need to address issues not merely to do with the‘different’ sexual behaviour and sexual desires of gay, lesbian andtransgendered people, but also concerning the ways in which theirqueerness has affected the social, personal, economic and politicaldimensions of their lives. Attention would need to be given to the ways inwhich contemporary liberal societies have broached or failed to broachissues of queer oppression and discrimination, and also the ways in whichanti-discriminatory legal and political policies address certain aspects ofinequality while leaving other aspects of social life unchanged, at least inthe short term, as it pertains to the construction and treatment of queerpeople. It would also need to address the ways in which laws thatincorporate heterosexual norms affect both personal and political aspectsof life for queer individuals and queer communities.A third important area of concern is teacher training and hiringpractices. Teachers in the common school would need to be knowledge-able about queer life and also be disposed to treat the complex nature ofqueerness (e.g., in its political, legal, social and personal dimensions)both generously and critically. This is necessary in order to providechildren with a realistic picture of what possible queer lives mightinvolve. Relatedly, it is necessary for providing children with either anexcessively discouraging picture of the struggles against oppression thatsuch lives often entail, or an excessively unrealistic and fantastic pictureof the goods and values that can be derived from such a life. In order tocultivate the capacity for personal autonomy rooted in concrete abilitiesof practical reasoning, the aim should be to provide a richly concrete,nuanced and detailed, future-oriented sense of what such lives involve.In this way, attempts to attract queer teachers for teacher educationprogrammes, and for public schools, should be included as policypriorities for the common school. And all teachers should be providedwith training that would equip them to undertake competently the tasksoutlined above.Furthermore, and fourth, attention should be given to the fact that schoolofficials and school boards are not always, to say the least, supportive ofteachers like those described in the preceding paragraph (Reiss, 1997,p. 350). And so in addition to broadly based, sometimes legally imposed,policies of anti-discrimination based on ‘sexual orientation’, someserious attempts must be made to ensure that official policies are appliedin such a fashion as to take account of the manner in which queerchildren may be discriminated against in ‘hidden’ or at least ignoredways within the textured, complex social life of school communities.Here, MacIntyre’s point about the complex and mutually reinforcingrelationships of laws (or rules, such as speech codes and the like),practices and virtues within communal life apply with some force toschool communities.Fifth, and finally, attempts to address issues of recognition andaccommodation of queerness and queer identities must address in someway the role that specifically queer communities might play in children’seducation. As Mayo puts it, ‘because liberal theorists consider levels of806 K. McDonoughr 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britaincivic engagement to move from family to state, they miss the place of sub-communities and social movements in shaping who youth may becomeand how they may arrange their lives’ (Mayo, 2006a, p. 484). Here therole that state-supported common schools might play is limited but stillsignificant. Common schools cannot simulate or emulate queer sub-communities; nor can they adopt queer communal values as ‘constitutive’of the school community. Doing so would violate liberal commitments toinclusiveness and equal consideration. Nevertheless, common schoolsmight seek to find creative ways to foster links and interactions with queercommunities. Where possible, this might be done through field trips, guestspeakers and perhaps consultations with queer activists regarding theinclusion of queer issues within the school curriculum. Where actualinteraction is impossible, due to geographical concerns for example,virtual interaction is possible through web-based learning models. In anycase, children’s awareness of and familiarity with such communities willbe an important part of their education, especially as they make thetransition from family and school-based lives to lives of greaterindependence from those institutions.CONCLUSION: QUEER THEORY AND LIBERALISM—IS A CIVILUNION POSSIBLE?In seeking to advance the aims of queer liberation, liberalism is often thefavoured target of queer critique. This is understandable and sometimesappropriate, especially when the liberalism they challenge is that of liberalrealpolitik and of existing liberal educational practices and institutions.Nevertheless, my general conclusion in this paper has been that liberalprinciples of justice and their educational correlates need not stand in theway of political and educational reforms that significantly accommodatequeer recognition in public schools. Moreover, I have tried to show thatliberal principles can help to advance the aims of queer recognition morefully than is commonly acknowledged, by either liberal or queer theorists.In particular, I have tried to illuminate some promising routes forextending liberal recognition to queer children and queer communitieswithin public schools.Nevertheless, it is also important to acknowledge that queer theory andliberalism are to some extent at least embarked on divergent projects.Liberalism is a political theory that seeks to define more clearly the limitsof state power over individual lives and seeks to clarify the sorts ofeducational practices that an appropriately constrained state needs in orderto maintain its legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens, and in order to upholdjustice within its borders. The constraints that the liberal state must respectinclude, most importantly, those that arise from social facts of cultural andmoral diversity. And the educational practices needed for ensuringlegitimacy and justice in a liberal state are deeply shaped by these samefacts. Queer theory is not similarly constrained. It is, in part, a theoreticalmanifestation of a social movement aimed primarily at advancing theThe ‘Futures’ of Queer Children and the Common School Ideal 807r 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation r 2007 Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britaininterests of queer people. In doing so, it is, according to Mayo, ‘essentiallya movement that disrupts norms’; and queer theory may emphasiseand encourage these disruptions without necessarily paying muchattention to how liberal norms and values might be reinterpreted in lightof the new circumstances and considerations raised by queerness (Mayo,2006a, p. 472).The moral constraints constitutive of liberal politics place limits on theextent to which the liberal state can influence the shaping of a child’sidentity. But they also must impose limits on the authority of cultural,sexual, religious and other sub-communities to shape children’s moralcommitments and identity. Importantly, the best answers to the question ofwhat these limits should be are not permanently fixed (Feinberg andMcDonough, 2003, p. 9). The best answers will change, in part due tochanges in understandings about what sorts of identities and commitmentsare compatible with liberal commitments of equal consideration, toleranceand mutual respect among the morally diverse citizens who compriseliberal societies. To that extent, liberal philosophers of education shouldseek to respond to the ‘normative disruptions’ emphasised by queertheory. Liberal philosophy of education should seek to clarify what thebest account of those limits is now, in present conditions; but it also seeksto determine what prospects exist for maximising the individual autonomyof all citizens when present social, legal and political conditionsillegitimately restrict it.But the divergences between queer theory and liberalism should not beoveremphasised. Significantly, as Mayo herself indicates, queer theoristsand advocates are ‘often indebted to liberal theory for their generalnormative commitments’ (Mayo, 2006a, p. 472). These debts may beimplicit or they may be explicitly acknowledged. But the project ofinterpreting the limits of liberal norms and the project of advancing queerinterests are in any case unlikely to track each other perfectly. The task Ihave been engaged with in this paper is to see if progress can be made inunderstanding the extent to which broadly liberal political, moral andeducational commitments can be aligned more snugly with a wider, morediverse set of social practices—in particular, practices that are congenialto queer people and to the flourishing of queer children.I do not know if the forms of educational recognition and accommoda-tion I have recommended in this paper will be sufficiently robust to satisfythe concerns of queer theorists and activists. If they are not, then it may bethat my arguments in this paper are wrong and queer theorists like CrisMayo are right when they argue that liberalism cannot adequately addressthe educational concerns that queerness raises. But it may also be thatqueer advocates, like advocates of all the various sub-communities withinliberal societies, need to adjust their expectations of what liberalism, as apolitical theory, can be expected to accomplish in the name of anyparticular group and its members. However that may be, my hope is thatthe arguments and ideas in this paper will contribute to an ongoingdialogue that will teach us how common schools might better serve theinterests of queer citizens.6808 K.

Some more or less liberally minded educational theorists have addressed issues of teaching abouthomosexuality as a controversial moral issue (Callan, 2000; Halstead and Lewicka, 1998; Reiss,1997). However, issues of queer identity have not been discussed in any sustained way in therecent voluminous literature on issues at the intersection of liberalism, cultural identity andeducation. One notable exception is McKay (1998). Alexander McKay’s discussion draws heavilyon John Rawls in developing his arguments on sexuality education, but rather than treatingsexuality in terms of cultural and identity diversity, he treats these issues as centrally involvingideological pluralism.2. Thanks to Mark Halstead for helping me to clarify this point.3. That is, a caver or speliologist.4. The admittedly awkward label ‘able-normative’ is mine, not MacIntyre’s. I use it simply tohighlight the parallel with Mayo’s ‘heteronormative’.5. The need for separate schools for queer students is surely regrettable, especially when it is anemergency response to violence and bullying. But if such extreme measures are in some cases theonly feasible option, then public funding should at least be sufficient to provide an adequateeducation. According to Dennis and Harlow, ‘The Harvey Milk School is essentially a one-roomschoolhouse, staffed only by one full-time and one half-time teacher. The New York City Board ofEducation pays their salaries . . . but all other expenses of the school . . . must be paid for [byprivate fund raising efforts]’ (Dennis and Harlow, 1986, p. 455).6. Mark Halstead and Paul Standish were exceptionally gracious editors of this paper. Both of themprovided critical comments, late in the day, on an earlier draft. Without their help, for which I amvery grateful, I could not have finished this paper in time to have it included in this special issuededicated to Terry McLaughlin. I have also benefited a great deal from Liz Airton’s insights onqueer theory. It has been a delight to learn from her in our numerous conversations over the pastfew months.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on an especially urgent challenge to the legitimacy of the common school ideal—a challenge that has hardly been addressed within contemporary debates within liberal philosophy of education. The challenge arises from claims to accommodation by queer people and queer communities—claims that are based on notions of queerness and queer identity that are seriously underrepresented within contemporary liberal political and educational theory. The paper articulates a liberal view of personal autonomy that is constituted by a conception of practical reasoning rooted in thick communal experiences. It is argued that common schools concerned with equal concern for the autonomy of all children must attend to the specific communal requirements needed to developing the autonomous practical reasoning of queer children—requirements for what is termed a sense of ‘futurity’. Five practical recommendations for common schools are briefly outlined. The paper concludes with some reflections on the divergent and convergent interests of queer theory and liberalism, and considers some possibilities for a partial reconciliation of the two theoretical perspectives",
