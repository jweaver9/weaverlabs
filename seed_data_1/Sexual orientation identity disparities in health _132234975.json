Jackson1*, Madina Agénor2,3, Dayna A. Johnson4, S. Bryn Austin2,5 and Ichiro Kawachi2AbstractBackground: Research shows that sexual minorities (e.g., lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals) experience higherlevels of discrimination, stigma, and stress and are at higher risk of some poor health outcomes and healthbehaviors compared to their heterosexual counterparts. However, the majority of studies have examined sexualorientation disparities in a narrow range of health outcomes and behaviors using convenience samples comprisedof either men or women living in restricted geographic areas.Methods: To investigate the relationship between sexual orientation identity and health among U.S. women andmen, we used Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate prevalence ratios for health behaviors, outcomes,and services use comparing sexual minorities to heterosexual individuals using 2013 and 2014 National HealthInterview Survey data (N = 69,270).Results: Three percent of the sample identified as sexual minorities. Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian(prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.65 [95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 2.37]) and bisexual (PR = 2.16 [1.46, 3.18]) womenwere more likely to report heavy drinking. Lesbians had a higher prevalence of obesity (PR = 1.20 [1.02, 1.42]), stroke(PR = 1.96 [1.14, 3.39]), and functional limitation (PR = 1.17 [1.02, 1.34] than heterosexual women. Gay men were morelikely to have hypertension (PR = 1.21 [1.03, 1.43]) and heart disease (PR = 1.39 [1.02, 1.88]). Despite no difference in healthinsurance status, sexual minorities were more likely than heterosexual individuals to delay seeking healthcare because ofcost; however, members of this group were also more likely to have received an HIV test and initiated HPV vaccination.Conclusion: Sexual minorities had a higher prevalence of some poor health behaviors and outcomes.Keywords: Sexual orientation, Health behaviors, Health outcomes, United StatesBackgroundThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services hasidentified understanding and improving the health oflesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) popula-tions as a national priority. Indeed, Healthy People 2020has set new objectives and targets for monitoring andpromoting LGBT health [1]. Moreover, the Institute ofMedicine released a report underscoring the need toconduct additional research on the health of all LGBTpopulations across the life course, including using na-tional probability samples [2].Studies show that many sexual minorities – namely,individuals who self-identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexualand who engage in same-gender sexual behavior or re-port same-gender sexual attractions but do not self-identify as such – have a higher prevalence of health riskbehaviors [3, 4] and poor health outcomes [4–8] and alower prevalence of access to health insurance as well ashealthcare [4, 5, 7, 9] compared to their heterosexualcounterparts, even after controlling for socioeconomicposition (SEP). Few studies, however, have generated na-tionally representative estimates for a range of health* Correspondence: Chandra_Jackson@hms.harvard.edu1Clinical and Translational Science Center, Harvard Catalyst, Harvard MedicalSchool, 10 Shattuck Street, Boston, MA 02215, USAFull list of author information is available at the end of the article© 2016 The Author(s).

BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:807 DOI 10.1186/s12889-016-3467-1and healthcare measures by sexual orientation identitywhile using a sample size large enough to provide esti-mates for both U.S. men and women in the same study.Therefore, we examined sexual orientation identity dis-parities in health behaviors, health outcomes, and health-care access and utilization indicators using data from the2013 and 2014 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS),which is based on a national probability sample of adultU.S. men and women. We also investigated the relation-ship between sexual orientation identity and health andhealthcare indicators stratified by two age groups. Ourstudy extends the findings of a recent study that usedNHIS data to assess sexual orientation identity disparitiesin health by investigating understudied aspects of sexualminority health related to a broad set of health behaviors,outcomes, and healthcare services and utilization mea-sures [10]. This study also extends previous findingsby adjusting for potential confounders and using alarger sample size among both men and women.Based on the minority stress model, which postulatesthat sexual orientation disparities in health are due tosexual minorities’ unique exposure to stigma anddiscrimination that can be experienced differentlydepending on gender and age group [11–15], wehypothesized that sexual minorities have a higher preva-lence of health behaviors and poor health outcomes and alower prevalence of health services use compared to het-erosexual persons across gender and age groups. Thesedata will help future studies identify potential drivers ofdisparities among sexual minorities and test mechanismsposited by the Minority Stress Model.MethodsThe national health interview surveyWe analyzed data from the National Health InterviewSurvey (NHIS), which is a series of cross-sectional,nationally representative surveys that use a three-stagestratified cluster probability sampling design to conductin-person interviews in the households of non-institutionalized U.S. civilians. A detailed description ofNHIS procedures has been published elsewhere [16].Briefly, a probability sample of households was inter-viewed by trained interviewers from the U.S. CensusBureau to obtain information about health and sociode-mographic characteristics of the sampled household ona continuous basis each week. Data were collected usingcomputer-assisted personal interviewing. A randomly se-lected adult and child (not included in this analysis) pro-vided more specific health-related information. The finalresponse rate for sample adults was 81.7 % for 2013 andwas 80.5 % for 2014. The NHIS received writteninformed consent from each study participant. TheHarvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Institu-tional Review Board approved our study.Study participantsParticipants included individuals who self-identified asnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black/African American,Latino/a or Hispanic, Native American/Alaska Native, andAsian (henceforth, white, black, Latino/a, Native American,Asian) adults aged 18 to 85+ years. Participants were ex-cluded if they had missing data (<3 %) on sexual orientationidentity. Our final analytic sample consisted of 69,270adults.MeasuresSexual orientation identityParticipants who were asked “Which of the followingbest represents how you think of yourself?” Responseoptions included: “gay” or “lesbian,” “straight, that is, notlesbian or gay,” “bisexual,” “something else,” and “I don’tknow the answer.” The wording of the question differedslightly for men and women, with men being asked ifthey were “gay” or “straight, that is, not gay” and womenbeing asked if they were “lesbian or gay” or “straight,that is, not lesbian or gay.” Persons who responded“something else” or “I don’t know the answer” wereasked follow-up questions about what they meant by“something else” or “don’t know,” but due to sample sizeconstraints and confidentiality, these follow-up re-sponses and potential explanations were not included inthe publicly available data.Health behaviorsLeisure-time physical activity was categorized as none,low, or high. Participants engaging in at least some levelof activity and providing a specific number of activitybouts were dichotomized at the midpoint and classifiedas low or high. Participants reporting ‘never’ or ‘unableto do this type activity’ were categorized as ‘none.’Current smoking status (based on smoking at least 100cigarettes in entire life) and lifetime alcohol consump-tion (based on having at least 12 drinks in lifetime anddrinking or not in the past year) was categorized ascurrent, former, or never. Based on dietary guidelines,heavy drinking was considered ≥2 drinks per day formen and >1 drink per day for women [17]. We also con-sidered those who consumed five or more drinks on atleast 2 days among men and women for 2013 and five ormore drinks on at least 2 days among men and four ormore drinks on at least 2 days among women for 2014.Participants reported how many hours of sleep they, onaverage, obtained in a 24-hour period. Sleep was catego-rized as <7 h, 7 h, and >7 h. Seven hours of sleep was usedas the reference because it has been associated with thelowest levels of morbidity and mortality [18, 19]. As ameasure of sadness, participants responded to the question,“During the past 30 days, how often did you feel so sad thatnothing could cheer you up?” Participants responded eitherJackson et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:807 Page 2 of 11“all of the time,” “most of the time,” “some of thetime,” “a little of the time,” or “none of the time.”Health outcomesAdults were asked if they had ever been told by a doctoror other health professional that they had “hypertension,also called high blood pressure” and, separately, if theyhad ever been told they had “diabetes or sugar diabetes,”“cancer,” or a “stroke.” Participants were also asked if adoctor or other health professional ever diagnosed themas having coronary heart disease or any kind of heartcondition or disease other than coronary heart disease,angina pectoris, or a myocardial infarction. Self-reportedheight and weight were used to calculate body massindex (BMI) by dividing measured weight in kilogramsby height in meters squared. Obesity was defined asBMI ≥30 kg/m2, overweight as 25.0–29.9 kg/m2, normalweight as 18.5–24.9 kg/m2, and underweight as BMI<18.5 kg/m2. Participants were considered to have afunctional limitation if they reported being limited in en-gaging in specific activities because of a physical, mental,or emotional health problem that did not include preg-nancy. Participants were considered to have experiencedan injury if they reported at least one injury or poisoningepisode serious enough to seek medical advice or treat-ment in the past 3 months.Healthcare access and utilization indicatorsParticipants reported if they currently had health insur-ance coverage and whether they had at least one placethey usually went when sick or needed health advice.Participants also indicated if they had Medicaid coverageover the past month and the number of times they wentto an emergency room regarding their health during thepast 12 months, which we categorized as < or ≥2 visits.Participants reported whether, during the past12 months, they delayed seeking medical care (not in-cluding dental care) because of worry about the cost.Men and women aged 18 to 64 years were asked if theyever had an HPV vaccine. Participants were asked if theyever had an HIV test (not including any tests duringblood donations). We placed self-reported general healthstatus into three categories (excellent or very good,good, and fair or poor).Sociodemographic characteristicsParticipants self-identified with 1 or more of the followingcategories: white, black/African American, American In-dian/Alaskan Native, Asian, and multiple race. Marital sta-tus was categorized as married or living with partner,divorced, separated, or widowed, and never married. Edu-cational attainment was categorized as < high school, highschool (including general equivalency diploma), some col-lege, and ≥ college-level education. Annual householdincome was classified as ‘$0–34,999,”35,000–74,999’ and‘≥$75,000,’ and poverty status was dichotomized for a fam-ily or individual income at and above or below the U.S.Census Bureau’s poverty threshold. Based on type of work,we combined occupations into ‘Professional/management,’‘Support Services’ and ‘Laborer’ categories.Statistical analysisWe used sampling weights to account for the unequalprobabilities of selection resulting from the sample design,survey non-response, and planned oversampling of black,Latino/a, and Asian American individuals and adults aged65 years and over. Standard errors or variance estimationswere calculated using Taylor series linearization. The “sub-pop” command in Stata, version 13 (Stata Corporation,College Station, Texas, USA) was used for correct varianceestimation using the analytic sample. A two-sided p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.We used the direct-adjustment method to calculateage-standardized prevalence estimates of sociodemo-graphic characteristics, health behaviors, health out-comes, and healthcare access and utilization indicatorsamong U.S. men and women (separately) by sexualorientation identity. The age distribution from the 2010U.S. Census was used as the standard population.Poisson regression with robust error variance was usedto estimate gender-specific prevalence ratios for health be-haviors, health outcomes, and services use comparing sex-ual minority and heterosexual individuals [20]. Prevalenceratios were also estimated separately for younger and olderage groups. Determined by sample size and distribution,the younger age group included individuals aged 18–30years, and the older age group was composed of individualsaged 31–85+ years. The aforementioned covariates selecteda priori as potential confounders included age, race/ethni-city, educational attainment, annual household income, oc-cupational class, health status, and region of residence.ResultsCharacteristics of the study sampleThe final analytic sample consisted of 69,270 partici-pants. Table 1 shows the age-standardized prevalence ofsociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors,health outcomes, and health services use by sexualorientation identity among U.S. men and women. Partic-ipants’ mean age was 49.9 ± 0.07 years; 52 % werewomen, and 3 % identified as sexual minorities. Gay andbisexual men and lesbians were generally more likely thanheterosexual individuals to have at least a college educa-tion. Participants who reported not knowing their sexualorientation identity or responded “don’t know or some-thing else” were more likely than heterosexual individualsto live in poverty and be in fair or poor general health.Many bisexual men had at least a college education (46 %)Jackson et al.

In contrast, there were no differencesin sleep duration by sexual orientation identity amongmen and women.Association between sexual orientation identity andhealth outcomesCompared to heterosexual women, lesbians had a 20 %higher prevalence of obesity PR = 1.20 [1.02, 1.42]), 96 %higher prevalence of stroke (PR = 1.96 [1.14, 3.39]), and17 % higher prevalence of having a functional limitation(PR = 1.17 [1.02, 1.34]) (Table 3). Bisexual women hadover a two-fold higher prevalence of sustaining an injuryor poisoning in the past 3 months (PR = 2.49 [1.44,4.32]) and of mostly feeling so sad that nothing couldcheer them up during the past 30 days (PR = 2.10 [1.25,3.54]). Gay men were 21 % (PR = 1.21 [1.03, 1.43]) morelikely to have hypertension and 39 % (PR = 1.39 [1.02,1.88]) more likely to have heart disease compared to het-erosexual men.

Incontrast, these groups were more likely to have initiatedHPV vaccination and received an HIV test. Gay (PR =1.06 [1.01, 1.11]) but not bisexual (PR = 1.04 [0.94, 1.14])men were more likely to have a usual place for carecompared to heterosexual men.Age differences in health behaviors and outcomes bysexual orientation identityTable 4 shows fully adjusted prevalence ratios for healthbehaviors and healthcare access and utilization indica-tors in relation to sexual orientation identity among menand women, stratified by age group (aged 18–30 yearsand 31–85+ years) based on sample size.

Younger bisexual women were 44 %(PR = 1.44 [1.01, 2.05]) more likely to be current alcoholconsumers compared to their heterosexual counterparts.Older lesbian and bisexual women were more likely thanolder heterosexual women to be former drinkers andformer cigarette smokers.

There were also no sexual orientation differ-ences in emergency room visits across age groups. Bothyounger (PR = 2.24 [1.91, 2.62]) and older (PR = 2.23[2.10, 2.36]) gay men as well as younger (PR = 1.76 [1.15,2.69]) and older (PR = 1.67 [1.33, 2.09]) bisexual menwere more likely to report ever getting tested for HIVcompared to heterosexual men. Relative to their hetero-sexual counterparts, older gay (PR = 4.58 [2.32, 9.04])and younger (PR = 2.55 [1.05, 6.20]) bisexual men as wellas younger (PR = 1.40 [1.10, 1.80]) and older (PR = 2.07[1.02, 4.21]) bisexual women were more likely to initiateHPV vaccination. Only older lesbian (PR = 1.27 [1.11,1.45]) and bisexual (PR = 1.32 [1.14, 1.53]) women weremore likely to have ever been tested for HIV relative totheir heterosexual counterparts.DiscussionWe identified important disparities in health behaviors,health outcomes, and healthcare access and utilizationindicators between sexual minorities and heterosexualindividuals in a nationally representative sample of U.S.men and women; several of these disparities varied byspecific sexual orientation identity, gender, and agegroups. We found that heavy drinking ranged from 65 %to an over two-fold higher prevalence among sexual mi-norities compared to heterosexual individuals. Lesbianswere more likely to be obese than heterosexual women,to have suffered a stroke, and to have a functional limi-tation. Bisexual women had over a two-fold higherprevalence of sustaining an injury/poisoning in the past3 months, which may be related to alcohol abuse. Poten-tially related to preventable factors like increased stressor HIV, gay men were more likely to have hypertensionand heart disease. Sexual minority men were more likelyto have a functional limitation. Regarding age-group dif-ferences, younger bisexual women were 44 % more likelyto be current alcohol consumers, and older lesbian and bi-sexual women were more likely than heterosexual womento be former drinkers and former cigarette smokers.Our study appears fairly consistent with prior studies.For instance, prior research has found that alcohol, to-bacco, and other drug use (as well as the morbidities as-sociated with these exposures) were higher amongsexual minorities than heterosexuals [21–26]. Thesestudies show that lesbians are more likely to be in recov-ery and to have been in treatment for alcohol use relatedproblems compared to heterosexual women [25]. Highrates of risk factors for heavy drinking and drinkingproblems – namely, childhood sexual abuse, depression,and suicidal ideation – among lesbians in other studiesmay explain the sexual orientation disparities in alcoholuse that we observed in our analysis [25]. Further, ameta-analysis found that sexual minorities across NorthAmerica and Europe were much more likely thanheterosexual individuals to experience anxiety, depres-sion, and suicidal ideation [27] as well as panic attacksand psychological distress [28], which may explainhigher rates of alcohol use and cigarette smoking amongsexual minority women, possibly to cope with stigma,discrimination, and stress. Lastly, it is possible thathigher rates of obesity among sexual minority womenmay be due to a higher prevalence of binge eating in thispopulation relative to heterosexual women, which hasbeen linked to minority stress [29].In this study, older gay men, younger bisexual men,and bisexual women were more likely than their hetero-sexual counterparts to report initiating HPV vaccination.Agénor et al. found that lesbians aged 15–25 years wereless likely to have initiated HPV vaccination relative totheir heterosexual counterparts [30]. The difference inthese study findings may be due to differences in studypopulation age. Although all sexual minorities (exceptyounger gay men) were more likely than heterosexualpersons to delay healthcare because of cost, we observedno sexual orientation identity disparities in health insur-ance status. In contrast, prior studies have found thatsexual minorities were less likely to have health insur-ance, have received a checkup within in the past year,and have unmet medical needs compared to their het-erosexual counterparts [9, 31]. A different study foundresults similar to ours for women but showed thathealthcare access among men in same-sex relationshipswas the same as or greater than among men inopposite-sex relationships [32]. However, this study useda different dimension of sexual orientation (i.e., genderof sexual partners vs. sexual orientation identity) thanour study, which may explain the disparate findings. Thedemographics of the participants in each study couldalso contribute to disparate findings. For instance, bothaffluent and impoverished sexual minorities are includedin our nationally representative sample and other studiesmay have had disproportionate representation from ei-ther group. Furthermore, although our study did notidentify any difference in sleep duration between sexualminority and heterosexual individuals, prior research hasfound evidence of shorter sleep duration among sexualminorities compared to their heterosexual counterparts[33].According to the minority stress model [34], experi-ences of stigma, discrimination, and victimization relatedto being a sexual minority may lead to a stress responsethat increases the risk of poor mental and physicalhealth outcomes among sexual minorities. Specific partsof the stress process linked to being a sexual minorityare believed to include expectations of rejection, sexualorientation identity masking, internalized homophobia,and coping by, for instance, attempting to decreaseminority stress through problem solving, expressingJackson et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:807 Page 9 of 11emotions, and using substances to cope [35]. Discrimin-ation may be a particularly important mechanism bywhich inequities related to being a sexual minority inU.S. society are related to suboptimal health among sex-ual minorities. For example, a prior study found that gayand bisexual individuals reported more experiences oflifetime and day-to-day discrimination than heterosexualindividuals, and approximately 42 % of sexual minoritiesattributed this, at least in part, to their sexual orienta-tion. Experiencing discrimination was positively associ-ated with poor quality of life and psychiatric morbidityin this study [36]. Further, interpersonal and institutionaldiscrimination based on sexual orientation identity alsocontributes to a lack of supportive social and health ser-vices for sexual minorities [37] and may help explainsexual orientation identity disparities in healthcare ac-cess and utilization among U.S. women and men. Fur-ther investigations of the influence of social contexts ornorms/mainstream culture on health disparities amongsexual minorities are needed.This study has several limitations. First, we used datafrom a cross-sectional survey that included only one di-mension of sexual orientation (i.e., sexual orientationidentity), although the relationship between sexualorientation and health may differ based on the measureof sexual orientation (e.g., sexual attraction, sex of sexualpartners) used. Sexuality is fluid and sexual orientationcategories are historically contingent. It is possible forparticipants to shift, for example, from the “somethingelse/don’t know” category to another category over time.Therefore, we need longitudinal studies to examinesexual orientation disparities over the lifecourse and his-torical time [38, 39]. Second, all data are based on self-report, and some estimates (e.g. BMI), therefore, may beconservative. Third, data on social stressors (e.g., stigma,discrimination) or stress responses were not available foranalysis in our study, although they are likely to partially,if not fully, mediate the relationship between sexualorientation identity and many of the health and health-care outcomes that we considered in this study. Papsmear testing among women was also unavailable.Fourth, there could also be differences in reporting ofhealth and healthcare experiences by sexual orientationidentity, which could bias our results; however, such dif-ferences have not been documented. Also, the two cat-egories we used to investigate age or cohort differenceswere broad due to sample size limitations, but it is im-portant to acknowledge that developmental and gener-ational differences exist especially among those aged 31through older than 85 years.This study also has important strengths. Specifically,our analyses used data from a large national probabilitysample of the U.S. population with very little missingdata. Therefore, we were able to robustly stratifyestimates of health and healthcare by sexual orientationidentity by both gender and age, which will help informfuture studies and evidence-based interventions that aretailored to the unique needs of sexual minorities withdifferent social, developmental, and health and health-care needs. We also present findings on understudiedaspects of gay and bisexual men’s health as well as re-sults pertaining to the health and healthcare of lesbianand bisexual women, for whom nationally representativedata are scarce [40].ConclusionsIn conclusion, sexual minorities had a higher prevalenceof some poor health behaviors and outcomes. In orderto help inform evidence-based programs and policiesthat promote the health and healthcare of sexual minor-ities, future research identifying the factors that may me-diate the relationship between sexual orientation identityand health behaviors, outcomes, and services use isneeded – including among U.S. women and men separ-ately given the complex interplay between sexual orien-tation and gender [41, 42]. Additionally, the interactionbetween other social factors (e.g., race/ethnicity, SEP)and sexual orientation identity should be investigated inorder to inform future health interventions that meetthe needs of diverse groups of sexual minorities – in-cluding those of color and those from low-income back-grounds, who remain understudied and underserved.AcknowledgementsNot applicable.FundingDr. Jackson was supported by the Harvard Catalyst Clinical and TranslationalScience Center (grant 1UL1 TR001102-07).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research shows that sexual minorities (e.g., lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals) experience higher levels of discrimination, stigma, and stress and are at higher risk of some poor health outcomes and health behaviors compared to their heterosexual counterparts. However, the majority of studies have examined sexual orientation disparities in a narrow range of health outcomes and behaviors using convenience samples comprised of either men or women living in restricted geographic areas. METHODS: To investigate the relationship between sexual orientation identity and health among U.S. women and men, we used Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate prevalence ratios for health behaviors, outcomes, and services use comparing sexual minorities to heterosexual individuals using 2013 and 2014 National Health Interview Survey data (N = 69,270). RESULTS: Three percent of the sample identified as sexual minorities. Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian (prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.65 [95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 2.37]) and bisexual (PR = 2.16 [1.46, 3.18]) women were more likely to report heavy drinking. Lesbians had a higher prevalence of obesity (PR = 1.20 [1.02, 1.42]), stroke (PR = 1.96 [1.14, 3.39]), and functional limitation (PR = 1.17 [1.02, 1.34] than heterosexual women. Gay men were more likely to have hypertension (PR = 1.21 [1.03, 1.43]) and heart disease (PR = 1.39 [1.02, 1.88]). Despite no difference in health insurance status, sexual minorities were more likely than heterosexual individuals to delay seeking healthcare because of cost; however, members of this group were also  more likely to have received an HIV test and initiated HPV vaccination. CONCLUSION: Sexual minorities had a higher prevalence of some poor health behaviors and outcomes",
