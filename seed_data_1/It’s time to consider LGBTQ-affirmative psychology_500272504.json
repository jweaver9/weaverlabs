E-mail: ktkhresearch@gmail.comIt’s Time to Consider LGBTQ-Affirmative Psychology in MalaysiaKyle K. H. Tan1AbstractInternational studies have revealed stark mental health inequities affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people. While there is increasing awareness of higher prevalence of mental health difficulties among LGBTQ people in Malaysia, this issue has often been viewed through a cisheterosexist (cisgenderism and heterosexism) lens that criminalizes, pathologizes, marginalizes, and/or delegitimizes noncisgender and nonheterosexual forms of identities. Informed by LGBTQ-affirmative psy-chology, this viewpoint aims to scrutinize the common misconceptions surrounding the living experiences of Malaysian LGBTQ people; these include poor mental health among LGBTQ people, victim-blaming narrative of sexual violence, LGBTQ is a mental illness, and LGBTQ is a Western influence. This viewpoint draws on empirical and theoretical research, as well as international guidelines, to debunk these misconceptions. Recommendations are also provided for psychology practitioners and researchers to embark on the journey to supporting Malaysian LGBTQ people in a culturally safe manner.KeywordsLGBT, LGBTQ, cisgenderism, heterosexism, MalaysiaJournal of Psychosexual Health1–6© The Author(s) 2021 Reprints and permissions:in.sagepub.com/journals-permissions-indiaDOI: 10.1177/26318318211060484journals.sagepub.com/home/sshIntroductionIn this viewpoint, I use the umbrella term “lesbian, gay, bisex-ual, transgender, and queer or LGBTQ” to refer to people whose sexual orientations and/or gender identities or expres-sions differ from the conventional social norms of being het-erosexual (people who are attracted to a different gender than their own) and cisgender (people whose gender corresponds to their sex assigned at birth). The multiethnic Malaysian LGBTQ population also encompasses people who adopt culture-specific LGBTQ identities such as mak nyah and tongzhi (同志) that carry intricate sociocultural meanings.1 Rather than merely equating these culture-specific terms with English definitions, a culturally appropriate lens should be used to affiliate these terms with historical (eg, reclaiming identities that have been long subjugated by colonizing cul-tures), political (eg, advocating for normalization of identities that have referred in a derogatory manner), and social (eg, connecting with other LGBTQ members who share similar identities) connotations.1 To date, no agencies (including the Department of Statistics) have examined the demography of LGBTQ people in Malaysia; so as a consequence, the preva-lence of this population is not known.Creative Commons Non Commercial CC BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-Commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage). This viewpoint aims to address common LGBTQ misconceptions in Malaysia and highlight the roles of psychologists (including practitioners and researchers) in improving the health and well-being of this marginalized population. In light of the surge in number of Malaysian research pathologizing the living experiences of LGBTQ people,2 this viewpoint draws on LGBTQ-affirmative psychology3 to challenge the societal bias, prejudice, and discrimination against people of diverse sexuality and gender. The LGBTQ psychology adopts an inclusive and interdisciplinary approach by working with LGBTQ psychologists and cisgender and heterosexual allies from psychology, sociology, law, public health (to name a few) to empower LGBTQ people who have been long affected by the historical, social, and legal contexts of marginalization. 2 Journal of Psychosexual HealthCisheterosexism in Malaysia: Debunking MisconceptionsTo date, jurisdictions that criminalize same-sex conducts, and gender identity and/or expression of transgender people, still exist in Malaysia. These comprise the federal legislation (ie, Section 377A of the Penal Code (Act 574)) that penalizes carnal intercourse “against the order of nature” such as anal sex in same-sex relationships, and Sharia laws that regulate normative expressions of sexuality and gender among Muslim.4 Criminalization of LGBTQ identities since British colonial rule has led to the rise of cisheterosexism among Malaysians.5 Derived from “cisgenderism” and “heterosex-ism”, the term “cisheterosexism” denotes prejudices that pathologize (perceive LGBTQ people as mentally disor-dered), marginalize (privilege cisgender and heterosexual people), and delegitimize (reinforce that sexuality and gender are binary concepts) noncisgender and nonheterosexual forms of expression, role, and identity.2 Cisheterosexism is evident across various levels of Malaysian LGBTQ people’s life, ranging from individual (internalization of negative societal attitudes toward one’s own LGTBQ identity), interpersonal (unfair treatment, rejection, and victimization), to institu-tional (discriminatory laws and noninclusive policies).6 Cisheterosexism is also prevalent in the field of psychology.7 It is concerning that psychologists who are in a position to contribute to improved well-being of marginalized groups and influence policies in institutional settings,8 may perpetuate cisheterosexism in their own practices. In a quali-tative study of 28 LGBTQ young people in Malaysia, partic-ipants reported distrust toward mental health professionals’ competency in LGBTQ care and avoidance of services due to fear of being stigmatized.9 Corroborating finding of low knowledge level on supporting LGBTQ clients was observed in a study that interviewed 15 Malaysian counsellors, and recommendations were made to provide specific education and guideline for counsellors for who are interested in deliv-ering LGBTQ-affirming services.10Below, I summarize 4 common misconceptions derived from Malaysian studies utilizing a cisheterosexist lens, and draw on local and international empirical evidence as a basis of argument. 1. LGBTQ people have poor mental health?  Through interviews with 6 Malaysian LGBTQ people, researchers from a study claimed that people with depression and anxiety are likely to identify as LGBTQ.11 To support their inference, the researchers cited statements from an Australian mental health organization, Beyond Blue, that reported elevated risks of depression, anxiety, and suicidality among LGBTQ people compared to those identifying as cisgender and heterosexual. Whilst it is an estab- lished fact that LGBTQ people experience mental health inequities, there is a need to understand the antecedents of mental health difficulties as related to cisheterosexism.12   Cited by more than 10,500 times to date (source: Google Scholar; October 2021), Meyer’s minority stress theory13 posits that LGBTQ people encounter minority stress due to their marginalized social position. Minority stressors may manifest as stigma and discrimination, which are not experienced by those in privileged position (ie, cisgender and heterosexual people), and can have specific negative effects on the mental health of LGBTQ people. Recently, psychology scholars have expanded on the utility Meyer’s theory by positioning cisheterosexism as the origin of minority stress14 and incorporating a biopsychosocial framework15 to examine the adverse biological effects (eg, sleep disturbance and immune dysregulation) resulting from minority stress. Although no Malaysian studies to date have examined mental health effects of minority stress of LGBTQ people, a large-scale quantitative study in Singapore (which share similar sociocultural context with Malaysia) has revealed a strong association between discrimination based on LGBTQ identities and suicidal ideation.16 With the overwhelming evidence demonstrating negative mental health effects of cisheterosexism, it is crucial for psychologists to be prudent when seeing LGBTQ clients and recognize that minority stress is one of the contributors for mental distress.  A culturally competent psychologist involves being cognizant of the social marginalization context of Malaysian LGBTQ people. Hence, the association of poor mental health and LGBTQ identities should be understood based on existing models of mental health difficulties related to cisheterosexism.13-15 2. Childhood sexual violence leads to LGBTQ?  Based on a quote extracted from gay participant on his high libido and childhood sexual victimization experience, a Malaysian study of 5 LGBTQ participants insinuated that childhood sexual victimization is a factor for people identifying as LGBTQ.17 Not only that the conclusion drawn was highly premature, the researchers also wrote in a language that could be construed as victim-blaming (ie, suggesting LGBTQ people are at fault for the sexual harm that befalls them). Further scrutiny of that particular study found that there was no approval granted from an ethics committee nor was carried out in consultation with any LGBTQ groups in Malaysia.15 On the other hand, another Malaysian qualitative study of 33 gay men reported that participants commonly described homosexuality as inherent (nature) and that interpersonal (eg, friends and family members) and institutional (eg, school environments) factors (nurture) play crucial roles in healthy development of LGBTQ identities.18 International population-based estimate Tan 3indicates that the LGBTQ population is a diverse entity with increasing number of people situating their identities across spectrums of sexuality and gender diversity. For instance, a national probability survey of transgender people reported a higher percentage of young people identifying as nonbinary (including genderfluid and genderqueer) and those of older age groups were more likely to use binary transgender identities (trans man and trans woman).19 Therefore, a narrow conceptualization of sexuality and gender, especially from a cisheterosexist perspective, is likely to lose its applicability over the years.   It is not uncommon to come across victim-blaming narratives around LGBTQ people in Malaysia. Psychologists should be provided with LGBTQ-affirmative resources and trainings to improve our ability to discern evidence-informed LGBTQ research from those that attempt to blame LGBTQ people for their experiences of sexual violence.3. LGBTQ is a mental illness that should be curbed?   Lack of interventions from parents, religious authorities, and educational institutions have also been cited as reasons underlying the proliferation of Malaysian people identifying as LGBTQ.11,17 However, the notion that LGBTQ identities are pathological and ought to be rectified stands in contrast with LGBTQ-affirming approaches that support LGBTQ people in developing a positive sense of self. Efforts to revert LGBTQ people’s sexual orientation and/or gender through religious counseling, aversion therapy, and other methods that hinder LGBTQ people from taking medical and social steps to affirm their identities, are commonly known as “conversion therapy.”20,21 International studies with large samples of LGBTQ people have uncovered the association between exposure to conversion efforts and heightened risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts,20,21 providing empirical evidence that conversion efforts may cause mental distress and psychosocial morbidity. Some of the most crucial domains of social support with known protective influences on LGBTQ people’s mental health are family members, friends, and significant others that can include people from LGBTQ and religious communities.12 International LGBTQ research also found those surrounded by supportive social networks were less likely to be affected by minority stress and cisheterosexism.14 All psychologists have the ethical responsibility to promote the mental health and well-being of marginalized groups (including LGBTQ people),8 and we should critically scrutinize research that seeks to cause harm. In this instance, psychologists should question the moral intent of researchers who urged those in close social ties of LGBTQ people to perform conversion efforts which have little scientific credibility in altering sexuality and gender.  Internalized cisheterosexism (also sometimes known as internalized homo/transphobia) is the feeling of self-hatred and shame that some LGBTQ people may develop within themselves following the negative societal attitudes.13,14 Negative self-perception of LGBTQ identity should not be muddled with LGBTQ people being confused with their identities, although some do continue to question and explore their sexuality and gender across lifetime.3 The level of LGBTQ-inclusiveness that a country portrays, plays a key role in determining LGBTQ people’s self-acceptance toward their identities. Also evident in a cross-cultural quantitative study of gay men in Australia and Malaysia, the researchers found that the latter group had a higher level of internalized homophobia.22 This finding is perhaps unsurprising, given that Australia has legalized same-sex marriages and banned conversion practices in certain states, whereas these privileges were not enjoyed by Malaysian LGBTQ people. For researchers suggesting that LGBTQ people may wish to “return to normal life” due to internalized cisheterosexism,11 psychologists should reflect on minority stress theory that elucidates internationalized cisheterosexism as a proximal stressor arising from distal stressors (eg, societal rejection of LGBTQ identity).  Historically, LGBTQ people have been medicalized through Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) and International Classification of Disease (ICD) which are diagnostic tools widely used by professionals in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. Homosexuality is no longer listed as a mental disorder in the latest version of DSM-5 and ICD-11.23,24 The American Psychiatric Association made a symbolic change to replace “gender identity disorder” in DSM-IV with “gender dysphoria” in DSM-5 to shift away from the framing of transgender identity as a mental disorder.23 In attempts to dissociate transgender people with mental disorders, the World Health Organization moved the ICD-11’s classification of “gender incongruence” for transgender people from the “Mental and Behavioural Disorders” chapter to the new chapter of “Conditions Related to Sexual Health.24 Overseas psychology bodies such as the American Psychological Association and the New Zealand Psychological Society have also published statements asserting that identifying as LGBTQ is not a form of mental illness.25   The misconception that LGBTQ phenomenon can be mitigated through conversion efforts from peers, parents, and religious leaders does not align with the latest guideline provided by international bodies such as the American Psychiatric Association and the World Health Organization.23,24 Part of the role of a psychologist is to actively update ourselves with the 4 Journal of Psychosexual Healthlatest evidence-based guideline, and these include challenging pathologizing narratives around LGBTQ (eg, suggest that LGBTQ can be cured) and providing services that recognize the self-determination of LGBTQ people in identifying their own health needs.4. LGBTQ is merely a Western influence?  A few research has suggested that LGBTQ is a Western influence that has little relevance to the Muslim-majority Malaysian context.11,17 The claim that LGBTQ is only a recent phenomenon in Malaysia was refuted by early Malaysian research that pointed out that LGBTQ people have had a long history of residing in Malaysia. In fact, there was a period (before 1983) when transgender people were presented options to undertake gender-affirming surgeries in Malaysia without a repercussion of being detained.26 It should be noted that this viewpoint has no attempt in undermining the freedom for Malaysians to practice preferred religions, although religious practices should not be used as a medium to justify cisheterosexism and persecute LGBTQ people.27 International Human Rights Standards, such as the Yogyakarta Principles, acknowledges that all individuals have the basic right to freedom from criminalization and sanction regardless of their sexual orientation, gender, and sex characteristics (Principle 33).27 On this basis, all Malaysian LGBTQ people should be provided opportunities to flourish which include adequate access to social determinants (eg, LGBTQ-competent health care) through an equity lens.2 A scholar proposed that current laws criminalizing Malaysian LGBTQ people stem from intersecting religious, historical, and political imperatives; the multitude layer of influences perhaps explains the slow progress made in the LGBTQ decriminalizing movement in this country.28   Often, the Malaysian public is sensitized to the deleterious Western influence in promoting LGBTQ-affirmative practices by disrupting traditional family values and religious teachings. This misconception ought to be contested as it reinforces a cisheterosexist framework of understanding sexuality and gender and risks further stigmatizing the human rights of LGBTQ people who constitute an already marginalized population in Malaysia.Implications for PsychologistsGenerally, Malaysians have a low acceptance level toward LGBTQ people, with one nationally representative study reporting that 60.5% thought same-sex attraction was not morally justifiable.5 As aforementioned, negative attitude toward LGBTQ people stems from cisheterosexism that criminalizes (through both secular and religious laws), mar-ginalizes, pathologizes, and delegitimizes noncisgender and nonheterosexual forms of identities. There are currently a low number of LGBTQ-affirmative psychologists in Malaysia,10 and it is more important than ever to upskill psychologists in the area of LGBTQ-cultural safety and competence to respond to the increasing mental health needs among the Malaysian LGBTQ population due to cisheterosexism and the resultant minority stress. Cultural safety expands beyond culturally competence that requires psychologists to have basic knowl-edge in delivering LGBTQ-affirmative care (eg, working with the input of LGBTQ people to identify their health needs), and include an ongoing self-reflection that questions power structures related to their own culture, prejudice, and privilege that may affect quality of care.29 In the Malaysian context, this means psychologists should be aware of how their personal assumption is shaped by cisheterosexism and how power differential between provider and patient can dis-empower LGBTQ people from seeking timely and appropri-ate care.9The widespread cisheterosexism across various Malaysian institutions has, however, presented immense chal-lenges for psychologists to meet the goal of being culturally safe and competent when providing care for LGBTQ people. As a researcher endorsing LGBTQ-affirmative psychology, I can understand the hesitancy for Malaysian psychologists to take a similar stance in their own practices with LGBTQ clients. In no way I am pressuring psychologists to put their careers at stake for voicing out for the marginalized LGBTQ population. Rather, I encourage psychologists to work closely with local LGBTQ community organizations to identify best practices when interacting with LGBTQ clients and provide referral to other LGBTQ-competent specialists where neces-sary. With the increasing cisheterosexist attitudes toward Malaysian LGBTQ people, some LGBTQ organizations have emerged to provide a counternarrative that affirms the lived experiences of LGBTQ people.2 For instance, the SEED foun-dation (a transgender-led organization) has collaborated with the Galen Centre (an independent advocacy organization) to create a guideline for health professionals in the provision of trans-specific primary care in Malaysia.30 Meanwhile, it is fine for psychologists to not know everything about LGBTQ issues, as long as we maintain an open-minded attitude to learn about the health needs of LGBTQ people and foster a culturally safe relationship with LGBTQ clients.Final NoteNews of authorities targeting LGBTQ people and activists are not uncommon in Malaysia. In 2021, Nur Sajat, a Malaysian trans woman entrepreneur was charged under Syariah laws for dressing as a woman at a religious event.31 The Nur Sajat’s case, followed by various state authorities escalating restriction on LGBTQ people, exemplifies the repressive climate based on cisheterosexism which has spurred much fear among LGBTQ people to express their identities openly in Malaysia. However, there are also exam-ples of significant progress in combating persecution of the Tan 5LGBTQ community such as the overturning of the ruling of “sex against the order of nature” on a Muslim gay man.32Cisheterosexism that includes criminalization of LGBTQ identities has detrimental effects on LGBTQ people’s mental health. A recent review of existing Malaysian studies with LGBTQ people reported limited research focusing on mental health and well-being of this population.2 Specifically, critical literature gaps exist on the prevalence of mental health diffi-culties and the negative mental health impacts of minority stress on Malaysian LGBTQ people. More contextually rele-vant research on this topic is required so that we can advo-cate for change at the local level. Psychologists should be prepared to support graduate students (especially those who identify as LGBTQ) who express interest in researching on LGBTQ health. This includes helping students to understand the effects of cisheterosexism on LGBTQ people’s mental health and encouraging students to work in consultation with LGBTQ community organizations. At times, there will be voices that deter Malaysian researchers from exploring LGBTQ health with claims of potential backlashes from anti-LGBTQ groups or little changes that can be made to improve situation for LGBTQ people in Malaysia. My counterargu-ments for these sentiments are: If not now, then when?AcknowledgmentsThe author would like to thank allies who have been advancing equi-ty for the Malaysian LGBTQ population, including Chin Sheng who has inspired me to write this viewpoint.Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.FundingThe author received no financial support for the research, author-ship, and/or publication of this article.ORCID iDKyle K.
