SummaryIntroduction In 2010, ARL published SPEC Kit 319 Diversity Plans and Programs, which provided a glimpse into the progress ARL member libraries had made to recruit and retain a diverse workforce since 1990 and explored the existence and content of diversity plans and programs. The results of that SPEC survey, when compared with the results of the 1990 surveys for SPEC Kit 165 Cultural Diversity Programming in ARL Libraries and SPEC Kit 167 Minority Recruitment and Retention in ARL Libraries, showed that library activities in this area have been constantly in flux. Many of the libraries that responded to those surveys were leaders in the field of diversity and the three documents provide a wealth of information about library programs and services, recruitment and retention, and managing and retaining a diverse workforce.Today, diversity is defined beyond racial and ethnic groups and includes gender, sexual orientation, ability, language, religious belief, national origin, age, and ideas. The increase of published literature about cultural competencies, microaggressions, and assessment of diversity issues, as well as the inclusion of social justice movements in libraries, suggests diversity-related activities have increased and evolved over the last seven years. Over this time span, several libraries have obtained funding to support strategies to increase the number of minority librarians on their staff and support their advancement within the organization. There also appears to be an increase in the number of diversity or multicultural groups at the local, state, and national levels. However, these changes have not been consistently documented. Therefore, it is important to re-examine this topic to evaluate the impact of evolving endeavors, to see if more ARL libraries are involved, to see how diversity plans have changed over the years, and to document the current practices of research libraries.The main purpose of this survey was to identify diversity trends and changes in managing diversity issues in ARL libraries through exploring the components of diversity plans and initiatives since 2010, acknowledge library efforts since the 1990s, provide evidence of best practices and future trends, and identify current strategies that increase the number of minority librarians in research libraries and the types of programs that foster a diverse workplace and climate. The survey was conducted between May 1 and June 5, 2017. Sixty-eight of the 124 ARL member institutions responded to the survey for a 55% response rate. Interestingly, only 22 of the respondents to the 2010 SPEC survey participated in this survey, but this provides an opportunity to explore the diversity and inclusion efforts of a new set of institutions in addition to seeing what changes those 22 institutions have made since 2010.3SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionDiversity/Inclusion Plans A diversity/inclusion plan may include a statement of diversity values or goals for the library, a description of strategies for recruiting ethnically/culturally diverse staff to the library and retaining them once they are hired, an outline of programs that promote ethnic/cultural sensitivity in the workplace, results from a workplace climate assessment, and other similar elements. It may be a stand-alone document or part of a broader document, such as a library strategic plan or an institution-wide diversity document. Similar to the 2010 survey, 36 of the responding libraries (53%) reported they have a diversity plan as described above; an additional 14 (21%) have a plan currently under development or review. The majority of plans are separate documents spread throughout the institution that, when joined together, form what can be defined as a diversity/inclusion plan. Several other respondents mentioned they do not have specific plans but that statements on diversity and inclusion are included in library strategic plans and in the library committee structure. Elements of the diversity plan remain the same, however newer elements such as climate survey, measuring success,  and information about accountability are included.The majority of respondents who have a plan reported that their library administration was responsible for initiating its development (24 or 67%). At seven of those libraries (19%) the library human resources officer/unit also played a role. Forty-one respondents (87%) reported that diversity initiatives or directives from their parent institution had an impact on the library plan. Survey respondents’ comments suggest that outside factors such as social justice movements and the creation of campus offices for diversity and inclusion were the main drivers of these changes, as were campus leaders invested in diversity and inclusion leadership positions and departments. One respondent mentioned that the development of their plan was “truly a grassroots effort by staff that was supported by administration.”A closer look at the diversity plans initiated by parent institutions reveals that some are a part of the campus strategic planning document that outlines specific initiatives and includes components of responsibility and accountability. Some of the examples are statements about diversity & inclusion from high-level campus administration such as the provost, chancellor, or president. Other institutions have  provided training on implicit bias, conducted a climate survey, or appointed committees and charged groups to work in this area. There is a clear increase in the ways libraries and campuses are looking at and approaching these issues.One significant change since 2010 is the number of libraries that review their plans annually and biannually; 24 of 34 responding libraries reported their diversity and inclusion plans were updated as recently as 2015 or are currently being evaluated. While 18 respondents stated their plans are components of the strategic planning process in the libraries or in the parent organization, more than half of the diversity plans (24 or 57%) were reported as stand-alone documents.An important aspect of having a plan is the ability to implement it, including staff to plan and deliver programming and training in support of those efforts. In 2010, 36 respondents reported a total of three multicultural librarians and seven diversity officers. Responses to the 2017 survey show an increase: seven libraries report having a multicultural/diversity librarian and 20 have diversity officers. Currently, implementation of diversity and inclusion plans falls primarily on diversity committees or other related groups (32 of 42 respondents or 76%), HR/personnel officers (27 or 64%), or diversity officers (15 or 36%). Several reported that library administrators also play a role. One respondent reported, “The Libraries made it a requirement for all faculty and staff to have a diversity commitment statement in their position description.” This sentiment is shared by other libraries who also reported that the responsibility for diversity and inclusion falls on all members of the organization.                       4 Survey Results: Executive SummaryFunding Strategies Responses to a question about whether the library has dedicated funding to support diversity/inclusion efforts were split fairly evenly between libraries who reported they do (35 or 52%) and those who do not (32 or 48%). Thirty-four of the respondents who have dedicated funding said the source is the general library budget. Twelve of these also receive support from the parent institution. Eight libraries supplement their primary funding with federal, state, and/or private grants. One receives funding solely from the parent institution. Several respondents commented that the dean has a discretionary fund from which resources can be requested. The majority of respondents reported that funding supports professional development, workshops, program development, leadership development, recruitment efforts, and travel. Comments about other activities reflect support for residency programs that increase the number of diverse staff. At 16 libraries the level of funding has increased over the last five years; at 17 it has stayed about the same. Only two respondents said that funding has decreased.Programs to Promote an Inclusive WorkplaceThe majority of respondents use a variety of staff development strategies to promote an inclusive workplace. These include presentations, workshops, programs, and exhibits, as well as specialized efforts that focus on adding diverse general, special, and online resources to library collections. Examples of these efforts include training on conflict management, implicit bias, microaggressions, cultural and gender identity, and safe zones; book talks and poster sessions; exhibits for K–8 students; and travel support for diversity conferences.These efforts are planned and delivered by a wide variety of individuals and groups, most often by a library diversity committee or similar group and/or a personnel officer. Forty-four libraries responded that other individuals and/or groups are also involved with planning or delivering diversity programs, including departments, units, other committees and working groups, branch libraries, subject specialists, and museum staff. Widespread programming is taking place at the staff, librarian, and library administration levels. Collaborations with campus partners and community activists also strengthen the types of programs offered. Almost all of the responding libraries are taking advantage of training opportunities provided by the parent institution and many send staff to training provided by professional organizations such as ALA, ACRL, and ARL.When asked about use of the 2012 ACRL Diversity Standards, 50 respondents (77%) reported they have not used them in any way. Those who had, mostly used them as a reference in the creation of their own institution’s diversity plan.Recruitment Strategies All but seven of the 68 responding libraries have or plan to develop recruitment strategies to increase ethnically/culturally diverse applicant pools. Many of the strategies are not new, but the most successful ones include training search committee members on how to develop a diverse candidate pool, targeting job ads to participants of diversity enhancement recruitment programs such as ARL’s Initiative to Recruit a Diverse Workforce (IRDW) and ALA’s Spectrum Scholars program, offering a post-LIS residency program, and supporting ARL initiatives that attract librarians from racially and ethnically diverse groups to the profession.There is about an equal split between libraries that feel their strategies have led to pools that are more inclusive (53% ) and those that do not (47%). Comments revealed there is little data to support these feelings because the information either isn’t tracked or lies in the hands of the parent institute and is not shared with library search committees. One respondent noted that the diversity of their pools increased after implementing an initiative that gives applicants extra credit for military service, since “veterans tend to be a diverse group.”5SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionReal and perceived barriers to recruitment were reported by a majority of the respondents (37 or 63%), a number that has increased since 2010. The most common barriers continue to be related to the library’s geographic location and the reputation of the city, state, or university as not welcoming diverse individuals. Others mentioned the small pools of diverse candidates in LIS programs and implicit bias of search committees or managers. These are very similar to the challenges expressed by respondents to the survey for SPEC Kit 319. Libraries are trying to overcome these barriers by adding more inclusive statements to their job announcement, direct contact with diverse candidates,  and providing implicit bias training to search committees.Retention Programs Going hand in hand with recruitment is retention of staff. Forty-eight of the responding libraries (71%) have developed strategies for retaining a diverse group of employees. The most used strategies are onboarding/orientation programs for new staff, leadership development and training, mentoring programs to help librarians attain advancement and/or tenure, and supporting membership in or engagement with parent institution diversity affinity groups or ALA ethnic caucuses. Other strategies revealed in the comments are the development of writing groups for all of the faculty, travel funds for all library personnel, personal involvement and advocacy by library leadership, and library administrators who actively work to ensure a positive work culture. Two respondents commented that their library has become a member of the ACRL Diversity Alliance. Of these options, leadership development, mentoring, supporting engagement with parent institution groups, and residency programs have been the most successful. One commenter summed up their experience with retention success: “having a diverse staff helps retain a diverse staff.”Ten respondents reported that the library has made changes that have improved retention outcomes. Examples include developing or redesigning a residency program, requiring that all new staff attend the orientation program, supporting writing groups, and having all staff identify diversity learning goals during the annual performance review process. Still, about half of the respondents have encountered obstacles to retaining a diverse group of employees. Through exit interviews some libraries learned that librarians left institutions because of limited advancement options, the lack of connection with staff, and the culture of the university. The lack of diversity in the local community is also an issue. Others report that salaries aren’t competitive or they haven’t even had the funds to fill vacancies. More recently, the political climate in certain states is perceived to have negatively impacted the retention of diverse library staff.Evaluation & AssessmentEvaluation and assessment of recruitment and retention efforts continue to challenge the majority of libraries. Only ten respondents have developed ways to measure recruitment success in their libraries. Another 25 plan to develop such measures in the future. Eight libraries measure the success of their retention efforts and 20 others plan to. Workplace climate assessment is more common, though, perhaps because survey tools already exist. Forty-six libraries (68%) have assessed their workplace climate and an additional 12 (8%) are planning to. Twenty-four (48%) have or will use surveys developed by their parent institution.  Nineteen (38%) have or will use surveys developed by the library and 19 libraries use the ClimateQUAL™ survey. Ten libraries have used multiple surveys to gage their climate. Since these efforts are not yet well established, it is not surprising that only 19 libraries have used assessment results to change their diversity plan and/or programming, though 60 respondents described recent changes to their diversity/inclusion initiatives.6 Survey Results: Executive SummaryDiversity & Inclusion EngagementOver the last five years, changes in the national political climate, as well as changes in campus and library leadership, have greatly influenced and heightened awareness of diversity and inclusion activities at survey respondents’ institutions. Many stated that the quantity and depth of diversity activities and trainings have increased, including increased engagement by more faculty and staff so “diversity and inclusion is woven into the fabric of all we do and less as stand-alone initiatives.” The development of strategic plans—both at the campus and library level—with built-in support services has also enabled libraries to respond to social justice movements in a variety of ways, from hosting exhibits, providing space for peaceful gathering, and partnering with campus cultural affinity groups to formal inclusion statements and moves to de-name/rename buildings. Several respondents also mentioned the transformation of gendered restrooms into gender-neutral restrooms.Recommendations and ConclusionIn the seven years since SPEC Kit 319 surveyed ARL member libraries on their diversity plans and programs, they have made strides to create more diverse and inclusive workplaces by developing both library and institution-level diversity committees, teams, and task forces, diversity officer positions, and specific diversity and inclusion plans. While it is clear that ARL libraries have expanded their definition and scope of diversity and the methods they use to support marginalized groups, there is more to be done, not only at an institutional level but in the profession as a whole.Recruiting librarians from underrepresented groups to the profession has to begin with LIS education. Innovative approaches that fund opportunities in archives, music, and other internships are attracting undergraduate students who may become interested in a library career. Changes to the graduate-level LIS curriculum that incorporate cultural competencies and social justice issues can ensure students will learn how best to serve diverse communities through collections, programs, and services. For example, Jaeger and his colleagues (2015) have been successful in developing the “virtuous circle” of educating LIS faculty and students to be compassionate and culturally responsive to the needs of the community, therefore recruiting other individuals who share their values into the profession. Cooke (2017) has incorporated discussions and projects into her classes that challenge the students to be responsive to and value the communities they may work in and desire to serve.LIS students have also organized diversity initiatives on their campuses. For example, the iDiversity group at the University of Maryland was organized in 2012 to promote cultural competency within the institution and the profession at large (Oxley 2016). In response to call for a greater sense of community amongst graduate students of color at the Simmons School of Library and Information Sciences, Students of Color at SLIS was founded in 2015 to build and sustain a supportive community to contribute to their academic development, social growth, and well being. Spectra was formed to bring together individuals who share an interest in issues that surround the LGBTQ community in the profession of library science. In 2016, DERAIL (Diversity, Equity, Race, Accessibility, and Identity in LIS), a student-initiated forum for students to engage in meaningful conversations about critical approaches to librarianship, archives, children’s literature, cultural heritage institutions, and museums, held its first forum. (Simmons College n.d.)Libraries must continue to fund and implement library programs that research and experience show really work: mentoring, residency programs, professional development, affinity groups, and staff training. Damasco and Hodges’ research (2012) about the tenure and promotion experiences of academic librarians identified obstacles and effective initiatives in achieving success. Their results reinforce the need for informal and formal mentoring, professional development programs, and affinity or peer support groups for successful advancement. The results of this SPEC survey also show that mentoring programs, both formal and informal, are successful in retaining a diverse workforce, but are still slow in developing.7SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionPlacing early and mid-career librarians in positions where they can hone their skills and gain experiences for future positions is also beneficial. Boyd, et al. (2017 ) surveyed active and inactive residency coordinators and residents to evaluate academic library residency programs for librarians of color. Their research found those programs provide skills and experiences for beginning career librarians and are evidence of organizational effectiveness. The ACRL Diversity Alliance has attracted 33 libraries, including ARL members, that will continue “to increase the pipeline of professionally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups” by creating one or more residency positions that last two to three years. Since 1997, 150 mid-career librarians from traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups have participated in the ARL Leadership and Career Development Program (LCDP). When Washington-Hoagland and Puente (2016) surveyed LCDP alumni to assess the impact of the program, she found that 76% experienced an advance in their position during or soon after their 18-month fellowship.In 2015, Alabi designed a survey, open to all academic librarians, to identify racial microaggressions witnessed by majority librarians or experienced by librarians of color. Alabi’s research exposed the subtle statements, actions, and nonverbals that disrespect individual library patrons and staff. Increased awareness of these hidden nonverbal behaviors and actions, as well as implicit bias, privilege, etc., compels libraries to train staff because unchecked behaviors negatively influence workplace climate.With the evolution of social media and networking, the landscape is more engaging and proactive in changing expectations about discovery of diversity and inclusion tools. New conferences, innovative project, rallying points, and strategic directions have been unlocked across the nation and around the world. Social network-connected librarians are ready to make a difference in their organizations. For example, April Hathcock (2015) published her article about white privilege and the effectiveness of diversity and inclusion efforts in the open access journal In the Library with the Lead Pipe. Within hours, and for several weeks, librarians joined the scholarly discourse by adding their thoughts on and experiences with the effectiveness of diversity and inclusion initiatives.In the new and revived era of social movements and rallies, there is a need for more conversations, openness, and understanding about diversity, inclusion, equity, and privilege. To fully encompass the various levels of social identities, efforts have evolved beyond just the racial and ethnic diversity demonstrated by the varied efforts reported in this survey. Political climate has also fueled the discourse about equity and privilege through grassroot efforts. Persistence has led the charge to stay engaged and vocal about the efforts of unrepresented and underrepresented librarians.Ongoing assessment is needed to evaluate and measure the success both of programs and individuals in diversity-focused positions. Libraries have access to assessment tools such as ClimateQUAL™ and the Balanced Scorecard that were designed to measure success within institutional strategic planning goals. With recent changes in implementing diversity and inclusion at the parent institution level, they may need to draw on the strengths of consultants to determine successful efforts and help them develop effective assessment and evaluation tools.In conclusion, research institutions are cultivating learning environments that are inclusive of all of the attributes that make us different and unique. Libraries are at the center of these institutions and are demonstrating their value through their engagement in research and instruction, collections, and learning spaces. Diversity and inclusion themes permeate all of these areas. There is evidence that some libraries are incorporating their values for inclusion at all levels. While inclusive practice supports the diverse individual to be themselves and be perceived as valued in the organization, moving to the next level is vital to avoid the exclusion of these individuals in the everyday rituals in the workplace, which impacts climate issues and retention. (Mor Barak 2015; Shore, et al. 2017)8 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesSurvey Questions and ResponsesThe SPEC Survey on Diversity and Inclusion was designed by Toni Anaya, Instruction Coordinator, and Charlene Maxey-Harris, Research and Instructional Services Chair, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These results are based on responses from 68 of the 124 ARL member libraries (55%) by the deadline of June 12, 2017. The survey’s introductory text and questions are reproduced below, followed by the response data and selected comments from the respondents.Since the SPEC survey program began in the early 1970s, at least six surveys have investigated how research libraries responded to affirmative action initiatives, recruited minorities, and, more recently, attempted to build an inclusive workforce that reflects the broad diversity of their communities. The resulting SPEC Kits provide a wealth of information about library hiring programs and services, recruitment and retention strategies, and efforts to foster diversity with the workforce. They also show that the issues have been in constant flux. While the focus of earlier surveys was on how successful libraries have been in recruiting and retaining librarians of color, the characteristics of diversity now extend beyond racial and ethnic groups to include gender, sexual orientation, ability, language, religious belief, national origin, age, and ideas.The increase of published literature about cultural competencies, microaggressions, and assessment of diversity issues, as well as the inclusion of social justice movements in libraries, suggests diversity-related activities have increased and evolved since 2010, when ARL published SPEC Kit 319 Diversity Plans and Programs. During the last seven years, several libraries have obtained funding to support strategies to increase the number of minority librarians on their staff and support their advancement within the organization. There also appears to be an increase in the number of diversity and inclusion or social justice committees, task forces, and project teams at the local, state, and national levels. In addition, libraries and archives are evaluating the extent to which collection development strategies, exhibitions, descriptive practices, student and community outreach activities, and other activity can support the creation of inclusive environments. However, these changes have not been consistently documented. Therefore, it is important to re-examine research libraries’ efforts to create a more representative workforce and inclusive work environment.The purpose of this survey is to explore the components of diversity plans created since 2010, identify current recruitment and retention strategies that aim to increase the number of minority librarians in research libraries, identify staff development programs that foster an inclusive workplace and climate, identify how diversity programs have changed, and gather information on how libraries assess these efforts. 9SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionDIVERSITY PLANA diversity/inclusion plan may include a statement of diversity values or goals for the library, a description of strategies for recruiting diverse staff from historically underrepresented or marginalized groups to the library and retaining them once they are hired, an outline of programs that promote ethnic/cultural sensitivity in the workplace, results from a work climate assessment, and similar elements. It may be a stand-alone document or part of a broader document, such as a library strategic plan or an institution-wide diversity document.1. Does your library have a diversity/inclusion plan as described above? N=68Yes 36 53%Not yet, but one is being developed 14 21%No 18 27%Comments N=24Answered Yes N=14Diversity and inclusion is represented in the library’s committee structure and in the strategic plan.Each year, an overview of the accomplishments from our plan are reflected on our website. Has not been formally updated since 2010. Here is ours: The UC San Diego Library is committed to nurturing and maintaining a supportive and inclusive environment in which diversity and fairness are valued and respected. This commitment builds on the UC San Diego Principles of Community, reaffirmed regularly by the Chancellor, which provide a framework for diversity, fairness, and inclusion on campus and place a high value on the unique contributions of each member of the UC San Diego community. The Library Diversity & Inclusion Committee works to build, foster, and maintain a climate that respects: equal access and participation of all groups and individuals, regardless of their culture, race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or geographic origin. To accomplish this, the committee members collaborate with Library staff, students, and campus partners to develop, advise, and implement various programs and processes. The Library Diversity & Inclusion Committee activities include: Working with members of the Library Administration and Library Council to articulate the Library’s expectations of its staff for cultural competence, in keeping with the University of California Diversity Statement (University of California Diversity Statement); Working with the Library’s Training Coordinator to provide diversity-related educational opportunities for Library staff; Creating opportunities and venues for discussion of diversity/equity issues within the Library; Advising Library Administration and Library Council members on policy issues related to diversity and inclusion; Forming partnerships and sharing information and best practices with relevant groups on campus, including the Diversity Council, student groups, and others as appropriate; Collaborating with various Library programs to support and celebrate diversity and inclusion activities.Our statement: The University of Texas Libraries welcomes and respects all individuals and communities by valuing and consciously maintaining awareness of diverse perspectives and experiences. We believe inclusivity is critical to fostering excellence in all of our endeavors, and we promote diversity in our collections and the services that we provide as well as in our recruiting, hiring and retention practices. Our university has an institution-wide document. 10 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesPrepared at the request of a campus-wide diversity initiative.The University Library has a diversity strategic plan. The initial plan was formulated in 2011 and has been revised twice since then. The strategic goals have also been incorporated into the library’s strategic initiatives.These are separate documents, not a cohesive diversity plan. They include a library staff vision plan, the library strategic plan, and inclusion statement.University-wide series of documentsWe do not have a single document as described, but we do have most of the elements in place.We had a Diversity Task Force who put together a report and recommendations. We now have an Equity and Diversity Committee and subcommittees implementing the recommendations of the task force. One of the subcommittees of the EDC is a Strategic Diversity Task Force, which will look at building an ongoing plan. We have a plan that is part of our Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) workgroup and one that is part of our libraries’ strategic priorities and an overarching plan set forth by the university. We have had one for five years. In the process of updating and rewriting.Answered Not Yet N=5A statement about a commitment to diversity is included in the library’s strategic plan. Draft plan created in 2005 but wasn’t formalized; we are looking to develop a new one.Preliminary document is under review.We have an older plan that has not been updated substantially since 2008 or 2009. A 2012 revision of the libraries’ strategic plan also provides direction for diversity efforts. While we have a diversity committee and our libraries’ strategic plan includes commitment to diversity, we do not have an articulated diversity inclusion plan.Answered No N=5Our most recent strategic plan for the University Libraries (2016–2019) includes a paragraph of continuing education for employees, including “education that advances the development of an inclusive and diverse community.” Our parent institution has a diversity strategic plan (2013–2018) and a general strategic plan with a goal to “foster a diverse and inclusive community that supports mutual respect.” This work is primarily reflected in the charter of the University Libraries Diversity Council, a standing group that reports to the dean of libraries. Beyond “fostering a diverse and inclusive community,” none of our guiding documents outline specific plans, goals, or programs for this work.The Libraries has an affirmative action plan, which is administered by the university’s Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity (OIED). The university has recently appointed a new vice provost for this area who will likely develop a broader plan, at which time the Libraries will participate. There are pieces of plan spread across the strategic plan, our ClimateQUAL survey and results, and university diversity/inclusion statements. This idea is under consideration for development, but it’s not yet an active plan.Until 2015, each university unit prepared a document titled “A Framework to Foster Diversity” similar to what is described above. In 2015 a university-wide decision to integrate diversity planning into strategic planning was made reflecting our value that diversity is not a stand-alone item, but relates to everything we do.11SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionDIVERSITY PLAN DETAILSIf the library is developing a diversity/inclusion plan, please answer as many of the following questions as possible at this time.2.

In the last five years, has your parent institution developed diversity initiatives or issued directives that have impacted your library diversity plan? N=47Yes 41 87% No 6 13% If yes, please briefly describe those initiatives/directives and how they impacted the library plan. N=38A new strategic plan was developed that specifically included diversity initiatives. Campus created a Diversity Framework, which included framework goals. They then created a R.E.E.L change model (Retain, Equip, Engage, Lead). The library used these documents when creating the Diversity Task Force document and recommendations.Challenging each college and department to further diversity and inclusion on our campus and collaborate with other colleges and departments to do so.12 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesCreated a Chief Diversity Officer to coordinate activities.Creation of Office of Diversity and Inclusion; increase in level of programming at the university has provided more resources for workshops/trainings; will impact recruitment process.Diversity and equity are fundamental to the university as set out in diversity statements, policies, and guidelines. These include: President’s Statement on Diversity and Inclusion and Statement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence.Employment equity funding, and equity census, and positive space initiatives through the university’s Equity and Inclusion OfficeFounded in 2014, a group of staff committed to researching, discussing, and advocating around the relationship of diversity and justice, with a focus on race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, dis/ability, socioeconomic class, and national identity, to our workplace environment, including: diversity in hiring, retention, and promotion; diversity in service with our campus and city communities; and diversity in the library professions. Gender-neutral washrooms, inclusion in recruiting, general awareness panels, and presentationsImplicit bias training for all searches; diversity hiring initiativesIn 2014, the university created an Office of Equity and Inclusion (OEI) and hired a new director to focus in this area. The OEI has several programs that serve under-represented/protected groups. In addition, a formal advisory group related to diversity & inclusion exists as part of the university’s senate. The library’s plan involves collaboration and engagement with these entities. In fall of 2015, the university embarked on a comprehensive effort to craft a strategic plan for diversity, equity, and inclusive excellence. All campus administrative units and departments participated in defining inclusive excellence for their unit/department and developed an inclusive excellence plan.Increased emphasis on recruiting for diversity has impacted our recruitment efforts.Last year, two of our Black student groups submitted a list of actions they recommended the Institute take; one of them was a request for every department to articulate a statement that describes its commitment to diversity. The Libraries was the first unit on campus to write and publish such a statement. More generally, the Institute Community and Equity Office was created, with a mission to “advance a respectful and caring community that embraces diversity and empowers everyone to learn and do their best at MIT.” The newly created position of Libraries’ Director of Community Support and Staff Development is in part intended to lead our efforts to contribute to ICEO and related initiatives on campus.Library Diversity and Inclusion Plan touched on increasing diversity and inclusion of collections, services, staffing. Library Inclusion Committee has been formed to address action items and deliverables.Library diversity initiatives and programs are designed to align with at least one of the 6 guiding principles in the document, Inclusive Excellence: An Action Plan for Diversity.New university strategic plan. Equity Advisors for each college and Departmental Enhancement Program (ADVANCE). Creation of D&I office.Objectives of the Flagship 2020 include “Increase diversity among faculty, staff, and students”; “Increase the number of students who work with or live in diverse communities”; and “Expand supportive communities for minority, international, and first generation students”. Each academic and support unit at LSU has been asked to use the framework of the Flagship 2020 Agenda to inform their own strategic plans. The main components of the Libraries Diversity Committee charge that align with the Flagship 2020 objectives include: (1) foster a positive attitude toward diversity and inclusion within 13SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusionthe Libraries; (2) to assist search committees in the recruitment of a diverse pool of candidates for positions at the Libraries; (3) to establish and maintain a welcoming and respectful environment for all library employees and patrons. One of our core values is to foster a work environment that is free from discrimination and promotes equal, fair, and inclusive employment opportunities for the best and brightest talent available regardless of their difference.Our parent institution has been developing diversity initiatives for a long time. However, in the past few years there have been a great number of initiatives focused on various aspects of diversity. Parent institution has hired university diversity officer, required each school/college to appoint a diversity officer. Created a Council of Academic Diversity Officers and University Diversity Committee. Each group has initiatives and goals.Practices are embedded in the university’s workforce management hiring and recruitment workflow.Set broad targets for % of minority in each job category across the university.The focus of the university’s plan has not changed in recent years, but the standards and approach for demonstrating progress have been changing. The Inclusion, Diversity, and Equal Opportunity serves as a resource to the university in the interpretation, understanding, and application of federal and state equal opportunity and affirmative action laws and regulations. Ultimately, the office supports the university’s mission by providing strategic leadership in the development of policies, procedures, and programs that will help foster diversity, inclusiveness, and a welcoming environment for faculty, staff, students, and others. The library has followed the new office and began adapting HR policies to reflect these changes.The library plan was created at the request of the campus diversity initiative.The Netter Center, Greenfield Intercultural Center, Women’s Center, and various other centers, student-led committees, administrative efforts have all led to collaborations and institution-wide initiatives that have propelled our diversity efforts. The parent institution of the Library of Congress is of course the United States Congress. The Library of Congress is responsive to congressional legislation. In addition, the Library of Congress implemented its Multi-Year Affirmative Employment Program Plan from 2011 through 2016. The primary directive that impacts the Libraries’ plan was that the president now includes a diversity and inclusion initiatives section in the annual report from all deans, department heads, associate provosts, VPs, etc. This actually assists us in ensuring that our goals/initiatives are executed.The university began a campus wide Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion campaign in 2015. This included a requirement that all units, schools, and colleges develop their own diversity plan. The university has an office of Multicultural & Diversity Affairs that is housed with the Division of Student Affairs. The mission is to lead efforts in social justice and inclusion. The Libraries’ Strategic Directions 2014–2017 include statements about he promoting both external and internal efforts to support the diverse university community.The university has diversity as a strategic initiative. The university has a diversity counsel. The university launched a diversity strategic planning initiative in 2009. After the resulting Diversity Strategic Plan 2012, each major academic and administrative unit appointed a diversity officer, established a committee, and developed a related diversity strategic plan. The Diversity Department Committee chairs convene monthly for a meeting led by the Vice Provost for Diversity and Senior Advisor to the Chancellor and Office of Diversity staff.14 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesThe university provided a set of principles, initiatives, and guidelines for hiring and retention as well as multicultural training for staff.The university recently welcomed a new Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion. Some recent initiatives of her appointment have been the addition of diversity training on campus, re-evaluating diversity requirements for recruitment, and adding a diversity section to our annual staff engagement survey.The university’s institutional diversity planning initiative requires each unit, including the library, to put forth 3–5 new initiatives each year to promote diversity and inclusion. The university’s Office of Diversity and Equity and the chancellor have diversity statements. The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) advisory group wrote a report, which includes specific action steps towards DEI on campus. The Campus Climate Survey results were published on March 27. These initiatives have influenced the creation of a goal specific to DEI in the Libraries’ upcoming two-year directive and the creation of a DEI committee. The university’s strategic plan for diversity instituted a framework that called for the hiring of a Chief Diversity Officer and appointment of a Diversity Officer charged with leading their college, school, or division in developing specific unit goals and initiatives/programs. Each college unit’s Diversity Officer submits an annual report/update on the progress towards achieving unit goals and initiatives/programs and any new goals/strategies. 4.

It will also include diversity definition, goals, strategies, mission statement, etc.The diversity committee disbanded in 2008 and they had been the primary drivers of changes in the unit plan. The task force recommendations and report created the structure to assist the libraries in going deeper into this process.There are more pressing priorities at the Libraries and university.

Library arranges with central HR staff to plan and deliver presentations.Library divisions often work with the Human Resources and Diversity Programs offices to plan and deliver events for “months” that focus on ethnic or religious communities. Library senior leadership is also helping to plan and sometimes deliver. University’s chief diversity officer is helping with both planning and delivery.Library staff who are part of Change Makers—a program managed by the Women’s Center to create a more inclusive environment. Multiple people have planned, delivered, and/or collaborated with various university entities to offer presentations/programs/workshops/exhibits that support diversity and inclusion. Presenters and webinars are identified and brought to library by HR & Diversity Committee. Equity Advisor provides training for search committees.Since diversity and inclusion goals are written at the divisional, unit, and individual level each year, many units across the library engage in diversity program planning and implementation. Some programs have been arranged by our Libraries Assembly (an internal organization that serves all Libraries staff to promote communication and exchange, as well as on an advisory capacity for the Libraries administration). Other programs have been more independently created by individual librarians and library staff members, often in collaboration with other units on campus. There was also a leadership diversity/inclusion workshop last year that was proposed by a former employee who was the diversity resident librarian.Special collections and museum staff plan a lot of diversity related events and exhibitions. They also collaborate on digital humanities and digital scholarship initiatives.Staff and faculty are empowered to be involved in providing programs and presentations. Staff development committee, as well as other staff, have planned and delivered workshops for staff development purposes.Subject specialistsThe International and Area Studies Library and the Undergraduate Library also plan and deliver workshops and training for library staff.The Leadership Team (comprised of university librarian, associate directors, and team leaders)25SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionThe Libraries are committed to social justice work. Some examples are librarians and staff hosting a community Teach-In on Standing Rock, library faculty and staff leading internal workshops on critical librarianship, microagressions, Diversity 101, libraries and social justice, and libraries as non-neutral spaces. The dean’s statement supporting students performing social justice work. The Libraries Directors Council has been responsible for planning events. The Director of Program Planning and Outreach has also planned and delivered events. The Libraries’ Continuing Education Committee also plans staff programs related to diversity. The library’s administrative group, including its dean, associate dean, and division directors, are responsible for seeing that the university’s diversity initiatives and guidelines are followed. Presentations, workshops, or exhibits generally are organized and facilitated through the library departments, committees, or task groups. University Libraries HR is responsible for some, but presentations/programs/exhibits could be planned and delivered by different individuals in the UL. Since we have no diversity program, plan, or committee, it’s unclear who would be responsible (if this question refers to diversity pres/prog/exhib) because we haven’t had any internally. University’s Learning and Organizational Development Department and the Center for Multicultural and Ethnic Programs (CMEP), and the Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO)We currently don’t have anyone identified for this role. Our new committee may take on part of this responsibility. We may address this in our new strategic planning.We leverage institute-wide programmatic offerings and initiatives. These are largely sponsored and managed by the Institute Diversity unit.13.

Please enter any additional comments you have about library efforts to promote an inclusive workplace. N=21Diversity is one of the six values the library has identified for ourselves. This means it gets integrated into many library HR processes.I am fairly new to the organization. This does not seem to be a big focus for the organization currently but I hope that we make progress in this area soon.In addition to these training opportunities, the University Libraries Diversity Council and InclusiveVT representative monitor campus climate assessments, meet with other library component groups to discuss diversity/inclusion issues, and communicate with the Virginia Tech Vice Provost for Inclusion and Diversity about issues affecting library employees.In February 2017, INLP (Indigenous Nations Library Program) organized a program (The Ongoing Struggle: Abolishing the Racist Seal) about UNM’s offensive seal. This program, presented by the campus Kiva Club, was held in the University Library, and open to the entire campus community. Launched a Leadership Academy, which includes a component on diversity and inclusion.Library staff who participate in community engagement efforts to collect oral histories and digitize historical documents in minority communities benefit from the interaction.Most of the local opportunities are offered by specific employers for their own workforce. Paid for the library representative to the campus Academic Council for Diversity & Inclusivity to attend the ARL National Diversity in Libraries Conference.Several faculty are involved in Inclusive Campus, an initiative to provide education and discussions about a broad range of topics related to diversity and inclusion.

University librarian works with the ARL Diversity program as a mentor. HR staff member’s title and job description were changed to include the initiatives of diversity and inclusion for the library staff and students: Diversity, Campus Partners, and HR Development Team LeaderThe Libraries has formed a Diversity and Inclusion Working Group to work on the results from ClimateQUAL and to collaborate with Libraries HR, CMEP, and Office of Equal Opportunity. The Libraries’ Diversity Committee has sponsored a variety of activities to promote an inclusive workplace. These include hosting workshops, organizing groups to attend campus events and visit campus exhibitions, creating e-board content related to monthly diversity observances.The library invests in recruiting diverse applicant pools for all posted vacancies. The library makes excellent use of the library’s diversity committee to develop and host programs on inclusion and related cultural awareness issues. The library works closely with the university administration on diversity and inclusion initiatives. The topics covered by all of these groups include everything from having crucial conversations to creating a safe and empathetic work environment to working with colleagues from a variety of different backgrounds and identities. We are launching an informal lunch series entitled “Diversity Cafe” after testing the concept within the Library Diversity Committee. We hope to conduct another climate survey in the near future.We do several trainings/workshops in response to local and world events. For example, we had a post election workshop that allowed anyone wishing to participate a chance to come and share their thoughts/experience. We have found it very helpful to have campus partnerships to help us identify possible training, and to also provide relevant training for our staff.We have requested approval to be granted by the administration to add a librarian position to be dedicated to the ACRL Diversity Resident program. We are awaiting approval. We also conduct training related to inclusion, have diversity and inclusion as part of our core values, and partner with student organizations such as the Student Disabilities Resource Center.

Once the DI plan is complete we will identify a budget to support. The position is funded through salaries. Other funds will come from professional development or operational funds. We have had a diversity residency program for at least 10 years that supports a new librarian interested in an academic library career. This program is funded through the general funds. We occasionally sponsor exhibits and other outreach programs with support from grants.18. Over the past five years has the level of funding increased, decreased, or stayed about the same?

The Colored Conventions Project identifies and transcribes proceedings from the Colored Convention movement and makes the materials available to students, scholars, and the community.There is no longer a dedicated Diversity Librarian position as the previous person was promoted to a chair position. 19. Please enter any additional comments you have about funding for library diversity/inclusion initiatives/programs. N=16Answered Yes N=10Diversity initiatives go beyond the library. We are highly involved in programs on campus and have been recognized as campus leaders in diversity. Funding is primarily focused on our fellowship/residency program.34 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesFunding provided by the Libraries administration to support education/training workshops, Town Hall meeting, focus groups, etc. Library Staff Research Fund to support scholarly research on diversity issues. Office of Diversity and Inclusion offers the following grant programs to encourage diversity/inclusion initiatives/programs on campus: Moving Maryland Forward and Rise Above Grants.Our development officer is continually looking for donors to support our diversity programs of Information Specialist Internship Program, (ISIP) aimed at second and third year undergraduates from diverse backgrounds and the Diversity Resident Librarian. Our Diversity Council does not have regular funding for programs, recruitment/retention, or workshops. We request funding from the dean of libraries on an ad hoc basis.The dean has funds available for staff development that can be requested for diversity/inclusion programs on a case-by-case basis. The library development office is fully aware of diversity initiatives that may be attractive to donors. When they encounter a donor with diversity related interests, they meet with the Diversity and Inclusion Specialist to discuss the possibilities. The main diversity/inclusion funding initiatives indicated above have been mostly in support of our library residency program, including enhanced professional development support and attendance at specific programs (e.g., the MN Institute for Early Career Librarians) for the participating residents. We have used other discretionary funds to support separate events, such as a recent visit by a cultural diversity consultant, but aside from the residency program we do not have any funds specifically dedicated to diversity/inclusion initiatives/programs. Aside from funding the library residency program, there is no specific funding set aside for other diversity/inclusion related programs. If a program is proposed, funding is provided on a one-time basis. There is not institutional funding dedicated to all diversity programs, but there are opportunities to request additional funding. We are actively seeking development dollars to support some programming.Answered No N=6Funding can be provided if justified.Funding is available, but it is not a dedicated line.Over the past five years, the dean of libraries has used unrestricted gift funds to support diversity/inclusion initiatives and programs. This includes activities such as providing the Library Diversity Committee with a small budget, sponsoring staff members to attend the 2016 National Diversity in Libraries Conference, and paying for workshops on creating cohesive communication in the library. The Diversity & Inclusive Excellence Working Group was established in January 2017 thus no previous budget was established. A budget of $2600 has been requested to support programming efforts for fiscal year 2018. At the time of survey completion budgets for FY18 have not yet been determined. The Libraries collaborate with parent organizations such as the Disability Resource Center, Multicultural and Diversity Affairs, Office of Graduate Minority Programs, International Student Services, the Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity, and  Training and Organizational Development.The library offers a named scholarship/assistantship that supports library employment of a student registered with the institution’s Disability Services.35SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionRECRUITMENT STRATEGIES20.

N=19ACRL Diversity AllianceAdded diversity statement to librarian recruitment process.As part of our recruiting efforts for our post-LIS residency program, we have visited the LIS program at an HBCU. When visiting other library schools, we have contacted affinity groups at those schools to specifically target students from underrepresented groups.Directly invite diverse candidates to apply for positions.Encourage diversity in selection of search committees.Financial support is provided through tuition remission for all employees of the university system. (University of Nebraska-Omaha provides the LIS program through the University of Missouri.)HR has redacted names and any personal information from candidate resumes and applications so that reviews and selections will be more objective and based more on skills and qualifications.In 2014, university administration adopted a recommendation from the Diversity Council to add a statement to further the goal of recruiting more diverse faculty. This is required and the UL complies. Jointed the ACRL Diversity Alliance and have created a resident librarian position. 36 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesRecruiting early career librarians (rather than requiring the standard 3–5 years experience) allows the most diverse applicant pools.Recruiting in venues that attract diverse audiences.Target job ads to be distributed on ethnic caucus and other related listservs such as APALA, BCALA, ACRL Residency Interest Group, etc.Targeting specific listservs and job boards, highlighting diversity on website, diversity statement in postings, direct person-to-person recruitment efforts.The library participated very successfully in the CIRLA (Chesapeake Information and Research Library Alliance) post-LIS fellowships that concluded several years ago. Several CIRLA Fellows gained permanent jobs at the library and at least one, a member of a minority group, has moved into management here.Through personal invitation to apply for positions within the libraries.We are piloting a residency program beginning FY2018.We have been experimenting with redacting different information from resumes in the initial stages of review.We recently revised our position advertisements to include expanded, explicit statements about the value we place on diversity, and inviting candidates who identify as being from underrepresented groups to apply.We target diverse organizations and listservs.21. Have applicant pools at your library become more diverse in the last five years? N=55Yes 29 53%No 26 47%Comments N=24Answered Yes N=8Anecdotally, yes.Increased pools are due both to campus and library efforts. It is still a struggle.Largely due to the university’s outreach and establishment of a partnership with the city.Pools are increased in diversity. Hiring statistics remain flat for all but African American, which is down.This is difficult to measure because the library did little hiring from external postings for professional positions from 2003 through 2013. The library has increased its external professional hiring in 2014–2017 and has actively recruited for diversity. Since 2014, the library has implemented veterans’ preference, which as implemented here allows extra credit for military service. Veterans tend to be a diverse group. We have also relied on our staff to help us recruit diverse candidates. Yes, but I have no data to support that feeling.37SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionAnswered No N=10Although the post MLS residency program was intended to hire diverse faculty in the UL, we were prohibited from limiting the position to only diverse candidates. This program ceased in 2008.Demographic information on applicants is not shared by university HR.Not sure because of my limited time here.The areas of growth have become more and more selective and niche in various fields of librarianship. The information is unclear on how it is tracked. There has been an increase in male applicants, but the number of racially diverse applicants has remained mostly unchanged. There is no method of tracking this in place, so this is anecdotal. We have seen an increase over the past 10–20 years.They have remained approximately the same.This is difficult to assess within our institution [due to] lack of data regarding applicant pools.We don’t track the diversity of our hiring pools.Additional comments N=8Unable to identify data to support responding to this question.We do not have data to demonstrate an increase or decrease.We don’t have the data to answer this question.We don’t know because we do not track this data at the library level. Our Institutional Diversity, Equity, and Affirmative Action office monitors this information.We have not analyzed any data yet to determine the success of our recruitment efforts in the area of diversity. We haven’t kept stats on this, and I’ve only been here four years, so it’s hard to say.22. Has your library encountered any perceived barriers to recruiting diverse applicants for vacant positions? N=59Yes 37 63%No 22 37%If yes, please briefly describe the barrier and any success the library has had in overcoming it. N=37Occasionally, barriers may be prevalent due to tendency to look for commonalities in the candidate. There is the possibility of subconscious bias at work that we may not be aware of. Claims that there are no minorities in applicant pool. Sometimes minorities may not be screened in because (a) others more qualified were selected for interviews, (b) some minorities didn’t meet minimum qualifications.Additional requirements and longer timelines for recruiting internationally.Applicant pool of librarians is already not very diverse and geography works against us. Our local community is not particularly diverse and that discourages some from applying or from accepting offers.38 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesBarriers experienced by most libraries—scant candidates.Barriers include few diverse students graduating from LIS programs, being located in a relatively unexciting Midwestern non-diverse area. Boston’s reputation as a city that is not welcoming to diverse communities is our biggest challenge.Campus and community are not seen as diverse or welcoming of individuals who are traditional culture.Failure to reach applicants from traditionally marginalized communities; some search committees have addressed this by targeting specific listservs and LIS diversity programs. Many search committees within the University Libraries struggle with the pre-conception that applicants from traditionally marginalized communities will not want to come to a Predominantly White Institution in Rural Appalachia; we have had success in recruiting applicants to our Diversity Resident program. We have begun to see more diversity in our applicant pools, but recruitment and retention remain challenging.Geographic location, lack of diversity in library, campus and local community. No successes in overcoming barriers, yet.Identifying triggers in the employment cycle that affect the recruitment of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities across the agency has been the best step in overcoming barriers in recruiting diverse applicants.Implicit bias training for hiring managers.Incorporating language in job postings that aligns with university policies has been an obstacle. Partnering with our Office of Diversity and conveying our diversity goals to upper administrators has allowed us to be successful. Issues that are mentioned are the pipeline, the lack of diversity in the community, etc. We have also had trouble retaining folks and salary may be an issue.It continues to be difficult to identify qualified candidates from a wide range of all of our positions; however, all library search committees are required to have a diversity advocate who will serve as a voice, visible presence, and resource on the committee, including understanding campus policies and procedures, working with HR and library faculty on recruitment, and helping assure that search processes are fair. All search committee diversity advocates receive training from the campus. It seems that we don’t get very many candidates from diverse backgrounds. It seems to me that it comes down to how many diverse graduates there are; there just don’t seem to be very many in the candidate pools.Knowing where to post for a more diverse pool.Lack of diversity in applicant poolsLack of diversity in LIS program graduates; a geographic location that it is hard to attract applicants to.Lack of diversity within the organizationLack of in-depth education of the search and screens, limited time and resources to post in all of the available sources, and being a northern state with cold and snowy winters. We hope the efforts of the Equity and Diversity Committee and subcommittees will assist in overcoming the first two. Limited by the lack of diversity in the librarian candidate pools.Location in the South is always a barrier for us. Location is perceived as a barrier. We are located in a rural area 3–4 hours from major metropolitan areas.39SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionLocation of state, state politics, budget cuts, and guns on campus. Location of the university might be a barrier.Our institution is located in a very rural area that has little racial and/or ethnic diversity. It’s been hard recruiting a diverse workforce, especially recruiting people of color, to such a rural community.Our rural location Reluctance on the part of some applicants to relocate here and the perceived quality of public schools.Rigid, cookie-cutter job postings and job requirements that have not changed in years. The same job postings with the same language and requirements yield the same applicant pools. This is starting to change this year after the library hired outside consultants to review the recruitment process and make recommendations. Salary levels; percentage of diverse applicants in application poolsThe city is much more diverse and cosmopolitan than most people realize so we try to sell the area in our job announcements. The general climate in the state regarding diversity has a chilling effect. Though we post our vacancies in a variety of places, our applicant pools remain homogeneous, especially for faculty positions.We are often limited by the diversity experienced in library schools.We have a geographical barrier because of a lack of diverse populations. We have found that the current political climate in our state has affected diverse applicants from applying to some of our positions.With many positions, finding the right skill set means a small pool of candidates and difficulty in identifying candidatesAdditional comments N=3Traditional recruiting practices do not always align with diversity efforts and purposes.The current climate of North Carolina’s state government, including the passage of HB2, has definitely hurt our recruiting efforts. Unable to identify specific data to support responding to this question. At a campus level, the university issued an optional survey in Fall 2016 to all employees to understand housing needs in recognition of the high cost of living in the area. Though not supported by data, there is some sense that the high cost of living may be a barrier to recruiting at a campus level.RETENTION STRATEGIES23.

N=13An important strategy for us has been our director’s personal involvement and strong advocacy. Challenging language in and requirements listed in job postings. Having a diverse staff helps retain a diverse staff. Individuals from underrepresented groups are not isolated or alone when there is broader diversity throughout the library and campus. Providing opportunities such as affinity groups and diversity committees for those who wish to connect or contribute in that way. Ensuring that supervisors and managers are welcoming, inclusive, and respectful.In light of recent changes in the national climate we initiated a series of open discussion forums for employees to share their experiences with diversity and inclusion, and brainstorm ideas for how the Libraries can contribute to a more positive climate.Our library has joined the ACRL Diversity Alliance. Residency program is being planned now with first hires in Spring 2018.The library in 2014–2017 has offered several professional opportunities limited to applicants from within its technician (support staff) ranks. This has helped the library retain some excellent employees who would have left for opportunities at other institutions. The UL has a mentoring program that supports each tenure-track untenured faculty member to promotion and tenure; however, this program is for ALL untenured faculty, it is not limited to diverse faculty.These strategies are inclusive for all library employees. We have also specifically funded travel to and participation in non-ALA events including “The Bench by the Road Project” sponsored by the Toni Morrison Society, and the Society of American Archivists (SAA) “Liberated Archives.”We became a member of the National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity. The library has encouraged our faculty to participate in the weekly projects and workshops, and have sent a junior faculty member to the Summer Boot Camp in order to assess its effectiveness for library faculty.We have a writing group that all new librarians are encouraged to join. This is a support group to help new librarians with their research and scholarly activity. It has been very successful and popular.We have recently proposed a librarian career pathway for student workers in underrepresented groups. Also, we became members of the ACRL Diversity Alliance in February and are still in the planning stages for two residency positions. 41SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionWe include our diversity statement in all of our recruitment postings. 24. Has your library made any changes to these programs over the last five years that have improved retention outcomes? N=50Yes 10 20%No 40 80%If yes, please briefly explain the changes. N=10Ensuring that all staff go to the orientation program for new staff versus allowing it to be optional.Have our diversity residents focus work in a department rather than across several departments.Implemented diversity residency program.More support for professional development in general and leadership development in particular.Opportunities have increased at the institutional level. Our writing group was established three years ago. It has been very successful in helping our new hires work through the promotion and tenure process.Too recent to evaluate.We continually assess to make any needed updates. We have added an element in our annual performance review process, calling for each staff member to identify learning goals in this area. Also, we have earmarked travel funding to support attendance at D&I programs, in addition to the support we have always offered for attending professional conferences and job-related training events.We joined the ACRL Diversity Alliance last year and significantly modified the residency program. Additional comments N=2There are more programs and less retention. The path to success requires excellence in librarianship, significant accomplishment in scholarship, and acceptable service. It is a challenging journey for all.These programs have been very recently implemented. 25. Has your library encountered any obstacles to retaining a diverse group of employees? N=55Yes 24 44% No 31 56% If yes, please briefly describe the obstacle and any success the library has had in overcoming it. N=23A previous staff member had difficulty with connecting with individuals from their culture. They suggested that we provide at minimum a list of community resources for diverse employees as part of onboarding.Assisting residents in finding permanent employment.Campus and community climate; lack of targeted retention programs for library employees; lack of specific goals for recruitment and retention of various groups.42 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesDue to issues with promotion and tenure and opportunity for advancement, we have lost faculty. We have not focused on diverse staff attrition. Lack of affinity groups. Mentoring program has been facing challenges.Lack of diversity in library, campus, and local communityLocation of state, state politics, and guns on campusMany advancement opportunities exist for underrepresented minorities. We have very few opportunities for advancement to higher levels and so individuals go elsewhere to find those upper level positions. Past perceptions that underrepresented minorities were not treated fairly still persist. We are trying to change that perception. It’s slow progress.Our appointments as faculty bring added complexity to the work of librarians. The mentoring program, the writing groups, individual liaisons from the Promotion & Tenure Committee, and a variety of workshops help colleagues to feel motivated, supported, and valued.Our salaries are not competitive enough.Recruiting and retaining diverse groups of employees has been problematic because the applicant pool is not diverse. Retention in general is an issue for our organization as staff employees can only get promoted through open recruitment. This often means that individuals have to leave the department in order to get a higher title or pay. Rural location Salary levels; availability of permanent positions; regional obstacles (some areas have limited community opportunities and engagement)Small community that doesn’t offer sufficient personal resources for some underrepresented employees.The current climate of North Carolina’s state government, including the passage of HB2, has also hurt our retention efforts.The local community is not very diverse, creating a sense of isolation.The major obstacle is budgetary. The library simply did not have funds to fill many positions. In the past three years we have been able to fill more professional and advanced technical positions, greatly improving our ability to retain a diverse group of employees. We are willing to hire diverse librarians with no professional experience. Once they have professional experience, they are able to get jobs in more prestigious libraries in more exciting cities with better weather. We have lost some diverse employees due to the climate surrounding diversity issues in the state.We have lost two URM in the last year.We just don’t see them in our applicant pools.We’re nowhere near as diverse as is our student population.Additional comment N=1None noted in the last four years. We did very little hiring up until a few years ago, so we have a large-ish cohort going through the promotion and tenure process right now. So far, retention hasn’t been a problem.43SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionDIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EVALUATION26.

N=24Answered Yes N=10For our administrative staff positions, all applicants are asked to complete a confidential diversity survey when they apply online. We plan to include librarian positions to the online application process shortly.In accordance with our affirmative action plan.Measure faculty and staff search data: position, where advertised, applications received, candidates interviewed, offers made, offers accepted; measure applicant pool with gender and ethnicity summary; measure interview pool (# of candidates, sex, race/ethnicity of candidates interviewed).Search committee training has been established as a measurable diversity goal for 2017–2018.The agency is currently working on a strategic plan for targeted outreach and recruitment.The library reports its staffing, broken down by race, in every annual report. This permits a year-to-year comparison of recruiting/retention efforts. We have a metrics and environmental scanning team as part of our overarching diversity initiatives.We have reviewed the outcomes of recent search efforts.We keep track of applicant pools. However, not all applicants disclose their race/ethnicity, making measurements incomplete.We routinely monitor EEO totals for library staff to be cognizant of diversity. Answered Not Yet N=14Anticipate changes in institutional recruitment procedures that will allow for more assessment of practices.Census Bureau, regional, university, staff environmental scans and metricsDue to a transition in our human resources information system we can now more immediately assess the diversity of a given recruitment at any point in the recruitment process. We can extend a recruitment and try additional recruiting strategies if we feel a pool is not diverse enough. We look at the diversity of applicants in the pools and will be looking at the number of diverse hires based on the pools. Not developed yet.Our strategic plan includes a goal to study and develop measures.The assessment librarian will be working with the Office of Multicultural and Diversity Affairs to identify implicit bias in library operations, administration, and outreach.44 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesThe university has a regular diversity assessment (quantitative) for staff that we respond to annually. They have also recently done a DI survey for the campus and the results for each area will be distributed soon. The Diversity & Inclusion Working Group is making a recommendation to measure and evaluate recruitment efforts, but not exactly sure what that will look like, yet. This sounds like an approach we will be able to implement now that we hired an assessment coordinator. We are interested in a more systematic approach and have the opportunity to implement it.We are aware of issues with assessment in this type of work and are looking at ways to track it in the Libraries and the university. We are planning a periodic analysis of applicant pools.We don’t have an established assessment strategy yet to evaluate the success of diversity recruitment efforts, however we are developing library-wide assessment strategies and diversity related efforts will be one of the assessment areas. We hope to start benchmarking our efforts against other institutions. We need to develop a way to measure where we are finding diverse candidates. We’re collecting statistics on the placement of job vacancy ads and the impact on the diversity of the candidate pool.Answered No N=1Parent institutions does this.27.

The university administers staff surveys that provide some relevant information. We are participating in the university-wide climate survey and will be able to obtain library specific data. Once we have the data, we plan to conduct interviews and focus groups to dig deeper into themes. We use exit interviews as a measure.45SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionAnswered Not Yet N=10As part of our annual retention analysis we will try to look at available demographic information.Not developed yet.On-boarding, stay interviews, supervisor incentivesSame as above.

This will follow from our interaction with the Office of Multicultural and Diversity Affairs.Through the strategic plan for targeted outreach and recruitment we will have measures to evaluate our efforts.We anticipate establishing measurable goals based on results of a staff climate survey administered this past spring.We don’t have an established assessment strategy, yet, to evaluate the success of diversity recruitment efforts, however we are developing library-wide assessment strategies and diversity-related efforts will be one of the assessment areas. We will be looking at the retention numbers for staff vs. the retention numbers for our diverse employees. We will continue to do both stay and exit interviews on their experience working for us, including what went well and what we could have done better.

N=65Yes 19 29%Not yet, but we plan to 21 32%No 25 39%CHANGES IN DIVERSITY INITIATIVES/PROGRAMS30. Please briefly describe how your library’s diversity/inclusion initiatives or programs have changed over the last five years. N=60A newly formed committee focused on Diversity & Inclusion.A series of Diversity Task Forces (2013–2014; 2016) in the last five years has resulted in assessment of the library culture; creation of an Inclusive Excellence Plan; and the formation of a standing body, the Diversity and Inclusive Excellence Working group.Actively being discussed at Library All Staff Meetings, programs are announced to all staff members and encouraged to attend.Added a residency program; joined Diversity Alliance; funding for travel to National Diversity in Libraries conference; committed to one year of continuing education topics on diversity and inclusion.Around 2009 our diversity committee was disbanded. As a new dean, I hope to begin these efforts again in conjunction with our strategic planning efforts to begin in fall 2017.Created a Diversity and Inclusion Council, launched a Leadership Academy, created a detailed mentoring/coaching program.Current intense focus on recruitment through retention to see what best practices can be incorporated, as well as training possibilities. Diversity Advisory Committee and diversity and inclusion initiatives/programs have changed from focusing on social responsibility to specific strategic goals and initiatives based on our internal climate assessment of our organization, which in turn informed our Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan. Libraries senior leadership has charged the Diversity Advisory Committee to work towards a more diverse/inclusive workplace.47SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionDiversity Committee now chaired by rotating staff with interest in and commitment to D&I. This made the committee more progressive and action oriented.Effort to increase post-MLS residencies and fellowships for archivists and librarians of color. Effort to process diverse collections, especially special collections and archives. Creation of Diversity & Inclusion Working Group in 2016. We have changed some of the hiring processes.Established a dedicated Diversity Council comprised of stakeholders in every unit; established and funded a diversity residency program; established liaison relationships with intercultural offices and centers on campus; developed a librarian exchange program with Cape Peninsula University of Technology; significantly increased the number of diversity workshops, exhibits, and speakers in the library; incorporated diversity/inclusion workshops into bi-annual in-service day program.Expanded and made programs more comprehensive to those already established to help students and staff. The library has implemented Human Books this past year and will continue to include this yearly. We have also started a program called: CWRU Global Voices, a project that celebrates the individuals from around the world who make our community unique.Increased awareness. Making physical changes such as gender-neutral washrooms.Integration of a grassroots Diversity Caucus into the library’s committee structure and strategic plan. It is now a more organized effort with better-defined programs. The Equity and Diversity Committee and subcommittees are in their first year and we expect to see continued improvement in the years ahead. Less oriented toward programs and presentations designed to inform, more oriented toward open dialogue and discussion.More external hiring; more use of post-LIS internships and fellowships and of LIS practica. Our campus hired its first Vice Chancellor for Diversity & Inclusion! The Libraries had a successful and productive partnership with the vice chancellor. Some outcomes included new library programs, participation by library staff in diversity summits, etc. Our changes include the expansion of diversity projects and programming in the Oral History Department, and an emphasis on partnerships with diverse student organizations for both ongoing programming as well as special grant-funded outreach programs. In addition, faculty within the Special Collections division have become involved with the Liberated Archives discussion through SAA, and our Women’s Archives have taken on the job of documenting the January 2017 Women’s Marches within the state. Our programming for educating staff and recruiting a diverse staff have both been ratcheted up exponentially in the past five years.Parent institution has recently articulated a Workplace Diversity and Employment Equity Strategy to re-affirm its commitment and to create a framework for future progress. Previously, we had a longstanding diversity committee with only one charge: to recruit and hire the diversity resident every other year. In 2016, when the university created new standards, we began to reimagine the committee and the new committee members have been selected and will begin their work late summer.Recruitment: changes to the composition of search committees to comply with provost guidelines; experimenting on places to post job vacancies and tracking candidate pools; training committees in inclusion and unconscious bias. Change Makers: a program sponsored by the Women’s Center that annually creates a cohort of staff & faculty to engage in a personal journey to create a more inclusive environment. Library has highest number of participants from the program.48 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesSubstantial increase with in-house programming, including training workshops, exhibits, etc. Increased collaboration with university Office of Diversity and Inclusion; increased communication of development opportunities available elsewhere in university (lectures, workshops, etc.)The dean’s involvement with the Diversity Committee signified a greater importance to the effort. We have embedded diversity into the overall strategic plan, making sure we look at every initiative from a diversity perspective.The Diversity Committee has a clear purpose and greater visibility but still needs to conduct training and offer programs to improve this area.The Libraries’ Diversity Committee has become much more active, going from offering a few events a year to now offering monthly diversity-related programming. The programming offered by our Director of Program Planning and Outreach has had an increased focus on issues relating to diversity and inclusion.The library has expanded collaborations, community engagement, and partnerships. The library has modified a position that was inside HR and focused on development into a Diversity & Inclusion Specialist position that reports directly to the dean. The library’s interest and emphasis in promoting diversity and inclusion is unchanged. The university is placing more emphasis on diversity and inclusion in its HR practices. The programs and plans of the Diversity Committee have changed with the new membership roles. Younger staff have joined and focus has shifted to unconscious bias & microagressions.The quantity and depth of diversity activities and training has increased in the past five years, including numbers of library staff engaged at various levels.The required diversity preference was added in 2014.There has been a greater focus on ensuring that diversity and inclusion is woven into the fabric of all we do and less as stand-alone initiatives.They have not changed much in the past five years, but I anticipate that there will be change within the next year or so. This has become an area of greater importance over the last five years, culminating in the last year with the creation of a library Diversity Committee. This is the first year of our Diversity and Inclusion working group, so it is very early to appreciate results. I think our results will be more significant a year or two from now. We have developed a draft Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity statement to align the Libraries to the university’s statement. We hope to socialize these ideas and include diversity and inclusion as prominent values in our values statement.University-wide programs have expanded in response to changing legislation, the university’s mission, and strategic priorities.We administered the ClimateQUAL survey over a three-week period spring 2015. This has provided us with baseline data to help us evaluate many aspects of the workplace related to inclusion and diversity. It has helped us begin to think more strategically about these issues and to begin to develop plans.We are doing fewer programs with more focused efforts on microaggressions, implicit bias, creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, communication, and conflict management training for supervisors and leaders.We are now offering two minority fellow positions, which are 2-year term positions. Also shifting our focus on more inclusion rather than just diversity. We are now offering a variety of training, i.e., Trans 101, Safer Places, DBL Inclusion, etc. 49SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionWe created an inclusion director position that is a direct report to the university librarian, joined the ACRL Diversity Alliance, started a high school internship program targeting populations historically underrepresented in the profession, and are beginning a partnership with the only HBCU with a library science school.We don’t have a library diversity/inclusion program. The library relies on Human Resources to provide programs on diversity/inclusion.We had a program that offered a single library school student tuition support and financial support during school and then a paid residency program after. This program was not continued because it had little impact for the cost. We have added diversity and inclusion as core values, and a member of our team has been through intensive training on the topic. Our Associate Dean of Administrative Services is a member of the Diversity Counsel, and we have focused more on bringing staff training programs to the employees regarding diversity and inclusion. We have become more proactive in recruiting new faculty from a diverse pool. We have increased the number of places we advertise. We have also increased activities and relationships with groups on campus through outreach initiatives by librarians. We have become more systematic, more formal and also more informal, more concerned with achieving positive, specific outcomes. Changes in the world of librarianship, especially from print to electronic and ownership to access, demand that we be more cognizant of our faculty and staff, their skills and their roles, and their opportunities for success. We have broadened the scope of our diversity statement to include staff, services, and collections.We have changed the focus of our showcase series, to offer more informal presentations than in the past, inviting community leaders to participate in “kitchen table” conversations about issues related to social justice, race, ethnicity, disabilities, etc.We have created a Library Diversity and Inclusion Committee that has been charged with many library initiatives. We have expanded our efforts to insure our initiatives include more than just race/ethnicity. As a result, we have had more training opportunities in the areas of age, gender, sexual orientation, language, religion, disability and/or health status, gender identity/expression, veteran status, geographic origins, and socio-economic status.We have made a concerted effort to directly identify diversity in all our programs—calling it out as a specific component in all our programs and services.We have not had a plan or focused initiatives in the past. We now have a robust, comprehensive, measurable plan in place, so the change is significant.We have provided implicit bias awareness training to all staff with longer workshops for supervisors. We are examining our employee viewpoint survey from a variety of demographic angles.We have representation on the campus Academic Council for Diversity & Inclusion. This group is developing a theory of change for recruiting and retaining a diverse study body as well as a diverse body of faculty and staff.We haven’t had any specific plans in the past, though this may change given the creation of our recent Diversity and Inclusion Team, as well as an increasing notice on campus of issues related to diversity and inclusion. We have also recently posted a position for an Inclusion and Accessibility Librarian. A note that our Resident Librarian Program, while created more than five years ago, was partly in response to campus-wide efforts to diversify staff. However, due to budget constraints the program has 50 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responsesbeen reduced from two positions down to one. We have also worked to improve access to the Libraries’ collections and use of them by patrons through upgrades and additions to our adaptive technologies, such as braille printers, a portable reading camera, and the installation of various assistive software to our public workstations. We have also hosted a Human Library event for the past four years to celebrate campus diversity and encourage inclusive dialogue. We recently joined the ACRL Diversity Alliance and will be starting a diversity residency program soon. We have hosted ARL diversity programs and try to recruit from these cohorts. We have a comprehensive IT accessibility plan and have made changes in our website, purchasing procedures, staff training, etc.We’ve become more active and strategic in developing and providing programming for internal and external audiences.With the changing of job duties of the Diversity Librarian there has been a lack of leadership and plan. The plan has not been updated since 2010.With the creation of the diversity plan we have been more proactive in developing diversity-related programs. Additionally, we are making our diversity efforts more visible to our users and employees. 31. Please indicate which factors have influenced changes in diversity/inclusion activities at your library.

They have made recommendation for very lofty goals that will certainly challenge and motivate us to drive change in the next few years. The university’s emphasis on diversity and inclusion has helped everyone on campus become more aware of the importance of diversity/inclusion activities. There was a racially charged incident on campus, and this has led to the creation of a campus Office of Community. This office has driven a number of campus initiatives of which the library is part.32. Please briefly describe how your library has responded to social movements (such as Black Lives Matter, immigration, or the Dakota Access Pipeline protest) within the last five years. N=52Actions based on Truth and Reconciliation Report.Although the campus has not seen the depth of emotion that has impacted other campuses, our Diversity and Inclusion Council was created to increase cultural literacy on campus and within the libraries in part to prepare for a time when emotional events occur on campus.As a government agency, the Library of Congress documents social movements through its collections, but it cannot “respond” to social or political trends. As an institution, we have hosted temporary exhibits on these movements, presented community workshops on the role of librarians in social justice campaigns, and sponsored speaker series in collaboration with other university entities. Individual employees have participated in additional efforts.Attempts have been made and questions have been asked how to get involved by faculty and staff. Individuals have chosen to become more involved. The Libraries did not issue any public statements regarding these movements. Beginning in December 2016, the UIUC Library has played a significant role in creating a countywide community library social action group with the following vision: “We envision a just, equitable, and anti-oppressive community in Champaign County, central Illinois, and beyond where all library & information workers are active agents for change.” All four members of the Steering Team are UIUC Library staff. BLM book display; Hate Has No Home Here signs; other inclusive signageBy starting projects such as DataRefuge, so that information remains freely available.Classes, exhibitions, and programs on black activism and the arts. LGBTQ collections integrated in classes and exhibitions. Hosted events by campus organizations focused on social justice.Efforts have included book and poster displays, online resource guides, and exhibits. We have also provided a welcoming space for related student protests, exhibits, and events.Email address by the university librarian re: immigration and election. Supported Data Refuge efforts. Communications and training on how to verify news sources (fake news). Created gender-neutral restrooms.Exhibits, partnerships with campus cultural affinity groups, book talksFairly quiet52 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesImmigration Project: International students are an important part of our university’s story. In order to ensure that our international student’s stories are preserved, we are launching CWRU Global Voices, a project that celebrates the individuals from around the world who make our community unique. Increased and made available related resources via purchasing, research guides, etc.Informal forum discussing de-naming/re-naming of buildings; formal inclusion statementLibrarians have developed LibGuides—one for DAPL and a guide that highlights the collections of the Center for South West Research (CSWR). CSWR celebrates diversity and inclusion by collecting materials that document the experiences of people from all walks of life who have contributed to New Mexico, the United States, and the world. Made diversity and inclusion a topic of conversation for students, faculty, and staff.Most recently, our Women’s Archives, which has an emphasis on preserving information about women associated with our state, actively solicited donations of materials associated with the Women’s Marches held in our state in January of 2017, and, as previously mentioned, our Special Collections division faculty are involved in SAA’s Liberated Archives discussions.Nothing formalNothing specific related to these events.Our College Library (undergraduate library) often sees protests in their library and has worked with campus and university police to allow these protests, including Black Lives Matter, to happen peacefully within the library. We have also had many displays and our books to browse often represent social movements. We support diverse student groups and encourage them and others to gather in our spaces. We have also had presentations/discussions around recent social justice issues affecting our campus and community.Outreach to the Minority Rights Coalition, participated in the Charlottesville Human Library, hosted a safe space for students following the election.Participated in recent (i.e., post-Trump) campus rallies and provided space for student activities to support them.Post 2016 presidential election, after a rise in hate crimes and hate speech in and around libraries and college campuses, the dean of libraries issued an open letter to campus reaffirming the Libraries’ commitment to fostering mutual respect, inclusion, and intellectual freedom, as well as the Libraries services and spaces as welcoming, inclusive environments, irrespective of background or beliefs. On January 25, 2017, a grassroots solidarity event was organized by numerous employees of the Libraries to show solidarity and support of students, particularly underrepresented and marginalized student populations, and affirming the Libraries as a place of inclusion. This event was held on the same day the controversial figure Milo Yiannopolous was scheduled to speak on campus.Projects that are in progress include a Black Lives Matter LibGuide, LGBTQ LibGuide, and we’ve initiated discussions regarding gender-neutral restrooms within the library. Recognized statewide efforts to address human trafficking by offering programs on this topic. Integrated BLM into library programming.Social movements are addressed through library programming and exhibits.Some examples include: Writing a letter of support and accountability to students, staff, and faculty of color during protests on campus about race and violence towards People of Color; created a social justice library guide; created reflection rooms in two of the largest libraries on campus; provided free gender pronoun buttons for faculty, staff, and students on campus; encouraged and supported library faculty and staff to state their preferred pronouns in emails and when introducing themselves to 53SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusionothers; created lactation rooms in two of the busiest libraries on campus; added new gender inclusive restrooms on two of the largest libraries on campus; hosted a Standing Rock Teach-in; produced a public display of support for Pulse nightclub victims in Orlando, FL; posting public “all are welcome” signage following the January 27, 2017 Executive Order, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States;” supported library faculty and staff attending BLM and Trans rights events on campus; Staff have been encouraged to contribute and participate; various outreach efforts including bookmobiles, creating a political action space.The agency’s employee affinity groups have hosted and promoted events to respond to social movements.The diversity committee has had several open forums for staff to discuss and reflect in a safe non-judgmental space. The sessions have been successful.The expanded collaborations, community engagement, and partnerships mentioned above result from growing awareness and commitment to the role of libraries in social justice.The Libraries align with the university’s broader response. The Libraries faculty and staff have participated in planning and delivery of programs, (including providing technical support and facilities space to various campus groups) addressing Black Lives Matter, immigration, disability awareness, and Rise Above Week, which is designed to provide opportunities for the university community to dialogue about how to further justice and eradicate oppression. The Libraries have participated in the campus initiative related to Social Justice Day by creating an online presence to highlight campus research and library collections on the following themes: (1) Immigration in the 21st Century; (2) Economic Development and Inequality; (3) Environmental Justice; (4) Creating Healthy Communities; and (5) Media and Inequality. The Libraries has at least one librarian working on documenting social movements such as Black Lives Matter. These social movements and the current political climate have created increased awareness of issues relating to diversity and inclusion. As a result, staff have been asking for and creating training and programming. Topics have included de-escalation, implicit bias, and women in STEM/making fields. The library has hosted programs and created a new program series to provide safe spaces for having conversations about these issues. We also participate in campus conferences to discuss effective approaches when confronted with race, social, and environmental justice situations.The library has not as an organization responded to specific social movements such as the ones listed. Too many actions to list. We have very engaged faculty librarians who have the academic freedom to pursue interests.We created an online and physical book display on Black Lives Matter.We have decided to display our Principles of Community, a university-wide statement that addresses inclusivity, in the public areas of the library.We have had discussions regarding the Orlando tragedy, immigration, and DACA concerns.We have not done much in this area.We have not responded as an organization but we do have librarians and staff who participate on their own.We have offered programming and participated in campus activities.54 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesWe have started internal Safe Space Dialogues to allow library employees to openly express how such issues impact them and their lives in a safe and supportive environment. We have reached out to student organizations to offer library space for social justice activity. We have sought out social justice focused programs and have built social justice focused exhibits. We have tried to host educational events and opportunities for employees to get support.We have tried to provide opportunities for individuals, both users and staff, to share and address their concerns, such as comment boards, discussions, and providing quality information to counteract misinformation.We provide space for student organizations.We regular host table talks and forums regarding current issues, usually through our Russell Political Library. Recently, the UGA Press (which is part of the Libraries organizationally) published the Charleston Syllabus and held a symposium. Inspired by the #CharlestonSyllabus hashtag campaign born in the wake of the June 17 massacre at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, this symposium was open to UGA students and faculty to come together to discuss the current state of race relations, racial violence, and civil rights activism in the US. The program featured speakers including historians, activists, etc.We support institutional initiatives that are formulated by relevant campus partners.We’ve not directly addressed.33. Please briefly describe how these movements have affected your diversity plans/programs. N=33Accelerated them.An increased awareness in the local community of the Libraries’ commitment to diversity and inclusion.As the library has become more cognizant of the issues, the library has become determined to ensure that all students, faculty, staff, and community know that we are a safe and welcoming space.Heightened awareness and created greater urgency to create such programs.Increased awareness of student interest in using the library space in this way.Increased interest and participationIt has moved our focus from just being on diversity (meaning the presence of diversity) to also being focused on equity and inclusion. Little affect.Made our diversity plan a priority, not just nice to have on the shelf.More discussion of librarians’ roles in social justice movements.N/A. There are no plans in progress.No affectNo affect so farNo change that we can see, except perhaps a greater need to have more diversity plans/programs.Not affected our programs.One reason for the rewrite of our plan is to cover a broader scope of issues and concerns not only for the Libraries, but the campus and the broader social issues.Peripherally informed our thinking, not directly impacted our content.55SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionPrograms and exhibits address contemporary social movements.Provided a focal point on what to address.The movements have highlighted the need for us to be more active and intentional in providing programming that addresses relevant contemporary issues.The university is expanding opportunities for collaborations, community engagement, and partnerships as well.These items are kept in mind when deciding on trainings or lunch discussion topics. Social justice is also mentioned in our diversity statement and our recruiting statement.These movements have bolstered ongoing diversity efforts in the libraries. These movements have primarily provided content guidelines for library events and workshops. It is not clear how they have affected the frequency of outreach.These social movements provide a space for our committee to volunteer and partner with the university’s Office of Diversity. They have made staff more interested in them as a whole.They have steered us to a more active role, more focus on individuals, not only groups, and more dialog.They provided us with a way of emphasizing to the campus and the public that all of the library’s special collections are tied to current events in some way and are not just dusty historical reminiscences. We don’t have diversity plans or programs. We have energized our outreach efforts especially to student groups.We plan to bring relevant information to staff in timely ways.We try to develop diversity programs based on current social issues to bring awareness.When the library begins to develop a library-wide diversity strategic plan, it will be sure to include outreach to the community as one of its goals.34. Has your library used the 2012 ACRL diversity standards in any way? N=65Yes 15 23% No 50 77% If yes, please briefly describe how the library has used these standards. N=13Adopting diversity planAs a referenceAs we develop diversity-related programs and services, we establish desired outcomes or learning objectives based on the diversity standards.Mainly as a referenceThe Diversity Task Force used these when reviewing documents and working to build their report and recommendations.The standards were used as a reference to develop our Library Diversity & Inclusion Committee.We consulted the standards at the time of developing our diversity plan.We consulted the standards when developing the Libraries diversity definition and goals.56 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesWe have incorporated selected concepts into our strategic plan. The Diversity Council has also drawn goals from these guidelines. We have much more work to do.We have used those to help us with the rewrite of our diversity plan.We reviewed them when creating our diversity plan.We use the standards as a resource for determining areas for staff development activities.We’ve used as a reference starting place. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS35. Please enter any additional information about diversity and inclusion plans and programs at your library that may assist the authors in accurately analyzing the results of this survey. N=27Although we have done very little in the past 10 years to address diversity beyond supporting staff to participate at university-level initiatives, I hope to bring more attention to this issue during our strategic planning activities, commencing in fall 2017.Currently, we rely largely on the institute-wide programs to foster an environment of diversity and inclusion, and at this time don’t create additional programmatic initiatives specific to the library. We don’t have any targeted recruiting initiatives towards diverse applicants, but in the future, hope to create fellowships that target diverse candidates.In fall of 2016, the university librarian made a call to create the Diversity & Inclusion Working Group, which is charged with researching issues of diversity & inclusion for our library system and making recommendations to the administration on how to proceed. The plans include strategies around staffing/hiring/retention, user services (faculty & students), programming & exhibitions, and collection development. In spring 2017, the campus participated in an external review on diversity and inclusion requested by the chancellor. One recommendation from this review is for the campus to “develop a diversity equity strategic plan or framework aligned with the University Strategic Planning efforts that builds upon the work of previous diversity-planning efforts.” These efforts will probably take place over the next two years, and the Library Diversity Committee will look for direction from the campus regarding creating a Diversity Strategic Plan for the library. In the fall of 2016, the parent institution announced the development of an Indigenous Strategy, which is now being adopted across campus. The library has hired an indigenous student to work on related projects and acquired collections of interest to the indigenous community. Libraries have a popular social justice LibGuide. Libraries have added gender inclusive restrooms in the two most heavily used libraries. Libraries have added reflection rooms in the two largest libraries on campus. Libraries have added lactation rooms in the two busiest libraries. Little overt support is given formally to the efforts of the committee to meet our goals/plan. Membership on the committee is voluntary, and considered “extra” to folks’ regular duties. However, all financial requests have been met, with some exceptions due to the high cost of a proposal.Living in a large cosmopolitan city, we have more diversity throughout the university. We have much work to do but the university is very supportive and this is a recent development since our new president (of the university) took over in 2016. Our diversity plan was first written in 2006, and updated in 2010–2011. An in-house climate survey was done prior to 2006; the 2011 plan included a survey but this was not conducted due to changing priorities. Current diversity goals are included in our new strategic plan. A campus-wide student 57SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusionexperience survey was conducted in January 2017 as part of a university-wide diversity focus, but results from that survey have not yet been shared with the Libraries.Our library’s Diversity and Inclusion Committee is composed of faculty, staff, and administrators. We also have a Diversity Officer who liaises with other officers on campus and the university’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Our library supports the National Conference on Diversity, Race, and Learning and sends several faculty/staff/administrators to attend every year.Our newly formed Diversity and Inclusion Team is currently working on potential plans for the future. This working group was inspired by the recent university-level diversity and inclusion working group, as well as an overall need to address diversity and inclusion issues. Proposals were put forward by both a librarian with a strong interest in this issue and an administrator who felt that this team would meet a need in the library. While we do not currently have a library diversity plan, a climate survey and resulting report issued by our parent institution has resulted in more campus-wide discussions and initiatives related to diversity/inclusion, which our newly formed Diversity and Inclusion Team is taking into consideration as it moves into its pilot year. As our group was just recently formed, we are using this year to identify priorities, goals, and possible revisions to the initial charge for the year(s) ahead. Our plans don’t really fit your questions. We have initiatives and programs but they don’t necessarily fit in your categories. Recently (4/17) the Libraries received a Campus Diversity Award by the university’s most dedicated advocates for diversity as recognized by students and sponsored by various student groups (UMC, UMOJA, Latinx Coalition, Lambda Alliance, APSC, PAGE and PRISM) Relative to our operating budget and organizational influence, the University Libraries has dedicated a small amount of time, personnel, and financial resources to diversity and inclusion. We have seen significant success with programming, particularly in terms of temporary exhibits, guest speakers, and our diversity residency pilot. We have also made great progress in connecting library employees with opportunities to increase their cultural competence. However, staff demographics are relatively homogeneous (on par with or less equitable than the professional at large). We have a long way to go before we meet the ACRL Diversity Standards.Reorganization created diversity and inclusion orphans, since adopted by new leadership.Several librarians have initiated the Human Library Program to support our diversity efforts. We piloted this in October 2016 with moderate success. However, we have another one scheduled for September 5, 2017, that is focused on engaging with our African American community, both on campus and externally.Some of our efforts towards greater diversity and inclusion in our collections and outreach are ongoing so have not been captured in this survey (since there has been no change in the past five years). A number of our units, including the Archives, the Oral History Research Program, Government Documents, Maps and Spatial Data, and Community Outreach Programming have worked collaboratively with tribal libraries and museums over the years on cultural heritage grants, projects, and workshops, and we continue to do so.Strategic planning is an opportunity to include diversity and inclusion initiatives throughout our strategic priorities. The institution’s Office of Inclusion website is referenced often by our HR personnel to ensure that we are in line with university standards. 58 Survey Results: Survey Questions and ResponsesThe library’s role in providing a safe and welcoming space for our diverse campus community is the topic of staff-wide dialogue via in-person meetings, sharing staff-wide email information about what other libraries are doing, and the emergence of a staff Diversity and Inclusion Committee. The university has had a diversity and inclusion counsel for several years, and the libraries have partnered with them to provide materials that are of interest and assistance to their efforts. For example, we have added to our collections any books they recommend. We also have strong partnerships with our student government and other student organizations such as the Student Disabilities Resource Center. The university is strongly committed to the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusivity. The university has robust programs and staffing to support these principles, and the Libraries align with larger institutional goals and activities.There are designated campus offices that take the lead for ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace. The library supports these initiatives and we are guided by their policies and procedures.There are faculty who have been working with diversity initiatives and research for several years. The Libraries have supported faculty in development programs. The Center for Research in Digital Humanities (CRDH) has been supportive in the development of diversity and inclusion issues within the digital humanities field. We are striving to do more. We have a strong and widespread interest in these issues, from the administration to the front line staff.We found that many of our problems were not just isolated to underrepresented minorities. We had a bigger issue of leadership and management understanding what leadership means and how they contribute to the diversity of the libraries. We are trying to address that with a change in emphasis for programs that enhance leadership skills as well as understanding of diverse issues. Another challenge is what we call the ghosts in the library—those norms, habits, and ways of communicating that have persisted for decades. We are trying to move beyond those ghosts and find different ways of interacting with each other. It’s slow progress.We have been working with campus to change some of our gendered restrooms into gender-neutral restrooms. We also have a unique program that started in 2006 called Information Specialist Internship Program (ISIP). The program is aimed at providing an experiential learning opportunity to second and third-year undergraduates. This is a paid opportunity that includes mentoring and work experience in key aspects of the information specialist profession. This is a two-year program where interns spend time in different areas of expertise including public services, collection management and technical services, special libraries, and information technology. About 40% of our graduates have gone on to library school.59SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionResponding InstitutionsUniversity of AlabamaUniversity at Albany, SUNYBoston UniversityBoston CollegeUniversity of British ColumbiaBrown UniversityUniversity of CalgaryUniversity of California, IrvineUniversity of California, San DiegoCase Western ReserveUniversity of Colorado at BoulderColorado State UniversityCornell UniversityUniversity of DelawareDuke UniversityEmory UniversityUniversity of FloridaFlorida State UniversityGeorgetown UniversityUniversity of GeorgiaGeorgia Institute of TechnologyUniversity of Illinois at ChicagoUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignIndiana University BloomingtonIowa State UniversityJohns Hopkins UniversityUniversity of KansasUniversité LavalLibrary of CongressLouisiana State UniversityUniversity of LouisvilleUniversity of MarylandMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyUniversity of MichiganMichigan State UniversityNational Archives and Records AdministrationNational Library of MedicineUniversity of Nebraska–LincolnUniversity of New MexicoNew York UniversityNorth Carolina State UniversityNorthwestern UniversityUniversity of Notre DameOhio UniversityOhio State UniversityUniversity of OklahomaOklahoma State UniversityUniversity of OregonUniversity of PennsylvaniaPennsylvania State UniversityUniversity of PittsburghUniversity of RochesterRutgers UniversityUniversity of South CarolinaUniversity of Southern CaliforniaSyracuse UniversityTemple UniversityUniversity of TennesseeUniversity of Texas at AustinTexas A&M UniversityUniversity of TorontoTulane UniversityUniversity of VirginiaVirginia TechUniversity of WaterlooWayne State UniversityUniversity of Wisconsin–MadisonYale UniversityRepresentative Documents60  61SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionLibrary Diversity Goals, Values, Statements62  Representative Documents: Library Diversity Goals, Values, StatementsUNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA LIBRARYWhy work with ushttp://about.library.ubc.ca/work-with-us/why-work-with-us/#diversity-463SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO LIBRARYLibrary Commitment to Diversity & Inclusion https://library.ucsd.edu/about/who-we-are/diversity-and-inclusion/library-commitment.html64  Representative Documents: Library Diversity Goals, Values, StatementsUNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER LIBRARIESInclusive Excellence Plan for the University LibrariesInclusive Excellence Plan for the University Libraries  Prepared by: University Libraries Diversity Task Force  Members: Amy Arenson Clara Burns Beth Dalton Jennifer Knievel Paul Moeller Leslie Reynolds Juleah Swanson (chair)  Date: July 1, 2016   Inclusive Excellence at the University Libraries  Inclusive Excellence at the University Libraries encompasses librarians and library employees, physical spaces, and collections of digital and physical resources. The University Libraries recognizes and affirms that inclusive excellence is part of our professional practice of librarianship. The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education guides us in recognizing and instructing on how information plays a role in inclusivity and excellence. Building community, cultivating openness, and attaining a high quality of performance and service are aspects of inclusive excellence that resonate strongly with the University Libraries. Excellence at the University Libraries is to create spaces and provide services broadly, individually, and inclusively, and to provide essential scholarly resources that enable students, faculty, and the greater University of Colorado and Boulder community to discover and embrace ideas and points of view that are not part of their native experience.  Current Strategies for Inclusive Excellence at the University Libraries  The University Libraries is uniquely positioned in the campus community as a dynamic partner to all and envisions itself as the heart of higher education, providing essential scholarly resources, user-centered services, and inclusive spaces.   Being a dynamic partner means engaging with and supporting students, faculty, and campus beyond traditional roles of librarianship. Whether it is inviting therapy dogs to libraries during finals or simply listening to a student who is struggling with a course assignment, those within the University Libraries adapt their services to individual needs and contexts. Furthermore, many within the Libraries advocate beyond library activities to strengthen the inclusivity of the CU-Boulder community, from supporting the adoption of the EcoPass for all employees to sponsoring and leading a salsa club for students.  Inclusive space is also a cornerstone of what inclusive excellence is for each of our six libraries on campus. Both collaborative and quiet spaces are available to all students, meeting their academic needs in ways that few other spaces on campus can. We continue to assess and 65SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionUNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER LIBRARIESInclusive Excellence Plan for the University Librariesmodify our spaces to address the evolving needs of our students. Our libraries provide safe, welcoming, and respectful environments for all students and the campus community.   Providing scholarly resources involves the thoughtful and deliberate work of the University Libraries to enable access and discovery of information to broad and diverse student populations. Supporting and promoting a campuswide Open Access policy, standardizing the purchase of DVDs to include closed captioning, and proposing new subject headings to the Library of Congress to further discovery of distinctive materials are examples that demonstrate the comprehensive effort the University Libraries take to enhance access and discovery of information in an inclusive manner.  University Libraries Goals for Enhancing Inclusive Excellence ○ Inclusive Spaces:  ■ As high-impact, prominent spaces on campus, identify and address the need for gender neutral bathrooms within library spaces. ■ Continue assessment of spaces for ADA compliance and accessibility. ○ Dynamic Partnership:  ■ Continue to foster partnerships with campus and student organizations, formally or informally ■ Explore providing employees with training opportunities that address inclusivity in customer service and supporting diverse and distinctive populations. ○ Access to Information ■ Continue emphasis and assessment of inclusivity in access to resources including improved discovery and universal design. ○ Inclusive Excellence within University Libraries:  ■ Continue to foster and build community among those within the University Libraries, enhancing cross-departmental collaboration and communication. ■ Re-establish a standing committee for Diversity & Inclusive Excellence carrying out inclusive excellence actions.     66  Representative Documents: Library Diversity Goals, Values, StatementsUNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA LIBRARIESGeorge A.

Library staff organize, preserve, and share resources to meet the information needs of the university community, providing access to resources essential to teaching, research, and service.  Our buildings provide both the physical space and the intellectual environment for students, faculty, and staff to meet, engage, learn, and create new knowledge. Library staff go beyond the role of information gate-keepers, teaching important information literacy and research skills and proactively preserving our region’s history and culture. Reaching beyond the university community, we extend information services to the state and make our unique holdings available to the world.   VISION As economic forces and technological innovation bring major change to higher education, the LSU Libraries will transform itself so that it can continue to provide essential resources, both physical and intellectual, to support the students, faculty, and staff of the university in their pursuit of excellence.  We will  use our specialized expertise in information management to maximize access to needed information.    extend our teaching role to provide students with information literacy skills they need to achieve the highest levels of intellectual and personal development.    provide leadership in organizing, preserving and providing access to scholarship, research, and creative works produced at the university.    collaborate with teaching and research faculty, with business and industry, and with other libraries and organizations in order to share resources and better serve our constituents.   capitalize on the unique history and environment of Louisiana and LSU to enhance the LSU Libraries’ reputation as one of the top research libraries in the country. VALUES Pursuing our mission, we will value and promote  an organizational culture of flexibility, fairness, collegiality, communication, diversity, and respect;  a service-oriented culture that makes the needs of LSU’s students, faculty, and staff its highest priority;  information literacy and other skills needed for lifelong learning;  strong and diverse information resources and collections that support the university’s mission and preserve of the unique history and culture of Louisiana and the lower Mississippi Valley;  ongoing planning, evaluation, and change to maintain improvement and respond to the changing needs of the university;  engagement with the university community, the public, and the profession of librarianship to promote positive change. 73SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionLOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIESLibraries Strategic Plan 2012–2020: Goal III.

III. Diversity: Foster diversity among our faculty and staff.  In addition, we will foster diversity in the information resources we collect and to which we provide access, as well as in the services we provide, the better to serve our varied constituencies. Background: Over the last five years, the LSU Libraries has hired four staff members from groups who are currently underrepresented.  Libraries’ faculty provide presentations tailored specifically for diverse campus groups such as the McNair Scholars, the Summer Scholars, the LA-STEM students, and the Osher Lifelong Learners Institute.  We have purchased African-American research materials such as Black Short Fiction and Folklore and Black Thought and Culture (databases offered by Alexander Street Press), subscribed to the Oxford African-American Studies Center database, and subscribed to the journal Du Bois Review:  Social Science Research.    Strategies:     Develop an internship program for minority librarians, making use of vacant positions as they occur and/or with support from donors or grants.  Develop  assessment tools to guide measures to improve collegiality and morale and implement needed actions as indicated by those tools.  Develop assessment tools to determine how library services can best be individualized to meet the diverse needs of students and faculty and implement those customized services.  Augment outreach to communities in Louisiana who are underrepresented in our collections in order to foster increased collection development and preservation of unique resources. 74  Representative Documents: Library Diversity Goals, Values, StatementsLOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIESLibraries Strategic Plan 2012–2020: Goal III. Diversity http://www.lib.lsu.edu/sites/all/files/admin/LSULibrariesStrategicPlan2020.pdfLSU Libraries Strategic Plan 2012 | 7   Performance Indicators: • Increased number of library faculty and staff from groups that are currently underrepresented by approximately 10% (1 hire) per year. • Statistically significant improvement in collegiality and morale as indicated by assessment tools. • Implementation of at least one new service per year designed specifically to reach diverse constituencies, including but not limited to underrepresented groups, non-traditional students, and people with disabilities. • Increased resources documenting the history and culture of Louisianans who are currently underrepresented in our holdings, especially emphasizing African-American resources : seek a minimum of 5 new contacts with potential donors and at least one donation per year.  IV. Engagement: Foster engagement of Libraries’ faculty and staff to promote excellence and continuous improvement within our own organizational structure, achievement as researchers/scholars, and service to the profession and community. Background: The library has a mentoring program in place that has been successful in assisting tenure-track librarians to achieve promotion and tenure.  Internal training sessions occur on a bi-weekly basis, and most staff and faculty participate in two or more continuing education opportunities each semester.  In the last five years, six staff have earned advanced degrees (four in Library and Information Science) and four staff have participated in the university’s Lead/Emerge Program.  Faculty have been selected to participate in the Harvard Institutes for Higher Education Leadership Institute for Academic Libraries and the Archives Leadership Institute funded by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission.  Faculty members have held twelve elected or appointed positions in national professional organizations, and more than a dozen positions at the regional, state, and local levels.  More than a dozen faculty and staff have received national, regional and state-level awards for professional achievement or service.  Faculty serve on state and national advisory boards, including the Louisiana Historical Records Advisory Board, the Louisiana Advisory Council for the State Documents Depository Program, and the federal Depository Library Council, which advises the Public Printer of the United States.  Strategies:  The Dean’s Advisory Group will monitor implementation of the strategic plan, with a formal quarterly review.  Bringing in additional personnel as needed, the AG will conduct an annual review of the plan, revising  and updating it annually to maintain its usefulness.  The Dean’s Advisory Group will examine the library’s organizational structure and make recommendations to adapt to emerging needs.  Adopt the Google 80/20 model to encourage innovation and engagement. 75SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and

We stand with those who oppose bigotry, racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, ableism, and sexual predation and assault. We affirm that social injustices and oppression of people are wrong, and are a danger to the open, respectful environments we need to carry out our university and library missions.Libraries empower all members of our community to explore their cultures and identities, to create and access knowledge, and to connect with the full range of human experience. The values of equality and intellectual freedom, and a belief in the intrinsic worth of individuals are foundational to this work. We express these values by embracing diversity and inclusion in all of its forms including, but not limited to, differences in race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, age, religion, and economic status. We oppose any attempts, political or otherwise, to use these human characteristics to demean, devalue, or harm members of our community.The search for truth and knowledge requires access to the perspectives of not only those in the dominant culture, but also the voices of people with less power in our society, people whose viewpoints are often suppressed or omitted from the narrative. It demands critical thinking, reflection, and respectful community dialogue. It calls forthe use of courageous intellectual exploration, analysis, and evidence to advance knowledge, ideally in an environment free of discrimination and intimidation.For this reason, in our roles as library and educational professionals, we pledge to honor diversity and inclusion,to support all students, faculty, and staff—including those who are feeling vulnerable and who struggle against prejudice, discrimination, harassment, and violence—and to offer library services, content, and collections that will enable our communities’ inquiries about political, racial, and other social injustices occurring in our world.

University Diversity Goals  The structure below provides the broader context of University Diversity Goals, which represent the full reach of Cornell’s commitment to diversity. Each item in the Menu of Annual Initiatives identifies a specifically focused means of advancing one of these broader University Diversity Goals. The Diversity Goals Summary that follows repeats—in a condensed matrix format—these University Diversity Goals.  Core Diversity Principles  The University Diversity Goals are defined according to the four Core Diversity Principles—COMPOSITION, ENGAGEMENT, INCLUSION, and ACHIEVEMENT: • composition refers to the demographic make-up of the unit or institution; • engagement reflects personal, social, and professional commitment to institutional goals and activities; •  inclusion comprises climate and interpersonal relations; and • achievement reflects levels of attainment for underrepresented  individuals or groups.  Constituency Areas  Cornell’s diversity goals are organized according to the seven constituency areas:    • undergraduate students;    • graduate and professional students;  • postdocs and academic professionals (those with terminal degrees who have responsibilities in research, teaching, or the libraries, but are not included in the tenure-track ranks);    • tenure-track faculty (including tenured and non-tenured faculty);  102  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements CORNELL UNIVERSITY Toward New Destinations 2016–2017.

Measurements and Standards   Assumptions and Standards  • The concept of “diversity” extends well beyond race and sex, and the university is committed to collecting and disseminating a greater variety of diversity data in addition to these categories, but in reflection of our legal obligations to collect and report data about race and sex, metrics relating to these specific concepts are very commonly used.   • While it may be important to describe the actions a unit has undertaken pursuant to a given diversity initiative, assessment should rely primarily on data from or about constituent populations.  • Wherever possible, the efficacy of diversity initiatives should be assessed in light of centrally-maintained institutional data and widely-accepted definitions of key concepts, systematically measured and contextualized. This practice facilitates internal comparisons (such as across units at Cornell) and external bench-marking (such as with peer universities).    • It most cases, comparisons should be made as percentages and with reference to the populations and pools most relevant to a given constituency.   Institutional Support and Unit Responsibility  • The public Diversity Dashboard and the secured-access Executive Diversity Dashboard are resources that facilitate the examination of diversity by sex and race/ethnicity among Cornell constituencies.  • While there are centralized resources (such as Institutional Research & Planning and the Department of Inclusion & Workforce Diversity) that may 107SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionCORNELL UNIVERSITY Toward New Destinations 2016–2017. Appendix: University Goals Structures http://diversity.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/TND 2016 Appendix doc final.pdf8  be able to help units with measurement, units are ultimately responsible for the assessment of their own initiatives.  • Data drawn from university records and other centralized data sources can be supplemented, when necessary, with other kinds of data collected from or about diverse populations.  The use of qualitative data sources, such as focus group or structured interviews, used in conjunction with quantitative measures can provide a fuller assessment.       108  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITYDiversity & Inclusionhttp://hr.fsu.edu/?page=diversity/diversity_home109SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionUNIVERSITY OF KANSASDiversity Action Plan — Call for Commentshttps://provost.ku.edu/diversity-and-inclusion-action-steps110  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements UNIVERSITY OF KANSASDiversity Action Plan — Call for Commentshttps://provost.ku.edu/diversity-and-inclusion-action-steps111SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionUNIVERSITY OF KANSASDiversity Action Plan — Call for Commentshttps://provost.ku.edu/diversity-and-inclusion-action-steps112  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements UNIVERSITY OF KANSASDiversity Action Plan — Call for Commentshttps://provost.ku.edu/diversity-and-inclusion-action-steps113SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionMASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Institute Community & Equity Office http://diversity.mit.edu/114  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATIONDiversity and Inclusion Programhttps://www.archives.gov/eeo/policy/diversity-inclusion-policy-statement.html115SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHPolicyhttps://www.edi.nih.gov/policy/about116  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA-LINCOLN Our Core Values & Beliefshttp://diversity.unl.edu/our-core-values-beliefs117SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO President’s Statement on Diversity and Inclusionhttp://www.president.utoronto.ca/presidents-statement-on-diversity-and-inclusion118  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO Statement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellencehttp://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/PDF/ppdec142006.pdfFile under:  E  Web name:  Equity, Diversity and Excellence, Statement on [December 14, 2006] Official name:  Statement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence [December 14, 2006]  Location: https://share.utorcsi.utoronto.ca/sites/gc/Governing%20Council/All%20Policies/E/statement%20on%20equity,%20diversity%20and%20excellence.docx   [Official update: December 14, 2006][Last unofficial update:  January 14, 2015]                  University of Toronto Governing Council   Statement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence    December 14, 2006         To request an official copy of this policy, contact: The Office of the Governing Council Room 106, Simcoe Hall 27 King’s College Circle University of Toronto Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A1  Phone: 416-978-6576 Fax: 416-978-8182 E-mail: governing.council@utoronto.ca Website: http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/ 119SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and InclusionUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO Statement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellencehttp://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/PDF/ppdec142006.pdfStatement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence December 14, 2006 University of Toronto Governing Council—Web version 2     Statement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence The purposes of this statement are to express the University’s values regarding equity and diversity, and relate these to the institution’s unwavering commitment to excellence in the pursuit of our academic mission.  Equity and Human Rights  At the University of Toronto, we strive to be an equitable and inclusive community, rich with diversity, protecting the human rights of all persons, and based upon understanding and mutual respect for the dignity and worth of every person. We seek to ensure to the greatest extent possible that all students and employees enjoy the opportunity to participate as they see fit in the full range of activities that the University offers, and to achieve their full potential as members of the University community.  Our support for equity is grounded in an institution-wide commitment to achieving a working, teaching, and learning environment that is free of discrimination and harassment as defined in the Ontario Human Rights Code. In striving to become an equitable community, we will also work to eliminate, reduce or mitigate the adverse effects of any barriers to full participation in University life that we find, including physical, environmental, attitudinal, communication or technological.  Diversity and Inclusiveness  Our teaching, scholarship and other activities take place in the context of a highly diverse society. Reflecting this diversity in our own community is uniquely valuable to the University as it contributes to the diversification of ideas and perspectives and thereby enriches our scholarship, teaching and other activities. We will proactively seek to increase diversity among our community members, and it is our aim to have a student body and teaching and administrative staffs that mirror the diversity of the pool of potential qualified applicants for those positions.  Excellence  We believe that excellence flourishes in an environment that embraces the broadest range of people, that helps them to achieve their full potential, that facilitates the free expression of their diverse perspectives through respectful discourse, and in which high standards are maintained for students and staff alike. An equitable and inclusive working and learning environment creates the conditions for our diverse staff and student body to maximize their creativity and their contributions, thereby supporting excellence in all dimensions of the institution.  Excellence at the University of Toronto is predicated on core freedoms that are at the heart of every university’s mission --- freedom of speech and expression, academic freedom and freedom of research.  Responsibility  The creation of an equitable community, one that is diverse as well as inclusive and that is respectful and protects the human rights of its members, requires the work of every member of the community, across all of our sites and campuses, including students, teaching staff, administrative staff, visitors, alumni and guests.  For its part, the University will strive to make considerations of equity a part of the processes of setting policies, developing procedures, and making decisions at all levels of the institution. While for governance purposes, responsibility for the Statement resides with the Vice-President of Human Resources and Equity, daily responsibility for ensuring that the values expressed in this Statement live and breathe throughout the University will also rest with the President, the Vice-President and Provost, the Vice-Presidents and Vice- Provosts, and each Principal, Dean, Chair and Manager, within the scope of each person’s role in the University. 120  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO Statement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellencehttp://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/PDF/ppdec142006.pdfStatement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence December 14, 2006 University of Toronto Governing Council-Web version 3     The University is committed to its internal policies on issues related to equity, and also operates in compliance with all legislation that bears on equity and human rights.1                                                         1 The applicable policies and legistation include:  Statement  of Institutional  Purpose, Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, Policies and Procedures: Sexual Harrassment, Employment  Equity Policy, Statement of Commitment Regarding  Persons with Disabilities,  Statement  on Protection  of Freedom of Speech, the Ontario Human Rights Code, and any current or future guideline or procedure  dealing with equity issues.

HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES LIBRARY (Library West)  The Humanities and Social Sciences Library (Library West) is the largest branch library on the UF campus, with 17 faculty and 13 staff members, seating for 1,600 patrons, and 217 public computers, including iPads and other circulating technologies. Last year, Library West received over 1.2 million visitors. Renovated in 2006, the branch offers 18 group study rooms, a student video production space, faculty and graduate carrels as well as a limited-access floor for graduate students. One classroom is available with 19 computers for hands-on instruction. The Scott Nygren Digital Scholars Studio is a flexible space that allows seats to be arranged for individual or group projects, or auditorium style for presentations/workshops. Within the branch, there are four functional units: Research Assistance, Instruction and Outreach, Collections, and Circulation; these units are managed by coordinators who oversee the daily functions. See the organizational chart for current structure of the department.   COMMUNITY Gainesville, Florida and the surrounding community are home to approximately 257,000 people and both the University of Florida and Santa Fe College. Situated just over an hour from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, the city is surrounded by over 40 nature parks, including many spring-fed lakes and rivers.

    "abstract": "Today, diversity is defined beyond racial and ethnic groups and includes gender, sexual orientation, ability, language, religious belief, national origin, age, and ideas. The increase of published literature about cultural competencies, microaggressions, and assessment of diversity issues, as well as the inclusion of social justice movements in libraries, suggests diversity-related activities have increased and evolved over the last seven years. Over this time span, several libraries have obtained funding to support strategies to increase the number of minority librarians on their staff and support their advancement within the organization. There also appears to be an increase in the number of diversity or multicultural groups at the local, state, and national levels. However, these changes have not been consistently documented. Therefore, it is important to re-examine this topic to evaluate the impact of evolving endeavors, to see if more ARL libraries are involved, to see how diversity plans have changed over the years, and to document the current practices of research libraries. The main purpose of this survey was to identify diversity trends and changes in managing diversity issues in ARL libraries through exploring the components of diversity plans and initiatives since 2010, acknowledge library efforts since the 1990s, provide evidence of best practices and future trends, and identify current strategies that increase the number of minority librarians in research libraries and the types of programs that foster a diverse workplace and climate. The survey was conducted between May 1 and June 5, 2017. Sixty-eight of the 124 ARL member institutions responded to the survey for a 55% response rate. Interestingly, only 22 of the respondents to the 2010 SPEC survey participated in this survey, but this provides an opportunity to explore the diversity and inclusion efforts of a new set of institutions in addition to seeing what changes those 22 institutions have made since 2010.\nThe SPEC Survey on Diversity and Inclusion was designed by Toni Anaya, Instruction Coordinator, and Charlene Maxey-Harris, Research and Instructional Services Chair, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These results are based on responses from 68 of the 124 ARL member libraries (55%) by the deadline of June 12, 2017. The survey’s introductory text and questions are reproduced below, followed by the response data and selected comments from the respondents.\nThe purpose of this survey is to explore the components of diversity plans created since 2010, identify current recruitment and retention strategies that aim to increase the number of minority librarians in research libraries, identify staff development programs that foster an inclusive workplace and climate, identify how diversity programs have changed, and gather information on how libraries assess these efforts",
