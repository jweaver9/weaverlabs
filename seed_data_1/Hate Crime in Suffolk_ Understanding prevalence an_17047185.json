The aim of the project was to provide independent evidence of: the prevalence of Hate Crime in Suffolk; and the needs of victims and communities affected by Hate Crime across the victimisation themes of race, allegiance to a faith, sexuality, gender identity and disability. For this project, Hate Crime1 encompasses both hate incidents and Hate Crimes as defined by the Association of Chief Police Officers relating to race, faith, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability. The methodology included: a literature review and documentary analysis; analysis of reported Hate Crime and estimating unreported Hate Crime; survey of communities vulnerable to Hate Crime; interviews and focus groups with individuals from communities vulnerable to Hate Crime; interviews with representatives from local agencies and a workshop with representatives from local agencies. Findings from the survey, interviews, focus group and workshop findings should be treated with caution given the relatively small sample of individuals involved. The quantitative data used in the study was affected by the quality and consistency of recording.  This summary draws together the key findings from the study and three recommendations for local agencies to implement. The prevalence of Hate Crime in Suffolk  Suffolk shows the highest rates of police recorded Hate Crime (per 100,000 population) when compared to the other seven police forces in the Most Similar Force Areas group (2009-10 - ACPO data). The fact that incidents of Hate Crime are notoriously under reported suggests that the police and other agencies in Suffolk have encouraged higher reporting levels than their Most Similar Group Forces.   There is considerable variability in police recorded Hate Crimes between 2005 and 2012 in Suffolk. The peaks in the third quarter of 2009 and second quarter of 2010 appear to coincide with the establishment of the Suffolk Hate Crime Service and the rapid decline in subsequent quarters with reduced staffing at the Service.   „Insults and harassment' constitutes more than half (53.8 per cent) of all police recorded Hate Crimes, then; „physical assault‟s (22.1 per cent) or „property related offences‟ (14.2 per cent), based on data from 2005 to 2012.                                              1  Throughout this report Hate Crime (with upper case letters at the start of each word) is used to denote both Hate Crime and hate incidents  ii  The reporting and non-reporting of Hate Crime in Suffolk  The Suffolk Hate Crime Survey undertaken for this study shows that non-reporting of Hate Crime in Suffolk varies by incident type from 54 per cent for more serious incidents to 89 per cent for less serious incidents.  However, the non-reporting of Hate Crime needs to be considered against the context of non-reporting of all crime.  The British Crime Survey (2010/11) found that 62 per cent of all volume crimes (such as burglary and vehicle related crime) were not reported to the police.  Using the British Crime Survey (2006-11) and other studies, it has been estimated that police recorded Hate Crime for Suffolk is under-estimated by up to 74 per cent.  However, this estimate should be treated with caution as the comparably high levels of recorded Hate Crime in Suffolk compared to other similar police force areas indicates that the level of non-reporting may be lower than this estimate may suggest.  The Suffolk Hate Crime Survey found that the main reasons for non-reporting Hate Crime to the police were: perceived seriousness of the incident; perceived attitude of the police; incidents were a common occurrence and therefore normalised; the efficacy of the police in dealing with incidents and their willingness to act; and fear of reprisal.  The primary reason given for non-reporting of Hate Crime to the police by the Gypsy Traveller community was their families had talked them out of reporting it. The geographical distribution of Hate Crime across Suffolk  Hate Crimes which occurred between 2005 and 2012 were concentrated throughout the urban centres in Suffolk, notably Ipswich, Bury St. Edmunds, Lowestoft, Newmarket and Sudbury.  10 per cent of all Hate Crime across Suffolk took place in one lower super output area (LSOA) in Ipswich. LSOA's provide sub-ward geography averaging approximately 1,500 people.2  Over a third (34 per cent) of all Hate Crime in Suffolk took place in twenty LSOA's which equates to less than 5 per cent of the 426 LSOA's in Suffolk  Hate Crimes tend to occur in LSOA's with multiple deprivation and high crime. The enforcement and support needs of victims of Hate Crime  Suffolk Hate Crime Survey respondents indicated that the agencies they were most likely to contact to seek assistance with Hate Crime were (in rank order), the police, Ipswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality and their Doctor/GP.  For those choosing the police and Doctor/GP, the primary reason given was that they had previously received assistance from them in relation to Hate Crime and other matters.  For ISCRE, the reason was that they would “understand what I‟m going through”.                                             2  LSOA's have a minimum 1,000 population and 400 households and maximum 3,000 populations and 1,200 household thresholds.  iii   The most popular organisational attributes chosen by Suffolk Hate Crime Survey respondents were: understanding the individual‟s needs and those of their community; can act quickly; can take action against the perpetrators.  Survey respondents wanted to be informed about Hate Crime Services through „traditional‟ means such as: leaflets to the home, local newspapers and through community groups and meetings.  The survey findings suggested a tension between individuals wishing to report Hate Crimes anonymously (i.e. not disclose their identity to the police) and their desire for firm action by the police, which could only occur if their identity was disclosed to the police.  Survey respondents preferred to report Hate Crime by speaking to someone in person or by telephone rather than by text or email.  Survey respondents expected the police to catch and convict perpetrators for all Hate Crime although there was a lowered expectation in relation to less serious Hate Crime. This suggests a need by police and other agencies to carefully manage the expectations of victims in relation to outcomes that can be realistically achieved.  The survey findings indicate there may be an inverse relationship (in respondents‟ expectations of the police) between the police taking firm action and the sensitivity with which they handle the case.   Victims of Hate Crime have generic support needs, however they also have support needs which are specific to their community group, such as language support for individuals from black and minority ethnic communities; support which recognises that there may not be family support for individuals from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered communities; and that for people with disabilities, perpetrators are commonly women and someone close to them, such as a carer and/or family member.  Agency interview findings indicate that there is a need to develop an integrated Hate Crime service provision which plays to the strengths of different agencies.  Agency interview findings supported by survey, interview and focus group findings suggests the need to streamline the provision of services to victims by providing a case management/case co-ordination function to broker support/assistance tailored to the needs of victims. Recommendations It is recommended that the Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership work with its public, private and voluntary and community sector partners to: 1. Implement a framework for generic Hate Crime Service provision which covers the following stages in the Hate Crime „service process‟:  pre-incident; pre-reporting to the police; reporting to the police; criminal justice system (from a report being taken by the police to the final outcome); post criminal justice system (i.e. after the final outcome)   iv  2. Agree appropriate performance metrics which all the agencies involved in delivering Hate Crime services in Suffolk should adopt to achieve the following key objectives:   Increase the awareness of Hate Crime in the community as a whole.  Encourage and support victims of Hate Crime in making an informed decision about reporting.  Provide effective support to victims throughout the criminal justice process.  Establish a common and consistent reporting process and procedure for reporting across all agencies.  Establish a single consistent approach to the case management of a Hate Crime cases based on complexity of the victims needs  Pilot an effective counselling service for victims of Hate Crime  Establish effective and consistent partnership working  Establish an effective buddies scheme  Increase understanding of Hate Crime amongst children and young people  3. Enhance the delivery of Hate Crime Services to communities which are vulnerable to Hate Crime by reviewing existing services against the Hate Crime services framework devised as a result of this study.        1  1. Introduction 1.1 The research project This research project was commissioned by the Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership with funding allocated to them from the Ministry of Justice.  The aim of the project was to provide independent evidence of:  The prevalence of Hate Crime in Suffolk  The needs of victims  The support needs of communities affected by Hate Crime For this project, Hate Crime3 encompasses both hate incidents and Hate Crimes as defined by the Association of Chief Police Officers relating to race, faith, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability. A Hate Incident is: „Any incident, which may or may not constitute a criminal offence, which is perceived by the victim or any other person, as being motivated by prejudice or hate.‟ A Hate Crime is: „Any hate incident, which constitutes a criminal offence, perceived by the victim or any other person, as being motivated by prejudice or hate.‟ The objectives of the project were to:  Identify the prevalence of Hate Crime (as prescribed for this project) in Suffolk, including reported and non-reported Hate Crime  Identify the barriers to the reporting of Hate Crime  Understand the support needs of victims, witnesses, their families and communities  Make recommendations to address the identified needs of victims, witnesses, their families and communities; and under reporting  Propose success criteria for services As prescribed in the research specification the five Hate Crime themes which have been examined in this study are:  Racial victimisation  Victimisation resulting from allegiance to a faith community  Victimisation arising from sexual orientation  Victimisation due to gender identity  Victimisation because of disability (including, mental, physical and learning difficulties) The intended audience for this research report are:  Decision makers in Suffolk including commissioners                                             3  Throughout this report Hate Crime (with upper case letters at the start of each word) is used to denote both Hate Crime and hate incidents  2   Decision makers in statutory, voluntary and community sectors including housing providers  Private sector organisations, in particular in relation to the impact of Hate Crime on business The key purpose of this report is to identify key operational issues which can be taken forward by local agencies in Suffolk to improve the delivery of Hate Crime services to victims and communities which are vulnerable to Hate Crime. 1.2 The local context There are four key organisations which are leading the development of services to address Hate Crime in Suffolk.   Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership The Partnership is hosted by Ipswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality (ISCRE) and comprises representation from the following agencies:  Avenues Group4 (formerly known as Optua)  JIMAS5   Victim Support  Suffolk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Network6  OneVoice4Travellers7  Suffolk Constabulary8  The Suffolk Hate Crime Service  Suffolk Hate Crime Service Following a public consultation process, „Talk about Telling,‟ in June 2009, Suffolk Constabulary and Suffolk County Council worked collaboratively to develop the Suffolk Hate Crime Service. The Suffolk Hate Crime Service was set up in 2009 and is jointly funded by Suffolk Constabulary and Suffolk County Council. Co-location of the Suffolk Hate Crime service team took take place in early 2010. Suffolk Constabulary Work on Hate Crime within Suffolk Constabulary is guided by the Diversity Team and is operationalized through the neighbourhood policing teams. Suffolk County Council The county council supported the establishment of the Suffolk Hate Crime Service and encouraged the engagement of other agencies in tackling Hate Crime across the county.                                             4 A user-led Disability charity 5  A National Muslim charity set up to benefit all sectors of the community 6  Comprising of 4 groups: Men‟s, Women‟s, Transgender and LikeMinds addressing Mental Health issues 7  A regional charity representing the Gypsy Traveller Community  8  The Diversity Team represents the police  3  1.3 National context In March 2012 the coalition government produced a new three year action plan for Hate Crime, „Challenge it, Report it, Stop it: The Government’s Plan to Tackle Hate Crime’. Contained within is an explicit commitment to improving the reporting and recording of Hate Crimes as well as improving victim‟s access to support services. The coalition government clearly envisions that having better quality information will lead to improvements in the current strategic and operational response to Hate Crime. The other key shift is to place greater emphasis upon local communities (including professionals and the voluntary sector) in taking the lead to tackle all Hate Crime in all its forms, with central government providing the strategic lead in this effort. This renewed focus on localism as a key component in tackling Hate Crime has implications for the future provision of services in Suffolk, as it does elsewhere in England and Wales. 1.4 Hate Crime Hate Crimes occur against individuals or certain stigmatised groups because the perpetrator harbours a prejudice, dislike, distrust or hatred towards that group.  Often the victim will be a stranger to the perpetrator, and is usually selected on an arbitrary basis.  Hate Crimes have their roots in normative, individual and societal attitudes and ideologies that can lead to intimidation, bullying, physical assault, property damage, rape and in extreme cases, murder. Hate and bias crimes are deemed to be particularly pernicious because they can victimise not only individuals but entire communities.  In doing so they are deemed to constitute a greater wrong and the offender judged of greater culpability, than otherwise motivated crimes.  Furthermore, the normalisation of violence against a stigmatised group is both a pre-existing condition and an effect of that violence.  Hence the conditions that exist in order for a Hate Crime to be identified create an environment which in turn is sustained by each event of Hate Crime.  This can have a ripple effect, with Hate Crime also having the potential to incite community unrest and provoke retaliatory crimes (so called „secondary effects‟). Hate and bias crime can also be seen as constituting special concern for the criminal justice system when one considers the potential consequences of Hate Crimes for members of victimised groups.  When people are targeted because of their race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, sexual orientation or disability, they are likely to experience a range of negative emotions that engender greater psychological distress and over a longer duration from those experiencing non-biased criminal victimisation.9  There may also be an „attribution error‟ effect in operation by victims.  There is evidence to suggest that because of the processes of attribution in operation, victims are susceptible to attributing intent to harm on to all members of the perpetrators social group.10  Victims fear their attackers – who are rarely apprehended – along with fearing those they do not know                                             9  Craig-Henderson, K & Sloan, RL.

This can have tangible and destabilising consequences such as making unwanted changes to their lives, (i.e. changing their job or moving out of the area entirely) after the ordeal.11 The above arguments demonstrate that the impacts of Hate Crime can extend well beyond the initial victim to their wider community.  Those members who learn that a person was targeted because of their similar social category can also experience a number of negative reactions including fear, anger and despair,12 broadening the harm caused. Nevertheless, there remain some ambiguities among social scientists and commentators as to which members of particular social groups are victimised by Hate Crimes the most (and whether the Hate Crime category should be extended to include women).  What makes these, as with so many other debates in this area difficult to adjudicate are the notoriously low levels of Hate Crime reporting by victims.  The Police estimate most racist and religious Hate Crime, and as much as 90 per cent of homophobic crime, goes unreported.13  Furthermore, for those that do report incidents, victims are likely to exist on a „continuum of engagement with different agencies‟.  These are of course well known difficulties, and findings from this research provide further exploration of these issues. 1.5 Report structure The qualitative and quantitative findings from the research have been drawn together from the research activities (detailed in Chapter 2 Methodology) and themed according to the research objectives detailed in 1.1.  Chapter 3 examines the prevalence of Hate Crime in Suffolk based on recorded crime and other data.  Chapter 4 considers the reporting and non-reporting of Hate Crime and barriers to reporting.  Chapter 5, identifies the geographical distribution of Hate Crime. Chapter 6 focusses on the needs of Hate Crime victims in Suffolk.  Chapter 7 makes recommendations based on the findings including proposed “success criteria for services”.                                              11  Craig-Henderson, K & Sloan, RL.

Methodology 2.1 Research components The research was comprised of six components:  Component One – Literature review and documentary analysis  Component Two – Analysis of reported Hate Crime and estimating unreported Hate Crime  Component Three – Survey of communities vulnerable to Hate Crime.  Component Four – Interviews and focus groups with individuals from communities vulnerable to Hate Crime.    Component Five – Interviews with representatives from local agencies  Component Six – Workshop with representatives from local agencies The fieldwork was conducted between November 2012 and March 2013. 2.2 Component One – Literature review and documentary analysis  This review has drawn evidence from a range of knowledge areas, including, criminology, social and organisational psychology, sociology, law and health related disciplines.  The literature review covers research studies conducted in the United Kingdom, United States and other Western countries.  The findings therefore need to be carefully considered for their applicability to Hate Crime victims in Suffolk. A standard methodology was used in reviewing the literature.  Search terms were devised and refined and searched using a number of key online databases (National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS); International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS); Sociological Abstracts; Social Science Abstracts (SocialSciAbs); Psychology Information (PsychInfo).  As we wanted to look beyond the academic literature to identify relevant practitioner research and research undertaken by campaign and interest groups, there was an explicit focus upon website searches for research publications and any „grey literature‟.  The latter was searched using; the System for Information on Grey Literature (SIGLE) database; Index of conference proceedings; and Theses and dissertation searches.  In addition, hand searches were also made to good effect of bibliographies from key authored papers and reports.  Studies were included in the review if they were deemed relevant to the key research questions and objectives.  The literature is also very current, with many items being published in the last 5 years.  2.3 Component Two – Analysis of reported Hate Crime and Unreported Hate Crime The analysis of Hate Crime prevalence in Suffolk comprised three official data sets: Suffolk Police recorded Hate Crime and Hate incident data over a 7 year period (2005 to 2012); prejudice related incidents taking place in Suffolk schools over a 3 year period; and for  6  purposes of comparison, ACPO Hate Crime data across Most Similar Force Areas over a 2 year period.  Hate Crime report information was not available to the research team from any of the twenty two Third Party Reporting Centres14. Successive sweeps of the British Crime Survey (BCS) (2006-2011) now renamed The Crime Survey for England and Wales were used to estimate Hate Crime victimisation in Suffolk, and across different demographic groups.   2.4 Component Three – Survey of communities vulnerable to Hate Crime The survey (hereafter referred to as the Suffolk Hate Crime Survey) was made available in a paper format to agencies involved in the Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership who distributed this to members of vulnerable communities.  In addition, the survey was available for individuals to complete online.  The online survey was promoted to vulnerable communities by agencies involved in the Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership 194 questionnaires were partially or fully completed.  136 were completed as paper copies, 58 were entered directly on-line. In summary the demographic breakdown of respondents were as follows:  Gender: 193 responses; 1 answer was missing.  Slightly more females (53 per cent) than males (46 per cent) completed the survey.  2 respondents (1 per cent) preferred not to say what their gender was.  Gender identity: 174 responses.  90 per cent of respondents did not have a different gender identity to that assigned to them at birth.  7 per cent respondents did have a different gender identity.  Age: 192 responses.  Individuals aged 25-34 and 35-44 constituted the largest proportion of respondents (55 from each group).  Those aged 65 or older made up the smallest group (11).  Ethnicity: The largest number of respondents (72 or 39 per cent) were from the White ethnic group (defined as White English; White Scottish; White Irish; White Northern Irish). Gypsy and Traveller respondents made up the second largest group.    Faith: Just over one third of respondents identified as being Christians.  The second largest group were of Muslim faith (27 per cent).  20 per cent of respondents identified themselves as having no religious beliefs. The survey was completed by respondents between the 7th January and 28th February 2013.                                             14  It was reported by the Hate Crime Service that these centres (primarily voluntary and community agencies) had not been required to record and report incidents as this may have placed an administrative burden on them that they were unable to sustain.   7  2.5 Component Four – Interviews and focus groups with communities vulnerable to Hate Crime Research participants were recruited by members of the Hate Crime Partnership based on the following criteria:  Drawn from the vulnerable communities  Had experience of Hate Crime as either victims, witnesses, or family members of victims In total 40 participants were involved between (January and March 2013) comprising:   11 from black and minority ethnic communities  18 from faith communities   6 from people with disabilities and/or representing people with disabilities  3 from individuals where sexual orientation was likely to be the primary cause of Hate Crime victimisation  2 from transgendered communities 2.6 Component Five – Interviews with representative from local agencies Agency representatives were sampled based on their involvement in providing services to Hate Crime victims and in some cases on their involvement in providing more general support services to specific communities vulnerable to Hate Crime. These agencies were identified by the Hate Crime Partnership. Interviews were undertaken with the following agencies:  Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership  Suffolk Hate Crime Service  Victim Support  Suffolk County Council  Suffolk Constabulary  ISCRE  Avenues Group  One Voice for Travellers  JIMAS  Suffolk LGB and T Network 2.7 Component Six – Workshop with representatives from local agencies A workshop was held on 20th March with 25 participants from the following public and voluntary sector agencies:  Avenues Group (formerly known as Optua)15  JIMAS16                                              15 A user-led Disability charity  8   Victim Support  OneVoice4Travellers17  Suffolk Constabulary  Suffolk Hate Crime Service   Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership  Ipswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality  Enable Support Services  The Befriending scheme  Western Suffolk Community Safety Partnership  Mid Suffolk District Council  Suffolk County Council  Genesis Orwell Mencap  Leading Lives  Bangladeshi Support Centre  Suffolk Inter-faith Resource (SIFRE)  Suffolk Coastal District Council  Ipswich Borough Council  Terence Higgins Trust 2.8 Limitations of the methodology Throughout the literature review there was some variation in the quality of the evidence base and concerns over the robustness and representativeness of some material, particularly those survey designs being reliant on convenience samples. There is also a plethora of vague and often interchangeable terminology („abuse‟, „violence‟, „harassment‟) which are ill-defined terms that encompass a wide range of phenomena (Moran, 2006). It should also be remembered that research undertaken by campaigning groups needs to be read with a degree of caution, as groups may privilege pursuing their own political cause at the expense of what can be legitimately derived from the findings.  A number of data quality issues were identified with the Suffolk Police data after discussions with the Senior Performance Analyst and the Diversity Manager at Suffolk Constabulary. These are principally one of recording inaccuracy which may have led to the over-recording of some types of flagged Hate Crime by Officers. Other limitations are detailed along with the findings. The estimate of the under-reporting of Hate Crime in Suffolk needs to be treated with caution.  No standard methodology for estimating this was uncovered in the literature review.  Details of the methodology employed for this can be obtained from the research team.  The survey, interviews and focus groups with individuals from vulnerable communities were affected by the following:                                                                                                                                                  16  A National Muslim charity set up to benefit all sectors of the community 17  A regional charity representing the Gypsy Traveller Community   9   Sampling of community respondents – The recruitment process (using local agencies) and promotion of the survey and the purposive sampling of interviewees and focus group participants was intended to ensure representation from the five communities most vulnerable to Hate Crime as set out in the research specification.  It is likely that the individuals who participated had a higher level of contact and involvement with local agencies.   Experience of community respondents to the survey, community interviews and focus groups.  As with all qualitative research, the data gathered was dependent on the availability and the willingness of individuals to participate.  Therefore those who participated may have had more experience of Hate Crime and may have been more positive or negative about the experience of services in the way in which they dealt with Hate Crime.  In addition the small number of interviewees/focus group attendees may have captured limited experiences of enforcement and support services. The interviews and workshop involving representatives from local agencies were affected by the following:  Sampling of agency respondents – The sampling of interviewees and workshops participants was intended to ensure representation from agencies involved in providing Hate Crime services and agencies involved in providing more generic support and assistance to those communities which were most vulnerable to Hate Crime.     Experience of agency respondents – Those agencies directly involved in providing Hate Crime services had more experience of Hate Crime and the way in which services were delivered and could be improved.  Agencies involved in providing more generic support to communities vulnerable to Hate Crime had more limited experience of Hate Crime. Overall the relatively small number of interviewees and workshop attendees may have captured limited experiences of support services to Hate Crime victims, witnesses and their families.    10  3. Prevalence of Hate Crime in Suffolk Key findings  There is considerable variability in police recorded Hate Crimes between 2005 and 2012 in Suffolk.  The peaks in the third quarter of 2009 and second quarter of 2010 and appear to coincide with the establishment of the Suffolk Hate Crime Service and the rapid decline in subsequent quarters with reduced staffing at the Service.   „Insults and harassment' constitutes more than half (53.8 per cent) of all police recorded Hate Crimes, then; „physical assault‟s (22.1 per cent) or „property related offences‟ (14.2 per cent), based on data from 2005 to 2012.   The Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership became operational in June 2011 in a period coinciding with an upward trend in reporting, but numbers decline sharply during the next quarter and next 6 months, recovering somewhat third quarter of 2012.  No data has been recorded from third party reporting centres across Suffolk in order to minimise the administrative burden on the mainly small voluntary and community sector agencies.   Suffolk shows the highest rates of police recorded Hate Crime (per 100,000 population) when compared to the other seven police forces in the Most Similar Force Areas group (2009-10 - ACPO data).  3.1 Introduction This chapter presents findings on the prevalence of Hate Crime in Suffolk examining:  Overall Hate Crime Trends based on police recorded crime data.  The types of Hate Crime offences/incidents taking place in Suffolk based on police recorded crime data and survey responses from victims and witnesses.  The extent of Hate Crimes directed at vulnerable communities based on the five equality strands of: race; faith; sexuality; transgendered; disability; using police recorded crime data and incidents recorded by Suffolk schools for three of these five equality strands.  Frequency of Hate Crimes based on data from the Suffolk Hate Crime Survey.  A comparison of police recorded Hate Crimes in Suffolk with incidents recorded by forces in the Most Similar Group.  3.2 Overall Hate Crime Trends: Suffolk Police Data Examining Hate Crime over time (from 2005 and into 2012) there were 4,030 (77 per cent) recorded Hate Crimes, and 1,196 Hate Crime incidents (nearly 23 per cent).  These incidents have been plotted on a quarter year basis in Figure 3.1.  11   Figure 3.1: Trends in Recorded Hate Crime and Hate Crime and Incidents by Quarter Year 2005 – 2012 There is considerable variability in the trend line for Hate Crimes, and Hate Crimes peak in the second quarter of 2009 (n=227) and the second quarter of 2010 (n=226) with both calendar years seeing the highest percentage of reported offences (17.2 per cent and 17.6 per cent respectively compared to an average of 12 per cent over the other three remaining calendar years) after which rapid declines can be observed in the ensuing quarters, whereupon the number stabilise.  The Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership became operational in early June 2011, a period which coincides with an upward trend in reporting of Hate Crimes/incidents, although numbers decline quite sharply in the next quarter and over the next 6 months, only to recover somewhat in the third quarter of 2012.  However, the numbers reported during this period are lower than those during the peak periods detailed above, i.e. before the Partnership commenced. The current trend in Hate Crimes during the third quarter of 2012 is an increase in reported offences and incidents.  3.3 Types of Hate Crime Offences occurring in Suffolk Figure 3.2 shows the number of reported types of Hate Crimes, over the full 30 quarters for which there was data. These have been derived for purposes of analysis by categorizing all police Hate Crime into a simplified 7 point Hate Crime typology (further details of this are available from the research team) and do not simply relate to one specific Home Office list offence but amalgamate a number of broadly similar offences.   12   Figure 3.2: Trend Analysis of Suffolk Police Recorded Hate Crimes Data 2005-2012 by Crime Type The most common type of Hate Crime takes the form of 'insults and harassment' which constitutes more than half of (53.8 per cent; n=2167) of all police recorded Hate Crimes in Suffolk (over the total period for which data is available).  Numbers of 'insults and harassment' are at their lowest during the beginning of 2006, but increase by a third (38.7 per cent; n=+91) from 2008 to 2009, increase again the following year (19 per cent in 2010) and fall back by a similar amount (21 per cent n=-82) from 2010 to 2011.  The remaining bulk of Hate Crime is constituted by some form of physical assaults (22.1 per cent; n=889) or property related offences/vandalism (14.2 per cent; n=570). Property related offences show continued rises from 2007 (taken as a calendar year) by over 34.5 per cent; n=+19) from 2007 to 2008, and again by a similar figure (30 per cent; n=+22) into the ensuing year. The third quarter of 2008 sees the steepest rise and decline again in late 2009, after which prevalence shows some stability, with a modest fall (nearly 8 per cent; n+-8) 2010 to 2011, although numbers remain small. The steepest rise (63 per cent; n=+71) in categorised physical assaults is from 2007 to 2008, and rising more modestly (12.4 per cent; n=+17) through 2009 and remain more stable in 2010. There is a peak in 2011 and falling back into 2012.  13  The remaining four categorised Hate Crime types („Threat of violence‟; „Sexual offences‟; „Robbery/theft from person‟; and „Other‟) constitute some 10 per cent of overall Hate Crime. Threats of violence (2 per cent of all Hate Crime) were far rarer than categorised physical assaults and categorised insults and harassment. There were marked increases in Hate related sexual offences, with a quarterly rise during 2008 (n=+22) from the preceding quarter year although this is skewed by very small figures. These three quarters (2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1, Q2) constitute a spike in prevalence and see n=76 categorised sexual crimes occurring with numbers falling back sharply in the third quarter of 2009 (with the total for the remaining two quarters being n=7). The number of categorised sexual offences fluctuates after this period with smaller rises in 2010, but remaining higher overall than the very low numbers reported in 2006 and 2007. The identification of Hate Crime incident types by respondents to the Suffolk Hate Crime Survey (undertaken for this research project) are detailed in Table 3.1. This mirrors the distribution of recorded Hate Crime by incident type: inappropriate humour and non-physical abuse was most common (58 per cent and 49 per cent for victims and witnesses respectively); followed by physical abuse (23 per cent and 27 per cent for victims and witnesses respectively) then property related offences (22 per cent for victims and witnesses).  Table 3.1: Suffolk Survey: Hate Crime incident types reported by victims and witnesses Incident type Been a victim Been a witness Inappropriate humour 58% (86 of 149) 49% (73 of 149) Non physical abuse (e.g. verbal assault, abuse by social media, text) 54% (81 of 151) 41% (62 of 151) Physical abuse or violence 23% (31 of 137) 27% (37 of 137) Damage to home or property 22% (32 of 146) 22% (32 of 146) Theft/robbery 21% (30 of 143) 13% (19 of 143) Other discrimination 28% (33 of 118) 17% (20 of 143) 3.4 Hate Element of Offences (Equality Strands Analysis where there is data) Hate Crimes are also categorised by the manner of the hate element directed at a particular  victim group as well as the type of offence, so for instance, a threat of violence made against a person because of their disability would be categorised as a 'disabilist Hate Crime'.  It should be noted that Figure 3.3 displays 'racially and religiously aggravated offences' as well as 'racist' and 'faith' offences.  The research team recognise this may appear a little confusing. The explanation for this is due to the way the data is recorded by the police in order to satisfy Home Office requirements for reporting crime data more generally. The racial and religious aggravated offences (displayed as the turquoise line and making up  14  the bulk of Hate Crime) denote specific Home Office 'list' offences (i.e. racially or religiously aggravated harassment etc.) whereas the other trend lines in Figure 3.3 refer to 'flagged offences', being offences which have a hate element (i.e. a theft motivated by religious hatred for instance) which do not constitute one of the racially or religiously aggravated offences but do still constitute a Hate Crime. These 'flagged' offences are recorded according to the hate component, which can be racial, faith based, or one of the other remaining equality strands. Consequently Figure 3.4 displays two slightly different types of data. These have been treated separately for analysis at the equality strand level. The largest proportion of offences (over 61 per cent; n=2517) are recorded as 'racially or religiously aggravated offences'.  Disabilist reported offences account for over 13 per cent (n=531) of overall offences but see very considerable increases (900 per cent) from 2007 to 2008, admittedly from a low level of 4, rising to 40. The following year sees the largest yearly increase in actual numbers flagged disabilist crimes (n=+109) equating to a 277 per cent on the previous year. The last two calendar years show a see-sawing, with a near 19 per cent decrease in 2009 – 2010 (n=-28) followed by a similar level rise in 2010-2011 (n=+19) with generally reduced quarterly numbers in 2012.  Figure 3.3: Trend Analysis of Suffolk Police Recorded Hate Crimes Data 2005-2012 by Hate Component Hate Crimes flagged as 'sexual orientation' offences also account for over 12 per cent (n=501) of overall offences and show some steep rises in prevalence (although numbers are relatively small). Thus there is an increase of n=+34 flagged sexual orientation crimes  15  (equating to a 90 per cent increase) between 2007 and 2008, and increase more modestly the following year (41 per cent; n=+29) before seeing a similar level reduction in numbers (by over 19 per cent; n=-19). There is evidence that both these types of hate offences have been inaccurately reported and consequently over-recorded by Suffolk Police, although the extent of this inaccuracy remains unknown. Hate Crimes flagged as 'racist' constitute just over 10 per cent (n=414) of all Hate Crime in Suffolk, but need to be seen within the context of its larger category of Race and Religiously aggravated offences. The remaining faith and also transgender Hate Crimes account for under 3 per cent (n=47 and n=59 respectively) of the total. There are small rises in numbers of reported cases during the fourth quarter of 2008 for both transgender and faith Hate Crime, and the second quarter in 2009 for faith Hate Crime and first quarter in 2012 for transgender, although these figures remain small.   3.5 Prejudice Related Incidents Occurring in Suffolk Schools 'Prejudice related incidents' occurring within Schools in Suffolk aggregates incidents of prejudiced related harassment and includes behaviour such as teasing and bullying, (verbal, written, or cyber) physical intimidation or coercion, extortion, theft/damage of property where 'there is perceived to be, either wholly or partly, a motive, which is racist, disability related or homophobic'.18   As with Hate incidents more generally, these do not necessarily constitute criminal offences, and when taking place within the Suffolk school system are handled in accordance with the individual schools Behaviour, Attendance and Anti-bullying policies and/or Equal Opportunities policy. The exception to this is where both the alleged perpetrator and victim are staff members, then the County's Procedure for Dealing with Complaints of Harassment and Bullying are followed. Figure 3.4 displays all reported racist, homophobic and disabilist incidents over a three year period (from 2009/10 to 2011/12).19                                             18  Suffolk County Council (2009) Dealing with Prejudice Related Incidents in Schools Local Authority Advice and Guidance p6-7. 19 Data is not based on the full calendar year rather returns received up to the closing date of 14 October 2012 (Prejudice Related Incidents in Suffolk Schools 2011–2012).  16   Figure 3.4: Prejudice Related Incidents in Suffolk Schools 2009/2010 to 2011/2012 'Prejudice related incidents' occurring within Schools in Suffolk are overwhelmingly (81 per cent; n=1515) racist in nature, with a smaller number (nearly 15 per cent; n=276) being homophobic, and a smaller number still (4 per cent; n=76) being disabilist. Over a 3 year period (2009-2012) there has been a considerable reduction in recorded racist incidents, with the biggest fall in 2009/10 to 2010/11 of 146 per cent (n=-217) followed by  a 128 per cent (n=-103) fall in 2011-12.   The research team have been advised by Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership that there was a change in the guidelines given to Suffolk schools, removing the earlier mandatory requirement that all schools had to record hate prejudiced incidents occurring within their schools. Interviews with agency representatives indicated that this practice is now voluntary. This reporting practice change occurred around the same time and provides the most likely explanation for the significant reductions in racial prejudice related incidents and homophobic incidents from 2009 onwards rather than a reduction in prevalence. The overwhelming majority of prejudiced incident types are verbal in nature (88.7 per cent in 2010/11 rising to and over 95 per cent in 2011/12). 3.6 Frequency of Hate Crimes It was not possible to assess the frequency of Hate Crimes reported to the police due to the way in which incidents are recorded. The survey data shows that a majority, 56 per cent (78 of 142) of individuals who were victims or witnesses of Hate Crime had experienced this on more than one occasion. 16  17  per cent of all respondents (22 of 142) had experienced Hate Crime on six or more occasions. A detailed breakdown of frequency is provided in Table 3.2.  Table 3.2: Suffolk Survey: Frequency of Hate Crimes reported by victims and witnesses Frequency Response percentage Response count Once only 33% 43 2-3 times 28% 39 4-5 times 12% 17 More than 6 times 16% 22 Don‟t know 15% 21 Total 100 142  3.7 Comparison of Recorded Hate Crime in Suffolk compared to Most Similar Groups Police force areas (MSG’s) One means of measuring the extent of recorded Hate Crime in Suffolk (and arguably the performance of the police and local agencies in encouraging and promoting Hate Crime reporting) is to compare levels of Hate Crime reporting for Suffolk constabulary with other similar police force areas.  The Most Similar Groups Police force areas (MSG‟s) allow fair and meaningful comparisons to be made between forces.20 In undertaking this analysis Suffolk police force is compared with seven other forces across five types of Hate Crime.   Examining the total extent of Hate Crime for two years of consecutive data (2009 to 2010) Suffolk has the second highest level of police recorded Hate Crime (after the West Mercia force) when compared to its Most Similar Groups Police force areas (MSG‟s). When the population sizes within each of the eight MSG force areas, were factored into this assessment, a different distribution emerged. Figure 3.5 shows the respective rates (per 100,000 population) for Hate Crimes reported to ACPO for the MSG forces.  These are displayed ranked (here by highest racial offences) stacked with the rates of Hate Crime for each of the equality strands (with data labels where appropriate).  This shows that the Suffolk Constabulary has more police reported Hate Crime per 100,000 of its population than any of the other comparable forces.  When comparing these totals across the entire eight MSG forces, Suffolk has 21.7 per cent of reported Hate Crime                                             20  The MSG approach was developed by stakeholders from the Home Office, Association of Chief Police Officers and HMIC, with advice from independent academics. A number of social, economic and demographic variables are identified which are closely related to levels of crime and grouping the forces which are most similar on the basis of said factors (see; http://www.hmic.gov.uk/crime-and-policing-comparator/about-the-data/#peerforces)   18  (across the MSG force areas) followed by West Mercia at 17.2 per cent, and Warwickshire at 12.2 per cent, whilst the Cheshire has the lowest amount of reported Hate Crime (6.2 per cent).  The fact that incidents of Hate Crime are notoriously under reported suggests that police and other agencies in Suffolk have encouraged higher reporting levels than their Most Similar Group Forces.   Figure 3.5: Comparison of Most Similar Police Forces: Ranked by Rate of Hate Crimes (per 100,000) Stacked by Crime Equality Strand for One Combined Year (2009 & 2010/2)  3.8 Third party reporting centres Hate Crime report information was not available to the research team from any of the twenty two third party reporting centres across Suffolk.  Agency interviewees indicated that this was in order to minimise the administrative burden on the mainly small voluntary and community sector (VCS) agencies which were acting as third party reporting centres. Following the discussions which took place at the stakeholder workshop, this arrangement is being reviewed. 3.9 Conclusion This chapter has provided an overview of Hate Crime prevalence in Suffolk as revealed through some seven years of Hate Crimes known to the police.  As acknowledged above,  19  this data has shortcomings and provides only a partial lens in understanding the true extent of Hate Crime occurring in Suffolk.  At the same time one creditable way of reading the data is that Suffolk appears to be doing better than other similar force areas in learning about Hate Crimes, which is certainly encouraging.  However, more needs to be done to improve reporting and data collection in the most expeditious and feasible way.  Whilst the solution to this is certainly complex, this exercise will no doubt be assisted when a new IT system (Project Athena) is adopted by Suffolk police.  This will overcome some existing limitations of the current IT system (including being able to identify repeat victimisation and cross border repeats) and hence help inform policy at the local level. Examining police recorded Hate Crime by the different equality strands has shown some sharp fluctuations in victimisation and reporting. What is not known is the extent to which this reflects actual prevalence of incidents or changes in reporting behaviour due to some agency intervention, although likely the latter is most pertinent. Perhaps the other key message coming from the data analysis is that the wide range of infrastructure in terms of the statutory and community agencies policies and procedures can facilitate or impede the reporting and recording of Hate Crime. Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership became operational in early June 2011, which coincides with an upward trend in reporting of hate incidents.  There is other anecdotal evidence that the agencies work on the ground has resulted in increased reporting, and that when these activities have slowed or ceased, so to have the respondent reporting levels.  This is because these agencies can bring to bear a host of  'social influence variables'  (Greenburg & Ruback, 1992) which can positively influence reporting behaviour, including reporting those less serious offences such as insults and harassment which traditionally suffer some of the highest levels of under reporting.  Neither should the importance of central policy directives be underplayed.  This is borne out rather starkly when examining the trend line for prejudiced related incidents within Suffolk schools.  The data suggests a false picture of a rapid decline in incidents, however, this is far more likely due to a relaxing of the reporting requirements upon schools more generally, which has resulted in fewer incidents being reported and recorded.    20  4. Reporting and non-reporting of Hate Crime and barriers to the reporting of Hate Crime Key findings  Police recorded Hate Crime for Suffolk is under-estimated by up to 74 per cent. However, this estimate should be treated with caution as the comparably high levels of recorded Hate Crime in Suffolk compared to other similar police force areas indicates that the level of non-reporting may be lower than this estimate may suggest.  Survey findings show that non-reporting of Hate Crime in Suffolk varies by incident type from 54 per cent for more serious incidents to 89 per cent for less serious incidents.  The non-reporting of Hate Crime needs to be considered against the context of non-reporting of all crime.  The British Crime Survey (2010/11) found that 62 per cent of all volume crimes were not reported to the police.  The Suffolk Hate Crime Survey found that the main reasons for non-reporting Hate Crime to the police were: perceived seriousness of the incident; perceived attitude of the police; incidents were a common occurrence and therefore normalised; the efficacy of the police in dealing with incidents and their willingness to act; and fear of reprisal.  The primary reason given for non-reporting of Hate Crime to the police by the Gypsy Traveller community was their families had talked them out of reporting it.  National studies undertaken in the UK show that perceived seriousness of the incident and the attitude of the police and satisfaction with the response of the police and criminal justice agencies (in particular past experiences were important factors in influencing reporting/non-reporting of Hate Crime.  The circumstances of individual victims, immediate social context (families, friends, local agencies) and wider social context (at a regional and national level) embodied by Government and social norms, have a critical impact on the decision making process of whether or not to report Crime and Hate Crime.  4.1 Introduction This chapter provides the following:  An estimate of non-reported Hate Crime in Suffolk by equality strand  An assessment of non-reported Hate Crime by incident type  An identification of the reasons for the non-reporting of Hate Crime based on findings from the Suffolk Hate Crime survey illustrated by interview and focus group data with individuals from vulnerable communities  An examination of the main issues relating to non-reporting of Hate Crime based on studies identified through the literature review, set within the context of non-reporting of all crime  A framework which draws together the critical factors influencing the reporting/non-reporting of crime to the police, in particular the effects of social context   21  4.2 Estimating non reported Hate Crime in Suffolk by equality strand The following data sources and studies (based on the literature review undertaken by the research team) were used to estimate non-reported Hate Crime to the police based on equality strand:  Race and Faith (The Crime Survey for England and Wales 2006-11)  Disability - Disability Rights Commission Scotland   Sexual orientation - Stonewall, 2008   Transgender - Metropolitan Police, 2009 In summary, the estimate of non-reported Hate Crime by equality strand has been made by calculating an uplift to the police recorded Hate Crime data for 2011/12 based on the published sources of Hate Crimes known and not known to the police. This is detailed in Figure 4.1.  It should be noted that there is variation in the level of Hate Crimes known and not known by the police based on equality strand. Using the estimates for these equality strands (contact the research team for more details) and with a number of caveats, police recorded Hate Crime for Suffolk could be under-estimating the figure by up to 74 per cent. However, this estimate should be treated with caution as the comparably high levels of recorded Hate Crime in Suffolk compared to other similar police force areas (see section 3.7) indicates that the level of non-reporting may be lower than this estimate may suggest.  It has not been possible to account for this. In addition this estimate is based on the following broad assumptions:  The source data from the published studies are representative of the country as a whole  The rate of reporting of Hate Crime in Suffolk is representative of the rest of the country   22   Figure 4.1: Estimated under-reporting of Hate Crime in Suffolk: Police recorded Hate Crime uplift (2011-12) using published research  4.3 Reporting and non-reporting of Hate Crimes by incident type The level of reporting and non-reporting of Hate Crime to the police by incident type is detailed in Figure 4.2.  This is based on responses to the Suffolk Hate Crime Survey from victims and witnesses of Hate Crime.  Levels of reporting and non-reporting range from: 46 per cent reported and 54 per cent non-reported for more serious incidents of damage to the home or property and theft/robbery; to 10 per cent reported and 89 per cent non-reported for incidents of inappropriate humour. However, it should be noted that 30 per cent of victims and witnesses had also reported „other discrimination‟ to the police, something outside of their remit.      995 642 207 261 39 346 41 144 78 8 02004006008001000120014001600Racist Faith Disability Sexual Orientation TransgenderEstimated unreported number Reported to police number 23   Figure 4.2: Suffolk Hate Crime Survey: Levels of reporting and non-reporting of Hate Crimes by incident types  4.4 Reporting of all crime to the police Any consideration of non-reporting of Hate Crime needs to be seen within the wider context of low levels of reporting of volume crime more generally.  It remains the case that much volume crime goes unreported.  For instance, the 2010/11 British Crime Survey (BCS) findings suggest that only 38 per cent of volume crime incidents21 were reported to the police.  Conversely, 62 per cent of incidents of comparable crime did not come to their attention.  This represents a worsening situation from the previous 2009/10 BCS sweep, where the police came to know about 43 per cent of incidents.  However, it should be remembered that these discrepancies may not simply reflect trends in reporting rates, but also police recording practices and variation within the BCS sample (Flately et al 2010:47). What the BCS does consistently show is that the likelihood of reporting a crime varies considerably by the type of offence.  Reporting rates were relatively low for crimes such as assault with minor injury or no injury, vandalism and theft from the person with only about a third of incidents being reported to the police, whereas theft of vehicles and incidents of burglary (accruing loss) were most likely to be reported (96 per cent and 82 per cent respectively).  In these last cases victims are incentivised to report the incident in order to recover losses through insurance claims (requiring a crime number) which no doubt explains the higher level of reporting.                                              21  This refers to comparable volume crime which is a subset of crimes (such as vandalism, burglary, vehicle-related theft, bicycle theft, theft from the person, wounding, robbery, assault with minor injury and assault without injury) rather than all list offences. 0102030405060708090100Inappropriatehumour(jokes)Non physicalabusePhysical abuseor violenceDamage tohome orpropertyTheft/robbery Otherdiscrimination11 31 36 46 46 30 89 69 64 54 54 70 Yes I reported it to the police (%) No I did not report this to the police (%) 24  These BCS findings are supported by other international research studies.  An analysis of reasons given for non-reporting to the police in a study by Goudriaan et al22 across 16 industrialised Western nations (including the United Kingdom) also found that assaults and threats were the least frequently reported, with only slightly more than a third being reported.  4.5 Reasons for non-reporting of Hate Crime to the police Findings from the Suffolk Hate Crime Survey, community interviews and focus group data have identified that there were six main reasons why victims and witnesses of Hate Crimes did not report incidents to the police.  These are detailed below along with illustrative examples drawn from the free text survey responses and observations drawn from interviews and focus groups with individuals from communities vulnerable to Hate Crime. Reason 1 - Seriousness of incidents  A third (34 per cent) of survey respondents indicated that the incident was not serious enough for them to report it to the police. Given that the vast majority of Hate Crime discussed by the interviewees was of low severity, mainly name calling, community interviews and focus groups participants reported that they did not deem the Hate Crime incidents as serious enough to report to the police.  This is illustrated by the observations from the following (different) interviewees. \"I would only report to the police if someone was hospitalised or killed\" (Community interview) \"The incident was not significant enough; if it got physical I'd have felt obliged to report it\"  (Community interview) \"I would never report anything to the police, there's no point - unless I suppose it was really bad, like really extreme\"  (Community interview) However, some interviewees who had reported a non-serious Hate Crime to the police found it a positive experience. \"I really wanted to emphasise that, although it wasn't the most serious Hate Crime, my experience of reporting it to the police and the follow up I received was really very good and it has given me a lot of confidence\"  (Community Interview)                                              22  Goudriaan H., Lynch, J. P., Nieuwbeerta P., Reporting to the Police in western nations: a theoretical analysis of the effects of social context, Justice Quarterly, Volume 21 No. 4, December 2004  25  Reason 2 - Perceived attitude of the police  Almost a third (29 per cent) of survey respondents indicated that the police would not take the report seriously. This is illustrated by the following response along with a perception that if the respondent was to take action to protect themselves, the police would take action against them. “It is a waste of time reporting to them [the police], they don’t act and when you take measures to protect yourself, they arrest you and jail you.” (Survey respondent) The interview findings also indicate that the attitude of the police is a barrier to reporting. \"When I reported the second time, to a female officer at the station, I was told to \"go home and get on with it\"  (Community interview) \"And the Police Officer that went along, he said, well, 'It is his very first crime, it's like nicking a loaf of bread isn't it?' Well I thought; hang on, what about zero tolerance of crime? If you are sending a message out to a 14 year old, the message is that it really doesn’t matter does it?\"  (Community interview) However, these experiences contrast with those of other interviewees who found that the police had taken the reported Hate Crime seriously. “I was taken very seriously, especially considering there was no violence. We were not physically harmed and I know that is not a measure of severity, but it also an aggravating factor isn’t it?”  (Community Interview) \"I was really impressed with how they were and that they took it seriously…\"  (Community Interview) Reason 3 - Incidents were a common occurrence 28 per cent of survey respondents indicated that Hate Crime was a common (normalised) event and something that just happens. This is illustrated by the following account, along with an additional barrier of being unable to identify the perpetrator.  “These are occurrences when people fall over my white cane and then turn and have a go at me.  I know this is a mix of their general ignorance and embarrassment, but they can be quite aggressive sometimes.  When they are, I am too shocked and frightened to go to the police.  I just tend to stay at home  26  until I am over it. Being sight-impaired, I am not in a position to see who the aggressor is.”   (Survey respondent) The normalisation and acceptance of Hate Crime as a part of life was confirmed by the interview data as illustrated by the following observation. \"When you have been caring for someone who is special for a long while, well it's 'par-for-the-course'.  Sounds sad but true, but you are almost conditioned to learn to live with it\" (Learning disability family carer) Reason 4 - Efficacy of the police and perceived willingness of the police to act One in five (20 per cent) of survey respondents indicated that there was nothing that the police could do. This was supported by many interviewees, some who had previously reported Hate Crime incidents to the police on previous occasions reflected that given their experience, they would not report again, given that they did not see any action taken on the report that was made.  This is illustrated by the following observations: \"What would be the point [of reporting Hate Crime again]? They [the police] are not going to do anything\"  (Community interview) \"We don't ring the police anymore - they just come out, we may get a victim Support letter now and again, but the police do nothing, so have stopped reporting it\" (Community interview) \"There is no point reporting Hate Crime if nothing happens, it’s a waste of time.  All we got were promises\"  (Community interview) These experiences of the perceived willingness of the police to act, contrasts with other interviewees. \"I do think it speaks volumes- that when I reported it to the Police I had confidence that the officer would take it seriously and do a good job. So it's a subjective test really and because of that I would report again and do you know what if it hadn't have been ok, I wouldn't report again, well it would make it harder without confidence in the process\"  (Community Interview)  27  One of the issues identified through the interview data linked to police efficacy was the perceived speed of the police response. \"I believe that even if we rang up to say someone was going to break in - it would take them [the Police] hours to get here anyway.\"  (Community interview) This experience contrasted with that of other interviewees. \"They were really good, they sent somebody around, it was a bit late, but they sent somebody round. So the incident happened maybe at 7 o'clock at night and they, maybe came around about 11 o'clock at night\"  (Community Interview) Reason 5 - Fear of reprisal  16 per cent of survey respondents indicated that they feared that reporting the incident to the police would make matters worse.   This finding was supported by the interview and focus group findings which indicated fear of reprisal was a particular problem when the perpetrators were neighbours as illustrated by one survey respondent who stated that they “only reported it to the police on the day we moved house”.  This was after a reported ten months of harassment. For individuals from the transgender community the potential of being publicly identified in a court case was diametrically opposed to the privacy that the transgender community held dear: \"The reason why most Transgender do not report Hate Crime is the fear of going to court; it's not necessarily the Police, but the consequences. Because we don’t get any protection in court like rape victims do, it's not like they can give evidence behind screens, so everybody is terrified that if they do report something serious and it goes to court, the press will get hold of it\"  (Community interview)  Reason 6 - The process of reporting Analysis of the interview and focus group data identified that the process of reporting of Hate Crime was challenging for certain communities.  For vulnerable people, the Learning Disability community in particular it could be difficult for them to access the Hate Crime reporting forms, often without recourse to printers and computers.  Another complicating factor for this community was that the perpetrators may even be the victim's family, carer or close friend.  This could result in a complex situation which the victim would find confusing and distressing and therefore reporting needed to be handled carefully.  Interviewees indicated that often Learning Disability community members may  28  take some time to be able to identify the events as Hate Crime and need to have a safe enough place to acknowledge this at their own pace.   One of the issues around reporting was the investment of time (and therefore cost to the victim) of reporting. \"The reporting Hate Crime is a process that helps the police, not the victim. It means taking two hours out of your day to fill in forms and writing statements for nothing to be done\"  (Community interview) Another issue identified through the interviews was that of secondary victimisation occurring as part of the reporting process. \"We would not report again, couldn't go through that again emotionally - the process added to the terrible experience - didn’t take away from it'  (Community interview) \"Reporting is like reliving the agony'  (Community interview) It was also reported by a number of interviewees, that when reporting repeat victimisation cases, they never spoke to the same officer twice and this resulted in them having to go over and over the same information to each new officer when reporting.  Other reasons for non-reporting of Hate Crime All of the reasons given by the Suffolk Hate Crime Survey respondents for non-reporting and the proportion of respondents indicating these reasons are detailed in Figure 4.3.  Those which elicited the largest number of responses have been included above.  It should be noted that this survey was completed by a relatively small number of respondents (193) drawn from communities vulnerable to Hate Crime.  The findings of the survey therefore need to be treated with some caution.  29   Figure 4.3: Suffolk Hate Crime Survey: Reasons for non-reporting of Hate Crimes to the police by percentage of respondents A finding of note, is that almost one in four (23 per cent) of the survey respondents reported that family members talked them out of reporting incidents to the police. These respondents were all drawn from the Gypsy Traveller community, indicating that this was a specific reason/issue for this community.  The interview data also confirmed this. Some addition reasons for non-reporting of Hate Crime were identified from the interview and focus group data.  This are explored below: Language barriers  For certain communities, where English was not their first language, language was the main barrier to reporting. \"In the early days, when my English was not so good, I could not tell the Police properly…I couldn't explain good enough\"  (Community interview) Cultural/ historical barriers to reporting  In some communities, previous history and culture could make it more difficult for their members to report to the police. For example, within the Chinese community, reporting to 20 29 34 9 0 16 8 28 23 13 9 Police could not have done nothingPolice would not have bothered /notbeen interestedToo trivial/not worth reportingDealt with the matter ourselvesReported to other authoritiesFear of reprisal by offenders/makematters worsePrevious bad experience of the police orcourtsCommon event/just one of thosethings/ just something that happensFamily members talked me out ofreporting itFriends talked me out of reporting itI did not know how to report it 30  police is affected by the potential of losing face by going to a police station. In Chinese culture, 'losing face' means that one has lost their dignity, social standing, honour, and trustworthiness and bring shame on the family. In addition, Chinese people are reluctant to call 999;  \"In Hong Kong - you are told and told - you mustn't call this unless it is very, very important - so [the Chinese community] think their things are too trivial so don’t call\"  (Community representative)  A similar cultural barrier emerged from the Polish community's reluctance to report crimes to the police, as: \"The biggest barrier is the Polish history of being a communist state for 50 years, Police in Poland not as respected as here in UK. The Police in Poland were an organ of the regime, so we have no trust in the Police\"  (Community interview) Indeed, it was reported that in Poland, a person who reported to the police was labelled as a „snitch‟ by the local community (Community interview). This barrier to reporting was also reported clearly through the Gypsy Traveller community interviews:  \"We never go to the police no - you get a reputation for being a grass that way - that's a bad thing and it will never leave you - it's Taboo\"  (Community interview) \"We are not comfortable going to them - they won’t help anyway - I've heard the same story from 100's of people [from the Gypsy Traveller community] up and down the country\"  (Community interview) 4.6 Findings on non-reporting of Hate Crime from other studies The reasons for non-reporting of Hate Crime identified by the research participants in Suffolk are broadly supported by national studies.  In this section two key issues are examined in detail:  The impact of the perceived seriousness of incidents; and  The attitude of the police and satisfaction with the response of the police and criminal justice agencies Seriousness of incidents Two government reports assessing the progress made since the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report (MacPherson et al 1999), ten years on, found there had been significant  31  improvement in the reporting and recording of racist incidents23, however under reporting was still felt to remain high (Foster et al, 2005) especially for incidents perceived by victims to be „less serious‟ but which could have a cumulative impact (Docking & Tuffin, 2005).  The overall message was that more should and could be done to continue to increase reporting through increasing trust and confidence in the police (ibid, 2005: 24). The British Crime Survey analysis of Hate Crime provides some intriguing results.  The results reported below are based on combining two sweeps of data 2009/10 and 2010/11.  It appears that victims of Hate Crime were less likely than victims of BCS overall crime to say that the incident was too trivial to report to the police (55 per cent compared with 73 per cent).  Clearly this is an encouraging sign for policy makers who are interested in promoting rates of reporting.  Indeed the analysis of the BCS data shows that the police were more likely to come to know about Hate Crime than BCS crime overall; 49 per cent of incidents of Hate Crime came to the attention of the police compared with 39 per cent of incidents of BCS crime overall.  That said, non-reporting appears to be heavily influenced by victims either not experiencing the incident as sufficiently serious to report, or believing nothing can be done without providing direct evidential proof irrespective of whether the incident is distressing (Blackburn Racial Equality Council 1997, cited in Chahal and Julienne, 1999). At this point it is helpful to note that official data sources consistently show that the bulk of reported Hate Crime are cases of verbal abuse and harassment, and that violence and highly emotive crimes are the exception rather than the rule.   This point is further supported by research on perpetrators (Ray et al. 2003, 2004; Burney et al., 2002) who draw on this and their own professional practice to argue that „much of what gets labelled „Hate Crime‟ is more casual confrontations in which racist (or other hate language) is deployed‟ and consequently much of the behaviour is „more ambiguous and subject to re-evaluation by the participants who often display adherence to dominant norms of acceptable behaviour‟ (Dixon & Ray, 2007: 110).  „Mission offenders‟ who constitute the greatest potential danger due to their tendency for premeditated and targeted offending are relatively rare, whereas the more common  „thrill seekers‟ and „reactive offenders‟ seldom proceed beyond verbal abuse (Dixon & Court, 2003: 151).  Gadd et al (2005) found that racially aggravated offenders in Staffordshire also found that racism was rarely the sole motivating factor in their offending behaviour.  This was confirmed by interviews with racially motivated young offenders (Wong, Christmann, Wilcox, Smithson & Monchuk, 2008).  The evidence from agencies dealing with racially motivated offending, as well as broader community conflict problems „suggests that race is often an issue in violence and anti-social behaviour, but not the issue‟ (Dixon & Ray, 2007: 110).                                              23  Other strands of Hate Crime were added to later BCS sweeps. Religiously-motivated Hate Crime used to be asked about as a separate question (in the 2005/06 and 2006/07 BCS) but was merged into the main BCS question when further Hate Crime questions referring to sexual orientation, age and disability were introduced in 2007/08. In 2009/10, gender was added as a motivation, and transgender or gender identity was added as a motivation to the 2011/12 survey, consequently there are no available data as yet for perceived BCS transgender Hate Crime.  32  Attitude of the police and satisfaction with the police and other criminal justice agencies  Findings from the BCS (Smith et al 2012: 21) show that in only 45 per cent of Hate Crime incidents did victims think that the police took the matter as seriously as they should, compared with 65 per cent of incidents of BCS crime overall.  Similarly, there were lower levels of agreement that the police had treated victims of Hate Crime fairly (63 per cent) when compared to overall BCS crime (79 per cent), or treated victims with respect (76 per cent) compared with incidents of overall BCS crime (89 per cent).  Logically, dissatisfaction with the police response to reporting would affect reporting of subsequent victimisation (although word of mouth within victimised communities may exacerbate non-reporting still wider).  Repeat victimisation for Hate Crime (31 per cent) is marginally lower to that of all BCS crime (33 per cent).  However, victims of Hate Crime showed lower levels of victim satisfaction in the way that the police handled the matter, whilst 53 per cent were 'very' or 'fairly satisfied' compared to the more substantial 69 per cent for BCS overall crime.  Hate Crime victims were also more likely to be „very dissatisfied‟ (23 per cent) with how the police handled the matter compared to overall BCS crime (14 per cent).  Having negative experiences of reporting crime to the police, difficulties in reporting and feeling reporting is futile, are broadly consistent with findings from a number of smaller scale research projects.  Although, it is interesting to note that Goudriaan et al (2004) found that perceived police confidence had no effect on the reporting of contact crimes, but it did on the chance that property crime would be reported. The above findings are substantiated by more in-depth qualitative research.  Victim Support‟s (2005:65/6) study24 found that over three-quarters of respondents were unhappy with the police response (compared to one fifth describing positive experiences).  Many Hate Crime victims complained that they received unsympathetic treatment from the police, that the police didn‟t believe them, arrived late, or were inactive in pursuing the perpetrator or in helping the victim.  If there had been no major damage or serious physical assault then the police were seen as frequently taking the incident „very lightly‟.  In a minority of cases the police allegedly aggravated the impact of the crime due to perceived racism or homophobia, and several victims found themselves the subject of investigation (concerning their legal status) or charged with an offence.  Another frequent criticism of the police in the handling of the case was a lack of communication, especially in being updated as to the progress of cases.  It is easy to see why maintaining a channel of regular communication to keep the victim fully informed reassures the victim that the police are taking the problem seriously.                                              24  The authors interviewed 107 victims (of single and multiple incidents) in six case study areas detailing incidents across four Hate Crime strands, although incidents were predominantly comprised of racial abuse.  33  Other studies (notably in Suffolk)25 have found that maintaining regular contact through the Racial Harassment Initiative was found to be extremely important for victims, and at the time, was found to be lacking in police responses.  The importance of good communication between individuals and legal authorities and how poor communication can cause acute victim dissatisfaction is evident in a number of broader survey results (i.e. 2011 Victim‟s Voice survey; 2009–2010 Witness and Victim Experience Survey).  Some other victims in the national victim support study also complained that they had not been referred to a support agency by the police. Whilst these findings are certainly troubling, they take on greater weight when considering recent research examining the impact on citizens of encounters with the police.  Skogan‟s (2006) work in the US (replicated in several other countries, including the UK) suggest that having a bad experience with the police is four to fourteen times as great or impactful as that of having a positive experience.  Indeed there appears to be an „asymmetry‟ between how people perceive they are treated and their general confidence in the police.  The end result is rather stark for law enforcement; at its worst the police may get little or no credit for doing a good job whereas a bad experience deeply influences people‟s views of their performance, if not the entire legitimacy of the organisation (Skogan 2006). In most instances this effect was found to be stronger for citizen initiated encounters (which would include crime reporting) than police initiated ones (i.e. being stopped and questioned by the police).  Looking more specifically at Hate Crime reporting, Wong & Christmann (2008) also found that a previous negative encounter with the police, be it through police disinterest in the report, disrespect, or failing to take any action, acted as a powerful disincentive to report in future.  Furthermore, this was the case whether experienced directly or learnt second-hand from someone else.  These negative encounters also hardened attitudes making people resistant to progressive reporting messages (Wong & Christmann, 2008:26).  What these research findings suggests is having a bad experience when reporting a Hate Crime to the police can act as very powerful disincentive against reporting future victimisation, and perhaps goes some way to explain the mechanism driving elevated levels of non-reporting from Hate Crime victims more generally.   4.7 Social context and the reporting of crime  Goudriaan, Lynch and Nieuwbeerta 200426 considered the influence of wider social context on the reporting of crime by examining incident level data from the International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS) for 16 western industrialised countries including the UK and United States.  They devised a framework, reproduced in Table 4.1, which makes the distinction between three geographically defined social contexts and two types of considerations.  The social contexts cover, the micro level, meso and macro level, with the                                             25 Garland, J., Chakraborti, N. (2002).

In doing so the authors emphasize the wider social context in which the crime took place.  This framework is applicable to Hate Crime and helps to crystallise the factors which contribute to reporting/non-reporting of Hate Crime which have been explored in detail in the rest of this chapter. The decision to report criminal victimisation is not exclusively influenced by attributes of the crime situation (such as the severity of the incident), but also community and national level characteristics.  For property crimes, the authors found a significant effect of the perceived police competence only.  In countries where the police were perceived to be more competent, victims were more likely to report property crime victimisations.  This finding has obvious implications for Hate Crime as well, although more work is needed to understand the effect of national context on the reporting of both contact crimes and crime more generally.

At the same time there is a considerable body of research both nationally and internationally which suggests that Hate Crime is very considerably under-reported.  What the true figure of Hate Crime actually is, rather like that of volume crime more generally, remains unknown.  The estimate of the unreported Hate Crime in Suffolk for this study highlights that the bulk of Hate Crime not coming to the attention of the police, or indeed, any authority.  This finding is unsurprising, and is not in any way characteristic or particular to Suffolk, rather it reflects the wider national picture of chronic under reporting more generally.  This leads to at least one general conclusion, that data on the nature and extent of Hate Crimes are still lacking, and this will invariably impede the development of effective response strategies in the county.  It has long been recognised that there are a wide range of reasons for victims' reluctance in coming forward and reporting Hate Crime.  This involves a complex interaction of factors which influence the decision by victims to report, including recognition that a crime has taken place, the characteristics of victims, a cost benefit analysis to reporting, the responses of acquaintances, family and friends, along with a number of wider social context and community factors. Under reporting can also vary very considerably across traditionally victimised groups, creating under reporting trends amongst communities who experience barriers differently. For Hate Crime victims some of these factors will be more salient than others in influencing reporting or non-reporting dependent on the nature of the Hate Crime i.e. whether it is racially motivated, homophobic, disabilist or based on religion. This complexity suggests that more widely shared knowledge that a reporting service to non-police agencies exists is of itself unlikely to be sufficient to trigger the reporting of Hate Crimes.  Increasing reporting to the police and non-police agencies requires the Partnership to identify ways to change the attitudes, behaviour and decision making of victims, their family, friends and acquaintances. The survey findings bear this lesson out, and suggest a number of points of intervention.  Clearly one of the biggest challenges is when victims do not perceive an incident is serious enough to report, likely because they undertake a cost-benefit calculation (consciously or unconsciously) in deciding whether it is worth the effort involved in contacting the police and making a report.  No doubt social marketing exercises can have some impact on changing these attitudes, but these gains are likely to be modest even in respect of a targeted approach.  The area which is more open to change is the responses from statutory and community agencies, particularly the police.  At the very least victims must have confidence in the law and in the police who principally enforce it to make reporting worthwhile.  Findings from our own survey and the wider research evidence echo the overall message from the earlier post Lawrence review (Tuffin, 2005) that more work needs to be done to increase reporting through increasing trust and confidence in the police.  Victims are clearly still sceptical about the willingness of officers to respond to their victimisation.  As we have  36  seen, part of the reason for the non-reporting of Hate Crime is as a direct result of victims past negative experiences of the police.  That the police can have such a profound influence on reporting behaviour also provides an opportunity to improve current service performance.  This will require the police to deliver an improved service experience to all victims, crucially on a more consistent basis.  This is not because of some evidence of Suffolk Constabulary failing,27 rather that Skogan's work demonstrates how damaging a negative encounter can be for citizen's attitudes towards the police.  Therefore a few poorly performing officers working in any large organisation can have a disproportionate impact on how the force is viewed as a whole, discouraging reporting and sending a message that Hate Crime is not a force priority.   One area of service delivery which causes a great deal of victim dissatisfaction and has a direct impact on confidence in the criminal justice system (Victim Support 2011) is the victim being kept informed about a case having made a report.  Recent innovations in IT software such as TrackMyCase (TMC)28 provides one means of rectifying the communication deficit and has been adopted by several UK police forces.  The system allows victims to know who the investigating officer is, and to see any progress with the case since making the report; to see how the investigation is progressing, whether anyone had been charged, if the case is going to court, the trial date, and the outcome of any court case (Muir, 2012:10).  At present it is extremely difficult for victims to access any meaningful information on how their case is progressing without directly talking to the investigating officer(s), who, if known, can be difficult to contact due to shift patterns and officer availability.  There is encouraging evidence from early evaluations that TMC technology demonstrates a high level of satisfaction among both users (and police officers) and would provide one means of improving Hate Crime victim satisfaction with statutory services.  It would also hold out the promise of perhaps driving greater reporting of Hate Crime for some victims (Open Justice, 2012). We also know that the decision to report criminal victimisation is not exclusively influenced by attributes of the crime situation (such as the severity of the incident), but also by social influence variables.  Crime victims often talk with others before making a decision about reporting, and due to their more emotionally aroused state, are more susceptible to the influence of these others.  Indeed, there is reason to believe that these social influence variables may be the real 'gatekeeper' to the criminal justice system rather than the police, or indeed the victim's own cost-benefit analysis.  Those people who the victim consults directly after the crime has occurred have been described as the „neglected decision maker‟ in the criminal justice system, and one whom information campaigns should be directed at (Greenburg & Ruback, 1992: 240-241).  Our survey reinforces this finding, notably for the Gypsy and Traveller communities where under-reporting Hate Crime is the norm.                                                 27  The Independent Advisory Group (IAG, 2012) for Suffolk Constabulary has not reported any concern regards Suffolk Constabularies handling of Hate Crime or treatment of Hate Crime victims, although such body‟s level of scrutiny is only minimal. We do note that the IAG will be receiving an update on the subject of Hate Crime later in 2013. 28  TMC was introduced by Avon and Somerset Constabulary in March 2011. In addition several other forces (Sussex, Derbyshire and South Wales) are progressing to roll out their own versions, with a further 30 forces showing 'interest' in the service (Muir, 2012:11).  37  5. The geographical distribution of Hate Crime in Suffolk  Key findings   Hate Crimes which occurred between 2005 to 2012 were concentrated throughout the major urban centres in Suffolk, notably Ipswich, Bury St. Edmonds, Lowestoft, Newmarket and Sudbury.  10 per cent of all Hate Crime across Suffolk took place in one lower super output area (LSOA) in Ipswich.  LSOA's provide sub-ward geography averaging approximately 1,500 people.29  Over a third (34 per cent) of all Hate Crime in Suffolk took place in twenty LSOA's which equates to less than 5 per cent of the 426 LSOA's in Suffolk.  Between 2005 to 2012 most LSOA‟s show some shifting of ranking amongst this top twenty LSOA‟s, moving up and down in their experience of reported Hate Crime prevalence relative to other LSOA‟s.  Hate Crimes tend to occur in LSOA's with multiple deprivation and high crime.  LSOA's with high concentrations of Hate Crime also have: lower levels of British White residents; higher levels of „White Other‟ residents; and higher levels of minority ethnic populations.   5.1 Introduction This chapter examines the geographical distribution of Hate Crimes in Suffolk in relation to:  The distribution of Hate Crime in Suffolk based on total recorded incidents between 2005 and 2012  The concentration Hate Crime incidents in relation to lower super output areas (LSOA's), these provide sub-ward geography (averaging approximately 1,500 people)30 and are designed to improve the reporting of small area statistics and provides the smallest available geographical unit for analysis.  Changes to the geographical distribution of Hate Crime between 2005 and 2012 Knowing where incidents take place may assist local agencies in determining where they should focus their services. Suffolk is a non-Metropolitan county, which has a County Council and seven Local Authority districts, (here ranked by population figures in brackets) being: Ipswich (133,384); Suffolk Coastal, (124,298); Waveney (115,254); St. Edmundsbury (111,008); Mid Suffolk, (96, 731); Babergh (87, 740); and Forest Heath (59,748).                                             29  LSOA's have a minimum 1000 population and 400 households and maximum 3000 populations and 1,200 household threshold. 30  LSOA's have a minimum 1000 population and 400 households and maximum 3000 populations and 1,200 household threshold.  38  5.2 Geographical distribution of Hate Crime across Suffolk Figure 5.1 maps the geo-coded locations of the Hate Crime or incident (depicted by purple circles) within Suffolk across the full police data from 2005 into 2012 overlaid by the conurbations and the road networks across the county.31  As might be expected this shows that Hate Crimes and incidents are concentrated throughout the major urban centres in Suffolk, notably Ipswich, Bury St. Edmonds, Lowestoft, Newmarket, Sudbury and Clare.  There is also further concentration throughout some of the outlying towns and into more rural areas.                Figure 5.1: The geographical distribution of Hate Crime across Suffolk (2005-2012)                                                31  Data from the 2011 Census, derived from the Suffolk Observatory  39  5.3  Geographical distribution of Hate Crime across Suffolk by lower super output areas The research team analysed the distribution of Hate Crime incidents 2005 to 2012 by the 426 lower super output areas (LSOA's) across Suffolk.  The results of this analysis are detailed in Table 5.1, which identifies and ranks the top 20 LSOA‟s in Suffolk that display the greatest concentration of Hate Crime and incidents. The table also highlights the corresponding number of Hate Crime/incidents which occur within the LSOA and the percentage relative to overall Hate Crime from 2005 and into 2012 (% Incidents) and the corresponding cumulative percentage of incidents and cumulative percentage of LOSA's.  The key findings from this analysis are:  The highest concentration of Hate Crime in Suffolk (with more than 10 per cent of all Hate Crime across the county) took place in one LSOA - Ipswich 007B, which is centrally located in the city  The top five LSOA‟s account for over 17 per cent of total Hate Crime and incidents in Suffolk yet constitute 1.2 per cent of all LSOA‟s in the county. Three are in Ipswich, the other two are in Bury St. Edmunds (St. Emundsbury 006A) and in Lowestoft (Waveney 007D) on the Suffolk coast.  The top ten LSOA‟s contributed to nearly a quarter (24 per cent) of all Hate Crime and incidents although this equates to less than 2.5 per cent of all LSOA's for Suffolk. The top ten LSOA‟s also includes several LSOA‟s in Mildenhall, Brandon (Forest Heath 001B and 007D).  Over a third (34 per cent) of all Hate Crime in Suffolk took place in twenty LSOA's which equates to less than 5 per cent of all LSOA's in Suffolk. The locations are detailed in Figure 5.2. Data on the remaining LSOA's have been „collapsed‟ and aggregated in the Table 5.1.

Table 5.2 ranks the earlier identified top 20 LSOA's in terms of their position in demarcating where the most Hate Crime occurs over a number of different time periods, including the complete 7 year period (first column) then over consecutive  two calendar  43  years, and finally (last column)  their average placing. For example, if ranked one the LSOA had the highest number of Hate Crime incidents in that time period, if ranked two the second highest of all LSOA areas, and so forth. Most LSOA‟s show some shifting of ranking amongst this top 20 LSOA‟s, moving up and down in their experience of reported Hate Crime prevalence relative to other LSOA‟s. Nevertheless, there is enough stability to introduce a ranking (colour coded as in Figure 5.4) across time periods. This sees three LSOA‟s (Ispwich 007B; Waveney 007D and St. Edmundsbury 006A) being in the top 10 LSOA‟s for Hate Crime across all time periods (appearing in red).  A further 8 LOSA‟s are mostly in the top 20, and these areas are spread across Ipswich, Bury St. Edmunds, Lowestoft, Mildenhall and Sudbury areas (appearing in yellow). A further three LOSA‟s (2 in Ipswich and one on Lowestoft) are mostly in this top 20 ranking, but in some calendar years prevalence drops.  The remaining LSOA‟s in this spatial typology follow a similar pattern and have been marked in Table 5.2 as grey or blue. They are in Ipswich (Ipswich 010B; 014A; and 014B) Bury ST. Edmunds, Lowestoft and Mildenhall (St. Edmonbury 006D Waveney 004C Forest Heath 007B). These have been categorised as either having a reducing or emerging concern due to the fluctuating levels of reported Hate Crime leading the LOSA to move into and out of the top 20 LOSA‟s for Hate Crime concentration. 5.4  Hate Crime, deprivation and geographical location These top twenty LSOA's for Hate Crimes (detailed above) also have very high deprivation and crimes scores (based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2010 at LSOA area level)32.  These LOSA‟s are also suffering high levels of volume crime more generally, and all are in the top 30 per cent of high crime areas based on IMD score for Suffolk.  There is a statistically significant correlation between deprivation (IMD 2010) and Hate Crime incidents (0.555, i.e. significant at 99 per cent). This implies Hate Crime incidents are more likely to occur in more deprived areas. In addition, the correlation between Hate Crime incidents and general crime levels (based on IMD scores for 2010) is 0.697 (significant at 99 per cent). This also suggests a high level of correlation between high crime areas and areas with Hate Crime incidents. 5.5 The Relationship between the Geography of Hate Crime and Ethnicity The research team examined the ethnic makeup of the LOSA‟s (based on the 2011 census) in relation to Hate Crime.  As might be expected, this analysis shows that LSOA's with high concentrations of Hate Crime also tend to have:  Lower levels of „British White‟ population than the Suffolk average which is 92.1 per cent British White (2011 census).  For example, LOSA Ipswich 006C has 56.6 per cent British White.                                              32  See http://opendatacommunities.org/datasets/imd-score-2010  44   Higher levels of „White Other‟ (likely to be from Eastern Europe), above the Suffolk average of 3.7 per cent. For example all of the following LOSAs have a „White Other‟ population of 10 per cent: St Edmundsbury 006A, Ipswich 006C, Ipswich 010E, Forest Heath 001B, Ipswich 012E and Forest Heath 007D  Have higher levels of minority ethnic groups, for example the average scores for Suffolk are 1.6 per cent mixed multi ethnic, 1.6 per cent Asian, 0.8 per cent Black African Caribbean and 0.3 per cent other ethnicity. For example, Ipswich 006C and Ipswich 010E have high figures for all these groups (5.4 and 5.6 per cent mixed multi ethnic, 8 and 8.4 per cent Asian, 4.9 and 6.5 per cent Black African Caribbean, and 5.3 and 1.8 per cent other ethnicity) 5.6 Changes over Time in the Spatial Distribution of Hate Crime There is visual evidence suggesting that the spatial distribution of Hate Crime has become less concentrated over time.  This may reflect improved levels of reporting in less urban LSOA areas. Figure 5.3 demonstrate this temporal change visually, it overlays incidents occurring in 2005 and 2006 in green, 2007 and 2008 in purple, 2009 and 2010 in blue and 2011 and 2012 in red.  2011-2012 Figure 5.3:  Changes in the geographical Location of Hate Crime between 2005 and 2012 in two year time periods  45  5.7 Modus operandi analysis The research team analysed the modus operandi (MO) and other descriptive details of offences across the police data from 2005 to 2012. This was undertaken through cluster analysis which allocates cases that use similar words to describe the MO to the same cluster. It can be inferred from this that the MOs in any given cluster refer to events that display similarities in the way in which the crime was committed or the incident occurred.  Further details of this methodology can be obtained from the research team. The key findings from the analysis depicted in Figure 5.4.  This shows eleven clusters and the relationships between them.  Each cluster is represented by a bubble, the size of the bubble indicates the number of cases assigned to that group – the larger the bubble the more cases.  Clusters that are close together on the chart have similarities in the combinations of words used by their cases which suggests linkages and relationships between them, whereas clusters that are further apart have less in common.  The clusters identified were:   Public spaces (658 cases) – clustered cases are generally cases of harassment occurring in public places including on the street, in parks etc.  Neighbours (648 cases) – clustered cases are predominantly cases of harassment or abuse occurring between neighbours on residential property.  Children/Family (253 cases) – clustered cases predominantly involve children and/or family members.  This includes cases where the victims are children, and cases between family members.  The above three clusters are close together in Figure 5.4  because they all predominantly involve varieties of verbal abuse and harassment although the locations and targets vary.  Service Industry (664 cases) – clustered cases are predominantly cases of harassment or abuse by customers against staff working in shops, cafes, takeaways and so on.   Night-time Economy (363) – clustered cases predominantly occur at night or in the early hours in and around pubs and nightclubs.  The above two clusters are close together in Figure 5.4 because the both involve types of verbal abuse and harassment. In both clusters staff are commonly the victim of abuse. However the Night-time Economy cluster also includes crimes/incidents where both offenders and victims are „revellers‟ and alcohol features more predominantly in the Night-time Economy cluster.   Police (361) – this cluster relates to incidents where in the course of intervening in another incident a police officer has become a victim of Hate crime.    Phone/Internet (466) – this cluster refers to victims who have received abusive messages via phones, mobile phones, email and social networking sites.  46   Assault (669) – cases involve physical assault which predominantly lead to injury.  Sexual assault (174) – cases involve sexual/indecent assault There is overlap between the assault and sexual assault clusters in Figure 9 because of the use of words pertaining to physical assault and physical contact.  Vehicles (633) – cases in this cluster relate predominantly to criminal damage to vehicles  Dwellings (316) – cases in this cluster relate to damage and theft from residential dwellings. The use of words pertaining to damage, property and theft in the above two clusters lead to them occupying a similar space in Figure 5.4.   Figure 5.4:  Cluster of Hate Crime modus operandi descriptions based on police data for 2005 to 2012.        47  5.8  Conclusion The geographical analysis of Hate Crimes indicates strong evidence for the spatial concentration of Hate Crime in Suffolk.  The top 10 LSOA's contributed to nearly a quarter of all Hate Crimes, yet they equate to less than 2.5 per cent of all LSOA's for Suffolk. Furthermore, 45 per cent of all Hate Crimes were in less than 10 per cent of all the LSOA's for Suffolk.  As may be expected, Hate Crimes are concentrated throughout urban centres in Suffolk, notably Ipswich, Bury St. Edmonds, Lowestoft, Newmarket and Sudbury, with the exception of one LOSA area (Forest Heath 001B which was classified as Town and Fringe) all the top 20 LOSA's are classified as Urban areas. There is further concentration throughout the outlying towns and into more rural areas.  In addition these specific locations also carry a number of criminogenic characteristics conducive to Hate Crime, with the top 20 LSOA areas all having very high IMD scores, with all being in the top 30 per cent of high crime areas (based on IMD score for Suffolk).  Rather interestingly, many of the LSOA areas also have lower numbers of British White population than the Suffolk average (92.1 per cent) for example, Ipswich 006C has 56.6 per cent British White and these areas also tend to have higher levels of 'White other' populations in addition to higher levels of minority ethnic groups.  Very likely there is a prominent role to the night time economy here in the city and town centres, and how some young people use public space, but in addition one possible hypothesis to explain this the changing pattern of racial composition and traditions of 'defensive territoriality' that can characterize some communities, notably the indigenous white population perceiving to be threatened by encroachment from new arriving populations.  This is given more credence from observation of the visual evidence from the GIS mapping exercise which suggests that the spatial distribution of Hate Crime incidents has become less concentrated over time.  This is further supported by examining the total extent of all Hate Crime areas (what percentage of LSOA areas does all Hate Crime occur). In 2005/2006 all of the Hate Crime incidents occurred in 53 per cent of all LSOA areas (47 per cent had no incidents), in 2007/08 figure this was 65 per cent (35 per cent LSOA areas had no incidents), in 2009/2010 77 per cent (27 per cent of LSOA areas had no incidents), and 2011/12 100 per cent of Hate Crime incidents occurred at 70 per cent of all LSOA areas (30 per cent had no incidents).  This shows that the concentration of Hate Crimes in these top 20 LSOA areas has been reducing over time.  This finding is in line with a recent report on racial violence by the Institute of Race Relations (Racial violence; facing reality 2013) which found that racial attacks on BME individuals were spreading to new areas of the country which have little experience of diversity, in part as a result of austerity measures and the effects of globalisation prompting swifter population changes.  However, it is beyond the remit of this project to authoritatively answer this question within Suffolk.  It should also be noted that this dispersal of Hate Crime may also reflect improved levels of reporting in some less urban LSOA areas, itself reflecting the activities of local agencies.  Whilst racial bias comprises the most frequent motivation for Hate Crime in Suffolk, it is only a proportion of Hate Crime.  The emerging picture from several other equality strands demonstrated some disturbing trends.  As we have rehearsed in our earlier discussion, there is some evidence that inaccurate recording by some police officers of flagged hate offences for sexuality and also disability at least partially explains some of the sharp  48  increases here.  The question that cannot be answered is the extent to which these data quality issues account for the entire fluctuations in the data. Suffolk police are aware of these recording problems, but they are difficult to address retrospectively.  Their own upgrading of IT systems presents an opportunity to introduce tighter auditing procedures for such flagged offences, and improved staff training in accurate data inputting.  Whilst these developments are important for strategy planning within Suffolk, the more fundamental problems lie in the consistent problem of under reporting, to either the police or victim advocacy organisations.       49  6. The enforcement and support needs of victims of Hate Crime  Key findings  Survey respondents indicated high levels of awareness about the police and Doctors/GPs, although some of these respondents also indicated that they were not aware of what they did (in relation to Hate Crime).  Survey respondents drawn from vulnerable communities were more likely to be aware of the organisations that worked with their communities, however, the level of awareness varied considerably; some organisations were better known by their target community than others.  Survey respondents indicated that the agencies they were most likely to contact to seek assistance with Hate Crime were (in rank order), the police, ISCRE and Doctor/GP.  For those choosing the police and Doctor/GP, the primary reason given was that they had previously received assistance from them in relation to Hate Crime and other matters.  For ISCRE, the reason was that they would “understand what I‟m going through”.  The most popular organisational attributes chosen by survey respondents were: understanding the individual‟s needs and those of their community; can act quickly; can take action against the perpetrators.  Survey respondents wanted to be informed about Hate Crime Services through traditional means such as: leaflets to the home, local newspapers and through community groups and meetings.  The survey findings suggested a tension between individuals wishing to report Hate Crimes anonymously and their desire for firm action by the police  Survey respondents preferred to report Hate Crime by speaking to someone in person or by telephone.  Survey respondents expected the police to catch and convict perpetrators for all Hate Crime although there was a lowered expectation in relation to less serious Hate Crime.  The survey findings indicate there may be an inverse relationship (in respondents‟ expectations of the police) between the police taking firm action and the sensitivity with which they handle the case.   Victims of Hate Crime have generic support needs, however they also have support needs which are specific to their community group  There is a need to develop an integrated Hate Crime service provision which plays to the strengths of different agencies.  Agencies need to streamline the provision of services to victims by agreeing and providing a case management/case co-ordination to broker support/assistance tailored to the needs of victims.  The survey findings should be treated with caution as they are based on a relatively small sample of respondents.      50  6.1  Introduction This chapter focuses on the enforcement and support needs of victims of Hate Crime drawing findings principally from the Suffolk Hate Crime Survey and community interviews and focus groups.  It covers:  Respondents‟ awareness of the organisations which provide Hate Crime support in Suffolk  Which agency individuals were likely to contact for support or assistance with Hate Crime and why  The organisational attributes which respondents felt were most important  Respondents‟ preferences in relation to ways in which they wanted to receive information about Hate Crime services  Respondent‟s preferences in relation to reporting Hate Crimes anonymously and the ways in which respondents‟ preferred to report these  Expectations of the types of actions that the police should take in relation to Hate Crime  A summary of the different needs of the equality groups/communities which are vulnerable to Hate Crime  An identification of gaps in existing Hate Crime service provision 6.2  Awareness of support organisations across Suffolk Suffolk Hate Crime Survey respondents were asked to select from three possible responses - either that they had heard of the organisation and knew what they did; or that they were aware of the organisation but were unsure of what they did; or that they had not heard of them.  Not all respondents answered the question; and the number of respondents varied between organisations. Respondents were given a list of 14 organisations. These were:  Avenues Group  JIMAS  Victim Support  Suffolk, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Network  One Voice For Travellers  Ipswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality (ISCRE)  Suffolk Police  Local Authority  Housing Association  Suffolk Hate Crime Service  Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership  Doctor/G.P  Community practitioners (social worker, community care/mental health team)  Other national organisations (Citizens Advice Bureau, Samaritans)  51  As expected, high numbers of respondents were aware of the following (mainly public sector agencies) - Suffolk Police (91 per cent); Doctor/GP (89 per cent); Community Practitioners (72 per cent); Other National Organisations (70 per cent); Local Authority (68 per cent); Housing Association (69 per cent). There were some anomalies however.  For example 7 per cent answered that they had heard of Suffolk Police but were not sure what they did. Similarly 8 per cent of respondents had heard of the Doctor/GP but were not sure what they did.  This may, for example, reflect a lack of awareness about how the Police and Doctor/GP are involved with Hate Crime.   Table 6.1 details the responses of survey participants to seven organisations that work with communities vulnerable to Hate Crime, the Suffolk Hate Crime Service and the Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership.  It should be noted that the survey was promoted by these agencies to individuals within their communities. Table 6.1:  Suffolk Hate Crime Survey - Awareness of organisations that work with communities vulnerable to Hate Crime Organisation I have heard of them and I know what they do I have heard of them but I do not know what they do I have not heard of them Avenues Group (Base = 157) 35% (55) 17% (26) 48% (76) JIMAS (Base = 159) 40% (63) 13% (20) 48% (76) Victim Support  (Base = 165) 48% (80) 15% (25) 36% (60) Suffolk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Network (Base = 153) 30% (46) 13% (20) 57% (87) One Voice For Travellers (Base = 157) 40% (63) 7% (11) 53% (83) Ipswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality (ISCRE) (Base = 161) 46% (74) 15% (24) 39% (63) Suffolk Hate Crime Service (Base = 161) 46% (74) 16% (25) 39% (62) Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership (Base = 158) 37% (58) 16% (26) 47% (74)   52  Of these, the three most well-known organisations were Victim support, the Suffolk Hate Crime Service and ISCRE (63 per cent, 62 per cent and 61 per cent had heard of them whether they knew what they did or not).  Agencies which arguably worked with smaller communities such as the Suffolk, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Network and One Voice For Travellers were less well known. In order to test this, the research team analysed the responses to agency awareness by vulnerable communities to see if respondents were aware of organisations which worked specifically with their communities.  The findings for each organisation are as follows:  One Voice For Travellers - the Gypsy Traveller group made up the greatest proportion of respondents who knew of the organisation and were aware of what they did (43 respondents or 69 per cent of respondents who had heard of the organisation and knew what they did).    Avenues Group - Analysis was carried out looking at whether or not people had a disability.  Of those people who considered themselves to have a disability, 57 per cent indicated they had heard of them and knew what they did; 14 per cent had heard of them but did not know what they did; and 29 per cent had not heard of them.    Suffolk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender network - 13 respondents indicated that their gender identity differed from that assigned at birth.  Of these respondents, 2 had heard of the network and 7 had not heard of them.  The awareness responses were analysed for sexual orientation. 10 respondents who identified themselves as Gay or bisexual had heard of the Suffolk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Network and knew what they did and 1 had heard of them but was not sure of what they did.  5 respondents who said they were gay or bisexual had not heard of them.  JIMAS - 71 per cent of respondents who identified themselves as being of Muslim faith had heard of JIMAS and knew what they did; 23 per cent (or 10 respondents) had not heard of the organisation. The above findings are based on relatively small numbers so should be treated with caution, however they suggest that there is variation in the level of awareness of individuals who are arguably the target group for the organisations.  Organisations may need to review their communication strategy with their target audience to raise awareness about themselves first and foremost in order that this can then be followed with communications around the organisation‟s Hate Crime support function. 6.3  Likelihood of contacting agencies for assistance/support The Suffolk Hate Crime Survey participants were asked to indicate which agencies they would contact if they were a victim or witness of Hate Crime.  The key findings are:  The police were the agency that most respondents would contact, 62 per cent of 156 respondents indicated they would be very likely/quite likely to contact them.  53   ISCRE was ranked second with 41 per cent of 135 respondents indicating that they would very likely/quite likely to contact them.  Doctor/GP was the agency which was ranked third (at 39 per cent of 140 respondents), followed by the Hate Crime Service (38 per cent of 139 respondents) and One Voice For Travellers (38 per cent of 122 respondents)   The local authority was indicated by 35 per cent of 139 respondents and housing association by 25 per cent of 132 respondents. A further analysis of this question was done by selecting only the respondents who had answered \"Yes they had heard of an organisation and they knew what they did\".  When selecting only these cases, there was very little difference in terms of number of responses; this suggests that people are more likely to contact an organisation if they are aware of that organisation and know what it does. Survey participants were asked to indicate why they would contact their preferred agencies if they were a victim or witness of Hate Crime.  The key findings are:  29 per cent of 110 respondents who had indicated that they would contact the police did so because they had been helped by the police in the past with a Hate Crime or incident, 13 per cent of 110 respondents indicated that they would contact them because of they had been helped by the police with another matter.  This indicates that while they were reservations from some survey respondents, community interviewees and focus groups attendees about reporting to the police as detailed in Chapter 4, other respondents had had a positive experience.  Perhaps surprisingly, 35 per cent of 77 respondents who indicated that they would contact the Doctor/GP did so because they had been helped in the past with a Hate Crime.  Given that Doctors/GPs do not provide dedicated Hate Crime support this suggests that individuals had at some point received some support or assistance from them which individuals found positive.  This suggests there is a role for Doctors/GPs and perhaps other health professionals in providing support to victims and other individuals affected by Hate Crime.   The most frequently cited reason for contacting One Voice for Travellers and ISCRE was \"because I knew that they would understand what I am going through\", respectively, 78 per cent of 54 respondents and 34 per cent of 59 respondents.  For the Suffolk Hate Crime Service, Avenues Group, JIMAS, Victim Support and Suffolk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Network, the most popular reason selected for contacting these organisations was that the respondent had been told to by another organisation  6.4  The attributes of organisations which provide services to victims of Hate Crime Suffolk Hate Crime Survey respondents were asked to identify which attribute they felt was the most important when thinking of organisations which offer support or help with Hate  54  Crime.  Respondents were asked to select three things which were most important to them, however, some respondents only ticked one option, and others ticked more than three. The full results are contained in Figure 6.1.  This shows that the three most frequently cited organisational attributes were in rank order:  Understands people's specific needs or the specific needs of their community (121 respondents)  Can respond quickly (69 respondents)  Can take action against the person/people who committed the crime (65 respondents) Less importance was placed on an organisation being near to the respondent's home, or an organisation which could provide personal support.   55    Figure 6.1:  Suffolk Hate Crime Survey – Favoured organisational attributes (based on response count)  121 69 65 47 42 37 33 020406080100120140Organisation whichunderstands my specificneeds/need of my communityOrganisation/service that canrespond quicklyOrganisation/service which cantake action against theperson/people who committedthe crimeOrganisation /service which isavaiable 24 hours a day 7 days aweekOrganisation/service thatspecialises in HateCrime/IncidentsOrganisation/service which isnear to my homeOrganisation/service which canprovide me with personalsupport (e.g. Buddies) 56  6.5  Communication with individuals about Hate Crime services Suffolk Hate Crime Survey respondents were asked to indicate ways in which they wanted to be informed about Hate Crime services from a range of ten options.  The three most popular options were: leaflets to my home; local newspapers; and community groups and meetings.  The least favoured option was by text. Figure 6.2 details the full range of options ranked in relation to the number of respondents who chose them.  6.6  Anonymous reporting The Suffolk Hate Crime Survey asked participants if they would be more or less likely to report Hate Crimes if this could be done anonymously. 143 respondents answered this question.  Around two-thirds of respondents (66 per cent) stated that they would be more likely to report being a victim or witness of Hate Crime if they could remain anonymous.  By comparison a third (35 per cent) answered No or Don't Know.  A total of 51 people did not answer this question.   The two reasons most frequently given for anonymous reporting were: not wanting anyone to know that they had reported the incident (23 per cent of 138 responses); and fear of reprisal (22 per cent of 138 responses). It should be noted that 7 out of 10 respondents (71 per cent of 114 respondents) who had previously been a victim or witness of Hate Crime indicated that they would be more likely to report Hate Crime if they could remain anonymous.  This represents a slightly higher proportion than for all respondents to the question. These findings for anonymous reporting need to be treated with caution.  They perhaps reflect the reasons and concerns identified in Chapter 4 for the non- reporting of Hate Crime.  However, they need to be considered alongside other findings.  Survey respondents also indicated (see 6.8) that a high level of expectation is placed on the police in relation to the types of action that respondents want them to take in relation to serious and less serious Hate Crimes.  Clearly, if incidents are not reported to the police, then any potential actions cannot be enacted by them. This suggests a tension between individuals wishing to report anonymously and their desire for firm action by the police.  A tension which is not easily resolvable. 6.7 Ways to report Hate Crime Suffolk Hate Crime Survey respondents were asked to identify which way they would prefer to report a Hate Crime/Incident.  They were provided with a tick list of options and asked to select one response only.  The options and response rates are detailed in Figure 6.3.   57   Figure 6.2:  Suffolk Hate Crime Survey – Options for communicating about Hate Crime services (response count)    58   Figure 6.3:  Suffolk Hate Crime Survey – Options for reporting Hate Crimes 59  The most popular response option selected was \"I would prefer to speak to someone in person\" with 79 respondents selecting this option.  The second most popular response was \"I would prefer to report the incident by telephone\" with 31 respondents selecting this.  18 respondents answered \"I don't mind\" and 11 respondents said they didn't know.  For all other possible ways in which to report a Hate Crime/Incident, less than 10 respondents selected these.  This indicates that the options for reporting through modern technology, such as by text, through a website or by email were not popular with respondents.  Some studies (such as Wong and Christmann 2008) indicated that the process of receiving an immediate response directly from another person was an important requirement of the reporting process.  The technology options do not offer this. 6.8 Expectations of the police in response to Hate Crime Suffolk Hate Crime Survey respondents were asked to identify what they would expect the police to do if they reported a Hate Crime incident, they were able to choose more than one action.  In addition the responses were in relation to a number of different Hate Crime incidents.  The collated responses are detailed in Table 6.2. Table 6.2:  Suffolk Hate Crime Survey – Actions that respondents expected the police to take in relation to different types of Hate Crimes  Catch and convict the person who did it Provide me with equipment to protect myself Give me advice on how to protect myself Be sympathetic and sensitive Provide me with equipment to detect the person who did it Do nothing Direct me to extra support (e.g. counselling, Hate Crime Buddies) Inappropriate Humour 54 9 25 47 6 37 32 Non Physical Abuse 83 14 27 40 9 13 34 Physical abuse or violence 119 25 29 34 14 5 27 Damage to home or property 123 15 28 33 18 5 23 Theft/robbery 115 23 31 31 17 6 25 Other discrimination 45 8 22 27 4 5 25  Catching and convicting the perpetrator was the most favoured police action across all types of Hate Crimes.  This was higher (between 115 and 123 responses) for more serious crimes such as: damage to home or property; physical abuse or violence; and theft/robbery and lower for a less serious crime such as non-physical abuse (83 responses).  This suggests a degree of realism by respondents in terms of a graded response from police in relation to seriousness of crime/incident.  60  However, it should also be noted that respondents indicated that the police should also catch and convict in relation to incidents of inappropriate humour (54 responses) and other discrimination (45 responses).  It should be noted that this last issue is not within the remit of the police.  However, it perhaps serves as an indicator of the unrealistic expectations that the public have of the police. These survey findings highlight the mismatch between respondents‟ expectations about the type of action that they would like the police to take and the action that the police are likely and able to take. This mismatch was identified through the community interviews and focus groups. Some interviewees who had been through the process of convicting the perpetrator for Hate Crime were disappointed with the outcome.  Their experiences are illustrated by the following observations.  \"The perpetrator got a caution- we are still being punished\"  (Community interview)  \"The end bit is the hardest- as the issue is often not resolved- the carer still needs a break, the Hate Crime is still there- the perpetrator is still out there\"   (Community interview)  \"The expectation is that something will be done- and we are always disappointed\"   (Community interview)  \"The police/authorities make promises, but don’t do anything\"   (Community interview) One Disability support agency highlighted that they often found it difficult to manage realistic expectations around the potential outcomes of Hate Crime reporting, as victims were often not happy with results.  For the vast majority, the wrong doing did not result in a prison sentence or the perpetrator being removed; thereby meaning that for some, the issue was not resolved.  As one agency representative noted:  61  “[The Hate Crime] may indeed continue to occur and this can leave victims with a sense of frustration and they are often left feeling unsafe in their own homes and communities’  (Disability support Agency) There is clearly a need for the police and other agencies involved in delivering Hate Crime services to manage the expectations of the public, to avoid the potential for disappointment and disenchantment which could feed into reasons for not reporting future incidents to the police.  This is captured in the following observation from a survey respondent. “I need clarity as regards whether verbal abuse about someone behind their back, on one to one conversations with others can be followed through and the guilty party punished as appropriate.”   (Survey respondent) A further finding from the survey responses which should be noted was that the police being sympathetic and sensitive to the victim was important to respondents, although less important than catching and convicting the perpetrator.  This may suggest that by dealing with a Hate Crime case with sympathy and sensitivity along with close management of the victim‟s expectations could provide victims with a more positive experience, as indicated by the following observation. “When I reported an incident to the police in Suffolk, they were very good. They clearly weren’t specialist, or had even had much training, but the two women officers were prompt to attend, were sensitive and spent a bit of time with me. The follow up was also quite good, looking at ID photos and the like.” (Survey respondent) The survey responses indicated that being sympathetic and sensitive appeared to be less important for serious Hate Crimes, 31 responses for theft and robbery compared with 47 for inappropriate humour.  This may indicate that respondents understand there may be an inverse relationship between the police taking firm action and the sensitivity with which the case is handled. Additional support The option of the police referring individuals for additional support was ranked the third or fourth most requested response, although (as with being sympathetic and sensitive) this was considerably less requested than catching and convicting the perpetrator. The police currently refer individuals for additional support.  The following data detailed in Table 6.3 has been provided by Suffolk Constabulary for the months of January and February 2013.  This indicates that the majority of victims (at the point of being asked by the police) are agreeable to making their details available to other agencies who could provide additional support. However, it has not been possible to determine how many of  62  the individuals who gave consent then went on to utilise the additional support. However, tracking take up and attrition rates (through the process) may be a useful way of gauging this demand. The current referral arrangements are as described by Suffolk Constabulary Diversity Team. “Victims are asked by the investigating officer if they object or consent to their details being passed to five different organisations – Housing, Education, Social Services, ISCRE and SHCS; for the first three, the investigating officers will liaise direct with the organisation concerned. For SHCS and ISCRE specific information is downloaded and sent to them so that they are able (if consent is given) to work with and support the victim directly and separately from the police. There are specific information sharing agreements with ISCRE and SHCS. ISCRE support and help victims of racial incidents only and so only details of racial incident victims are sent to them. SHCS, however, work with and support victims of all five strands and so details of all Hate Crime/incident victims are shared with them.”   Table 6.3: Suffolk Constabulary – Referrals for additional Hate Crime support January to February 2013 Type of incident by equality strand Total no. of incidents No. of victims who agreed to share details No. of victims who did not agree to share details Permission screens not completed Racial 71 46 to SHCS 48 to ISCRE 16 to both SHCS and ISCRE 2 to SHCS  5 Disabilist 13 10 to SHCS  3 Sexual orientation 13 9 to SHCS 3  1 Faith 4 2 to SHCS 1 1 Transgender 5* 4 to SHCS   *The 5th victim had not been asked as the investigation was still on going  6.9 The specific needs of vulnerable communities Findings from the community interviews and focus groups and the literature review strongly indicate that each of the communities which are vulnerable to Hate Crime have specific support needs. These have been summarised in Table 6.4, with more details provided in Appendix 1. This indicates that a one size fits all approach to Hate Crime Service provision would be inappropriate, however, the extent to which services can be tailored to individual communities is dependent on available resources.    63  Table 6.4: A summary of the specific support needs of individuals from different vulnerable communities Race Gypsy Travellers Faith Sexual Orientation Gender Identity Disability Language support  Within community facilitated awareness of HC procedures/ support  More positive contact with police Building a relationship with the police  Within community facilitated interaction with police Restorative Justice- so can tell perpetrator how it makes you feel  Acknowledgement of wrong doing Support that acknowledges that family support may not be available  Having access to someone who knows the procedures  Being kept informed by the police  Acknowledgement of wrong doing  Support that acknowledges that family support may not be available  Privacy guaranteed should it go to court. Screens etc.  Within community facilitated awareness of HC procedures/ support  More general sessions 'taking care' of 'oneself' and 'real friends' 6.10  Gaps in existing provision The findings from the community interviews and focus groups and Suffolk Hate Crime Survey suggest a limited awareness and understanding of the range of services that were available to victims, family members and witnesses of Hate Crime.  This in part reflect the limited experience that some community participants had with agencies other than the police, the Suffolk Hate Crime Service and the community groups that they were in contact with. The identification about gaps in existing provision are principally drawn from interviews with representatives from agencies involved with the Hate Crime Partnership.  The key findings are:  There is a need to develop an integrated service provision which plays to the strengths of different agencies, e.g. in relation to being able to take enforcement action, or provide specialist community appropriate support  Agencies need to streamline the provision of services to victims by agreeing and providing a case management/case co-ordination to broker support/assistance tailored to the needs of victims.  This function could be undertaken by a public or VCS agency, however the critical issue is that whoever takes this role needs to have sufficient capacity to address the victim‟s need for continuity and updating on progress.  A need for a performance management framework which agencies buy into and can provide a means of assessing success and effectiveness across all agencies involved in providing services to Hate Crime victims, families and witnesses.  64   Overcoming obstacles/reservations to the sharing of information between agencies.  This may be due to issues of confidentiality or protectionism.  Mainstreaming and fully utilising innovations that have been developed – e.g. buddies.  There appeared to limited evidence that the buddies schemes had been utilised by Hate Crime victims.  6.11 Conclusion The findings indicate that the enforcement and support needs of Hate Crime victims are necessarily straightforward.  They can be contradictory such as wishing to report Hate Crimes anonymously while at the same time expressing a preference for robust action to be taken against perpetrators.  In part these contradictions appear to be manifestations of the lack of understanding on the part of Hate Crime victims and individuals from communities vulnerable to Hate Crime about their role in the process of enabling action to be taken in response to a Hate Crime and the expectations that they have about the types of actions that the police and other agencies can take and the likely outcomes of these actions, in relation for example to successful prosecutions. The role of the police and other agencies (particularly those who work closely with the vulnerable communities) in managing the expectations of victims and potential victims is important.  While agencies are keen to encourage and promote and the reporting of the Hate Crime, they need to ensure that they do not „over-sell‟ the benefits that the victim or potential victims will derive from this.  They need to develop a narrative or message which captures this in order to avoid disappointment and scepticism about the efficacy of approaching services.  The findings suggest that the way in which victims of Hate Crime are treated before, during and after their involvement in the criminal justices system is as important as the criminal justice system outcome itself.   There appear to be a plethora of services and agencies which are willing to assist victims of Hate Crime.  However, the very number of agencies and the particular specialism and/or enforcement and support function that they can provide to victims in some instances it may be a barrier to victims receiving an effective service – victims are unclear about who can deal with what.  Critical to improving the effectiveness of Hate Crime service provision and the experience of victims is a greater level of integration between services driven by a case management approach with victims being assigned a case manager who can broker a package of support (from the appropriate agencies) tailored to the victim‟s needs.  Models of this case management approach exist for the management of prolific offenders managed under Integrated Offender Management (IOM) arrangements.  This should be adopted for Hate Crime victims.  Drawing on IOM models (Senior et al 2011 and Wong et al 2012) the case manager (or lead professional) could be from a public agency (such as the Suffolk Hate Crime Service)  for more complex cases with the case manager for less complex cases being drawn from a VCS agency that has sufficient capacity to provide this.    65  7. Recommendations This final chapter focusses on the recommendations.  The past experience of the research team suggests that rather than produce a long detailed „wish list‟ of recommendations that may be difficult to implement, it is more helpful to local agencies to home in on a smaller number of recommendations which they can own and which can they can deliver. The recommendations presented below address the key issues identified in the previous chapters and offer operational and strategic solutions to them. It is recommended that the Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership work with its public, private and voluntary and community sector partners to:  Implement the framework for generic Hate Crime Service provision detailed in 7.1.  Use the performance framework detailed in 7.2 to agree appropriate metrics which all the agencies involved in delivering Hate Crime services in Suffolk should sign up to deliver.   Use the service planning framework contained in Appendix 1 to enhance the delivery of community/equality strand specific Hate Crime Services   7.1 Framework for generic Hate Crime Service provision Analysis of the data from the agency interviews, community interviews and focus groups suggests the following generic (i.e. across all vulnerable groups) framework for Hate Crime service provision detailed in Table 7.1.  The framework enables local agencies to provide a scaled response according the needs of the individual.  This should enable local agencies to target their limited resources more effectively. The community interviews and focus group findings indicate that some individuals have effective personal support structures (from families and friends) and therefore need less support from agencies.  Building the resilience of individuals and enabling them to build up personal support structures (where these may not exist) may provide a more cost effective long term solution, rather than agency dependency.          66  Table 7.1: Proposed framework for Hate Crime Service provision Service stages Key service objective Key service elements across all the stages Pre-incident  Providing targeted information to individuals who may be vulnerable to Hate Crime  Information initiatives targeted at potential perpetrators to deter or prevent Hate Crimes occurring  Case co-ordination by a „lead professional‟ (from a public or VCS agency) who is responsible for managing the individual‟s case at each or any of these stages  A risk of victimisation and needs assessment process that is applied to each case  A scaled response to each case based on a red, amber, green (RAG) system of risk of victimisation and need (similar to that adopted for the management of prolific offenders) which ensures that community specific support (where required) is provided  A regular case conference and review process (as adopted for the management of prolific offenders) involving all the key criminal justice and voluntary sector agencies  Pre-reporting to the police  Recording information about Hate Crimes from individuals who do not feel comfortable/confident to report this to the police  Working with individuals and communities so that they feel able to report incidents to the police  Reporting to the police  Supporting individuals report Hate Crime to the police  Managing the expectations of individuals about the types of action that the police can take  Criminal justice System  Supporting individuals through the criminal justice system, managing their expectations through this process  Protecting individuals from reprisals Post criminal justice system  Providing „aftercare‟ support and protection to individuals whether or not perpetrators are convicted  7.2  Hate Crime Services Performance Framework Effective Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) should be driven by clear organisational objectives and derived directly from stakeholders to ensure that they are meaningful and that there is a sense of ownership and buy in from the organisations involved.  As part of the stakeholder workshop, the research team undertook a session with key organisations and stakeholders during which they were asked to indicate their objectives and, from these, derive a workable set of KPIs which were common across agencies.  They also attempted to identify what data (including baseline data) would be required in order to measure progress against these KPIs.  As expected, there was a high degree of commonality between the objectives of individual organisations in relation to Hate Crime and in the resulting KPIs.  It was not always possible within the workshop to establish appropriate measurements (e.g. what percentage of improvement would be expected; over what time  67  period etc.) but the framework provided should be used by agencies in Suffolk to facilitate the agreement of appropriate metrics. The performance framework in Table 7.2 therefore indicates the key objectives, the related KPI and the indicative data requirements.  Table 7.2: Hate Crime Services Performance Framework Objective KPI Data Requirement To increase awareness of Hate Crime in the community as a whole Community awareness of Hate Crime increased  within 12 months Baseline community survey; follow up community survey after 12 months To encourage and support victims of Hate Crime in making an informed decision about reporting Increase in numbers by of Hate Crimes which result in reporting  Increased numbers of reports via 3rd party centres Data is already captured on the HCS database.  This can be used to establish the current baseline and measure progress against target.  It may also be possible to examine this data over particular time periods which have coincided with increased activity to encourage reporting to help to assess the effectiveness of particular activities.  To provide effective support to victims throughout the criminal justice process Increased victim satisfaction at key points throughout the process There are existing victim satisfaction surveys undertaken by Police though participants were unclear as to the extent to which these would measure satisfaction amongst victims of Hate Crime or identify the kinds of support provided.  Individual agencies should be encouraged to develop consistent victim satisfaction surveys so that data can be aggregated across agencies. Establish common, consistent reporting processes and procedures for reporting across all agencies Single reporting process No specific data requirement; a review of current processes should be undertaken, followed by a consultation process to reach an agreed standard process/procedure To establish a single, consistent approach to the case management of Hate Crime cases based on complexity of the victim needs Consistent case management approach across all agencies No specific data requirement; a review of current processes should be undertaken, followed by a consultation process to reach an agreed standard process/procedure To pilot an effective counselling service for victims Pilot service developed  Effectiveness to be Will require the creation of a distance travelled tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the service – to be measured at the start and end  68  Objective KPI Data Requirement measured by improvements in well-being and other indicators   of engagement To establish effective and consistent partnership working  Achievement of common reporting and case management functions across all agencies  Number of organisations  attending  more than 75% of partnership meetings See above     Consistent monitoring of organisational attendance at meetings To establish an effective buddies system Number of buddies trained  Number of client referrals to buddy scheme  User satisfaction This will require data to be captured on numbers trained, and referred into the scheme.  It is recommended that a target is set for these by agreement with appropriate agencies To increase understanding of Hate Crime amongst children and young people Number of events undertaken by agencies  in school and youth arenas  Impact on/satisfaction of participants in these events Where possible, a unified programme of activity would ensure a consistent message.  As a minimum, agencies need to capture data on their activities in a consistent way to enable aggregation across the service.  This includes consistent  measurement of user impact and satisfaction    69  References ACPO (2010) Total of recorded hate crime from regional forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland during the calendar year 2009.

In addition the right column of the table highlights potential service options that may address the problems identified. It is recommended that these options are considered by agencies in Suffolk, in relation to feasibility, ease of implementation and the availability of resources to implement them.      79  Table A1.1: Service planning framework for Hate Crime victims based on race, affiliation to faith, sexuality, gender identify and disability  Key findings from the  literature review, community interviews and focus groups Further queries that arise from the findings Service Design Options  Product/ Service planning  Race Hate Crime There are marked differences between individuals in relation to how long the worst effects take to wear off: one fourth stated they wore off after a few hours; one quarter after a few days; half stated the effects continued for a long time (Bowling 1999).  A significant number of incidents take place at home or on property. Chahal and Julienne (1999) found that racist harassment took the form of: racist abuse, intimidation, throwing litter/eggs at property, physical attacks, knocking/kicking doors, racist graffiti, threats, bullying, car attacked, deliberate noise, spitting on a person, racist telephone calls, throwing stones, offensive material through letterbox, damage to property (doors windows, gardens) animal faeces smeared at the door, house broken into.  Children from ethnic minorities are more likely to experience bullying than their white counterparts (Barter 1999).  Do these differences relate to the type of incidents, self-esteem of the individual, socio economic status of the individual, lifestyle of the individual?  Has there been lifestyle profiling of victims of race Hate Crime?  How soon after an incident does reporting take place?  What service/benefit can be provided to those for whom the effects wear off after a few hours that would motivate them to report the incident/approach a service.  Is it possible to offer an at home/property preventative service as part of a general crime prevention service for vulnerable areas. Product/ Service planning  Rural Racism and Hate Crime  BME people living in low density ethnic areas may be greater risk than in larger ethnic minority population areas.

Quantitative comparison group studies showed an overall negative impact on victims compared to victims of non-hate motivated crimes (Willis 2004,  Harek et al 1997).  Victims who are in the early stages of coming out are unlikely to have the social support and strongly developed gay identity that can increase their psychological resilience and coping skills (Garnet 1992) Victims may feel less able to deal with post-victimisation reactions as a consequence of being unable to express their sexuality (Tyrer 2000). Young gay men who experience emotional abuse are one of the most at risk groups amongst teenage suicides in the UK (Morrison and Mackay, 2000). For LGBT youth there are additional effects of victimisation (Galop 1998,  Services need to provide support which enhances self-worth and gay/lesbian identity.  Services to those who have not come out must address these support needs in addition to those of a Hate Crime victim.  Services need to be designed to meet the diverse needs of LGBT youth.   83   Key findings from the  literature review, community interviews and focus groups Further queries that arise from the findings Service Design Options  Stormbreak 2005)  including: internalised oppression such as self-hatred, hatred of lesbians and gay men, crisis of faith.  Verbal abuse are the most common forms of victimisation of lesbians and gay men; the psychological effects of verbal abuse may be as severe as those following physical assault and possibly more insidious (Garnets et al 1992).  Product/ Service planning  Transphobic crime: Support Needs Experience victimisation through on-going discrimination, plus more visible as a group and therefore greater target. Can often lose their family support network, their home and also their friendship circles when transitioning. Trans people display heightened crime fear in public spaces. Many trans women and LGB sought support from outside the police (personal contact,  or authority figure at work or education). Women primarily seeking sympathy, advice and support, commonly from another lesbian/ gay, transsexual or transgender person. Women report low levels of satisfaction with police response to incidents, wide range of explanations given, but figure high level distrust of police. Women generally more comfortable talking to an LGBT officer or seeking support from an LGBT organisation.   Product/ Service planning  Rural racism: Support Needs Some non-English speaking victims required better translation services and more assistance with language difficulties. Access to staff who were of the same ethnic group as the victim.    84   Key findings from the  literature review, community interviews and focus groups Further queries that arise from the findings Service Design Options  Product/ Service planning  Traveller and Gypsy: Support Needs Little if any information on victim support needs.  Historically poor relations with the police, notably „new Travellers‟.   Develop outreach work and services to advise on their legal rights. Tenancy support for newly accommodated Gypsies and Travellers in housing. Develop peer mentoring networks to link longer-term housed Gypsies and Travellers. Product/ Service planning  People with a disability: Support Needs High levels of victimisation perpetrated by someone close to them, a friend or colleague, or harassment from a teacher or carer. Can lead to more profound impact on individual, especially mental health. Bullying is embarrassing and humiliating and undermines the self-confidence of people with a learning disability and the confidence of their carer‟s, family and friends.  It adds to feelings of being different and isolated that the majority of people with learning disability already experience (Mencap 1999a). Disabled victims receive unsatisfactory responses from statutory agencies following the reporting of Hate Crime. Disabled people tend to have lower levels of confidence in the criminal justice system (Quarmby, 2008) and of bad experiences of reporting. Police forces can also make ill-informed judgements about disabled people and how best to respond to them as a result of stereotypes and a lack of awareness about individual needs. Ethnic minority disabled people‟s lives are compartmentalised by agencies and individuals into separate and discreet issues, they therefore  Needs to provide support which enhances confidence and reduces feelings of difference and isolation.  De-compartmentalise services for BME disabled people.  Deliver Hate Crime support through existing services.  Need to improve police officers understanding about disability Hate Crime.   85   Key findings from the  literature review, community interviews and focus groups Further queries that arise from the findings Service Design Options  find it difficult to obtain appropriate support (Begum 1992). There is also evidence of important differences between impairment subgroups. The variations both between and within impairment groups requires a more sophisticated model of disability awareness than many public authorities currently operate.  Having access to someone who is able to advocate (for both disabled children and adults, especially important for those with learning disabilities. Victims also wanted to be consulted as to whom they would like to have act as an advocate for them, and to be involved in decisions and type of support offered. Some evidence of heightened need for referrals to mental health services to help victims recognise that the targeted violence and hostility they experienced was not their fault. Ethnic minority disabled people under used services available to them due to lack of information, language barriers and insensitive or inappropriate services (Butt & Mirza 1996).  Price Homophobic crime Tyrer 2000 found that lesbians and gay male victims tend to keep quiet about their experience of homophobia because of the possible negative reactions if the victim‟s sexuality can be deduced from the incident.   Is there a difference in the likelihood of accessing services between those who are out and those are not out? How can victims obtain support without fear of revealing their sexuality? Price Race Hate Crime There are marked differences between individuals in relation to how long the worst effects take to wear off: one fourth stated they wore off after a few hours; one quarter after a few days; half stated the effects continued for a long time (Bowling 1999). How does repeat victimisation affect this?  Does recovery take longer after the second and subsequent It may not be possible to encourage everyone to report every incident if the effects are so transitory for some victims?   86   Key findings from the  literature review, community interviews and focus groups Further queries that arise from the findings Service Design Options   incidents compared to the first incident?  Place Homophobic crime Victims can be those who have already come out and/or those who haven‟t yet come out.  See literature references above.   People who have yet to come out may want to access services from different places to those who have come out (i.e. non gay support services?).  Place Transphobic crime Victims suffer emotional abuse in domestic spaces in a way that other minorities do not, due to nature of the transition which predisposed relationships to break down.  Main „trigger points‟ is the point of transition (when the changed identity was revealed) in the workplace and education.  Employers have adequate procedures to support their employees undergoing gender transition. Promotion Race Hate Crime A significant number of incidents take place at home or on property? Chahal and Julienne (1999).   See Product above.  Services can and should be delivered at home?  Promotion Homophobic crime Victims can be those who have already come out and/or those who haven‟t yet come out.   Promotional efforts need to distinguish between these two groups of gay/lesbian people and target messages accordingly taking into account product, price and place.  87   Key findings from the  literature review, community interviews and focus groups Further queries that arise from the findings Service Design Options   Promotion Hate Crime There are marked differences between individuals in relation to how long the worst effects take to wear off: one fourth stated they wore off after a few hours; one quarter after a few days; half stated the effects continued for a long time (Bowling 1999).  A significant number of incidents take place at home or on property? Chahal and Julienne (1999).   Should promotional efforts be separately targeted at those for whom the effects wear off quickly?   If yes what should these be?  Promotional literature can be targeted at homes/properties.  Promotion People with disabilities Bullying is embarrassing and humiliating and undermines the self-confidence of people with a learning disability and the confidence of their carers, family and friends.  It adds to feelings of being different and isolated that the majority of people with learning disability already experience (Mencap 1999a). Ethnic minority disabled people under used services available to them due to lack of information, language barriers and insensitive or inappropriate services (Butt & Mirza 1996).

    "abstract": "This research project was commissioned by the Suffolk Hate Crime Partnership with funding allocated to them from the Ministry of Justice. The aim of the project was to provide independent evidence of: the prevalence of Hate Crime in Suffolk; and the needs of victims and communities affected by Hate Crime across the victimisation themes of race, allegiance to a faith, sexuality, gender identity and disability.\n\nFor this project, Hate Crime1 encompasses both hate incidents and Hate Crimes as defined by the Association of Chief Police Officers relating to race, faith, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability.\n\nThe methodology included: a literature review and documentary analysis; analysis of reported Hate Crime and estimating unreported Hate Crime; survey of communities vulnerable to Hate Crime; interviews and focus groups with individuals from communities vulnerable to Hate Crime; interviews with representatives from local agencies and a workshop with representatives from local agencies. Findings from the survey, interviews, focus group and workshop findings should be treated with caution given the relatively small sample of individuals involved. The quantitative data used in the study was affected by the quality and consistency of recording.\n\nThis summary draws together the key findings from the study and three recommendations for local agencies to implement",
