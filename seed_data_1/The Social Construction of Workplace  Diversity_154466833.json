Shawver \n \nABSTRACT \n \n \nThis is a study of “workplace diversity” from a social constructionist perspective.  \nThe perspective holds that while human meaning is socially created, it is the social order \nwhich gives us resources for making this meaning.  There is much literature about \nworkplace diversity from objectivist standpoints that takes for granted the term \n“diversity.”  What is missing is a comprehensive understanding of diversity: what does \nthis term mean?  What does it conceal?  I attempt to contribute to a better understanding \nof diversity by interrogating its construction in popular culture.   \nI analyze the content of an advertising supplement called “Diversity Works,” \npublished in the New York Times Sunday Magazine, with a literal read to learn how \ndiversity is manifestly constructed on the surface as well as how it is typified through \nformula stories.  Diversity is ideally defined as programs for creating a “culture of \niii \ninclusion,” but practical efforts imply normative attempts to assimilate persons \ndesignated as diverse to the standards imposed by the dominant group.        \nI argue that claims about diversity act to construct collective identity for certain \ntypes of people thereby reinforcing their subordinate positions among the social \nhierarchy.  As constructed, the social goodness of diversity is taken for granted, yet by its \nnarrow typification reproduces race and gender divisions and accompanying inequalities.  \nIn practice, diversity is an alternate term for the other, the type of person who is not a \nmember of the highly valued and socially privileged dominant group of white (Anglo) \nmen.  I suggest that diversity is linked to larger structures of domination evidenced by its \nconstruction as agents of social engineering existing to help certain types of people – \nwomen and minorities. \nMy analysis offers potential contributions to diversity scholarship by attending to \nissues of power and dominance as they are constructed and interpreted in popular culture. \nFurther, I contribute to a dialogue about power and dominance relations between identity \ngroups.  Finally, this study contributes to empirical work on the issues of socialization in \nthe workplace.  As constructed, diversity programs invoke the ideal of respecting \ndifference in persons while coordinating sameness in behavior for the benefit of capitalist \nexpansion. \n1 \n \n \n \nChapter One \n \nIntroduction \n \n“Diversity Works \nDiversity means many things to many people – but one thing is certain.  \nCreating a culture of inclusion that celebrates and leverages diverse \nperspectives – from race, gender, age, language and country of origin to \neducational background, sexual orientation and physical disabilities – is a \ncentral objective of the country’s most forward-thinking organizations \n(New York Times, September 14, 2003; emphasis original). \n“Diversity”, or more specifically, “Workplace Diversity”, is a topic that piques \nmy sociological imagination for a number of reasons.  I was an employee for a large \norganization in which I assumed the role of Diversity Champion for my department.  I \nserved on the Diversity Council of this organization and was being considered for \ncertification as a Diversity Trainer.  The goals of this program were to create a dialogue \namong groups of different people.  The rhetoric was about eliminating stereotypes so \npeople who are different from each other can work more effectively together, in order to \nstem conflicts that arise among workers in the course of task performance on the job.   \n2 \nBecause I was working full- time and going to graduate school part-time, I began \nwith a research interest in evaluating the diversity program itself.  My original plan was \nto do a pre-test/post-test design to assess how participation in the diversity seminar \naffected attitudes and work experiences among my company’s employees.  However, in \nmy day-to-day experience in this company, I encountered what I experienced as \ncontradictions and hypocrisy with respect to the rhetoric or persuasive language (Nelson-\nRowe 1995) of diversity which led me to a prior question: It was my experience that \ndiversity and its programs apply to some – but not all – varieties of human diversity.  So, \nwhat, or more appropriately who is included when we say diversity and who is not?   \nHence, my tack on diversity research changed from assessing its effectiveness \nfrom an objective standpoint to trying to understand the social construct itself.  What is \ndiversity?  In the process of reorganizing my research, I saw an advertising supplement \npublished by the New York Times (NYT) on September 14, 2003 titled “Diversity Works.”  \nWhile I originally thought this would be only one of several forms of data I would use to \nexplore the social construction of diversity, the depth of discourse in the advertisement \nwas so rich that it became my only source of data for this analysis of the rhetoric of \ndiversity.  Here, I want to emphasize that it is not my aim to extrapolate my lived \nexperience to comment on in-house practices of private companies, but feel it necessary \nto establish how my interest in the topic was born. \nI begin with some fundamentals of the theoretical perspective of social \nconstructionism, which is the primary framework for the analysis that follows.  Social \nconstructionism is concerned primarily with how we know what we know.  Grounded in \nphenomenology and ethnomethodology (Loseke 2003), this theoretical perspective \n3 \nencourages us to examine how human meaning is both created and maintained in what is \nan historical, philosophical and inherently political process.  Furthermore, \nconstructionism considers the social resources that provide the context for such meaning.  \nMore generally, its analysis contributes to the larger field within the empirical discipline \nof sociology, the sociology of knowledge (Berger and Luckmann 1966), which is \nconcerned with “the relationship between human thought and the social context within \nwhich it arises” (Berger and Luckmann 1966, p. 4). \nSocial constructionism allows us to examine how meaning is created in everyday \nlife and encourages our interrogation into elements of our social life that are instrumental \nin that creation.  The foundations of knowledge in everyday life (Berger and Luckmann \n1966) are created with and through our interactions.  These interactions are the topics to \nbe explored.  Or, as noted by Berger and Luckmann (1966, p. 19) “Everyday life presents \nitself as a reality interpreted by men and subjectively meaningful to them as a coherent \nworld.  As sociologists we take this reality as the object of our analyses.”  \nCentral to the framework of social constructionism is how we understand our \nworld (Loseke 2003).  It concerns how we categorize our world and how we attach labels \nthat serve to distinguish “types of things or types of people” (Loseke 2003, p. 14).  The \nsignificance of categorization goes beyond knowing what to call something, or how to \nrefer to someone – it instructs us how to act, how to behave toward those things and \npeople.  “Constructionist perspectives encourage us to take words seriously because even \nthe most simple words (particularly the most simple words) are categories for entire \nsystems of meaning (Loseke 2003, p. 16 emphasis in original).  This perspective assumes \nthat we categorize things and people in order to organize and simplify our complex world \n4 \n(Loseke 2003).  We categorize by similarity, by what we deem typical.  We know what \nwe know through typification (Loseke 2003). \nTypifications are defined in interactions be they face-to-face, or textually \nmediated and are culturally situated.  That is, social constructions are comprised of \nclaims or rhetoric which are created and distributed by claims-makers and are evaluated \nby audiences in relation to the extent that such claims resonate with culturally held beliefs \n(Loseke 2003).  We learn about typifications through a variety of claims that are verbal, \nvisual and/or behavioral (Loseke 2003).  We learn about typifications through storytelling \nor in the lexicon of social constructionism – formula stories.  “Social problems formula \nstories are narratives about types of experiences involving distinctive types of characters” \n(Loseke 2003, p. 89).  They are evaluated by audience members through practical \nexperience, cultural themes, and feeling rules (Loseke 2003). \n \nData \nI begin from my personal experience with “diversity,” or what Randall Collins \n(2000) might refer to as “the ground zero” for empirical study to examine the construct as \nit is defined in popular culture.  My main interest is in how the concept diversity is \nconstructed for public consumption.  More specifically, how diversity is defined in an \nadvertising supplement published by the New York Times.   \nI use the term popular culture as defined in The Press and Popular Culture by \nConboy (2002, p. 8) who writes:  \nPopular culture works as a discourse in that it provides a framework of \nexpectations, which allows an idealized version of the ordinary people to emerge.  \n5 \nPopular newspapers are potent factors in this normative process as they build \nupon these discourses of the people and can target them emotionally, \neconomically and politically, claiming to speak on their behalf.  \nConboy discusses the power of the popular press and its hegemony in perpetuating \npopular culture.  “A popular press does not only address the people themselves, but \nplaces that address within the dominant economic structures of society since to a large \nextent the categorization of the ordinary people takes place in terms of their relative \neconomic marginalization” (Conboy 2002, p. 16).   He further asserts that it is the popular \nnewspaper that is among the most “productive sites” in the “creation of popular identities \nwithin the rhetoric of popular cultural forms (Conboy 2002, p. 17). \nThis brings us to a discussion of the source of my data – the New York Times \n(NYT) and its role in the creation of identities.  Scholars have noted the importance of the \nNYT.  In “Discovering the News,” for example, Schudson writes, “The World may have \nset the pace for modern mass-circulation journalism, but after 1896 the New York Times \nestablished the standard” (Schudson 1978, p. 106).  Schudson also refers to the influence \nof NYT with respect to its target audience – the wealthy, the near wealthy and the wish to \nbe wealthy.  “Nor did there seem to be much question about the source of the Times’ \ninfluence: wealthy people read the Times, attracted by its conservatism, decency, and \naccuracy” (Schudson 1978, p. 107).  Further, Schudson argues that the sphere of \ninfluence extends beyond the affluent on the basis of the NYT social reputation.   \nThere is, then, a moral dimension to the reading of different kinds of newspapers; \nthere is pride and shame in reading.  This helps establish the plausibility of the \nhypothesis that the Times’ readership was not won simply by the utility of the \n6 \narticles it printed for businessmen and lawyers or the resonance of its political \noutlook with the politics of affluent readers.  The Times attracted readers among \nthe wealthy and among those aspiring to wealth and status, in part, because it was \nsocially approved.  It was itself a badge of respectability” (Schudson 1978, p. \n117).   \nBy virtue of the fact that NYT continues to be among the top ranked newspapers in the \nU.S. in terms of mass-circulation (editorandpublisher.com, 11/03), it maintains its status \nas the standard for newspapers.   \nMy data are from an advertising supplement in the NYT.  Although editors \ndisclaim its content as not involving the “reporting or editing staff” of the NYT, the NYT \nis itself one of the organizational sponsors of the supplement and thereby contributes both \ndirectly and indirectly to the rhetoric of the diversity construct.  More importantly, \nwhether the discourse can be examined as propaganda, ideology, science or news, the \nsocial constructionist perspective holds that it represents knowledge – meaning (Berger \nand Luckmann 1966).  I justify my data as a cultural artifact from the “world’s most \ninfluential” newspaper – a source of claims that contribute to our popular understanding \nof diversity.  What interests me is not only what is included, but also what is excluded \nwhen the word diversity and its forms are invoked and how power and social hierarchy \nare reproduced in the process.  \n   \n7 \nMethod of Analysis \nThe twenty-five page supplement is crafted in a way that first sets the editorial \ntone via an Introduction, which begins “Diversity means many things to many people.”  \nThe theme of the introduction suggests that diversity encompasses many identities, and \nthe introduction spells out specific categories that include “diverse perspectives,” “race,” \n“gender,” “age,” “language,” “country of origin,” “educational background,” “sexual \norientation,” and “physical disabilities.”  Following the introduction are 11 business cases \nof diversity from specific named corporations.  Each contains a Profile in Diversity or \ntestimonial in which the characteristics of a particular employee can be read as typifying \nor giving character to diversity.  Following these business cases, there is an interview, in \nquestion and answer format, with agents of the Federal Government.  The supplement \nends with a summary of the Proprietary Research commissioned by the New York Times \nCompany and conducted on its behalf by the Beta Research Corporation.  This is \npresented as a summary of findings regarding diversity in the workplace.  \nMy analysis strategy was to perform several readings in order to interpret the \nmythologies transmitted in the rhetoric of diversity.  I refer to Barthes (1982) ideas \nregarding mythologies as systems of meaning, which are neither true nor false.  First, I \ntook an analytical or literal approach in which I focused on the mythical speech of \ndiversity.  According to Barthes (1982, p. 110); “Mythical speech is made of a material \nwhich has already been worked on so as to make it suitable for communication: it is \nbecause all the materials of myth (whether pictorial or written) presuppose a signifying \nconsciousness, that one can reason about them while discounting their substance” \n(emphasis in original).  I counted the number of times diversity appeared in the document \n8 \nand attempted to distinguish its meaning and referents as a way of letting the concept “fill \nthe form” (Barthes 1982).  To accomplish this, I typed the entire text into a word \nprocessing document in order to facilitate word searches as well as the ability to cut and \npaste references to diversity into a spreadsheet.  This enabled me to organize the content \nby themes.  In cutting the diversity references out of context, this approach has the effect \nof “destroying the myth” by “making its intention obvious, or by unmasking it.” Barthes \n(1982, p. 128).   \nI read the supplement a second time for constructions of person types.  Here I \nexamined references to the categories of diversity that are stated in the introduction to the \nsupplement (“diverse perspectives,” “race,” “gender,” “age,” “language,” “country of \norigin,” “educational background,” “sexual orientation,” and “physical disabilities.”)  I \nregard some analytic issues posed by O’Barr (1994) which show how advertising \nconstructs “idealized images of people, depicts their patterns of interacting with others, \nand positions them in the social hierarchy” (O’Barr 1994, p. 3).   The construction of \nperson types or “collective identities” (Loseke 2003) becomes clear in this reading.  What \nare conspicuous by absence are references to categories of “dominant group ethnic \nidentity” (Doane 1997), as well as references to other ethnic groups or “out” groups, \narguably those who have yet to become “serious contenders for power positions in North \nAmerican organizations” (Konrad 2003, p. 4).  \n9 \nIn this document analysis I focus on the “language of claims-making” (Spencer \n2000) and how claims are linked to the larger cultural context.  My data of text excerpts \nappear in italics setting them apart from theoretical references.  I ground my observations \nwithin the field of sociology in general and social constructionism in particular.  I also \ninclude references to scholars of cultural studies, organizational psychology, group and \norganization management and mass media, but contain the bulk of my analytical \nreferences within the realm of the constructionist perspective. \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n \n \nChapter Two \n \nHistorical Context of Diversity as an Objective Condition \n \nIn this paper, I analyze the construct of diversity from a social constructionist \nperspective, which situates the interest in subjective concern.  However, I feel it is \nnecessary to comment on the construct in terms of its historical context.  As such, this \nchapter concerns diversity as an objective condition with objective indicators.  The extent \nto which my subjective analysis leads me to contextualize the concept of workplace \ndiversity and its training programs as stemming from a long history of attempts to \nmanage good workers necessitates a brief discussion of how it is linked to other similar \nmanagerial directives.  Further, by conceptualizing diversity first as an objective \ncondition with historical roots provides a natural launch to its examination with a \nsubjective lens.  As Loseke (2003, p. 8) writes: “While it makes sense to examine social \nproblems as objective conditions involving flesh and blood people, we cannot stop there \nbecause it is not enough.  Social problems are about things and people we worry about, \nand when we talk about ‘worry’ we go beyond objectivity into subjective definitions” \n(emphasis in original). \nKonrad (2003) traces the historical growth of diversity as a “business case,” the \nstudy of which “crystallized as a management subfield in the late 1980s” following the \n11 \npublication of the Hudson Institute’s paper titled “Workforce 2000: Work and Workers in \nthe 21st Century.”  Konrad (2003, p. 5) cites three claims about the importance of \ndiversity from a business perspective: \nFirst…a more diverse U.S. labor force means that businesses desiring to attract \nand retain the highest quality talent will have to recruit from all demographic \ncategories as the traditional White male demographic shrinks in relative size.  \nSecond, a more diverse U.S. society plus a globalized marketplace means a more \ndiverse customer base, and businesses that employ a more diverse workforce will \ngarner market intelligence to help them sell to potential customers from a variety \nof cultural backgrounds.  Third, demographically diverse groups can outperform \nhomogeneous groups on problem-solving and creativity tasks because diverse \ngroups contain a greater variety of information, experience, perspectives, and \ncognitive styles. \nAs earlier stated, objective conditions are defined by objective indicators.  The \nSociety for Human Resource Management, 1997 (cited in Konrad 2003, p. 5) reports, \n“…by 1997, 75% of Fortune 500 organizations had diversity management programs.”  \nThe crux of Konrad’s argument is that while the “business case” appealed to the interests \nof the powerful, it is not only limited in its attempts to promote equality for “historically \nexcluded groups,” but perpetuates “power/dominance relations between identity groups.”   \nWhile diversity programs are relatively new in organizational practice, they can \nbe understood as direct descendants of previous efforts to socially engineer harmonious \ninteraction between different kinds of people.  Kanter (1993, p. 18) summarizes the \ndevelopment of managerial ideologies from the time when large corporations began to \n12 \n“emerge as dominant organizational form in the decades between 1890 and 1910.”  From \ninterorganizational and functional consolidation, which inspired “the tools, techniques, \nand functions of management” to the actual development of early management theory, \nwhich “developed rationality as the central ideal of the organization and the special \nprovince of managers;” Kanter discusses management development and its role in the rise \nof the more modern movement of human relations. \nWhen human relations theory filtered into the management level of corporations \nin the form of sensitivity training groups in the late 1950s and 1960s, it coexisted \nalongside theories and techniques for rational decision-making.  Sensitivity \ngroups were considered a vehicle for learning about relationships so as to master, \nnot unleash, emotional factors counter-productive to the organization (Kanter \n1993, p. 24). \n The historical development of management points to the functional hierarchy that \ncontinues to exist in modern organizations.  Namely – those who manage, and those who \nwill be managed – arguably, dominant and subordinate groups, respectively.  Scholars \nhave argued that those who are among the managerial elite are necessarily a \nhomogeneous group due to business factors that require a certain degree of predictability \namong decision-makers.  Kanter (1993) names “uncertainty, discretion and the need for \ntrust” as variables that reflect homogeneity among managers.    \n13 \nKanter reports (1993, p. 53): \nThe lack of structure in top jobs makes it very important for decision-makers to \nwork together closely in at least the harmony of shared understanding and a \ndegree of mutual trust…the solidarity that can be mustered through common \nmembership in social networks, and the social control this provides, is a helpful \nsupplement for decision-makers.   \nNoble (1982) argues that the uncertainty of individual action and response in \norganizations has complicated efforts to generate consistency and efficiency since the \nemergence of the first corporations.  Noble (1982) identifies four historical currents that \nhave given rise to the “social force of modern management” one of which he identifies as \n“the man problem.”  Noble writes, “The third, which emerged as an aspect of and in \nresistance to the first two, was the intensifying “man problem”- the need to discipline and \nmotivate labor, and neutralize opposition which thwarted efficient production, challenged \nthe inevitability of capitalist industrial development, and threatened corporate stability” \n(Noble 1982, p. 259).  I contend that diversity programs exist to oppose the threat to \ncorporate stability by requiring minorities to conform to the ways of the majority.   \nIndeed, Rose’s (1996, p. 131) ideas suggest that diversity programs are among \n“practices for acting upon the conduct of persons” within the organization – to deal with, \nas Noble puts it, “the man problem.”  Rose offers a framework and methodology for \ninvestigating such practices which he suggests are “seeking to render these problems \nintelligible and, at the same time, manageable” (Rose 1996, p. 131).  Within this, I argue \nthat diversity training can be understood as a manifestation of government arising out of \nproblemetizing the situation of a diverse workforce that requires strategies for the \n14 \nconduct of conduct (Rose 1996).  “Perhaps one could say that the general strategic field \nof all those programmes of government that regard themselves as liberal has been defined \nby the problem of how free individuals can be governed such that they enact their \nfreedom appropriately” (Rose 1996, p. 134).  With this I suggest that by constructing \ndiversity as an intelligible “thing” is to make it manageable.  Diversity programs are not \nconstructed in business for fun and recreation or to necessarily to build harmony among \ndiverse individuals.  They are cons trued to further the aims of capitalists and hence are \nconstructed in ways that maintain the existing social hierarchy of those who manage and \nthose who will be managed.  It is this construction to which we now turn. \nThe historical context of diversity and its programs is a useful launch to examine \ndiversity as it is currently constructed in an advertising supplement in the NYT.   Because \nit is this history that provides the patterns of discourse that are carried in social \nconstructions – “historical descriptions are necessarily ordered by the present state of \nknowledge, they increase with every transformation and never cease, in turn, to break \nwith themselves…” (Foucault 1972, p. 5).  The current rhetoric not only draws upon, but \nalso further exploits the ideas that have become resources for our interpretation of efforts \nto control workers at the behest of managers.  Essentially, these programs can be \nconceptualized as serving initiatives for the control of individual uncertainty and, as \nconstructed, invoke the ideal of respecting difference in persons while coordinating \nsameness in behavior for the benefit of capitalist expansion. \n \n \n15 \n \n \n \nChapter Three \n \nConstructing the Meaning of Diversity as a Subjective Condition \n \nConstructionists have noted the importance of language and storytelling in \nproviding explanation and understanding of our social world.  Language “objectifies” and \n“expands;” it “typifies” and “anonymizes” (Berger and Luckmann 1966).  “Because of its \ncapacity to transcend the ‘here and now,’ language bridges different zones within the \nreality of everyday life and integrates them into a meaningful whole” (Berger and \nLuckmann 1966, p. 39).  Language is constructive.  It uses vocabulary, grammar, \nclassification schemes, and numbers as materials to build meaning.  I begin with a \nquestion: What does diversity mean in everyday life?  Then, proceed more specifically: \nHow is diversity constructed in the NYT supplement – which can be read as a story or \nnarrative about diversity?    \nThe narrative of diversity is a formula story complete with a plot, characters and \nan underlying moral point.  The narrative of the diversity story is told through a \ncombination of personal testimonials, statistics and research results by several \norganizational sponsors or claims-makers.  The story begins with a positive statement: \n“Diversity Works” and then proceeds with 25 pages that construct what, why and how \ndiversity works.  In this chapter, I discuss what diversity is, why diversity is important \n16 \nand how diversity is accomplished as it is socially constructed in one document.  I refer \nto the social construction of diversity via the lexicon of the social construction of social \nproblems, but that is not to suggest that diversity is constructed as problematic.  Indeed, \nits construc tion can be interpreted as a solution to problems.  However, I contend that by \nits construction as a condition with solutions, diversity is “problemetized” (Rose 1996). \nSeveral claims-making strategies have been identified as effective in establishing \nparameters or the grounds of a condition with the aim of persuading audience members to \nbelieve and support the claims being made.  “Claims-makers construct the grounds of a \nsocial problem condition when they define it, and when they specify the harm and the \nnumber of victims it creates” (Loseke 2003, p. 55 emphasis in original).  The introduction \nto the supplement circumvents defining the specific condition (a common claims-making \nstrategy), and rather provides a vague, yet all encompassing idea of the condition – \ndiversity.  That is, the grounds of diversity are not explicitly constructed.   \n“Diversity means many things to many people” (p. 75). \nWhile grounds suggest scope and effect with regard to the facts of a condition, the \nfacts themselves are meaningless until they are “framed.”  Hence, I want to discuss the \nframes of diversity in more detail before providing an interpretation of the grounds.  But, \nI feel it is necessary to introduce the concept of grounds as it provides meaningful context \nfor frames.  I will return to a more explicit talk of the grounds of diversity in the next \nchapter.  The point I want to stress is that social problems frames give meaning to the \nparameters that are established (Loseke 2003) and social constructionists have identified \ncommon claims-making strategies which construct this meaning. \n \n17 \nDiagnostic Frames: What kind of problem is diversity? \nThe diagnostic frame tells the reader what kind of condition exists (Loseke 2003).  \n“Diagnostic frames answer audience members’ questions about how to understand the \nmeaning of the condition and what causes it” (Loseke 2003, p. 61).  Loseke (2003) \nidentifies two broad types of diagnostic frames that are common in defining the scope of \na condition: social frames and individual frames.  The meaning of diversity in the NYT is \ndiagnosed in terms of social forces (Loseke 2003) or more specifically, “mass \nimmigration” of the “foreign-born population.” \nIn the 1990’s alone, the foreign-born population nearly doubled, to 31 million \npeople.  That group now comprises 11 percent of the total reported population - a \nmass immigration comparable to that of the early 20th century (p. 76). \nAdditionally, the condition of diversity is constructed as resulting from the well-\nknown and commonly accepted characteristic of the United States, or, the so called \n“melting pot.”  The effectiveness of this claim lies in its familiarity with readers.  The \nmajor point is that diversity is constructed as part of a larger concern.  Spencer (2000) \nnotes how claims-makers construct conditions by appropriating “familiar elements of a \nbroader discursive context” (Spencer 2000, p. 36).   \n“…The United States is more of a melting pot today than at any time in its \nhistory” (p. 76). \nAnother effective claims-making strategy to encourage audiences to take claims \nseriously is the use of statistics.  Spencer (2000, p. 31) writes, “…official statistics \nconstitute cultural discourse, constructed by all sorts of claims-makers, that is \nappropriated in constructing new problems.”  The use of numbers not only provides \n18 \naudience members with the scope of a condition, but also provides objectivity (Spencer \n2000).  The NYT diversity supplement contains many such statistics dramatizing the size \nand economic impact of a diverse population. \nHispanics, African-Americans and Asian Americans now constitute almost 30 \npercent of the country’s population, or 85 million people (p. 76).  \nAcross the country, they [Hispanics, African-Americans and Asian Americans] \ncommand over $1.5 trillion in annual purchasing power (p. 76).  \nBy the year 2050, these same groups will tip the scale from minority to majority \n(p. 76). \n \nMotivational Frames:  Why should anyone care about diversity? \nWhere diagnostic frames answer readers’ questions about what diversity is and \nhow we are to understand it, motivational frames construct the reasons why audience \nmembers should care.   The motivational claims about diversity are justified by the \ndiagnostic frame and are constructed in ways that key into cultural themes or “widely \nheld ideas about the ways the world should work” (Loseke 2003, p. 69).  \nOverwhelmingly, the motivation for diversity is constructed as important to support the \ncultural theme of capitalism, which is defined by beliefs about the “goodness of private \nproperty, private profit, and a free market for goods and labor” (Loseke 2003, p. 65).   \nAudience members should care because diversity is constructed as a business imperative \nor corporate objective:    \nIf corporate marketers understand the cultural buttons to push, the argument \ngoes, their organizations will prosper (p. 76). \n19 \n“By bringing about greater diversity in our workplace…attain our ambitious \ngoals in the media marketplace of the 21st century” (The New York Times \nCompany, p. 92). \n“Aetna’s managers are graded by their ability to reach diversity-related goals” \n(Aetna, p. 84). \n“Understanding the benefits of diversity is one of our strategic goals for 2003” \n(LaSalle Bank, p. 91). \nThis focus on appealing to the cultural theme of capitalism is sensible given that \nthe audience is NYT readers – the wealthy, near wealthy and desire to be wealthy \n(Schudson 1978).  This particular audience is comprised of people most likely to applaud \nbusiness success.  Arguably, these readers are among managers and business owners, or \naspire to be.  Constructing diversity claims in ways resonating with the target audience \nmakes it more likely that claims will be evaluated successfully.  Audience members \nshould care because diversity is constructed as a successful marketing strategy: \n…the need for companies to reflect the demographic changes within the United \nStates…marketing…to expand their appeal…the available talent pool for the \nwork force… (p. 76). \n“There are emerging markets that are presenting themselves every year… to \nexpand their appeal to geographic regions, to people of different races, genders \nand to other untapped markets…” (p. 76). \n“We need to have a work force that is representative of the markets we are trying \nto serve” (Deutsche Bank, p. 80). \n20 \nCapturing a bigger share of various ethnic markets is a stated goal of Coors’s \nmarketing department (Coors Brewing Company, p. 82). \n…to serve their increasingly diverse Midwestern markets (LaSalle Bank, p. 91). \n \nThe Prognostic Frame: How is diversity accomplished? \nThe motivational rhetoric that constructs why readers should care about diversity \noffers support for the prognostic frame, which constructs the solution or prescription to a \ncondition or problem (Loseke 2003).  In the diversity supplement the prognostic frame \nconstructs how diversity is accomplished.  This is what constitutes the main line of \nrhetoric throughout the remainder of the supplement – arguably, diversity training is what \nis being sold in this particular supplement.  The supplement is replete with testimony \nabout the benefits of diversity with many examples of training strategies in the service of \nbusiness growth and market expansion.  The meaning of diversity rhetoric becomes clear: \nDiversity becomes constructed as good business practice to help meet corporate \nmarketing objectives achieved through training.   \nCorporate diversity programs were once initiated by human resources \ndepartments eager to resolve disputes of disgruntled employees.  Today, these \nprograms have evolved into high-profile initiatives, the success of which are tied \ndirectly to a company’s bottom line as well as to employee compensation and \nperformance reviews (p. 76). \nThey are in the process of rolling out diversity-awareness programs, which \ninclude an online training session and a standard seminar for managers, to help \n21 \nthem work with a diverse work force and customer base (Cingular Wireless, p. \n78). \n…a training program in diversity awareness…to increase cultural sensitivity so \nthat these managers can work together more effectively (Deutsche Bank, p. 80). \n“…training session about managing culture and integration…It is really all about \nincreasing peoples’ awareness about the advantages of diversity” (Pfizer, p. 80). \n“I have seen firsthand how diversity training can help to solve real problems and \nmisunderstandings” (testimonial – Coors Bottling Company, p. 82). \nThe stated goals of diversity including “demographic reflection” and “emerging \nmarket” penetration point to the next focus in my analysis, the construction of people or \nidentities.  It is through the construction of identities that the grounds for diversity are \nmade clear.  As stated earlier, claims-makers construct the grounds when they specify the \nharm of the condition, who is affected and to what extent.  What becomes clear is that \ndiversity refers to certain groups of people who are constructed as needing help.  \nDiversity comes to mean training programs for particular people in the service of \ncapitalism.  Who are these people?  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \n \n \nChapter Four \n \nConstructing Identity \n \n  In the last chapter I discussed how claims-makers frame conditions – that is, how \nthey use popular wisdom and cultural themes as resources giving meaning to diversity.  \nHere I will focus on the grounds or parameters themselves.  Claims-makers construct the \ngrounds of a condition when they offer definition, when they provide typifications in \norder to specify who is affected and to what extent.  In the diversity supplement I \nconsider both the formal definition as well as the typifying stories that provide implicit \ndefinitions of diversity.  I argue that diversity is implicitly defined in terms of race and \ngender, yet as constructed in the NYT supplement, appears to have a greatly “expanded \ndomain” (Loseke 2003).  This expanded definition of diversity appears first in the \nintroduction to the supplement: \n“Diversity means many things to many people – but one thing is certain.  \nCreating a culture of inclusion that celebrates and leverages diverse perspectives \n– from race, gender, age, language, country of origin to educational background, \nsexual orientation and physical disabilities – is a central objective of the \ncountry’s most forward-thinking organizations.” (p. 75, emphasis in the original). \n23 \nRationale expansion (Kunkel 1995), which can occur when “…a putative \ncondition [is] constructed by appropriating existing problems as its consequences” \n(Spencer 2000, p. 31), is constructed repeatedly throughout the rest of the document with \nrespect to ‘diversity’.  That is, the construct appropriates traditional categories of \ndiversity such as race and gender and expands the diversity to include many other aspect \nof individual difference.  Diversity is formally defined as going beyond race and gender: \n“We think of it in a way that is not limited to the traditional EEO (Equal \nEmployment Opportunity] categories of race, gender and ethnicity” (Pfizer, p. \n80). \n “It is not just race, but culture, gender, religion, age and educational \nbackgrounds” (testimonial – LaSalle Bank, p. 91). \n “… not only the traditional aspects of diversity that we’ve mentioned – race, \ndiversity and background – but also language skill sets, experiences, overseas \ntravel, military experience” (Diversity in the Federal Government, p. 96). \nBut then in examining the specific typifying stories, the content of diversity \ncontracts.  Here, I want to emphasize the tension between the formal definition and the \ntypifying examples.  As constructed, the typifying examples, or the stories that describe \nthe most common experience (Loseke 2003), do not reflect the formally expanded \ncontent.  Constructionists have identified this as a successful strategy in that it settles \ndisagreements by avoiding explicit specifications.  “Audience members tend to take such \ntypifying stories as specifying the condition at hand” (Loseke 2003, p. 56).   \nWhile the rhetoric about diversity seems to be greatly expanded, the typifications \nof diversity tell a different story.  These typifications are revealed in the practical efforts \n24 \nemployed by the sponsors of the supplement, which include councils, forums, network \ngroups and partnerships, as well as the Profiles in Diversity or testimonials offered by \neach organization.  That is, the rhetoric suggesting that diversity is “not just race, but \nculture,” “not only diversity of race, but diversity of language,” is perhaps the formal \nconstruction, yet is not the most common typifying story.  Many typifying stories are \nmost obviously about gender: \n“Members of the women’s forum…can turn to other women for support and \nmentoring…get the direct coaching and guidance that they need…help one \nanother learn how to make successful trade-offs in their work-life issues, to find \nways to juggle their work and home life” (p. 78). \n“We have set out to look at how the system was structured, and see how we could \nchange it to attract women and other talent groups that we need in order to \nflourish as a company…” (Booz Allen Hamilton p. 90). \nThe company’s formal executive succession program is an…example of this \nphilosophy in action…Janet L. Robinson… promoted to the newly created \nposition of senior vice president, newspaper operations…Cynthia H. Augustine… \ntook on added responsibilities as president of the Broadcast Group (The NYT \nCompany, p.92). \nMany other stories are about race and ethnicity: \n“N.S.B.E. is important to us because it is the largest source of African-American \nengineers in the world…” (p. 78) \nEdna Hecht is on the planning committee for the AstraZeneca African American \nNetwork, which launched in July… (AstraZeneca, p. 88). \n25 \n…comprehensive and ongoing recruiting effort… national minority organizations \nsuch as the National Black M.B.A. Association, the National Association of Black \nJournalists, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and the Asian \nAmerican Journalists Association (The NYT Company, p. 92). \n…along with Solomon B. Watson, our company’s general counsel, who is African-\nAmerican, belong to the eight-member Executive Committee of The New York \nTimes Company (The NYT Company, p. 92). \nIn February, there was a celebration of Black History Month, with a series of \nlectures on African-American culture (DaimlerChrysler, p. 94). \nWasow, executive director of BlackPlanet.com – the largest online destination for \nAfrican-Americans and a subsidiary of Community Connect, Inc. – moderated the \ndiscussion (Diversity in the Federal Government, p. 95). \nIn comparison to the many examples of diversity linked to race, ethnicity and/or \ngender, there were very few stories typifying other possible forms of diversity. \nSilent Coors, a networking group for deaf and hearing-impaired employees… \n(Coors Brewing Company, p. 82). \n“At the round table, we talk mostly about career progression… what it is like to \nbe a…gay staffer.”  (testimonial – Booz Allen Hamilton, p. 90). \n“For Louise Young, founder of Raytheon’s Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and \nTransgendered Employee Groups, the Raytheon diversity initiative is more than \njust tolerating diverse employees” (testimonial – Raytheon, p. 93). \n…series of focus groups this year, reaching out to different diverse groups, to see \nwhat kinds of things would encourage them to work with the C.I.A., what \n26 \npreconceived notions they have, and what advertising concepts work well.  One of \nthose groups is the disabled (Diversity in the Federal Government, p. 95). \nTypifying stories of diversity define not only who is a part of diversity, but also \nwho is not.  For example, there is nothing in the supplement which constructs diversity as \nperspectives, educational background, religious beliefs, age and/or styles of interaction \ndiversity.  The stories that typify diversity point to salient characteristics for certain \nindividuals.  Moreover, the stories emphasize the differences among individuals that have \nbeen historically problemetized – namely race, ethnicity and gender.   That is, sexuality, \nphysical disability and other forms of difference are less often deemed problems for \nbusinesses to overcome.     \nClaims that construct images of diversity can be seen as motivating readers to \noffer support or sympathy to those individuals defined as diverse.  I argue that these \nclaims key into humanitarian themes which “focus on victims and their suffering” \n(Loseke 2003, p. 77) as well as the “heroes” that offer liberation.  “…humanitarian \nthemes appeal to the noble side of people – our capacity to care about others” (Loseke \n2003, p. 77). \n \nThe Story of Diversity: Victims and Heroes \n Women, minorities and to a lesser extent, disabled… are the particular types of \npeople constructed by the NYT as “diverse.”  Further, and critically, the act of \nconstructing individuals in terms of their apparent salience creates identities of those who \n“need” assistance, which stigmatizes particular individuals – “victims” of diversity, so to \nspeak.  In discussing the construction of “multicultural students” as victims of a school \n27 \nsystem not taking these students’ needs into account, Nelson –Rowe (1997, p. 95) writes:  \n“The victim identity assigned to these students makes them ultimately dependent upon \nthe multicultural educator-heroes for their liberation.  Moreover, for students to gain their \nown power they must accept the multiculturalists’ cons truction of their problems.”  The \nclaims made in the diversity supplement suggests, too, that certain employees are helped \nor “liberated” by company leaders or “heroes” and their success is defined in terms of \ntheir “diversity.” \nThe most successful companies… have devoted significant resources to making \nthemselves more diverse… understand how to market themselves in the rapidly \nexpanding multicultural marketplace… those are organizations whose top \nleadership leads the diversity initiative (p. 78). \n“…Minority-individuals face barriers to success in a variety of ways.  Mentoring \nprograms help them overcome their limitations and understand how to operate \neffectively in the company…” (testimonial – Pfizer, p. 80) \n…is the secretary of the Coors Hispanic Employee Network (CHEN), though he is \nnot Hispanic.  As a floor supervisor, he approached CHEN for help…when he \nwanted to understand a conflict between two employees…‘… they ended up \ngiving…a…presentation about the roots of misunderstandings between some \nHispanics and non-Hispanics (testimonial – Coors Brewing Company, p. 82).  \nBorn in China…came to the United States…The transition from academia to the \ncorporate world was a difficult one.  Wang sought out a senior \nexecutive…enlisted his support as mentor, and learned from his experience and \n28 \nperspective about the company.  ‘I talked to my mentor…I followed his \nadvice’…(testimonial – DuPont, p. 86). \nThis effort has the personal backing of…company chairman and Times publisher, \n…Each has been a mentor to women and minorities throughout the company, and \nthey take pride in and responsibility for their success (The NYT Company, p. 92). \nThis rhetoric can be read as defining the dominant group – the heroes – as well as \nthe subordinate group – the victims.  Identities constructed in the supplement construct \npersons in terms of salient characteristics and “cultural markers” (Doane 1997).  \nHowever, dominant group members are not distinguished and are, as Doane (1997, p. \n377) writes,  “…less likely to be reminded of social and cultural differences on a day-to-\nday basis…”  Few references are made to white males in the supplement, the references \nthat do appear reflect the reciprocal nature of ethnicity or “us and them” (Doane 1997) \nand accompanying power/dominance relations.   \nFurther, the act of definition itself is the province of the powerful.  This act of \ndefinition can be seen as imposing master statuses (Goffman 1963) on particular people, \nwhich have the effect of overriding all other features of their personal identity.  That is, \nthe typifying stories of diversity encourage readers to think about diversity in particular \nways as exemplified by particular people. \nArguably, the dominant group is neglected because they are among the powerful.  \nThere is no need to study a group unless there is a perceived need to change it.  The \ndominant group does not need to be constructed.  It is the taken for granted baseline, the \ncharacteristics that “just are.”  What the rhetoric of the diversity supplement repeatedly \nsuggests is that minority individuals or subordinate groups need to learn the ropes, to \n29 \nassimilate, to “melt” as it were.  The rhetoric suggests that the behaviors among women \nand minorities need to conform to the expectations of the majority/dominate group. \nThe social relationships depicted throughout this advertisement are such that \nwomen and minorities are targets for programs.  As O’Barr (1994, p. 4) argues, \n“Advertising first defines the category, but it quickly moves to place it in a social \ncontext.”  What follows in the construction of identities in a social relationship is the \nquality of those relationships.  “They are seldom egalitarian…most messages are about \ndominance and subordination, about power and submission to it” (O’Barr 1994, p. 4). \nFor the most part, the diversity departments coordinate recruiting efforts and \nensure that women and members of minority groups own an increasing share of a \ncompany’s primary and secondary suppliers (p. 76). \nCoors’s supplier-diversity program sets annual spending goals and objectives \nrelated to doing business with minority- and women-owned businesses (Coors \nBrewing Company p. 82). \n…established three affinity groups for African-Americans, Middle Easter and \nArab-Americans and women (DaimlerChrysler, p. 94). \n…programs to recruit women and members of minority groups (F.B.I. Recruits \nDiversity, p. 99) \n“The minority candidates we talked to in our survey, both women and men, told \nus that they are paying attention to whether a company has programs in place \nthat will cater to their needs (proprietary research NYT, p. 100). \n \n \n30 \n \n \n \nChapter Five \n \nPerpetuating Power/Dominance Relations \n \nI contend that “Diversity Works” is a powerful package of claims.  The rhetoric of \ndiversity suggests that its “goodness” is over-determined.  It includes everyone, it is good \nfor everyone, and most importantly it works for business.  Throughout this paper I \ndemonstrated how the formal rhetoric of inclusion is complicated and contradicted by the \nimplicit typifications that provide images and character to diversity.  What I attempted to \ndo in my analysis was to unpack the story of diversity and show how it reflects the \ninterests of the dominant over the subordinate.   \nThe major points I make are that diversity the condition is socially constructed as \ngood for business, it helps people (certain people) and is successfully practiced through \ntraining programs.  Further, I argue that as socially constructed, the condition “diversity” \nand its solutions are taken for granted in organizational practice as are the attendant \ncollective identities constructed therewith.  I assert that the implications of diversity as \nconstructed in the supplement perpetuate power and dominance relations through the \nconstruction of identities in terms of those who need help (victims) and those who \nprovide it (heroes).   \n31 \nAs stated earlier, the importance of how meaning is constructed goes beyond \nmere categorization (knowing what to call something, or how to refer to someone) – it \ninstructs us how to act toward conditions and people.  I argue that diversity as constructed \nin “Diversity Works” is a veil.  A simple word that comprises and disguises an entire \nsystem of meaning – namely issues of racism, sexism, heterosexism, ablism, classism, \netc. (Konrad 2003).  The potency of the diversity construct is in this very simplicity as it \nperpetuates division through a story of inclusion.  Indeed, as Konrad (2003) notes, the \ntheoretical dilution of the diversity construct makes invisible issues of power and \ndominance.  Konrad (2003 p. 4) argues: \n…it is important to draw distinctions between diversity scholarship and the \nindividual differences tradition in organizational studies in order to retain a \ncentral focus on power relations among identity groups and avoid diluting the \ndiversity construct to the point that any group composed of non- identical \nindividuals becomes diverse by definition. \nI suggest that her argument applies beyond the realm of academia and into \norganizational practice where through diversity training, power and dominance relations \nare reproduced.  I argue that diversity does not include “dominant group ethnic identity” \nwhich Doane (1997, p. 376) defines as: “…the ethnic group in a society that exercises \npower to create and maintain a pattern of economic, political, and institutional advantage, \nwhich in turn results in the unequal (disproportionately beneficial to the dominant group) \ndistribution of resources.”  Further, I suggest the power among members of the dominant \ngroup to construct identities reinforces their position atop the social hierarchy.   “With \nrespect to intergroup relations, a key element of dominance is the disproportionate ability \n32 \nto shape the sociocultural understandings of society, especially those involving group \nidentity and intergroup interactions” (Doane 1997, p. 376).  Dominant group members \nhave the power to define “other” identity as well as the privilege of taking for granted \ntheir own.  It is in this definition, however, that power imbalances are reproduced through \ndestructive stereotypes and other institutional limitations. \n   Konrad (2003, p. 6) writes: \n…arguments suggesting that managers need to become more flexible to deal with \nthe cultural differences of a diverse workforce often ignore the destructive impact \nof stereotyping, prejudice, and institutional and interpersonal discrimination \nbecause raising these sensitive issues can be threatening to power holders.  \nArguments that a diverse set of employees will bring market intelligence about \ntheir cultural groups threaten to ghettoize members of historically excluded \ngroups, limiting them to positions where they represent the company to their own \ncommunities…arguments that businesses should hire members of historically \nexcluded groups because diversifying the workforce will lead to improved \nproblem solving and creativity imply that a diverse workforce is only welcome if \nit outperforms the traditional homogeneous group. \nKanter (1993) identifies diversity as one among six important shifts affecting \ncorporate jobs and careers.  “The workplace increasingly contains teams of people from \nmany different social and cultural categories.  Instead of affirmative action to recruit \nindividuals, the managerial priority has shifted to building teams, to managing and even \naffirming diversity” (Kanter 1993, p. 290).  Kanter also discusses several dilemmas of \ndiversity primarily as a result of “changing numbers.”  “An oft-quoted statistic indicates \n33 \nthat by the year 2000 up to 80 percent of all new entrants to the work force will be \nminorities and/or women” (Kanter 1993, p. 315).   \nDiversity Supplement agrees:  \n“By 2050, 85 percent of the entrants into the work force will be people of color \nand women” (p. 76).   \nKanter suggests, however, that the statistic is misleading.  “What the raw statistic \ndoes not reveal, however, is the likelihood that nonminority white males who are already \nin place will still dominate the upper ends of professional and managerial \npyramids…”(1993, p. 315).  She identifies several dynamics that interfere with the \nacceptance of diversity, which include “the human tendency for managers to pick those \nwith whom they feel most comfortable to serve as confidantes or trusted \naides…especially important in higher risk jobs” (1993, p. 316).  \nThe groups who are most often referred to when the term diversity is invoked are \nwomen and minorities, or arguably those groups who have been, as Konrad might \nsuggest, “historically excluded.”  The rhetoric of diversity which promotes programs for \ncreating a culture of inclusion suggests that the goal is assimilation of behavior among \nthese persons designated as diverse to be consistent with dominant group norms and \nexpectations.  Obtusely, there is no group for Anglo-Americans.  There is no mention of a \nMen’s forum.  There is no need to assimilate members of the dominant group. \nAs Konrad (2003, p. 10) argues “Diversity issues only became salient to scholars \nin the fields of management, human resources, and organizational studies when groups \nwho had been historically excluded from power positions began to enter organizations in \nlarge enough numbers to affect organizational processes.”  Interestingly, that an \n34 \nadvertising supplement endorsing the benefits of diversity exists at all suggests the \nunderlying dynamics of power and dominance.  As Kanter suggests, business success \ndepends in large part on efficiency and predictability, more specifically, control over \nuncertainty. \nI am reminded of Weber’s (1946, p. 192) ideas regarding power and stratification.  \n“…the market and its processes ‘knows no personal distinctions’: ‘functional’ interests \ndominate it.  It knows nothing of ‘honor’.”  The fact that we have a resource that tells the \nstory of “diversity,” that “Diversity Works” itself suggests that something is at stake – \nnamely economic growth and market penetration.  We might ask why we need to be \npersuaded that diversity is a good thing at all.  Weber’s theories might suggest that the \nanswer lies in the perceived threats among the powerful whose status depends on the \nacquisition and distribution of goods and services – or more appropriately, economic \nstability and predictability.  “Every technological repercussion and economic \ntransformation threatens stratification by status and pushes the class situation into the \nforeground…every slowing down of the shifting of economic stratifications leads, in due \ncourse, to the growth of status structures and makes for a resuscitation of the important \nrole of social honor” (Weber 1946, p. 194). \nCapitalism requires economic predictability for its furtherance, which is in \nkeeping with Weber’s ideas regarding formal rationality.  Diversity programs can be \ninterpreted as a manifestation of the “rationalization of social life.”  Weber, cited in \nKanter’s work (1993, p. 22) writes: “Its specific nature…is developed the more perfectly \nbureaucracy is ‘de-humanized,’ the more completely it succeeds in elimination from \nofficial business love, hatred, and all purely personal, irrational, and emotional elements \n35 \nwhich escape calculation.  This is the specific nature of bureaucracy, and it is appraised \nas its special virtue.” \nWeber’s ideas can be used to understand the tensions that are apparent in the \nformal and implicit rhetoric about diversity that are made apparent in this constructionist \nanalysis.  As stated in chapter three, the meaning of diversity is constructed as good for \nbusiness and marketing and that it respects all forms of difference.  But in chapter four I \nexamine typifications, or implicit definitions that contradict these formally stated ideals.  \nI suggest the tensions are due to the incompatibility between the interests of managers to \nexpand business and the ideals of harmony between and among workers.   \nThe status of the dominant group depends on capitalist expansion.  Capitalist \nexpansion depends on efficiencies and rationality, which are arguably threatened by the \nunpredictability among workers who are diverse.  Diversity programs can be understood \nas “technologies” for the “conduct of conduct” (Rose 1996) that exist to maintain the \nstandards as well as the functional hierarchy established by the dominant group – those \nwho manage and those who will be managed. \nWhat becomes clear in reading the diversity myth in its “inextricable whole” \n(Barthes 1982) is that diversity programs are indeed for particular types of people.  That \nis, they are purported to exist to build awareness and/or tolerance, career development, \nsupport, mentoring, guidance for minorities in general (read: non-white, non-male, non-\nheterosexual, and less frequently, physically disabled).  In theory, diversity is constructed \nto be very inclusive.  In practice, diversity is very narrowly applied. \nClaims made by diversity advocates throughout the NYT supplement, like those \nmade by multicultural educators (Nelson-Rowe 1995) perpetuate collective identity \n36 \nconstruction thereby reinforcing the subordinate positions of particular individuals.    \nThroughout the supplement is evidence of both implicit and explicit subjugation.   \nDiscourse that reinforces stereotypes, ghettoizes members of historically excluded \ngroups, relegates a diverse workforce as a good thing only if it “outperforms the \ntraditional homogeneous group” (Konrad 2003) perpetuates power/dominance \ninequalities and reinforces the social order of those who manage and those who will be \nmanaged.  “The language, norms and values of engineered cultures become internalized \nand dominate employees’ subjectivity” (Ezzy 2001, p. 631).  I argue that as constructed \nin this one advertisement, diversity claims and the cultural discourse that is appropriated \ncontribute to this rhetoric and as such conceals and reproduces power inequities in \norganizational practice.   \n \n \n37 \n \n \n \nChapter Six \n \nReflections and Further Research Considerations \n \n In this paper, I conduct a social constructionist examination of diversity in an \nadvertising supplement published in the New York Times Sunday magazine.  I interpret \nthe language of diversity claims against a theoretical backdrop informed by the sociology \nof knowledge in general, social constructionism in particular.  I argue that it is through \nlanguage that we come to know and understand our social world – perhaps most \nimportantly, how we learn to act/react within our social world.  Here I leverage \ntheoretical developments that speak to issues of social stratification, power and \ndominance.  As constructed formally, diversity invokes ideals of harmony and \ntogetherness, but as implicitly defined, it perpetuates collective identity construction that \nreinforces strongly held beliefs about who is victimized and who is heroic.  Finally, I \nattempt to link my interpretive findings to more macro-structural concerns regarding \nsocial control in the workplace and the social order, which provides its resources. \n My paper begins with a brief discussion of diversity as an objective condition that \nhas roots in the development of modern management.  It is beyond the scope of this \npaper, and not the intent of my arguments, to explicate a more thorough historical \ninvestigation.  However, further research that attempts to delineate, as Rose might \n38 \nsuggest “the genealogy of subjectification” with respect to the diversity construct would \ncontribute greater understanding of diversity as a “device of ‘meaning production’.”  \n“These intellectual techniques do not come ready made, they have to be invented, refined \nand stabilized, they have to be disseminated and implanted in different ways in different \npractices – schools, families, streets, workplaces, courtrooms” (Rose 1996, p. 130). \n As such, I believe that more research is needed that addresses the specifics of \ndiversity programs in organizational practice.  Ethnographic studies, participant \nobservation and the like of the approaches of diversity programs are warranted as well as \nadditional content analysis of greater breadth.  That is, further research on the diversity \nconstruct as defined and depicted in journalistic accounts, advertisements, and \norganizational brochures as well as in the realm of public policy would lend considerably \nmore to the ideas expressed in this study. \n \n \nMethodological Reflections \n There are of course limitations of my sample as well as methods of analysis.  The \nmajor limitation with respect to my data is that they are from one particular document \norganized for and primarily read by a particular audience.  Issues of reliability are \ncomplicated by the fact that I am one reader who offers one interpretation.   \nMy method of analysis, which is largely interpretive, also has its shortcomings.  \nFirst, content analysis is said to be at its ‘best’ when performing both qualitative and \nquantitative analytic strategies (Weber 1985).  While I considered the application of both \nanalytic modes, I chose to employ an inductive approach to my work.  As such, other \n39 \ninterpretations would likely differ.  However, I feel that this limitation offers \nopportunities for further constructionist analysis of other claims about diversity that \nappear in major U.S. newspapers as well as other mass media outlets.   \nFinally, I feel it is important to own the limitations with respect to my macro-\nsociological interpretations.  Specifically, I attempt to link the construct of diversity as it \nappears in one sensational document to issues of social engineering and social control.  I \nconcur that it is a lofty goal, but point to the several advantages of content analysis which \nhave been identified by Weber (1985, p. 10) as concerning: communications which is a \n“central aspect of social interaction”; that ‘exist over long periods of time’; and provide \n‘culture indicators’ that may span ‘even centuries’; and can be used to assess \nrelationships among economic, social, political and cultural change.”   \nI encourage more constructionist examination of journalistic accounts, opinions \nand editorials as well as public policy discourse on the topic of diversity.  In addition, \nthere is much to be learned from the vantage point of “living diversity” that is \nethnographic research within organizations that delves into diversity as it is practiced in \neveryday life.  I believe our understanding will be further informed by more objective \npursuits in organizational research as well.  I do not hold that qualitative and quantitative \nmethods are “antithetical,” I feel they are mutually supportive and informative.  My \ngreatest wish with regard to my work and its limitations is to inspire a dialogue about \ndiversity that does not assume its definition as taken for granted.   \n \n40 \nPractical Implications \nMy analysis offers potential contributions to diversity scholarship by attending to \nissues of power and dominance as they are constructed and interpreted in popular culture.  \nThe sociological relevance for this study is three-fold.  First, I refer to Schudson’s (1984) \nwork regarding advertising as “part of the establishment and reflection of a common \nsymbolic culture.”  I contend that an interpretation of an advertisement for diversity \nprograms is important in that it reveals a perpetuation of constructions on the basis of \nrace and gender that are, as Barthes might consider, “naturalized” by the existence and \ndistribution of the document itself.  Indeed, the characters constructed in the supplement \nare not “whole” or “unique” people.  Readers are told only what is important about them \nas they represent a type of person who is narrowly constructed (Loseke 2002).  They play \nthe part of social type or demographic category (Schudson 1984) thereby reifying these \nsocial distinctions as master statuses (Goffman 1963).   \nSecondly, by dramatizing the ways in which particular people are singled out as \nneeding particular programs, I wish to contribute to a dialogue about power and \ndominance relations between identity groups.  Further, I assert that a social \nconstructionist interpretation on the concept of diversity can aid objective pursuits of the \nstudy of intergroup relations and ethnic stratification.  As Doane (1997, p. 375) writes, \n“What is missing is the examination of the characteristics of the dominant group itself, \nparticularly the nature of dominant group ethnic identity.” \nFinally, my examination of diversity constructions as programs might well \ncontribute to the empirical work on the issues of socialization within the workplace.  This \nis sociologically important in that these programs essentially serve as initiatives for the \n41 \n“conduct of conduct” (Rose 1996) and arguably invoke the ideal of respecting difference \nin persons while coordinating sameness in behavior for the benefit of capitalist \nexpansion.\n42 \n \n \n \n \nReferences \n \n \nBarthes, Roland (1972).

    "abstract": "This is a study of  workplace diversity  from a social constructionist perspective. The perspective holds that while human meaning is socially created, it is the social order which gives us resources for making this meaning. There is much literature about workplace diversity from objectivist standpoints that takes for granted the term  diversity.  What is missing is a comprehensive understanding of diversity: what does this term mean? What does it conceal? I attempt to contribute to a better understanding of diversity by interrogating its construction in popular culture.\nI analyze the content of an advertising supplement called  Diversity Works,  published in the New York Times Sunday Magazine, with a literal read to learn how diversity is manifestly constructed on the surface as well as how it is typified through formula stories. Diversity is ideally defined as programs for creating a  culture of inclusion,  but practical efforts imply normative attempts to assimilate persons designated as diverse to the standards imposed by the dominant group.\nI argue that claims about diversity act to construct collective identity for certain types of people thereby reinforcing their subordinate positions among the social hierarchy. As constructed, the social goodness of diversity is taken for granted, yet by its narrow typification reproduces race and gender divisions and accompanying inequalities. In practice, diversity is an alternate term for the other, the type of person who is not a member of the highly valued and socially privileged dominant group of white (Anglo) men. I suggest that diversity is linked to larger structures of domination evidenced by its construction as agents of social engineering existing to help certain types of people -- women and minorities.\nMy analysis offers potential contributions to diversity scholarship by attending to issues of power and dominance as they are constructed and interpreted in popular culture. Further, I contribute to a dialogue about power and dominance relations between identity groups. Finally, this study contributes to empirical work on the issues of socialization in the workplace. As constructed, diversity programs invoke the ideal of respecting difference in persons while coordinating sameness in behavior for the benefit of capitalist expansion",
