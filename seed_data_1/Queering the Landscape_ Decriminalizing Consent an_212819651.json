Trans people of color face increasingly high rates of discrimination in seeking housing and employment leading many trans individuals to turn to sex work2 or engage in survival sex.3                                                           © 2019 Emily Yost * J.D. candidate, 2020, University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.

While some trans individuals identify within the gender binary, others do not. See The Language of Gender, GENDER SPECTRUM, https://www.genderspectrum.org/the-language-of-gender/ (last visited May 5, 2019). For the purpose of this argument, I will not address “transgender” and “gender non-conforming” individuals as distinct entities. Though it is important to note that these are often simultaneously-held identities by gender-expansive folks who implicitly reject binary conceptions of gender, regardless of how individuals actually iden-tify, many transgender people are societally perceived to be inherently “gender non-conform-ing,” and thus are subject to heightened scrutiny and surveillance on the basis of their gender presentation and expression. For some transgender individuals, “passing” as cisgender is a de-sirable identity goal, in part because of the protection the presumption of cis-ness carries.  This is particularly true for some trans women who engage in sex work, who are more likely to be targets for transphobic violence on the basis of their visibility, gender identities and gender presentation. Discussed, infra Part IV-B. 2 Carol Leigh, a sex worker and advocate for sex workers’ rights, is first credited with coining the term “sex work” - in response to her feminist contemporaries’ use of the term “sex use industry” in the late 1970s. While anti-trafficking rhetoricians continue to use the term “prosti-tution,” the use of the term sex work contextualizes discussions by centering the commercial, capitalist nature of the labor being performed.

A study of sex workers found that 24.4% of transgender people of color turned to sex work as a means of financially supporting themselves, when only 6.3% of white transgender participants reported engaging in sex work.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 With the passing of the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (“FOSTA”)4 which effectively banned digital expressions of sexuality coupled by the rapid gentrification of urban spaces, TGNC sex workers are being simultaneously physically and virtually displaced, exposing this already vulnerable population to additional physical harm.5 In the one year since the passage of FOSTA, Maryland has mourned the sense-less murders of two Black6 trans women.7 For these reasons, while this comment will analyze the adverse effects that provisions of the Mary-land Criminal Code and current Baltimore City practices and policies carry for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (“LGBTQIA+”) and sex worker communities, the discussion will focus primarily on the disparate harms exacted upon the trans, gender non-conforming, and nonbinary population, particularly the TGNC sex worker community.  INTRODUCTION Maryland Code criminalizes consensual sodomy in blatant contradiction to the Supreme Court’s 2003 ruling in Lawrence v. Texas,8 which invalidated statutes criminalizing private, consensual sex nationwide.9 The crime of “unnatural or perverted sexual practices,” encompassing all oral and anal acts, further affiliates carceral punishment with consensual intimacy.10 In Baltimore City, the police                                                           Is Central for Gender Equity, Public Health, and Racial Justice, MEDIUM (Nov. 14, 2018) https://medium.com/seventhirty-dc/why-decriminalizing-sex-work-is-central-for-gender-eq-uity-public-health-and-racial-justice-63549237e36b.

YOST   2019] QUEERING THE LANDSCAPE 203 have been censured by federal government for their pattern and practice of abusing sexually and gender diverse civilians.11  In an increasingly transphobic12 post-FOSTA political landscape, where expressions of  sexuality and gender identity are being virtually policed,13 the retention of these unconstitutional statutes and policies serve no legitimate, legal function.  Beyond instilling a sense of “otherness,” states’ sodomy stat-utes might  be used to justify unwarranted surveillance of those already subject to heightened policing, particularly the LGBTQIA+ and sex worker communities.14 Absent a complete repeal of the sodomy and “unnatural or perverse sexual practices” statutes, Maryland’s Criminal Code will disparately impact the queer community, specifically TGNC individuals whose mere existence is often perceived to be “unnatural.”15 In addition to repealing these provisions and re-enacting with amend-ments all other portions of the criminal code referring to sodomy as an initial measure of solidarity with the LGBTQIA+ community, this com-ment argues that the Maryland legislature, in conjunction with grass-roots organizations, should coordinate the employment of extra-legisla-tive remedial measures to prevent future abuse.16   Part II of this paper will lay out the evolution of privacy rights and gradual decriminalization of sexuality in America as reflected by judicial decisions.17 Part III of this paper will focus on Maryland’s cur-rent legislative landscape and the impact of statutory constructions on our conception of gender, sexuality, and victimhood.18 Part IV will ex-amine the City of Baltimore’s problematic relationship with local TGNC and sex worker communities and the current crisis arising from the simultaneous physical gentrification of Northern Baltimore and vir-tual gentrification of digital platforms.19 Part V will look towards other                                                           11 See infra Part IV-A.  12 Transphobia is the “fear, hatred, disbelief, or mistrust of people who are transgender, thought to be transgender, or whose gender expression doesn’t conform to traditional gender roles.” What’s Transphobia, PLANNED PARENTHOOD, https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sex-ual-orientation-gender/trans-and-gender-nonconforming-identities/whats-transphobia (last vis-ited May 6, 2019). 13 See infra Part IV. 14 See id. 15 “For a long time hermaphrodites were criminals, or crime’s offspring, since the anatomical disposition, their very being confounded the law that distinguished the sexes and prescribed their union.” MICHAEL FOUCAULT, Repressive Hypothesis, in THE HISTORY OF SEXUALITY VOL. 1: AN INTRODUCTION 38 (Robert Hurley trans., Vintage Books 2d ed. 1990) (1976).

PRIVATE PARTS: FROM WILLIAMS TO LAWRENCE: STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION OF SEXUALITY The American legal system has long recognized the individual right to reproductive sexual autonomy as a privilege attaching to straight marriage21 and heteronormativity22 tied up within the physical bounda-ries of property.23 Over the past half-century, these seminal cases have provided a roadmap for redefining the right to be intimate absent gov-ernmental or regulatory interference, regardless of sexual orientation or marital status; however, legal protections for sexual privacy are still largely site-specific.24 While the extent to which public performances of intimacy and displays of sexuality beyond the bedroom may be consti-tutionally protected remains unclear, the evolving judicial recognition of sexual autonomy seemingly parallels what can and cannot be practi-cally policed.25 Given the interplay between gender identity and sexual-ity,26 absent a definitive Supreme Court ruling opening up the umbrella of sexual privacy rights, individuals whose gender non-conformity is                                                           20 See infra Part V. 21 Perez v. Sharp, 32 Cal. 2d 711, 713–15 (Cal. 1948) (affirming heterosexual couples’ right to choose their marital partners). 22 Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 195–96 (1986) (permitting the criminalization of sodomy for same-sex couples only, while acknowledging the right of heterosexual couples to engage in oral or anal sex). 23 Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S.  479, 484–85 (1965) (identifying the “sacred precincts” of the marital bedroom and “penumbras” of privacy within one’s own home as spaces protected from government interference). 24 The term “site-specific,” though typically used to describe location-based sculpture and in-stallation art, here refers to the geography of permissible intimacy. See generally Griswold, 381 U.S. 479; Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 578 (2003). 25 Logically, absent surveillance, private, consensual conduct between adults cannot be conven-iently regulated. See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578; infra Part IV-A. 26 Gender identity, or an individual’s “deeply held internal sense of self,” or gender alignment is not to be confused with sexual orientation – the gender(s) one is attracted to sexually, or romantically. See The Language of Gender, supra note 1. While gender identity and sexual orientation are certainly distinct, these aspects of individuals’ identities often inform one an-other. Id. Genderfluidity and the act of transitioning from one gender expression or gender iden-tity to another may accompany a shift in an individual’s self-identified sexual orientation, or in the sexual orientation of their partners, for instance.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 A. A Brief History of Sodomy The criminalization of sodomy originates in biblical moralism, drawing linguistic roots prior to the thirteenth century.35 Though con-sidered to be “too disgusting to be defined,”36 and a “detestable, abom-inable sin . . . not to be named,”37 Black’s Law Dictionary dares to iden-tify sodomy as “oral or anal copulation between humans, esp[ecially] those of the same sex,”38 or, in the alternate, “oral or anal copulation between a human and an animal; bestiality.”39 Early American judiciar-ies adopted the English common law definition, filling the regulatory gaps of then-current criminal codes, manufacturing grounds to prose-cute nonconsensual conduct on behalf of individuals not able to bring suit themselves.40 While the common law construction of sodomy tar-geted otherwise predatory, nonconsensual sexual acts—namely rape, assault, child abuse and molestation41—around the turn of the century, American sodomy statutes were broadened to include all forms of oral sex, consensual or otherwise.42   The gradual decriminalization of consensual, non-procreative sex began at a state level in the 1950s in response to the American Law Institute’s 1955 exclusion of sodomy from the Model Penal Code.43 The decriminalization trend carried into the 1970s, influenced by the Su-preme Court’s expansive embrace of privacy rights relating to sexual                                                           35 “Sodomy” is traced to middle English, from Anglo-French sodomie, from the medieval Latin sodomia, or peccatum Sodomiticum, referring to the reported homosexuality reported in Genesis 19:5 as occurring in Sodom, an ancient Palestinian town.

The Pre-Lawrence Era: Williams v. State Shortly following Bowers, Maryland’s Court of Appeals decriminalized non-procreative, private consensual sexual encounters for heterosexual adults.52 In Schochet,53 the Court concluded that Maryland’s unnatural sexual practices statute could not be reasonably read to criminalize consensual, noncommercial heterosexual intimacy occuring within the home.54 A decade following the decision, a plaintiff                                                           44 Id. at 16–17. 45 See generally Angela Perone, From Punitive to Proactive: An Alternative Approach for Re-sponding to HIV Criminalization that Departs from Penalizing Marginalized Communities, 24 HASTINGS WOMEN’S L.J. 363 (2013) (studying the “panicked,” regressive legislation punishing both the intentional and unintentional transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus). 46 Bowers v.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 class of attorneys barred in Maryland challenged the constitutionality of Maryland’s lingering sodomy statute.55 The plaintiffs cited their particularized exposure to potential future harm and discrimination as adults of varying gender identities and sexual orientations engaging in consensual, non-procreative sex acts.56 In an unpublished decision, presiding District Court Judge Richard Rombro invalidated the sodomy statute, ruling it facially unconstitutional.57 Despite this finding, no conclusive remedial action has been taken judicially or legislatively in the state since 1999,58 when Williams set the stage for the national shift towards recognizing consensual, sexual intimacy proffered by Lawrence.59 C. Fifty Shades of Privacy: Lawrence v. Texas, and Constitutional Limitations on Regulating Intimacy Four years after Maryland’s sodomy statute was declared unconstitutional, the Supreme Court revisited the subject of state sodomy laws, reversing Bowers60 and narrowly determining that consensual, noncommercial sexual conduct occurring within the protections of the home is beyond the scope of state police powers and not subject to government regulation.61 Drawing from well-established privacy protections against State surveillance and policing which attaches to domestic intimacy,62 the Lawrence Court concluded that enforcing the Texas sodomy statute would inevitably and impermissibly violate individuals’ Due Process rights.63 Building upon a legal foundation centering long-recognized fundamental values of marital privacy, homeownership, and individual autonomy, Lawrence contours                                                           55 Williams v.

In Williams, a plaintiff class of gay and heterosexual Maryland attorneys who openly stated that they enjoyed engaging in oral sex challenged the state’s sodomy and unnatural sexual practices statute, presenting various claims to ensure they as a group, would have standing, namely: that their livelihoods as attorneys of various sexual orientations were threatened by the potential of criminal charges being filed against them for otherwise consensual adult encounters.

CRIMINALIZING OTHERNESS: THE SOCIOPOLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF POLICING CONSENSUAL CONDUCT Despite the oft-promised separation of church and state, the in-terests historically represented by the legal system reflect a singular per-spective of morality: those of whiteness, heterosexuality, maleness, and Christian values.72 The default to cisgendered,73 hetero-masculinity is mirrored in the ubiquitous use of gendered language in statutory con-structions, or in the alternative, language which presumes gender-con-formity.74 Through the use of gender essentialist language and the  crim-inalization of queer sex,75 the State targets those “others” deemed undeserving of the guarantees of privacy, liberty, free exercise, equal protection, and due process, subjecting its sexually and gender diverse populations to unconstitutional policing.76 By retaining statutory lan-guage tainted with gendered assumptions and narrowly construed con-ceptions of sexuality, Maryland’s laws render its gender diverse citizens less deserving of protection. A. Recent Attempts at Legislative Reform in Maryland In the wake of the Lawrence decision, the Maryland House of Delegates sought to reconstruct the sodomy and unnatural practices statutes as an alternative to striking the laws in their entirety.77 Instead of outright repeal, the proposed revisions created a narrow exception “for private consensual noncommercial sexual activity.”78 The bill would have decriminalized “noncommercial act[s] of sodomy that take place between consenting adults in private,”79 ensuring that the crime of “perverse” sexual practices would “not apply to a noncommercial                                                           72 See Letter from Thomas Jefferson, to Danbury Baptist Association (Jan. 1, 1802) (on file with Library of Congress).

CODE ANN., CRIM. LAW § 3-303(a)(1) (2019) (“A person may not . . . engage in vaginal intercourse with another by force, or the threat of force, without the consent of the other”). It is important to note that “consent in Maryland is not specifically defined.” See Consent Laws Maryland, RAINN (Dec. 2017), https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Maryland&group=9&_ga=2.82860127.839098241.1557193194-1014384513.1557193194. 94 CRIM. LAW § 3-301(d)(1). “Sexual acts” are defined to include analingus, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse “including penetration, however slight, of the anus; or an act in which an object or part of an individual’s body penetrates, however slightly, into another individual’s genital opening or anus; and that can be reasonably be construed to be for sexual arousal or gratification, or for the abuse of either party.” CRIM. LAW § 3-301(d)(1). 95 § 3-301(d)(1)(v) (including the penetration of any “genital opening” with an object or body part within the definition of “sexual act”). 96 § 3-301(d)(2) (noting that “sexual act” does not include vaginal intercourse or “an act in which an object or part of an individual’s body penetrates an individual’s genital opening or anus for an accepted medical purpose”). Instead, vaginal intercourse is retained as legally distinct “genital copulation.” § 3-301(g) (“‘Vaginal intercourse’ means genital copulation, whether or not semen is emitted . . . [and] includes penetration, however slight, of the vagina.”). 97 Relying on the principle of ejusdem generis the distinguishing of intercourse from other forms of penetration within the definition of sexual acts and vaginal intercourse (“vaginal intercourse means genital copulation, whether or not semen is emitted”) and subsequent references to ejac-ulation suggest the legislature’s intent to refer solely to organic, phallic penetration. See CRIM. LAW § 3-301(g)(1). This inference is further supported by the arbitrary separation of anal inter-course (“including penetration, however slight of the anus”) from “an act in which an object or part of an individual’s body penetrates, however slightly, into another’s . . . anus.” § 3-301(d)(1)(iv)-(v).  98 See, e.g., D.C. CODE ANN. § 22-3002(a) (2019) (eradicating the distinction between rape and other forms of sexual assault in favor of a singular “First degree sexual abuse” charge and ren-dering its criminal code sex-neutral). The District of Columbia also defines “sexual acts” to include oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by a penis, or anal or vaginal penetration “by a hand or finger, or any object, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.” D.C. CODE § 22-3001(8) (2019); see also CRIM. LAW § 3-301(g) (defining vaginal intercourse). YOST  214 U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 and all other nonconsensual sexual acts while retaining both definitions with legally indistinct, parallel punishments, Maryland’s legislature demonstrates its refusal to acknowledge gender divergence.99  The segregation of vaginal intercourse, or “genital copulation” from all other forms of sexual encounters, many of which, by statutory definition involve the use of one or more individuals’ genitals, infers a hierarchical view of what “sex” is and is not100—cementing into law presumptions of cissexism and heterosexuality.101 The othering of non-procreative sex is further supported by the statute’s differing evidentiary burden for rapes which defy the heterosexist presumption of phallic penetration,102 “in which an object or a part of an individual’s body penetrates, however slightly, into another individual’s genital opening or anus,” requiring additional corroborating proof that the act was carried out for the purposes of “sexual arousal or gratification, or for the abuse of either party.”103 While these definitions do recognize the fluidity of potential abuse of power, allowing for either party—the penetrator or the penetrated—to be in violation of the statute, the State forces upon people without vaginas104 or survivors of sexual assaults                                                           99 The possible underlying legislative intent behind excluding vaginal intercourse from the legal definition of a “sexual act” is further confused upon reviewing the definitions for first- and second-degree rape offenses. While the provision for “rape in the first degree” compartmental-izes vaginal intercourse and all other “sexual acts” into separate sub-sections ((a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)), the provision for “rape in the second degree” lumps together both definitions under one subheading. Compare CRIM. LAW § 3-303(a)(1)(i)-(ii), with CRIM. LAW § 3-304(a)(1). Fur-ther, neither provision offers distinct criminal punishments for either activity when committed in violation of the title. Id. 100 As a former sex educator, I am of the mindset that every individual ought to be able to define what sex is and is not for themselves; however, as a law student, I understand the necessity of clear-cut definitions and guidelines with which to regulate. Narrowly defining “sex” or “inter-course” to be inclusive of only traditionally, procreative sexual acts or a predetermined range of acts or possible combinations of assigned or acquired body parts, however, is equally problem-atic. 101 “Cissexism” (a compound of “cisgender” and “sexism”) is prejudice or discrimination against transgender people. Cissexism, OXFORD DICTIONARIES, https://en.oxforddictionar-ies.com/definition/cissexism (last visited May 6, 2019). Maryland’s statute’s narrow definition of penile penetration as “intercourse” presumes both that people assigned male at birth (AMAB), or born with penises engage in penetrative anal or vaginal sex, and that this form of sexual intimacy is worthy of being legally distinct from all other, lesser, “sexual acts.” CRIM. LAW § 3-301(d)(1). 102 Regardless of the phallic narrative of penetrative sex as a “primary” sex act, the legal defini-tion of sexual act presumes as a default that one or both parties in violation of the statute will have penises. CRIM. LAW § 3-301(d)(1) (“Sexual act means any of the following acts, regardless of whether semen is emitted.”) (emphasis added). 103 CRIM.

Instead, the current law criminalizes queer sex as “unnatural,” conflating consensual sexual acts with nonconsensual violence.107   IV.

V. ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: REPEALS AND REMEDIES A. Maryland’s Sodomy and “Unnatural” Sexual Practices Statutes Unconstitutionally Criminalize Consensual Conduct Given the facial unconstitutionality and inefficiency of the sodomy and unnatural sexual practices statutes, the Maryland legislature should mirror other states’ actions and repeal these provisions. As acknowledged by the Maryland Court of Appeals  over 40 years ago, there is no reasonable justification for the retention of the sodomy statute, given the exhaustive definition of sexual acts otherwise criminalized within previous and subsequent provisions of Maryland’s Code.186 Nor does the State need to retain arbitrary legal distinctions between intercourse and penetration.187 Post-Lawrence, the retention of both the sodomy and unnatural sexual practices statutes and their                                                           184 “Many LGBTQ people’s posts have been blocked recently for using words like “dyke,” “fag,” or “tranny” to describe ourselves and our communities.” Dottie Lux & Lil Miss Hot Mess, FaceBook’s Hate Speech Policies Censor Marginalized Users, WIRED (Aug. 4, 2017, 7:00 am) https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-hate-speech-policies-censor-marginalized-users/  185 Megan Farokmanesh, YouTube is Still Restricting and Demonetizing LGBT Videos — and Adding Anti-LGBT Ads to Some, THE VERGE (June 4, 2018 2:46 pm) https://www.thev-erge.com/2018/6/4/17424472/youtube-lgbt-demonetization-ads-algorithm (noting the inclusion of the word “trans” triggers demonetization of Youtube videos); Jesselyn Cook, Instagram’s Shadow Ban On Vaguely ‘Inappropriate’ Content is Plainly Sexist, HUFFINGTON POST (Apr. 29, 2019 7:04 pm) https://www.huffpost.com/entry/instagram-shadow-ban-sex-ist_n_5cc72935e4b0537911491a4f (“Anybody who is taking ownership of their sexuality and being comfortable with their body even in a nonsexual way is being silenced for it.”). 186 Discussed supra, note 92. 187 See supra Part III-B.

Despite the facially performative creation of new positions within Baltimore City government for LGBTQIA+ community mem-bers,190 the State's continued use of the “trans panic” defense191 belies the belief that an individual’s gender diversity is a sufficient legal justi-fication for unprovoked violence against them.192 Where any identity or practice commonly affiliated with an affinity group can be legally deemed “unnatural,” the State can be construed as encouraging its po-licing, effectively targeting visibly gender-non-conforming individuals within the community.

The report indicated that in the mid-aughts, eighty-five percent of sex work in the United States was conducted indoors.203 Logically, then, post-FOSTA, when a higher percentage of sex and sex-adjacent work has been virtually displaced, leading more workers to take to the streets, decriminalizing indoor sex work would likely invite an even higher im-mediate decrease in rates of nonconsensual sexual violence and STI transmission, along with a marked decrease in homicide rates.204  In the United Kingdom, a unique pilot program called “Housing First,” provides long-term stable housing to sex working women, as a basis for addressing the intersecting stigmas and barriers to support that sex workers face.205 While the UK has not yet fully decriminalized sex work and recently enacted its own version of SESTA/FOSTA,206 this model approach centers harm reduction and access to healthcare, mental healthcare, and drug dependency treatment in supporting women who engage in sex work.207 The program, which is inclusive of both cis-gender and transgender women, recognizes that homelessness is often a triggering event leading to survival sex work.208 Housing First claims to empower its tenants to make informed choices – not by encouraging them to give up sex work, but rather to choose to engage in safer sex work practices – such as “home-based” or indoor sex work at their ten-ancies, as a lower-risk option.209 As another part of their harm reduction                                                           201 Id.

Reparatory Actions: Decriminalizing Survival, Redistributing Resources, and Instituting Tipplezones in Baltimore In light of the national crisis of hate directed towards gender non-conformity and the recent attempts to collapse the legal definition of gender to a biological sexual binary,214 Maryland should take immediate steps towards protecting its trans and gender expansive community from unnecessary violence. First, the Maryland legislature must repeal the sodomy and unnatural sexual practices statutes and repeal and re-enact with amendments all other provisions of the criminal code which refer to “sodomy.”215 Given the low conviction rates associated with charging individuals for violating sections 3-322 and 3-323, the legislature need not create new sex crimes. Additionally, Maryland should look towards the District of Columbia’s model, removing the trappings of gender essentialism from the rape and sexual abuse statutes, consolidating the definition of such crimes, and                                                           210 Id. at 24–25 (discussing flaws with the “sometimes punitive system that is embedded within tenancy management.”).  211 Frazer Crichton, Perspectives on public health and sex work in New Zealand, MEDIUM (Jul. 4, 2017) https://medium.com/@fraser.crichton/faces-behind-the-voices-health-b022a0e4c8ff; Prostitution Reform Act 2003.  212 Id.    213 The New Zealand Model, NEW ZEALAND PROSTITUTES’ COLLECTIVE, https://www.nzpc.org.nz/The-New-Zealand-Model (last visited May 25, 2019).  214 Green et al., supra note 108; Jan, supra note 108; WATERS, ET AL., supra note 109.

To address the ongoing conflict with those most highly policed, efforts should be dedicated to mitigating hostility and violence directed towards TGNC people of color and other gender divergent individuals working and living in the rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods surround-ing the Station North area. Though proponents of SPDP believe that full decriminalization of sex work in Maryland is “unfeasible,” they also recognize that the program would be defunct if systems were in place that met citizens’ basic survival needs. 217 While international human rights organizations call for a full decriminalization of sex work, by de-criminalizing indoor sex work entirely or enacting de facto decriminal-ized zones for indoor work, Baltimore City would reduce the frequency of potentially invasive police interactions with TGNC individuals and sex workers, taking steps towards compliance with the Consent De-cree’s requirements.218   By creating legal venues removed from police surveillance, de-criminalizing indoor sex work would undoubtedly mitigate some of the harms experienced by trans community members and sex workers. However, decriminalizing indoor work alone would not necessarily benefit those most marginalized as the LGBTQ+ community, particu-larly trans persons of color, experience overwhelmingly high rates of homelessness.219 New proposed rules, which could allow federally-funded shelters to deny transgender individuals access to sex-segregated facilities, would only further this divide.220 Baltimore street workers re-port “a dire an ongoing need for material assistance,” prioritizing access to physical and mental health care, substance use treatment, support                                                           216 See supra note 98 and accompanying text. 217 Shdaimah, supra note 129 at 104, 108.  218 See supra Part IV-A. 219 FITZGERALD ET AL., supra note 2, at 14; MARYLAND STATE REPORT, supra note 109 at 1–2.

While it is unlikely the City of Baltimore would directly appro-priate funds delineated for community use by the recently passed Af-fordable Housing Land Trust Act222 for the creation of tippelzones, Bal-timore non-profits supporting the LGBTQIA+ and sex working communities could collaborate with pre-existing land trusts—or form trusts of their own—and apply for grant funding to subsidize housing for qualifying clients, prioritizing TGNC folks who engage in street work  and are in need of housing. By utilizing this existing framework, Baltimore non-profits could directly provide individual community members with tenancies not unlike the Housing First pilot program. Grants should be allocated to grassroots organizations led by people with lived experiences, such as SWOP, to acquire physical property and negotiate for official areas of diminished surveillance in Baltimore.  While repealing the sodomy and unnatural sexual practices statute is a necessary step forward, to successfully address the needs of Maryland’s TGNC community, any push for the legislative reform of criminal codes must be coupled with tangible, practical, extra-judicial reparatory measures, decriminalizing queerness and prioritizing the creation and preservation of spaces where gender variant individuals can safely exist.                                                             221 Shdaimah & Bailey-Koch, supra note 133 at 267.  222 MD.
