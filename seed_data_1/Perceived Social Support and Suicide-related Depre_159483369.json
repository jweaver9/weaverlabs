Certain \ndepressive symptoms and symptom clusters, namely hopelessness and self-blame, are \npredictive of suicidal behavior and outcomes. In contrast, perceived social support may \nact as a buffer against suicide ideation. The disparity in the rate of queer suicidality may \nbe predicted by higher rates of hopelessness and self-blame, as well as lower rates of \nperceived social support among depressed queer youth in comparison to depressed non-\nqueer youth. The current study will test this hypothesis using a sample of depressed queer \nand non-queer college students (n=145).  \nResults indicate that queer students and non-queer students do not experience \nsignificantly different rates of hopelessness, self-blame, or perceived social support. \nDespite this finding, queer students report significantly higher rates of suicide and self-\nharm ideation. This suggests that differences in the suicide rate for queer individuals \ncannot be explained by differences in perceived social support or the manifestation of \nsuicide-related depression symptom clusters. Additionally, depression severity was found \nto be a weaker predictor of suicide ideation for queer students than for non-queer \nstudents. This indicates that suicidality among queer populations may be less connected \nto experiences of depressive symptoms than it is for cisgender and heterosexual \npopulations. Further research is needed to examine possible suicide predictors and risk \nfactor differences that are unique to queer populations to explain the disparity in suicide \nrates.  \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n5 \n \nPerceived Social Support and Suicide-related Depression Symptom Clusters among \nQueer College Students \nIntroduction \n LGBTQIA+ individuals are at a heightened risk for Major Depressive Disorder \nand other mental illnesses compared to heterosexual and cisgender people. Current \nresearch indicates that queer people are nearly three times more likely to develop Major \nDepressive Disorder over their lifetimes (Lee, Oliffe, Kelly & Ferlatte, 2017). Further \nextant research suggests that LGBTQ+ youth are particularly vulnerable, with estimates \nthat queer youth are approximately 6 times more likely to experience depressive \nsymptoms than the general population (NAMI; Marshal, Dietz, Friedman, Stall, Smith, \nMcGinley, & Brent, 2011; Russell & Fish, 2016). A number of different theories for this \ndisparity have been offered, primarily focusing on queer youth experiencing higher levels \nof discrimination and social stigma. The minority stress theory contends that minorities, \nin this case queer individuals, experience severe and chronic stress brought on by \nfrequently encountering discrimination and prejudice (Meyer, 2003).  \nFor queer youth, this prejudice often affects multiple facets of daily life as young \npeople face stigma at home as well as at school, where they are at an elevated risk for \nbullying and harassment. Bullying directed at queer youth is so severe that a 2013 report \nby the Gay, Lesbian, & Straight Education Network found that 55% of “out” queer youth \nfeel unsafe at their school due to their sexual orientation, and 74%  reported experiencing \nsome form of verbal harassment from their classmates concerning their sexual orientation \n(Kosciw, Greytak, Palmer & Boesen, 2014). \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n6 \n \n. This bullying has a direct impact on mental health. Research has indicated that \nperceived discrimination leads to an increase in depressive symptoms among queer youth \nand can lead to an elevated risk for suicide and self-harm (Almeida, Johnson, Corliss, \nMolnar, & Azrael, 2009).  \nPerceived discrimination may also drive queer youth to engage in unhealthy \ncoping methods, including substance abuse. A 2008 meta-analysis found that sexual \nminority youth (SMY) report significantly higher rates of alcohol and illegal substance \nuse than do heterosexual youth, which are also correlated with an increase in depressive \nsymptoms (Marshal et al., 2008). Additionally, social stigma against queer individuals \nextends beyond interpersonal interactions. Institutional prejudice also affects mental \nhealth, and both depression and substance abuse rates among LGBT people significantly \nincrease following the introduction and adoption of new legislation that discriminates \nagainst queer individuals (Hatzenbuehler, McLaughlin, Keyes, & Hasin, 2010).  \nThese disparities in both Major Depressive Disorder and Substance Use Disorder \nrates also contribute to perhaps an even more severe problem: suicide among queer \nyouth. According to the Center for Disease Control & Prevention, lesbian, gay, and \nbisexual youth are 3 times as likely to seriously contemplate suicide and are 5 times as \nlikely to actually attempt to kill themselves compared to similarly-aged heterosexual \npeers (CDC, 2016). These statistics are even more substantial for transgender youth, with \na national study finding that 40% of transgender adults reported having made a suicide \nattempt during their adolescence (James, Herman, Rankin, Keisling, Mottet, & Anafi, \n2016). By comparison, only 4.6% of the general U.S. population reported an attempt at \nany point across their lifetime. There is, however, little research on transgender suicide \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n7 \n \nattempts and this statistic only includes those whose attempts were unsuccessful. Not \nonly are queer youth significantly more likely to attempt suicide, but their attempts are \noften more serious, being 4 to 6 times more likely to require emergency medical services \nthan attempts by heterosexual and cisgender youth (CDC, 2016). Despite this seeming \nepidemic, there is still a relative dearth of research examining queer suicide and \ndepression.  \nSymptom Clusters \nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 of Mental Disorders (DSM 5) take a \nbroad approach to understanding Major Depressive Disorder, conceptualizing it as a \nsingle diagnosis with a number of possible symptoms. However, research has shown that \ndepression may not be so homogenous, manifesting itself in different ways and with \ndifferent symptoms for different people (Martin, Neighbors, & Griffith, 2013). According \nto the DSM-5, one need only experience five of nine listed symptoms to meet the criteria \nfor a diagnosis of a Major Depressive Episode, meaning that two individuals could share \nthe same diagnosis, but experience only one symptom in common (American Psychiatric \nAssociation, 2013).  \nThere has been a recent push within the field of depression research to begin \nconceptualizing it as a more heterogeneous disorder, focusing on individual symptoms \nand symptom clusters rather than just a single diagnosis (Insel, 2014). Research has \nindicated that certain depression symptoms and symptom clusters, such as self-blame or \nsleep disturbances, are more predictive of prognosis and treatment efficacy than the \ndepression diagnosis itself (Checkroud, Gueorguieva, Krumholz, Trivedi, Krystal, & \nMcCarthy, 2017). For example, depressed individuals who primarily manifest symptoms \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n8 \n \nin the “core emotional” cluster, such as loss of interest and feelings of worthlessness, \nrespond better on average to psychopharmacological interventions than people who \nprimarily manifest “atypical” symptoms such as psychomotor slowing or hypersomnia \n(Checkroud et al., 2017).  \nAdditionally, symptom cluster research is becoming increasingly common in \npsychopharmacology research, as certain antidepressants are more effective in the \ntreatment of specific symptom clusters (Lin & Stevens, 2014). While norepinephrine \ndopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRI’s) are particularly effective at treating depression \nwith high rates of fatigue, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI’s) are more \neffective for depressed patients who experience comorbid anxious symptoms (Lin & \nStevens, 2014). As professionals gain a better understanding of the distinctions and \nsimilarities between symptom clusters like sleep disturbances and anxious depression, \npsychiatrists will be better able to provide effective therapeutic interventions.  \nSuicide-related Symptom Clusters \nSymptom cluster manifestation may also serve as a useful tool to predict suicidal \nand self-injurious behaviors and outcomes. A growing body of research has established \nthat hopelessness, a cognitive symptom of depression, is one of the primary mediators \nbetween Major Depressive Disorder and suicidal ideation and behavior (Weishaar & \nBeck, 2009). A seminal 1973 study found that hopelessness was a better indicator of \nsuicidal intent than depression itself, and that directly addressing hopelessness may be a \nmore effective means of preventing a suicidal outcome than simply treating depression \nmore generally (Minkoff, Bergman, Beck & Beck, 1973). This finding has been \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n9 \n \ninstrumental to the field of suicide research, and many studies use hopelessness scales \nrather than depression inventories to assess for possible suicidal ideation (Beck & Steer, \n1988).  \nMore recently, another depression symptom cluster has emerged as a strong \nindicator of suicidal intent. Multiple studies have found that excessive feelings of guilt \ncoupled with inappropriate self-blame, are highly correlated with suicide ideation \n(Fountoulakis, 2013; Mcgirr, Renaud, Seguin, Alda, Benkelfat, Lesage & Turecki, 2007). \nAdditionally, stronger feelings of guilt mediated the relationship between suicidal \nindividuals who actually made an attempt to take their lives and those who did not, \nimplying that guilt and self-blame may be an underlying symptom that leads from \nsuicidal ideation to behavior (Mcgirr et al., 2007).  \nPerceived Social Support \nIn contrast to self-blame and guilt, Perceived Social Support may act as a critical \nprotective factor against both depression and suicidal behavior. Extant literature points to \nthe importance of social support as a coping method and as a buffer against stressful life \nevents and depressive or anxious symptoms (Barrera, 1986). Social support, or the \nfeeling of being loved, valued, and cared for by the people in one’s life, can be either \nenacted or perceived. On the one hand, enacted social support refers to tangible \ndemonstrations of support in the form of assistance from others during a stressful period \nof event. On the other hand, perceived social support, is the confident belief that one \nwould receive support if it were ever needed. Many conceptions of perceived social \nsupport focus on both the perceived availability and adequacy of one’s supportive \nrelationships (Barrera,1986). While enacted social support may seem integral to one’s \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n10 \n \nwell-being, research has shown that perceived social support is more highly correlated \nwith positive mental health outcomes (Taylor, Sherman, Kim, Jarcho, Takagi, & \nDunagan, 2004).  \nAccording to the buffering hypothesis, perceived social support is able to protect \nan individual from the negative effects of stressful events, thereby buffering them against \npoor health outcomes (Cohen & Wills, 1985). Perceived social support may change how \na person thinks about and deals with a negative situation, leading to better problem \nsolving and less internalization of stress and frustration (Thoits, 1986). However, \nperceived social support has benefits even outside of stressful life events, and has direct \neffects on mental health regardless of stress levels (Uchino, 2009). Some researchers \nbelieve that both the buffering and direct effects of perceived social support can be \nexplained by improvements in emotion regulation. In both stressful and innocuous \ncircumstances, people who report feeling higher levels of perceived social support are \nable to more positively and more effectively regulate their emotions (Lakey, 2010). This \nemotion regulation may help buffer against suicide ideation and prevent ideation from \ndeveloping into suicidal behavior. Research has shown that youth with difficulties in \nemotional regulation are at increased suicide risk as they are less able to cope with \ndistressing events and emotions without developing suicidal thoughts (Rajappa, \nGallagher & Miranda, 2011). Higher levels of perceived social support may therefore \nprotect against suicide ideation by helping youth to develop positive emotional regulation \nstrategies and preventing stressful situations from leading to suicidal thoughts and \nbehavior.  \n \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n11 \n \nPerceived Social Support, Depression, and Suicide \nPerceived Social Support may also play an important role in protecting against \ndepression and suicidal ideation, as well as preventing ideation from becoming acted \nupon. Higher rates of perceived social support are negatively correlated with both \nhopelessness and guilt and self-blame (Pehlivan, Ovayolu, Ovayolu, Sevinc & Camci, \n2011; Roohafza, Afshar, Keshteli, Mohammadi, Feizi, Taslimi & Adibi, 2014). This may \nbe because individuals with high perceived social support are more likely to engage in \npositive coping methods, such as perspective taking and healthy re-framing of negative \nsituations. Research has also indicated that perceived social support can act as both a \ndirect and indirect buffer against suicidal ideation (Endo, Tachikawa, Fukuoka, Aiba, \nNemoto, Shiratori, & Asada, 2013). Conversely, a lack of perceived social support may \nincrease suicide risk. Individuals who suddenly lose support experience sharp increases in \nsuicide ideation (Endo, et al., 2013). Social support may act as a moderator between \nimpulsivity and suicidal behavior, meaning that without perceived social support, \nimpulsive individuals may have less control over their suicidal urges (Kleiman, Riskind, \nSchaefer & Weingarden, 2012).  \nUnfortunately, research on the relationship between symptom clusters that \nincrease suicidality and perceived social support that protects against it has largely been \nperformed on heterosexual and cisgender populations. A dearth of queer-specific suicide \nresearch has limited our understanding of how both depression and suicide ideation \nmanifest in queer communities. Although symptom and symptom cluster research has \nidentified differences in the experience of depression between ethnic and gender groups, \nsimilar research has yet to be conducted on possible differenced in the experience of \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n12 \n \ndepression across gender and sexual minorities. Numerous studies have shown that queer \npeople, especially youth, experience higher rates of depression, but the literature has yet \nto examine whether they demonstrate a propensity to experience different depression \nsymptom clusters than heterosexual and cisgender people. The literature has \ndemonstrated, however, that queer youth are at a significantly elevated risk of suicidal \nideation and behavior. If these especially harmful behaviors are correlated with certain \ndepressive symptom clusters (i.e. hopelessness and guilt and self-blame), then perhaps \nqueer people with Major Depressive Disorder may be predisposed to experience these \nspecific symptoms at higher rates than depressed non-queer individuals. Furthermore, if \nthese specific symptom clusters can be targeted for intervention, it may also lead to a \ndecrease in the overall suicide rate of queer individuals experiencing depression and \nbetter overall outcomes for this group.  \nPerceived Social Support among Queer Youth \nProtective factors such as Perceived Social Support may also be harder to develop \nfor queer youth who are in the process of forming their identities. Research has indicated \nthat many queer youth feel that they lack social support from multiple areas within their \nlife, including family and classmates (Munoz-Plaza, Quinn, & Rounds, 2002).  One study \nconducted with queer college students found that when they did feel social support, it \noften developed gradually over time rather than being immediately protective as it was \nfor heterosexual classmates (Snapp, Watson, Russell, Diaz & Ryan, 2015). Queer high \nschool students report lower than average perceived social support from family members, \nbut research shows that family support has a greater effect on the mental health outcomes \nof queer youth than non-queer youth (Munoz-Plaza et al., 2002; Snapp et al., 2015). Lack \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n13 \n \nof family support appears to be a more significant risk factor for queer youth, who may \nfeel especially dejected and isolated if the rejection is a result of their sexual orientation \nor gender identity. Even when queer students do report feeling social support, they \nperceive as qualitatively different than do heterosexual and cisgender students, believing \nit to be both more conditional and more limited (Munoz-Plaza et al., 2002). This implies \nthat while a lack of perceived social support may be especially harmful to queer youth, \npositive feelings of support may not offer the same range of beneficial effects that they \ndo for non-queer youth.  \nBoth the presence of suicide-related depressive symptom clusters and a lack of \nperceived social support may be contributing factors to the disparity in suicide rates \namong queer populations. Insufficient social support surrounding one’s sexual or gender \nidentity is strongly correlated with both suicidality and depression among LGBTQ+ \nyouth (Baams, Grossman & Russell, 2015). This implies that queer youth perceive less \nsupport as a direct result of their identity, which then directly contributes to feelings of \nisolation and hopelessness. Additionally, a recent British study found that LGBTQ+ \nstudents, who felt that they lacked the social support necessary to be able to talk about \ntheir emotional issues, were also at the highest risk for suicidal feelings and self-harm of \nany student demographic group (McDermott, Hughes & Rawlings, 2017). This indicates \nthat a lack of social support may be perhaps the greatest risk factors facing queer youth \n(McDermott, Hughes & Rawlings, 2017). Extant research has also demonstrated that \nexperiencing rejection due to sexual or gender orientation is so damaging to mental \nhealth that lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth who experience high levels of rejection from \ntheir families are 8.4 times as likely to attempt suicide compares to LGB peers with \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n14 \n \nsupportive families (Family Acceptance Project, 2009). Given the existing research on \nperceived social support differences among queer youth, a number of hypotheses can be \ngenerated about how support interacts with other risk and protective factors unique to \nqueer youth.  \nThe Present Research \nThe current investigation seeks to explore the disparity in suicide ideation and \nattempts among queer youth by examining differences in the manifestation of suicide-\nrelated symptom clusters and perceptions of social support among queer and non-queer \ncollege students. This study will examine whether LGBTQ+ students with depression \nexperience suicide-related symptom clusters at different rates than non-queer depressed \nstudents, and whether these differences are partially attributable to differences in \nperceived social support. \nPrimary Hypotheses \nH1: Queer students with Major Depressive Disorder will endorse hopelessness and self-\nblame symptom clusters at higher rates than depressed non-queer individuals. \nH2: Queer students with Major Depressive Disorder will report feeling lower levels of \nsocial support than depressed non-queer individuals. \nH3: Higher perceived social support will be negatively correlated with hopelessness and \nself-blame depressive symptom clusters. Further, these attributes will mediate the \nrelationship between sexual orientation and symptom cluster manifestation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n15 \n \nExploratory Hypotheses \nH4: There will be a significant interaction between sexuality and perceived social support \nby sexual orientation such that the positive effect of perceived social support on reducing \nhopelessness and self-blame symptom clusters will be greater for non-queer people than \nfor queer individuals.  \nMethod \nParticipants \nA sample of 217 undergraduate students from the Claremont Colleges, University \nof California Los Angeles, and University of Southern California was recruited online \nthrough social media platforms.  Individual participants were specifically asked to \nparticipate if they had experienced a period of depression lasting at least two weeks in the \nsix months before the study was conducted. 72 participants failed to meet the inclusion \ncriteria for moderate or severe depression, leaving 145 participants in the analysis.  \nOne hundred thirteen participants identified as cisgender women, 22 identified as \ncisgender men, and an additional 10 participants as either transgender or non-binary. \nParticipants’ ages ranged from 18 to 28 with a mean age of 20.3. The ethnic breakdown \nof the sample was: 46.2% White, 24.8% Asian or Pacific Islander, 9.0% Hispanic or \nLatinx, 6.0% Black or African American, and 13.8% Mixed ethnic background. 66 \nparticipants (45.5%) identified as heterosexual, with 12 participants (8.3%) identifying as \nhomosexual, 44 participants (30.3%) identifying as bisexual, and an additional 23 \nparticipants (15.9%) identifying with another sexual orientation (e.g., pansexual, asexual, \netc.).  \n \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n16 \n \nProcedure \n Participants were recruited via social media posts in both general university pages \nand campus-wide LGBTQ+ group pages inviting students of all sexual orientations and \ngender identities to participate in a brief study about experiences with mental health \nissues on college campuses for the chance to win a $75 Amazon gift card. To ensure \nrecruitment of queer participants, we contacted leaders of various queer networks and \norganizations on each campus and asked them to share the study with the members of \ntheir group. Participants were also invited to share the study with their friends and peers.  \nEach participant was informed that the study would contain questionnaires about \npersonal experiences with mental health issues while in college, and that it may include \nuncomfortable questions. Students were asked whether they had experienced a period of \ndepression lasting at least two weeks in the six months prior to the study. Those who said \nno were thanked for their time and did not complete the remainder of the survey. Those \nwho said yes and who chose to continue then completed a Depression Inventory \nquestionnaire in order to assess symptom cluster manifestation and another questionnaire \ndesigned to assess subjective perceptions of social support from friends and family \nmembers. The order in which these two questionnaires were presented was randomized to \nprevent order effects or any other biases.  \nUpon completion of the two questionnaires, participants were asked to provide \ndemographic information, including information about sexual orientation (e.g. \nheterosexual, bisexual, etc.) and gender identity (e.g., cisgender man, transgender \nwoman, etc.). If participants did not identify with any of the options provided, they had \nthe opportunity to write in their sexual orientation and gender identity. To minimize the \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n17 \n \nrisk of any distress or discomfort that may have arisen from completing the survey, a \npage listing mental health resources and hotlines was provided at the end of the survey. \nUpon completion of the survey, participants were given a link through which to submit \ntheir email in order to enter a raffle for a chance to win a $75 Amazon gift card. In the \ninterest of protecting confidentiality, the raffle was hosted on a different server than the \nsurvey so that email addresses can in no way be connected to a participant’s responses.  \nMaterials \nDepression Symptom Clusters. A 29-item depression scale based on constructs \nin Beck’s Depression Inventory and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BDI; Beck et al., \n1996, Beck, 1988) was developed for this study in order to assess the manifestation of \ndifferent symptom clusters (See Appendix A). Using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 \n(Rarely [ <1 day a week]) to 3 (Almost every day [5-7 days a week]), participants were \nasked to rate the frequency with which they had experienced different depressive \nsymptoms (e.g., “I feel like life will never get better”). Each item on the scale \ncorresponds to one of seven separate symptom clusters, and each symptom cluster is \noperationalized by multiple items on the scale. Mean scores for individual clusters, such \nas loss of pleasure (α = .872) and hopelessness (α = .778), were calculated for each \nparticipant. An overall depression score (α = .904) was also calculated by summing the \nscore for each of the 29 items, with higher scores indicating more severe \nsymptomatology. The depression scale used the same 4-point likert scale as Beck’s \nDepression Inventory, and severity categorizations were determined by applying similar \ncut-offs as the BDI based on percentage of total possible score. A score of 0-17 was \nconsidered a minimal range of depression, 17-30 is mild, 30-43 is moderate, and 43-87 is \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n18 \n \nconsidered severe. Only participants who indicated at least moderate depression (a score \nof 30) had their data included in the analysis.  \nPerceived Social Support.  Participants’ subjective perception of available social \nsupport was assessed with a 26-item scale consisting of items from the Multidimensional \nScale of Perceived Social Support (Zimet et al., 1988), Procidano’s Perceived Social \nSupport scale (Procidano & Heller, 2005), and 6 original items developed for this study \n(See Appendix B). On a 7-point likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 \n(Strongly Agree), participants rated their agreement with 26 statements about social \nsupport, such as “I can count on my friends when things go wrong,” and “My family \ngives me the moral support I need.” The 6 additional items were developed to gauge \nperceptions of negative judgment (e.g., “I often feel judged by my family”) and \nforgiveness (e.g., “My friends would forgive me if I did something that upset them”). \nMean scores were calculated for each of three subscales: perception of social support \nfrom family members (α = 938), from friends (α = .870), and from a “special person” \n(i.e., a romantic partner or an especially close friend) [α = .948] An average of scores \nacross all items was taken to give a general perceived social support score, with higher \nscores indicating greater perceived support (α = .925). \nFollow-up Resources. Conducting research with at-risk populations necessitates \nextra precaution, and after completion of the two questionnaires, participants were \ndirected to a page with links to mental health resources in order to minimize any negative \neffects of participating in the study, and to provide additional support to an at-risk \npopulation. Telephone numbers for national and local suicide, self-harm, and depression \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n19 \n \nhotlines were included, as well as links to different online resources and communities \n(See Appendix C).  \nResults \nDepression Symptom Clusters \nTo examine hypothesis 1 that queer students would report significantly higher \nrates of suicide-related symptom clusters, mean scores were examined for both \nhopelessness and guilt/self-blame. An independent-samples t-test was conducted to \ncompare hopelessness in queer and non-queer students. There was not a significant \ndifference on levels of hopelessness between queer  (M=2.69, SD=.634) and non-queer \n(M=2.55, SD=.767) students; t(143)=1.180, p = .240. Another independent-samples t-test \nindicated that there was also not a significant difference on levels of guilt/self-blame \nbetween queer  (M=2.94, SD=.670) and non-queer (M=2.86, SD=.634) students; \nt(143)=.739, p = .461. These findings suggest that depressed LGBTQ+ students are not \nmanifesting suicide-related symptom clusters at higher rates than are depressed students \nwho identify as heterosexual and cisgender.  \nFurther statistical comparisons revealed that there were no significant statistical \ndifferences between depressed queer and non-queer students for any symptom cluster \nexcept for suicide and self-harm ideation. In this sample, queer students reported \nsignificantly higher rates of suicide and self-harm ideation (M=2.15, SD=.790) than did \nnon-queer students (M= 1.84, SD= .816); t(143)=2.26, p = .025. This indicates that queer \nstudents are more suicidal than non-queer students even though they do not report \nsignificantly higher rates of any other depressive symptom cluster, or even higher overall \nseverity of depressive symptoms; t(143)=.739, p = .461. This difference was not uniform \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n20 \n \nacross the queer student sample. A one-way ANOVA yielded significant variation among \ndifferent queer identities within the queer sample, F(4,140) = 2.826, p = .012). Post-hoc \nTukey's HSD tests showed that “other” queer students, who identify as LGBTQ+ but not \nas gay, lesbian, or bisexual (e.g., pansexual, asexual, genderqueer) reported significantly \nhigher rates of suicide and self-harm ideation (M = 2.47, SD = 0.74) than both LGB (M = \n2.07, SD =  1.04) and non-queer participants (M = 1.83, SD = .84) at p > .05. All other \ncomparisons were not significant.  \n \nEven when there are no other differences in depression manifestation, queer \nstudents report significantly higher rates of suicide and self-harm ideation than non-queer \nstudents, especially among “other” queer students who do not identify as gay, lesbian, or \nbisexual.  \nPerceived Social Support \nHypothesis 2, which predicts that depressed queer students would report lower \nrates of perceived social support than non-queer depressed students, was examined by \ntaking a mean score for each of the three subscales on the Perceived Social Support Scale \n(family, friends, and special person) as well as an average across all items to give an \noverall PSS score. In this sample, a series of independent-samples t-tests indicated no \nsignificant difference on levels of overall perceived social support between queer \nstudents (M=4.59, SD=.860) and non-queer students (M=4.46, SD=.1.15); t(143)=.771, p \n= .442. However, queer students reported a significantly higher rate of perceived social \nsupport from friends (M=4.55, SD=.957) than did non-queer students (M=4.15, \nSD=.1.30); t(143)=2.144, p = .034. The two groups did not differ on social support from \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n21 \n \nfamily (t[143]=-1.037, p = .302), or social support from a special person (t[143]=.914, p \n= .362). Although queer students reported significantly higher rates of perceived social \nsupport from friends, there were no differences between the two groups on other \nmeasures of perceived social support. \n In sum, our first two hypotheses were not supported. However, despite no other \nsignificant differences in symptom clusters or overall perceived social support, queer \nstudents demonstrate disparate rates of suicide ideation. Additionally, there were no \nsignificant differences on perceived social support or symptom clusters across ethnic \ngroups or between cisgender men and cisgender women.  \n Due to the lack of initial findings, the mediation analysis between perceived \nsocial support, sexual orientation, and hopelessness and guilt/self-blame was not run.  \nSuicide Ideation Predictors \nTo determine which factors may be predicting suicide and self-harm ideation, a \nstepwise multiple regression was used to test whether suicide-related symptom clusters \nand different forms of perceived social support predicted suicidality scores among queer \nand non-queer students. Hopelessness was entered in Step 1 of the regression, guilt/self-\nblame was included in step 2, followed by overall perceived social support score, family \nPSS score, friends PSS score, and special person PSS score in steps 3, 4, 5, and 6, \nrespectively. For cisgender and heterosexual students, the model was significant (F(6,59) \n= 6.976, p < .000), and accounted for approximately 36% of the variance of suicide and \nself-harm ideation (R2  = .356). Hopelessness significantly predicted suicide and self-\nharm ideation (β = .518, p < .000), and self-blame/guilt approached significance (β = \n.211, p = .063). Perceived social support variables did not significantly predict \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n22 \n \nsuicidality, and were excluded from the model. Similarly for queer students, a significant \nregression equation was also found (F(6,72) = 5.882, p < .000), and accounted for \napproximately 27% of the variance of suicide and self-harm ideation (R2 = .273). \nHopelessness significantly predicted suicide and self-harm ideation among queer students \n(β = .443, p < .000), but self-blame/guilt was not a significant predictor (β = .090, p = \n.452). This suggests that the predictive relationship between guilt/self-blame and \nsuicidality may not apply to queer populations. Regression statistics for queer and non-\nqueer students are reported in Tables 1 and 2.  \n \nTable 1  \nSummary of Stepwise Regression Analysis for Variables predicting Suicide and Self-harm \nIdeation among Non-Queer Students \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n23 \n \nTable 2 \nSummary of Stepwise Regression Analysis for Variables predicting Suicide and Self-harm \nIdeation among Queer Students \n \n \n \nDifferences in individual symptom clusters and levels of perceived social support \ndid not explain the significant difference in suicide and self-harm ideation between queer \nand non-queer college students. To examine whether overall depressive symptom \nseverity predicted suicide and self-harm ideation, a simple linear regression was \nconducted for both queer and non-queer students to predict suicidality based on \ndepression severity. For both groups, depression severity was found to be a significant \npredictor, although it explained approximately 15% more of the variance in suicidality \nscores for non-queer students ((F(1,64)=92.07, p<.000), with an R2 of .584) than for \nqueer students ((F(1,77)=58.02, p<.000, with an R2 of .422). This finding implies that \ndepression severity may be a stronger predictor of suicidality among non-queer students \nthan among queer students.  \nTo test for any potential moderation effects, a hierarchical multiple regression was \nconducted in which suicide and self-harm ideation was regressed on to the interaction \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n24 \n \nbetween depression severity and sexual orientation. Depression severity scores were \ncentered prior to calculating the interaction term, and sexual orientation was dummy \ncoded into three dichotomous categories, each in reference to the heterosexual group: \nhomosexual, bisexual, and “other” queer students. Depression severity was at entered at \nstage one of the regression to control, and the interaction variables between depression \nseverity and each sexual orientation group were entered at stage two. Regression statistics \nare reported in Table 3.  \nThe analysis yielded a significant interaction between depression severity scores \nand both homosexual (β = .119, p = .036) and “other” queer students (β = .208, p < .000) \nin comparison to heterosexual students. This suggests a moderation effect of sexual \norientation on the relationship between depression severity and suicidality. Given the \nsignificance of the two interaction terms, this finding indicated that sexual orientation \nmoderated the predictive relationship such that depression severity is a significantly \nbetter predictor of suicidality rates for non-queer students than for homosexual or “other” \nqueer students.  In other words, the predictive factors found by past suicide research (e.g., \nhopelessness and self-blame/guilt) may be more applicable to non-queer populations, \nimplying that queer suicide ideation may be explained by factors unique to queer \npopulations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n25 \n \nTable 3 \nSummary of Hierarchical Regression Analysis for Variables predicting Suicide and Self-\nharm Ideation \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nThe present study examined differences in the manifestation of suicide-related \ndepressive symptom clusters and perceived social support among queer and non-queer \ncollege students. Although past studies have examined which symptom clusters and risk \nfactors are predictive of suicidal outcomes, including ideation and attempts, there has yet \nto be a study specifically examining whether these findings are generalizable to queer \npopulations, who are at heightened risk for suicide and self-harm. Contrary to our \nhypotheses, queer students did not report higher rates of either hopelessness or guilt/self-\nblame than non-queer students, suggesting that queer students are likely not experiencing \nthese symptoms at disproportionate rates. Queer students also did not report lower rates \nof perceived social support, and even reported significantly higher perceptions of social \nsupport from friends compared to non-queer students. However, this finding may be a \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n26 \n \nbyproduct of our recruitment methods. To reach and recruit enough depressed queer \nparticipants, we targeted LGBTQ+ networks and social media groups on college \ncampuses, and asked willing participants to share the study with their friends and \nclassmates. Specifically targeting students who are connected to existing queer networks \nmay have led to an unrepresentative sample of queer college students. As a result of their \naffiliation with these networks, our participants may have higher rates of perceived social \nsupport from friends than queer students who have no affiliation with such a group. \nThese groups may also be disproportionately comprised of a self-selected student \npopulation who are both more open about their sexual orientation and gender identity and \nwho are more willing to actively engage with queer communities. Students who are less \nopen about or comfortable and who feel lower levels of social support from their peers \nmay therefore be underrepresented in our sample.  \n On other measures of both perceived social support and depressive symptom \nclusters, our queer and non-queer student samples were surprisingly similar Despite these \nsimilarities, queer students still report significantly higher rates of suicide and self-harm \nideation. This implies that there may be something inherent about the queer experience \nthat leads to suicidal thoughts and behavior beyond what can be explained by depression \nand social support.  \n Additionally, there was an incongruence between the predictive capacity of \nsuicide-related symptom clusters between queer and non-queer populations. Although \nhopelessness was a significant predictor of suicidality for both groups, guilt/self-blame \nwas unrelated to suicide ideation scores for queer students. While these results may \nappear surprising, extant literature has focused almost exclusively on heterosexual and \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n27 \n \ncisgender populations, and the majority of studies fail to include demographic questions \non sexual orientation and gender identity. Due to this lack of queer-specific suicide \nresearch, risk factors and predictors that have been found in primarily non-queer suicidal \npopulations are often assumed to generalize to queer populations. This study suggests \nthat these assumptions of similarity may be insufficient to understand the unique \ncircumstances and factors involved in the development of queer suicide ideation.  \n Our analyses also found that depression severity was a significantly stronger \npredictor of suicidal ideation for non-queer students than for queer students. This implies \nthat there may be a weaker relationship between depressive symptoms and suicidality for \nLGBTQ+ individuals. This result raises interesting questions for future research; do queer \nindividuals who do not meet the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder still \ndisproportionately develop suicide and self-harm ideation? In other words, are queer \npeople at heightened risk for suicidal behavior even if they are not depressed? This \nfinding may be consistent with recent literature, with one study finding that although only \n18% of queer youth meet the criteria for a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, 31% \nreported engaging in suicidal behavior (Russell & Fish, 2016).  As a result, if depression \nand suicidal behavior are not as strongly related among queer populations, research needs \nto turn to exploring other predictive factors and possible explanations for why queer \npeople, especially queer youth, are so disproportionately vulnerable to suicidal outcomes.  \nThe present research also suggests that queer people are not all equally vulnerable \nto suicidal ideation. “Other” queer students, who align with queer identities other than \nlesbian, gay, or bisexual (e.g., asexual, pansexual, genderqueer), reported significantly \nhigher rates of suicide and self-harm ideation compared to both heterosexual and \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n28 \n \nhomosexual students. When queer mental health research is conducted, it often only \nexamines trends among gay, lesbian, and bisexual populations. Mental health and suicide \nstatistics and research for transgender, asexual, pansexual, genderqueer, and other queer \nminority groups who fall outside of the LGB community are extremely limited, as these \nindividuals represent a small percentage of the general population and are difficult to \naccess. The present research indicates that these “other” queer groups may be especially \nvulnerable to suicide and self-harm ideation, and are therefore a valuable group to study \nboth from a theoretical and an intervention standpoint.  \n If the standard predictors for suicidal ideation and behaviors are more applicable \nfor cisgender and heterosexual individuals, what factors unique to queer individuals and \nthe queer experience could be driving so many LGBTQ+ youth toward suicide and self-\nharm? One possible explanation is that queer suicidality is linked to chronic stressors \ncaused by anti-queer discrimination and harassment. The Minority Stress Theory posits \nthat stress caused by encountering prejudice on the basis of one’s minority status leads to \nheightened risk for developing mental disorders, including General Anxiety Disorder and \nSubstance Use Disorder (McKirnan & Peterson, 1998; Herek, Gillis & Cogan, 1999). \nEven queer individuals who are not “out,” or who choose to conceal their minority status, \nexperience chronic stressors. Although they may not experience direct discrimination or \nharassment, research has shown that concealing one’s sexual orientation causes \npsychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and isolation from social groups, all \nof which are risk factors for suicide (D’Augelli & Grossman, 2001).  \nQueer youth are also subject to rejection sensitivity, or chronic stress caused by \nthe anxiety and expectations surrounding social rejection based on one’s sexual \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n29 \n \norientation (Pachankis, Goldfried & Ramrattan, 2008).  Furthermore, the minority stress \ntheory explains that individuals may turn to unhealthy or destructive coping methods to \ndeal with stress, including self-harm and substance abuse (Meyer, 2003). Substance abuse \nitself may be a major contributing factor to suicidality among queer youth, and the use of \nillegal substances before the age of 18 is highly correlated with both suicide ideation and \nattempts among queer youth (Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017). Queer youth may be \ndeveloping suicide ideation in reaction to chronic stress, even if they do not develop other \ndepressive symptoms that would qualify them for a diagnosis of Major Depressive \nDisorder. Future research should examine mental health difficulties beyond Major \nDepression that are caused by these chronic stressors, and how these difficulties may be \nleading to suicidal ideation and behavior among queer populations. Understanding the \ndirect links between the stress of prejudice and discrimination and suicide ideation may \nhelp to explain why queer youth experience suicide and self-harm ideation at higher rates \nthan they experience Major Depressive Disorder.  \n Another potential explanation for the heightened rate of suicide ideation and \nbehavior among queer youth may be linked to representation of queer suicide in media. A \nnumber of international studies have found that widely publicized suicide stories \nsometimes find a “copycat” effect, in which a person learns about a suicide through \nmedia depictions, and then emulates the attempt (Stack, 2002). Even reporting the \nspecific method used in a suicide can elevate the risk for copycat effects, with an \nestimated 90% of copycat suicides using the same method as the publicized death (Stack, \n2002). Although there are few statistics examining depictions of queer suicide in media, \nqueer youth are repeatedly exposed to both fictional and non-fictional accounts of queer \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n30 \n \nyoung people ending their own lives. Suicide and mental illness are common tropes in \nmovies about LGBTQ+ individuals, and news stories about queer youth who are bullied \nto the point of suicide are not uncommon (Associated Press, 2015; Musumeci, 2016). \nQueer youth may come to identify with these narratives and start to associate suicide with \nqueerness, leading queer youth to think about and consider suicide, even if they do not \nhave other depressive symptoms. However, more research is needed before any \nconclusions can be drawn.  \nImplications \n The unexpected findings of this study highlight the importance of studying queer \nsuicide as its own entity, with its own set of theories and risk factors. The current focus of \nsuicide research may be insufficient to thoroughly understand queer suicidality and what \nleads to it. Simply assuming that paradigms and predictors from research conducted on \nnon-queer populations generalize to this particularly vulnerable group is likely to slow \nthe development of innovative and groundbreaking research, and may ultimately be \nharmful to queer populations by limiting perspectives on queer mental health. If unique \nrisk factors and predictors can be identified, clinicians may be able to improve treatment \nand intervention for suicidal queer patients. Reframing how we conceptualize risk factors \nand predictors of queer suicide may also help to shape suicide interventions targeting \nLGBTQ+ individuals. If depression is not as closely linked to suicidal ideation as it is for \nnon-queer people, suicidal queer people may be better served by treatments and programs \nthat don’t exclusively focus on alleviating depressive symptomology.  \n \n \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n31 \n \nLimitations \n The present study has several limitations. The sample consisted of Southern \nCalifornia college students who attend institutions where the majority of students are \nliberal, and may be more accepting of LGBTQ+ individuals than the average population \ncollege campuses located elsewhere in the nation (Arom, 2012). Therefore, queer \nstudents at these colleges may have higher rates of perceived social support than students \nelsewhere in the nation. The majority of students at these institutions are also receiving \nfinancial support for their education from their parents, and may feel higher rates of \nfamilial social support than other queer populations (P., 2017). Additionally, our findings \nmay have been limited by survey self presentation bias, wherein subjects feel a desire to \npresent themselves as healthy and socially desirable. This bias may lead to participants \nunder-reporting perceived negative qualities and overstating positive qualities in an \nunconscious effort to present one’s self in a positive light. Therefore, our participants \nmay have under-reported levels of depression and suicide ideation as well as over-\nreported levels of perceived social support. However, despite this possible bias, queer \nstudents are still admitting to more suicide and self-harm ideation than non-queer \nstudents. This suggests that the disparity in suicidality between queer and non-queer \nexists even when students are trying to present themselves in a positive light.  \nFuture Directions \n Future research should explore other predictors beyond hopelessness and \nguilt/self-blame, and potentially examine the influence of other depressive symptoms and \nsymptom clusters on queer suicide ideation. Beyond depression, research should examine \nhow other stressors and mental health difficulties may be influencing queer suicide. \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n32 \n \nQueer individuals experience unique forms of stress from discrimination and prejudice, \nand exploring how the stress of being a sexual or gender minority affects suicide ideation \nis essential to understanding why queer individuals are so vulnerable to suicidal ideation \nand behaviors. Future research should also study how the use of negative methods of \ncoping with these stressors among queer youth, particularly substance abuse, may be \nleading to high rates of suicide ideation even among those who do not meet the criteria \nfor Major Depressive Disorder.  Additionally, seminal studies in the field of suicide \nresearch must be replicated with queer populations to examine how much of our existing \nunderstanding of suicidal behavior and what leads to it generalizes to LGBTQ+ \nindividuals. To further understand the relationship between queer suicidality and \ndepression, studies should focus not only on depressed queer individuals, but should also \nexamine possible differences in suicide ideation among queer populations who do not \nmeet the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. Understanding suicide ideation among \nqueer people who are not depressed may help researchers isolate the specific factors that \nare leading to suicidal thoughts beyond what can be explained by depression.  \nConclusion \n Although the present study failed to support our hypotheses, it elucidates several \nimportant findings. Queer college students report significantly higher rates of suicide and \nself-harm ideation than non-queer students. This effect occurred even though the two \ngroups did not report differences on other measures of depressive symptomatology and \nperceived social support. This finding suggests that the differences in suicidality between \nqueer and non-queer students cannot be explained by differences in social support, or \ndifferences in how queer people experience depressive symptoms. Additionally, certain \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n33 \n \ngroups of queer students appear to be particularly vulnerable to suicidality, although \nfuture research is needed to identify potential explanatory factors for this disparity. \nOverall depressive symptom severity was a significantly stronger predictor of suicide \nideation for non-queer students, implying that the established risk factors and predictors \nof suicide ideation may not generalize to queer populations. This finding also suggests \nthat depression and suicidality may not be as closely related in queer populations as in \nnon-queer populations. Future research should focus on identifying factors beyond \ndepressive symptomology that may be leading to suicide ideation and attempts among \nqueer individuals, including copycat suicide effects and chronic stress due to experiences \nof discrimination. This study shows that our current understanding of suicidality may be \ninsufficient to explain the disproportionately high rates of queer suicide, and future \nresearch on suicidal queer populations is needed to explain and to ultimately combat this \nsuicidal epidemic. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQueer Symptom Clusters and Social Support   \n \n \n \n34 \n \nReferences \n \nAlmeida, J., Johnson, R.

    "abstract": "LGBTQ+ individuals report disproportionately high rates of depression and suicidal behaviors compared to the general populations, particularly among queer youth. Certain depressive symptoms and symptom clusters, namely hopelessness and self-blame, are predictive of suicidal behavior and outcomes. In contrast, perceived social support may act as a buffer against suicide ideation. The disparity in the rate of queer suicidality may be predicted by higher rates of hopelessness and self-blame, as well as lower rates of perceived social support among depressed queer youth in comparison to depressed non-queer youth. The current study will test this hypothesis using a sample of depressed queer and non-queer college students (n=145).\nResults indicate that queer students and non-queer students do not experience significantly different rates of hopelessness, self-blame, or perceived social support. Despite this finding, queer students report significantly higher rates of suicide and self-harm ideation. This suggests that differences in the suicide rate for queer individuals cannot be explained by differences in perceived social support or the manifestation of suicide-related depression symptom clusters. Additionally, depression severity was found to be a weaker predictor of suicide ideation for queer students than for non-queer students. This indicates that suicidality among queer populations may be less connected to experiences of depressive symptoms than it is for cisgender and heterosexual populations. Further research is needed to examine possible suicide predictors and risk factor differences that are unique to queer populations to explain the disparity in suicide rates",
