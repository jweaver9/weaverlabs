Introduction \nWe met friends here, we met soul mates here. We expressed ourselves here, we celebrated \nculture here. We remembered love, do you remember love? \n(Invitation to an event at a night club in Beirut) \nBeirut, the vibrant and cosmopolitan capital of Lebanon, scarred by its brutal history of \nsectarian conflicts and bloody civil war, is commonly viewed as the more tolerant city in the \nMiddle East regarding the situation of LGBTQ1 persons (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, \nTranssexual/Transgender, Queer). But beyond the tourist pictures of a sun drenched Corniche \nand busy night clubs crowded with seemingly carefree youngsters, lies a yet more complex \nand multifaceted reality. \nIt is true that in Lebanon organizations promoting LGBTQ rights exist and operate in \npublic. There are bars and nightclubs more or less commonly known for being gay-friendly, \nand in recent years even doctors and lawyers have spoken out against stigmatizing \nhomosexuality. But it is also true that the LGBTQ communities are under heavy pressure, \nboth legally and socially, and that people with non-normative sexual identities and gender \nexpressions are facing harsh discrimination and even criminalization of their sexualities and \ngender identities (Wael 2014). Being slightly safer than Cairo does not make Beirut a safe \nhaven. It might still be very difficult, and even dangerous, to be out as non-heterosexual in \nLebanon, and LGBTQ individuals are living under a constant risk of facing harassment in the \npublic sphere and by the legal system (Human Rights Watch). \nThis thesis is based on a field study conducted in Beirut in autumn 2014 on female \nsexual and bodily rights focusing on the LGBTQ communities. By interviewing queer and/or \nfeminist activists and analyzing the political LGBTQ organizations in Beirut this thesis aims \nto identify some of the main issues in the struggle for LGBTQ rights, focusing on female \nmembers of the communities, and to analyze them using a queer theoretical and \nmethodological framework. The main LGBTQ organizations in focus are Helem, a broad \norganization working to create awareness about LGBTQ issues; and Meem, a female and \n                                                          \n1\n LGBTQ is an acronym for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual/Transgender and Queer and it is commonly \nused as an umbrella term for non-normative sexual preferences and gender identities and expressions. Non-\nnormative in this context refers to non-heterosexual sexualities and gender expressions that are not confirming to \nthe normative male/female gender dichotomy that divides humanity into either men or women. \n2 \n \ntrans2 separatist organization originating from Helem but now working independent and often \nanonymously. \nTo understand the social stigma related to non-normative sexualities and gender \nidentities that contest the male/female, man/woman dichotomy it is of great importance to \nlook at the norms regulating gender and sexuality in society. In this study queer theory and \nmethodology will be used as a tool to understand and explain why homosexuality is socially \nstigmatized and even criminalized in Lebanon and to analyze how patriarchal structures are \ninterlinked with the heteronormative understanding of gender. Thus this thesis relies on the \ncore assumptions that gender is socially constructed and performed and that transgressing \nnormative boundaries is commonly met wish stigmatization. \nPatriarchal structures and misogyny exists worldwide and Lebanon is not an exception \nto this. Women in Lebanon, as elsewhere, are subjected to structural oppression and \ndiscrimination based on their assigned gender. It will be argued further in this thesis that \nheteronormativity and patriarchy are intertwined with each other and that this puts female \nLGBTQ individuals in a particularly vulnerable position. Subsequently, LGBTQ females are \nnot only facing discrimination based on their non-heteronormative sexuality, they are also (as \nare women in all groups of society) being subjected to gender based discrimination for being \nfemales. One aim of this study is to explore how these patriarchal structures are reflected \nwithin the Lebanese LGBTQ communities. Ultimately, this thesis seeks to explore and expand \nthe concept of conceptual anorexia as an analytical tool to identify institutionalized \noppression. \n \n1.1 Purpose of Study \nThe aim of this research is to analyze activism for female sexual and bodily rights in \nBeirut from an LGBTQ perspective. With inspiration from a queer theoretical framework, this \nthesis is based on the assumption that gender binary and heteronormativity are social \nconstructions which are upholding a patriarchal regime. These are central tenets in the thesis. \nThe main analytical tool employed is the concept of conceptual anorexia which is used to \nanalyze the deficient representation of female narratives in society and women’s limited \naccessibility to spaces. Building on the assumption that patriarchy is penetrating all levels of \n                                                          \n2\n Transgender refers to a gender identity that transitions from what was assigned to a person at birth to another \ngender or to another understanding of gender (Tate 2012, 18). Trans is being used here as an umbrella term for \nvarious trans identities. \n3 \n \nsociety, this thesis argues that sexism and heteronormativity are also reflected within LGBTQ \ncommunities which put LGBTQ females and trans individuals in particularly vulnerable \npositions. A further important approach in this thesis is a critical understanding of Western \nself-proclaimed right to define and interpret concepts connected to LGBTQ and queerness, \nand what impacts that has on Lebanese LGBTQ issues. \nThe empirical data has been collected through interviews with queer and/or feminist \nactivists combined with my own experiences from the field. I want to stress the fact that the \nfindings of this study are not representative for the entire Lebanese LGBTQ communities. \nThey are only representative for the persons participating in this study. The intention of this \nresearch is not to draw a complete picture of the Lebanese LGBTQ communities, nor do I \nthink that this would at all be possible or desirable. The intention is to explore some aspects of \nsexualities in Lebanon; to discuss power structures and resistance against them. \n \n1.2 Research Questions \nThe main research questions that are laying ground for the analysis are: \n1) How can female sexual and bodily rights in Lebanon be understood through the \nconcept of conceptual anorexia? \n2) What key issues are identified by queer activists and how do they address those in \ntheir struggle for female LGBTQ rights? \n \n1.3 Choice of Topic, Justification and Limitations \nThe focus of this study is female sexual and bodily rights viewed within the LGBTQ \ncommunities in Beirut. In line with an overall trend, most of what is written about LGBTQ \ncommunities in Lebanon, as in the Arab world in general, focuses on males, a tendency that \nechoes the general treating of male experiences as representing the universal. Samar Habib \n(2007) confirms that: \nThe study of male homosexuality, at any rate, is a much easier one to achieve… To the contrary, \nstudies on female homosexuality in this region [the Middle East] are relatively unknown, which \nresonates with the neglected history of female sexuality in general. (3) \n4 \n \nThis study focuses on tactics used by a sample of activists to advocate for female sexual \nand bodily rights in Lebanon as well as various limitations of female access to spaces within \nand outside of queer contexts. The field work preluding this study was conducted in Beirut \nand that is also the place of focus for the analysis. Lebanon was chosen on two main grounds. \nFirst of all there is an official LGBTQ scene in Beirut, with organizations working more or \nless in public, something that is not the case in neighboring countries in the region. \nAdditionally, there is an active and present debate about patriarchal structures and sexist \ndiscrimination within the LGBTQ communities in Beirut which is a central theme in this \nthesis. The second reason is simply related to security and accessibility. Because of the danger \nand social taboo regarding non-normative sexualities in the neighboring countries, the \nLGBTQ communities are hidden, prevented from working in public, and hence very hard to \nreach for an outsider (like me). I decided that it would be too difficult and too dangerous (for \nme but even more so for potential participants) to conduct this research elsewhere in the \nregion than in Lebanon, given the limited amount of time and resources I had at hand doing it.  \nThe greatest obstacles that I have faced during this field work have been to find people \nto interview. As far as I see it there are two main reasons for this. Firstly, due to the sensitivity \nof the topic, it can be difficult to find individuals who are willing to talk to a stranger about \nissues concerning LGBTQ rights, especially female such. It was very difficult for me to even \nget in touch with the female and trans separatist organization, Meem, and when talking to a \nformer activist of Meem she told me that she could not talk about the organization to an \noutsider. The second reason is that during the specific time that I conducted this field work, \nNasawiya\n3\n – one of the main organizations of interest after Meem – was undergoing \nfundamental changes in their organization and as a consequence many of the activists was \nsimply too busy to have time for an interview. These are, of course, factors that a researcher \nhas to deal with; information is not always easy accessible. \nThe interviews were all conducted in English, which is not the native language of either \nthe interviewer or the interviewees. There is hence a possibility of language confusions or \nmisunderstandings during the interviews which could be a limitation for the data collection. \n \n                                                          \n3\n Created in 2010, Nasawiya, which means feminism in Arabic, is “a collective of feminists working on gender \njustice in Lebanon.” (Nasawiya). Nasawiya is a flat and broad feminist movement with many issues on the \nagenda. In their advocating for the rights of marginalized groups in society and to end all discrimination, \nLGBTQ has a given place at the agenda among other issues. \n5 \n \n2. Contextual and Academic Background \nIn this chapter a brief background will be presented to put the thesis topic in a context. \nThe first section provides an insight in the queer scene in Lebanon where some general \ncomments on queer life and organizing is functioning followed by a short comment on the \nlegal system and how it is applied on LGBTQ issues. After this contextual background I will \ngo through some previous research relating to the topic starting by criticizing academia for \nbeing male dominated and arguing for the importance to challenge this, followed by an \nexamination of existing queer research in Lebanon and finally a putting this in an activist \nperspective highlighting the intersectionality of Lebanese queer activism. \n \n2.1 The Queer Scene in Lebanon \nShia’, Gay and Proud of it! \nThe queer scene in Beirut is vivid, varied and dynamic and it is often received by the \nsurrounding society with much contradiction. An informant stated without hesitation, when \nshe told me how she deals with her lesbian identity in relation to her religious background, \nthat she is “Shia’, gay and proud of it!”4 but when visiting her family she introduced her \ngirlfriend as a close friend since she could not be open about her sexuality in front of them. \nDuring my time in Beirut I have been told stories about harassments, fear of family rejection \nand police brutality and violence. But I was also told (and experienced myself) stories about \nsupporting families and friends, about love, sex and relations and about activism, pride and \nresistance against a hostile surrounding. The LGBTQ communities in Beirut are very complex \nand cut across a range of different spectra of the Lebanese society. \nThe political LGBTQ movements and organizations are all based in certain parts of \nBeirut due to the difficulties to carry out such activism elsewhere in the country. In some \nselected parts of Beirut where the LGBTQ struggle is based, LGBTQ activism can be carried \nout relatively open, as stated by the activists interviewed. Helem, which means “dream” in \nArabic and is also translated by the organization as an acronym for “Lebanese Protection for \nLesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgenders” (Helem), is the first organization of its kind in \nthe Middle East. Helem was preceded by an internet community founded by a couple of \n                                                          \n4\n Shia’ is one of the main Muslim orientations and the Shia’ community constitutes one of the many religious \ngroups in Lebanon. \n6 \n \nfriends in the end of the 1990s called GayLebanon, which later was transformed into a social \nmovement under the name Club FREE (Farah 2012a). Out of this engagement, Helem was \nofficially founded as an organization in September 2004. As explained by an interviewee, \n“Helem was created from a movement […] and it works mainly form two levels; the legal \naspect and social support […] the work is built on experiences from the community” (N5). \nMeem, a women and trans separatist breakaway group from Helem, has chosen invisibility \nand anonymity as a tactic rather than operating in public like Helem. Hence, it is an \norganization that is very difficult to get in touch with for an outsider as myself. One former \nMeem activist told me that to preserve the anonymity of the organization she did not talk \nabout Meem to non-members. While discretion remains the tactic used by Meem, there have \nbeen some public announcements by the organization. The launching of the online magazine \nBekhsoos and the publishing of the book Bareed Mista3jil: True Stories are examples of such \npublic visibility in the name of Meem.\n6\n \nAlthough the Lebanese Psychiatric Society dismissed homosexuality as being a mental \ndisorder in early 2013 (Wael 2014), it remains implicitly illegal, depending on the opinion of \nthe police and judges. Introduced by the French colonial rulers during the mandate period, \n(Lundqvist 2013, 75-76), article 534 states that “’sexual intercourse contrary to nature’ is \npunishable for up to 1 year in prison.” (Abbani). It is not further specified what “sexual \nintercourse contrary to nature” means and cases of conviction under article 534 remains few. \nThus it seems like the purpose of the law is rather to serve as a deterrent for people holding \nnon-conforming sexualities. “On the psychosocial level, homosexuals remain in a constant \nstate of anxiety and fear. At the community level, criminalization of homosexuals leads to the \nisolation and marginalization of a large section of society, denying them the right to exercise \ntheir role in the political, intellectual, cultural, and social life.” (Abbani). \nIn a report from 2013, Human Right Watch reveals that police brutality against LGBTQ \nindividuals is routinely carried out as a kind of informal punishment justified by article 534. \nIn addition to physical beating and torture, humiliation and verbal abuse as well as threatening \nto out LGBTQ individuals or individuals accused to be LGBTQ are not only frequently used, \nit is even routine at police stations. Furthermore, arbitrary arrests of people solely based on \ntheir appearance are common and due to marginalization and criminalization: \n                                                          \n5\n The interviewees will be introduced in section 4.2. \n6\n Bekhsoos is currently inaccessible and inactive and has been since spring/summer 2014 due to unclear reasons. \n7 \n \n[…]members of these groups [are] reluctant to file complaints against police members, which \ncreates an environment in which police can abuse them with impunity. […] Victims sometimes \nchoose not to file complaints due to direct threats from the police and other times due to fear of \nretaliation – police can arbitrarily re-arrest them at any time. (Human Rights Watch 2013, 10) \n \n2.2 Previous Research \n2.2.1. Locating Women in a Men’s World \nAs will be elaborated further in the theory section below, men and male interests and \nexperiences in general are representing the normative, and are thus considered the universal: \n…for all its pretention to being universal, what has been until now considered ‘human’ in our \nWestern philosophy concerns only a small fringe of people: white men, proprietors of the means \nof production, along with the philosophers who theorized their  point of view as the only and \nexclusively possible one. (Wittig 1992, 46) \nThe general tendency of ascribing the masculine as universal results in the existing gap in \nresearch on female sexuality and queer women, and alienates those from representation. By \nnot considering the existence of women and the generally different situation they might have \nin relation to men brings about an insufficient image of societies and social phenomenon \n(Mohanty 1988). Considering the general underrepresentation of a gender perspective in \nqueer research in Lebanon this thesis strives to offer one piece of that missing puzzle. Above \nall I argue that it is difficult, if not impossible, to engage in the discussions of LGBTQ rights \nand existence in Lebanon without considering the female parts of those communities. \nEspecially given the current debate about visibility and representations within the LGBTQ \norganizations in Beirut (which will be elaborated further below) in which internal patriarchal \ndominance is being brought to the agenda. By maintaining a male perspective and allowing it \nto be viewed as universal such debates, which are currently resulting in a restructuring of the \nqueer struggle, are at risk of being overlooked. \n Adrienne Rich (2003) among other argues that the academic gap of female \nrepresentation, particularly regarding sexualities, is a patriarchal strategy to keep women \nsubordinated to men. Her reasoning of a male fear of losing access to female sexuality and \ncontrol of women’s bodies is inspiring the understanding of phobia and the way it is being \nused in this thesis for addressing for instance homophobia, femophobia and transphobia. \nI question the more or less psychoanalytic perspective […] that the male need to control women \nsexually results from some primal male “fear of women” and of women’s sexual insatiability. It \nseems more probable that men really fear not that they will have women’s sexual appetites \n8 \n \nforced on them or that women want to smother and devour them, but that women could be \nindifferent to them altogether, that men could be allowed sexual and emotional—therefore \neconomic—access to women only on women’s terms, otherwise being left on the periphery of \nthe matrix. (Rich 2003, 22) \nThus, phobia in this context is not translated to fear of the subject to whom the phobia is being \ndirected, but it is understood as the fear of the privileged group to lose privileges to \nmarginalized groups if power structures are being challenged. \nDissertations about historical, social and cultural events that claim to represent a \nuniversal view of the topic covered are commonly examining a more or less exclusively male \nperspective. Subsequently, books like A History of the Modern Middle East (Cleveland 2013) \nand The Modern Middle East: A History (Gelvin 2011), despite the universal claim of the \ntitles, are almost exclusively examining male experiences. Contrary to this, historical, social \nand cultural documentations that aim to present either a female perspective or a broader \ngender inclusive perspective tend to point that out already in the titles. Nikki Keddie’s \nexposition of Middle Eastern history in a women’s perspective is accordingly titled Women in \nthe Middle East: Past and Present (2007). Examining women’s lives and situations, and \nanalyzing gender relations, religious influences and women’s movements, Keddie is \npresenting an ambitious historical overview of women’s existence in the Middle East from the \nrise of Islam to contemporary Middle Eastern societies. Additionally she is critically \ndiscussing approaches in the studying of women in the Middle East. She touches on the issue \nof female sexualities, although not providing a deeper analysis on female queerness, but her \nbook constitutes an informative overall historical overview of Middle Eastern women. \nIn her introduction to the anthology Deconstructing Sexuality in the Middle East: \nChallenges and Discourses, Ilkkaracan (2008) provides a gendered examination of sexuality \ndiscourses in the Middle East both viewed in an international and a regional context. She \nargues that “In the Middle East, policies and practices that aim to control sexual autonomy \nand confine sexuality within the framework of marriage, leads to human rights violations of \nwomen, young people and those with non-conforming sexualities.” (9). That said, she also \nhighlights the many internal initiatives to address those issues in the region. According to \nIlkkaracan, it is of great importance to engage in debates about sexuality in the Middle East \nsince “the collective mechanisms aimed at controlling women’s bodies and sexuality continue \nto be one of the most powerful tools of patriarchal management of women’s sexuality, and a \nroot cause of gender inequality in the region.” (3). \n9 \n \nSamar Habib (2007) provides a deeper analysis of female homosexuality in the Middle \nEast, although almost exclusively the Muslim, Arab Middle East, particularly focusing on \nLebanon and Egypt. Her discussion is centered on representations, and the lack of such, in \nArab societies, historical narratives and popular culture. Habib is analyzing literature and \nmovies that in some ways touches upon the issues of, in Rich’s (2003) terminology, lesbian \nexistence which refers to female same-sex eroticism, and lesbian continuum that is women’s \nrelations to one another, whether sexually or platonic, in terms of friendship, family ties, \nsentiments of solidarity and shared experiences of discrimination. She is concluding that there \nis an overall lack of female sexuality represented in Arab popular culture particularly \nregarding female homosexuality, something she refers to as conceptual anorexia, a term that \nwill be elaborated and frequently used as an analytic tool in this thesis. \n \n2.2.2 Queer Lebanon \nThe existing research on homosexuality and/or LGBTQ issues in the Arab world at \nlarge is generally focusing of the experiences of gay men. This also applies in the case of \nLebanon. Examining homosexuality and masculinities from an islamological perspective, \nErica Li Lundqvist’s book Gayted Communities: Marginalized Sexualities in Lebanon (2013), \nprovides an insight in the lives and thoughts of eight young, Lebanese, men that identifies as \nhomosexual or bisexual and that, in different ways, engage in the gay communities of Beirut. \nFocusing on masculinities, sexuality and identity, the book highlights many obstacles and \ndiscriminations that gay men face because of homophobia in the Lebanese society. Though \nthe title suggest that this book is about marginalized sexualities in general it is solely focusing \non male (homo)sexualities and masculinity constructions. The same is true for the \nethnography Queer Beirut, written by Sofian Merabet in 2014. By strolling the streets of \nBeirut and socializing with gay men, Merabet is exploring queer spaces in the city and \nobserving how gay men are negotiating their non-conforming sexualities in a heteronormative \nsociety. Despite the usage of the generally inclusive term queer in the title, this book is only \nfocusing on queer men and male homosexuality. Merabet is making some attempt to \nproblematize the marginalization of queer women and trans persons within the broad LGBTQ \ncommunity but he fails to give it a deeper analysis and overall he is not giving it much \nattention in his study. \n10 \n \nThese two books, Gayted Communities and Queer Beirut, both point out difficulties and \neveryday encounters in living as a gay man in Beirut, as well as how power structures are \nnegotiated with. In this study I have turned focus to LGBTQ females and female sexualities in \nLebanon. As the analysis will show, although there are some shared experiences of \ndiscrimination, the general situation for queer women is to some extent different. Generally \nhigher social control of women, in interaction with taboo surrounding female sexuality, \nexcludes women from certain contexts and limits them in other. But, as will be elaborated, \nthis taboo might also potentially offer somewhat sexual freedom, although restricted. Due to \nthe stigmatization of female sexuality women’s gender performances and heterosexual \nconfirmations are not under as close scrutiny as men’s and their required masculinity. On the \nother hand queer women and trans individuals are exposed to gender based oppression, even \nwithin LGBTQ contexts, which positions them in a different situation than their male \ncounterparts. Thus this thesis aims to add a gendered perspective to existing research. \nThe social expectation of men to manifest masculinity and, but often through, \nheterosexuality is further discussed by Seidman (2012) in his essay “The Politics of \nCosmopolitan Beirut: From the Stranger to the Other.” Though the essay is dealing with the \nbroader issue of the politics of othering in the context of the Beiruti neighborhood Hamra, one \ncentral theme is regarding gender and sexualities. By applying a gender perspective to the \naccessibility of the streets of Hamra, Seidman argues that the pressure on men to perform \nmasculinity is related to the male control over women’s bodies and sexualities. Failed \nmasculinity means the loss of power and a great risk of being ridiculed and even \ndiscriminated. This Seidman puts in relation to the honor related to women’s bodies and the \ngendered harassment that women are exposed to by men when moving in the public sphere. \nThe anthology Bareed Mista3jil: True Stories\n7\n, which was published by Meem in 2009, \nis as varied as it is ambitious, and in my opinion, it is an important voice in narrating the past \nand present of LGBTQ existence in Lebanon. Based on interviews with over 150 “lesbian, \nbisexual, queer and questioning women and transgendered persons” (2) which are presented \nin 41 stories about all-covering topics such as; family, coming out, discrimination, hate-\ncrimes, religion, self-identity, etcetera; “(t)his book is primarily targeting the Lebanese \n                                                          \n7\n This is an Arabic name written with Latin letters and it is a common phenomenon to use numbers when \ntranscribing Arabic letters that does not exist in the Latin alphabet. The authors comment on the name in the \nintroduction of the book as follows: “’Barred Mista3jil’ has a very close meaning to ‘Express Mail,’ but a better \ntranslation would be ‘Mail in a Hurry.’ It reflects both the urgency of getting these stories across and also the \nprivate nature of the stories – like letters written, sealed and sent out to the world.” (10). \n11 \n \nheterosexual and homophobic societies” according to the editors, and it also intends to “be of \nvalue to girls and young women, in schools and universities, who are staring to question their \nsexuality, or whose sisters seem to be undergoing this process of questioning” (7). \nFurthermore it also “seeks to question and challenge the common misunderstanding that the \nonly alternative to heterosexuality is homosexuality. We tend to label people as either straight \n(heterosexual) or gay (homosexual).” (2). The varied stories in Bareed Mista3jil provide a \ngood insight into many issues related to the everyday lives of female homosexuals, queers, \nand transgendered people in Lebanon, the hardships, discriminations and hate crimes, as well \nas romances, activism, and joy. It is not an academic research but rather an activist attempt to \ngive voice to marginalized groups in a heteronormative surrounding. \n \n2.2.3 Queer Activism and Intersectionality \nThough much existing research about queerness and LGBTQ issues in Lebanon is \nfocusing on identity constructions and the concept of being closeted or being out, some \nresearch is also touching upon queer activism. In a recently published essay Moussawi (2015) \nplaces Lebanon’s two main LGBTQ organizations in the center of an analysis on queer \nactivism at a global and local level. He argues that though certain common traits could be \nidentified in queer struggle and organizing from a global perspective there are still major local \ndifferences that need to be recognized. While criticizing researchers that equals global with \nWestern he rightly stresses that progress does not equal Westernization. In his analysis of the \ntactics of Helem and Meem as communicated by the organizations themselves he finds that \nthey both simultaneously rely on, seek support and solidarity from as well as criticize and \ndistance themselves from global (and particularly Western) LGBTQ contexts. \nHelem does not publicly challenge LGBTQ categories, though it still resists them in the global \ncontext while strategically employing them locally for its intended goals. Meem, however, \nopenly resists and rejects what it sees as a Western model of sexual identities, primarily by \nrefusing the binary of the closet and outness. (Moussawi 2015, 19) \nIn the early days of Helem, the question of whether or not the organization should be \nopenly LGBTQ was frequently debated. In an email from 2005 which is later published on a \nblog, Shax, an early member of Helem, is elaborating her view of the visibility question \nthrough a gender perspective. She emphasizes that the common social denial of female \nsexuality in general is in fact offering queer women a possibility to act out their queerness in \n12 \n \nsecrecy. This possibility is strictly limited but can nevertheless provide some extent of \nfreedom. \nDespite Helem’s ambition to be inclusive and promote gender equality, the work and \nstructures of the organization has been (and is currently) subjected to criticism. In addition to \nthe gendered debate on visibility it was also reported that female and trans members of the \norganization were excluded and marginalized and that Helem in this sense had failed to be an \ninclusive and safe organization (Shax 2012). In a blog post, one of the founders of Helem is \ncriticizing the approach of the organization stating that: “The truth is the space [of Helem] has \nnever been a safe space for women, bisexuals, or trans people.” (Farah 2012a). As early as \n2005 a women-only mail list was established for the female members of Helem, as an \ninitiative to discuss the situation of women but this this was met with much suspicion from \nthe male members: \nPanic spread among the ranks (why do the women want their own space? What will they do? \nWhat’s going on??), followed by anger (you’re being separatists! You’re discriminating against \nmen!), and then a final reaffirmation of control by insisting that there be one male member of \nHelem present on the women-only list to make sure that the uppity women know their place. \nBig Brother is watching. (Shax 2012) \nTwo years later, in 2007, another attempt to respond to the male dominance and create a \nsafe space for female members was made in the establishing of Helem Girls, a separatist \ngroup “by and for women. And they flocked to it. There was clearly a need out there that this \nsort of space tapped into.” (Shax 2012). Eventually Helem Girls broke off from Helem and \nMeem was established as a clandestine women and trans separatist group (Shax 2012). \nThe tactical invisibility employed by Meem is not without friction. Engaging in that \ndiscussion, Al-Ghafari (2012/2013) is critical of the anonymousness of the protagonists in \nBareed Mista3jil, claiming that it “embodies a new split between the lesbian body and the \nvoice” (15). Responding to such critique, Lynn (2010) a Meem activist, argues that this tactic \nis necessary due to the circumstances that resulted in the creation of Meem in the first place. \nFurthermore, according to the Lynn, the intersectional approach that characterizes Meem \nrequires the focus to be moved from the individual activists to the broader contexts where \nactivism is being carried out. Hence, the anonymity is to be viewed as a consciously chosen \ntactic to avoid the stereotyping act of coming out: \nWhat I want to ask is: Had our visibility at Meem been constructed differently, had we tagged \nour foreheads with the words “lesbian”, “queer” or “transgender” and went on national TV \nshows and discussed our own sexualities and genders, our own struggles, had we publically \n13 \n \nlinked our first and last names to our sexual identities, had we exposed our faces as “leaders of \nthe LGBT movement,” would we have been able to be as effective in our community and \nmovement building as we have been so far? Would coming out, in the most mainstreamed sense \nof the word, have served our movement as much as removing ourselves from “the discourse of \ncoming out” did? (Lynn 2010) \nConsidering the conditions in which Meem was once originated, that is as a reaction against – \nand a solution to – patriarchal structures and sexist discrimination of women and trans \nindividuals within the political LGBTQ environment, it should be stressed that this group was \ncreated to be a safe space for people living in a hostile society in which anonymity was \nconsidered necessary (El-Hage 2012/2013). Hence the question whether to carry out activism \nin public or to keep it underground is very much dependent on the objectives of the activism \nbut also on the character of the organization. \nAs will be shown throughout this thesis Lebanese LGBTQ activism is varied and often \nintersectional. This is rightly emphasized in Naber and Zaatari’s (2013) study “Reframing the \nWar on Terror” in which they analyze feminist and queer activism in the wake of the 2006 \nIsraeli invasion of Lebanon. Through interviews and conversations with queer and feminist \nactivist the authors are placing politics of sexuality and gender within a war zone and \nexposing the gendered characteristics of war, a war justified by Western orientalist \nimaginations of saving an oppressed and voiceless Arab people from terrorists and despots. \nContrary to saving Arab queers from an inevitable homophobic society, as perceived by this \ndominant Western discourse, it is rather responsible for creating more obstacles for LGBTQ \nindividuals and queer activism in the Arab world by fueling the perception that homosexuality \nis not Arab but a colonial import from the West (Habib 2007, Amer 2012). As a \ncounterargument Habib (2007) calls for a reclaiming of Arab queer historical heritage. By \nbringing to light and analyzing Medieval Arabic writings about (female) homosexuality and \nfemale homoeroticism she wants to bring to awareness the existence of queerness in pre-\ncolonial Arab history. Although not claiming that Medieval Arab societies were all gay-\nfriendly, she argues that the issue of homophobia in the current Arab world, with its lack of \nknowledge and representation of homosexuality, is a relative modern phenomenon in \ncomparison with medieval writings. \nThe central tenets in Naber and Zaatari’s (2013) study is concerning family \nconstellations (nuclear and heteronormative) and sectarianism. They find that the \ncontributions of LGBTQ activists and organizations in helping victims of the war brought two \nmajor achievements. One is the presence of queer individuals that were in different ways \n14 \n \nhelping people and resisting the war in places where such presence is not usually seen openly \nmight have contributed to awareness about LGBTQ existence and issues and perhaps \nincreasing tolerance. Secondly, the queer activism in the war forced LGBTQ organizations to \nintersect their agendas with other issues such as war, class and sectarianism, and \nsimultaneously to impose queer to these issues. \nThe intersection of class in the queer struggle becomes evident when scrutinizing the \nlegal system in Lebanon and especially, when dealing with LGBTQ issues, article 534 in the \nLebanese penal code. In 2013, Human Rights Watch published the report: “It’s Part of the \nJob: Ill-treatment and Torture of Vulnerable Groups in Lebanese Police Stations”. The \nvulnerable groups referred to in the report are drug users, sex workers and LGBT\n8\n individuals \nall constituting stigmatized groups in Lebanon, thus an easy target for abuse. One main \nconclusion put forward in the report is that “[p]hysical violence was not just used to extract \nconfessions but also as a form of punishment, discipline, and behavioral correction.” (2). \nHowever, the report also finds a clear pattern of class discrimination in the arbitrarily arrests \nof LGBTQ individuals as well as the level of brutality they are subjected to by the police \nduring their detention, in which poor people are more likely both to be arrested and to be \nbeaten and tortured than rich people. Added to the class perspective, Moussawi (2015) points \nout that also LGBTQ individuals from other stigmatized groups such as refugees and migrant \nworker are facing a greater risk of police brutality than privileged individuals (8). \nThis examination of previous research has touched upon several issues related to queer \nactivism, LGBTQ issues and the general marginalization of women and female sexuality in \nsociety, history writings and academia. By intersecting these categories this thesis seeks to \nprovide an insight in the current debates on visibility and access to space that has been going \non for some years within the organized LGBTQ communities in Beirut as well as the issue of \nfemale sexuality from a queer perspective. \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n8\n LGBT is the acronym used in the report. \n15 \n \n3. Theory \nThis chapter will introduce and elaborate the theoretical framework used for analyzing \nthe data of the study. In the first section the term conceptual anorexia will is explained and \nput in context of general representation of homosexuality in Lebanon and a discussion of \nqueer vocabulary. It is a main tool for analyze in this thesis. This will also be discussed in \nrelation to visibility as a political concept which touches upon the debate about visibility \nwithin the LGBTQ organizations in Beirut. Following this queer theory will be discussed as it \nconstitutes the main theoretical framework of this thesis. It will be presented in relation to \nlesbian feminism, which is functioning as an inspiration to the analysis, and the queer \ncriticism of lesbian feminism will be discussed. Finally a postcolonial critique of queer theory \nwill provided. \n \n3.1 Conceptual Anorexia and the Politics of Visibility \nSmall wonder that lesbians are reported to be a more hidden population than male \nhomosexuals \n(Rich 2003, 35) \nAs argued in the section of previous research there is a lack of documentation of queer \nwomen both globally and on a Lebanese level. I argue, in line with many of the theorists used \nin this thesis, that this lack is reflecting a patriarchal reality in which several strategies are \nemployed to keep women subordinated to men and to maintain the heterosexual matrix. \nDenying women historical and cultural representation or deeming female related issues \nuninteresting to explore are examples of such strategies. To address and problematize the \nissue of underrepresentation of female narratives and of female (homo)sexuality in the public \nspace, and popular culture and mind, this thesis is employing Habib’s (2007) term conceptual \nanorexia. According to Habib, there is a “conceptual anorexia surrounding representations of \nthe sexes and sexual orientations” (104). In Arabic popular culture Habib points out that even \nthough homosexuality in general is underrepresented “[t]he number of male homosexual \ncharacters [in Arabic movies], however, far exceeds the number of women, and, in this \nrespect, the scarcity of images representing female homosexuality speak of the general \noppression of women in patriarchal societies.” (119). \n16 \n \nMonique Wittig (1992) argues that social norms are invisible because they are viewed \nas the normal, the natural, the general. The norm-breaking, on the other hand, is visible for \nbeing alien. Hence, according to Wittig “[t]here is only one [gender]: the feminine, the \n‘masculine’ not being a gender. For the masculine is not the masculine but the general.” (60). \nAs a consequence of making the masculine normative, contemporary female existence is \nmarginalized and female historical existence is subsequently ignored. Gay male existence is \nindeed subsumed to homophobic marginalization but, in Wittig’s (1975, 9) words, lesbianism \nis “a theme which cannot even be described as taboo, for it has no real existence in the history \nof literature. Male homosexual literature has a past, it has a present. The lesbians, for their \npart, are silent – just as all women are as women at all levels.” Rich (2003) argues that \nconceptual anorexia is a means with which patriarchal power is enforced on women to ensure \nmale dominance and to subsume women to heterosexuality. “The destruction of records and \nmemorabilia and letters documenting the realities of lesbian existence must be taken very \nseriously as a means of keeping heterosexuality compulsory for women […]” (27). \nHabib’s discussion on conceptual anorexia also applies to the absence of a queer Arabic \nvocabulary. For instance, even though the book Bareed Mista3jil: True Stories was produced \nin Lebanon by Lebanese editors and participants, it was originally written in English and not \nin Arabic. The editors are commenting on this in the introduction where they are discussing \nthe difficulties to write about sexuality - and especially non-conforming sexualities that is the \nsubject of this book - simply because, according to the editors, the Arabic language lacks \nwords to describe certain feelings and identities related to these issues. They state that: \nIt was hard to translate terms like “wetness” or to translate a gender-neutral English text into \nArabic without using gendered terms. Sadly, and for the lack of Arabic expressions, queer \npeople in Lebanon are more likely to frame their identity in English or French because that’s \nwhere these words exists more freely and where we find internet pages and papers written about \nsexuality. So the struggle to define oneself as lesbian and Arab becomes increasingly difficult. \n(Meem 2009, 6-7) \nThe issue of labeling sexual and gender identities and experiences in Arabic is further \naddressed in an essay by Sahar Amer (2012) where she suggests that Arab homosexuals \nshould make use of medieval writings about homosexuality and homoeroticism to claim that \nnon-heterosexual identities have a historic origin in the Arab world. Like the editors, and \nsome of the interviewees, in Bareed Mista3jil, Amer emphasizes the linguistic obstacles in \nexpressing non-confirmative sexual experiences and identities in Arabic. Instead of using \nEnglish and French words, which is often done among Arab LGBTQ persons, Amer calls for \nthe adoption of existing Arabic terms from the medieval literature as well as reclaiming words \n17 \n \nthat are currently used but with a pejorative meaning. Just as the term “queer” was reclaimed \nfrom being an insult into having positive connotations, Arabic words, such as “shādh” \n(literally meaning queer or deviant, from now on the transcription “shazz” will be used)9 \ncould undergo the same transformation. This, she argues, could serve not only to empower \nArab LGBTQ persons but also to refute the common picture in Arab societies that \nhomosexuality is a Western influence (393). Like Amer, Habib (2007) warns for the “dangers \ninherent in the calls for a replication of the Western gay and lesbian rights movement in the \nMiddle East” and suggests that “[w]hat is needed is a new strategy, better suited to different \ncultural and social conditions[…]” (103). However, I want to add a further angle to this \nargument to make it more representative for the complex reality of Arab queerness and \nsuggest that using foreign words to describe non-conforming identities does not necessarily \ntranslate to copying a Western understanding of sexualities, nor does it have to imply self-\ncensorship in Arabic. As the findings will show, queer and questioning individuals in \nLebanon are using both Arabic terms and English/French terms as more or less deliberate \ntactics to linguistic self-empowerment. \nAs a contribution to the understanding of conceptual anorexia I argue that it is not \nlimited to concerning only theoretical and academic fields but that it can also be used to \nmarginalizing women and non-conforming individuals in practice. In this thesis I will \ndemonstrate this by looking at accessibility to public spaces from a gender perspective, a \ndiscussion that is also connected to the debate over visibility, as elaborated above. \nThe public sphere is a male territory and this is evident at every level in Lebanon and as \nclearly notable manifestation of this sexual harassment of women functions as an expression \nof male dominance over the public sphere to which females are constantly in risk for being \nsubjected to if and when they challenge that dominance by entering the public sphere. This \nimpendent threat is limiting women’s access to public spaces, making access to spaces a \ngendered question (Seidman 2012). Excluding women from accessing the public sphere and \nharassing them if they do, is a patriarchal strategy to keep women in their subordinated \nposition as protected objects. Moreover, male heterosexual gaze is reducing women to \nsexualized object to be consumed by men (Al-Ghafari 2012/2013). Male dominance of the \npublic sphere rules at the streets, bars, cafés and public transportation, in short; it penetrates \nall public areas, but even the private is influenced by this due to the common practice of \n                                                          \n9\n When transcribed to the Latin alphabet this Arab word can appear in some alternative variations. I am using \n“shazz”, as is used in Bareed Mista3jil and I am using the same translation as is used in that book. \n18 \n \nhaving men as the head of the family. Attached to this is the honor related to women’s bodies \nand sexualities which the male family member is obligated to protect (Seidman 2012). \nAffected by these structures queer women and activists are negotiating places to be able to \nexpress themselves which is evident in the debate between Helem and Meem over visibility. \nAccording to Meem activist Shax queer women cannot easily revolt against male authority in \npublic or private but they might find a potential relief in the silence surrounding female \nsexuality. \nThis is why women get away with being lesbians, because they are not required to physically \nprove their heterosexuality, it is automatically assumed, but the irony is that you’re actually in \ntrouble if you decide you want to follow through with it. So in that respect, young women get \naway with a lot because anything they do, be it gay or straight, is required to be hidden anyway. \nPushing for lesbian visibility would take away that freedom because it would put them in \nthe spotlight. The more the word ‘lesbian’ is out there, the more I am suspect, the more I am \nvulnerable, and the more my lifestyle is threatened. Sexuality is a very personal thing for many \nwomen because it is simply not allowed to be made public. (Shax quoted by Farah 2012b) \nHence some might argue that the employing of visibility by queer activism is in fact doing \nfemale LGBTQ individuals a disservice. \n To understand why female sexuality, especially non-heteronormative, is such a sensitive \nand tabooed topic I will apply queer theory as a main tool and also draw inspiration from \nlesbian feminism. \n \n3.2 Lesbian Feminism and Queer Theory \nIt is certainly true that without a concept of gender there could be, quite simply, no concept of \nhomo- or heterosexuality. \n(Sedgwick 1990, 31) \nThe academic field of Lesbian and Gay Studies emerged in the 1970s as a consequence \nof the growing public visibility of homosexuality in the Western world. There was, however, \na tension within the gay community where sexual politics cut across gender politics in which, \nquoting Steven Seidman (2013, 241): “Lesbian feminism was a response to the perceived \nsexism of the gay movement and to the heterosexism of feminism. Lesbian feminists aimed to \nseparate lesbianism from male homosexuality and align with the women’s movement.” \n19 \n \nLesbian feminism identifies patriarchy as men’s oppression of women which is \nultimately concealed in the heterosexual matrix in which men own access to women’s bodies, \nreproductivity and sexuality. As an act of resistance women must turn away from men by \nrefusing heterosexuality, thus constructing lesbianism as a political identity with subversive \npotential and even as disengaged from gender binary (Rich 2003, Wittig 1992). \nLesbian existence comprises both the breaking of a taboo and the rejection of a compulsory way \nof life. It is also a direct and indirect attack on male right of access to women. But it is more \nthan these, although we may first begin to perceive it as a form of naysaying to patriarchy, an \nact of resistance. (Rich 2003, 27) \nWhile agreeing that mainstream feminism has failed so far to address heterosexuality as \na coercive and institutionalized expression of patriarchal power queer theory is also criticizing \nlesbian feminism for acknowledging gender binary and thus contribute to reinforcing it. Queer \ntheory rejects the essentialism of gender binary altogether and argues that it is in fact socially \nconstructed. Sedgwick (1990) points out that lesbian theory is commonly relying on a \npolarized understanding of gender and is ascribing lesbianism, not only political status, but \nalso the most pure feminist identity (36-39). Queer theory strives to contest fixed identities \nand broadening the understanding of genders and sexualities. \nAccording to one of the most renowned queer theorists, Judith Butler (1999), there is \nnothing natural attached to sex and gender. Instead of being biologically born into a gender \nidentity we learn how to perform an assigned gender, not because we are that gender or to \neventually become that gender, but we perform it as if we were that gender. Hence, she argues \nthat as much as heterosexuality is a social construction, all sexualities and gender expressions \nare socially constructed and performed. These performances have no original character of \nwhich they are a copy; in fact they are all copies of a myth of the true essence of gender. \nHence, to Wittig’s and Rich’s view of lesbianism as a political resistance, Butler (1999) \nreplies that “lesbian sexuality is no more and no less constructed than other modes of \nsexuality”, (158). Instead Butler argues that by breaking gender binary - by failing to perform \none’s gender as it is expected, whether deliberately or not – the patriarchal construction of \nheterosexuality as compulsory is challenged. Herein lays the danger that the upholders of the \nheteronormative society ascribe non-heterosexual identities, since the normative \nunderstanding of gender also requires heterosexuality. Butler coined the concept gender \n20 \n \ntrouble to describe this phenomenon to which she uses drag performance\n10\n as an explanatory \nexample, but to which the political lesbian subject of Wittig and Rich also contributes.  \nMoreover, queer theory does not search for tolerance or to normalize gay identities in a \nheteronormative context but to topple the entire regime of normativity. Even individual cases \nof acceptance of non-conforming identities, like open minded family members and friends of \nan LGBTQ individual, does not translate to a changing of the heteronormative order as long \nas heterosexuality is institutionalized (Seidman 2001). However, Butler’s concept of gender \ntrouble presumes that if too many people diverge from a norm, or fail to obey to it, status quo \nbecomes threatened. Hence non-conforming people are punished by alienation, \ndiscrimination, harassments and exclusion, which make them visible in the public mind. \nInvisibility could thus be regarded as a privilege, or even reward, to norm-confirming people, \nhowever, as the findings will show, invisibility is also used by some queer women in Lebanon \nas a tactic to avoid the heteronormative gaze by performing heterosexuality. \nWhile to a large extend agreeing with queer theory that sexualities and gender identities \nare socially performed and hence such labels should be contested I nevertheless acknowledge \nthe strategically importance to identify oppressed groups, even with contested labels, to which \nI in this thesis turn to lesbian feminism. However, in this thesis the term “woman” is not \nrestricted to those individuals that were assigned a female gender by birth – ciswomen11 – but \nit can also refer to other gender identities, such as transwomen. Furthermore, all individuals \nthat identify as female or feminine do not necessarily identify as women. This is also how \nsuch terms are used and understood throughout this thesis. \nThat said, it is also important to bring to discussion postcolonial critique of queer \ntheory. As queer theory is criticizing lesbian feminism for being cis-oriented, postcolonial \nfeminism is problematizing the white Western nature of queer theory which is marginalizing \npeople of other colors and cultures. This brings the discussion to a conceptual anorexia within \nWestern mainstream application of queer theory. \n \n                                                          \n10\n There are many definitions of drag but what Judith Butler refers to here is a person that performs the opposite \ngender, usually in a flamboyant manner. Drag queen is the term used for a person, usually with a male associated \nbody, that performs femininity, and drag king is usually a person with a female associated body, that performs \nmasculinity. Butler argues that drag queens usually represent a hyper-femininity, thus being more feminine than \n“natural females” and by doing so are contesting the idea of gender binary as natural and normal. \n11\n Cisgender refers to a gender identity that remains the same as what was assigned to a person at birth. The \nnormative nature of a cis identity results in its invisibility since most cis identified persons do not refer to \nthemselves as cis-women or cis-men but simply as women and men (Tate 2012, 18). \n21 \n \n3.3 Postcolonial Critique: Understanding the Racialized Queer \n…the homosexual other is white, the racial other is straight. \n(Puar 2007, 32) \nNotions of Western academic hegemony and self-appointed right to interpret concepts \nsuch as queer, LGBTQ, gay and being out is posing a delicate dilemma on queers and queer \nactivists in the Middle East. Not only is the Western understanding of such concepts highly \nexclusive and problematic even within Western cultures, but perhaps even more so when \nenforced on other cultural contexts, such as Lebanon. Considering this Western academic, \npolitical and philosophic hegemony, I argue that it is necessary to precede an analysis of \nLGBTQ issues in any non-Western society with a discussion of the Western construction of \nqueerness along with its impacts on other cultural and academic contexts. \nJasbir K. Puar (2007) is providing an accurate analysis of the creation and identification \nof the Muslim/Arab\n12\n other by the hegemonic Western discourse. Puar is arguing that the \nWestern creation of this Muslim/Arab other is sexualized through “the Orientalist wet dreams \nof lascivious excesses of pedophilia, sodomy, and perverse sexuality” (14) and that the \nidentification of the terrorist with the Muslim/Arab other is similarly queering the terrorist \nbody and ascribing the Muslim/Arab other as being homophobic yet homoerotic. As also \nemphasized by Naber and Zaatari (2013) Western nationalism has also constructed the \nconcept of the “third world woman” and the “third world queer” that needs to be saved and \nprotected. The savior is personified as “Western civilization” and the protection is directed \nagainst the pictured threat of the allegedly barbaric, sexist and homophobic “third world” \ncultures (Puar 2007, 1-36). \nAccording to Puar (2007), the Western self-image is one of tolerance and liberal values \nof inclusion. This is put against the depicted image of Muslim/Arab societies as being \nbackwards, uncivilized and intolerant, thus inherently and inevitably homophobic and sexist. \nThis image makes a Muslim/Arab identity incompatible with being queer, gay, LGBTQ or \nfeminist, and also to apply a Muslim/Arab understanding and interpretation of such concepts. \nHence, as put by Puar, the common misconception that leads to the question: “Are you \n                                                          \n12\n I am using this expression in line with Puar’s argumentation of the Western generalization of people from the \nMiddle East, which is commonly equalizing Muslim with Arab and vice versa, thus reducing inhabitants of a \nbroad and diverse region into one homogeneous and extremely simplified identity. \n22 \n \nMuslim, or are you gay?” (21) is making non-normative sexualities suitable to an idea of \nnormativity. \nThe Western self-image of being advocates for tolerance towards homosexuality does \nnot, as mentioned, represent an inclusive attitude towards all non-normative identities. These \nsocieties are nevertheless heteronormative, and homosexuality and queerness is only tolerated \nto a very limited extent; it merely includes individuals that do not challenge the normative \norder and thus reproduce heteronormativity as a nationalistic project. Puar (2007) refers to \nsuch a compromising homosexual identification as homonormativity and notes that it \nexcludes a vast majority of queer and LGBTQ individuals and even contributes to \nheterosexualizing homosexuality. \nThe common Euro-American tendency to label Beirut as a gay haven and as such \ndistinct from other Arab cities has created a queer orientalism that is at the same time self-\nindulgent and exotifying and contributes to an imperial project of importing Western queer \nvalues and interpretations to Lebanon. Having studies gay travel reports and agencies that \npromote gay tourism in Beirut Moussawi (2013) argues that the common Western wish to \ncategorize Beirut as gay friendly goes in line with an understanding of progress as a fixed and \nlinear trend towards increasing tolerance to homosexuality as it is perceived in a Western \nterminology. Moreover, quoting a speech from a Helem activist regarding the phenomenon of \ngay tourism in Beirut he emphasizes that the openness and liberty, as frequently reported by \nWestern gay tourists, tends to limited to just those Western tourists and not enjoyed by the \nlocal queer crowd (Moussawi 2015). \nNevertheless, if, as stated by John C. Hawley (2001, 3), “[t]he central tenet of queer \ntheory is a resistance to the normativity which demands the binary proposition, hetero/homo”, \nqueer should not, and perhaps cannot, be normative. Homonormativity is still highly exclusive \nin its nature since it implies the normalization (and perhaps un-queering) of some gay \nidentities, leaving other gays and queers marginalized, and is thus not challenging the \nhierarchical and binary system. Furthermore, according to Hawley, the gay and lesbian \nestablishment is generally Western, white, and bourgeois and is hence not covering a wide \nspectrum of difference in class, ethnicity, culture or cultural context, factors that are indeed \nrepresented by different LGBTQ individuals and communities which is constituting the core \nof postcolonial criticism of queer theory. \n23 \n \nAs noted by Dennis Altman (2001), the homonormative gay identities that are \nconstructed and promoted as universal by the Western self-appointed right to interpretation \nare commonly associated with a (white) Western, middle class, consumerist lifestyle which in \nitself is exclusive to people who cannot afford to – or otherwise do not have the possibility to \nachieve such a lifestyle – or who do not wish to adapt to it. Altman is referring to this \nphenomenon as “internationalization of gay identities” and he adds that “[m]oreover, attempts \nto use Western terminology […] often block us from understanding the different ways in \nwhich people understand their own sexual experiences and feelings.” (24). I identify this as \nthe same kind of conceptual anorexia that women are exposed to by patriarchal structures \nwhere the recognition of the male as universal is depriving women from cultural and \nhistorical representation. In the same fashion the white supremacist tendency of regarding \nWestern ideals as universal is, in this case, depriving Arabs from employing queer theory in \nother contexts than a Euro-American. \nConclusively, the theoretical framework of this thesis is based on a critical queer \nunderstanding of sexualities and gender identities with inspiration from lesbian feminism. \nConceptual anorexia is used as a key analytical tool and the central tenets of the thesis is to \nexplore female sexual and bodily rights by analyzing different activist tactics and accessibility \nto space. That said, as one of the power structures that are subjected to scrutiny, critical \nawareness about the Western gaze will permeate this thesis as an addition to queer theory. \nOne aim of this thesis is to provide an insight to the consequences that Western dominance of \ninterpretation has for the activists participating in the study and to understand their \nconstruction of Arab and Lebanese queer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n4. Methodology \nThis chapter will sketch out the methodological framework in which the underlying \nstudy of this thesis was conducted, and which has been used as an inspiration during the \nprocess of analyzing data. As will be argued, queer researches require a maintaining of a \nqueer thinking throughout the whole research process. The first section of this chapter \nprovides a discussion about how to do queer methodology, followed by a section contributed \nto introduce the research interviewees and how the interviews have been conducted. In the last \nsection of this chapter I am critically scrutinizing my own role as a researcher and my relation \nto the field. \n \n4.1 Queer Methodology \n’Queer research’ can be any form of research positioned within conceptual frameworks that \nhighlight the instability of taken-for-granted meanings and resulted power relations. \n(Browne and Nash 2010, 4) \nAs elaborated in the theory section above, queer is a mindset, a way of understanding \nhumanity, to define and deconstruct norms and power structures. Queer theory is a tool to \nanalyze as well as challenge current existing discourses on gender, sexuality and identity, to \nseek to understand the surrounding world, the interactions and behavior of people with the \nbasic assumption that sex, gender and sexuality are social constructions. Consequently, when \nengaging in queer researching, it is fundamentally important to keep the queer mindset \npresent at all stages during the process of researching, including the methodological section. \nSince queer theory is about questioning norm-confirming identities it is necessary to consider \nhow to translate queer theory into the methods and how to practice queer in the field work and \ndata collection process. \nIn her essay about conducting queer ethnography research, Alison Rooke (2009) argues \nthat doing queer research is not just doing research about queer people but to actually take \nqueer theory into consideration, to keep it in mind and action, both when conducting the study \nand when analyzing and interpreting the data. Similar arguments are discussed by Kath \nBrowne and Catherine J. Nash (2010) in their introduction to an anthology about queer \nresearch methodology. In this introduction they are discussing how to transform queer theory \n25 \n \ninto methodology. Their concerns are much centered on one key question that they pose to \nthemselves as much as to the reader: \nIf, as queer thinking argues, subjects and subjectivities are fluid, unstable and perpetually \nbecoming, how can we gather ‘data’ from those tenuous and fleeting subjects using the standard \nmethods of data collection such as interviews and questionnaires? (1) \nAccording to Browne and Nash, queer should not be defined and put in a box but \n“remain unclear, fluid and multiple”,(7) and they go even further stating that “queer is a term \nthat can and should be redeployed, fucked with and used in resistant and transgressive \nways…” (9). \nThe methodological approach to this study is inspired by grounded theory.\n13\n Grounded \ntheory is a research methodology that was founded as a reaction and critique of already \nexisting research methodologies which, according to the founders, contributed more to \n“confirm existing theory rather than to test or challenge it[…]” (Engward 2013, 37). Thus, it \naims to create theory out of data and as such requires the entering of the field without \npreexisting conclusions about the outcome of the research. This methodological approach is \nsuitable for this study since it focuses on a very sensitive and, hitherto in academia, relatively \nunexplored issue. It is not about proving or falsifying already existing hypotheses but rather to \ngain understanding by analyzing data. \nAlthough this is not an ethnographic research project, it is methodologically useful in \nthis thesis to draw inspiration from the field of ethnography. Ethnography research is centered \non cultural practices and events in people’s everyday life and preferably focuses on a rather \nsmall sample of people or groups. Frances Julia Riemer (2012, 205) clarifies that \n“ethnographers collect data in natural settings. Basic to the fieldwork approach is the belief \nthat what individuals believe, understand, and act upon cannot be detached from their \ncontext.” However, one must always keep in mind that a researcher is also an individual and \nis never a completely neutral observer of things. Riemer continues by stating that \n[…]because seeing is always filtered through our own ideas, capturing the insider’s perspective \nis neither straightforward nor easy. We bring our cultural selves with us wherever we go, and \neven with the best of intentions, an ethnographer can never see life completely through another \nperson’s eyes. In a similar fashion, the ethnographer is never able to completely write him or \nherself out of the ethnography. (205) \n                                                          \n13\n For more information about grounded theory see for example Glaser, Barney G. & Strauss, Anselm L. The \nDiscovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research. Chicago: Aldine, 1967. \n26 \n \nEthnography research, however, not only strives to explore and understand cultural \nphenomena or expressions from the inside perspective, but should also intend to explain it to \nan outside audience. To get an inside perspective of the subject of focus of an ethnography \nresearch, the researcher may practice participant or nonparticipant observation. Participant \nobservation includes spending time in the environment where the research is carried out as \nwell as interacting with the people constituting the social group of interest. Nonparticipant \nobservation, on the other hand, is observing from the outside, not being personally involved \nbut merely serve as an audience (Riemer 2012, 206-07). Both these techniques are sufficient \nin different kinds of studies and both have been used when conducting the field work that lay \nground for this study. \nThe data collection for this thesis has been conducted using qualitative research method. \nEssential for qualitative research is the importance of a theoretical framework as theory is a \nfundamental part of the research at all stages of the process. In qualitative research, according \nto Alan Bryman (2012, 384), “theory is supposed to be an outcome of an investigation rather \nthan something that precedes it.” Qualitative method is suitable for this kind of study that \ndeals with social and cultural phenomena pictured through emotions, personal experiences \nand individual opinions of the people represented in the study. \n \n4.2 Interviews and Interviewees \nThis thesis was preceded by a field work conducted in Beirut from October to \nDecember 2014. During this period data was collected that lay ground for the analysis of this \nthesis. As a major part of the empirical material, five interviews have been conducted, of \nwhich four of the interviewees are activists. Due to confidentiality I will not mention the \ninterviewees by name, neither will I give them fake names, but they will simply be referred to \nwith an arbitrarily chosen letter. Actual names, even fake ones, carry a greater probability of \nthe reader assuming specific attributes concerning the identity of the interviewee. Many \nnames are gendered, related to certain generations and/or associated with certain cultures and \neven religious belonging. To avoid such assumptions as much as possible, and to let the \nempiricism of the interviews speak for itself, this solution was considered most appropriate. \nThe interviewees will be referred to by their preferred pronoun, and, as will be explained, the \nsexual orientation of one of the interviewees will also be revealed. Apart from this, no \npersonal information about the interviewees will be included due to confidentiality as well as \n27 \n \nthe queer methodological approach in which stereotyping assumptions could be contradicting \nthe deconstructionist nature of queer theory. Only information concerning activism and other \nfor the thesis relevant details will be presented. \nI interviewed a total of four activists, K and N whom are LGBTQ activists, L who is a \nqueer and feminist activist and J who is a feminist activist. L, is, among other things, \nadvocating for women’s sexual and bodily rights focusing on the right to abortion, access to \ncontraceptives and sexual education. L was interviewed twice; first at the café run by \nNasawiya, and then a follow-up interview was conducted at a bar in Badaro, a neighborhood \nin Beirut. When distinguishing the interviews with L from one another, an a will imply the \nfirst interview and a b the second. \nJ is a former activist in a feminist university organization and the interview with her was \nconducted in a café that she chose. J is not explicitly an LGBTQ activist but in her feminist \nactivism gender issues cut across issues related to sexuality and hence she has been doing \nsome LGBTQ related work as well as cooperating with feminist LGBTQ organizations. \nTherefor I choose to include her in this research. \nAdditionally I interviewed M, who is not an activist but who contributed by sharing her \nexperiences as a gay woman,\n14\n growing up in southern Lebanon and currently living in Beirut. \nThat interview was centered on awareness about issues concerning sexuality and access to \nlanguage to express and identify oneself. \nI let the interviewees chose locations for the meetings to be sure that the interviews \nwere carried out in a space where everyone felt comfortable. This is always important for a \ngood interview but even more important when dealing with a sensitive topic such as the topic \nfor this study. The interviews were prepared in advance with open-ended questions but the \nquestions were only used as guide lines and the actual interviews were more like \nconversations where new questions and topics came up along the course of the conversations. \nAs Riemer (2012, 208) points out, interviews for this kind of studies are preferably conducted \nmore similar to conversations than strictly organized interviews. If the interviews are \nconducted by talking, discussing and listening to the interviewee, rather than simply asking a \ncertain number of linear questions, the interviewer might gain information or even \n                                                          \n14\n I deliberately chose not to use the word ‘lesbian’ here since the interviewee referred to herself as gay rather \nthan lesbian and specifically stated that, although she used the word lesbian in general, she did not use it to \ndescribe herself. \n28 \n \nunderstanding from an inside perspective. What is being said, and not said, during such a \nconversation have potential to give a deeper understanding of personal experiences than a \nstrictly structured interview will provide. \nTo create confidentiality between researcher and participants of the study, openness \nabout the research and its aims have been maintained and the interviewees are granted the \nright to withdraw - partially or completely - from participating at any point of the process. The \ninterviewees have been informed of this and they are also informed that in case of a \nwithdrawal all information they provided for the study will erased, and any request of \nparticipants not to reveal certain information entrusted to me has been respected. \n \n4.3 Ethical Discussion – Positioning the Researcher \n…there are so many of us Arab women. Let us not be taken – nor accept to be taken – in \nhandfuls. \n(Haddad 2010, 138) \nThe fact I - the researcher - am a Swedish citizen and a Westerner conducting research \nin Lebanon requires a discussion about Western gaze in academia, and its common \nsuppositions about “Arabs” and “Arab women”. \nChandra Talpade Mohanty’s (1988) essay Under Western Eyes is questioning the \nWestern academic discourse on the East.\n15\n She critically identifies how many Western \nscholars picture the East as homogenous and backwards, in need for salvation by the \n“enlightened” West. Mohanty, and many with her, has pointed out the weaknesses in such a \ndiscourse along with the many false conceptions about the so called Third World, and Third \nWorld women, which it relies on. As for the colonialist salvation project, the Lebanese poet \nand writer Joumana Haddad (2010) notes that change should preferably not come from \noutside and “especially not by ‘outsiders’. Change is not ‘importable’ material.” (27). \nIn line with Judith Butler, Mohanty (1988) contests the term woman as defined as a \nhomogeneous group, neglecting differences and power structures among those categorized as \n                                                          \n15\n Note that terms like “the East” and “the West” are very broad and blurred definitions. I use them here in the \nsame manner as Mohanty does. \n29 \n \nwomen. Similarly she warns for the inherited generalizations and power balance of concepts \nsuch as “third world women.” \n[…]the resultant homogenization of class, race, religion and daily material practices of women \nin the third world can create a false sense of the commonality of oppressions, interests and \nstruggles between and amongst women globally. (Mohanty 1988, 77) \nHaddad is, in a similar spirit as Mohanty, critical of many Western scholars’ tendency to \nuse the concept “Arab women” as equivalent to one homogenous group, thus lumping \ntogether a range of different women from different backgrounds, religions, classes, cultures, \nand so on. By doing so, these women are reduced to a single, voiceless subject of study and \ndeprived of their individual experiences. To correct this error, Haddad (2010) wants her \nreader to shift focus from the (mis)concept of the Arab woman to the discourse of the viewing \nWesterner: \nYet before asking: ‘what is an Arab woman?’ we need to ask another question first: how is a \ntypical Arab woman perceived in the eyes of the non-Arab? Isn’t it a perception mainly formed \nin the Western collective consciousness by a multitude of formulas and generalizations, \ngenerated either by a still persisting Orientalist perspective, or by a post -9/11 hostile view \nshaped by resentment, fear and condescension? (27-28) \nWhile aiming at deconstructing such an orientalist approach of the Arab world, many \nfactors are involved in creating an identity and needs to be considered in order to understand a \nsocial and cultural phenomenon. One central assumption of this thesis is that gender and \nsexuality are socially constructions, and keeping that in mind, another ambition is to challenge \na generalizing tendency when dealing with Arab cultures. The core methodological notions in \nthis study are thus based on the understanding of labels such as “Arab”, “woman” or “lesbian” \nto be simplifications and generalizations and such labels will be handled with care and \nawareness. The aim is, after all, the deconstruction of fixed and imperative categorizations \nand to suggest a more open and fluid view of identifications. \nThere is an academic discussion about who can and should engage in queer researching, \nor to be more specific: whether researchers that claim a conforming sexual identity can and \nshould engage in queer theory.\n 16\n Although I will not enter into that discussion here, I argue \nthat self-awareness is of great importance when doing queer research, both in terms of self-\nidentification and in terms of the researchers’ role in the field. Since my sexual identity is not \nnorm-conforming I had a somewhat inside perspective to the field. However, my Swedish \nnationality and Western academic and cultural background made me an outsider in relation to \n                                                          \n16\n See for example: Sarah Cooper, Relating to Queer Theory: Rereading Sexual Self-Definition with Irigaray, \nKristeva, Wittig and Cixous, (Bern: European Academic Publishers, 2000). \n30 \n \nthe Arab, Lebanese society in which the study was conducted and in which I was a foreigner. \nAs discussed by Alison Rooke (2009), the identity of the researcher, how it is viewed by the \nresearcher and how it is perceived by those inhabiting the field, is crucial for what contexts \nthe researcher will be able to access, what information will be revealed and how this \ninformation is interpreted. Moreover, Rooke asserts that when conducting this kind of study it \nis difficult, if not impossible, not to become personally involved to some extent. The personal \nrelationship between researcher and participant should be taken into careful consideration as \nwell as the researchers’ personal engagement in the topic. Getting to know people on a \npersonal level might deepen the understanding of the cultural and social phenomena central to \nthe study, but it is very important to distinguish between what is revealed in trust to a friend \nand what is shared as an interviewee to a researcher. When conducting the field work for this \nresearch there was not really a distinction between my research and my private life since I \nwas in a way both conducting and living my research. It is thus very important to be able to be \nconfident in what I do include in this thesis and what will be left out of respect for my friends. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \n5. Findings and Analysis \nSome core assumptions of this thesis are that LGBTQ individuals are stigmatized in \nheteronormative societies and that female LGBTQ individuals are subjected to gender based \ndiscrimination, as are women at all levels of society. While acknowledging, and emphasizing, \nthe diversity in the group loosely defined as female LGBTQ individuals, this thesis is \nexamining implication of these power structures which put female LGBTQ individuals in a \ndelicate situation. \nAdrianne Rich (2003, 28) writes that: “Lesbians have historically been deprived of a \npolitical existence though ‘inclusion’ as female versions of male homosexuality. To equate \nlesbian existence with male homosexuality because each is stigmatized is to erase female \nreality once again.” Also Shax (2012) highlights that women are generally subjected to \nstigmatization of their sexuality in a different way than men and, although it is equally \nstigmatized to be queer; queer women and queer men are generally facing different kinds of \ndiscrimination. The findings of this study indeed demonstrate that the general situation of gay \nwomen is different from that of gay men. However, this is not limited to gay women but \nfemale LGBTQ individuals in general as well as trans and queer individuals are similarly \nmarginalized. \nThe empirical findings of this study have been divided into three main themes where \nfindings are arranged and analyzed in subchapters. In the first theme, Norm-Breaking \nNarratives, marginalization of non-conforming identities by conceptual anorexia is discussed \nand put in relation to empowering tactics to reclaim cultural space. The second theme, Space \nand Visibility, deals with the gendered politics of accessing spaces, and engages in the \ncomplex discussion about visibility/invisibility as a tool for LGBTQ activism. I will argue \nthat even this is connected to conceptual anorexia. Lastly, the third theme, Internal and \nExternal Power Structures, suggest an intersectional approach to understand the \ncomprehensive dynamics and entanglements of power structures as brought up by the \ninformants. \n \n \n \n32 \n \n5.1 Norm-Breaking Narratives \nThe issue of conceptual anorexia in narratives and representations about queer existence \nin the broad Arab society has many impacts. Lebanon is not an exception to this. As \nmentioned, the Arabic language is lacking non-pejorative terms to express LGBTQ identities, \nfeelings and experiences and the existing vocabulary for non-conforming identities and \nsexualities is associated with negative stereotypes and insults. By applying the understanding \nof how norms function in society I suggest that this is one expression of the normative \ndiscrimination against the norm-breaking; by only allowing the narratives of the normative to \nbe told, other narratives are efficiently neglected or, as with the case of language, degraded. In \nthe following sub-section, findings related to this theme will be presented together with a \ndiscussion on how the dominant narrative is being negotiated by norm-breaking activists and \nhow queer individuals by different means are reclaiming a place in society. \n \n5.1.1 Reclaiming a Queer Language, Culture and Existence \nMar7aba, ana lesbian.\n17\n \n(Meem 2009, 165) \nM, one of my interviewees, recalled that as a child and teenager, she did not have any \nvocabulary to express sexuality at all, particularly not LGBTQ associated such. In fact she did \nnot have any knowledge at all about sexualities, and she did not receive sexual education \nmore than a brief mentioning of (hetero)sexual reproductivity during biology class. She grew \nup in a social context where sexuality in general, and homosexuality in particular, was \ntabooed. Accordingly, as a child and teenager she did not fully understand her feelings for \nother girls and her disinterest in boys. Although she occasionally pretended to have crushes in \nboys in order to fit in she was not really concerned about her sexuality until at the age of \ntwenty, when a friend of hers came out to her as homosexual and thus opened up a new world \nof thoughts and expressions for her. Once M learned about homosexuality and gained access \nto LGBTQ communities, she also began to come to terms with feelings she had experienced \nas a child. \n                                                          \n17\n Translated in Bareed Mista3jil (165) as: “Hello, I am a lesbian.”  \n33 \n \nButler’s (1999) discussion on performativity – that we learn to perform a given gender \naccording to the norms – not only suggests that gender is a social construction without a true \nessence attached to it, but also that normative gender performances are confirming \nheterosexuality. Thus, when M pretended to be attracted to boys she was performing \nheterosexuality to confirm to heteronormativity. Although she was not aware of her \nperformativity by the time, she described it more like mimicry, her later deliberate entry to \nqueer societies could be ascribed as subversive, even though she was cautious about when and \nwhere she was openly gay. During a great part of her daily life she performs \nheteronormativity. \nM’s story is pointing out an importance deficiency of lesbian feminism as elaborated \nabove, namely the ascribing of lesbianism (or female homosexuality, since M refers to herself \nas gay) as an act of resistance to the heterosexual regime. In fact, both Wittig (1992) and Rich \n(2003) are identifying lesbians as some kind of runaways from patriarchy. What they fail to \nconsider is how this is to be regarded when, as in the case of M, a gay identified woman \nperform heterosexuality on a daily basis. Can she still be cheered as a runaway? Queer theory \nappears to be more accurately applicable in this case since it regards all non-conforming \nidentities as holding potential subversion, but with the Western associated tendency of \nequaling pride with openness it too has shortcomings in providing a satisfying analytical tool \nfor explaining M’s situation. The postcolonial criticism of queer theory appears to be very \nclear in this case. I argue that M being a self-identified gay woman who frequently performs \nheterosexuality does not translate to betraying queerness but rather to negotiate within \nexisting social frameworks. \nM states that she never uses Arabic words to express LGBTQ identities and \nexperiences. Instead she mainly uses English expressions for addressing issues concerning sex \nand sexualities, particularly non-conforming sexualities. She does use the word lesbian when \nreferring to other people, but never to identify herself: “I am gay, I use gay for myself. I don’t \ncall myself lesbian, I don’t know why, I just don’t do it.” (M). This has not been a given \nidentification though, since M at first associated gay as being a male only identification which \nthus could not be used to address female homosexuals such as herself: “I thought gay was \nonly for guys.” (M). But she later reclaimed the G in LGBTQ and is now using the term gay \nto address homosexuality in general, regardless of gender, and to define her own sexuality. \nM’s reclaiming of gay could be used to add a different angle to Amer’s call for Arab LGBTQ \ncommunities to use Arab terms to express queerness. Amer is problematizing queer Arab’s \n34 \n \nusage of English and French, arguing that this is constructing queer as alien to Arab culture. \nCiting one of the stories from Bareed Mista3jil, in which the Arabic term shazz is translated \nto deviant, indeed confirms Amer’s argument and the subversive potential in it: \nI love the word ”shazz!” I would most proudly love to be called a “deviant” from a society like \nLebanon (or any other country on the globe for that matter). It is in being deviants that we resist \nall the unfair distribution of power in the world today. So yes, ana shazzeh.\n18\n (Meem 2009, 115) \nHowever, in the case of M, the English term gay was used in an empowering way, \nwhich I argue do not per definition contradict her from identifying as Arabic and as an Arab \ngay woman. Another protagonist in Bareed Mista3jil even include the English term lesbian in \nher Arabic vocabulary as an act of empowering self-identification after rejecting existing \nArabic terms for homosexuality due to their degrading association: \nArabic is our language too, and languages are alive. People give meanings to words, or invent \nnew words altogether, or simply refuse using offensive words. We need to challenge the \ndictionary in our heads. I will start with myself: I am lesbian. (Meem 2009, 36) \nWhat I am suggesting here is not that Amer is wrong in her analysis, on the contrary there are \nobviously empowering as well as subversive potentials in reclaiming an Arab queer \nvocabulary. But likewise there can be significance in using and owning terms like gay and \nlesbian, even though they originate from foreign languages, in this case English. \nL voiced critique of the very concept of LGBTQ for being just another fixed box to fit \ninto which is rather reinforcing the LGBTQ/straight dichotomy than challenging it. According \nto L, queer must be reclaimed, not only in an Arabic cultural context, but also, and perhaps \nmore importantly, in a broader and more inclusive context that is challenging power structures \nand categorizations altogether. This requires the deconstructions of boxes such as straight \nversus gay to reach a society beyond LGBTQ. She manifested her arguments by asking: “So \nwhat? If I can claim to be one of the letters of LGBTQ, what does that mean? It would just put \nme in a box.” Accordingly she argued that “The problem with LGBTQ is LGBTQ itself!” (L \na). In the light of the theory chapter above I find L’s reasoning here to be clearly in favor of \nqueer theory over lesbian feminism since she in this quote rejects identity based activism and \ncalls for a contesting of labels altogether. In L’s word even the concept of LGBTQ \nidentification is too limiting as she questions the purpose of maintaining such categorization \nwithin queer activism. \n                                                          \n18\n Translated in Bareed Mista3jil (115) as: “I am deviant (queer).” \n35 \n \n The “conceptual anorexia surrounding representations of the sexes and sexual \norientations” (Habib 2007, 104) is explaining the lack of knowledge about sex, sexualities and \nthe body as described by M. Habib also states that female sexuality is generally stronger \nsubjected to this conceptual anorexia, which reflects patriarchal gender discrimination. \nAdditionally, Rich (2003) argues that lesbian existence has been consciously erased from \nhistorical narratives by the patriarchal regime in order to keep women subordinated to, and \nsexually dependent on, men. As a parallel to those reasoning, I want to suggest that ridiculing \nor dismissing attempt to bring issues concerning female sexuality or lesbianism to discussion \nalso contribute to the conceptual anorexia. Al-Ghafari (2012/2013, 6) touches upon this issue \nby stating that: “Even after the emergence of Arab feminism, ‘lesbian subjectivity’ is totally \nsilenced on the assumption that sexuality is not a ‘priority’ in a male-oriented world in which \n‘women’ have more vital concerns to fight for than what is seen as ‘bodily rights’, or rights to \n‘pleasure’.” The activists interviewed in Naber and Zaatari’s (2013) study witness of the same \nattitude of being shamed when raising issues of gender equality and sexual rights during a \ntime of war, as if such issues were merely luxury hobbies and not, as they argue, basic for \naddressing war-related problems. \nAccording to women’s right activist J, it is generally difficult to bring issues of \ngendered oppression and sexual oppression at the agenda. Like Al-Ghafari argues, J has \nexperienced dispute regarding the importance of addressing oppression of women and \nLGBTQ individuals based on the argument that there are more important issues to address \nand hence these issues should not be prioritized. In a private conversation with a political \nactivist I was similarly told that “LGBTQ rights is not important, there are so many other \nproblems in this society, I don’t care about gay rights.” (This person was eager to add though, \nwithout being questioned, that “I don’t have any problems with people being gay!”).19 \nJ argues that such counter arguments are in fact a patriarchal strategy to reduce certain \nkinds of oppression which leads to further marginalization of the groups concerned. She \nemphasized that many factors are involved and intertwined; religion and class, gender and \nsects, all need to be included in an analysis of power structures and all expressions of \noppression matter: “Patriarchy exists in every single sect!” (J). L too rejected such attitudes, \narguing, like J, that it is not possible to isolate certain issues or grading them as more or less \nimportant since nothing happens in a vacuum. According to her, her activism for abortion \n                                                          \n19\n Notes from field work 2014. \n36 \n \nrights is connected to the struggle for female bodily rights which is connected to sexual rights \nand LGBTQ rights: “Everything is connected.” Thus, she argued, “we don’t have to limit the \ndiscussion to sexuality, to talk about sexuality” (L a), emphasizing that issues regarding \nsexuality are cutting across many structures and are thus important to address in many \ncontexts, without the discussion being limited or fixed. \n \n5.2 Space and Visibility \n“Space is political statement!” said L during our first interview. The issue of \naccessibility to different contexts and spaces is indeed highly political and it manifests power \nstructures and hierarchies; resulting in undisputed access for dominant groups and leaving \nthose marginalized in the periphery. Access to spaces is also attached to the issue of visibility, \nthat as well being a highly political matter. Who and what can be present, who and what can \nbe visible - and on the expense of whom? The theme of space and visibility will be discussed \nin this section beginning with a description of the clubbing culture and on what conditions one \ncan take part in it, which will lead to a more in-depth analysis of access to spaces. Finally, the \npolitics of space will be connected to that of visibility in a discussion centered on the \ngendered perspective of visibility, and the usage of invisibility as a conscious tactic to create \nsafe spaces. By arguing that the politics of space is indeed attached to conceptual anorexia \nfollowing sections point out the marginalization of women and other non-privileged groups \nby denying them access to certain spaces. \n \n5.2.1 Gay Bars – for Straight People \nGirls with boys. Not boys with boys or girls with girls. \n(Guard at gay friendly night club) \nBeirut has a reputation for being a party town and not without reason. The night life is \nvibrant and varied and the city never really sleeps. There are some clubs and bars that are \n(more or less officially) gay or gay friendly. Although I frequently went out to different bars \nand clubs that were allegedly gay friendly, I only found one bar where gay couple could dance \nintimately and kiss openly without being harassed. In the other places that are supposed to be \ngay friendly, guards circle the dance floors to make sure that no gay couple is too intimate \n37 \n \nwith one another. If a gay couple is caught kissing, the guard will immediately separate them, \non some clubs by telling them to behave (straight) and in other places by quite literally pulling \nthem apart or even throwing them out of the club. Unlike Sofian Merabet’s (2014, 229) \nobservation, that these guards were “separating any male dancing couple whose bodies were \nperceived as being too closely intertwined”, this practice is used to separate any gay couple, \nregardless of gender.\n20\n \nThe initial quote of this section comes from one of those guards when declaring which \ncouple will be corrected and which couple will be left alone. By saying this, the guard is \nobviously somewhat expecting to encounter couples constituting of “boys with boys” and \n“girls with girls”, it is after all a club commonly known to be gay friendly. This did not \nprevent him from routinely making sure that heteronormativity is maintained at the dance \nfloor, while still allowing gay visitors and profiting on being gay friendly – or simply put; \ngays are welcome to spend their money here as long as they act straight. Puar (2007) is \nemploying the term homonormativity to theorize how certain expressions of queerness are \nconditionally accepted in the normative society as long as they conform to it. Though she \ndefines the term in the context of a Western national state, homonormativity could \nnevertheless contribute to an analysis of the power dynamics at those night clubs. There is \nobviously an extent of acceptance towards certain homosexual and/or queer tendencies, but \nthis acceptance it strictly limited and exclusive, and also totally subordinated the arbitrariness \nof the club owners, the guards and potential police raids (Merabet 2014, 227-232). The fact \nthat LGBTQ individuals continuously frequent those places suggests that many either \nconform to the rules or otherwise negotiate the situation by for example trying to avoid the \ngaze of the guards.\n21\n By creating an acceptable gay subject that does not challenge the norms \non which the heterosexual regime is based is, according to Seidman (2001), a strategy to \nincapacitate gayness as threat to heteronormativity, thus depriving it from subversion. \nOn these same clubs, however, straight couples can kiss and be intimate without facing \nany trouble. Many of the heterosexual guests that I spoke to at those clubs said that they \nenjoyed the open atmosphere at gay clubs and therefore frequented them. But all did not share \nthis sentiment. One man once told me, at a gay bar, to be aware of a group of girls dancing \nclose to me, “watch out for them,” he said, “they are lesbians!”22 Even though these bars and \n                                                          \n20\n Notes from field work, 2014. \n21\n Notes from field work 2014. \n22\n Notes from field work, 2014. \n38 \n \nclubs offer a somewhat friendly space for LGBTQ persons, this safety is debatable and should \nnot be taken for granted. A woman working at the entrance to one of the gay friendly night \nclubs explained to me why it is prohibited to take photos at the club by stating that “this is a \ngay club and we do not want to risk outing our customers against their will.”23 \nAnalyzing Beirut’s club culture from a queer perspective is clearly complex as it \ndescribes a multifaceted reality permeated with structures, customs and social codes. Nor is \nthere a clear distinction between gay friendly and homophobic, the situation is rather a \nspectrum than strictly polarized. Indeed, some allegedly gay friendly places are manifesting \nhomophobic tendencies at the dance floor and transphobic discrimination at the entrance. On \nthe other hand, not all the mainstream clubs and bars express homophobia, although this does \nnot necessarily mean that LGBTQ individuals will feel comfortable being open there, as many \nwould argue that they are rather safe than sorry. As will be elaborated in next section, \naccessing spaces and be able to feel comfortable in certain contexts, is bound to privileges and \nis a highly political nature. \n \n5.2.2 Access to Spaces – Gender and Class \nSpace is political statement! \n(L a) \nAs discussed, the alleged gay friendly clubs are equipped with male guards whose main \ntask is to prevent guests from being too homosexually intimate with each other. In addition to, \nin Merabet’s (2014, 229) words, “trying to make sure that general amusement did not spill \nover into some immoral debauchery”, many female costumers were also subjected to sexual \nharassment by these guards. In line with Al-Ghafari’s (2012/2013) discussion of the public \ngaze, in which female bodies are consumed as objects for male heterosexual desire, those \nmale club guards seemed to view all women at the club as potential targets for their sexual \nobjectifications and harassments. As argued by Eduards (2007, 51-54) the female body is \nconstructed as an object in need of male protection, but it is also subjected to punishment if \n(or when) transgressing the patriarchal order. Since the public sphere is a male domain, \nwomen are violating the order only by entering it and are thus punished by sexual harassment, \nwhich is limiting women’s access to the public sphere. Added to the male dominance of the \n                                                          \n23\n Notes from field work, 2014. \n39 \n \npublic space, generally higher social control of female family members, compared to their \nmale counterparts, also poses a higher risk for LGBTQ women of being outed. This limits \nwomen’s movements in general and makes access to safe spaces for LGBTQ women even \nmore complicated (N, K and L). \nSince this attitude is not limited to the streets but is expressed in all public areas, bars \nand clubs included, women’s access to gay hangouts is restricted. No wonder then that in bars \nand clubs – gay and straight places alike – the crowd is usually overwhelmingly male \ndominated, with few exceptions. Furthermore, as K commented during the interview, many \ngay friendly clubs are consciously denying trans individuals from entering. As emphasized by \nall the interviewees in this study, male domination is not only a bar phenomenon but it is \npresent in the queer communities, organizations and scenes in Beirut, limiting the access and \ninfluence of females. If applied, conceptual anorexia could serve to identify the strategic \nawareness with which women are routinely marginalized from various spaces. It also provides \nan angle of a possible explanation to the lack of female representation in historical narratives \nand academic research since their presence is limited and they are thus more difficult to locate \nand understand. \nAs argued, access to spaces is a highly political question. An analysis of this using a \ncritical class perspective suggests that socioeconomic status is an important factor to consider. \nAs discussed by Merabet (2014), Beirut is not a city for pedestrians. Owning and driving a car \ncosts money, and using public transportation is associated with low status, making mobility in \nBeirut a class issue. K stated that attitudes towards non-normative sexualities and gender \nidentities vary throughout all levels of society and are not connected to class belonging or \nsect, but affording to be discrete about a controversial life style though is indeed a matter of \nsocioeconomic conditions. \nAccess to Beirut’s gay nightlife is also a matter of class belonging. Not everyone can \nafford to spend money on the pricy night clubs and, in some communities, clubbing is not \nsocially accepted which adds yet one more dimension of potential exclusion of LGBTQ \nindividuals from accessing certain social contexts (K). However, the LGBTQ communities in \nLebanon are varied and broad and should not be reduced to merely represent the party culture, \neven though for a foreign viewer this is the most visible and easiest accessed part of those \ncommunities. \n \n40 \n \n5.2.3 Visibility through Anonymity? \nVisibility is for privileged middle class gay men! \n(L b) \nThe question of visibility is a highly political one that varies depending on the context. \nAmong the main organizations Helem and Nasawiya have chosen visibility as a tactic and \nthey both operate in public, whereas Meem has chosen invisibility and is mostly carrying out \nactions anonymously. On an individual level, many queers and LGBTQ activists chose not to \nbe open about their identities and activism, or to only be open in certain contexts. Openness is \nin many cases attached with great danger for the individual.\n24\n The concept of visibility, or \nbeing “out”, is a delicate matter for queer identified individuals in Lebanon, be they activists \nor not. LGBTQ persons living in Lebanon need to make an individual assessment on whether, \nand to what extent, they can come out as LGBTQ. However, as argued by Sedgwick (1990), \ncoming out is not a single one-time-only act, but a process that reflects various encounters and \nsituations. \nThe initial quote of this section was stated by L. According to her, the concept of \nvisibility is closely connected to the concept of “being out of the closet”, both strongly \nassociated with Western cultural interpretation of gay identities and queerness, which is in \nturn reinforcing Western homonormativity, as argued by Puar (2007). The question then \nbecomes for whom visibility is important, and for whom the struggle is carried out. To L, \nadopting the stereotyped Western associated visibility is the same as accepting labels and \nboxes instead of fighting them, and thus the answers to such questions could be put harsh but \nsimple: “Visibility is for the outside world – we don’t struggle for them!” (L b).  \nThe conceptual anorexia surrounding female sexuality originates in the general taboo \nconcerning female sexuality. This is indeed a limiting factor for gender equality and it \ncommonly results – as in the case of M – in insufficient or absent sexual education. \nNevertheless, this could also to some extend be used by queer women to negotiate a \nsomewhat increased possibility to express their sexuality although in secrecy, protected by the \ninvisibility of female sexuality. Contrary to men, women are generally not required to \nmanifest heterosexuality because they are not expected to manifest sexuality at all. This is \nalso why women generally enjoy a somewhat broader scope in terms of dress code since it is \n                                                          \n24\n This is true in many societies worldwide does not exclusively apply to Lebanon. \n41 \n \nmore socially accepted for women to “look or behave masculine” than it is for men to “look \nor behave feminine”, according to N, K and L. Generally, women do not to the same extend \nrisk of failing their gender, as men do because, as argued by Shax (2012), the denial of female \nsexuality is nevertheless relying on the assumption that women are heterosexual. Thus when \nqueer women are taking advantage of this imposed stigmatization they are negotiating within \nexisting system, creating a space hidden from the heterosexual gaze. In this context even \ninvisible acts of resistance could be subversive and thus be included in Butler’s (1999) term \ngender trouble. The lesbian feminism, presented here through Wittig (1992) and Rich (2003), \nthat argue that women can resist heteronormativity and patriarchy by “running away” from it \nby not conforming to heterosexuality could perhaps gain from extending their argument to \nalso apply to invisible resistance to heteronormativity. \nThe social control of women’s bodies, as brought up by M and L respectively, is among \nother ways expressed in a generally higher social pressure on women to get married and \nestablish a normative nuclear family. Social pressure to get (heterosexually) married is a \nsource of anxiety for many Lebanese LGBTQ individuals. According to L (a), the honor \nrelated to women’s bodies is reflected in the glorification of motherhood and female \nreproductivity, thus making it harder for women to live unconventionally, which could be \nseen as a counter argument to the claim that queer women can potentially enjoy some extent \nof space in the imposed sexual taboo. In fact, I argue that this does not counter the tactical \nutilization of invisibility but it rather suggest that this tactic works differently in different \ncontexts and depending on the age and sociocultural background of the woman in question. \nSeen in the light of Eduards (2007) theories, the female body is exposed to \nobjectification and sexualization but simultaneously female sexuality is tabooed in its function \nas a yardstick of male honor. In this function, female sexuality is only allowed to be \nreproductive and failed feminine performativity is at risk of being punished. There are many \nsides to this issue though. M, for instance, does not experience any significant pressure from \nher family to get conventionally married and establish a family, something she suggested was \nbecause she has many older siblings which already have families and children, thus she \nbelieves that her unmarried status is less pressing for her parents. \nAs a further angle to the debate about visibility, L argued that invisibility could, and \nshould, be practiced out of solidarity with more marginalized and vulnerable groups in \nsociety. Considering L’s statement, cited above, visibility is attached to privileges that only a \n42 \n \nsmall group of LGBTQ individuals hold. Subsequently L stated that “If my visibility is on \nsomeone else’s expense, why should I do it?” (L b). On the other hand, and to emphasize the \ncomplexity of the matter, it might be argued that if queerness and LGBTQ issues remain \ninvisible, then heteronormativity (and LGBTQ-phobia) will not be challenged. \nRecent years, the Lebanese society has experienced increasing awareness of LGBTQ \nexistence and issues, which has been positive to some extent but has also led to a backfiring in \nform of increasing homophobia. Negative images of homosexuality in particular, but also of \nother LGBTQ identities, contribute to fueling general prejudices, misconceptions and \nLGBTQ-phobia. This has also been reflected in the mainstream media representation which \nhas been more aggressive towards the LGBTQ communities (L a). \nAccording to N, one major challenge for the work of Helem is dealing with media. She \nexplained that even though Helem activists can carry out their work relatively open – and \nHelem has, as mentioned, a public office, official contact details and a web site – dealing with \nmedia is still problematic. The risk of outing people against their will is a constant threat, and \nwhen dealing with mainstream media that risk is even higher. One way to deal with this is to \nhave reliable media channels that are either allies of the movement or operate from within the \ncommunity (N). \nWhile acknowledging the many obstacles and discriminating structures that LGBTQ \nindividuals are facing in Lebanon, M argued on the other hand that recent years the climate \nhas changed to the better. She is experiencing higher tolerance from the mainstream society \nnow compared to a couple of years ago, especially in Beirut, and she believes that it might be \nslightly easier to be young and LGBTQ today in relation to twenty years ago when she grew \nup. It might be too early to give an adequate and satisfying reason to this improvement and \nthis study is definitely lacking empirical data to provide such an answer, but it is perhaps not \ntoo farfetched to suggest that, if M is right, it could be thanks to ambitious activism and \nincreased public awareness about LGBTQ existence. \n \n5.3 Internal and External Power Structures \nLGBTQ communities do not exist in a vacuum but are affected by, and interrelated \nwith, other contexts and levels of society. Thus, as has been frequently argued throughout this \nthesis; patriarchal structures exist also within queer spaces, and even some queer identities are \n43 \n \nadjusted to normativity. This final theme seeks to explore hierarchies within the LGBTQ \ncommunities, by addressing respectively male and cis dominance through expressions of \nfemophobia and transphobia. Lastly, the impact of Western domination in queer politics will \nbe discussed in the light of previous analysis and theories of the issue. \n \n5.3.1 Femophobia and the Glorification of the Masculine \nIf you are organizing a male dominated room, then [male cases] will be visible on the expense \nof other cases \n(K) \nBoth Merabet (2014) and Lundqvist (2013) are bringing up for discussion the \nphenomenon of prejudice among many gay men against effeminate men, drag queens and \ntranssexuals, all of which are ridiculed for supposedly manifesting femininity. Lundquist \n(2013, 111-121) is describing how drag queens are simultaneously cheered by gay men when \nperforming on stage and then harassed by the same audience while at the dance floor. Merabet \n(2014) is referring to similar tendencies when addressing pejorative attitudes expressed by \nsome gay men towards perceived effeminate men. This Merabet refers to as internal \nhomophobia, coming from within the gay communities, or internalized homophobia, caused \nby absorbing and internalizing pejorative stereotypes about homosexuality from the \nheterosexist society (135-149). He is also using the term homosexual homophobia when \nobserving the lack of internal support from the community when certain gay identities – that \nis gay men perceived as feminine – are discriminated against in public and at gay venues \n(217-226). \nAs has been clarified, the word phobia is being used and understood in this analysis not \nas a fear for the subject to which the phobia is directed, but rather the fear of the privileged to \nlose power and status to the less privileged if hierarchies are being challenged. By scrutinizing \nthe usage of the term phobia, as defined in this thesis, in those phenomena that Lundqvist and \nMerabet are describing here, I suggest that this is not in fact expressions of homophobia but \nrather femophobia. Femophobia is referring to the fear of the male, patriarchal regime to lose \nits power at the expense of gender equality. According to the portrayed narratives, the \nproblem does not seem to be caused by unease with possible homosexuality among the \nindividuals targeted by the internal stigmatization that Lundqvist and Merabet are pointing \n44 \n \nout, but what unites the targeted individuals is perceived manifestations of femininity. Thus \nthis internal stigmatization is reflecting a patriarchal order which is privileging masculinity. \nWittig (1992), Rich (2003) and Butler (1999) are all connecting patriarchy with \nheteronormativity, arguing that the two are interdependent. However, I argue that such \nmanifestations of femophobia as discussed above suggest that also in a homonormative \ncontext, masculinity is still valued higher than femininity in existing patriarchal structures, \nwhich also permeate LGBTQ communities. \nBesides, as also noted by Merabet (2014, 142-149), those gay men participating in \nstigmatization of other queer individuals, as described, are distancing themself from queer \nidentities that are accused to be even more controversial than the own identity. In a \nheteronormative society all LGBTQ identities are constructed as the non-normative, not-\nfitting, Other, thus when individuals, that are indeed already alienated, state “’Ana mesh \nheyk!’ (I’m not like that!)” (146), to in turn defy an even more non-normative group, a queer \nOther is identified within an already existing group of Others. This could also explain the lack \nof internal support, which Merabet (2014, 217-226) labels homosexual homophobia. By \nleaning on Puar’s (2007) reasoning about homonormativity I suggest that these hierarchal \ndivisions among LGBTQ identities could instead be regarded as a form of internalized \nhomonormativity (performed normativity, as Butler might suggest) in an attempt to be \naccepted (or at least less stigmatized) by the heteronormative society. As Seidman (2001) \nargues such attempts to be included in the unity of normativity are counterproductive in their \nreinforcing of a normative regime and their creation of new exclusions. However, many \npeople just want to live their life in peace without being engaged in activism or exposed to \ndiscrimination and hence one should be careful when judging such behavior as unfair. \nWithin a patriarchal society, as elaborated in the theory chapter, femininity in general is \nsubordinate to masculinity, which thus does not solely affect female associated male identities \nbut it is also targeting females in general. According to Shax (2012), gender oppression within \nLGBTQ communities (she is particularly addressing Helem) has for long been an issue of \ndebate. She states that sexist expressions are manifested in different ways ranging from sexist \njokes to verbal and physical harassments and that, as a further marginalization, complaints \nabout it was commonly met with suspicion, ridicule, victim blaming and ignorance. \nMarginalization of women within Lebanese LGBTQ communities is an issue addressed \nand problematized by all the informants of this study. This issue is also the core to the internal \n45 \n \nconflict in Helem that eventually resulted in the establishing of Meem and its disunion from \nHelem. One informant from Helem referred to this as an “unpleasant incident” that tend to \nhappen in such organizations, hence not being specific for Helem adding that “Helem will \nalways try its best to be a safe-zone” and that they are striving at “being more LGBTQ and \nnot just gay.” Although not disagreeing with this standpoint, another informant from the \norganization had a harsher, and perhaps more self-critical attitude towards the subject, \nconfirming that the creation of Meem and its separatist characteristic was and is needed. The \nfact that this conflict is very infected nevertheless witness of its delicate nature originated in \nthe failure of the then main LGBTQ community to satisfyingly recognize and deal with \npatriarchal power structures. \n \n5.3.2 Cis Dominance and Transphobia \nBut the truth is, I’m not male, I’m transgender. I’m very proud to be transgender. Even after \nall my operations, whatever I end up looking like, I will always be a female-to-male \ntranssexual. \n(Meem 2009, 172) \nA further angle of patriarchal structures within the LGBTQ communities and scenes, \nand regarding overall representation in society is that, with its cis orientation, it is also \ndepriving trans individual from inclusion. Just as femophobia is understood here as the fear of \nthe male, patriarchal regime to lose its power, transphobia is referring to the fear of cis \nidentified groups to lose privileges, along with the claim of being natural and normal thus \ninvisible, if gender binary is contested. \nAs discussed, the normative nature of male-man/female-woman gender binary requiring \ngender identities to be cis does not translate to actually being normal and natural, but it is \nunderstood in queer theory as being socially constructed to be perceived as normal and \nnatural. The transgender spectrum of identities is contesting cis-normativity as much as it is \nmarginalized by it. This applies to both a theoretical level and in practice. Theoretically \nbecause much of queer theory’s criticism of lesbian feminism is based in the cis-orientation \nthat is usually characterized by the latter; and practically, transgenderism is related to social \nstigma and marginalization. However, if, as cited by Charlotte Chuck Tate (2012, 20), “there \nis no underlying essence to being female to which a cisgender experience could be \n46 \n \nmeaningfully tied”, then an analysis on queer female marginalization, such as this, should not \nbe tied to ciswomen. \nThe empirical material on transgenderism and transsexuality from the field work of this \nstudy is very scarce and deficient, and the little information at hand is solely concerning \ntranswomen and/or male-to-female transsexuals.\n25\n It is cited in Bareed Mista3jil that: \n“Female-to-male transsexuals like me are even less visible in Lebanon than male-to-female \ntranssexuals.” (Meem 2009, 133). This statement gives a glimpse of the diversity of trans \nidentities as well as it problematizes marginalizing power structures surrounding trans. \nSubsequently, it needs to be emphasized that there are many parts missing in this study to \nprovide an accurate analysis of trans issues in Lebanon. Anyhow, analyzing the lack of \nempirical data suggests that the conceptual anorexia surrounding trans issues in Lebanon is \nefficient and it is obviously very hard for a cis-identified researcher as myself to reach the \ntrans communities, or even note traces of them in the spheres, social and physical, in which I \nmoved in Beirut. \nTrans was touched upon during the interviews with L, K and N respectively, focusing, \nas mentioned, on transwomen. K was emphasizing the social stigma surrounding trans \nidentities, explaining that socially this could result in exclusion from the family, \ndiscrimination at the labor market and housing market and general harassments in the public \nand private sphere. Legally trans individuals face the risk of being arbitrarily arrested by the \npolice and harassed under article 534. According to K there is a general practice of the police \nto place transwomen in the male department of jails and custodies. Considering the social \nstigmatization and hostility of transgenderism in society, there is an obvious risk for \ntranswomen to be subjected to severe abuse in such places. This practice should be regarded \nas a part of an unofficial punishment, as discussed in relation to the legal system. Police \nbrutality against trans individuals is a difficult issue to reach due to the general lack of legal \nsupport of LGBTQ individuals. N argued that as an LGBTQ individual you are more or less \nlawless and that “violence directed at [LGBTQ individuals] is like ‘I can do what I want \nbecause nothing is going to happen to me’” (N), referring to the unlikeliness to be convicted \nfor LGBTQ-phobic hate crimes. This information is further confirmed in the Human Rights \nWatch report presented earlier, in which emphasize is put on the impunity of LGBTQ \n                                                          \n25\n These two definitions are sometimes referred to as equivalent. In respect of the broad spectrum of trans \nidentities I chose to refer to them as separate identities here to avoid generalizations. \n47 \n \noffenders by the legal system and the widely use of unofficial punishments by the police in \nforms of torture, humiliation and ill-treatment commonly targeting LGBTQ individuals. \nThe practice of actively rejecting trans individuals from entering certain gay friendly \nvenues, as commented by K, serves as yet another expression of the internalized \nhomonormativity, as discussed in previous section. Note that I am not at all claiming that \nhomosexuality and transsexuality are equivalent, although I am arguing, on the base of the \nqueer theoretical ground, that they are stigmatized under the same oppressive structures \n(which does not however imply that they are identically stigmatized). The potential \nsubversion of all norm-contesting identities as theorized by Judith Butler (1999) – what she \nrefers to as gender trouble – is also a potential ground for discrimination. In order for a norm \nto exist it has to be defined in relation to what it is not – in relation to the alien Other (Wittig \n1992). Thus, as pointed out by Puar (2007), adapting to homonormativity might provide a \nsomewhat escape from social stigmatization but it can only be done by demonizing someone \nelse, in defining another norm-breaking Other that will be exposed to stigmatization; in this \ncase trans individuals. \nIn relation to the discussion about different strategies to maintain an oppressive system, \nby for instance dismissing and ignoring issues related to oppression, a legal case is \ndemonstrating another such strategy. In 2014 a transwoman was cleared of charges for \nviolating article 534 after being prosecuted for, and admitting to, having had sexual \nrelationships with men. The judge nullified the case, arguing that no crime had been \nconducted, and stating that gender is more than what is written at the legal document; it \nshould also be based on self-identification. The judge based his decision on the fact that the \nprosecuted woman identified herself as a woman and that she further defined her sexual \nrelationships with men to be “classified within the framework of natural relations between \nmen and women” (Legal Agenda 2014), and was thus not being “guilty” of same-sex acts. \nThis legal case could be regarded as a historical landmark for the right of the individual to \ndefine one’s own gender (although it is restricted to one of the two confirming to gender \nbinary; male or female) and of the rights of trans individuals. However, in much of the media \nreporting of the case, locally and internationally alike, this is instead referred to as landmark \nfor gay rights, ignoring the fact that the transwoman in question did not identify as gay.\n 26\n The \n                                                          \n26\n See “Landmark Ruling Rubbishes anti-gay Law in Lebanon,” The Daily Star, March 5, 2014, accessed \nOctober 13, 2014, http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/Mar-05/249261-landmarkruling-\nrubbishes-anti-gay-lawin-lebanon.ashx#axzz3G14168zu, and “Lebanon: Being Gay is not a Crime nor against \n48 \n \njudge did question and criticize the traditional interpretations of article 534 and the unclear \nformulations of the article, but I argue that the potential recognition of transgenderism and \ntranssexuality in this case is lost if referred to as a gay right issue. I suggest this to be yet \nanother contribution to conceptual anorexia in that it efficiently marginalizes, even rejects, the \ndiscriminated group in question. \n \n5.3.3 Western Impact on Queer Lebanon \n…we don’t strive for gay parades, we want something else, something that suits here. \n(L b) \nAs argued, there is a common misconception in the mainstream Arab societies that \nhomosexuality is not inherently Arabic but imported from the West (Amer 2012 and Habib \n2007). This misconception is fueled by the Western self-proclaimed position of defining \nqueer, which goes together with the tendency of equating gay visibility with pride parades and \na certain kind of (gay) lifestyle. The Western narrative about the Muslim/Arab other is \nincompatible with the mainstream Western interpretation of what constitutes a real LGBTQ \nidentity. The main factor in making these two incompatible is the Western narrative that is \nrestricting queer subjects from being other than white, while non-white subjects are \nrecognized but exposed to racialization and cannot be other than straight. Thus it is impossible \nto simply transfer Western homonormative ideals to a Lebanese context. \nThe Western pride movement has frequently used visibility and a kind of “in your face” \nattitude as tactics, which is commonly associated with pride parades and queer galas\n27\n, but in \nthe case of Lebanon, queer activism is carried out under different circumstances and has taken \nother directions. As discussed, the founding of Meem was centered on the need for invisibility \ndue to security reasons and it is practiced as a deliberately chosen tactic. Invisibility might \neven allow women a somewhat increased possibility to live unconventionally. Thus many \nqueer women reject the West-influenced gay visibility (Farah 2012b). Recall for example the \nquote from the informant stating that she is “Shia’, gay and proud of it!” This woman was not \nopen about her gay identity for the majority of the people with which she interacted regularly, \n                                                                                                                                                                                     \nNature,” The Huffington Post, March 4, 2014, accessed October 13, 2014, http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dan-\nlittauer/lebanon-gay-rights_b_4896786.html. \n27\n Examples of this is for instance the popular Queer Nation slogans; “We’re here, we’re queer, get used to it!” \nand “Out of the closets and into the streets!” and the Pride movement. \n49 \n \nincluding her family. Thus she was performing heterosexuality on a daily basis, but \nnevertheless she claimed to be proud of her gay identity. Clearly, in this case, pride does not \nnecessarily require visibility as understood in the dominant Western interpretation of these \nconcepts. \nMoreover, the Western self-proclaimed right of interpretation also has a material aspect \nin terms of funding. Many activists and organizations are reliant of Western money in form of \ndonations. Thus, funding is a delicate and highly political matter that, as argued by L, can be \nsimply put as the choice between money and independence. This is not an easy choice, \nthough, and however you chose, it comes with consequences. As L (b) commented, “money is \npower over agenda” with which she addressed the problem with the many strings that are \nusually attached to receiving funds. L explained how many foreign organizations, especially \nEuropean and North American, provide money with certain conditions which is limiting the \nreceiver’s power over its own agenda. She expressed this by sarcastically imitate the donators \nof these funding saying: “You will get money if you become like us!” adding that in such \ntransactions, cultural differences between the, mainly Western, donators and the Lebanese \nreceiving organizations, are commonly ignored. Still the dilemma remains; what is an \norganization going to do with independence if it does not have money to carry out activism? \nBut what difference does an organization make if it is unable to set an own agenda due to \npolitical involvements of the donors? Financial problems are critical issues for many of the \nLGBTQ organizations (L a). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \n6. Conclusions \nWithout a strong feminist movement that is working on issues of female sexuality, there can be \nno space for anyone to talk about queer female sexuality. \n(Shax, quoted by Farah 2012) \nIt has been argued frequently throughout this thesis that patriarchal tendencies are \nmanifested at every level in society. In the dominant patriarchal discourse, female sexuality is \ncommonly shamed and tabooed as a means to keep women subordinated and maintain the \npatriarchal hierarchies in which female sexuality exists for the purpose of male pleasure and \nreproduction. Hence other expressions of female sexuality than those, have efficiently been \nerased from historical narratives and marginalized in current popular culture. As for the case \nof Lebanon, sexual education is insufficient and for some even absent, especially regarding \nnon-confirmative sexualities and sexual practices. Furthermore, Arabic, the native language of \nmany Lebanese, is lacking sufficient words to express LGBTQ identities and experiences, \ncausing many queer Lebanese to express such things in European languages, mostly English \nand French. This contributes to further alienation of queerness in the Lebanese society and \nfuels the common misconception that LGBTQ is in fact a Western invention. Habib’s (2007) \nterm conceptual anorexia has been employed and elaborated in this thesis to identify \npatriarchal marginalization of females in historical and cultural narratives. The tools for this \nmarginalization that have been identified in this thesis are the erasing of narratives, rejecting \nto address issues of discrimination, the dismissing and/or ridiculing of attempts to bring it up \nfor discussion and the neglecting of certain struggles combined with the appropriation of their \nachievements (as when a trans right victory was reported as a gay rights victory). \nAlthough the taboo surrounding female sexuality is marginalizing women, it can \nsimilarly provide a potential space where queer women can live out their sexuality protected \nby the invisibility of the taboo. Though this is a very restricted freedom, it is employed as a \ntactic for non-conforming women as a possibility to, to some extent, hide from the \nheteronormative gaze. This could indeed be considered subversive. Regarding the language \nissues, attempts to reclaim and own existing Arabic terms, as well as integrating English \nterms into the Arabic vocabulary, can indeed be interpreted as acts of resistance, whether \ncarried out consciously or not. \n51 \n \nAs have been elaborated, issues of male dominance and the ensuing marginalization of \nfemales, have not been thoroughly address nor dealt with by the main LGBTQ communities. \nConsequently, queer women and trans individuals have been organizing separatist \ncommunities, operating mostly underground. Here, invisibility is on one hand deliberately \nchosen as a tactic to ensure security, but on the other hand it has been employed as a \nnecessarily solution to internal discrimination and marginalization, and could thus be said to \nbe enforced due to the circumstances in which these communities were established in the first \nplace. To claim a safe space, women and trans persons frankly had to distance themselves \nfrom males. \nSexual harassment in the public sphere is limiting women’s possibilities to move freely \nand comfortably, thus enforcing many women to be aware of their physical appearance and \nadopting tactics to avoid being exposed to harassment. During the conflict that resulted in \nwomen and trans separatist organizing there were reported cases of sexual harassment \ncommitted by male members of the LGBTQ communities. Such abuses are problematic, not \nonly because they are abuses, but also because they are manifesting patriarchal power within \ncontexts that should be safe for LGBTQ individuals. Lundqvist (2013) and Merabet (2014), \ndescribe expressions of internal stigmatization directed from some gay men towards LGBTQ \nmen perceived as feminine and address them as internal or internalized homophobia. By \ninterpreting the term phobia as a fear of the privileged to lose power at the expense of \nequality, this thesis suggests that such expressions of stigmatization should rather be referred \nto as femophobia. Further it has been argued in the analysis that femophobia can be used to \nunderstand discrimination of individuals that somehow manifest perceived femininity, no \nmatter of assigned gender, in society at large and within LGBTQ communities.  \nHowever, with a queer theoretical understanding of human interactions, phobia is not \ninherited and natural but it is a social construction, something we learn and thus it can be \nunlearnt. This provides a further angle to the discussion about whether visibility should be \nused as a political means in activism for LGBTQ rights. Recall L’s (b) statement that “If my \nvisibility is on someone else’s expense, why should I do it?” She was arguing that by \npromoting visibility some groups or individuals might be harmed and there has indeed been \nan increase of public homophobia as a response to recent increased LGBTQ visibility in \nLebanon. However, invisibility might lead to inaccessibility and it also makes it harder for \npeople to find the communities. In the case of M, for instance, more public visibility and \nawareness would perhaps have made it easier for her to identify her sexuality at an earlier \n52 \n \nstage. The question of whether to – and how to – promote LGBTQ awareness in public is \nclearly a delicate matter. \nDue to stigmatization, many LGBTQ individuals in Lebanon are performing \nheterosexuality on a more or less regular basis. The concepts of gay pride and visibility are \ncommonly interpreted by Western standards in which performing heterosexuality to avoid \nbeing outed as LGBTQ might translate as internalized stigmatization. The findings and \nanalysis of this study are showing a different picture though, where pride and visibility are not \nnecessarily interdependent. As have been argued, it is obviously possible to be “Shia’, gay \nand proud of it!” without being openly gay in every social encounter. Non-conforming \nindividuals are regularly assessing their social surroundings and different tactics are invented \nand employed to negotiate space and identities. Subsequently I want to emphasize that simply \nenforcing Western interpretations of queer to a Lebanese context is neither possible nor \ndesirable. All the informants of this study have respectively called for Arab queer beyond \nWestern impact. \nAs stated by Joumana Haddad (2010, 27) in a critical discussion of the dominant \nWestern view of the Arab world; “Change is not ‘importable’ material.” In harmony with \nHaddad, this thesis does not intend to change the Lebanese society, or advocate for possible \nsolutions to problems brought up and discussed in the analysis. The ambition of this study is \nto offer alternative ways to understand Lebanese LGBTQ communities and internal and \nexternal power structures that affect them. By employing a gender perspective, particularly in \nresponse to the general overweight of male representation in previous research and current \nreports, this study provides a relevant contribution to the field. \nMy overall difficulties in getting in touch with Meem as well as the lack of data from \nthe trans communities could suggest themes for further research. However, in respect for the \nconsciously chosen invisibility employed by Meem, especially considering the fact that an \ninformant associated to Meem explicitly told me that she could not discuss the organization \nwith someone not engaged in it, I argue that it is better to let such discussions come from \nwithin Meem on their conditions. However, there is more to research and analyze about the \ndebate on visibility or invisibility as a tactic for LGBTQ activism in Lebanon. The different \nshapes of conceptual anorexia, as elaborated above, such as erasing narratives and dismissing \nattempts to address discrimination, are opening up for further research about patriarchal \ndisciplining of females as well as non-conforming identities. \n53 \n \nMonique Wittig (1992) argues that there the goal of the feminist struggle is not for \nwomen to become men, or like men, and by that prove that they are as worthy as men claim to \nbe. Rather, the goal lies beyond gender binary, beyond patriarchy. It is not to acknowledge \nmale superiority and become what men are perceived to be; because in the end male identities \nare also socially constructed. The same is applicable for LGBTQ; there is nothing to gain in \nbecoming heteronormative, to be accepted as normal. This would deprive the potential \nsubversion of non-conforming identities and create new groups viewed as Others instead of \ndeconstructing normativity. \n Conclusively, during our second interview, L told me that due to resignation many \nactivists dream about leaving Lebanon, and many do so, especially to Europe. L did not share \nthese sentiments, on the contrary she expressed hopes for the future, saying; “I want to stay \nhere. There is work to be done, I feel needed here.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n54 \n \nReferences  \nInterviews \nJ, December 1, 2014 \nK, October 29, 2014 \nL (a), November 11, 2014 \nL (b), December 14, 2014 \nM, December 15, 2014 \nN, October 29, 2014 \nAll interviews were conducted in Beirut. \n \nBibliography \nAbbani, Hiba. “No to Article 534.” Helem.

    "abstract": "This thesis aims to analyze female sexual and bodily rights in Lebanon from a queer perspective, focusing on issues such as space and visibility and the strategically neglecting of historical existence of female narratives, referred to as conceptual anorexia. The thesis was preceded by a field work conducted in Beirut where observations of the field and interviews with LGBTQ- and/or feminist activists constitute the main empirical data. Queer theory and methodology is permeating the thesis and identifying some core assumptions on which this thesis relies, such as the understanding of gender to be socially constructed and performed. The findings suggest that patriarchal structures and a heteronormative gaze exist even within the LGBTQ communities, which is causing internal marginalization of women and trans individuals. However, the general taboo surrounding female sexuality in Lebanon is indeed limiting women but is similarly being used as providing a somewhat opportunity to escape the heteronormative gaze. Criticizing the Western domination of queer politics, the informants of this study all strive for an Arab interpretation of queer concepts and identities",
