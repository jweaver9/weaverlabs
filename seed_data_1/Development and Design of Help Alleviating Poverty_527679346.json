In addition, the university is mandated to provide extension services to help develop andbuild the underserved and depressed communities in the province. According to Mojares and Baconguis (2015), HEIs play asignificant role in human resource development. Given the array of specialization and expertise provided to the communityby the HEIs, these institutions are considered effective partners in the community’s development process. Moreover, extensionprograms are the interventions of HEIs to the respondents that aim to make a great contribution to members of the commu-nity. Although according to Bibad and Campiseño (2010), demand-driven are among the SUC’s most extension programs, thedemand-driven is usually a community-based project designed to establish and promote the well-being of the beneficiaries,particularly the urban-rural populace.Reid (2020) stated that LGBTQ people worldwide are more vulnerable to poverty, especially in times of pandemics. TheLGBTQ in the Philippines is one of the marginalized sectors in our society that is also highly affected by the pandemic that causeseconomic deprivation. Moreover, LGBT and intersex people are often forgotten (or deliberately left out of) in gender analysesand gender policy discussions. Furthermore, among others, one of the discriminations encountered by LGBT is difficulty findinga job. Based on the article published by Outrage (July 14, 2018) that 30% of LGBT Filipinos report workplace discriminationbecause of their sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression (SOGIE). It is more prevalent for the marginalized LGBTto be discriminated against often leads to difficulty in finding a job. According to Sameluis and Wagberg (2005), freedom toexpress sexual orientation and gender identity is closely connected to economic freedom. Norms concerned with gender andsexuality determine the sexual and intimate aspects of people’s lives and affect access to economic resources and employment.LGBTQ+ people primarily suffer from repression in cultural injustice (being rendered invisible, maligned, harassed, violated,and disparaged in everyday life) and legal injustice (being denied legal rights and equal protection under the law). As a conse-quence of cultural and legal injustice, LGBT people also suffered economic injustice (being denied employment or summarilydismissed from work, being denied family-based social welfare benefits, etc.) Cultural, legal, and economic disadvantages rein-force each other, and thus, the discrimination of LGBT people forms an escalating negative circle of injustice and poverty.Moreover, Badgett, Nezhad, Waaldijk, and Meulen (2014) found out that LGBT people are limited in their freedom in ways thatalso cause economic harm, such as (1) workplace discrimination causes LGBT people not to be employed, which means theirfull productive capacity is not being used; and (2) LGBT students face discrimination in schools by teachers and other students,which hampers their learning and encourages students to drop out, in turn reducing their skills and knowledge related to theworkplace. Also, it was concluded that at this micro-level, the costs to the economy of exclusionary treatment include lost labortime and loss of productivity from LGBT.Moreover, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) issued CHED Memorandum Order 1, series of 2015 institutingGender and Development (GAD) among Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to establish policies and guidelines on genderand development – since the Philippines is being a State Party to the United Nations (UN) Convention on the elimination of allforms of discrimination against women (CEDAW), which is signed on July 15, 1980, and ratified on August 5, 1981, is obligatedto pursue and implement programs, projects and activities that will contribute to the achievement of women’s empowermentand gender equality. Thus, the proponents thought of the extension program that is aligned with the priority of the program ofthe university which is Gender and Development (GAD).The project was dubbed “HAPLAS” which stands for helping alleviate the poverty of LGBTQ through amplifying skills. Theword “haplas” connotes applying and rubbing something into the skin with friction for healing and calming effect. Like thedefinition, this program will give the beneficiaries of hope from healing in poverty.Specifically, this paper aims to: 1. to assess the skills training needs by LGBTQ in Infanta, Quezon; 2. to determine the profileof the projects in terms of extension thrust, numbers of beneficiaries, budget allocation, resources, activities, and implementation;and 3. to develop and design an extension program.132 METHODOLOGY2.1 Research DesignThis study used a quantitative descriptive approach. Mainly, it sought to conduct a needs assessment among LGBTQ membersin Infanta, Quezon, to wit: to determine the training, seminar, technical assistance, and formal and informal education preferredby the participants.2.2 Profile of the RespondentsThe needs assessment was participated by the SILI members. Among 24 respondents which were purposively selected, 91.7%(n=22) were gay and 8.3% (n=2) were bi-sexual. In terms of civil status, there were 24 respondents, 91.7% (n=22) were notmarried and 8.3% (n=2) were married. Also, in terms of educational attainment, 50% (n=12) of the respondents were collegeundergraduates; 33.3% were high school graduates, and 16.7% of respondents were college graduates. Moreover, the respon-dent’s mean age was thirty-three (33) years old; the average number of household members was four (4), and the average numberof children of the respondents was 0.3; however, the average monthly income of the respondents was eight thousand two hundredseventy-three (PHP 8,273.00).2.3 InstrumentThe needs assessment was conducted through a survey questionnaire and was composed of three (3) parts; the first is theassessment of skills training needs of LGBTQ in Infanta, Quezon; the second part is the program (training, seminar, technicalassistance, and formal and informal education) that beneficiaries want to implement in their locality; and lastly, the problem thatbeneficiaries observed in their locality.2.4 Data Gathering ProcedureThe questionnaires were personally distributed by the researcher to the respondents during the annual meeting conducted bySILI. Constant communication was made by the researcher to the respondents using video conferencing and through Facebookchat for the validation and clarification of answers made by the respondents on the questionnaire, this is due to travel restrictionsbrought by the COVID-19 pandemic.2.5 Data AnalysisThe data gathered from the needs assessment were tabulated, tallied, and computed using excel. The results were analyzedaccording to the appropriate statistical measurements. The frequency distribution and the percentile were utilized in determiningthe respondents’ preference in the training, seminar, technical assistance, and formal and informal education.3 RESULTSThe significant findings are presented following the order of specific objectives.3.1 Needs AssessmentThis section determined the needs of beneficiaries as to training, seminar, technical assistance, and formal and informal educationpreferred.3.1.1 Training Preferred by BeneficiariesTable 1 presents the training preferred by the respondents. As indicated in the table, the descriptive result revealed that themajority of the respondents preferred to have training in hair and makeup with 83 percent (n=20).

The table indicates that English andmathematics enhancement has the highest value with 21 percent (n=5), followed by alternative learning, children’s skills training,and art workshop with 17 percent (n=4).3.2 Profile of the HAPLAS ProjectThe program profile of the HAPLAS extension project is presented in Table 5 . The project’s profile includes its extensionthrust or agenda, nature and number of beneficiaries, resources including budget, workforce, facilities used, and activities andstrategies. The extension project HAPALS is under the thrust of gender and development (GAD) and livelihood and skillstraining. The SLSU as Higher Educational Institution (HEI) has set a thrust where activities of the university, like extensionprograms, were anchored from.The beneficiaries of the program are 100 LGBTQ from Infanta, which are members of Samahang Ikatlong Lahi ng Infanta(SILI). SILI is an active organization of LGBTQ in Infanta, Quezon. The members of SILI are mostly living below the povertyline with an average income of Php 8,273.00. According to the Philippines Institute for Development Studies, an individualearning PHP 10,000.00 and below is considered living below the poverty line. Moreover, most of them obtained are collegeundergraduates.Another important aspect of the project is the resources. The project was awarded an amount of Php 117,000.00 from SLSUand Php 50,000.00. Therefore, the amount of total allotted budget for this project is Php 167,000.00. On workforce or humanresources, eight (8) trainers for cosmetology came from JPAL- an association of LGBTQ in Lucban, Quezon, whose members arecommonly prominent in cosmetic science. Three (3) facilitators of the project would come from the College of Administration,Business, Hospitality, and Accountancy (CABHA), and one (1) speaker for financial literacy would come from the BSBA-FMfaculty. Moreover, since the beneficiaries are from Infanta, Quezon, the LGU Infanta provided the venue for every activity.Finally, for the activities and strategies, the project included skills and training development, to wit: haircutting, hair perming,hair coloring, and makeup. In addition, complementary activities such as financial literacy seminars will also be implemented.These activities were implemented in the first phase of the project.3.3 Design of HAPLAS Extension ProgramAfter analyzing the needs assessment, the extension project was designed and developed. The extension project was dubbed\"HAPLAS,\" which stands for helping alleviate the poverty of LGBT through amplifying skills. The word “haplas” connotesapplying and rubbing something into the skin with friction for healing and calming effect. Like the definition, this program willgive the beneficiaries of hope from healing in poverty.16TABLE 5 Program Profile of HAPLAS Extension ProjectProfile DescriptorsExtension Thrust/ Agenda - Gender and Development- Livelihood and Skills and Training DevelopmentBeneficiaries - 100 Student-beneficiaries (SILI members – LGBTQ organization)ResourcesBudget - SLSU Counterpart: PHP 117,000.00- LGU Infanta Counterpart: PHP 50,000.00- Total: PHP 167,000.00Workforce - 8 Trainers for Skills Training- 3 Facilitators- 1 speaker for financial literacyFacilities - Venue and other needed materials (LGU Infanta counterpart)Activities and Strategies - Seminar for financial literacy- Skills and training developmentThe main component of Help Alleviating Poverty of LGBT by Amplifying their Skills (HAPLAS) is a skills training anddevelopment program. Through skills training and development, the LGBT living on the poverty line would be able to uplifttheir economic status by helping them establish the livelihood needed by both the community and beneficiaries. Specifically,these are to actions to be undertaken: 1.) Skills Training and Development program, 2.) financial literacy seminar, and 3.) helpestablish a livelihood.This project is to be facilitated by faculty members from the College of Administration, Business, Hospitality, and Accoun-tancy (CABHA). They will act as the oversight committee representing the CABHA and provide financial literacy seminars.Training and capacity building will be provided by JPAL, a non-profit organization of LGBT in Lucban, Quezon. Moreover,the basic unit that will serve as the intermediary agency to represent the government’s side that supports them in matters ofimplementation of the program will be LGU Infanta.3.3.1 Objectives1. General ObjectivesIn lieu of GAD hominization of gender equality, this project aims to help the LGBT in amplifying the skills that willgive them sustainable livelihood for economic upliftment.2. Specific Objectives(a) 75% of LGBTQ SILI members will be provided training in skills development and empowering them to engage inthe project.(b) 75% of LGBTQ SILI members will be educated on financial literacy.(c) Help the SILI association to establish a livelihood to be managed by SILI and monitored by the project proponents.3. Expected Outcomes and Impacts: Through this effort, it is expected to realize the following:(a) 100 LGBTQ members will improve their level of economic sufficiency.(b) 100 LGBTQ members will be engaged and developed in quality livelihood and/or jobs.(c) Effectively monitor and evaluate the livelihood of selected beneficiaries.174 DISCUSSION4.1 Needs AssesmentThe project was developed and designed because of the result of the needs assessment. Most of the members of SILI as targetbeneficiaries were college undergraduate or high school graduates without a permanent job. Their average age was 33 years old,and the monthly income was around Php 8,000.00 which consider below the poverty line, and commonly their source of incomeis in cosmetology.According to Badgett, Durso, and Scheenbaum (2013), LGBTQ people are vulnerable to conditions of poverty. The samestudy shows that LGBTQ people aged 18-44 are living at or below the poverty line. Therefore, it is indeed necessary for a memberof the LGBTQ to be given free training to amplify their skills since it is their source of income. Moreover, based on the results,the most preferred training by the beneficiary is hair and makeup, with a mean value of 0.83 (n=20). That is why the proponentsconceptualized an extension project that will address the needs of LGBTQ. Moreover, hair and makeup are cosmetology-relatedjobs that are commonly the source of income among the LGBTQ who are unemployed, or when they are employed, it serves astheir part-time work. According to Tan (2001), there are many LGBTQ groups formed in the Philippines, some of them withnational memberships, such as the organizations of hairdressers and parlor workers that help their members amplify their skills.Although other significant results in the needs assessment should also be given attention under seminar, technical assistance,and formal and informal education, the most striking result is the need for training for hair and makeup.4.2 Design and Development of HAPLAS Extension ProjectThe Southern Luzon State University (SLSU) as SUC is mandated to provide extension services to the depressed community.Although according to Bibad and Campiseño (2010), demand-driven are among the SUCs’ most extension programs, thedemand-driven is usually a community-based project designed to establish and promote the well-being of the beneficiaries,particularly the urban-rural populace. To fulfill the mandate of SLSU, the proponent proposed an extension project that willaddress the needs of LGBTQ in Infanta, Quezon. The basis of this project was the result of the needs assessment. The projectwill be divided into three (3) phases such as (1) haircutting, hair perming, and hair coloring training; (2) makeup-relatedtraining; (3) financial literacy seminar. The project will run for four (4) quarters, starting the second quarter of 2021.The following are the details of the implementation plan:Implementation Plan:1. Description(a) Skills training and development program - Design to conduct training and development programs to amplify theskills of LGBT. The skills training program was based on the result of the needs assessment and profiling of theselected beneficiaries.(b) Financial Literacy Seminar - Financial illiteracy and ignorance about money management are one of the majorreasons for recurring poverty. This financial literacy seminar will help beneficiaries be money smart and financiallyliterate for them to make appropriate decisions in managing their finances.(c) Help establish a livelihood - This ensures that selected beneficiaries will be assisted in their livelihood program andmonitor their progress afterward. This is to secure their living by ensuring their source of income.2. Inputs(a) Trainersi. JPAL – for skills training development.ii. Faculty members of the CABHA for training and lecture geared toward financial literacy.3. Monitoring and Evaluation SchemesMonitoring and evaluation schemes will be done to measure the effects of the extension project. Monitoring and evaluationforms prescribed by the Office of Extension Services to know if there is a positive impact of the training programs and18for future development and improvement. A tracer study may follow to know the employability of the beneficiaries orto know their engagement in livelihood activities as they finish the skills training and development. The monitoring andevaluation schemes will be implemented regularly and an impact assessment will be executed in the second semester ofAY 2022-2023(third and fourth quarter of 2022)5 CONCLUSIONThe project was anchored in gender and development and livelihood and skills training extension thrusts, thereby, fulfilling themandate of SLSU and responding to the needs of LGBTQ. This descriptive study revealed the need for training preferred byLGBTQ in Infanta, Quezon. Moreover, it was identified that there are sufficient workforce and appropriate facilities to implementthe project. The project was institutionally funded with the supplemental budget from LGU Infanta.6 RECOMMENDATIONSConsidering the uncovering of the study and its conclusions, it is recommended to replicate the study in another municipalityof Quezon Province to assess the possible implementation of the HAPLAS project. Furthermore, an additional budget couldalso be increased to cover other significant results from the needs assessment. However, evaluation should also be properlyimplemented to determine the success and sustainability of the project.7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis research article was derived from the development, design, and implementation of the HAPLAS Extension Project whichwas funded by Southern Luzon State University (SLSU) and the LGU Infanta.
