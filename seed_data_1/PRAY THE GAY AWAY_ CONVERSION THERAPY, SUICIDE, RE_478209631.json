If you had only had more male in-\u0000uence in your life, you would not be the personthat you are, but it can be \u0000xed. Perhaps you needGod, or perhaps you need to re\u0000ect on what hap-pened in your childhood that made you the waythat you are so that you can move on from it. Yoursexuality is an ailment that you must cure.Thousands of LGBTQ+ youths in the world have heard those words come from the mouths of faithleaders or therapists – or even worse – their own families, in a misguided attempt to change their sex-Economic Inequality Gender Equity Sexual Freedom Social JusticeWe utilize cookies to improve our site and your experience when using it.

These are words commonly heard during a form of gay conversion therapy called ‘talk therapy,’ in which a faith leader or a supposed therapist attempts to ‘cure’ a person of their sexuality by attempt-ing to associate it with some traumatic event or the environment in which the person grew up in. Gayconversion therapy (GCT) has reared its ugly head in various forms over the years, ranging from elec-troshock therapy, aversion therapy, to ‘talk’ therapy, but all have a common denominator: they asso-ciate homosexuality with an illness and teach people that they can ‘pray the gay away.’ In moderntimes, ‘talk’ therapy is the most common technique used, in which a therapist or a faith leader will tellan LGBTQ+ youth that through the power of prayer, their sexuality can be changed. This type of sup-posed therapy is merely a distilled version of the societal pressures that already exist in the life of anLGBTQ+ youth struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. As I will explain through personal expe-rience, these therapists and faith leaders use several techniques that a large portion of LGBTQ+ youthdeal with already: the idea that they can change their sexuality, the power of prayer in removing theirsexuality, and the thought that if a person wants it hard enough, they can remove the ‘stain’ of theirsexuality.In the United States, gay conversion therapy (GCT) has not been banned nationally, although twentystates have issued laws banning therapists from practicing it. While the Supreme Court has refused tohear several cases involving challenges to laws banning GCT, recently the Eleventh Circuit Court ofAppeals found a local law banning the practice as an unconstitutional regulation on the FirstAmendment right of speech. This ruling disappointingly confuses ideas of First Amendment protec-tions with what amounts to psychological torture of our youth. It must be noted that while bans onGCT have been successfully upheld as constitutional in other regions, the laws only ban the practicefor licensed therapists, not for clergy or any other religiously a\u0000liated organization who wish to use thepractice on the youth. This distinction will be discussed later.A THOUGHT, A WISH, AND A PRAYERI knew that if I just asked for forgiveness andbelieved hard enough, I would lose this a\u0000ic-tion. If I truly repent and pray harder, I will losethis pain, this deformity that exists within me. Imust really want it, though; I know I cannot bemyself because being myself means eternaldamnation. I prayed at the pew every Sundayto be relieved of this abomination. I was will-ing to give this part of me away if it meant thatI would no longer have to su\u0000er through thissin. No matter how hard I tried, thesethoughts and feelings would not leave me.Was there something wrong with me? WhyWe utilize co kies to improve our si e and your experience when using it.

A deep pit of despair, depression, and desolation formed inside me like a grow-ing tumor I could not carve out. If even God cannot save me from myself, all I have left is shame.Shame I will bring to my family when they \u0000nd out; shame my friends will carry for having to associatewith a person who cannot \u0000x his error. You cannot \u0000x this no matter how hard you try. What must havehappened to you to cause this?I was born and raised in McComb, Mississippi. McComb is one of those small towns where everyoneknows everyone. There was never a trip to the local store without running into someone you know.Poverty is rampant — the median income for the city comes in at $27,000 with almost half of the cityfalling under the poverty line. In terms of religiosity, 63% of the city identi\u0000es as either Catholic,Evangelical, or Baptist, though the number is surely higher. The two threads that tie the town togetherare poverty and religion.As a teen, I struggled with acceptance ofmyself. I was a broke kid attending a publicschool in a heavily religious society strug-gling with his sexuality. Anything consid-ered outside of the norm is chastised andkept out of the forefront to avoid any fur-ther exposure. In the South, rather thanfacing problems head-on, we prefer topretend like they do not exist. “Let Go andLet God” is an all-too-often heard saying,and it permeates every aspect of Southernlife and culture. Religion is the blood thatruns through the veins of the county, the state, and the culture. Even in a room full of people, you areall alone.As many may know from their own experience, Christianity has traditionally taken a negative stanceagainst homosexuality. The Church views homosexuality as a sin as established in the Old Testament. Viewing a part of someone’s being as a sin is the basis of the oft-heard saying, “I support you, I just donot support your lifestyle.” The natural way to interpret this, of course, is to see that a person loves youdespite the abomination that you are. What is my lifestyle? Is acceptance of self a lifestyle?All I knew in my youth was the idea that homosexuality was a sin, not a part of self. I was raisedCatholic — the hell\u0000re and brimstone kind. For many years of my adolescence, I believed that any timeI had an ailment or a problem in my life, it was traceable to a mistake I made. Even headaches meant Ihad upset God in some way. Needless to say, homosexuality was not an issue that any church I hadever attended accepted. Naturally, as I reached adolescence and began to realize I was interested inmen, I could never let anyone know. I could not understand what I had done to deserve this, as surely,We utilize cookies to improve our site and your expe ience when using it.

I could not pray hard enough and it was becausethere was something broken within me. I had no one to blame but myself, as God would not haveburdened me with this evil otherwise. How could anyone ever love me if I can never love myself? Howcould I be okay with myself if my very existence is a sin?These thoughts nearly killed me several times. Thoughts of suicide came daily and depression was a\u0000ght I just could not seem to win. I could not share with anyone what I was dealing with out of fear ofrejection – or judgment – thus, I kept these thoughts to myself. The lack of acceptance was evident allaround me: in church, school, my daily life; in the passing conversations people have when they do notknow who you truly are. No one can know because no one will love you. This is a burden you carryyourself. You hear what they say.EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL PRESSURE LEADS US TOPSYCHOLOGICAL TORTUREMy story is not unique, and those who end up on the receivingend of ‘talk therapy’ fare worse. The most unique aspect of mystory is that I was eventually able to overcome these thoughtsabout myself with support around me. I learned that harboring allthe anger within myself for who I was did nothing to change me.Unfortunately, many did not have those same support groups Ihad. I had a mother who accepted me for who I was and a groupof friends who supported me when I \u0000nally felt con\u0000dent enoughto share myself.The pressures discussed above combine to create an environ-ment where a person wants to escape from themselves. They willreach for many harmful practices o\u0000ered up as a ‘solution,’ andend up in some form of GCT, whether with a faith leader or atherapist. Many LGBTQ+ individuals report feeling unwelcome or pressured by their religious peers toseek redemption from their sexuality. Further, LGBTQ+ people were pressured to ‘talk therapy’ by theirfamilies, or the societal pressures described above. Several in my own life are gone now because ofthe societal pressures that cause individuals to feel as if they should be ashamed of their sexuality.LGBTQ+ individuals are eight times more likely to have attempted suicide than their straight counter-parts, six times more likely to have depression, and three times more likely to develop a drug habit.What drives this number? There are several factors to look to for the answer to this question, but themain answers stem from religion, family, and location. While all religion is not anti-LGBTQ+, the ideathat “homosexuality is a sin” has been commonplace in our society since the founding of this country.We utilize cookies to improve our site and your experience when using it.

It isat the very core of this belief that we get the idea of GCT, or as it is called in the circles that accept it,“reparative therapy.”THE HOMOSEXUALITY CURE“Male homosexuals,” Dr. Samuel Hadden remarked, “are more treatable than is generally believed.” Dr.Hadden believed homosexuality stemmed from a negative relationship with their parents, and formales, an “unhealthy” relationship with the mother. In other words, he believed that homosexuality wasa result of having an absent father. This belief permeated the psychiatric community in the 19th cen-tury, although it was called “reparative therapy” at the time. Psychiatry viewed homosexuality as amental illness that could be cured or “conditioned” out of a person. Doctors used extremely barbaricpractices in the name of psychiatry during this time that included lobotomies, electro-shock therapy,and ‘aversion therapy.’ Look at the lengths they will go to \u0000x you.Aversion therapy involved doctors using techniques that forced association of homosexual thoughtswith something negative so they could ‘cure’ the ‘disease’ through this form of association. For exam-ple, some doctors would use electric shocks to a male’s genitals when the patient was presented witha photo of another naked male in an attempt to force the association of pain with their sexuality. Othertimes, LGBTQ+ individuals were put in mental asylums and given lobotomies in an attempt to ‘cure’them of their ‘disorder.’This form of psychological torture was dis-credited beginning in the late seventies;however, this alone did not mean that thepractice ended. Psychiatry began categoriz-ing negative feelings towards one’s own sex-uality as “ego-dystonic sexual orientation”,which meant it was internalized homophobiathat made a person sick, not the sexuality it-self. This belief still permeates some circlestoday. While the psychiatric \u0000eld began tostray away from these types of barbaricpractices, the religious community picked upwhere the doctors had left o\u0000.When doctors started denouncing various forms of GCT, churches \u0000lled the void. Ex-gay ministriesstarted cropping up during the years where the psychiatric community began retracting their stanceson homosexuality.

Those who grew up in conserva-tive and religious families were more likely to be sent to these ministries as a possible treatment fortheir sexuality. One such group, Love in Action, found massive enrollment into the program during thelate seventies. While the creator of this group eventually came out and admitted that the program didnothing but cause depression in those who found out they would never be “cured” no matter howmuch they prayed or pretended to be straight, the damage had already been done. In his own words,the creator described what his work had wrought:These type of statements are all too common from the ex-leaders of these types of ministries. A com-mon thread seemed to be that they all knew what they had done was wrong, as they experienced thesame pains themselves, and yet, they continued to encourage many LGBTQ+ individuals to join theirministries.With the rise and fall of GCT within the psychiatric community and the subsequent re-emergence of itin religious circles, those tasked with exposing the world to the dangers of the psychological torture itput people through failed. While the American Psychiatric Association made note of the possibility ofdepression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety tied to these types of therapy, they stopped short of ban-ning the use of it by their doctors. The void in communication related to the dangers this posed toLGBTQ+ youth led to the continued acceptance, or at the very least acquiescence, of GCT into thepresent era. The LGBTQ+ rights movement that was propelled from the Stonewall Riots began to pushback on many of the failures of professionals in the psychiatric \u0000eld in terms of spreading the truth ofthe dangers that exist — not because of our sexuality — but because of the way that society treats it.WHAT’S THE LAW GOT TO DO WITH IT?I realized that through my own desperate attempts to altermy own sexuality, I also led thousands of others down thatfraught path. Year after year, the same stories surfacedabout distressed people falling away to their own shamecaused by the conditional messages that if they didn’t be-come ‘straight’ it was their own fault.“We utilize cookies to improve our site and your experience when using it.

To many, these rulings meant the LGBTQ+rights movement had been vindicated. However, forthose of us who identify as LGBTQ+, we knew the\u0000ght was just beginning. LGBTQ+ youth still face im-mense challenges in their day-to-day lives, fromtheir families, friends, communities, and churches.The daily struggle that exists within a person: thefear, the shame, the doubt, the pain, cannot be merely legislated or waived away. The deep stains ofthe past still tarnish the tattered \u0000ag of equality, and though we scrub until our hands are prune, deepdown we know it will take more than a mere rinse to remove this blemish.With the issues of marriage and adoption being settled by the Supreme Court, LGBTQ+ rights began totake a backseat in the media. Issues like employment, housing, discrimination, and how to addressyouth LGBTQ+ issues fell out of the news. However, this did not mean the problem did not exist. Quitethe opposite. According to the UCLA Williams Institute, 16,000 youth will be subject to gay conversiontherapy in the 32 states that still allow this practice to continue. Almost a million LGBTQ+ individualscurrently alive in the United States have been put through GCT at some point in their lives. Accordingto that same study, almost 10,000 youth will be saved from GCT by living in states that currently banthe practice.However, there have been challenges to the laws that ban conversion therapy, and the lower courtshave not come to a consensus on the constitutionality of these bans. In 2020, a Trump-appointedjudge in Florida ruled that bans on gay conversion therapy violated the First Amendment right to freespeech, which resulted in the ability of therapists to use this barbaric practice once again.In that case, a group of religious therapists challenged the ban of GCT on the youth in Boca Raton.They argued that the banning of certain types of therapy infringed on their First Amendment right tofree speech. While the District Court for the Southern District of Florida denied their request for a pre-liminary injunction, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision and scorned the lower court for not ad-dressing the case. According to the record, the therapists argued that the prohibitions on therapy werespeech-related restrictions that could not survive constitutional analysis.

The city argued in the alternative that because of seri-ous health risks posed to the youth by subjecting them to this type of controversial therapy, it had acompelling governmental interest in regulating this type of speech.The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals was not swayed by the city’s argument. The majority stated that“whether therapy is prohibited only on the contents of the words used in that therapy, and the ban onthat content is because the government disagrees with it. And whether the government’s disagree-ment is for good reasons, great reasons, or terrible reasons has nothing to do with it.” The court did not\u0000nd statements from the American Psychological Association (APA) and many other medical profes-sionals convincing:  “we cannot allow a new consensus to justify restrictions on speech.”  After all, thecourt opined, the APA itself recognized homosexuality as a mental illness until the 1970s. “People whohurt children can be held accountable,” the court stated, but the way this happens is through “tort lawand malpractice suits, not First Amendment regulations.”This ruling showed a fundamental misunderstanding of what GCT entails, and the level of protectionthe supposed ‘speech’ should receive. Regulations on protected speech are analyzed under strictscrutiny, which requires the government to put forth a compelling interest in regulating the speech atissue, as well as prove that the law is narrowly tailored to address the problem. Under this level ofscrutiny, laws are rarely upheld on the local level, as a recent report found that only 17% of local lawsare upheld under a strict scrutiny analysis. It was under this strict scrutiny test that the Eleventh CircuitCourt of Appeals found the laws unconstitutional, as Boca Raton was not able to show that the gov-ernment had a “compelling interest” in censoring the speech. If the well-being of the youth and an in-terest in protecting our minors from harm in a psychiatric setting is not a compelling interest, what pos-sibly would be?The law, it is important to note, does not prevent a therapist from expressing the view that homosexu-ality is morally wrong, nor does it prevent them from o\u0000ering alternative views as to how to confrontsexuality. What the law did, however, was prevent licensed therapists from attempting to change aperson’s sexuality. As modern medicine and psychiatry has found, the only outcomes observed con-cerning this practice were increases in self-harm, suicidal thought, depression, self-hate, and in theworst cases, suicide.Indeed, as the dissent in this case noted, there was a plethora of information proving evidence of theharmful outcomes related to GCT being used on our youth. However, as Justice Martin stated in thedissent, “it seems that no study would satisfy the majority” into believing that the government has aright to regulate this type of ‘therapy.’ Judge Martin found that even under a strict scrutiny analysis,We utilize cookies to improve our site and your experience when using it.

When discussing this issue in a First Amendment context, it is easy to removea face from this issue. What we are talking about is using a therapist to attempt to remove a portion ofone’s self through prayer or conditioning. Sexuality is not ‘removable,’ any more than sex or race canbe. Further, the idea that the government does not have a compelling interest in preventing this type ofpsychological abuse against already struggling group of our youth is not based on reality or law. Wedo not allow doctors to o\u0000er archaic treatments proven not to work. The courts have had no problemupholding laws that ban doctors from o\u0000ering assisted suicide. So how is it that something proven todo nothing but cause potentially fatal harm to the youth could be found to be covered as protectedfree speech?The Ninth Circuit seemed to follow the same rationale I have expressed here. In Pickup v. Brown, an-other GCT case, the court found that the laws banning GCT were a valid exercise of the police powersof the state. The court found that there are three levels to First Amendment protection for profession-als with varying levels of protection for each. When professionals are engaged in “public dialogue,”protections are at their strongest. The next level exists “within the con\u0000nes of a professional relation-ship,” an area in which First Amendment rights are diminished in favor of state regulations. The leastprotective level exists at the point of “professional conduct,” at which point the state’s powers to regu-late are at their highest. The state \u0000nds that the law in question regulates “conduct,” as it does not pre-vent the therapist from discussing the bene\u0000ts or negatives of using GCT. “Pursuant to it’s police power,[the state] has authority to regulate licensed medical health providers administration of therapies thatthe legislature has deemed harmful.” As the court stressed, the First Amendment “does not prevent astate from regulating treatment even when that treatment is performed through speech alone.”As stated above, the Supreme Court has thus far refused to hear any challenges to laws banning GCT.While the refusal to hear challenges to the bans may seem like a win for advocates of the laws, thishas resulted in a mixed bag of jurisprudence from the circuit courts in relation to the issue. To makematters even more di\u0000cult, even in the states that have successfully kept their laws, there is a gapingde\u0000ciency: none of these laws regulate non-licensed leaders, like religious groups, from continuingthe practice. Of course, to regulate a religious body would be to begin regulating religion and belief, sothis would not be practical, but it is an important piece of the topic that needs some further detail toexplain why this practice will not be going anywhere anytime soon.WHAT CAN WE DO?This \u0000ght starts in our homes. It starts in our pews, at our dinner tables.

That a parent would subject their child to what amounts to psy-chological torture to ‘\u0000x’ them would indicate that the harms of this practice have not been adequatelycommunicated. So, the next time you hear a conversation, the next time you hear someone using agay slur, the next time you hear someone tell another that “they love them, they just don’t love theirlifestyle,” remember to push back on that statement. It is in our own lives that we begin the work ofchanging perceptions and views. Telling our youth that they can be “\u0000xed” of their sexuality has noplace in modern society and results in nothing but pain, depression, and suicide for those who havedealt with the e\u0000ects of this mentality. It is far past time for us to begin to pick up the pieces around usso that we can work towards a better society for all, not just some.This practice will continue in religious circles, re-gardless of the laws that may ban it from psycholo-gists and therapists’ o\u0000ces. However, there existssome hope that even within those circles, minds arebeginning to change. Pope Francis recently spoke atlength about LGBTQ+ individuals: “When God looksat a gay person, does he endorse the existence ofthis person with love, or reject and condemn thisperson? We must always consider the person.” Thismay not seem like much to many, but for theCatholic Church, this is a huge step in the right direc-tion. Religious leaders of the Mormon Church, theCatholic Church, and other denominations indicated recently they support the bans of the practice,which is a welcome break from historical support. To date, over three-hundred religious leadershave called for the end to these controversial practices. Even the nation’s leading GCT ministry re-cently came out against the practice and admitted that he has done more harm than good as well asadmitting the practice never “cured” him of his sexuality. However, sometimes it is not merely the pres-sure from a therapist or a religious leader that leads an LGBTQ+ individual to GCT, but something muchdeeper: our inner shame.It was not a therapist or a preacher that led me down the path of trying to rid myself of my sexuality. Itwas a combination of a lifetime worth of being told homosexuality was a sin, society condemningsame-sex marriage, and hearing friends use homophobic phrases anytime they sought to expresstheir displeasure about an issue that helped build the negative stereotype I held of myself. “That’s gay!”has been a phrase in the English lexicon so long that you will even hear LGBTQ+ people say it. Whilelaws can go a long way in preventing children from being subject to what I \u0000nd to be psychologicaltorture, the issue still exists within the youth struggling to come to terms with themselves. We must dobetter at communicating to our youth that there is nothing wrong with being LGBTQ+, and that e\u0000ortstarts at home with our family, friends, and associates. Sometimes even small talk can stick with a per-son forever and become the focal point for every negative thought they harbor about themselves.

Lifting up those who feel they havenowhere else to turn while trying to navigate the complexities of the American justice system is thefoundation upon which my dreams are built. Together, there is always a way.law can prevent this from happening, so this is an issue we, as a society, will have to address withoutthe court’s assistance.You can get through this. You are not broken. You are you, and there is nothing in the world you shouldbe more proud of.SHARE THIS:Twitter FacebookLIKE THIS:Loading...Like this post?

    "abstract": "In the United States, gay conversion therapy (GCT) has not been banned nationally, although twenty states have issued laws banning therapists from practicing it. While the Supreme Court has refused to hear several cases involving challenges to laws banning GCT, recently the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals found a local law banning the practice as an unconstitutional regulation on the First Amendment right of speech. This ruling disappointingly confuses ideas of First Amendment protections with what amounts to psychological torture of our youth. It must be noted that while bans on GCT have been successfully upheld as constitutional in other regions, the laws only ban the practice for licensed therapists, not for clergy or any other religiously affiliated organization who wish to use the practice on the youth. This distinction will be discussed later",
