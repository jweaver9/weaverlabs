These studies \ninclude surveys of LGBT individuals’ workplace experiences, wage comparisons between LGB and heterosexual \npersons, analyses of discrimination complaints filed with administrative agencies, and testing studies and \ncontrolled experiments.  This report summarizes findings from these studies. \n \nWhen surveyed, 16% to 68% of LGBT people report experiencing employment discrimination. \n \nStudies conducted from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s revealed that 16% to 68% of LGB respondents reported \nexperiencing employment discrimination at some point in their lives.  Since the mid-1990s, an additional fifteen \nstudies found that 15% to 43% of LGB \nrespondents experienced discrimination in the \nworkplace. \n \nWhen asked more specific questions about the \ntype of discrimination experienced, LGB \nrespondents reported the following experiences \nthat were related to their sexual orientation:  8%-\n17% were fired or denied employment, 10%-28% \nwere denied a promotion or given negative \nperformance evaluations, 7%-41% were \nverbally/physically abused or had their workplace \nvandalized, and 10%-19% reported receiving \nunequal pay or benefits. \n \nFifteen to 57% of transgender people also report experiencing employment discrimination. \n \nWhen transgender individuals were surveyed separately, they reported similar or higher levels of employment \ndiscrimination.  In six studies conducted between 1996 and 2006, 20% to 57% of transgender respondents \nreported having experienced employment discrimination at some point in their life.  More specifically, 13%-\n56% were fired, 13%-47% were denied employment, 22%-31% were harassed, and 19% were denied a \npromotion based on their gender identity. \n \nWhen surveyed, many heterosexual co-workers report witnessing sexual orientation \ndiscrimination in the workplace. \n \nA small number of researchers have also asked heterosexuals whether they have witnessed discrimination \nagainst their LGB peers.  These studies revealed that 12% to 30% of respondents in certain occupations, such \nas the legal profession, have witnessed antigay discrimination in employment. \n \nIn states that currently prohibit sexual orientation discrimination, LGB people file complaints of \nemployment discrimination at similar rates to women and racial minorities. \n \nIndividual complaints of discrimination filed with government agencies provide another measure of perceived \ndiscrimination.  The General Accounting Office (or “GAO”, now known as the Government Accountability Office) \ncollected the number of complaints filed in states that outlaw sexual orientation discrimination and found that \n1% of all discrimination complaints related to sexual orientation.  However, comparisons of data from ten \nstates show that the rate of sexual orientation discrimination complaints per GLB person is 3 per 10,000, which \nis roughly equivalent to gender-based discrimination complaints. \n \n \n  \nGender v. Sexual Orientation \n \n       Raw Data       Population-Adjusted Data \n           \n \nGay men earn 10% to 32% less than similarly qualified heterosexual men.  \n \nA wage or income gap between LGB people and heterosexual people with the same job and personal \ncharacteristics provides another indicator of sexual orientation discrimination.  A growing number of studies \nusing data from the National Health and Social Life Survey (“NHSLS”), the General Social Survey (“GSS”), the \nUnited States Census, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (“NHANES III”) show that gay \nmen earn 10% to 32% less than otherwise similar heterosexual men.  The findings for lesbians, however, are \nless clear.  In some studies they earn more than heterosexual women but less than heterosexual or gay men.  \n \nTransgender people report high rates of unemployment and very low earnings. \n \nWhile no detailed wage and income analyses of the transgender population have been conducted to date, \nconvenience samples of the transgender population find that 6%-60% of respondents report being \nunemployed, and 22-64% of the employed population earns less than $25,000 per year. \n \nControlled experiments reveal sexual orientation discrimination in workplace settings. \n \nIn controlled experiments, researchers manufacture scenarios that allow comparisons of the treatment of LGB \npeople with treatment of heterosexuals.  Seven out of eight studies using controlled experiments related to \nemployment and public accommodation find evidence of sexual orientation discrimination.  \n \nDespite the variations in methodology, context, and time period in the studies reviewed in this \nreport, our review of  the evidence demonstrates one disturbing and consistent pattern: sexual \norientation-based and gender identity discrimination is a common occurrence in many \nworkplaces across the country. \n  \nTable of Contents  \n \n \nSelf-Reported Experiences of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Employment \nDiscrimination ........................................................................................................ 2 \nSurveys Measuring Sexual Orientation Discrimination ............................................. 2 \nLiterature Reviews............................................................................................ 2 \nNational Random Samples ................................................................................ 3 \nOther National Samples .................................................................................... 3 \nRecent Convenience Samples of Specific Geographic Areas.................................. 3 \nSurveys of Heterosexual Co-Workers ................................................................. 4 \nMethods and Limitations of Surveys of LGB People.............................................. 4 \nSurveys Measuring Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Transgender \nStatus................................................................................................................. 7 \nConvenience Samples ....................................................................................... 7 \nMethodology and Limitations of Surveys of Transgender People........................... 9 \nGlossary of Terms ............................................................................................ 9 \nAdministrative Complaints Filed About Discrimination............................................... 11 \nWage Evidence of Sexual Orientation Discrimination................................................ 12 \nBackground on Data and Methodology ................................................................ 12 \nPatterns in the Findings ..................................................................................... 12 \nMeasuring the Effects of Antidiscrimination Laws: A Wage-Based Approach............ 16 \nWages of Transgender People ............................................................................ 16 \nControlled Experiments ......................................................................................... 18 \nBackground on Data and Methodology ................................................................ 18 \nStudies of Employment ...................................................................................... 18 \nStudies of Public Accommodations ...................................................................... 19 \nIssues Related to Interpretation of Results .......................................................... 20 \nConclusions.......................................................................................................... 21 \nReferences........................................................................................................... 22 \nAcknowledgements ............................................................................................... 27 \nAbout the Authors................................................................................................. 27 \nAbout the Institute................................................................................................ 27 \n \n1  \nBias in the Workplace: Consistent Evidence of Sexual \nOrientation and Gender Identity Discrimination \n \nOver the last ten years, academic researchers in \neconomics, sociology, psychology, and other social \nsciences have conducted research to find out \nwhether lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \n(“LGBT”) people face employment discrimination.  \nGovernment and community organizations have \nalso conducted such research.  With increasing \nfrequency, policymakers at the federal, state, and \nlocal level are considering the rates of employment \ndiscrimination as they consider laws that would \nban employment discrimination based on sexual \norientation and gender identity.  In this report we \nsummarize the findings of research about \nemployment discrimination against LGBT people \nfrom four different kinds of studies. \n \nSurveys of LGBT people’s experiences with \nworkplace discrimination \nThese studies routinely show that considerable \nnumbers of LGBT people believe they have been \ndiscriminated against in the workplace.  These \nstudies also show that heterosexuals perceive \ndiscrimination against their LGB peers.  Because \nthese studies tend to focus on particular \noccupations, population groups, or geographic \nareas, the rates of perceived discrimination vary \nconsiderably across their findings. \nAnalyses of employment discrimination \ncomplaints filed with government agencies \nThus far, there has been one published study on \nthe number of sexual orientation discrimination \ncomplaints filed with government agencies.  \nAlthough the raw number of complaints is small, \nthe rate of complaints per 10,000 LGB people is \ncomparable to the rate of sex discrimination \ncomplaints per 10,000 women. \n \nAnalyses of wage differentials between LGBT \nand heterosexual persons \nEmployment discrimination often translates into \nlower earnings.  Wage analyses consistently show \nthat gay men earn 10% to 32% less than \nheterosexual men.  The findings on lesbians’ \nearnings are less consistent.  While less data is \navailable about the incomes of transgender people \nin comparison with non-transgender people, a \nnumber of surveys have found high unemployment \nrates and low income levels for transgender \npeople. \nControlled experiments \nA new and expanding line of research involves \nexperiments that control conditions to test whether \nLGB people experience differences in treatment \nwhen compared with identical heterosexual people.  \nThese studies find that LGB and heterosexual \npersons are subject to disparate treatment. \n \nThe remainder of this report describes the studies’ \nmethods and findings.  The methodologies used \nand contexts studied vary considerably and limit \nour ability to generalize findings to all locations, \noccupations, or economic contexts.  Also, the \nlimitations of the methods mean that we cannot \nsay how likely a LGBT person would be to \nexperience employment discrimination.  Despite \nthese caveats, the review does demonstrate a \nconsistent pattern:  there is ample evidence that \nsexual orientation and gender identity \ndiscrimination against LGBT people occurs in many \nworkplaces across the country. \n2  \nSelf-Reported Experiences of Sexual Orientation and \nGender Identity Employment Discrimination \n \nSurveys Measuring Sexual Orientation \nDiscrimination \n   \nOne way that researchers have assessed \ndiscrimination is by asking LGB people directly \nwhether they believe they have experienced \ndiscrimination.  These studies routinely show that \nmany LGB individuals believe that they have \nexperienced employment discrimination.  Tables 1 \nand 2 present details of the studies. \nLiterature Reviews \nFive academic reviews of such studies that were \npublished between 1992 and 1999 found \nsubstantial evidence of discrimination.  These \nreviews, examining over 35 studies, found that \n16% to 68% of LGB respondents reported \nexperiencing discrimination in the workplace (see \nTable 1).  Since these literature reviews were \npublished, an additional fifteen surveys have been \nconducted that report similar findings. \n \n \nTable 1:  Literature reviews examining studies published between 1992 and 1999\n \nStudy Year(s) \nData \nCollected  \nPopulation Method % Reporting \nDiscrimination \nEver (unless \notherwise \nnoted) \nSpecific Types of \nDiscrimination \nExperienced  \nBadgett \net al. \n(1992) \n1992 Review of 1 national survey \nand 20 city and state surveys \nof LGB people (n of 21 \nsurveys = 11,984 ) \nLiterature \nReview  \n16-44% 8-19% fired  \n5-24% denied \nemployment \n5-33% denied a \npromotion \n3-14% bad job rating or \nevaluation \nBadgett \n(1997) \n1997 Review of 3 city surveys and \n6 surveys of various \nprofessional groups of LGB \npeople (n of 9 surveys = \n8,221) \nLiterature \nReview  \n27-68%  \nCroteau \n(1996)  \n1996 Review of 9 published studies \non work experiences of LGB \npeople, with 3 studies \nreporting experiences of \ndiscrimination \n(n of 3 surveys = 626) \nLiterature \nReview  \n25-66%  \nDurkin \n(1998) \n1998 Review of 11 studies of \nsexual orientation bias in the \nlegal profession, 2  reporting \nexperiences of discrimination  \n(n of 2 surveys = 293) \nLiterature \nReview  \n23-40%   \nFox, \nSarah D. \n(1999) \n1999 Review of 2 studies on sexual \norientation employment \ndiscrimination  \n(n of 2 surveys = 378) \nLiterature \nReview \n41-58%  \n \n 3\n \nFifteen recent \nstudies found that \n15% to 43% of \nLGB respondents \nexperienced  \nworkplace \ndiscrimination. \nNational Random Samples \nThree recent surveys are based on national \nprobability samples (or “random” samples) of \nlesbian, gay, and bisexual people. \n \n• In 2000, the Henry J. Kaiser Family \nFoundation (2001) surveyed a random \nsample of 405 LGB people in 15 large \nmetropolitan areas and found that 18% of \nthe respondents reported experiencing \ndiscrimination when applying for a job or \nkeeping a job. \n• Another study analyzed data from the 1995 \nNational Survey of Midlife Development, a \nnationally representative sample of adults \naged 25 to 74 years old, and revealed that \nLGB respondents reported the following \ntypes of \n“discrimination”:  8% \nreported being fired, \n13% being denied \nemployment, and \n11% being denied a \npromotion (Vickie \nMays and Susan \nCochran 2001).  \nWhile the survey did \nnot ask LGB \nrespondents whether each type of \nemployment discrimination was related to \ntheir sexual orientation, 43% of LGB \nrespondents said that some discrimination \nthey experienced was due to their sexual \norientation (Mays and Cochran 2001). \n• Another recent survey of a random sample \nfound that 10% of LGB people (16% of \nlesbians and gay men) reported being fired \nor denied a job because of their sexual \norientation (Gregory Herek, 2007). \nOther National Samples \nTwo other national studies of non-random samples \nalso found that self-reported experiences of \ndiscrimination were common and that respondents \nreported facing a variety of discrimination in the \nemployment context. \n \n• The most recent survey, conducted in 2006, \nfound that 7% of the 662 LGB respondents \nhad reported experiencing job discrimination \nat some point in their lives. \n• A survey conducted at the end of 2005, \nfound that 39% of the 1,205 LGBT \nrespondents have experienced some level of \nharassment or discrimination in their \nworkplace over the past five years (Lambda \nLegal and Deloitte 2006). \n• Similar rates of discrimination were \ndocumented in a survey by Out & Equal in \n2002, which found that 41% of participants \nhad experienced discrimination in the \nworkplace (2002). \nRecent Surveys of Specific Areas \nEight other studies of sexual orientation \ndiscrimination surveyed narrower subgroups of the \nLGB population focusing on people in a particular \ngeographic area.  These studies recruit \n“convenience” samples, or samples of LGB people \nwho are easy to locate and willing to return a \nsurvey.  These survey respondents may not be \nrepresentative of the larger population of LGB \npeople.  These studies also show experiences of \nperceived employment discrimination on the basis \nof sexual orientation are common. 1 \n \n• 30% of LGBT people in Pennsylvania \nreported discrimination. \n• 36% of New Yorkers reported employment \ndiscrimination during the five years prior to \nthe 2001 survey. \n• 11.2% of GB men in three southwestern \ncities reported experiencing employment, \nhousing or insurance discrimination in the \nsix months prior to the survey. \n• 15% of GB Latino men in Los Angeles, New \nYork City, and Miami reported experiencing \nemployment discrimination. \n• In a survey of LGB residents of Topeka, \nKansas, 15%-41% reported employment \ndiscrimination and on-the-job harassment. \n• 27% of the 195 northern Floridians surveyed \nreported experiencing employment \ndiscrimination. \n                                                 \n1 Two other surveys also indicate high levels of \ndiscrimination against LGBT people of color, although \nneither survey defined discrimination to be limited to, \nor even include, employment discrimination.  In 2005 \nand 2007, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force’s \nPolicy Institute released two reports on Asian Pacific \nAmerican and Islander LGBT individuals showing that \n75%-82% of the respondents from the two surveys \nreported experience with sexual orientation \ndiscrimination or prejudice of some kind (Alain Dang \n& Mandy Hu 2005; Alain Dang & Cabrini Vianney \n2007).  Another survey of participants from nine Black \nPride events in 2000 by the Policy Institute found that \n42% of black LGBT respondents reported having \nexperienced discrimination or prejudice of some kind.  \n(Battle et al. 2002). \n \n 4\n \nHeterosexual  \nco-workers report \nwitnessing \ndiscrimination \nagainst their LGB \npeers \n• 30% of LGB people from fourteen of the \nsixteen counties across Maine reported \nexperiencing discrimination in employment. \n• 43% of Washington State Pride event \nattendees reported experiencing \nemployment discrimination. \n• 21% of the LGB attorneys in Minnesota law \nfirms reported being denied employment, \nequal pay, equal benefits, a promotion, or \nanother employment opportunity. \n• LGBT members of the California State Bar \nreported that 26% had been denied a \npromotion, 15% received unequal pay, and \n19% received poor work assignments. \n• LG employees of the New Jersey Supreme \nCourt reported that 17% were denied \nemployment, 29% were teased or harassed, \nand 21% were given poor work \nassignments. \nSurveys of Heterosexual Co-Workers \nA small number of researchers have asked \nheterosexuals whether they have witnessed \ndiscrimination against their LGB peers.  These \nstudies have been limited to particular occupations, \nmainly the legal profession. \n \n• In a survey of heterosexual attorneys in \nMinnesota law firms, 23% believe that LGBT \nattorneys were treated differently, with an \nadditional 32% stating that they were not \ncertain. \n• New Jersey Court system employees \nreported seeing sexual orientation \ndiscrimination: 7% reporting witnessing \ndiscrimination in hiring, 10% witnessed \nverbal abuse or harassment of LGBT \ncoworkers, and 6% reported witnessing \ndiscrimination in the distribution of work \nassignments. \n• 30% of the judges and attorneys surveyed \nin Arizona believe that lesbians and gays \nwere discriminated against in the legal \nprofession. \n• 12% to 14% of heterosexual political \nscientists reported witnessing antigay \ndiscrimination in academic employment \ndecisions, such as hiring and tenure \ndecisions. \n• In Los Angeles, 24% of female heterosexual \nlawyers and 17% of male heterosexual \nreported either having experienced or \nwitnessed anti-gay discrimination. \n \nMethods and Limitations of Surveys  \nAlthough these studies provide a useful snapshot \nof LGB individuals’ perceptions, they have certain \nlimitations.  As already noted, the samples used for \nmost studies were not representative of the larger \nLGB population.  Many of these studies only \nsurveyed individuals in a particular geographic \nregion, occupation, or population group.  Almost all \nwere convenience samples, as opposed to random \nor probability samples.  Individuals who have been \nsubject to sexual orientation discrimination may \nhave been more likely to participate in such \nsurveys, skewing the rate of discrimination \nreported.  Therefore, we cannot necessarily apply \nthese findings to all LGB people.  \n \nTwo other limitations related to these studies’ \nreliance on perceptions of discrimination are worth \nnoting.  First, people’s perceptions may not be \naccurate measures of actual discrimination.  For \nexample, individuals may misperceive employers’ \nmotivations behind hiring and promotion decisions, \nascribing discriminatory motives to employers \nwhen none existed.  \nAlternatively, employers may \nconceal their discriminatory \nmotives so well that LGB \npeople perceive less \ndiscrimination than actually \nexists. \n \nSecond, many of these \nstudies had vague definitions \nof “discrimination” and some did not define the \nterm at all.  In addition, the questions asking about \nemployment discrimination were worded differently \nin each of the surveys.  “Discrimination” included \neverything from denials of promotions to being \nsubjected to “hard stares” because of one’s sexual \norientation (Martin P. Levine and Robin Leonard \n1984; James M. Croteau and Julianne S. Lark \n1995).  The variations in definitions and the \nwording of questions may also explain why the \nstudies found varying levels of perceived \ndiscrimination. \n \n \n5 \nTable 2:  Results of surveys measuring employment discrimination against LGB people on the basis of sexual orientation since 1999 \nStudy Year(s) \nData \nCollected  \nPopulation Method  % Reporting \nDiscrimination Ever \n(unless otherwise noted) \nSpecific Types of Discrimination Experienced \nColvin R.

Details of these studies are presented in \nTable 3. \n \nConvenience Samples \nAll of the surveys measuring employment \ndiscrimination against transgender people relied \nupon convenience samples.  Only one was national \nin scope.  The other studies focused on a particular \ngeographic area or population group.  Most were \nbased on the transgender population in San \nFrancisco.  Despite these limitations, the studies \nconsistently found that between 15% and 57% of \ntransgender people report experiencing \nemployment discrimination on the basis of \ntransgender status or gender identity.  \n \n• Nationally, 37% reported experiencing \nemployment discrimination.  \n• 25% of transsexuals from Northern \nCalifornia had difficulties getting a job. \n• A study of 244 transsexuals in Los Angeles \nCounty found that 28% reported being fired \nbased on their gender identity and 47% \nreported difficulty in finding a job.  \n• In a study of 248 transgender people of \ncolor in Washington, D.C., 15% reported \nlosing a job because of their transgender \nstatus.  \n• 37-42% of gender variant persons in Illinois \nreported experiencing some type of \nemployment discrimination. \n• A study of male-to-female (MTF) \ntransgender people of color in San Francisco \nfound that 39% reported losing a job or a \ncareer opportunity because of their gender \nidentity. \n• 20% of transgender persons in Virginia \nreported employment discrimination, with \n13% fired, 20% denied employment and \n31% harassed at work. \n \nThe most recent survey of transgender individuals \nwas conducted in 2006 by the San Francisco Bay \nGuardian and the Transgender Law Center (San \nFrancisco Bay Guardian and Transgender Law \nCenter 2006).  The survey was specifically focused \non employment issues, using a \nvery broad definition of being \ntransgender, and sought to \nrecruit a broad cross-section of \nSan Francisco’s transgender \npopulation.  The study found that \n57% of the transgender \nrespondents surveyed had \nexperienced employment \ndiscrimination on the basis of their transgender \nstatus or gender identity.  More specifically, of \nthose surveyed, 18% reported being fired, 40% \nbeing denied employment, 19% being denied a \npromotion, and 22% being verbally harassed.  In \naddition, 24% reported being sexually harassed, \n14% lacked access to appropriate restrooms, 23% \nreported persistent use of their old name and/or \npronoun, and 12% faced persistent questions \nabout surgery.  In other words, this survey found \nample evidence of many forms of discrimination in \nwhat should be one of the most tolerant cities for \ntransgender people in the United States. \n \n 8\n \nTable 3:  Results of surveys measuring employment discrimination against transgender people on the basis of transgender \nstatus or gender identity \nStudy Year(s) Data \nCollected  \nPopulation Method  % Reporting Discrimination Ever \n(unless otherwise noted) \nClements K., \net al.

For \nexample, they were all based on convenience \nsamples and are generally limited to surveying one \ncity, San Francisco.  In fact, only one was a \nnational in scope.  Although some surveys varied in \nhow they defined discrimination, many of these \nsurveys were based upon each other and \ndeliberately used the same definition of \ndiscrimination.  Thus, there may in fact be greater \nconsistency among these surveys results than in \nothers reviewed by this study. \nThese surveys also have some additional \nlimitations.  Perhaps the most notable one is the \nvariance of the definition of the transgender \npopulation among the surveys.  Some of the \nstudies focused only on MTFs (male-to-female) or \nonly on FTMs (female-to-male).  Some only \nincluded those who self-identity as transsexuals; \none only included pre-operative and post-operative \ntranssexuals, while others included anyone who is \nvisibly “gender variant,” including those who \nidentify as cross-dressers, drag queens, drag kings, \neffeminate males and gender queers.  Some \nstudies explicitly excluded those who identify in \nthese groups from their definition of transgender. \nGlossary of Terms  \nTable 3 and the studies it summarizes use a variety of terms to describe all or parts of the transgender community.  These terms \nrepresent real differences in how the researchers defined the populations which they surveyed.  Below is a short glossary of \nthese terms. \n \nTransgender:  An umbrella term for people whose gender identity, expression, or behavior is different from that typically \nassociated with their assigned sex at birth, including but not limited to transsexuals, cross-dressers, androgynous people, \ngenderqueers, and gender non-conforming people.   \n \nGender Identity:  An individual’s internal sense of being male, female, or something else.  Since gender identity is internal, \none’s gender identity is not necessarily visible to others. \n \nTranssexual:  A term for people whose gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth.  Often, but not always, \ntranssexual people alter their bodies through hormones or surgery in order to make it match their gender identity. \n \nCross-dresser:  A term for people who dress in clothing traditionally or stereotypically worn by the other sex, but who generally \nhave no intent to live full-time as the other gender. \n \nGenderqueer:  A term used by some individuals who identify as neither entirely male nor entirely female.  Genderqueer is an \nidentity more common among young people. \n \nGender non-conforming/gender variant:  A term for individuals whose gender expression is different from the societal \nexpectations based on their assigned sex at birth. \n \nFTM:  A person who has transitioned from “female-to-male,” meaning a person who was assigned female at birth, but now \nidentifies and lives as a male. \n \nMTF:  A person who has transitioned from “male-to-female,” meaning a person who was assigned male at birth, but now \nidentifies and lives as a female \n \nDrag Queen:  Generally used to refer to men who dress as women (often celebrity women) for the purpose of entertaining \nothers at bars, clubs, or other events. \n \nDrag King:  Used to refer to women who dress as men for the purpose of entertaining others at bars, clubs, or other events. \n \nThese definitions are influenced by a variety of sources.

Transgender Equality: A Handbook for Activists and Policymakers.  San Francisco:  National Gay and Lesbian Task Force \nPolicy Institute and National Center for Lesbian Rights. \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \nOnly three of these surveys focused specifically on \nemployment discrimination or violence and \ndiscrimination against transgender people.  Most \nare focused on HIV prevention, prevalence, and \nrisk behaviors.  Some even required participants to \ntake an HIV-test.  Others are more generally \nfocused on the health and social service needs of \nthe transgender population.  As a result, many of \nthese surveys deliberately over-represent clients of \nAIDS service organizations, other social services \norganizations, low income people, and commercial \nsex workers. \n \nFinally, many of the samples may over-represent \ntransgender people of color, although this is \ndifficult to assess with the extremely limited \ninformation available about the demographics of \nthe transgender population.  Many of the studies \nhad samples with high percentages of African-\nAmerican and Latino/a respondents, and some \nwere designed to focus on people of color.  On the \nother hand, two of the surveys noted that they \nunderrepresented people of color. \n \nAnother difference between the transgender \nstudies in Table 3 and the LGB surveys \nsummarized in Table 2 is that over half of the \ntransgender studies were based on face-to-face \ninterviews, and all of the LGB studies were based \non written questionnaires.  It is difficult to assess \nthe impact of the interview method on the \nresponses collected.  On the one hand, interviews \nmight have resulted in less accurate information \nabout employment discrimination if respondents \nwere reluctant to admit experiences of \ndiscrimination.  On the other hand, given that most \nof the surveys were also asking highly personal \nquestions, such as about HIV-status, risky sexual \nbehaviors, drug use, and suicide, respondents \nmight have been desensitized to reporting stressful \ninformation such as experiences of discrimination \nand were, therefore, more likely to report \ndiscrimination they have experienced. \n \nHowever, what was most notable about the entire \nset of transgender studies was the commitment of \nresearchers to having transgender people included \nin every phase of their research—design of the \nsurvey instrument, recruitment, and interviewing.  \nAlmost all of the studies based on interviews used \ntransgender people to conduct all or most of the \ninterviews. \n \n11 \nAdministrative Complaints Filed About Discrimination \n \n \nSurveys are not the only one way to study people’s \nperception of discrimination.  In those states that \nalready prohibit sexual orientation discrimination, \nindividuals can file complaints of discrimination, \nwhich provide a different way of measuring \nperceived discrimination.  Reports by the General \nAccounting Office (now the Government \nAccountability Office) have summarized the \nnumber of complaints filed in states that outlaw \nsexual orientation discrimination (James Rebbe, \nVeronica Sandidge, and Richard Burkard 2002; \nStefanie Weldon and Dayna K. Shah 2000; Author \nUnknown 1997). \n \nIn a report published in 2002, Rubenstein \nexamined legal complaints filed in states that had \noutlawed sexual orientation discrimination.  The \nreport examined data from ten state-level agencies \nthat recorded complaints regarding sexual \norientation discrimination in employment.  \nRubenstein found that the raw number of \ncomplaints for each state was small.  For example, \nin 1995, only 23 people in Connecticut filed \ncomplaints alleging sexual orientation \ndiscrimination (William Rubenstein 2002). \n \nAlthough the actual number of sexual orientation \ndiscrimination complaints per gay person was \nsmall, they were roughly equivalent to the number \nof sex-based discrimination complaints per woman.  \nThe average for the ten states was three \ncomplaints per 10,000 LGB people under the \nassumption that 5% of the U.S. population is LGB, \ncompared with nine gender-related complaints per \n10,000 women and eight race-related complaints \nper 10,000 people of color (Rubenstein 2002). \n \nRubenstein’s research showed that complaint rates \nof sexual orientation discrimination were similar to \ncomplaints of sex or race discrimination.  Because \nthe complaints studied were not necessarily \nsubstantiated through adjudication, though, \nRubenstein’s study—like the survey-based \nstudies—only measured perceived discrimination. \n \nNo similar study has been conducted for the states \nthat currently prohibit gender identity \ndiscrimination.  However, the most recent survey \nof transgender people in San Francisco found that \nalthough 57% of respondents had experienced \nemployment discrimination on the basis of gender \nidentity, only 12% had filed a complaint about the \ndiscrimination they experienced, and of those, only \n3% had filed their complaint with an independent \nagency having the authority to enforce California’s \nanti-discrimination law (Bay Guardian and TLC \n2006). \n   \n \n \n    Raw Data      Population-Adjusted Data\n \n12 \nLGB people file \ncomplaints of \nemployment \ndiscrimination at \nsimilar rates to \nwomen and racial \nminorities \nEvidence of Sexual Orientation Discrimination in Wage Gaps\n \nBackground  \n \nEconomists and sociologists have used survey data \non wages and sexual orientation to look for \nassociations between LGB status and earnings, just \nas they have studied race and sex discrimination.2  \nThe basic idea is that people who have the same \njob and personal characteristics should, on \naverage, be paid the same wage.  Applying this \ntheory, if no discrimination exists, members of two \ndifferent social groups who have the same \ncharacteristics should have the same average pay.  \nIf, after controlling for productive characteristics \n(education, occupation, location, experience, \ntraining, etc.) and other \nrelevant social characteristics \n(marital status, sex, race), \nmembers of one group earn \nless than members of the other \ngroup, then most economists \nand sociologists would conclude \nthat employers are \ndiscriminating against the lower \nearning group.  In addition to \nproviding another perspective on the existence of \ndiscrimination, these studies also allow researchers \nto see whether discrimination translates into \nincome loss and economic hardship. \n \nWage analyses are important but difficult to \nconduct because only a few of the studies that \nsurvey random population samples ask questions \nrelated to sexual orientation.  Those that include \nquestions on income and some measure of sexual \norientation include the National Health and Social \nLife Survey (“NHSLS”), the General Social Survey \n(“GSS”), the United States Census, and the \nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey \n(“NHANES III”). \n \nConducted by the National Opinion Research \nCenter at the University of Chicago, the NHSLS \nquestioned participants in 1993 about their sexual \nattraction, sexual behavior, and sexual identity.  \n                                                 \n2 This section relies on the analysis in M. V. Lee \nBadgett’s “Discrimination Based on Sexual \nOrientation:  A Review of the Literature in Economics \nand Beyond,” in M. V. Lee Badgett and Jefferson \nFrank, eds.  Sexual Orientation Discrimination: An \nInternational Perspective.  London:  Routledge. \n \nThe main drawback of NHSLS is its relatively small \nsample size of 3,432 (Edward O. Laumann et al. \n1994).  Therefore, many studies combine the \nNHSLS with the GSS, also conducted by the  \n \nNational Opinion Research Center has conducted \nsurveys regularly over the past two decades to \nassess the general public’s social and political \nattitudes.  In the late 1980’s, the GSS began \nasking both men and women how many male and \nfemale sex partners they have had since the age of \n18, and for a sub-sample, the sex of their partners \nin the last five years and in the past year.  \n \nOne drawback of both the GSS and NHANES III is \nthat the surveys only ask questions on sexual \nbehavior, not sexual identity.  Using sexual \nbehavior data poses a challenge for interpretation:  \nhow many same-sex partners should be required \nbefore researchers categorize an individual as gay \nor lesbian?  Researchers have taken different \napproaches to this question.  For example, Badgett \nput individuals in the LGB category if they listed at \nleast as many same-sex partners and opposite-sex \npartners since the age of 18 (M.V. Lee Badgett \n1995; M.V. Lee Badgett 2001).  Dan Black et al. \n(2003) ran three sets of analyses, defining LGB \ndifferently each time.  They defined LGB based on \n(1) sexual behavior since age 18, (2) sexual \nbehavior in the past year, and (3) sexual behavior \nin the last five years (Dan Black et al. 2003). \n \nThe Census provides the largest dataset for \nanalyses of wages.  In both the 1990 and 2000 \nCensuses, individuals had the option of indicating \nthat they lived with a same-sex “unmarried \npartner.”  Researchers use that cohabitation status \nas a proxy for LGB sexual orientation. \nPatterns in the Findings \n \nThe studies of sexual orientation’s impact on \nwages reveal different patterns for gay men and \nfor lesbians, as summarized in Table 4.  The \nstudies support the conclusion that sexual \norientation discrimination lowers the wages of gay \nmen.  For lesbians, the findings are less clear, \nsince the differential between lesbian and \nheterosexual women has varied across studies.  \nSome explanations for that variance are considered \nbelow.  One finding regarding lesbians is clear:  \nlesbians consistently earn less than men.  It seems \n \n13 \nGay men earn 10% \nto 32% less than \nsimilarly qualified \nheterosexual men \nthat gender discrimination has a greater impact on \nlesbians’ wages than sexual orientation \ndiscrimination. \n \nNine studies using different datasets consistently \nshow that gay and bisexual men earned 10% to \n32% less than heterosexual men (Sylvia A. \nAllegretto and Michelle M. Arthur 2001; Badgett \n1995; Badgett 2001; Nathan Berg and Donald Lien \n2002; Black et al. 2000; Black et al. 2003; John M. \nBlandford 2003; Suzanne Heller Clain and Karen \nLeppel 2001; Marieka M. Klawitter and Victor Flatt \n1998).  Accounting for differences in occupations \nbetween gay/bisexual men and heterosexual men \ndoes not influence the wage gap much in either \ndirection.3   \n \n                                                 \n \nHowever, a recent study of California data finds a \nsomewhat different pattern.  This study finds that \ngay men in California earn 2% to 3% less than \nheterosexual men (a statistically insignificant \ndifference), and bisexual men \nearn 10% to 15% less than \nheterosexual men (Christopher \nCarpenter 2005).  However, \nthese findings seem to be \nunique to California, as a \nsubsequent study conducted by \nthe same author using NHANES III data, which like \nthe GSS data ask questions about sexual behavior, \nfound a 23%-30% income disadvantage for men \nwho engage in same-sex sexual behavior \n(Carpenter 2007). \n \n \nTable 4:  Employment and Income Data for Gay Men from Wage Analyses Studies \nSurvey  Data Source Wage Differential LGB Definition \nAllegretto & \nArthur (2001) \n1990 U.S. Census (5% \nPUMS) \n14.4% penalty for gay unmarried \npartnered men compared to \nmarried heterosexual men; and \n2.4% penalty compared to \nunmarried partnered heterosexual \nmen. \nMen with male unmarried partners. \nArabshebani  \net al.

Only one \nstudy, limited to the earliest GSS data, finds that \nbeing a lesbian or bisexual woman affects wages \nnegatively, but that wage difference was \nstatistically insignificant (Badgett 1995).  All \nsubsequent studies show that lesbians do not earn \nless than heterosexual women (Arabshebani et al. \n2007; Badgett 2001; Berg and Lien 2002; Black et \nal. 2003; Blandford 2003; Carpenter 2005; Clain \nand Leppel 2001; Klawitter and Flatt 1998).  \nHowever, the studies’ conclusions vary on whether \nlesbians earn more than heterosexual women. \n \nThe studies’ different results seem to depend on \ntheir definitions of lesbianism (Badgett 2001; Black \net al. 2003).  The studies that define sexual \norientation on the basis of recent same-sex \nbehavior (i.e., behavior within the past one to five \nyears) find that lesbians earn more than their \nheterosexual counterparts, while studies of \nbehavior since age 18 find no earnings advantage \nfor lesbians (Black et al. 2003).  Studies using \nCensus data on unmarried \npartners in 1990 show no \nstatistically significant \ndifference between earnings \nof lesbians and heterosexual \nwomen who work full-time \n(Klawitter and Flatt 1998).  \nThe fact that lesbians \ngenerally do not earn less \nthan heterosexual women does not imply the \nabsence of employment discrimination.  First, \nlesbians might make different decisions than \nheterosexual women since they are less likely to \nmarry men—who on average have higher wages—\nor put their careers on hold to have children.  As a \nresult, lesbians might invest in more training or \nactual labor market experience than do \nheterosexual women.  This increase in “human \ncapital” may mask the effects of discrimination.  \nUnfortunately, it is impossible to separate out \nthose effects in existing data.  Second, some \nevidence suggests that women are less likely to \ndisclose their sexual orientation at work (Badgett \n2001).  Thus, the findings above might be different \nhad there been a way to measure these factors for \nlesbians.  With better controls, it is possible that \nwe would see that lesbians earn less than \nheterosexual women with the same actual \nexperience.  \n \nFinally, we note that this kind of statistical method \nhas been used in studies of race and sex \ndiscrimination to see if differences in other \nimportant job outcomes also differ by group \nmembership.  In particular, economists and \nsociologists have analyzed the probability of \nreceiving a promotion, of having a high status \noccupation, of being employed, and of being \nunemployed to see if members of stigmatized \ngroups experience a disadvantage.  To date, we \nknow of only one such study related to sexual \norientation.  In a study using Census 2000 data, \nArabshebani et al. (2007) found that gay men are \nless likely to be employed than heterosexual men \nafter controlling for age, education, race, and \nhealth status, but lesbians are more likely to be \nemployed than are heterosexual women.  \nHowever, the lesbian employment difference \nprobably resulted from choices made by \nheterosexual women to withdraw from the labor \nforce rather than from employers favoring lesbians \nfor jobs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \nTable 5:  Employment and Income Data for Lesbian Women from Wage Analyses Studies \nSurvey  Data Source Wage Differential LGB Definition \nArabshebani \net al.

Klawitter and Flatt (1998) \nused Census data to compare wages of gays and \nlesbians in various jurisdictions—some had sexual \norientation antidiscrimination laws while others did \nnot.  After controlling for individual and location \ncharacteristics, the study found no evidence of a \ndirect relationship between antidiscrimination laws \nand average earnings for people in same-sex \ncouples or on the wage gap between partnered \ngay men and married heterosexual men (Klawitter \nand Flatt 1998). \n \nSince many of the laws had not been in force for \nvery long when the 1990 Census was \nadministered, Klawitter and Flatt’s study does not \nnecessarily mean that antidiscrimination laws have \nno effect.  In addition, the laws’ positive effects \nmay not be quantifiable through wage analyses.  \nFor example, the laws may make it easier for gays \nand lesbians to come out at work, improve intra-\noffice dynamics, or help gays and lesbians to \nachieve a greater sense of dignity. \n \nIncomes of Transgender People \n \nThere have been no published studies to date like \nthose described above analyzing the wage \ndifferences between \ntransgender and non-\ntransgender people.  The most \nsignificant obstacle is the lack \nof available data.  The NHSLS, \nthe GSS, and the United States \nCensus do not ask questions \nabout gender identity, so \nresearchers cannot identify \ntransgender people. \n \nHowever, a number of \nconvenience samples of transgender people, \nincluding some of those summarized in Table 3 \nabove, indicate that large percentages of the \ntransgender population are unemployed and have \nincomes far below the national average. Although \nthese surveys share the limitations described \nabove—overrepresentation of clients of AIDS \nservice organizations, other social service \norganizations, people of color, and commercial sex \nworkers—the studies are consistent in their \nfindings.  In all, between 6% and 60% of \ntransgender people report being unemployed, and \n22% to 64% report incomes of less than $25,000 \nper year (see Table 6).  \n \n17 \nTable 6:  Employment and Income Data from Surveys of Transgender People \nSurvey Year(s) \nData \nCollected  \nSample Unemployment Annual income \nBockting et \nal.

In \ncontrolled experiments, researchers compare \ntreatment of LGB people and treatment of \nheterosexuals by manufacturing scenarios in which \nresearch subjects interact with actual or \nhypothetical people who are coded as gay or \nstraight.  Those interactions are then observed and \nanalyzed for differences.  For instance, in some \nstudies researchers distribute profiles of job \napplicants (including résumés, photographs, and/or \nother materials) to subjects.  Each profile is \ncontrolled to reveal the applicant’s sexual \norientation.  In other words, gay and non-gay \nprofiles are designed to be exactly the same, \nexcept for the labeling of one or more job \napplicants or customers as gay.  Therefore, \nresearchers can be confident that differential \ntreatment is motivated by discrimination.  \nResearchers then compare the rate of interview \noffers and other outcomes that might differ by \nsexual orientation if discrimination occurs. \n \nThis method is used extensively in studies of racial \nhousing discrimination and has been applied more \nfrequently in recent years in studies of racial \nemployment discrimination.  A review of the \nacademic literature found several controlled \nexperiments that assessed differential treatment \non the basis of sexual orientation.  Most of these \nexperiments focus on differential treatment in \nemployment; two studies focused on public \naccommodations. \nStudies of Employment \n \nA survey of the published literature on employment \ndiscrimination found five audited experiments \nwhich showed sexual orientation discrimination; a \nsixth did not.  Because each of the studies were \ncontext-specific, they are difficult to compare. \n \nThe first known audit experiment was conducted \nby Barry Adam (1981), who sent out two nearly \nidentical résumés from fictitious law students to \nOntario law firms.  One résumé was coded as gay \nby stating that the candidate was active in the \n“Gay People’s Alliance.”  The gay-coded candidate  \n \nreceived fewer interview invitations.  \nUnfortunately, Adams did not test for statistical \nsignificance, thus limiting the persuasiveness of his \nreport.  And as discussed later, the measured \ndiscrimination effect may have been skewed by \nbias against social activists. \n \nFollowing Adam’s study, Horvath and Ryan (2003) \nconducted one of the three employment-focused \nexperiments conducted in the United States to \ndate.  They designed résumés for \na technical writer position.  The \nrésumés were then rated by \nundergraduate students—not by \nactual employers.  The \ndemographics of the \nparticipants—77% of the 236 \nparticipants were white women—\nwere also not representative of the undergraduate \npopulation or the larger U.S. population.  The \nstudents rated the heterosexual man the highest \n(84.87 on a 100-point scale), followed by the \nhomosexual woman (80.76), the homosexual man \n(80.38), and then the heterosexual woman (76.2) \n(Horvath and Ryan 2003).  Like the wage studies, \ngay men and lesbians were disadvantaged relative \nto heterosexual men, but lesbians were perceived \nas more qualified than heterosexual women.  The \nsmall advantage for heterosexual men might have \nresulted from the fact that college students show \nless prejudice toward lesbians and gay men than \nthe general population. \n \nAnother study by economist Doris Weichselbaumer \n(2003) found evidence of discrimination against \nAustrian lesbians when compared with \nheterosexual women.  The study sent responses to \njob ads in Austria for four applicants: a feminine \nheterosexual woman, a masculine heterosexual \nwoman, a feminine lesbian, and a masculine \nlesbian.  Conforming to local practice, \nWeichselbaumer included a photograph, school \ntranscript, reference letters, and a résumé for each \napplicant. The femininity or masculinity of the \napplicants was represented in the photographs and \nin hobbies listed in the résumés.  Lesbianism was \nrepresented by a résumé listing of past managerial \nexperience within a gay organization.  Both \nmasculine and feminine lesbians received fewer \ninterview invitations than heterosexuals \n(Weichselbaumer 2003).  There was no statistically \nsignificant difference between the two groups of \n \n19 \nlesbians, suggesting that even feminine lesbians \nexperience discrimination in the labor market. \n \nThe fourth experiment was conducted by Crow, \nFok, and Hartman (1988).  Unlike the previous \nexperiments, this study measured bias but not \nnecessarily discrimination. Managers and \nsupervisors in both private and public sector \nindustries of a southern U.S. city were asked to \nselect six out of eight candidates for a fictitious \naccounting position.  The researchers only gave \nthe subjects information on the candidates’ race, \nsex, and sexual orientation, and the subjects were \ntold that all affirmative action guidelines had been \nfulfilled, leaving them free to discriminate.  In \nother words, this study forced subjects to resort to \nbiases to determine which two candidates to \nexclude.  This experiment found that, regardless of \nsex and race, homosexuals were less likely to be \nselected than heterosexuals (Crow 1988).  In \ncontrast to wage analyses, this experiment showed \nthat white heterosexual women were the most \nlikely to be selected—more likely than white \nhomosexual women and even white heterosexual \nmen. \n \nIn a study published in 2002, Michelle Hebl and \ncolleagues sent eight male and eight female \nundergraduate and graduate students to apply for \njobs at retail stores.  The interactions were taped \nby a concealed recording device.  Half of the time \nthe confederates wore a baseball cap with the \nwords “Gay and Proud”; the other half of the time \nthe same confederates wore caps that read “Texan \nand Proud.”  The researchers analyzed measures \nof “formal discrimination”:  job availability, \npermission to complete a job application, job \ncallbacks, and permission to use the bathroom.  \nThey also analyzed measures of “interpersonal \ndiscrimination”:  interaction duration, number of \nwords spoken during the interaction, negativity \nperceived by the confederates, employer interest \nperceived by the confederates, and employer \nnegativity perceived by reviewers of the recorded \ntapes.  The researchers found that, on average, \nconfederates wearing the gay cap did not suffer \nfrom formal discrimination, perhaps because the \noutcome measures captured only a few measures \navailable at the beginning of the job hiring process.  \nBut the researchers did find that the gay-labeled \napplicants experienced interpersonal \ndiscrimination.  Because all of the stores were in \nthe same mall area of a Texas city, this study’s \nresults may not be indicative of broader \ndiscriminatory patterns (Hebl et al. 2002). \n \nThe sixth study, conducted by Van Hoye and \nLievens (2003) in Belgium, found no significant \nsigns of sexual orientation discrimination.  The \nresearchers distributed candidate profiles to human \nresource professionals in consultancy firms and \ncompanies’ internal human resource departments.  \nThe subjects were given extensive information on \nboth the candidates (personal data, education and \nprofessional experience, and personality) as well as \nan extensive job description (a description of the \ncompany, a car parts manufacturer; the job title, \nHuman Resources Manager; the job contents, \nknowledge, skills, and abilities required; and the \nbenefits offered by the company) (Van Hoye and \nLievens 2003).  The study found that sexual \norientation did not have a significant effect on \nhiring rates.   \n \nThere are some possible explanations why this \nBelgian study found no discrimination, unlike the \nother experimental studies.  Commentators have \nhypothesized that decision-makers are most likely \nto resort to bias and stereotypes when they have \nlimited information regarding the job candidate \nand/or the job opening (Van Hoye and Lievens \n2003; Henry Tosi and Steven Einbender 1985; H. \nKristl Davison and Michael Burke 2000).  Because \nthis study provided its subjects with so much \ninformation—perhaps an unrealistic amount of \ninformation—the subjects may have been less \ninclined to resort to biases than usual.  Another \nexplanation for the apparent lack of discrimination \nis that human resource professionals are not \nrepresentative of other people who make \ninterviewing and hiring decisions, for example \nhiring managers, and human resource managers \nmight be particularly attuned to laws forbidding \ndiscrimination.  Similarly, the fictitious job opening \nwas in the field of human resources, which again, \nmay not be representative of other fields.  Finally, \nthe geographic location—Belgium—may be \nparticularly hospitable to gay people; after all, \nBelgium was the second country to legalize same-\nsex marriage. \nStudies of Public Accommodations  \n \nIn a study published in 1996, Walters and Curran \nsent three couples—male/male, female/female, \nand female/male—and an observer to 20 retail \nstores in an indoor mall (1996).  All couples \nfollowed the same script, which directed them to \nhold hands, smile at each other, and request help \nfrom sales staff, etc.  The couples and the \nobserver found that, on average, retail staff waited \n \n20 \nlonger before helping female/female (4 min. 18 \nsec.) and male/male (3 min. 51 sec.) couples, \ncompared to female/male couples (1 min. 22 sec.) \n(Walter and Curran 1996).  In addition, retail staff \ntalked about the same-sex couples and subjected \nthem to staring, pointing, laughter, and rudeness.  \nWhen same-sex couples interacted with staff, the \nabove signals of negative feelings emerged 10% to \n75% of the time (staff were rude to female/female \ncouples 10% of the time; staff stared at male/male \ncouples 75% of the time) (Walter and Curran \n1996).  None of the male/female couples were \nsubjected to any of those negative signals.   \n \nIn a second study, Jones (1996) took the auditing \nmethodology and applied it to another public \naccommodations context.  He sent letters to 320 \nhotels around the country.  The letters were signed \nby either a same-sex couple or an opposite-sex \ncouple, who requested a room with one bed.  \nJones found that same-sex couples received less \npositive responses than opposite-sex couples; the \ndifference was statistically significant (Jones 1996). \nIssues Related to Interpretation of \nResults \n \nWhile well-designed experiments have provided \nconvincing evidence of differential treatment of \nLGB as compared with heterosexuals, controlled \nexperiments also have some limitations.  They are \ngenerally limited to a single context (such as entry-\nlevel jobs or retail interactions) or geographic \nlocation.  They do not work well for studying \ndiscrimination in some important contexts, such as \naccess to high status jobs that involve internal \nhiring processes or the presence of relatively rare \nskills or experience.   \n \nFurthermore, designing controlled experiments can \nbe difficult.  One particular challenge is \ndetermining how to code the confederates’ sexual \norientation.  Researchers use certain traits to code \nconfederates as either LGB or heterosexual.  \nHowever, those traits may be coded for more than \njust sexual orientation.  For example, a researcher \nmay choose to code a confederate as gay by \nhaving him wear a pin reading “gay and proud.”  \nHowever, that pin may actually also indicate \npolitical activism as well as sexual orientation, and \nsome subjects may discriminate on the basis of \npolitical activism.   \n \nTherefore, the experimental studies provide \nconvincing evidence that sexual orientation \ndiscrimination exists, but we cannot use these \nstudies to predict the likelihood of discrimination in \nother contexts. \n \n21 \nConclusions \n \nOverall, the existing research on sexual orientation discrimination provides consistent and compelling evidence \nthat discrimination against LGBT people exists: \n \n• LGBT individuals have reported experiences of discrimination based on their own sexual orientation and \ngender identity, both to researchers and, in some cases, to enforcement agencies charged with \ninvestigating claims of discrimination. \n• Heterosexual people have reported observing discrimination based on sexual orientation. \n• Wages of gay men are lower than wages of heterosexual men with the same personal and job \ncharacteristics.   \n• The best available data suggests that transgender people experience very high unemployment rates and \nthat large percentages have very low incomes.  \n• Employers, sales clerks, and other observers have treated LGB job applicants or customers differently \nfrom heterosexuals.   \n \nThe wage studies and experiments also demonstrate that discrimination is not benign.  Lower incomes and \ndifficulty in getting or keeping a job create direct disadvantages for LGBT people who have experienced \ndiscrimination in the workplace.  \n \n \n \n22 \nReferences \n \nAdam, Barry D.  1981.  “Stigma and Employability: Discrimination by Sex and Sexual Orientation in the Ontario \nLegal Profession.” The Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology 18(2): 216-221. \n \nAllegretto, Sylvia A. and Michelle M.

    "abstract": "Executive Summary Over the last ten years, many researchers have conducted studies to find out whether lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (&quot;LGBT&quot;) people face sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. These studies include surveys of LGBT individuals&apos; workplace experiences, wage comparisons between LGB and heterosexual persons, analyses of discrimination complaints filed with administrative agencies, and testing studies and controlled experiments. This report summarizes findings from these studies. When surveyed, 16% to 68% of LGBT people report experiencing employment discrimination. Studies conducted from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s revealed that 16% to 68% of LGB respondents reported experiencing employment discrimination at some point in their lives. Since the mid-1990s, an additional fifteen studies found that 15% to 43% of LGB respondents experienced discrimination in the workplace. When asked more specific questions about the type of discrimination experienced, LGB respondents reported the following experiences that were related to their sexual orientation: 8%-17% were fired or denied employment, 10%-28% were denied a promotion or given negative performance evaluations, 7%-41% were verbally/physically abused or had their workplace vandalized, and 10%-19% reported receiving unequal pay or benefits. Fifteen to 57% of transgender people also report experiencing employment discrimination. When transgender individuals were surveyed separately, they reported similar or higher levels of employment discrimination. In six studies conducted between 1996 and 2006, 20% to 57% of transgender respondents reported having experienced employment discrimination at some point in their life. More specifically, 13%-56% were fired, 13%-47% were denied employment, 22%-31% were harassed, and 19% were denied a promotion based on their gender identity. When surveyed, many heterosexual co-workers report witnessing sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. A small number of researchers have also asked heterosexuals whether they have witnessed discrimination against their LGB peers. These studies revealed that 12% to 30% of respondents in certain occupations, such as the legal profession, have witnessed antigay discrimination in employment. In states that currently prohibit sexual orientation discrimination, LGB people file complaints of employment discrimination at similar rates to women and racial minorities. Individual complaints of discrimination filed with government agencies provide another measure of perceived discrimination. The General Accounting Office (or &quot;GAO&quot;, now known as the Government Accountability Office) collected the number of complaints filed in states that outlaw sexual orientation discrimination and found that 1% of all discrimination complaints related to sexual orientation. However, comparisons of data from ten states show that the rate of sexual orientation discrimination complaints per GLB person is 3 per 10,000, which is roughly equivalent to gender-based discrimination complaints. Gender v. Sexual Orientation Raw Data Population-Adjusted Data Gay men earn 10% to 32% less than similarly qualified heterosexual men. A wage or income gap between LGB people and heterosexual people with the same job and personal characteristics provides another indicator of sexual orientation discrimination. A growing number of studies using data from the National Health and Social Life Survey (&quot;NHSLS&quot;), the General Social Survey (&quot;GSS&quot;), the United States Census, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (&quot;NHANES III&quot;) show that gay men earn 10% to 32% less than otherwise similar heterosexual men. The findings for lesbians, however, are less clear. In some studies they earn more than heterosexual women but less than heterosexual or gay men. Transgender people report high rates of unemployment and very low earnings. While no detailed wage and income analyses of the transgender population have been conducted to date, convenience samples of the transgender population find that 6%-60% of respondents report being unemployed, and 22-64% of the employed population earns less than $25,000 per year. Controlled experiments reveal sexual orientation discrimination in workplace settings. In controlled experiments, researchers manufacture scenarios that allow comparisons of the treatment of LGB people with treatment of heterosexuals. Seven out of eight studies using controlled experiments related to employment and public accommodation find evidence of sexual orientation discrimination. Despite the variations in methodology, context, and time period in the studies reviewed in this report, our review of the evidence demonstrates one disturbing and consistent pattern: sexual orientation-based and gender identity discrimination is a common occurrence in many workplaces across the country.   Bias in the Workplace: Consistent Evidence of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Discrimination Over the last ten years, academic researchers in economics, sociology, psychology, and other social sciences have conducted research to find out whether lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (&quot;LGBT&quot;) people face employment discrimination. Government and community organizations have also conducted such research. With increasing frequency, policymakers at the federal, state, and local level are considering the rates of employment discrimination as they consider laws that would ban employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In this report we summarize the findings of research about employment discrimination against LGBT people from four different kinds of studies. Surveys of LGBT people&apos;s experiences with workplace discrimination These studies routinely show that considerable numbers of LGBT people believe they have been discriminated against in the workplace. These studies also show that heterosexuals perceive discrimination against their LGB peers. Because these studies tend to focus on particular occupations, population groups, or geographic areas, the rates of perceived discrimination vary considerably across their findings. Analyses of employment discrimination complaints filed with government agencies Thus far, there has been one published study on the number of sexual orientation discrimination complaints filed with government agencies. Although the raw number of complaints is small, the rate of complaints per 10,000 LGB people is comparable to the rate of sex discrimination complaints per 10,000 women. Analyses of wage differentials between LGBT and heterosexual persons Employment discrimination often translates into lower earnings. Wage analyses consistently show that gay men earn 10% to 32% less than heterosexual men. The findings on lesbians&apos; earnings are less consistent. While less data is available about the incomes of transgender people in comparison with non-transgender people, a number of surveys have found high unemployment rates and low income levels for transgender people. Controlled experiments A new and expanding line of research involves experiments that control conditions to test whether LGB people experience differences in treatment when compared with identical heterosexual people. These studies find that LGB and heterosexual persons are subject to disparate treatment. The remainder of this report describes the studies&apos; methods and findings. The methodologies used and contexts studied vary considerably and limit our ability to generalize findings to all locations, occupations, or economic contexts. Also, the limitations of the methods mean that we cannot say how likely a LGBT person would be to experience employment discrimination. Despite these caveats, the review does demonstrate a consistent pattern: there is ample evidence that sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination against LGBT people occurs in many workplaces across the country",
