All the universities have opportunities to pro-mote their best talents, but this is the time to refresh them and tell our story in a contemporary way.”The University has had promotional opportunities in the past, including the dedication of the plaza of the Jesse H. Jones Commu-nication Center to former student Walter Cronkite in 2012 and placing ad-vertisements around cam-pus of featured alumni, Susswein said.“This is not TOWER page 2STATELegislative experts explain bill deliberationBy Mikaela Cannizzo@mikaelac16Relocation of Madam Mam’s set for NuecesBy Hannah Daniel@hannnahdanielThe original Madam Mam’s, a Thai restaurant on Guadalupe Street, is relocating to 26th and Nueces streets af-ter about 15 years at its current location.The new location is ex-pected to open by the end of February and will fea-ture several additions such as an outdoor patio, alco-hol service and free Wi-Fi. Restaurant manager May Chiravisit said the at-mosphere of the new loca-tion will be similar to that of a sports bar. Custom-ers will be able to watch games on televisions while drinking tap beer, Chiravisit said.Tanapong Hanwong, restaurant owner and Madam Mam’s son, said some menu items will be replaced with dishes more suitable for college students, such as Thai chicken wings. Jacob King, inter-national relations and global studies freshman, said he’s been eating at Madam Mam’s since he was a child but is look-ing forward to seeing new features added to the restaurant. “The idea of a Mad-am Mam’s geared toward college students is pretty cool,” King said. “I’ve been trying to find a cool place to watch games, so I’d be totally open to checking it out.”The new spot will be about a tenth of a mile away from the existing loca-tion, replacing Good Juju Cafe in the GrandMarc apartment complex.Illustration by Geo Casillas | Daily Texan StaffLEGE page 2 MADAM page 2Dell Medical filmmaker debuts new documentary.

Dawnna Dukes A grand jury indict-ed state Rep. Dawnna Dukes, D-Austin, over misuse of legislative mon-ey and staff Tuesday, ac-cording to the Austin American-Statesman.Dukes is indicted on 13 felony charges of tampering with public records and two misdemeanors of abusing official capacity, the States-man reported Wednesday.Dukes is charged with one misdemeanor for using legislative staff for personal means, and the Statesman said Dukes gave a staffer a raise so they could have gas money to drive Dukes’ daughter to school.The other misdemean-or is for using her cam-paign contributions for her nonprofit event, the Afri-can-American Community Heritage Festival. The event prompted an investigation by Texas Rangers after her staff said they were worked full-time for it, according to the Statesman.The 13 felony charges are for receiving pay by the state even though she had not traveled to the Capitol to do business, according to the Statesman. Legislators can be paid while the Legislature is not in session if they go to the Capitol for business, but Dukes is charged with re-questing pay for times she did not do so.DUKES page 2Joshua Guerra | Daily Texan StaffThe Tower was lit Wednesday evening for an advertisement for the University promoting their best talents.City Council member Jimmy Flannigan of District 6, who is the first openly gay man elected to the Council, led Wednesday’s meeting to create an LGBTQ Quality of Life Commission to improve the communi-ty’s safety and representation in Austin.At the Asian-American Re-source Center, poster boards were marked with LGBTQ issues such as homeless trans-gender youth, lack of legal protection and potential school policies.“My hope, certainly with to-night’s meeting, is that we have conversation not just [from] what one white, cisgender guy thinks is important or are pri-orities for the community,” Flannigan said.Senate Bill 242, proposed by state Sen. Konni Burton, R-Colleyville, would require school districts to give parents any information regarding their physical, emotional or psychological health. “It’s ridiculous that we are asking professionals to ‘out’ children, basically,” said Awais Azher, UT alumnus at the event. “A lot of people are afraid of coming out to their family, not just for relationship rea-sons, but because they can ac-tually end up being homeless.”In October, Austin Mayor Steve Adler announced the creation of an LGBTQ com-mission during a forum where the parents of an anti-gay hate crime victim asked Aus-tin elected officials to protect LGBTQ individuals through policies and public safety.In 2015, Austin enacted an ordinance requiring business-es with individual-use public restrooms that lock to have signage designating they are gender neutral.UT graduate Jae Lin said he has complained to the city about businesses without the proper signage, but his com-plaints were ignored.“I have done that for multi-ple businesses around town,” Lin said. “I have called in and also have used the 311 app to file the report … and those are dismissed immediately.”Flannigan told Lin to call him if the complaints are MUSIC page 2The Texas State Legisla-ture, which began its 85th session Jan. 10, faces the deliberation of more than 1,700 bills throughout the next five months.  Every other year, Tex-as legislators in both the House of Representatives and the Senate convene at the Capitol for a 140-day legislative session in which they review bills and convert a small fraction of those bills into laws.Sherri Greenberg, clini-cal professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Pub-lic Affairs, said the major-ity of bills fail to become laws because of a myriad of factors including ex-penses and lack of support from legislators.“The whole system is set up to kill bills,” Green-berg said. “It’s much easi-er to kill a bill than to pass a bill.”Bills can be drafted by anyone, but a legislator in ei-ther chamber of government By Lisa Dreher@lisa_dreher97By Lisa Dreher@lisa_dreher97Angel Ulloa | Daily Texan StaffCity Council member Jimmy Flannigan held a meeting Wednesday to present the creation of an LGBTQ Commission.

It’s big … and it’s not messing around.’”Health and society sophomore Aleeya Ali said she thinks the Tower is the heart of campus because you can see it from many different parts of Austin.“It’s what defines the cam-pus,” Ali said. “Whenever there is something special that happens like a celebration or something, it just lights up and celebrates it and it’s a memory.”Ali said it’s the little things about the Tower that make students feel like they’re a part of campus.“I’m from Pakistan, and I remember there was this one attack in Pakistan the semester [before last],” Ali said. “[The next day, UT] was playing the national anthem of Pakistan. It was so cool.”According to the UT main website, there are six different lighting configurations that can be seen on the Tower walls as part of the lighting system originally designed by Carl J. Eckhardt Jr in the 1940s.TOWER continues from page 1A $5 million endowment to promote American music will allow the Butler School of Mu-sic to better educate students in the study, performance and composition of music pro-duced in the Americas, ranging from jazz to mariachi. The endowment will per-mit Butler ensembles that per-form primarily music from the Americas to tour more and support the Center for Ameri-can Music in bringing scholars, performers and composers to campus, said Butler School di-rector Mary Ellen Poole.“The composers and per-formers and scholars we’re training here at UT will shape its future, which is a huge responsibility,” Poole said. “Therefore, it’s our responsi-bility to use this wonderful gift wisely, with as much impact as possible.”The endowment was left after the death of Richard Business freshman Neha Shah said she fre-quents Madam Mam’s with friends and doesn’t think the relocation will affect the amount of business the restaurant will receive.“I think it’s really pop-ular, so people are go-ing to go anyway,” Shah said. “It’s not really that far.”The new restaurant provides a larger space, seating about 30 more customers than the existing location.Kismet Cafe, another long-standing West Cam-pus eatery, recently left the area for a larger space away from campus.Michael Lam, arts and entertainment technolo-gies sophomore, said he’s relieved the new Madam Mam’s location is still in West Campus.“Every time I’ve gone there … it’s always re-ally good,” Lam said. “Having a relocation isn’t too much of an incon-venience. I’d probably be more concerned if they were moving away from campus.”Chiravisit said she hopes the new location will be a good environ-ment for students to hang out.“It’s going to be fun, and a challenge for us,” Chiravisit said. “We’ve been here doing the same thing for fifteen years, but we want to find something new.“MADAM continues from page 1LEGE continues from page 1must sponsor and introduce a bill for consideration. During this session, bill fil-ing began Nov. 14 and will end March 10.A bill is first introduced in the House of Represen-tatives, led by Speaker Joe Straus, or the Senate, led by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. After a bill is introduced, it is usually assigned to a committee that represents the subject matter of each specific bill.While the majority of bills do not move past com-mittee action, the ones that do are typically amended by committee members be-fore proceeding to the full House or Senate. In this stage, a final passage vote is taken, and if the bill re-ceives a simple majority vote, it is sent to the op-posite chamber to undergo the process again.At this point, only bills that receive a majority of votes from both the full House and full Senate are still eligible to become laws. Following the pas-sage through the opposite chamber, bills with major-ity votes are moved back to where they originated. If no amendments were add-ed by the other chamber, the bill is typically enrolled and sent to the governor, who has 10 days to either veto the bill or allow it to become a law through sig-nature or no action.According to the Leg-islative Reference Library of Texas, the 84th ses-sion consisted of 6,276 House and Senate bills filed, out of which 1,323 sent to the governor, 355 signed by the governor, 4 vetoed by the governor and 20 filed without the governor’s signature.According to the Texas Constitution, laws passed by the Legislature typical-ly go into effect at least 90 days after the session con-cludes, which is scheduled for May 29 this year.Senate Bill 1, or the state budget, is the only bill re-quired to pass. According to The Texas Tribune, the budget is limited this ses-sion because of a decrease in oil and gas tax income. Saul Cornejo Bravo, an economics junior and a Capitol intern, said he be-lieves the legislative pro-cess works well but would change the frequency of sessions in the state to once a year instead of every oth-er year in order to make a yearly budget.“It’s so hard for them to predict what the revenues [will] be two years out and [a session every other year] makes it harder for them to make these predictions and to stay on budget,” Cornejo Bravo said.Bills can be tracked throughout the session on Texas Legislature Online.LGBTQ continues from page 1ignored again.“When you feel the city has failed you, make my call the second call you make,” Flannigan said.UT graduate students Dan-iel Jimenez and Cassie Gi-anni, co-chairs of Pride Policy at UT’s Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, said queer cooperative housing on campus would make students more comfortable in their living spaces.“One of [Graduate Stu-dent Assembly’s] issues was to make housing more available and more affordable,” Jimenez said. “So when I heard they were talking about the idea of a queer co-op for graduate hous-ing … I feel like there’s a way to tackle that.”Gianni said transgender students sometimes feel un-comfortable with assigned roommates based on the sex reflected on their birth certifi-cate and said the single rooms they had to choose from were often expensive and hard to find.“It’s very binary, very gen-dered with who you can room with,” Gianni said. “In my undergrad [year], oftentimes they were forced to be in the single rooms because that was the only place that they could temporarily live.”In 2015, there were 22 hate crimes reported in Travis County, according to the Aus-tin American-Statesman.Last year, the Austin Police Department joined LGBT ad-vocacy organization Equality Texas to prevent hate crimes by training officers on how to respond to domestic violence in LGBT relationships.In October, Austin, along with Dallas and Fort Worth, received a perfect score for LGBT-friendliness, accord-ing to the Human Rights Campaign’s Municipal Equality Index.A lot of people are afraid of coming out to their family, not just for relationship rea-sons, but because they can actually end up being homeless.— Awais Azher, UT alumnusName: 5374/Rice Jones Graduate School; Width: 60p0; Depth: 10 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: 5374W&N 3NEWS Thursday, January 19, 2017 3CAMPUS CAMPUSThe Dell Medical School’s Health Disparities Team partnered with Hus-ton-Tillotson University to screen a pilot episode of a docu-series on sur-viving sexual abuse and domestic violence. The pilot episode of the docu-series, “Our Jour-ney Alive,” was debuted at Huston-Tillotson and follows the lives of do-mestic violence and sexual abuse survivors in Austin and Waco. “My main inspiration for creating this docu-reality series was, as a survivor myself, we rarely see survi-vors portrayed in any type of television unless it’s kind of sensationalized, unless it was a major case or a celeb-rity that you hear about,” said Sophia Strother, the series creator, writer and director. “But as a survivor I want to see others like my-self that have thrived after the incident.”The Dell Medical School and Huston-Tillotson University have been in a partnership for about a year and a half in or-der to provide health ser-vices to underserved res-idents in East Austin and Travis County. “It’s a very important top-ic, and it’s one that we see when we think of health disparities,” said Virginia Brown, director of health disparities at the Dell Med-ical School. “So it’s really important to be able to get to young people, to engage them in this kind of con-versation and help them understand what healthy relationships are all about and how to get there.”According to Strother, 10 million men and wom-en in the U.S. are affected by abuse each year. Stroth-er wanted to create this series to promote aware-ness on the hard reality survivors have to face after the abuse. “We really wanted to portray that survivors come from all walks of life,” Strother said. “You can be rich or poor, no matter what nationality, it happens to everyone, men, women alike. So we real-ly just wanted to have an outlet where we could por-tray that honesty and … show different things that can be therapeutic in your everyday life.” Carolyn Thomas, a domestic violence sur-vivor and one of the cast members of “Our Journey Alive,” said as a survivor she wants people to know there are ways of getting through abuse. “The reason why I joined Sophia on our ‘Our Journey Alive’ is get the message out that you can move forward after [going through] domes-tic violence,” Thomas said. “It’s really important for me to … try to save lives and get them out of these relationships.”By Anusha Lalani@anusha_lalaniChase Karacostas | Daily Texan StaffSophia Strother, creator of the docu-series “Our Journey Alive” answers questions follow-ing a screening of the first episode of the show.

Dukes told KVUE her constituents persuaded her to return.“Everyone kept saying, ‘Dawnna, you need to be back, and you know in your heart you want to,’” Dukes told KVUE.Last week, Moore met with Texas Rangers over wheth-er to seek an indictment against Dukes.Last Monday, Dukes con-firmed to the Texas Tribune in an email that she will be pres-ent when the session gaveled in, but potential replacements vying for House District 46 in case of a special election said they will keep campaigning.Cole’s Democratic oppo-nent Jose “Chito” Vela III kicked off his campaign re-cently, and Vela still urged Dukes to resign.“Given her absence during the previous session, her ongoing health problems and her pending criminal chargers, it is doubtful that Rep. Dukes can continue to effectively represent the peo-ple of House District 46,” Vela said in a press release. “I re-new my call for Rep. Dukes to immediately resign her position.”A $5 million endowment to promote American music will allow the Butler School of Mu-sic to better educate students in the study, performance and composition of music pro-duced in the Americas, ranging from jazz to mariachi. The endowment will per-mit Butler ensembles that per-form primarily music from the Americas to tour more and support the Center for Ameri-can Music in bringing scholars, performers and composers to campus, said Butler School di-rector Mary Ellen Poole.“The composers and per-formers and scholars we’re training here at UT will shape its future, which is a huge responsibility,” Poole said. “Therefore, it’s our responsi-bility to use this wonderful gift wisely, with as much impact as possible.”The endowment was left after the death of Richard Rainwater in September 2015 and is expected to provide $250,000 annually beginning in the next fiscal year.  Rainwater, a 1966 UT math-ematics alumnus and Forth Worth investor, began work-ing with former Butler direc-tor Glenn Chandler in 2001 to plan his gift. Poole said she is most excit-ed about the Rainwater Inno-vation Grants, a new program that will give funding directly to graduate and undergraduate students for projects which aim to promote and advance the arts. This competitive program, which could tentatively begin this spring, will be a chance for students to present inno-vative proposals to faculty in the school. Composition professor Dan Welcher said traditionally clas-sical music only includes Euro-pean music. However, he said he believes American music should be a primary source of study for music students.“Our students grow up in a multicultural musical mix of styles, nationalities and tastes,” Welcher said. “It makes great sense for our students to dig deeper into their own roots, and it gives me great profession-al pride to know that UT will now be a beacon for this sort of study.”Music composition junior Donald Hale said he could see the endowment going toward a number of diverse projects at the Butler School, including new scholarships and fellow-ships as well as opportunities to bring American music to diverse communities around the world. “With this funding, pro-fessors could bring world renowned musicians and composers at the forefronts of their fields to give lec-tures and master classes for the benefit of our stu-dent populace,” Hale said. “I’m very excited for what this would mean for the future of our wonderful music program.”By Claire Allbright@claireallbrightAlumnus leaves Butler School of Music $5 million endowmentDUKES continues from page 1Dell Medical School screens docu-series on surviving abuse Given her absence during the previous session, her ongoing health problems … it is doubtful that Rep. Dukes can continue to … represent the people of House District 46.— Jose “Chito” Vela III, Democratic candidateOn Dec. 15, senior Newsweek writer Kurt Eichenwald went on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show to debate a bombshell dis-covery that Eichenwald had made about Donald Trump being admitted to a mental institution in the 90s. Carlson, a conserva-tive television staple, is a 47-year-old man that wears a bow tie and is best known for getting demolished by guest Jon Stewart on his old show “Crossfire” — hardly an intimidating opponent. Defying all odds, Eichenwald somehow managed to make Carlson look good in one of the most bi-zarre interviews I’ve ever seen. Instead of offering evidence for his Trump claim, Eichenwald brought a giant binder of “Tucker Carlson falsehoods” on the show and deflected any question about his own claims about Trump with a different attack on Carlson. When he finally did talk about his claim about Trump, he claimed that it was intended to be a coded signal for one of his sources. Instead of talking about the many legitimately concerning problems with Trump, Eichenwald pursued a fake news story.With the rise of fake news and the alt-right and the emergence of sites like Breit-bart into the mainstream, it’s easy to think that the only threats to journalism are com-ing from the right. However, easy to miss thanks to the rise of modern Nazis and the new administration’s threats to human rights is how awful liberal journalists and pundits have become.Not to be outdone by Eichenwald’s aw-fulness, Silicon Valley CEO Melinda Byer-ley wrote a self-serving political message on Twitter that showed how out of touch some liberals really are. In an open letter to Middle America, Byerley wrote that they only have themselves to blame for their declining economic situation, and that in order to get back on track, they must cater to people like her by adding fiber internet and “commit to not being bigots.” I don’t claim to be in touch with rural America, but I suspect that this open letter wouldn’t resonate that well with the people it was supposedly directed at.Eichenwald and Byerley might have had elite bad takes, but no Twitter user has churned out terrible opinions more consistently than Eric Garland. Garland became famous shortly after the election, when he got high on Adderall and wrote an enormous (127 tweets), slightly intel-ligible tweetstorm attempting to explain why Obama and Clinton weren’t resist-ing Trump by using game theory. In this tweetstorm, he lays out why Ed Snowden and Chelsea Manning are Russian oper-atives and states his willingness to die to resist Russia. Game theory is never really invoked and we never learn why Obama and Clinton “just gave up,” but that didn’t stop numerous liberals from fawning over Garland’s verbal diarrhea. Mother Jones editor Clara Jeffery called Garland’s tweet-storm “a federalist paper for 2016.”That the opinions of these people are viewed as legitimate by many mainstream liberals is worrying to say the least. If liberals want to be the gatekeepers of legitimate journalism, they cannot validate the views of those that have proven themselves to be detached from reality.Chastain-Howley is a rhetoric and writ-ing junior from Dallas.4 OPINION4ALEXANDER CHASE, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF | @TexanEditorialThursday, January 19, 2017LEGALESE | Opinions expressed in The Daily Texan are those of the editor, the Editorial Board or the writer of the article.

With the many distractions inherent in our culture, it is easy to absorb mindless entertainment and false information. The latter is far more damaging, as it can lead to adults who as-sume the information they grew up on is always accurate. This is where Bill Nye the Science Guy came in on Sept. 10, 1993. His background in science and comedy birthed a show that educated a generation, and his return this year is anticipated by fans and newcomers alike.“Bill Nye Saves the World” has a gen-eral premiere date, though no specifics have been released. Millennials all over the country wait with bated breath for the return of their first science teacher this spring. The excellent timing of this show’s release cannot be overstated. Though the past few years have seen increasing sup-port for STEM fields from top government officials — including President Obama — there is fear among the science community that the incoming administration has less interest in encouraging young people to en-ter STEM fields.On top of concerns about Betsy De-Vos’ religious motivations and support of voucher programs and charter schools, the nationwide attention to political leaders and giants of industry has spurred a new age of misinformation. Due to the attention paid to respected officials, there is a need for someone to separate fact from fiction. Bill Nye plans to let his show fill this crucial role. Each episode will tackle a different sci-entific topic, often specifically focused on dispelling rumors or anti-scientific claims.Professor Lawrence Abraham, co-direc-tor of the UTeach Natural Science Program, said that educational programming can be very helpful for young children.“Educational programming can expand children’s experiences to include both cultural settings they would not ordinarily see or un-derstand and also physical places, things and happenings that are not within the part of the world in which they live.” Abraham said. A fan of Bill Nye himself, Abraham said that his own early education relied heavily on televised instructors.“From second grade through twelfth grade I had both TV teachers and classroom teach-ers for almost every subject,” Abraham said. “I think this initiative provided me with great early learning experiences, before today’s versions of children’s educational television, which helped develop some critical think-ing skills as well provided exposure to social, cultural and scientific ideas and ways of un-derstanding the world that I would not have otherwise had.” At the moment, grown millennials may well be the most excited for the return of our favorite televised scientist, but let us not forget that this program is aimed at those much younger. Just as he inspired us to think critically and approach problems differently as we grew, Bill Nye has returned to educate the next generation.The support that the science community has gotten from President Obama and his administration is likely to diminish over the next four years, making Nye and those like him all the more important. In this age of misinformation, it is up to all of us to check facts and sources. With Nye at our backs combating science falsehoods, that job just got a bit easier.Bonfiglio is a journalism junior from Oak Creek, Colorado.

By The Daily Texan Editorial Board @TexanEditorial I don’t claim to be in touch with rural America, but I suspect that this open letter wouldn’t resonate that well with the people it was suppos-edly directed at.Infographic by Kelly Smith | Daily Texan file infographicOn Tuesday, as the semester began, so too did the filing period to run for a po-sition in Student Government, as well as in a host of other organizations. Between now and Feb. 14, every student on campus, regardless of previous experience, will be able to file to run to represent their peers.Last year’s controversial election period inspired us to ask the student body to join us in pressuring SG to reform itself — to run ethical campaigns, promise important and achievable goals and then make good on those promises once elected. Daniel Chapman and Austin James Robinson’s campaigns, in particular, asked students to question whether SG should exist at all. While this year’s assembly deserves more time for the student body to make any de-cisions on that front, now is the time to consider what it is SG should be, before the next round of candidates for executive alliance color our views.Like us, SG acts as a voice for change on campus that represents the students them-selves. At its core, SG is able to place stu-dents in positions across dozens of boards and committees to advocate for solutions to many problems across our campus, and can spend some money to directly address those problems as well. While its resolu-tions and bills are its most apparent ac-complishments, it is that behind the scenes work that perhaps matters most. In order for them to best serve us, we need people to run for its top positions who are aware of pre-existing problems, and equipped to handle the unexpected.Since 2009, when the Student Govern-ment election code was revised to elimi-nate ‘tickets’ that were similar to political parties, 7 of 8 presidents have been men and most of those have been white. In that time period, the VP position has been filled with a diverse group of students — but the race and gender trends of the two offices’ holders over these past eight years at the very least gives potential candidates reason to believe that how they look will determine their success when they run. And at a university where lip service to progressive causes is a requirement to win, that is wholly unacceptable.This isn’t to say that Kevin Helgren and Binna Kim have been ill-equipped to do their jobs. Helgren’s experiences as a gay man with Tourette’s have manifested themselves in an administration that has taken great steps to be inclusive and have spent significant time working on mental health issues. But while his administration has been on the side of students of color in the affirmative action fight, Helgren was not in the strongest position to lead a campus discussion on race following the Young Conservatives of Texas bake sale.Moments like these should lead us to question whether we might have missed out on people who could have been bet-ter equipped to handle some of the most difficult situations we’ve faced. While it’s great that this abundance of white guys has supported initiatives that aimed to address problems like sexual assault on campus, we’ve missed out on having women lead this conversation and have the power to im-plement their own approach. And whatever the cause, that deserves to change. Our campus is overflowing with tal-ented, ambitious and driven individuals — and they certainly aren’t all white men. The consistent message that our executive alliances only look a specific way means that we’re missing out on all of the quali-fied women and people of color who could do the job. Our University deserves the best qual-ified and most capable person to hold its most powerful student office. To women, to students of color, to people who identify as part of the LGBT community, to differ-ently abled Longhorns — if you feel you have the capability to represent the stu-dent body, run at the top of the ticket.McAvoy balances the charac-ter’s more outlandish and ham-my aspects with fine-tuned vulnerability. It’s clear Kevin doesn’t want to go down this dark path, but his villainous side grows stronger in spite of his efforts to control it.Recognizing the conflict within Kevin, Casey attempts to turn his personalities against each other. What ensues is a cat-and-mouse game where both characters find themselves at wits’ end, and they discover they have a lot more in com-mon than they initially realize. Like Kevin, Casey is an outsid-er, and Taylor-Joy subtly con-veys the same pain in her dis-tant gaze as McAvoy’s. Casey’s flashbacks to a childhood hunting trip inform her ac-tions against Kevin, and as their face-off reaches its climax, “Split” hits some unexpectedly emotional notes. The film benefits from ex-cellent camerawork from Mike Gioulakis, the director of pho-tography of “It Follows.” He carries over that film’s crisp look and drawn-out shots to “Split” with great effect, lin-gering on the more horrifying moments and letting them play out. The music by West Dylan Thordson is similarly spare, al-lowing the actors and writing to evoke the dread Shyamalan aims for.“Split” succeeds on its un-willingness to take itself se-riously. The occasionally clunky dialogue, ridiculous portrayal of mental illness and long moments of exposition may be distracting, but they are also largely forgivable because the film just wants to have fun. Shyamalan takes “Split” to ri-diculous heights that seem to require a leap of faith on the part of audiences. Join him, and your questions will be answered by the end in one fell swoop. SPLITRunning Time: 1 h 57 min Rating: PG-13Score:After losing his uncle, graduate student Bucky Mill-er sifted through photos his uncle took over his lifetime and held each photograph in his hand. Having the physical photographs not only helped him cope with his loss, but also reaffirmed his love for film photography.“Just having them, going through them and picking out favorites meant a lot to me,” Miller said. “I feel like there is an emotional attachment that we can have with a physical ob-ject that we really lose out on if everything is on Facebook.” Film photography uses a thin piece of plastic “film” coated with light-sensitive chemicals that capture light. Despite the popularity of digital photog-raphy, some photographers are still allured by film be-cause of its visual aesthetic and physical qualities. “You can get prints made, but people don’t really make them anymore,” Miller said. “People are getting exhausted from digi-tal, and they are wanting to hold photographs again. After going through my uncle’s photos, I thought to myself, ‘I should real-ly be printing more of my pho-tos for later in my life.’” For Miller — who was in-spired not only by his photog-rapher uncle but also by his mother, who frequently pho-tographed family moments with film — the preservation of film is personal. But he isn’t the only one who still has deep feelings about film. In the past two years, sales of 35 mm film have increased by 5 percent. “I don’t think film has ever really gone away,” Miller said.Miller said film can be used as an important tool to help photographers develop their craft because learning a stripped-down and more te-dious process can make the transition to digital easier in the long run.“People starting out in pho-tography should really start with film,” Miller said. “Even settings in Photoshop, an indus-try standard that everyone uses, got named after processes and terms from the film darkroom.” Studio art professor Eli Durst said a re-emergence in the use of film photography is likely due to the extreme pop-ularity of apps such as Insta-gram and VSCO. These types of applications replicate some of the aesthetics that are char-acteristic of film. Durst also said quantifiable differences between the appearance of film versus digital photography are driving people to learn the original craft. “The structure of the image is built around grain, and grain feeling is so different than pix-els,” Durst said. “Film renders color so much differently than how digital technology.” Waiting for film to develop can make some impatient. But for UT alumna Anika Steppe, a medium format film photog-rapher, the anticipation of wait-ing for film to develop is the best part. “You really never know what it could end up looking like,” Steppe said. “Once you take the photo there are so many differ-ent visual outcomes that some-times you just don’t know what to expect.”Steppe believes the rapid-ly expiring art form still has a chance to make a come-back. Despite the dominating presence of digital photography, Steppe said her biggest hope for film is that a new generation will give it renewed life and ap-preciate the quintessential look and feel of film. “My optimism leads me to think that film will stick around,” Steppe said, “Hopeful-ly a new generation of people [will] pick it up and get hooked.”that thrive on the strange and exciting and build something only the two parties could cre-ate together. However, Watts’ influence is almost unnotice-able under the blare of droning bass and synths on the song, resulting in another potentially promising but wasted effort. “There Should Be Unicorns” is also an example of how nonsensical lead singer Wayne Coyne’s lyrics can be. As Coyne croons, he sings “Yeah, there should be day glow strippers, ones from the Amazon, some edible butterflies, we put ketch-up on.” The Flaming Lips have always been a concept-driven band, building their music on instrumentation and creating an experience rather than em-phasizing poetic lyrics, but lines like this have no place in almost any genre of music. The only track that stands out amongst the sea of medi-ocrity is “How??,” likely because it sounds like a parody of the entire album. Coyne himself stated in an interview with Fu-ture Heart that the lyrics are supposed to be “stream of con-sciousness emotional syllables,” but some of his word choices go beyond any semblance of rea-son, for example when Coyne sings “Back when we were young, we killed everyone, if they fucked us, with our baby guns.” Coyne’s lyrics are dom-inated by a droning and fuzzy bass that is beyond obnoxious. It’s actually a bit comical.I would not recommend that anyone try out this album. Long time Flaming Lips fans will be left wondering what happened to the potential of their previous LP The Terror, while any new listeners will be perplexed with what Coyne and company call music. This is an overproduced long shot from what the Lips were and leaves the listener with nothing but disappointment.Name: CLASSIFIDES; Width: 60p0; Depth: 10 in; Color: Black; Ad Number: -ADVERTISING TERMS There are no refunds or credits.

Texas appointed Tom Herman as its successor to former head coach Charlie Strong in late November, and Herman has worked tirelessly to hire his coach-ing staff ever since.Herman boasted a 22–5 record in two seasons at Houston and hopes to replicate that success with the Longhorns. He intro-duced several members of his former staff to Aus-tin, including his former defensive coordinator.Todd Orlando will re-place Vance Bedford and Strong in anchoring the young Longhorn defense. Orlando’s unit excelled last season at Houston, finishing with the 14th-ranked defense in total yards allowed per game. Conversely, Texas’ defense ranked 94th.“Todd is as good as it comes in a defensive coor-dinator,” Herman said. “He did an unbelievable job for us at Houston and has long track record of leading de-fenses that speaks for itself.” Orlando’s defense caused nightmares for running backs last season, only yielding 100.15 rushing yards per game — good for fourth in the nation. He also masterminded the stifling of Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson. His defense sacked the Louis-ville quarterback 11 times in a dominant victory.Orlando inherits a young but experienced front three in his 3–4 defensive scheme. Sophomore de-fensive end Charles Ome-nihu, sophomore defensive tackle Chris Nelson and ju-nior defensive tackle Poo-na Ford combined for five sacks last season but could be in for breakout seasons with Orlando at the helm. Orlando coached fresh-man defensive tackle Ed Oliver at Houston to All-American honors last season, so the defensive line is expected to flourish for the Longhorns in 2017.Offensively, Herman hired former Ohio State co-offensive coordinator Tim Beck on Jan. 3. Just three days prior, Beck was under national scrutiny after the Buckeyes’ offense posted zero points in a blowout loss to Clemson in the College Football Playoff semifinal. Herman didn’t take Ohio State’s struggle against the eventual na-tional champion as a sign of caution. “Not only is he a coach that is highly thought of in our business, but he’s an unbelievable person who does a tremendous job de-veloping players, building relationships, working with a staff, recruiting — every-thing you’re looking for as a head coach in an assis-tant,” Herman said. The Longhorns will lose Doak Walker Award win-ner D’Onta Foreman to the NFL Draft, but Beck has the weapons to revi-talize the offense. Four of 5 starting offensive linemen will return, along with two up-and-coming running backs in sophomore Chris Warren and freshman Kyle Porter.Along with play-calling duties, Beck assumes the position of quarterbacks coach for the Longhorns. He faces a crucial deci-sion this offseason — one that will probably linger until August. He must decide wheth-er freshman quarterback Shane Buechele or incom-ing commit and Elite 11 quarterback Sam Ehlinger will start under center. Eh-linger headlines Texas’ ear-ly recruiting class, one that will be complete on Nation-al Signing Day on Feb. 1.Herman has excelled at recruiting in the past, earning Houston’s first-ev-er five-star recruit when Oliver committed in 2016. His current recruiting class ranks in the 30s and 40s by various media outlets, but Herman can continue his recruiting success and continue bringing major changes to Texas. With a revamped staff and new recruits, Herman attempts to sculpt the pro-gram he envisions Texas will evolve into.Kansas remains atop Big 12 standingsThe No. 2 ranked Jayhawks (17–1, 6–0 conference) ex-tended their winning streak to 17 after yet another close victory on Monday. Iowa State (11–6, 3–3 conference) pulled within three points after senior guard Monte Morris hit a three-pointer with 26.6 seconds left in reg-ulation. But that’s as close as the Cyclones got. As time ex-pired, Kansas found itself on the right side of another nar-row victory, this time leaving Aimes with the 76-72 win. The Jayhawks will likely remain at No. 2 with their only loss coming at the hands of Indiana in the first game of the season. Since then, Kan-sas has gone undefeated in conference play in the midst of a 17-game win streak.However, the streak will be challenged in the near future. Starting on Jan. 24, the Jayhawks start what is arguably one of the tough-est three-game stretch-es in the nation. Head coach Bill Self ’s squad will match up against No. 7 West Virginia, No. 5 Kentucky and No. 6 Baylor.Baylor gets back on track after first loss of seasonBaylor (17–1, 5–1 confer-ence) was ranked No. 1 in the country for the first time in school history last week. But that lasted a little over 24 hours. Despite losing in Morgan-town last week, the Bears managed to get right back on track. Baylor followed up the loss to West Virginia with a nine-point victory over Kansas State and a 10-point win against Texas on Tuesday night. Baylor is one game behind Kansas, but with two match-ups remaining between the two, a shake-up could be in store. Bay-lor also has one more game against West Virginia, who could once again spoil the Bears’ hopes of stand-ing alone at the top of the Big 12. West Virginia rise spoiled by Sooners over BaylorThe No. 7 Mountaineers’ (15–3, 4–3 conference) victo-ry over then-No. 1 Baylor last week had the nation believing in the West Virginia hype. That is until Oklahoma (8-9, 2-4 conference) pulled off the 89-87 upset in overtime. West Virginia barely es-caped Austin with a 74-72 victory four days prior to the Baylor win, but it wasn’t able to avoid the upset a second time. Despite the loss, the Mountaineers remain in the third spot in the Big 12. But with a showdown against Kansas coming up on Jan. 24, the Mountaineers will have a shot to pull within a game of the first place Jayhawks. Oklahoma State remains win-less in Big 12 playThe Cowboys (10–8 overall, 0–6 conference) came into Big 12 compe-tition sitting comfortably at an impressive 10–2 re-cord. But the Pokes haven’t won since. Oklahoma State is current-ly sitting at the bottom of the Big 12 standings and contin-ues to look for a conference win. Many of the struggles can be put on the front end of the Cowboys’ conference schedule. Three of their first five conference loss-es came against No. 7 West Virginia, No. 2 Kansas and No. 6 Baylor.Freshman guard Andrew Jones continues to transition into a more complete player. Lately, it’s been noticeable.  Most collegiate players plow into a learning curve in their first season. Jones has yet to break out of that loop, but he’s close. “I think Andrew’s learning quite a bit,” head coach Shaka Smart said. “Like any other freshman, he’s had some ups and downs this year. Like any other freshman, at times things have been harder than maybe he anticipated.”But lately Jones has shown steady strides in his play. Over the past nine games, Jones has averaged 12.3 points, 3.9 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game. During that stretch, his field goal percentage is a respectable 44 percent, and his minutes have increased.It’s Jones’ versatility that sets him apart. He can score inside and outside. His 6-foot-4-inch, 190-pound frame makes him diffi-cult to guard. His speed and instincts make him a nightmare in the open court.“Transition is one of the areas that we felt like he was best at when we re-cruited him,” Smart said. “He’s still learning now at the college level when to at-tack the basket or shoot a three as opposed to when to give the ball up because in high school and AAU, he was basically unstoppable in transition.”Jones’ outside shooting ability has also emerged. Last Saturday against No. 7 West Virginia, Jones was unafraid to let it fly from behind the arc. He finished with 17 points and went 4-of-9 from the three-point line. It was the second time this season he’s hit four three-pointers in a game.On the defensive end, Jones must still progress. The former McDonald’s All-American even admitted after Texas’ 85-52 win over Eastern Washington on Nov. 17 that he “didn’t play much defense in high school.”“In practice, [the coaches are] on me a lot about staying in my stance and guarding,” Jones said. “Coach [Smart] gives me a lot of confidence that I can be a great defender.”Jones, a five-star recruit out of MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas, ar-rived on the 40 Acres as the No. 6-rated point guard in the country, according to Scout.com’s rankings.While Jones is not the floor general that former point guard Isaiah Tay-lor was, he still has seen an increased role in ball-han-dling duties to help out soph-omore guard Kerwin Roach Jr. So long as he protects the ball, of course.Jones has the second most turnovers on the team, be-hind only Roach. However, he has a positive assist to turnover ratio — one of only four players on the team with such a stat. But the added responsibil-ity is nothing new to Jones. He’s used to it by now. “In high school, that’s what I did,” Jones said. “I led the team. I ran the show. Now that Coach [Smart] is allow-ing me to do that more, it’s restored a lot of confidence in me on the court.”Name: 5318/Kunik Orthodontics; Width: 19p4; Depth: 4 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: 53186 SPTS6TYLER HORKA, SPORTS EDITOR | @texansportsThursday, January 19, 2017SIDELINETODAY IN  HISTORY2013Lance Armstrong admits to using performance-enhancing drugs during all seven of his Tour De France titles. “Watch your actions, they become your habits.

FOOTBALLHerman, staff poised to turn Longhorns around in springBy Steve Helwick@s_helwick@thedailytexanFollow us for news, updates  and more.Trio of Longhorns win individual honors Just a day after Clark Smith and Madisyn Cox were named National Swimmers of the Week, three more Longhorns re-ceived accolades for their efforts in the pool this past week. For the women, junior swimmer Rebecca Millard earned Big 12 Women’s Swimmer of the Week while sophomore diver Meghan O’Brien received the conference’s Women’s Diver of the Week honor.Millard helped stun then-No. 2 Georgia in Ath-ens, Georgia, by anchor-ing the team’s 200 medley relay squad to a dramatic triumph. She also took home individual victo-ries in both the 50- and 100-meter freestyle races. O’Brien brought forth victories at both the one-meter and three-me-ter diving levels in a Texas victory over then-No.14 Auburn. She placed sec-ond in both of those levels at Georgia, falling behind fellow teammate Alison Gibson both times. The women’s prowess in the upset victory at Geor-gia vaulted the team to No. 1 in the nation ahead of next weekend’s home meet with Arizona. On the men’s side, the Big 12 awarded senior swim-mer Will Licon with Men’s Swimmer of the Week. Licon is a six-time NCAA champion in addition to being an All-American. The senior stayed true to his dominant form in winning 5 of his 6 events to help lead Texas to victories over Auburn and Georgia. The men’s team remains ranked No. 2 nationally before taking on Arizona Jan. 27–28.—Tyler HorkaName: CROSSWORD; Width: 29p6; Depth: 5.5 in; Color: Black; Ad Number: -COMICS 7Today’s solution will appear here next issueArrr matey.

The towers were erected in response to a murder spree that struck fear into the hearts of Austinites in the 1890s. Though one of the victims’ hus-bands was tried and convicted, his verdict was overturned. To this day, the identity of the serial killer remains unclear, but people such as Galloway have hunches.“You really can’t get away with killing eight people in one space in that short of a time without leaving any traces behind,” Gal-loway said. Galloway’s interest in these murders was sparked when, as a graduate student in library science at UT, he drafted a research proposal on the topic.“I was working with these pieces of journalism that were so colorfully written,” Galloway said. “They were very interest-ing to read because it was like a 19th century murder mystery.”Years after he began this initial research, Galloway re-turned to this project and wrote a 2010 book whose ti-tle took the local name from the crimes: “The Servant Girl Murders.” Galloway said the digital age is making it easier to un-lock the mystery; he curates a website where he posts new details about the killings as they’re uncovered.“Research was really hard to do because it was before Google, but over the past few years new stuff has sur-faced as it’s being digitized,” Galloway said.Galloway believes the new information will help prove his theory that the killer was none other than Nathan Elgin, a cook who worked in a downtown Austin restaurant.“As a research librari-an,” Galloway said, “find-ing things is what I enjoy doing most.”Drawing from acid-infused hits of the 1960s and ’70s, the Flaming Lips found their way into limelight fame during the late 1990s with The Soft Bulletin. However, on their latest album Oczy Mlody, the Lips’ greatest strength becomes their downfall, spiraling the band into a monot-onous pattern even the most fervent of fans will struggle with.Upon the critical and com-mercial success of their 1999 masterpiece The Soft Bulletin, The Flaming Lips quickly be-came the new torchbearers of the psychedelic genre. Taking influences from Pink Floyd, the Doors and Can, the group introduced pop and philosophy into psychedelia,  developed a sound of their own and hit their peak with 2002’s Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. Fifteen years later, the group has made some controversial choices, like team-ing up with former Disney star Miley Cyrus and delving deeper into new instrumental territory on their latest record.The Lips make a bold statement right from the off-set by choosing a completely instrumental track to headline their album. Taking its name from the record’s Polish title, “Oczy Mlody” makes almost no sense as a song. The phrase translates as “eyes of the young,” but the cut rambles, heading in no clear direction and ending up as an adequate song at best. Oczy Mlody’s aimless mo-notony plagues the entire re-lease, with each song coming across as another wave in an ocean of unremarkable tracks. The album’s fourth song, “Sunrise (Eyes of the Sun),” at-tempts to change up the mood with a wider variety of sounds, but everything the Lips throw at the listener feels more like a 10-car pile up on the highway than a beautifully woven piece of music.The record’s third track, “There Should Be Unicorns,” carries the most potential of any on the album. Combining the talents of the Lips with those of Reggie Watts, the premise of the track is to take two artists M. Night Shyamalan — a name that triggers filmgoers and invites relentless parody. Since “Unbreakable,” his bat-ting average has been much less than stellar, with “The Happening” and “The Last Airbender” lowering the bar for Shyamalan and for movies in general.  Unlike many of his previ-ous films, Shyamalan’s “Split” has two important twists. Avoid spoiling the first for yourself, because the second twist is that “Split” is actually good. This taut and thrilling B-movie is a return to form for Shyamalan. It features an engaging narrative that avoids his worst tendencies and taps into his ingenuity and creativity.The film benefits most from its setting: a creepy basement where Kevin (James McAvoy) has imprisoned three girls — Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula). The cramped setting forces Shyamalan to be creative, and half the fun of “Split” comes from watching the characters work to outsmart their captor and escape.The other half comes from McAvoy’s performance, be-cause Kevin has dissociative identity disorder. He hous-es 23 personalities, ranging from an amicable fashion designer to a diabetic wom-an. Three of his personalities — the germaphobic Dennis, the religious Patricia and the nine-year-old Hedwig — have assumed control over the others, and they plan to feed the girls to Kevin’s emerging 24th personality: the Beast.The role of Kevin is an acting Olympics, and McA-voy wins the gold in every event. He deftly moves from personality to personality with startling proficiency, capable of making us laugh in one moment and then em-anating malevolence in the next.
