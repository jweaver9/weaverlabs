Less than five miles from Singapore’s skyscrapers and manicured trees, the mangroves were an integral part of a robust ecosystem supporting multitudes of flora and fauna; their dense roots helping to bind and build soil, reducing coastal erosion. Our 2021 Annual Report’s creative theme is inspired by these mangrove trees and the systems they nurture and connect. We selected the mangrove because it’s a metaphor for our work to build bridges and create enabling environments across philanthropy and the movements that we support. Mangroves, like the people who comprise the Astraea community, transform and strengthen ecosystems.It is a tremendous privilege to be part of this Astraea community and I have learned so much in the last year since joining as Executive Director in September 2021. Welcome from Joy ChiaI joined Astraea because I believe in the transformative power of feminist philanthropic practice, and because Astraea holds a very special place in my heart. Together with Astraea’s executive team, my priority in the coming years is to nurture this pioneering institution working at the nexus of LGBTQI activism and feminist funding so that we have the infrastructure, capacity and sustenance to continue the work that we are uniquely capable of doing.Our report, Sustaining Movements, Queering Philanthropy showcases the work Astraea has done in FY2021 to move resources where they are greatly needed and to continue to support LGBTQI organizing no matter how difficult the circumstances.• In 2021, Astraea disbursed more than $5.1 million USD to more than 240 organizations through 278 grants; • 70% of all our international grants went to grantees in the Global South, and East; and• A majority of our international grantmaking supported groups valiantly working in countries where civil societies are repressed and community organizing is highly restricted.Our funding supported our grantees as they adapted to respond to urgent needs in their communities and continued their critical community-building work. We move these resources to shift power, and we move resources to support the possibility of individual transformation, the possibility of community and belonging, and the possibility of alternative futures in the day-to-day lives of LGBTQI folks and communities. Living under the cloud of multiple pandemics has given us the opportunity to refine our purpose and recommit to our mandate to disrupt, to transform, and to queer philanthropy. We continue working to strengthen Astraea’s internal infrastructure, processes, and systems because we know that how we do our work is fundamental to the sustainability of our movements and Astraea as an institution. Though we evolve, learn, and adapt, we must also harness our commitment to transformative philanthropy and refine how, why, and where we work. This year, we are embarking on a process of strategic thinking and organizational planning to prepare for whatever storms lie ahead as well as the victories we are hoping to achieve. We welcome your support and guidance along the way.Yours in Solidarity, Joy L. Chia  Executive Director4 5   Annual Report 2021  //  A Letter from Joy A Letter from Joy  //     Annual Report 2021ADAPTING FOR TUMULTUOUS TIMES: ASTRAEA HIGHLIGHTSAs funders, we believe our responsibility is not only to resource our movements through grantmaking, but also to support them to grow and thrive through capacity building, accompaniment, and advocating for their brilliant work across philanthropy! This year, we continued to expand on these efforts: from our first open call for Strategic Communications grants, to supporting our grantees with pandemic-related emergency funds. Through building deep relationships with our grantees, our peers, and our donors, we’re working together to create stronger ecosystems to walk alongside our movements and understand what they need to remain resilient, fight back against exclusion and repression, and care for themselves and each other. 6 7   Annual Report 2021  //  Astraea Highlights Astraea Highlights  //     Annual Report 2021STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONSIn recent years, we’ve seen inspiring trends of LGBTQI activists achieving historic progress in some of the most restrictive social and political contexts. In response to this, we’ve also seen an increasingly polarized world where disinformation and false narratives are used to spread fear and justify discrimination against women and LGBTQI people. Many authoritarian governments even used the pandemic as an opportunity to crack down on civil society by targeting and scapegoating marginalized and excluded communities.8 9   Annual Report 2021  //  Astraea Highlights Astraea Highlights  //     Annual Report 2021Movement activists are prioritizing strategic communications as a proactive way to dispel disinformation and shape their own narratives that uplift the voices and realities of their communities. Unfortunately, grassroots organizations often have few resources or people power within their organizations that are dedicated to this critical work.Responding to this request from our partners, Astraea opened a call for strategic communications grants to seed LGBTQI organizations’ innovative and strategic approaches to messaging. Astraea was able to provide two-year strategic communications grants alongside core organizational funding to 17 grantee partners across Armenia, Nigeria, Kenya, Jamaica, and Trinidad & Tobago. These strategic communications grants are bolstering the work of our partners to ensure their messaging is connecting with the right people at the right time to achieve specific advocacy goals towards a more just world.By uplifting LGBTQI peoples’ realities and lived experiences, activists are shifting public discourse sharing a vision for a more just and equitable society both within and beyond their local communities. Astraea’s longstanding commitment has always been to amplify activists’ voices and stories, and equip them with the tools to make their own media and control their own narratives. Our strategic communications grants are a testament to that commitment. Each of the grantee partners are utilizing strategic messaging, storytelling, and advocacy as core tools for inspiring action towards collective liberation. This includes a diversity of approaches from reclaiming the indigenous history of diverse gender identities in their communities to uplifting the ways LGBTQI people are contributing to diverse professional fields today. In Kenya, the Intersex Persons Society of Kenya developed a public education campaign to amplify the lived realities and human rights priorities of intersex people in Kenya, and dispel the spread of misinformation. Like Kenya, Nigeria is a country where colonial-era laws criminalize LGBTQI communities. With our support, Women’s Health and Equal Rights Initiative (WHER) is producing a community-led web series telling the real stories of lesbian, bisexual, and queer Nigerians living authentic lives to combat stereotypes in a creative and fun way that is accessible to a broad audience. In the Caribbean, religious fundamentalist views and colonial-era laws have villainized LGBTQI people. TransWave Jamaica, a trans-led organization working in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean region, launched a campaign highlighting the beauty and brilliance of transgender Jamaicans and their contributions across different fields, consequentially challenging harmful stereotypes about gender diversity in Jamaica.Our Strategic Communications grantmaking allows our grantees to proactively shape narratives, build alliances and engage new audiences with a shared vision for a more hopeful and just future.10 11   Annual Report 2021  //  Astraea Highlights Astraea Highlights  //     Annual Report 2021The Intersex Human Rights FundAs Astraea Foundation’s Intersex Human Rights Fund (IHRF) entered its seventh grant-making cycle, we’re taking a moment to reflect on the evolution of the intersex movement and our role in supporting intersex-led organizations, projects and campaigns working to ensure the human rights, bodily autonomy, physical integrity and self-determination of intersex people worldwide. While the pandemic presented numerous challenges for our grantees, we also witnessed robust displays of resilience, resourcefulness and most importantly – collective care. This past year, IHRF provided multi-year grants for the first time, marking a major step in our ability to resource grantees in a more sustainable way. We continued our support of existing grantee partners while working with our Advisory Board to identify emerging organizations. Our funds helped with capacity-building and accompaniment programs, as well as pandemic-related emergency funds to access food, housing, and medical supplies and services. In many regions, the healthcare needs of intersex people were considered “nonessential” and job opportunities – particularly those in the informal sector – plummeted. Despite these hardships, our intersex-led grantee partners continued carrying out their work. Groups like the Intersex Community of Zimbabwe met in rural areas to host trainings and workshops and make hand soap and hand sanitizer. Intersex Turkey hosted their first intersex camp and welcomed nine intersex Turkish activists to participate. OII Europe started an online series called “Camp Fires” where intersex community members and activists came together to watch and discuss movies.We continued to work closely with regional organizations that have helped us identify and reach local groups. Historically, there have been few spaces where intersex people can gather and meet, so our funding of convenings has been important in building 12 13   Annual Report 2021  //  Astraea Highlights Astraea Highlights  //     Annual Report 2021more robust networks, coalitions and organizations. During the pandemic, regional grantees like Intersex Asia and Brújula Intersexual in Central America continued to support their ecosystem of activists through virtual support groups, as well as training and leadership development programs. We’re proud to see our grantees adapt and continue this critical community-building work.Astraea remains one of the few funders that supports the global intersex movement, but we have seen a few new funders come to the table as the movement gains momentum. We’ve engaged donors supporting intersex children’s rights and are building alliances with women’s rights and feminist funders whose work clearly intersects with ours. We are also strengthening our institutional infrastructure and have hired a third staff member to support this work.While the intersex movement is still in its nascent stages, we’re moved to see individuals and groups stand up and say, “I’m here” – even when they are risking their own safety. We are particularly excited to hear from activists in regions that have been traditionally underrepresented in this movement, such as North Africa and the Caribbean. These heroes are encouraging the next generation of powerful and innovative leaders who can take the movement forward. We’re proud to support them and look forward to learning from them.14 15   Annual Report 2021  //  Astraea Highlights Astraea Highlights  //     Annual Report 2021The LGBTI Global Human Rights Initiative (GHRI) is a public-private partnership that leverages financial and technical contributions from multiple government and private funders. The Initiative builds on an earlier public-private partnership with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which started in 2011, and marked the first time a U.S.-based LGBTQI organization received U.S. government funding to exclusively support global LGBTI work and the first time Astraea opted to receive U.S. government funding. The GHRI funds have allowed Astraea to scale our work by supporting our efforts around emergency response, grantmaking, research, and capacity strengthening.Q&A with the GHRI TeamWhy is the GHRI unique?Astraea’s model of partnership has transformed the way governments work with organizations in the LGBTQI space. Not only is the GHRI one of the few multilateral partnerships that provides flexible funding with streamlined reporting requirements, it’s also a space where we can amplify the work of our grassroots partners in a safe, confidential, and supportive way.Our multi-donor partnership spans over a decade and three U.S. government administrations. We have built a level of trust and understanding that is irreplaceable. Because of this trust, we have not had to compromise our principles and strategies in order to uplift the leadership of LGBTQI communities.What have been some key moments during the lifetime of the GHRI? The first partnership with USAID - the LGBTI Global Development Partnership (GDP) totaled $15 million. Building on its success, the GHRI  started in 2019, with an increased allocation of $27 million, that includes significant matching support from our resource partners. USAID is joined by government partners (such as the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and Global Affairs Canada) and, in the coming years, we hope to engage more bilateral partners and private funders to build on this success. Over the past decade, Astraea has supported other organizations to clearly and confidently determine how they can secure government funding while remaining true to their core feminist values.16 17   Annual Report 2021  //  Astraea Highlights Astraea Highlights  //     Annual Report 2021How did GHRI respond to the COVID-19 pandemic? The GHRI allocated significant additional funding towards mental health, holistic and collective care practices alongside our partners’ core work in supporting their communities. This aligns with our principles to support the movement leaders and activists as they deal with extreme burnout and trauma. We also expanded our support for typically underfunded regions and helped organizations on the ground scale up their emergency response grantmaking to support local activists. Why is this model important?The GHRI has demonstrated to both public and private funders that we can work together to shape a more inclusive and less burdensome approach to giving and more effectively channel funds to the human rights defenders on the frontlines.The pandemic reinforced why we believe multi-year core support and flexible funding are critical. Organizations needed to adapt quickly to the changing needs of their communities and respond adeptly to ever-changing public health guidance. We firmly believe that unrestricted funds allow communities on the ground to deploy resources how and when they deem best.18 19   Annual Report 2021  //  Astraea Highlights Astraea Highlights  //     Annual Report 2021Our grantees build power in a myriad of creative, dynamic ways which come together to create robust organizing ecosystems. These ecosystems are blossoming and taking root around the world to work towards our collective liberation. From providing critical public health services and guidance, to advocating for legal rights and recognition, our grantee partners are constantly working to create brighter, stronger futures for our people everywhere.

Every single dollar makes a difference, stretching all the way back to Astraea’s cross-class founding around a kitchen table in 1977. Therefore, we present our donor list alphabetically, rather than by size of gift, as a better reflection of our true appreciation of each and every one of you.

    "abstract": "s we grapple with the impacts of rising anti-rights movements, Astraea has needed to pivot to meet the needs of the moment both internally and externally. We asked ourselves: How do we meet the needs of grantees who are struggling to remain open and grappling with the various impacts of the pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted communities of color, particularly those in the Global South? What does it look like to create spaciousness and center staff wellness and sustainability so that we can support our movements for the long-term?Astraea's grantee partners – the LBTQI organizers on the frontlines – are often facing the brunt of violence in our communities; yet they are the ones charting the path towards our collective liberation. With your support during this critical moment, we are continuing to resource our grantee partners through no-strings-attached multi-year flexible grantmaking. It is more urgent than ever that we create alternative flows of resources and this is where Astraea is creating pathways of mobilizing and redistributing resources, with the goal of redistributing power to those who use it for social change.Living under the cloud of multiple pandemics has also given us the opportunity to refine our purpose and recommit to our mandate to disrupt, to transform, and to queer philanthropy. Through building deep relationships with our grantees, our peers, and our donors, we're working together to create stronger ecosystems to walk alongside our movements and understand what they need to remain resilient, fight back against exclusion and repression, and care for themselves and each other",
