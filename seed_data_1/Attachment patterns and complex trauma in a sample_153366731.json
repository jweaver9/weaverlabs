Although it has been proven that the psychologicalwellbeing of gender diverse persons is largely mediated by family acceptance andsupport, research on their relationships with parental figures is scarce. A total of 95adults took part in the study. The attachment distribution was as follows: 27% secure,27% insecure and 46% disorganized. Regarding early traumas, 56% experiencedfour or more traumatic forms. Further, gender dysphoric adults showed significantlyhigher levels of attachment disorganization and polyvictimisation, relative to controls.Comparisons of subgroups, defined by natal gender, showed that trans women,compared to control males, had more involving and physically and psychologicallyabusive fathers, and were more often separated from their mothers; trans men, relativeto female controls, had more involving mothers and were more frequently separatedfrom and neglected by their fathers. The research has several implications for treatment,clinical health psychology, family support and education.Keywords: gender dysphoria, transgender, clinical health psychology, attachment, complex trauma, parentalrelationshipsINTRODUCTIONGender dysphoria (GD) is described in the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013)as a condition in which individuals experience distress due to incongruence between their genderidentity (or experienced/expressed gender) and the gender they were assigned at birth. Findingsabout the incidence and prevalence of this condition are controversial (Coleman et al., 2012). DeCuypere et al. (2007), in their review involving eight countries, found a prevalence ranging from1:11,900 to 1:45,000 for trans women1 and 1:30,400 to 1:200,000 for trans men. Some authors havesuggested even higher – or increasing – prevalence rates (e.g., Olyslager and Conway, 2007; Collinet al., 2016; for a review, see Arcelus et al., 2015), which are supported by clinical observations(Cole et al., 1997; Coleman et al., 2012). With regard to etiology, no unequivocal factor has beenfound to determine GD (Meyer-Bahlburg, 2009; de Vries and Cohen-Kettenis, 2012). Rather, GDis widely considered a multi-factorial condition in which both psychosocial and biological aspects1In this paper, following Serano’s (2007) recommendations for less discriminatory terminology, we favor the forms “transwoman” (for natal males) and “trans man” (for natal females) over other widely used forms, such as “male-to-female” (MtF)or “female-to-male” (FtM). In this respect, we also wish to thank MD Jack Drescher (member of the DSM-5 Workgroup onSexual and Gender Identity Disorders and the ICD-11 Working Group on the Classification of Sexual Disorders and SexualHealth) for his advice.Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 February 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 60fpsyg-09-00060 January 30, 2018 Time: 15:33 # 2Giovanardi et al. Attachment and Trauma in Trans Adultsplay a role (de Vries and Cohen-Kettenis, 2012; AmericanPsychiatric Association [APA], 2013). The onset of GD typicallyoccurs very early, around the ages of 2 through 4, althoughit is also possible for the onset to occur much later, duringadolescence or even adulthood (Nieder et al., 2011; AmericanPsychiatric Association [APA], 2013; Zucker et al., 2016). Manychildren who experience GD do not continue to experience itafter puberty. Studies have found the percentage of persistenceinto adolescence and adulthood to vary from 2 to 20% (Steensmaet al., 2011, 2013). While factors associated with the persistenceof childhood GD are still unknown, the intensity of GD seems tobe an important predictor of persistence after puberty (Steensmaet al., 2013). Whether or not their GD persists, gender diversechildren and adolescents, compared to no-GD youth, are atgreater risk of suffering many psychological and social adversities.They experience poorer peer relations (e.g., Cohen-Kettenis et al.,2003; Zucker et al., 2012) and poorer family relations (e.g.,Grossman and D’Augelli, 2006; Hill and Menvielle, 2009), andthey are more psychologically vulnerable (e.g., Cohen-Ketteniset al., 2003; Singh et al., 2011; Steensma et al., 2014). Further,their psychological problems seem to be of a more internalizednature (e.g., presenting in depression and anxiety) than anexternalized nature (Coates and Person, 1985; Rekers and Morey,1989; Zucker and Bradley, 1995; Cohen-Kettenis et al., 2003;Steensma et al., 2014). However, there has been considerablevariability in the findings. For instance, percentages of clinical-range cases reported in studies using the Child Behavior Checklisttotal behavior problem score range from 13 to 84% (for anoverview, see Zucker et al., 2014). As Ristori and Steensma(2016) point out, to better understand the association betweenGD and the variability of psychological functioning in childrenand adolescents, we should consider the effect to be largelymediated by social intolerance to gender diversity. Variability inpsychological functioning in children with GD is expected tobe inversely correlated with the intensity of their experiencedsocial intolerance. Accordingly, there is evidence that perceptionof support within the family and with friends reduces the degreeof psychosocial impairment (e.g., Simons et al., 2013) and thusfunctions as a protective factor (Shiffman et al., 2016). However,research on the family environment and relations of childrenand adolescents with GD is scarce. As Dierckx et al. (2016)underline, research of this kind tends to be more qualitative thanquantitative. Negative reactions from parents, and sometimeseven their rejection of the child, is mentioned in various articles(Di Ceglie and Thümmel, 2006; Hill et al., 2010; Riley et al., 2011),but few studies have tried to explore the parental relationshipsand the traumatic experiences that can occur in the familyenvironment of a child or adolescent with GD.In this study, we evaluated the attachment patterns and historyof early relational traumas in a sample of trans adults with earlyonset GD (first childhood) (American Psychiatric Association[APA], 2013), in order to describe the less studied risk factorsfor the psychological outcomes of GD youth. Considering thevariety of life paths that can lead to a GD diagnosis, andfollowing the recent directions taken by the trauma literature,we conceptualized trauma more broadly than the definitionexpressed by PTSD diagnosis. We drew on the concept of“complex trauma” (Courtois, 2004; Cook et al., 2005), whichincludes child maltreatment, neglect, domestic violence and otherattachment-related trauma (Bailey et al., 2007), in addition toPTSD. Given that complex trauma and GD are both multi-determined constructs, we thought it more profitable to conceiveof early onset GD and early relational traumas as concurringrisk factors for adversity in psychological development. In thisframework, we considered trauma a dimension independent ofGD, and treated traumatic experiences in primary relationships –drawn close to attachment patterns – as important features ofthe complexity presented by gender variant individuals, ratherthan causative factors of their GD, as previously suggested in theliterature (see below).Gender Dysphoria and Complex TraumaComplex trauma can be understood as a set of experiencesof cumulative, chronic and prolonged traumatic events, mostoften of an interpersonal nature, involving primary caregiversand frequently arising in early childhood or adolescence(Courtois, 2004; Cook et al., 2005). Maltreatment experiencesmay include: severe neglect; exposure to domestic violence;intensive, painful medical conditions; and physical and sexualabuse (Zilberstein, 2014). Often, children suffering fromcomplex trauma face a combination of these experiences(Ford et al., 2010). Such children are at risk of developingdisorganized attachment relationships in infancy. The percentageof disorganized attachments in high-risk families has been shownto range from about 40 to 80% (Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz,2008; Liotti, 2013). The environment provided by maltreatingparents usually induces children to develop dissociative andavoidant strategies to cope with extreme emotions (Solomonand George, 1999; Briere, 2006; Cicchetti and Valentino, 2006;Bailey et al., 2007), and this prevents them from processing andnormatively integrating memories and experiences (Fonagy et al.,2000; Macfie et al., 2001).The relationship between relational trauma and GD has oftenbeen described as univocal. Many authors (e.g., Money andLamacz, 1984; Stoller, 1985; Money, 1986; Zucker and Kuksis,1990; Marantz and Coates, 1991; Zucker and Bradley, 1995) havespeculated about the influence of trauma, abuse, dysfunctionalparental conduct (such as a mother’s extreme closeness withher child), parental dynamics or pathology (such as maternaldepression or the absence of a father) and parents’ atypicalpsychosexual development (such as their confusion about theirown feelings of masculinity and femininity) on children. Ithas been thought that such environmental patterns might limitchildren’s opportunities to identify with the same-sex parentand to experience cross-gender reinforcement patterns (for adiscussion, see Hill and Menvielle, 2009). Transsexualism hasoften been interpreted as an extreme dissociative defense againsttrauma experienced in early relationships (Coates and Person,1985; Devor, 1994; Di Ceglie, 1998). However, to date, no solidempirical support has been produced by studies testing thesehypotheses. The co-occurrence with dissociation, for instance,suggested by many theoretical and clinical studies (e.g., Coons,1984; Putnam, 1989; Devor, 1994; Modestin and Ebner, 1995),was recently effectively disputed (Colizzi et al., 2015).Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 60fpsyg-09-00060 January 30, 2018 Time: 15:33 # 3Giovanardi et al. Attachment and Trauma in Trans AdultsAs mentioned above, research on the experience of complextrauma in GD individuals is limited. In comparison to thegeneral population, individuals with GD have been shown tobe more subject to devaluation, oppression and discrimination(e.g., Lombardi et al., 2002; Melendez and Pinto, 2007; Bocktinget al., 2013). Some (mostly descriptive) studies have reported ahigh frequency in transsexual individuals of childhood sexualand physical abuse perpetrated by parents and caregivers (Pauly,1974; Lothstein, 1983; Devor, 1994; Gehring and Knudson, 2005;Wilchins, 2006; Wharton, 2007; Veale et al., 2008; Cussino et al.,2017; Lingiardi et al., 2017). Moreover, one study showed thatpatients in gender clinics were more likely than psychiatricpatients to report parental death during adolescence and earlyadulthood (Bernstein et al., 1981). As Bandini et al. (2011) pointout, children showing gender atypicality are at higher risk ofmaltreatment and abuse, and suffer reprisals from parents as aconsequence of their cross-gender behavior (Corliss et al., 2002;Nuttbrock et al., 2010). Nuttbrock et al. (2009), after interviewinga wide sample of trans women, reported that the majority ofthe women had failed to disclose their gender incongruence toparents and siblings in early adolescence, and thus had beenunable to benefit from the protection of family support, which hasbeen shown to be a protective factor for mental health (Simonset al., 2013). Three other studies with trans samples (Grossmanet al., 2005, 2006; Grossman and D’Augelli, 2006; Grossman et al.,2006) showed that many GD youth reported experiences of verbaland physical abuse from family members and neighbors, andnegative reactions from parents when they came out.Gender Dysphoria and AttachmentFew studies on GD patients have examined attachment processesand patterns. With regard to children, Goldberg (1997) reporteda higher rate of insecurity in boys with GD (formerly knownas “gender identity disorder” [GID]), compared to a normativepopulation. Birkenfeld-Adams (2000) confirmed this higherpercentage of boys with GID in a modified Strange Situation,finding insecure attachment in 73% of the sample. Cooper et al.(2013) highlighted a negative association between the relatedconstruct of “gender contentedness” and avoidant attachmentin both boys and girls, and with preoccupied (ambivalent)attachment in boys in a fifth grade sample. As DeKlyen andGreenberg (2016) state, youth with GD seem to be at increasedrisk for insecure attachment; however, there is no consensus onthe form of this insecurity.Few researchers have used the Adult AttachmentInterview (AAI) with transsexual or gender-variant populations.Cook (1999) studied attachment patterns in a group ofsix fathers of GID boys, finding the presence of fourunresolved/disorganized states of mind and two that werepreoccupied with a secondary unresolved classification. Vitelliand Riccardi (2010) found, in a sample of 18 transsexual adults,a high percentage of unresolved/disorganized states of mind(39%) and insecure patterns (72%). The authors also found animpressively high frequency of traumatic experiences withinthe first 10 years of life. Colizzi et al. (2013) found a highpercentage of insecure attachment (70%) in their sample of 50adult transsexuals. Finally, in a recent study, Lingiardi et al.(2017) found a high percentage of unresolved/disorganizedstates of mind (50%) and a considerably high percentage ofsecure patterns (39%). Moreover, 29 (66%) of the 44 individualshad traumatic childhood experiences relating to the loss of anattachment figure or physical or sexual abuse.In response to the identified gaps in the literature, thisstudy aimed at gaining in-depth knowledge of some problematicfeatures that may be grounds for psychological complicationsin trans people and may interfere with their gender expression.Specifically, we aimed at exploring gender variant persons’attachment representations and history with primary figuresin early experiences of trauma and loving caregiving, andcomparing these findings with those of a cisgender controlgroup. In order to explore the internalized aspects of parentalrelationships in our subjects, we narrowed our analysis to theAdult Attachment Interview subscales concerning states of minddirectly connected to parental figures (e.g., idealization, angerand derogation). At a deeper level of enquiry, we then performedcomparisons of subgroups. To analyze attachment and trauma,we broke our sample down according to gender (trans womenvs. trans men). Additionally, regarding trauma, we comparedtrans women to male controls and trans men to female controls,in order to explore the differences in natal males and femalesbetween transgender and cisgender developmental paths. At theheart of our research was an intention to update psychologicaland clinical perspectives on the developmental environment oftrans persons, highlighting the impact that adversities in thefamily context may have on their adult adaptation. Our aimwas to read these adversities not as they have been read in thepast – as etiological factors for GD – but as instances of risk thatshould be carefully managed by psychologists working with transpeople. Ultimately, the purpose of this study was to contribute toand facilitate trans persons’ development of a free and personalidentity during their transition path.To sum up, we aimed to test the following hypotheses:(1) The first hypothesis postulated that in our sample of genderdysphoric people unsecure and disorganized attachmentclassifications were more frequent, relative to controls;(2) The second hypothesis assumed that in the genderdysphoric sample higher frequencies of traumaticexperiences could be found within early caregivingrelationships, compared to controls;(3) The third hypothesis postulated that in the genderdysphoric sample early experiences of a loving caregivingwere less frequent compared to controls;(4) The forth hypothesis assumed that it was possible tofind differences regarding attachment and complex traumabetween trans women and trans men.MATERIALS AND METHODSParticipantsThe study was conducted with 95 GD adults (74 trans women,21 trans men). The sample was recruited from the Service forAdaptation of Physical Identity to Psychological Identity ClinicalFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 February 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 60fpsyg-09-00060 January 30, 2018 Time: 15:33 # 4Giovanardi et al. Attachment and Trauma in Trans AdultsCenter (SAIFIP, San Camillo-Forlanini Hospital, Rome) andthe Gender Dysphoria Psychological Service – Department ofClinical Neurosciences, Reproductive and OdontostomatologicalSciences (UPCPA, Federico II University Hospital, Naples). Allparticipants declared an early onset of GD (first childhood). Themean age of the full sample was 29 years (SD = 7.2); the samemean age was identified for trans women (SD = 7.8) and transmen (SD = 5.0). All trans men were Italian, while 86% of transwomen were Italian and 14% were South American. With respectto the level of education, 3% had an elementary license, 39% hada middle school license, 51% had a high school diploma and 7%had a college degree.The control group, which was recruited through snowballsampling by the authors in Rome and Naples, was composedof 123 non-clinical persons (61 male, 62 female). The mean ageof the total sample was 34 years (SD = 10.2); the mean age ofmales was 35 years (SD = 11.9) and the mean age of femaleswas 33 years (SD = 5.6). Aside from 2% of the sample, all wereItalian. With respect to the level of education, 27% had a middleschool license, 54% had a high school diploma and 19% hada college degree. The overall sample was recruited expressivelyasking for a participation secured through a written informedconsent procedure that required active consent from participants.The current study has been attended within the Ph.D. contextat the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology (Facultyof Medicine and Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome)and received the approval from the Ethical Committee of theDepartment (n◦ 24/2016).MeasuresAdult Attachment Interview (AAI; George et al., 1984;Main et al., 2003)The AAI is a semi-structured interview following an hour-long protocol, which explores adults’ mental representationsof attachment while discussing childhood experiences. Afterproviding an overview of their family composition, respondentsare asked to describe their early relationships with parents,supplying five adjectives and supporting these with descriptionsof specific incidents. Additionally, interviewees are probedregarding situations of distress (e.g., emotional upset, hurt, orillness) and instances of threat or abuse. Following this, questionsare posed concerning respondents’ early reactions to separationfrom a caregiver and significant loss. The interview transcripts arescored on thirteen 9-point scales. Five scales assess the “probablechildhood experience” with caregiving figures (loving, rejecting,neglecting, involving, pushing to achieve), whereas eight scalesassess the current mental state with regard to attachment(idealization, anger, derogation, passivity, lack of memory, meta-cognition, coherence of transcript, and coherence of mind).The AAI score is based on the participant’s ability to producecoherent narratives of childhood experiences with caregivers thatclassify the respondent as Secure/Autonomous (F), Dismissing(Ds), Entangled/Preoccupied with respect to attachment (E)or “Cannot Classify” (CC) when a global breakdown inthe organization of discourse arises. An interviewee mayalso be assigned an Unresolved/Disorganized state of mind(U) concerning past abuse or loss in association with abest-fitting primary classification. Psychometric testing andmeta-analyses have provided evidence of the AAI’s stabilityand discriminant and predictive validity in both clinicaland non-clinical populations (Bakermans-Kranenburg and VanIJzendoorn, 1993; Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn,2009; Sagi et al., 1994; van IJzendoorn, 1995; Roisman et al.,2007; Hesse, 2008; van IJzendoorn and Bakermans-Kranenburg,2008). In the present study, each interview was recorded,transcribed verbatim and coded by certified raters (AF, GG,CMV) according to the AAI coding and classification system(Main et al., 2003). All transcripts were double-coded, blindto subject conditions. When disagreement arose, a thirdindependent coder categorized the relevant transcript and,following discussion between all three coders, a final agreementwas reached.Complex Trauma Questionnaire (ComplexTQ;Maggiora Vergano et al., 2015)The ComplexTQ is a 70-item scale for the retrospectiveassessment of multi-type maltreatment, measuring lack ofcare (physical and emotional neglect), abuse (psychological,physical and sexual abuse) and other traumatic experiences, suchas rejection, role reversal, exposure to domestic violence,separation and loss. The instrument is available in twodifferent versions: clinician-report and self-report. Thequestionnaire assesses adverse experiences from childhood(to the age of 14) involving maternal, paternal and otherattachment figures, separately. In the current study, theclinician-report version was used and applied to the AAItranscripts. The questionnaire requires approximately 15 to20 min to complete, depending on the length of the interviewtranscript. Scores for the presence and frequency of traumaticexperiences in each domain are automatically provided by thesoftware.Concerning the analyses of the current study, for theattribution of attachment categories we used the scoring systemof Main et al. (2003), which takes in account specific cut-offsfor the state of mind scales. We considered these scales alsofor comparisons between groups and subgroups, to identifythe prevalent representational characteristics of the participants.With regard to experience scales, we took in account only theLoving scale, which was identified as a protective factor againsttraumas (see Murphy et al., 2014). Other experience scales areexplored in a thorough way by the ComplexTQ. Due to thelarge number of t-test comparisons, we performed a multipletesting correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) method(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) to adjust the p-values into falsediscovery rate (FDR).RESULTSAttachment ClassificationsAnalysis of the 4-way distribution of AAI transcripts highlightedthat, within the control group, 61% were classified as F, 19%were classified as Ds, 7% were classified as E and 13% wereclassified as U. With regard to the GD participants, 27% wereFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 February 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 60fpsyg-09-00060 January 30, 2018 Time: 15:33 # 5Giovanardi et al. Attachment and Trauma in Trans Adultsclassified as F, 14% were classified as Ds, 13% were classified asE and 46% were classified as U. Focusing on the disorganizedportion of the GD sample, 19% were classified as U, 17%were classified as CC and 10% were classified as both U andCC. Despite the heterogeneity of the GD persons’ disorganizedprofiles, analysis of the standardized residuals highlighted anoverrepresentation of CC (sr = 3.4) and U/CC (sr = 2.7)classifications.Table 1 shows the distribution of AAI classifications forGD patients and controls within the dimensions of security–insecurity and organization–disorganization. The GD patients’distribution differed significantly from that of the controls onboth comparisons. In the security–insecurity comparison (χ2[1,N = 218] = 24.347, p = 0.000, effect size ϕ = 1.65), there wasan underrepresentation of F classifications (sr = −2.7) and anoverrepresentation of insecure categories (sr = 2.5). Regardingthe distribution of organized (F, Ds, and E) and disorganized (Uand CC) classifications [χ2(1, N = 218) = 29.810, p = 0.000,effect size ϕ = 2.01], in the GD sample, disorganized states ofmind were overrepresented (sr = 3.5) and, to a lesser extent,fewer organized attachments (sr = −2.2) than expected werefound.We then compared the GD group to normative and combinedclinical samples from international (Bakermans-Kranenburg andvan IJzendoorn, 2009) and national meta-analyses (Cassibbaet al., 2013), with reference to the 4-way AAI distribution andthe organized vs. disorganized classifications (Table 2). Analysesof the 4-way distribution showed that our GD group differedsignificantly from normative samples – both international (χ2[3,N = 788] = 45.503, p = 0.000, effect size Cramer’s V = 0.94)and Italian (χ2[3, N = 937] = 119.800, p = 0.000, effectsize Cramer’s V = 2.26), and, to a lesser extent, to theItalian clinical sample (χ2[3, N = 355] = 14.347, p = 0.002,effect size Cramer’s V = 0.44) – whereas no difference wasfound between our GD group and the international clinicalsample. As to the comparison of organized and disorganizedAAI classifications, the GD group was strongly significantlydifferent from normative samples – both international (χ2[1,N = 788] = 39.085, p = 0.000, effect size ϕ = 1.39) andItalian (χ2[1, N = 937] = 115.369, p = 0.000, effect sizeTABLE 1 | Adult attachment interview (AAI) classifications distribution (secure vs.insecure and organized vs. disorganized) for GD patients and controls.Controls GD patients(n = 123) (n = 95)Secure (F) 75 (61%) 26 (27%)(sr = 2.4) (sr = −2.7)Insecure (Ds, E, U, CC) 48 (39%) 69 (73%)(sr = −2.2) (sr = 2.5)Organized (F, Ds, E) 107 (87%) 51 (54%)(sr = 1.9) (sr = −2.2)Disorganized (U, CC) 16 (13%) 44 (46%)(sr = −3.1) (sr = 3.5)F, free/autonomous; Ds, dismissing; E, entangled/preoccupied; U, unresolved/disorganized; CC, cannot classify; sr, standardized residuals.ϕ = 3.77) – although it showed no differences relative to clinicalsamples.AAI State of Mind ScalesAs mentioned above, we opted to explore the AAI state of mindscales for Idealization, Derogation and Anger. Table 3 showsthe mean scores of the three scales for the two groups. In GDpatients, after the BH correction, only Anger toward fathersresulted significantly higher, relative to the control group.Trans Women vs. Trans MenWith regard to the comparison between trans women andtrans men in the GD sample, the 4-way AAI distribution, thedistribution of secure vs. insecure AAI classifications and thedistribution of organized vs. disorganized AAI classificationsshowed no significant differences. Concerning the AAI stateof mind scales, the only significant difference between the twosubgroups was observed with regard to Idealization (t[2.618,p = 0.012, df = 92]), showing that trans women idealized theirmothers to a greater extent.History of Complex TraumaTrauma OccurrencePresence of a traumatic history was evaluated with theComplexTQ, which considered participants’ experiences of manyforms of relational trauma to the age of 14, within primaryrelationships. Results showed that 10% of GD participants hadnot experienced any early adversity, 13% had experienced oneform of trauma, 8% had experienced two forms, 13% hadexperienced three forms and 56% had experienced four ormore forms. In the control group, 30% of participants had notexperienced any form of trauma, 37% had experienced one formof trauma, 16% had experienced two forms, 9% had experiencedthree forms and 7% had experienced four or more forms.Table 4 shows the distribution of individuals (GD patientsand controls) with experience of fewer than four traumaticforms against those who were polyvictimised, showing experienceof four or more forms of trauma. We opted for thisgrouping, following the examples of Finkelhor et al. (2007)and Murphy et al. (2014), who identified the co-occurrenceof four or more forms of adversity as a marker of hightraumatisation. The percentage of those who had experiencedfewer than four forms of trauma was lower in the GD group(44%) than the control group (93%). The distribution in oursample strongly differed from that of the control group [χ2(1,N = 218) = 61.881, p = 0.000, effect size ϕ = 4.19], showinga robust overrepresentation of polyvictimisation (sr = 5.0) andan underrepresentation of fewer than four experienced forms oftrauma (sr =−3.2).We also compared our GD group with the clinical sampleof Maggiora Vergano et al. (2015), which was composed ofindividuals with dissociative and personality disorders. Nosignificant differences were found between our group andthe clinical sample, even when the occurrence of types ofadversities were merged (<4 = absence vs. ≥4 = presence ofpolyvictimisation).Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 February 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 60fpsyg-09-00060 January 30, 2018 Time: 15:33 # 6Giovanardi et al.

In our sample, also after theBH correction, significantly lower scores were found on thefollowing scales, all regarding the relationship with the mother:Neglect and Reject, and, to a lesser extent, Psychological Abuse,Physical Abuse and Witnessing Domestic Violence. There wereno significant differences between the two samples for the Lossscales.GD vs. Control SubgroupsWe first compared trauma frequency between trans women andmale controls, and subsequently between trans men and femalecontrols.TABLE 4 | Occurrence of trauma (<4 vs. ≥4) for GD patients and controls.Controls GD patients(n = 123) (n = 95)<4 114 (93%) 42 (44%)(sr = 2.8) (sr = −3.2)≥4 9 (7%) 53 (56%)(sr = −4.4) (sr = 5.0)<4 = individuals with experiences of fewer than four typologies of trauma;≥4 = individuals with experiences of four or more typologies of trauma(polyvictimisation).The intensity of different traumatic experiences suffered bythe GD and control subgroups, as yielded by the ComplexTQscales, is shown in Tables 6A,B. Regarding the comparisonbetween trans women and male controls, trans women resultedto have, following the BH correction, significantly higher scoreson the following scales: father’s Reject, Physical and PsychologicalAbuse, and Neglect from both parents. Fathers’ Neglect andReject yielded the largest effect sizes.

No significant difference was found in the comparisonsbetween control males and trans women and between controlfemales and trans men, nor between trans women and transmen.DISCUSSIONIn the current study, we explored the attachment representationsand narratives and early relational history of a sampleof GD adults at two levels of analysis. The first levelconsidered the entire GD sample and compared this samplewith controls and other samples from the literature; thesecond level narrowed the investigation to GD subgroups,comparing attachment and early relational experiencesbetween trans women and trans men and experiencesof trauma between trans women and male controls andbetween trans men and female controls. In the current section,summaries of the main findings are presented for the reader’sconvenience.Concerning the first level of inquiry (into attachment), it isnoteworthy to underline that almost half of our sample (46%)was marked by a high percentage of U and CC classifications,indicating a prevalence of insecurity. In the control group, onlyone form of disorganization was found: the U profile with regardto loss, due in most cases to recent deaths. In contrast, the GDsample showed all three forms of disorganized profiles (19% U,17% CC and 10% U/CC).TABLE 5 | Comparison of our GD sample and literature data (Maggiora Vergano et al., 2015∗) on frequency of trauma.GD (n = 95) Clinical sample∗ (n = 56) t (df = 149) Effect size (Cohen’s d) p FDRNeglect Mothers 1.50 (0.65) 2.03 (0.66) −4.768 0.81 <0.001 0.000Fathers 2.12 (0.92) 2.07 (0.76) 0.364 – n.s. n.s.Reject Mothers 1.33 (0.46) 1.75 (0.62) −4.366 0.80 <0.001 0.000Fathers 1.65 (0.65) 1.64 (0.56) 0.059 – n.s. n.s.Role reversal Mothers 1.30 (0.42) 1.39 (0.62) −0.990 – n.s. n.s.Fathers 1.05 (0.18) 1.12 (0.34) −1.428 – n.s. n.s.Psychological abuse Mothers 1.11 (0.16) 1.22 (0.24) −3.087 0.57 <0.05 0.015Fathers 1.15 (0.22) 1.18 (0.21) −0.758 – n.s. n.s.Physical abuse Mothers 1.16 (0.29) 1.39 (0.54) −2.979 0.57 <0.05 0.016Fathers 1.24 (0.43) 1.32 (0.49) −1.063 – n.s. n.s.Sexual Abuse Mothers 1.02 (0.13) 1.04 (0.18) −0.851 – n.s. n.s.Fathers 1.01 (0.08) 1.03 (0.15) −1.165 – n.s. n.s.Other figures 1.09 (0.29) 1.06 (0.22) 0.584 – n.s. n.s.Domestic violence Mothers 1.21 (0.48) 1.46 (0.62) −2.586 0.47 <0.05 0.021Fathers 1.27 (0.59) 1.46 (0.62) −1.862 – n.s. n.s.Separations Mothers 1.20 (0.58) 1.29 (0.62) −0.814 – n.s. n.s.Fathers 1.56 (0.90) 1.75 (0.89) −1.243 – n.s. n.s.TABLE 6A | Comparison of subgroups (male controls vs. trans women) with regard to frequency of trauma.Male controls (n = 61) Trans women (n = 74) t (df = 133) Effect size (Cohen’s d) p FDRNeglect Mothers 1.23 (0.34) 1.49 (0.66) −2.963 0.48 <0.05 0.021Fathers 1.39 (0.38) 2.08 (0.89) −6.076 0.98 <0.001 0.000Reject Mothers 1.16 (0.38) 1.32 (0.47) −2.097 0.37 <0.05 n.s.

Specifically, withrespect to GD samples, the high occurrence of U and CCin our group confirmed the association between disorganizedpatterns and transsexualism that has been found in previousstudies (Cook, 1999; Vitelli and Riccardi, 2010; Lingiardi et al.,2017). Moreover, the heterogeneity of disorganized profilesthat defined our GD sample denoted the presence of botha local breakdown in discourse strategies regarding loss orabuse and a global disruption of attachment strategies alongthe entire transcript. Many of the participants’ attachmentnarratives were characterized by a lack of autobiographicalcoherence and integration, revealing difficulties in connecting thepast and present elements of one’s personal history, depictingbalanced portraits of caregiving figures and giving importance toattachment experiences. As was found in the clinical populationscited above, these deficits could be attributable to a harshand careless caregiving environment during childhood; such anenvironment may have undermined our participants’ personalsense of safety.Significant differences were also found in specific AAI state ofmind scales: our GD group showed higher Anger toward fathersand, to a lesser extent (with smaller effect sizes), Derogationtoward fathers and Idealization toward mothers, relative tocontrols.With regard to these comparisons regarding state of mindscales, our aim was not to typify our individuals as belongingto specific attachment classifications, rather to comparerepresentational ‘stances’ between groups and subgroups. Theemerged polarized representations of parental figures are worthyof notice, since they add another aspect of unbalance to theparticipants’ attachment narratives regarding representationsof their parents. As mentioned above, psychological andpsychoanalytical theories have mostly seen family dysfunctionsas etiological factors of transsexual conditions. In contrast,we took an agnostic approach to causation, consideringinsecure and disorganized attachment patterns – as well asadversity in early relationships – as potential concurrent riskfactors for GD persons’ psychological development. Despiteresounding psychoanalytical etiological accounts such as Coates’(Coates and Person, 1985) focus on trans children’s separationanxiety from their mother and their fantasized connection toher and Stoller; Stoller’s (1968; 1985) remark about fathers’absence and emotional unavailability, these findings should beinterpreted cautiously, especially those regarding Idealizationand Derogation, that resulted not significant following theBergamini–Hochberg correction, and should not be understoodto suggest causation. We do not consider these states of mind(Idealization of mothers and Anger and Derogation towardfathers) signals of ancient psychological identifications that formgender identity; rather, we see them as opposing representationsof acceptance and non-acceptance of parental figures.Considering the second major focus of the study, relatingto personal histories of complex trauma, the presence andintensity of multiple forms of early relational trauma wereinvestigated. In more than half of trans participants (56%), weobserved a co-occurrence of multi-type maltreatments duringchildhood, leading to polyvictimisation (Finkelhor et al., 2007,2011). Relative to controls, GD participants had experience ofsignificantly more traumatic forms, including both active traumaFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 February 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 60fpsyg-09-00060 January 30, 2018 Time: 15:33 # 9Giovanardi et al. Attachment and Trauma in Trans Adultsand severe neglect. Considering the wide range of traumaticexperiences found in this sample, these findings assuredlyindicate the presence of complex trauma, highlighting differencesin the parental couple. We discuss the parent–child relationshipin more detail below, in our evaluation of the comparisonsbetween subgroups.In our comparison of the GD group to a sample ofhighly traumatized individuals with dissociative and personalitydisorders (Maggiora Vergano et al., 2015), we found similar levelsof polyvictimisation. However, there were significant differencesin the frequency of different types of trauma in the relationshipwith mothers: GD individuals were less neglected, rejectedand psychologically and physically abused, and witnessed lessdomestic violence involving their mothers compared to theclinical sample. This outcome highlights the more supportiverole that mothers might have had in our sample; in light ofa comparable frequency of traumatic experiences, mothers ofGD youth seem to have provided better backup. In contrast,relationships with fathers were similarly dysfunctional andcompromised in both samples.In general, the results regarding trauma confirm and extendprevious findings on risk for maltreatment and abuse fortrans youth (e.g., Nuttbrock et al., 2009, 2010; Bandini et al.,2011). Our participants were exposed to several early relationalforms of trauma and victimization, from multiple sources. Thisoutcome highlights the degree of compromise in their caregivingenvironment and may explain the high frequency of attachmentdisorganization in the sample.In order to obtain a better understanding of the quality andnature of GD participants’ relationships with primary figures,we also explored their positive experiences of loving caregiving.We found that fathers of GD participants were less accepting,available and supportive compared to fathers of controls. Therewere no significant differences in mothers between groups. Weshould consider how, beyond the connections between traumaticexperiences and GD, the complicated development of a genderatypical identity may have been further hindered by a lack ofsupport and exposure to trauma within the family, especiallyfrom fathers. This may have led GD persons to separate anddis-integrate their representations, memories and experiences.Relationships with mothers seemed less traumatic, but, comparedto controls, mothers of our GD participants were more idealized.In this regard, we must consider a more general aspect: as attestedby the literature and in line with the social attitudes and cultureat the time of our participants’ childhood, when children needcare due to illness or distress, mothers tend to assume the majorresponsibility for this care, whereas fathers tend to carry on withduties related to the maintenance of the household and are lessinvolved in affectively supporting the child (e.g., Mattson andWeisberg, 1970; Frank et al., 1986). Moreover, fathers are morelikely to expect their children to adhere to cultural stereotypes(e.g., Langlois and Downs, 1980). With respect to our GDsample, and supported by Wren’s (2002) research on transgenderadolescents, the participants’ fathers may have cut themselves offfrom emotional issues, while their mothers may have maintaineda better relationship with their children and been – at least byall appearances – more accepting. High scores on Idealizationof mothers may suggest that this positive representation was, inmost cases, generalized and skin-deep, as it was unsupported byrecounted episodes.Following this exploration, we engaged in a deeper level ofanalysis, splitting our sample into two subgroups of trans womenand trans men and the control group into males and females.Regarding attachment patterns, no significant differencewas observed in the comparison between GD subgroups.This highlights the homogeneity in our sample with regardto the distribution of attachment classifications. Therefore,dysfunctionality in attachment may not be specifically linked withexperienced gender but, more generally, with the fact that transpeople are a group at risk. Moreover, as Bakermans-Kranenburgand van IJzendoorn (2009) state, no significant gender differencehas been found in numerous studies using the Adult AttachmentInterview.Concerning the AAI scales, trans women showed greaterIdealization of mothers than did trans men. Thus, the greaterIdealization of mothers in our sample relative to controls couldbe largely attributable to the trans women subsample. We discussthis finding further, below.Regarding trauma history, whilst no difference emerged fromthe comparison within the GD group, interesting findingsemerged from comparisons of the GD sample and controls,when divided according to natal gender (trans women vs.control males; trans men vs. control females). Trans women,compared to control males: (1) were more neglected by bothparents; (2) had more involving, rejecting and physically andpsychologically abusive fathers; and (3) suffered more frequentlyfrom an early loss of the father. On the other hand, trans men,compared to female controls: (1) were more often victims ofintensive rejection, neglect and early separation from fathers; (2)had more psychologically abusive mothers; and (3) prematurelyexperienced more losses of close relatives and friends.The overall findings of this deeper level of enquiry highlightsome interesting aspects of parental aversive relationshipsand representations in the two GD subgroups. Overall,both subgroups suffered from severe neglect, rejection andpsychological abuse. The results of the trans women areparticularly interesting because they disprove the classicalpsychoanalytic view of female transsexuals’ fathers only as absentfigures. In our sample, the trans women’s fathers, althoughstrongly neglecting and rejecting their children, were also present,involving and psychologically abusive, and their mothers werenot blissfully symbiotic – they too neglected their children,though to a lesser degree than the fathers. For the trans women,idealization of mothers could be interpreted as idealization of thefeminine figure or feminine aspects they felt were their own.2Moreover, it is interesting to note that regarding psychologicalabuse the comparison between trans men and female controlspresented a reversed finding: the main psychologically abusivefigure in the trans men’s parental relationships was the mother,and not the father.2In this regard, it is interesting to note that, in many cases, the adjectives chosenby trans women to describe their mothers were generic and stereotyped (e.g., “all-mothery,” “mother love of my life,” “we were all one,” “good mother”) and oftenrelated to physical aspects (“beautiful,” “seductive,” “all men liked her”).Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 February 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 60fpsyg-09-00060 January 30, 2018 Time: 15:33 # 10Giovanardi et al. Attachment and Trauma in Trans AdultsThese outcomes have several implications for clinicalpractice, family support and education. Assessment andclinical management of GD patients are often provided withinmultidisciplinary gender clinics. In these centers, patients arefollowed by psychiatrists, pediatricians, psychologists, andpsychotherapists, working side by side with endocrinologistsand surgeons. Within psychological assessment and support,we believe that attachment and trauma investigation couldplay a crucial role in bringing to light conflicts and defensesthat may interfere with a free exploration of gender identity.Such an exploration might suffer from the negative impact ofearly relationships with parental figures. Interiorisation of earlyexperiences may pollute a profound sense of gender identityand expose trans persons to emotional vulnerability duringthe delicate course of their transition path. Psychologists andpsychotherapists should help GD patients to integrate traumaticmemories in order to enhance their resilience and comfort intheir gender identity expression. Professionals should be trainedin and informed on GD and its traumatic correlates in orderto offer patients and families qualified and ethical support.Furthermore, knowledge on GD should be improved amongfamilies, schools and communities in order to promote socialacceptance, reduce stigma and defend against dangerous riskfactors for trans persons’ psychological wellbeing. This need isparticularly urgent in Italy, where knowledge and information onGD seem very scarce in many contexts (Fisher et al., 2016).The present study is not without limitations. First, the samplesize was relatively small and thus generalization of the resultsshould be made with caution; however, small sample sizes arecommon in Italian studies with GD patients (the number ofreferrals in Italian gender clinics is much smaller than that ofother European nations or the United States). Second, findingsshould be generalized cautiously also by reason of the lack of acontrol group paired for age, numerosity and education. Finally,in this study, trauma history was assessed with the clinician-report ComplexTQ, as applied to AAI transcripts; therefore,trauma was not evaluated from the attachment measure throughan independent source. However, as Bailey et al. (2007) claim,AAI can elicit more reports of physical abuse than othertrauma interviews, because it frames questions about adversitywithin the broader context of childhood familial experiences andrelationships, facilitating the recall of more elusive traumaticforms such as neglect or emotional abuse. Future research shouldseek to expand these findings in studies with paired controlsamples and in longitudinal designs that assess individuals duringthe course of gender transitions, prior and after hormone therapyand gender reassignment surgery. Research on early traumaticexperiences and mental states with regard to attachment ingender variant individuals should benefit also of studies thatassess trauma and attachment from independent sources.As mentioned above, the aim of the study was not tocapture the causal relationships between trauma, attachmentand GD. Rather, we considered both trauma and GD multi-dimensional constructs requiring no reductive or short-sightedattempts at explanation. Further research, however – likely usinglongitudinal designs – might explore more deeply the influenceof early traumatic experiences and disorganized attachmentrepresentations on the development of a non-conforming genderidentity.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSGG: Conception of the work, data collection, data analysisand interpretation, drafting the article.

    "abstract": "The current study investigated attachment representations and complex trauma in a sample of gender dysphoric adults. Although it has been proven that the psychological wellbeing of gender diverse persons is largely mediated by family acceptance and support, research on their relationships with parental figures is scarce. A total of 95 adults took part in the study. The attachment distribution was as follows: 27% secure, 27% insecure and 46% disorganized. Regarding early traumas, 56% experienced four or more traumatic forms. Further, gender dysphoric adults showed significantly higher levels of attachment disorganization and polyvictimisation, relative to controls. Comparisons of subgroups, defined by natal gender, showed that trans women, compared to control males, had more involving and physically and psychologically abusive fathers, and were more often separated from their mothers; trans men, relative to female controls, had more involving mothers and were more frequently separated from and neglected by their fathers. The research has several implications for treatment, clinical health psychology, family support and education",
