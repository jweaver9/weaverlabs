The Effects of Intergroup Contact on Intergroup Anxiety and Transgender Prejudice: An Examination Using Structural Equation Modeling. Yonghong Jade Xu, Ph.D. Background: Evidence suggests that transgender individuals face high levels of prejudice, discrimination, and violence. Despite the known negative impact of transgender prejudice, research is lacking on interventions to reduce transgender prejudice. One possible solution might be found in the intergroup contact theory, which has substantial empirical support as an effective strategy to reduce prejudice across diverse populations and situations.   Aims: The present study, sought to apply the intergroup contact theory to the study of transgender prejudice. First, the study developed and pilot tested the performance of the Transgender Affect Misattribution Procedure (Transgender AMP), a measure of implicit transgender prejudice. Second, the study examined the direct effects of contact (quality and quantity) on transgender prejudice (explicit and implicit). Lastly, the study explored the mediating role of intergroup anxiety in the relationship between contact and prejudice. Method: First, to develop and test the performance of the Transgender AMP, a three-part study was conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (Study 1). Second, an online MTurk sample of 354 individuals completed an online survey for the main study (Study 2). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) procedures were used for analysis of the survey data. Findings: The Transgender AMP performed as expected and its scores demonstrated preliminary evidence of validity and reliability. Quantity of contact had a unique inverse association with implicit transgender prejudice, whereas quality of contact had a unique inverse relationship with both explicit and implicit transgender prejudice. Intergroup anxiety mediated the relationships between quality of contact and implicit and explicit transgender prejudice, but not quantity of contact and implicit transgender prejudice.   vi Keywords:

Introduction Although the United States has experienced a dramatic increase in the visibility of transgender individuals in recent years, there is substantial evidence to suggest that this population continues to face high levels of prejudice, discrimination and violence associated with their gender identity and expression (APA, 2015, Bryan & Schilt, 2008; Grant, Mottet, & Tanis, 2011; Lombardi, 2009). In addition, there is ample documentation that transgender individuals suffer from a variety of mental health consequences as a result of these experiences (e.g., Bockting, Miner, Swinburne, Hamilton, & Coleman, 2013). Given this dire reality, some work has been done to better understand the nature and causes of transgender prejudice, and factors such as religious fundamentalism, LGB prejudice, and political conservatism have been consistently linked to transgender prejudice (e.g., Elischberger et al., 2016; Grigoropoulos & Kordoutis, 2015; Tebbe & Moradi, 2012). At the same time, little research exists on interventions to reduce this form of  prejudice despite its prevalence and known negative impact on transgender individuals. The intergroup contact theory (Alloport, 1954), which proposes that associations between two dissimilar groups may lead to a reduction in prejudice held by members of the in-group towards members of the out-group, has garnered substantial interest and empirical support as an effective strategy to reduce prejudice across diverse populations, particularly related to prejudice against differing racial and ethnic groups, religions, and sexual orientations (e.g., Binder et al., 2009; Islam & Hewstone, 1993; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006; Smith, Axelton, & Saucier, 2009). In fact, in a meta-analysis of 713 independent samples from 515 empirical studies, Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) found that intergroup contact effects (i.e., intergroup contact’s association with   2 prejudice reduction) generalized to entire out-groups (e.g., the population of African Americans, not just the individuals involved in the interaction), across situations, and even to out-groups not directly involved in the contact situation. Notwithstanding its widespread empirical support, however, limited work has examined the application of the intergroup contact theory in the context of transgender prejudice, and much of the available work is beset with methodological shortcomings (e.g., use of single-item contact measures as part of a demographics questionnaire) that potentially undermine the interpretations of the findings (e.g., Flores, 2015; Grigoropoulos & Kordoutis, 2015).  Purpose of Study In light of the promising body of literature showing the potential effectiveness of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice and the limitations of previous studies, the present study sought to apply the intergroup contact theory to the study of transgender prejudice. Specifically, the purposes of the present study were to examine the direct effects of the differing dimensions of contact (quality vs. quantity) on both implicit and explicit transgender prejudice and to explore the possible mediating role of intergroup anxiety in the relationship between contact and transgender prejudice. Due to the lack of an appropriate implicit transgender prejudice measure, we first developed and evaluated the performance of the Transgender Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) (Study 1) for use in pursuing the main objectives of the study (Study 2). Significance of Study Given the reality of discrimination and the associated psychological consequences suffered by transgender individuals in society, the application of the intergroup contact theory to the study of transgender prejudice is important in that it could yield findings that hold significant public health, social, and educational implications. Specifically, a more developed understanding   3 of (a) the effects of quality vs. quantity of contact on implicit and explicit transgender prejudice and (b) the possible underlying mechanism of how contact reduces transgender prejudice would serve to inform the formulation of more effective interventions to reduce prejudice against transgender persons across various societal domains, including healthcare, employment, and education. Organization of the Dissertation  As this work takes the form of a two-manuscript dissertation, it is organized in the following manner. The brief introduction of Chapter 1 is followed by Chapter 2, presenting a summary of the relevant literature. Chapter 3 reports on Study 1, the development and pilot testing of the implicit transgender prejudice measure (Transgender AMP) developed for use in Study 2. Chapter 4 reports on Study 2, which examined the effects of intergroup contact on transgender prejudice and the mediating role of intergroup anxiety in the relationship between intergroup contact and transgender prejudice. Chapter 5 presents a brief conclusion related to Chapters 3 and 4 to complete the dissertation.     4 Chapter 2 Summary of the Literature This chapter presents a summary of background information, including definition of terms, in order to establish and support the rationale, purpose and significance of the present study.  Defining of Terms  Although consensus has not been achieved, there are similar and commonly utilized definitions of the term transgender. According to recently published guidelines for work with transgender and gender nonconforming clients by the American Psychological Association (APA) (2015), transgender individuals are defined as “…those who have a gender identity that is not fully aligned with their sex assigned at birth.” (p.832). Walch and colleagues (2012a) similarly defined transgender persons as “…those whose gender identity (sense of oneself as a man or a woman) or gender expression (expression of oneself as male or female in behavior, manner, and/or dress) differs from conventional expectations for their physical sex” (p. 1286). A broader definition of the term transgender also utilized is “…an umbrella term that refers to all identities or practices that cross over, cut across, move between or otherwise queer socially constructed sex/gender boundaries” (Stryker, 2006, p. 251). For the purpose of this study, the definition provided by APA (2015) was utilized. The term cisgender, on the other hand, is used to refer to “…individuals whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth,” and this term and definition were used throughout the current study (Barbir et al., 2017).  As this study concerns prejudice towards transgender persons, it is also important to identify and define terms in the literature that are related to this from of prejudice. To date, a variety of terms, including transgender prejudice, transprejudice, transphobia, and anti-  5 transgender prejudice have been used to describe an overall negative evaluation of and unfavorable, and at times hostile, attitudes toward transgender individuals (Hill & Willoughby, 2005; Nagoshi et al., 2008; Nisley, 2010; Walch et al., 2012a). Hill and Willoughby (2005), who developed a widely used measure of transgender prejudice (Genderism and Transphobia Scale; GTS), used the term, transphobia, and defined it as “…an emotional disgust toward individuals who do not conform to society’s gender expectations,” specifically involving “the feeling of revulsion to masculine women, feminine men, cross-dressers, transgenderists, and/or transsexuals” (p. 533). They also included genderism (“an ideology that reinforces the negative evaluation of gender non-conformity or an incongruence between sex and gender”) as part of their definition of transgender prejudice (p.534). On the other hand, Walch et al. (2012a) defined transgender prejudice as an adoption of stigma targeted toward transgender people, which includes both cognitive evaluations of and affective reactions to transgender persons. Nagoshi and colleagues (2008) view transphobia as attitudes specifically aimed at “the fluidity of gender identity and how deviations from expected heteronormative manifestations of gender identity fundamentally challenge individuals’ sense of self” (p. 523). Although the term transphobia is commonly used in the literature, given that the term does not actually refer exclusively to a fear response in the sense of a phobia, but rather encompasses a broader range of negative cognitive and affective evaluations and responses aimed at transgender persons, the term transgender prejudice was used in the present study. Prevalence of Transgender Prejudice, Discrimination, and Violence Although attitudes surrounding the transgender population have been documented to be increasingly more affirming over the years, there is evidence to suggest that transgender prejudice continues to exist in the United States. For example, in the first study examining   6 American heterosexual adults’ attitudes toward transgender people in a national probability sample (n = 2,281), Norton and Herek (2013) found participants’ attitudes toward transgender persons to be well below the neutral point (at 32 points on a 100-point scale), suggesting the enduring reality of transgender prejudice among the U.S. adult population. Moreover, several studies comparing attitudes toward transgender persons and sexual minorities in the United States found public attitudes to be significantly more negative toward transgender individuals compared to those toward sexual minorities, highlighting the unique plight of transgender individuals as members of a highly stigmatized group (Lewis et al., 2017; Nagoshi et al., 2008, Norton & Herek, 2013).  In addition to being targets of prejudice, transgender individuals also face overt discrimination and violence. According to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, 10% of transgender persons who are out to their immediate family reported experiences of violence by a family member and 8% reported being kicked out of the house due to their transgender identity (James et al., 2015). In the same survey, 54% of the sample reported experiences of verbal harassment, 24% of physical assault, and 13% of sexual violence in K-12 settings; and 17% reported leaving school due to severe harassment. Similarly, within their sample of transgender-identified persons, James et al. (2015) found the unemployment rate of participants to be three times the rate of the general population, and the number of participants reporting having had to take steps in the past year to avoid workplace mistreatment (such as hiding, delaying gender transition, or leaving their job) was alarmingly high, reported at 77%. Disturbingly, there are also documented reports of transgender patients being denied transgender-related and even routine medical care by healthcare professionals (Grant et al., 2011; Xavier, Bobbin, Singer, & Budd, 2005).    7 There is also sizable documentation that transgender individuals suffer as victims of violence in the forms of sexual abuse (e.g., Bradford, Reisner, Honnold & Xavier, 2013; Clements-Nolle, Marx, Guzman, & Katz, 2006; Kenagy, 2005a, 2005b; Risser et al., 2005), physical abuse (e.g., Bradford et al., 2013; Kenagy & Bostwick, 2005; Lombardi et al., 2001), and verbal abuse (e.g., Reback, Simon, Bemis, & Gatson, 2001). Notably, one line of research has found that gender identity-motivated violence increases distress in victims to a much greater degree than non-gender identity-motivated violence (Hendricks & Testa, 2012). This suggests that transgender persons suffer from significantly higher levels of distress compared to their non-transgender counterparts. Mental Health Consequences of Prejudice, Discrimination, and Violence Not surprisingly, transgender individuals experience a variety of negative mental health consequences associated with their experiences of prejudice, discrimination and violence. Specifically, previous studies have found high rates of depression (e.g., Clements-Nolle, Marx, Guzman, & Katz, 2001), anxiety (e.g., Bockting et al., 2013), substance abuse (e.g., Xavier et al., 2005), and suicidality (e.g., Haas, Rodgers, & Herman, 2014) among the transgender population. In fact, the rate of actual suicide attempts among transgender individuals is alarmingly high, reported at 41% in contrast to 4% in the overall population, with some scholars suggesting transgender prejudice as a particularly important factor in understanding these elevated rates of psychological distress and suicidality among the transgender population (Bockting et al., 2005; Clements-Nolle et al., 2005; Haas et al., 2014; James et al., 2015). Given the ongoing reality of prejudice, discrimination, and their consequent detrimental effects suffered by transgender individuals, serious considerations of strategies to reduce prejudice against this population are warranted.   8 Predictors and Causes of Prejudice Within the field of social psychology, considerable effort has been invested in identifying and understanding causes of prejudice. Gordon Allport (1954) presented a framework suggesting five broad categories of antecedents of intergroup prejudice: 1) sociocultural (e.g., cultural values and traditions, competition for resources, social class differentials), 2) historical (e.g., history of intergroup conflict), 3) personality (e.g., mistrustful, intolerance of ambiguity, authoritarian), 4) situational (e.g., status difference in contact setting, location of interaction, salience of group categories), and 5) experiential/phenomenological (e.g., perception and experience of immediate situation). According to Allport (1954), patterns of prejudice are best understood from a historical point of view, often rooted in social contexts and cultural values of those involved, influenced by the immediate contact situation, and fueled or exacerbated by individual personality traits and perceptions of the situation and individuals involved. A large body of literature provides support for Allport’s theory on antecedents of prejudice within the contexts of prejudice against racial and religious minorities as well as immigrants, women, and sexual minorities (e.g., Coenders, Lubbers, Scheepers, & Verkuyten, 2008; Tam, Hewstone, Kenworthy, & Cairns, 2008; Whitley & Egisdottir, 2000; Zick, Wolf, Kupper, Davidov, Heitmeyer, & Schmidt, 2008).  Within transgender attitudes research, several factors have been consistently linked to transgender prejudice, some of which align with the antecedents of prejudice suggested by Allport. First, across multiple studies, men have been found to demonstrate greater levels of transgender prejudice than women (Grigoropoulos & Kordoutis, 2015; Hill & Willoughby, 2005; Nagoshi et al., 2008; Norton & Herek, 2013; Tebbe & Moradi, 2012; Tee & Hegarty, 2006; Walch et al., 2012a; Willoughby et al., 2010). Some researchers have postulated that this   9 difference may be due to men being more invested than women in maintaining traditional gender norms, who may, as a result, perceive transgender individuals as a threat to the existing social structure and their identity as men (Herek, 1986; Hill & Willoughby, 2013; Norton & Herek, 2013). This assessment fits within Allport’s framework (i.e., sociocultural antecedents) and specifically with the literature on social dominance orientation and integrated threat theory, which show commitment to maintaining existing social beliefs/practices and perceived threats to ingroup identity as underlying factors of prejudice toward groups posing the threat (Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle 1994; Renfro, Duran, Stephan, & Clason, 2006; Stephan, 2008; Stephan, 2014). In this light, it is plausible that it is not gender per se, but rather certain social values and cognitive orientations of men that may be the basis of transgender prejudice. Second, greater reported religiosity and religious fundamentalism have also been found to be associated with  more negative attitudes toward transgender individuals (Cragun & Sumerau, 2015; Elischberger, Glazier, Hill, & Verduzco-Baker, 2016; Flores, 2015; Grigoropoulos & Kordoutis, 2015; Nagoshi et al., 2008; Norton & Herek, 2013; Riggs & Bartholomaeus, 2016; Tee & Hegarty, 2006; Watjen & Mitchell, 2013). These findings align with the social psychological literature, which provide support for the connection between these related constructs and a variety of prejudices (e.g., sexism, racism, anti-Semitism), with more recent work also offering evidence for the causal effect of religious beliefs on prejudice particularly toward value-violating outgroups (e.g., Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 1992; Whitley & Bernard, 1999; Johnson, Rowatt, & LaBouff, 2010). Of note, some research has found that components of both religious fundamentalism (a tendency toward exclusionary and dogmatic thinking) and right-wing authoritarianism (see below paragraph) mediate the relationship between religiosity and prejudice, suggesting that cognitively rigid ideologies may be responsible for the apparent   10 religiosity-prejudice association identified in previous research (e.g., Johnson et al., 2011; Stefurak, Taylor, & Mehta, 2010). Finally, higher levels of transgender prejudice have been identified in those with greater political conservatism and right-wing-authoritarianism (Elischberger et al., 2016; Grigoropoulos & Kordoutis, 2015; Nagoshi et al., 2008; Norton & Herek, 2013; Silveira & Goff, 2016; Tee & Hegarty, 2006). In these studies, greater political conservatism was described in terms of submission to government authority, conformity to social order and tradition, and avoidance of uncertainty; right-wing authoritarianism assessed tendencies toward rigid/black and white thinking, obedience to authority, and adherence to social rules. These findings parallel those on religious fundamentalism and provide additional support that certain cognitive styles may underlie a predisposition toward prejudicial attitudes. Although these antecedents of transgender prejudice are largely individual characteristics that are, arguably, not readily changeable, the persisting prejudice and their known damaging effects on transgender individuals demand considerations of strategies to curtail prejudice against this population. Intergroup Contact Theory and Prejudice Reduction The intergroup contact theory has garnered much interest and has been widely studied by social psychologists over the years as a means of prejudice reduction. Originally introduced by Gordon Alloport (1954) as the contact hypothesis, this theory proposes that associations between members of differing social groups, termed ingroup and outgroup (where ingroup refers to members belonging to a given group based on a specific category, such as race; and outgroup refers to those who do not belong to the ingroup based on the specified category), may lead to a reduction in prejudice held by members of the ingroup towards members of the outgroup. More specifically, Allport (1954) theorized that prejudice reduction is most likely to occur under   11 certain conditions (which have been viewed as representing quality aspects of contact in subsequent studies): when interacting groups or individuals (1) perceive equal status within the situation, (2) are involved in a goal-oriented effort, (3) share a sense of cooperation, and (4) perceive a sense of social sanction and support from authority. Since its introduction, the intergroup contact theory has been applied to and empirically tested in diverse populations (e.g., differing racial/ethnic groups, religions, (dis)abilities, and sexual minorities), which has produced an extensive body of literature in support of the theory (e.g., Barr & Bracchitta, 2012; Bohmert, Northcurr, & DeMaris, 2015; Kanas, Scheepers, & Sterkens, 2015).  Despite the widespread empirical support of the intergroup contact theory, there is limited work that examines the application of this theory in the context of transgender attitudes and prejudice. To date, few transgender attitudes studies have included a contact variable (e.g., Acker, 2017; Barbir et al., 2017; Bowers et al., 2015; Elischberger et al., 2016; Flores, 2015; Gazzola & Morrison, 2014; Grigoropolous & Kordoutis, 2015; Hill & Willoughby, 2005; Nisley, 2010; Tee & Hegarty, 2006; Willoughby et al., 2010), of which only some expressly tested the link between intergroup contact and transgender prejudice (e.g., Tadlock et al., 2017; Walch et al., 2012b). At the same time, findings within this small body of transgender literature appear to generally correspond to that of the broader empirical literature on intergroup contact, showing contact with transgender individuals as positively relating to prejudice reduction.  In fact, in one of the most methodologically robust studies, Walch and colleagues (2012b) found that intergroup contact led to significant transgender prejudice reduction. In the study, the researchers tested the effects of a contact intervention by randomly assigning a group of students to one of two conditions: (a) a transgender speaker panel presentation followed by a lecture presentation or (b) a lecture presentation followed by a transgender speaker panel   12 presentation. The students were assessed for levels of transgender prejudice at four time points (baseline, immediately following speaker panel presentation, immediately following lecture presentation, and 3 weeks post completion of intervention components). The results of the study showed that the transgender speaker panel first condition showed greater immediate reduction in prejudice compared to the lecture first condition, with further prejudice reduction found only with the addition of the speaker panel following the lecture, demonstrating the causal effect and the importance of intergroup contact (over and above mere information) on transgender prejudice reduction. At the same time, there have been mixed findings in the broader literature concerning the quantity and quality of contact and their associations with prejudice reduction. Whereas some studies have found only quality of contact (and not frequency of contact) as positively relating to prejudice reduction (e.g., Islam & Hewstone, 1993; Schwartz & Simmons, 2001; Stephan, Diaz-Loving, & Duran, 2000) or quality of contact rather than quantity of contact being the better predictor of prejudice reduction (e.g., Binder et al., 2009), others have reported a positive relationship between frequent exposure to outgroup members (quantity of contact) and prejudice reduction (e.g., Bornstein, 1989; Harmon-Jones & Allen, 2001; Lee, 2001; Rhodes, Halberstadt & Brajkovich, 2001). Additionally, a study examining attitudes toward individuals with intellectual and developmental disability has further extended support for the importance of quality over quantity of contact in its report that, when controlling for quality of contact, greater quantity of contact was either not associated with prejudice or was associated with heightened prejudice (Keith, Bennetto & Rogge, 2015). Although, overall, there is more evidence in support for quality of contact as being a better predictor of prejudice reduction than quantity of contact (e.g., Binder et al., 2009), findings within the contact literature remain mixed (e.g., Rhodes et al.,   13 2001). These varied findings may be due to vastly different samples and variability in the measures used, suggesting a need for methodological improvement to gain clearer understanding of the link between differing dimensions of contact and prejudice reduction. Furthermore, the lack of systematic distinction between quantity and quality of contact throughout the transgender prejudice literature, coupled with the methodological limitations of existing studies (e.g., use of one-item contact measures, vague and inconsistent language concerning contact, and varied operationalization of prejudice measures across studies), highlight a need for an exploration of the relationships between quantity and quality of contact with transgender prejudice to gain more accurate understanding. Implicit and Explicit Prejudice In recent years, an increasing number of studies have examined prejudicial attitudes toward transgender individuals (e.g., Barbir et al., 2017; Elischberger et al., 2016; Flores, 2015; Kanamori, Pegors, Hulgus, & Cornelius-White, 2017; Nisely, 2010; Tee & Hegarty, 2006; Willoughby et al., 2010). Although these studies have provided useful information and insight, a key limitation has been that they have focused almost exclusively on the examination of explicit prejudice using self-report measures. One major concern within the field of attitudes studies has been that the examination of explicit prejudice alone may not provide a complete picture of underlying biases due to its inability to assess more subtle forms of bias that individuals may not be fully aware of or willing to openly disclose (Gawronski & Payne, 2010; Greenwald & Banaji, 1995). Likewise, research has shown that self-report measures may be susceptible to social desirability and motivational bias (Gawronski & Payne, 2010; Sherman, Gawronski & Trope, 2014), especially in studies related to socially sensitive topics, such as intergroup prejudice (Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, & Banaji, 2009; Nosek, Greenwald & Banaji, 2007).   14 Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that implicit prejudice and explicit prejudice are related but separate constructs, which differentially predict discriminatory behaviors and intentions (e.g., Akrami, Ekehammar, Claesson, & Sonnander, 2006; Keith et al., 2015). For example, several studies have shown that whereas explicit prejudice predicts overt discriminatory behaviors, implicit prejudice predicts more subtle social behaviors, such as averting eye contact and nervous gestures in intergroup contact situations (e.g., Cameron, Brown-Iannuzzi, & Payne, 2012; Dovidio, Kawakami, & Gaertner, 2002; Imhoff & Banse, 2011; Payne, Govorun, & Arbuckle, 2008; Payne et al., 2010). Additionally, the explicit-implicit construct differentiation was supported by factor analysis in the only existing study examining U.S. adults’ explicit and implicit attitudes toward transsexual men and women (Wang-Jones, Alhassoon, Hattrup, Ferdman, & Lowman, 2017). In light of the findings suggesting the vulnerability of self-report measures to social desirability and evidence that implicit and explicit attitudes are distinct constructs that predict different types of behaviors and outcomes, it would be useful and important to distinguish and assess both explicit and implicit aspects of transgender prejudice to extend knowledge and understanding in this area. The importance of the distinction between implicit and explicit prejudice is one that has also been increasingly acknowledged in the intergroup contact literature. More recently, studies within this field have examined the associations between intergroup contact and implicit and explicit prejudice separately, with some studies also distinguishing between quality and quantity of contact (e.g., Qian, Heyman, Quinn, Fu, & Lee, 2017; Turner, Voci & Hewstone, 2007; Žeželj, Jakšić & Jošić, 2015). Although a few findings are conflicting, the overall pattern of findings suggest that quality of contact predicts explicit prejudice, whereas quantity of contact predicts implicit prejudice. In other words, studies have found that greater quality of contact with   15 outgroup members is associated with lower explicit prejudice toward the outgroup, whereas more frequent contact with outgroup members is associated with lower levels of implicit, more automatic forms of prejudice toward the outgroup. As an example, in a longitudinal study examining various medical school factors predictive of changes in sexual prejudice among graduating medical students, Phelan and colleagues (2017) found that medical students’ quality of contact with sexual minorities predicted lower levels of self-reported negative attitudes toward members of that outgroup, whereas the amount of contact predicted lower levels of negative implicit attitudes toward sexual minorities at the end of their medical school training. The apparent trajectory of findings demonstrating differential associations between the two dimensions of contact and the two types of prejudice point to the complex interrelations between contact and prejudice, which would be important to explore within the context of transgender prejudice.  Underlying Mechanism of Intergroup Contact and Prejudice Reduction  Theories building upon Allport’s intergroup contact theory have been developed in an effort to explain the mechanisms through which contact reduces prejudice. Given the potential policy implications of the intergroup contact effect, understanding the underlying mechanism of the intergroup contact theory is worthwhile in helping to maximize the established effect. In other words, understanding not only that intergroup contact reduces prejudice, but how it reduces prejudice can help inform more focal and effective contact strategies to reduce transgender prejudice.   One explanatory factor that has been identified and studied is intergroup anxiety. In their seminal work, Stephan and Stephan (1985) postulated that contact with outgroup members reduces prejudice via intergroup anxiety. More specifically, they suggested that intergroup   16 anxiety stems primarily from an anticipation of detrimental consequences to the self during contact, which results in information processing bias (such as narrowed focus of attention and increase in simplified and expectancy-confirming processing), which sustains existing prejudice. According to their theory, interaction between ingroup and outgroup members reduces this intergroup anxiety, which in turn reduces prejudice.  Models testing the mediating role of intergroup anxiety have been empirically supported in studies with a variety of target outgroups, including Hindus and Muslims (Islam & Hewstone, 1993), British and Japanese nationals (Greenland & Brown, 1999), and Americans and Mexicans (Stephan et al., 2000). In fact, in a meta-analysis of the three most studied mediators of intergroup contact and prejudice, intergroup anxiety was found as a much stronger mediator than either knowledge or empathy and perspective-taking (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). Although most of the mediation studies to date have examined the intergroup anxiety model in the context of explicit prejudice, several of the more recent studies have examined both explicit and implicit prejudice, with some also making a distinction between quality and quantity of contact. Largely paralleling findings from earlier literature, recent work also indicates that intergroup anxiety is a significant explanatory variable, particularly in the relationship between quality of contact and explicit prejudice (e.g., Keith et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2007; Žeželj et al., 2015). On the other hand, whether intergroup anxiety similarly mediates the relationships between (a) quality of contact and implicit prejudice, (b) quantity of contact and explicit prejudice, and/or (c) quantity of contact and implicit prejudice remains unclear. This may partially be due to the divergent target groups, differences in the measures used to assess both the predictor and criterion variables, as well as the variability in model complexity across studies. These studies together   17 suggest the need for testing this previously unexamined mediation model in the context of transgender prejudice, which would serve to inform both theory and practice. Research Questions and Hypotheses Taken together, findings from the above literature review suggest a need for the application of the intergroup contact theory to the study of transgender prejudice. More specifically, the literature points to the need for examining an integrative model in which (a) the direct effects of the differing dimensions of contact (quality vs. quantity) on transgender prejudice (implicit and explicit) and (b) the mediating role of intergroup anxiety in  the relationship between both dimensions of contact and both types of transgender prejudice are tested. Thus, the current study addressed the following research questions and related hypotheses:  With regard to prejudice towards transgender persons within the general U.S. population: • RQ1. How does quantity of contact with transgender persons impact prejudice? o H1. Quantity of contact will have a negative, direct effect on implicit prejudice, such that greater quantity of contact will be associated with less implicit prejudice. • RQ2. How does quality of contact with transgender persons impact prejudice?  o H2. Quality of contact will have a negative, direct effect on explicit prejudice, such that greater quality of contact will be associated with less explicit prejudice. • RQ3. How does intergroup anxiety mediate the effect of contact with transgender persons on prejudice?   18 o H3. Intergroup anxiety will mediate the effect of quality of contact on explicit prejudice, such that greater quality of contact will be associated with less intergroup anxiety, which in turn will be associated with less explicit prejudice.     19 Chapter 3 Manuscript 1: Transgender Affect Misattribution Procedure (Transgender AMP): Development and Evaluation of Initial Performance of a Measure of Implicit Prejudice Due to the lack of an appropriate existing instrument, Study 1 developed a measure of implicit transgender prejudice for use in Study 2. Below is a manuscript detailing the development and evaluation of the Transgender Affect Misattribution Procedure (Transgender AMP).  Introduction Decades of social attitudes research has shown the importance of examining both explicit and implicit attitudes for a more complete understanding of attitudes toward any given attitude object (e.g., Ajzen & Fishbein, 2005; Fazio & Olson, 2003; Gawronski & Payne, 2010; Greenwald & Banaji, 1995). Within bias research, the terms “explicit” and “implicit” refer to both construct and method of measurement (e.g., Greenwald & Banaji, 1995). “Implicit,” as a method of measurement refers to the process of obtaining information indirectly (i.e., gathering data without directly asking participants about the topic of interest). “Explicit,” as a method of measurement, on the other hand, refers to the process of acquiring information by directly asking questions about the topic of interest. As a construct, the term “implicit” describes an automatic (i.e., unintentional) mental process that is outside of one’s control, whereas “explicit” describes a conscious (i.e., intentional) mental process that is within one’s control (Greenwald & Banaji, 1995). Although early bias research focused primarily on explicit prejudice, researchers have increasingly advocated for the need to examine implicit attitudes in addition to explicit attitudes based on consistent findings across diverse studies indicating that explicit attitudes are susceptible to social desirability, particularly when considering socially sensitive topics (Devine,   20 1998; Dovidio & Gaertner, 2004; Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, & Banaji, 2009). Likewise, there is evidence to suggest that implicit attitudes tap subtler forms of bias that individuals may not even be aware of, which explicit self-report measures are incapable of assessing (e.g., Akrami, Ekehammar, Claesson & Sonnander, 2006; Gawronski & Payne, 2010; Greenwald & Banaji, 1995). Finally, recent studies have also shown that implicit and explicit prejudice differentially predict various behavioral intentions and outcomes, with some studies suggesting that implicit prejudice is associated with less friendly mannerisms, such as lack of eye contact and nervous gestures (e.g., Cameron, Brown-Iannuzzi, & Payne, 2012; Dovidio, Kawakami, & Gaertner, 2002; Imhoff & Banse, 2011; Payne, Govorun, & Arbuckle, 2008; Payne et al., 2010). Taken together, the social attitudes literature supports the need for the examination of both implicit and explicit attitudes.  Within transgender attitudes research, the focus thus far has been almost exclusively on explicit transgender prejudice using self-report measures. Hill and Willoughby (2005), who developed one of the first and widely used measures of transgender prejudice (Genderism and Transphobia Scale; GTS), define the construct as the extent to which an individual feels discomfort with or is prejudiced toward those who identify as transgender. Importantly, transgender prejudice is a separate construct from sexual prejudice (also known as homophobia; Weinberg, 1972), designating prejudice directed at those who deviate from conventional gender identities, not sexual orientation as in the case of sexual prejudice (Nagoshi, Adams, Terrell, Hill, Brzuzy, & Nagoshi, 2008). To date, studies have demonstrated the on-going existence of transgender prejudice in the United States with evidence of greater levels of transgender prejudice as compared to sexual prejudice, underscoring the unique plight of transgender persons as members of a highly stigmatized group (e.g., Lewis et al., 2017; Norton & Herek, 2013).   21 Moreover, the existing body of transgender attitudes literature has identified several consistent correlates and predictors of transgender prejudice—including gender, religiosity, and political conservatism—providing important insight into the prevalence and nature of transgender prejudice in the United States (e.g., Flores, 2015; Nagoshi et al., 2008; Tebbe & Moradi, 2012). At the same time, research into the implicit aspect of transgender prejudice is lacking, due in large part, to the scarcity of implicit transgender prejudice measures. Evidence from the broader prejudice literature (as outlined above), particularly concerning the ability of implicit prejudice to predict subtle but socially consequential behaviors not predicted by explicit prejudice, highlights the value of examining both explicit and implicit transgender prejudice. The purpose of the present study, therefore, was (a) to build a standardized procedure to assess implicit transgender prejudice and (b) to pilot test the performance of the newly developed procedure.  One of the most widely used measures of implicit attitudes is the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), which uses reaction time differentials as a measure of individuals’ automatic preferences. More specifically, a commonly used IAT design assesses an individual’s preference of one target group over another based on response time latency in relating positive vs. negative words with each of the two target groups. Although this procedure is one of the oldest and most widely used measure of implicit attitudes, and has been recently modified to assess implicit attitudes toward transsexual men and women (GI-IAT; Wang-Jones, Alhassoon, Hattrup, Ferdman, & Lowman, 2017), several critiques exist. First, the original IAT (Greenwald et al., 1998) is limited to providing a relative preference of one target over another, and thus cannot be used to assess implicit attitudes toward one target object/group (Payne & Lundberg, 2014). While several variants of the original design have been developed, such that it can assess associations of a single target (e.g., Single Category IAT, Karpinski &   22 Steinman, 2006; Single Attribute IAT, Penke, Eichstaedt, & Asendorpf, 2006), limitations associated with its complex procedure and reliance on response time, which are described next, remain. Second, the IAT requires a dual task-structure with many phases, which makes it a complex procedure. Third, since it assesses implicit attitudes based on response time, it suffers from large variability in results, which, some suggest, may indicate that IAT scores actually reflect factors other than implicit attitudes, such as cultural norms (Karpinski & Hilton, 2001), concept similarities (De Houwer, Geldof, & De Bruycker, 2005), and task-switching ability (Klauer & Mierke, 2005).   To address some of the existing critiques of the IAT, the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP; Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005) was developed and has been increasingly used as an alternative to the IAT. The AMP utilizes the logic of projective tests and priming effects to measure automatic and unintentional attitudes by examining the unconscious influence of a prime stimulus on an individual’s evaluation of a neutral target. More specifically, in the AMP, participants are briefly presented with a prime stimulus (attitude object), which is followed by a presentation of a neutral Chinese character (judgment target). The Chinese character is then replaced by a black-and-white pattern mask to disrupt after images, and the participants are asked to evaluate the Chinese character in terms of its visual pleasantness. When participants are presented with a positively valenced stimulus, they tend to rate the Chinese character as being more pleasant; in contrast, when participants are presented with a negatively valenced stimulus, they tend to rate the Chinese character as being less pleasant. Thus, participants’ misattribution of their affective reactions from the primes to the Chinese characters serves as a measure of their implicit attitudes toward the prime (attitude object) (See Payne & Lundberg, 2014 for a detailed explanation of the underlying mechanism of AMP). In this way, the AMP, unlike the IAT, is a   23 simple procedure that allows for an evaluation of one attitude object without relying upon response time. As a highly flexible technique, the AMP has been successfully adapted to examine a wide range of implicit attitudes, including racial prejudice (Imhoff & Banse, 2009; Payne et al., 2005), eating behavior (Hofmann, van Koningsbruggen, Stroebe, Ramanathan, & Aarts, 2010), alcohol use (Payne et al., 2008), and sexual preference (Imhoff, Schmidt, Bernhardt, Dierksmeier, & Banse, 2011). Given these improvements of the AMP over the IAT and its demonstrated use as a measure of implicit prejudice towards a variety of target objects and groups, the present study modified the original AMP to build an analogous procedure to assess implicit transgender prejudice (Transgender AMP).  Our goal is for the Transgender AMP, as an implicit measure specifically of transgender prejudice and potentially psychometrically superior to the IAT, to provide researchers with a better tool to assess a construct previously largely unexamined. Further, given what is known from the broader social attitudes research on implicit and explicit attitudes, future research into the implicit aspect of transgender prejudice will likely offer valuable information that could inform more effective intervention and advocacy strategies to reduce transgender prejudice and discrimination.   Overview of the Present Study To build the Transgender AMP, a three-part online study was conducted. Part one consisted of a brief word sort task to select the transgender word primes for the Transgender AMP. Part two consisted of an administration of an abbreviated AMP to test the feasibility of test features—including clarity of instructions, ease of keyboard response selection, and usefulness of sample trials. Part three consisted of pilot testing the newly built procedure to assess its performance.   24 Part One: Selecting Transgender Word Primes The purpose of the word sort task was to select transgender word primes for the Transgender AMP. As we cannot assume that the general population is familiar with transgender terms, this task was necessary to identify terms readily categorized as transgender-related terms by the lay population.  Method Participants. The word sort task was completed by a pool of 30 participants, consisting of 60% cisgender men and 40% cisgender women with a mean age of 35.87 (SD = 9.49; range = 22 - 54 years). Of the participants, 76.7% identified as White, 90% identified as heterosexual, and approximately 50% reported holding at least a bachelor’s degree. With regard to knowing a transgender person, 60% reported not knowing anyone who identifies as transgender.  Procedure. After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). MTurk is an online workforce of roughly 500,000 people, widely used by social scientists to recruit study participants and has been shown to provide samples that are equal or greater in diversity to other non-random sampling methods (e.g., Clifford, Jewell, & Waggoner, 2015). Participation was restricted to adults (age > 18 years) residing in the United States with a “HIT approval rating” above 97% (an indicator of the professionalism of participants to complete surveys). Participants were directed from MTurk to Qualtrics, where they completed the word sort task and demographics questions after providing informed consent. Two attention check items were included in the word sort task to safeguard against inattentive respondents (Meade & Craig, 2012).  Word Sort Task. In the word sort task, participants were presented with seven transgender (transgender, transsexual, transgender man, transgender woman, transman,   25 transwoman, and transgendered) and seven non-transgender (male, girl, boy, female, cisgender, student, mother) terms in a randomized order and instructed to classify each term into one of three categories: (a) Transgender, (b) Other, and (c) Not sure. Since the seven transgender terms were selected from the literature with particular attention to familiarity by the general population, they do not necessarily reflect how transgender persons contemporarily refer to themselves (e.g., Bouman et al., 2016). At the end of the task, they were presented with a brief demographics questionnaire, in which they were asked to provide their age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, highest level of education, contact with transgender persons, and their level of knowledge on transgender-related issues. Analysis. Results were analyzed based on the proportion of accurate responses per term (i.e., “transgender” selected as the response category for transgender-related terms). In order to ensure clear familiarity of terms by the general public, we set the inclusion threshold at 95% accuracy in the categorization of transgender terms. In other words, only terms categorized with 95% accuracy were selected as primes to be included in the Transgender AMP.   Results Overall, the accuracy of categorization was high for all seven terms, ranging between 83.3% to 100%. The terms transsexual and transwoman were excluded as the lowest categorized prompts at 83.3% and 93.3% accuracy, failing to meet the 95% threshold. This left us with five terms (transgender, transgender man, transgender woman, transgendered, and transman) as primes to be included in the Transgender AMP with an accurate categorization rate between 96.7% and 100%.   26 Part Two: AMP Procedural Testing In part two, we built and administered an abbreviated AMP consisting of 10 trials to test the feasibility of test features. While a full AMP, as tested in part three below, typically includes 100+ trials, the purpose of this part was to collect Likert type and qualitative data to assess the clarity of instructions, possible challenges concerning response selection using keyboard number keys, and the usefulness of sample trials to inform the building and fine-tuning of the Transgender AMP.  Method Participants. The AMP Procedural Test was completed by a pool of ten participants, consisting of seven cisgender men, two cisgender women, and one gender non-binary individual with a mean age of 37.8 (SD = 13.65; range = 24 – 59 years). Seven identified as White and three identified as Black/African American. One reported holding a master’s degree, six a bachelor’s degree, and three some college.  Procedure. Adult participants (age > 18 years) residing in the United States with a “HIT approval rating” above 97% and who are unfamiliar with Chinese Characters were recruited through MTurk. The restriction regarding Chinese characters were included because the AMP uses ratings of Chinese characters as an indicator of implicit attitudes. Participants were directed from MTurk to Qualtrics, where they were provided with the informed consent and a screening question (“Do you read Chinese characters?”), after which they were directed to the Inquisit Millisecond web platform to complete the abbreviated AMP. Participants ended the study by completing a brief demographics questionnaire in Qualtrics.  AMP Procedural Test. The short version of the AMP was built in Inquisit Millisecond. Participants were first presented with an explanation and instructions for completing the   27 procedure (see Appendix A). They were then instructed to practice their finger placement and response selection using the number keys at the top of their keyboard. Following the finger placement practice round, participants were given a standard warning used in the AMP (see Appendix A), before advancing to complete the practice trial of rating a Chinese character. The participants were then given a finger placement reminder, informed that they would be presented with similar word pairs, and another warning prior to the commencement of the ten trials. At the completion of the task, they were directed back to Qualtrics where they answered questions regarding their experience of completing the online task. Questions pertained to the clarity of instructions (e.g., “I thought the instructions for the online task were clear”), usefulness of finger placement and keyboard response practice (e.g., “I thought the key press practice was useful”), and challenges concerning response selection using keyboard number keys (e.g., “In rating the 10 Chinese characters, I accidentally pressed a response key that was NOT the response I intended”). One open-ended question, “Please provide any additional feedback and/or suggestions you think might help us in fine-tuning features of this online task,” was asked to obtain additional feedback from participants. Questions concerning clarity of instructions and usefulness of practice trials were rated on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree. Questions concerning the ease or challenge of keyboard response selection were rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 1 = 0 times to 4 = more than 5 times. The study concluded with a set of demographics questions concerning age, gender, ethnicity, and highest level of education. Results No a priori thresholds were set for the analysis of results as the instructions and procedures evaluated in the present study were consistent with those successfully used in prior   28 AMP designs (e.g., Payne et al., 2005). Results were thus examined primarily to confirm the clarity and feasibility of existing instructions and procedures. With regards to instructions of the AMP, 100% agreed or strongly agreed with their clarity. Regarding usefulness of key press practice, practice trial, and helpfulness of finger placement reminder before real trial, 70-80% of participants agreed or strongly agreed, suggesting that most participants found the practice rounds and reminders helpful. Concerning ease of locating response keys, 80% of participants agreed or strongly agreed and reported (a) that they did not have to look down at the keyboard to find the response key they wanted and (b) that they did not accidentally press a response key that was not the one they intended on any of the ten trials completed. Likewise, 90% reported they missed no words flashed on the screen as a result of looking down at the keyboard. These results suggest that the response procedures for the AMP are easy to use, given the provided set of instructions. Additionally, no qualitative feedback was provided that indicated a need for change in the existing procedures. Thus, all features from the procedural test were retained in the final form of the Transgender AMP.  Part Three: Transgender AMP Pilot Test The purpose of Part three of the study was to pilot test the performance of the new Transgender AMP.  Method Participants. Participants were seventy adults, consisting of 55.7% cisgender men and 44.3% cisgender women between the ages of 20 and 72 years (Mean = 39.19, SD = 11.42). No participant identified as transgender. The sample was majority White (68.6%), heterosexual (94.3%), and college educated (58.6% reported holding at least a bachelor’s degree) with   29 moderately low levels of contact with transgender and non-binary persons (64.3% reported not knowing anyone who identifies as transgender or non-binary).  Procedure. As before, adults (age > 18 years) residing in the United States with a “HIT approval rating” above 97% were recruited via MTurk. As was the case in Part two, participants were restricted to those unfamiliar with Chinese characters due to their use as judgement targets in the AMP. Participants were directed from MTurk to Qualtrics, where they were provided with the informed consent and a screening question (“Do you read Chinese characters?”), after which they were directed to the Inquisit Millisecond web platform to complete the Transgender AMP. Participants ended the study with a brief demographics questionnaire in Qualtrics, in which they were asked to provide information on their age, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and highest level of education.  Transgender AMP. The Transgender AMP was coded in Inquisit Millisecond, following the protocol presented by Payne et al. (2005) adjusted for word primes (instead of visual primes) as found in Imhoff and Banse (2011) and Payne, Burkley et al. (2008). Stimuli for the Transgender AMP included transgender and neutral primes and ambiguous judgment targets. Transgender primes were five transgender terms identified through the word sort task (transgender, transgender man, transgender woman, transgendered, and transman). Neutral primes were five neutral words (relevant, visible, green, stones, and cable) used in a prior AMP study conducted by Schreiber and colleagues (2012). As this was the first time assessing implicit transgender prejudice using this procedure, neutral primes were included so that their ratings could be used as a baseline against which the transgender prime ratings are evaluated. Ambiguous judgement targets to be rated were 100 Chinese pictographs used in previous AMP designs (Payne et al., 2005).    30 Each trial of the Transgender AMP began with a presentation of a transgender or neutral term as a prime. The prime was presented in the center of the screen for 100ms, followed by a blank screen for 100ms, a Chinese pictograph for 100ms, then a black-and-white pattern mask, which remained on the screen until a response key was pressed (see Figure 1). The pattern mask was shown to disrupt after-images to limit perceptual processing and maximize the ambiguity of the judgment targets (Payne, McClernon, & Dobbins, 2007). The next trial began immediately after participants provided a response, rating the pleasantness of each Chinese pictograph on a 4-point Likert scale (3 = very unpleasant, 4 = slightly unpleasant, 7 = slightly pleasant, 8 = very pleasant). A 4-point rating scale with space between left-hand and right-hand response choices was selected over a binary response choice to increase variance and for ease of finger placement as seen in prior studies (e.g., Hofmann et al., 2010; Payne, Burkley et al., 2008; Schreiber et al., 2012). Based on the recommendations of Payne and Lundberg (2014), the Transgender AMP consisted of 10 blocks of 10 trials each (for a total of 100 trials). In each block, every prime (five transgender and five neutral primes) was presented once, resulting in a total of ten presentations of every prime. A unique Chinese character was randomly paired with each of the ten prime stimuli in each block, resulting in the use of 100 unique characters. One practice trial was given to familiarize the participants with a trial sequence, after which participants completed the100 trials (Payne, Govorun et al., 2008).    31  Figure 1. Diagram of the stimuli sequence for the Transgender AMP Before performing the task, participants were told that the task concerned making quick judgments while avoiding distractions. More specifically, an adaptation of the instructions used in Payne, Govorun et al.’s (2008) experiment 1 and Payne, Burkley et al.’s (2008) study were used in the Transgender AMP. Participants were additionally warned not to let their ratings of the Chinese characters be influenced by the preceding English word, using an adaptation of the explicit warning from Payne et al.’s (2005) experiment 2. As is standard in other AMP designs, the warning was included to ensure that the Transgender AMP responses represent the priming effect, despite efforts to correct, which serves as a measure of implicit attitudes toward the transgender word prime. See Appendix A for the instruction and warning used in the study. Analysis. Following Payne et al. (2005), we assessed the Transgender AMP by comparing the mean responses by prime type and by estimating the internal consistency of scores  (Cronbach’s alpha) as an indicator of score reliability. Additionally, given that males and those with no contact with transgender persons have been consistently found to hold greater explicit transgender prejudice compared to females and persons who have had contact with transgender persons (e.g., Acker, 2017; Barbir et al., 2017; Norton & Herek, 2013; Tebbe & Moradi, 2012),   32 we tested the effects of gender and contact on implicit transgender prejudice to examine whether similar results would be found. All data analyses were conducted in SPSS (v 25.0).  Results Mean performance and effect size estimate. After screening the data for invalid responses and missing values, the raw key stroke responses—3, 4, 7, 8 (see Figure 1)—were first coded into a four-point scale, ranging from 1 – 4. Then for further clarity and ease of interpretation, they were reversely coded so that higher scores indicate greater implicit prejudice. Responses were then scored by computing the mean rating for each prime type—transgender and neutral. We analyzed the ratings using a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), which showed a significant effect of prime type on prejudice rating: F(1, 69) = 6.85, p = .011, p2  = .09. An examination of the means indicated that prejudice ratings were significantly higher for transgender primes (M = 2.49, SD = .47) compared to neutral primes (M = 2.33, SD = .40). Moreover, the estimated effect size ( p2  = .09; 95% CI = .005, .231) indicated a modest priming effect.  Effects of gender and contact on implicit transgender prejudice. We additionally conducted two mixed ANOVAs to separately examine the effects of (1) gender (male vs. female) and (2) contact (contact vs. no contact) on prejudice ratings (prime type: transgender vs. neutral). Means and standard deviations for prejudice ratings are presented in Table 1, broken down by gender and contact, respectively.   33 Table 1 Descriptive statistics of prejudice ratings by gender and contact   Gender   Contact with Transgender Individual   Overall Means Priming Type Male Female   Previous Contact No Contact     Transgender 2.53 (.50) 2.43 (.43)  2.30 (.49) 2.59 (.43)  2.49 (.47) Neutral 2.39 (.43) 2.24 (.35)   2.23 (.40) 2.37 (.39)   2.33 (.40) Note: Means are reported first and standard deviations are in parentheses.      Results of the first analysis concerning gender effects (see Table 2) showed no interaction between gender and prime type. In other words, ratings of the primes did not depend on gender. The results also showed no main effect of gender, indicating that there were no differences between males and females on their prime ratings. Similar to the repeated measures ANOVA results, there was a significant effect of prime type (F(1, 68) = 6.98, p = .010, p2  = .09), where prejudice ratings were significantly higher for transgender primes compared to neutral primes (See Table 1).  Table 2       Mixed ANOVA results showing effects of gender on prejudice rating.

Results of the second analysis concerning contact effects (knowing someone who identifies as transgender vs. not knowing anyone who identifies as transgender) (see Table 3) indicated no interaction effect between contact and prime type. In other words, prime ratings did   34 not depend on contact with transgender individuals. There was, however, a significant main effect of contact (F(1, 68) = 6.46, p = .013, p2  = .09). Transgender prejudice ratings were significantly higher for those reporting no previous contact with transgender persons (M = 2.59, SD = .43) compared to those reporting previous contact (M = 2.30, SD = .49). Similar to the previous ANOVAs, there was significant effect of prime type (F(1, 68) = 4.72, p = .033, p2  = .07), where prejudice ratings were, again, significantly higher for transgender primes compared to neutral primes (See Table 1). Notably, the effects of contact ( p2  = .09; 95% CI = .004, .227) were slightly larger than the effects of prime type ( p2  = .07; 95% CI = .000, .198), though both were modest in size.

Internal Consistency. We calculated Cronbach’s alpha to examine the internal consistency of the Transgender AMP scores as one aspect of reliability of the scores. We first created a set of 50 difference scores by subtracting prejudice ratings on each neutral prime trial from the prejudice rating on a randomly paired transgender prime trial (random pairing without replacement). The difference scores were then treated as items in the analysis (see Payne et al., 2005 for a fuller description). The analysis resulted in a relatively high estimate (  = .87; 95% CI   35 = .82, .91), suggesting that the Transgender AMP scores are internally consistent (Bandalos, 2018).   Discussion In the present work, a three-phase study was conducted to develop and pilot test a standardized procedure assessing implicit transgender prejudice (Transgender AMP). Specifically, we modified the original AMP established by Payne and colleagues (2005) to create the Transgender AMP and to evaluate its performance to establish preliminary evidence of its usability and the validity and internal consistency of its scores, which we discuss below.  Results of the repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of prime, demonstrating a systematic difference in the ratings of transgender primes vs. neutral primes. Specifically, transgender primes were given significantly more negative ratings compared to neutral primes, providing support that the Transgender AMP assesses implicit transgender prejudice. The fact that these priming effects were found despite a blatant warning against being biased by the primes provides further evidence that the Transgender AMP, in fact, assesses uncontrolled, implicit transgender prejudice, which aligns with previous AMP designs utilizing similar explicit warnings (e.g., Payne et al., 2005). Additionally, mirroring previous findings within the explicit transgender prejudice literature (e.g., Acker, 2017; Barbir et al., 2017), our study found that those reporting no contact with transgender-identified individuals exhibited greater implicit transgender prejudice. Our results also support findings from the only known study that examined differences in implicit preference for cisgender persons (over transsexual persons), where those reporting personally knowing at least one transgender person showed less implicit cisgender preference compared to those without any personal contact (Wang-Jones et al., 2017). Furthermore, even though the effect size (Transgender AMP’s effect size converted to   36 Cohen’s d = .63) was not as large as what is reported for the original AMP (average Cohen’s d across five studies = 1.25; Payne et al., 2005), the Transgender AMP nevertheless shows sensitivity as a measure of implicit transgender prejudice. The reason for the large difference in effect sizes  between the original AMP and the Transgender AMP is likely due to differences in the prime stimuli used: Whereas the original AMP utilized visual stimuli, the Transgender AMP used word stimuli. Thus, future research would benefit from exploring alternative Transgender AMP designs with visual stimuli.  On the other hand, inconsistent with previous studies reporting greater transgender prejudice in males as compared to females (e.g., Norton & Herek, 2013; Tebbe & Moradi, 2012), our study found no gender effect on implicit transgender prejudice. Although this finding was unexpected, given evidence in the explicit transgender prejudice literature, a lack of gender difference was also reported in a recent study examining implicit preference for cisgender individuals over transsexual persons (Wang-Jones, 2017). In their study, Wang-Jones and colleagues (2017) found no gender differences in either implicit cisgender preference or measures of explicit transgender prejudice. Given that there were no gender differences on both explicit and implicit measures, the researchers speculated that their unexpected finding was an artifact of their sample. A possible reason for the lack of gender effect in our study may be the small sample size (n = 70), contributing to insufficient power (observed power = .31). It is, however, also possible that gender effects are largely found in explicit transgender prejudice. Future studies with larger sample sizes should, therefore, be conducted to examine the effects of gender on implicit transgender prejudice further. Likewise, as the present study did not test the performance of the new measure in terms of how well it can predict expected behaviors and   37 related attitudes, future work should seek to establish further evidence of validity, especially in the forms of predictive and convergent validity.  In the evaluation of any measurement instrument, reliability is also of basic importance. In our pilot study, the scores of the Transgender AMP demonstrated high internal consistency. As evidence of reliability among other available implicit measures (e.g., various adaptations of the IAT and priming procedures) are mixed, ranging from high to low (e.g., Cunningham, Preacher & Banaji, 2001; Hoffman et al., 2010), the relatively high internal consistency of the new Transgender AMP scores (  = .87; 95% CI = .82, .91) found in the present study is encouraging. The internal consistency of the Transgender AMP scores is also consistent with a meta-analytic average of Cronbach’s alpha estimates across 45 studies utilizing the AMP reported in a recent review of existing AMPs (  = .81; Payne & Lundberg, 2014). As noted by Payne and Lundberg (2014), given that low reliability limits the practical utility of implicit measures (due to the fact that measurement error obscures true relationships among variables), the relatively high demonstrated internal consistency of the Transgender AMP scores is promising for future research utilizing the newly available measure.   An often overlooked but important consideration in instrument development is its usability. As noted by Payne and colleagues (2005), while there are a number of procedures available to assess implicit cognition and attitudes, many require considerable expertise, technology, and effort to administer, making them impractical for many users. Other less labor-intensive techniques, such as the IAT still demands a dual task-structure with multiple phases, which makes it a complex procedure. The Transgender AMP, on the other hand, requires only a single set of instructions for one set of tasks (making simple judgments of a judgment target in a set of trials), which renders it simple, straightforward, and brief, making it more accessible to a   38 diverse usership. In addition, the Transgender AMP allows for an evaluation of one attitude target, as opposed to common IAT designs, which are limited to yielding a relative preference of one target over another (Payne & Lundberg, 2014). Specifically, unlike the recently published Gender Identity IAT (GI-IAT; Wang-Jones et al., 2017), which is limited to producing a measure of relative preference for transsexual (wo)men over cisgender (wo)men, the Transgender AMP gives a measure of implicit transgender prejudice, not dependent upon a comparison group. The Transgender AMP’s ability to assess absolute, not relative, prejudice is particularly beneficial in that it can be used to compare implicit attitudes toward transgender persons with any number of other social groups.    Conclusion Overall, the newly developed Transgender AMP performed as expected, and there is preliminary evidence to suggest that it is a simple, user-friendly procedure with scores exhibiting reasonable internal consistency and some evidence of content and structural validity (Wolfe & Smith, 2007). At the same time, as the current study was an initial study to establish and test the performance of the new procedure, further work should be pursued to garner additional evidence of validity and reliability. Likewise, while compared to the current study, the original AMP development studies (Payne et al., 2005) employed smaller samples (n=32 to 45) and the current sample size (n = 70) is at least double in size, the performance of the Transgender AMP should be tested with a larger sample and not exclusively from an online source. An additional limitation was that, like other AMPs, the use of Chinese characters as judgment targets prohibited the inclusion of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Americans or others with Chinese character literacy, which is likely between 1-2% of the American population (Lopez, Ruiz, & Patten, 2017). Thus, future adaptations of the procedure may explore alternative judgment   39 targets, depending on the population of interest (Flexas et al., 2013). As well, the current AMP design included more primes referring to transgender men than women, which may have biased the results. Future modifications of the Transgender AMP, therefore, may consider exploring potential differences in implicit transgender prejudice based on the gender of the attitude object. In terms of applied research, given what is known from the broader social attitudes research on implicit and explicit attitudes, the Transgender AMP should be utilized to pursue research into the implicit aspect of transgender prejudice, which may offer valuable information to inform more effective intervention strategies to reduce transgender prejudice and discrimination.     40 Chapter 4 Manuscript 2: The Effects of Intergroup Contact on Intergroup Anxiety and Transgender Prejudice: An Examination Using Structural Equation Modeling   This manuscript reports on findings obtained from Study 2, which addressed the main objectives of the dissertation, utilizing the implicit transgender prejudice measure developed in Study 1. As the background and rationale for this study were previously described in Chapters 1 and 2, the introduction of the below manuscript largely overlaps with content from those chapters. Introduction Although the United States has experienced a dramatic rise in the visibility of transgender individuals in recent years, there is indication that this population continues to face prejudice and discrimination associated with their gender identity and expression (APA, 2015; Bryan & Schilt, 2008; Grant, Mottet, & Tanis, 2011; Lombardi, 2009). A large-scale study examining U.S. heterosexual adults’ attitudes toward transgender people, for example, reported participants’ attitudes toward this population to be well below the neutral point (at 32 points on a 100-point scale). Similarly, several studies comparing attitudes toward transgender persons and sexual minorities in the United States also found public attitudes to be significantly more negative toward transgender individuals compared to those toward sexual minorities, highlighting the dire plight of members of this stigmatized group (Lewis et al., 2017; Nagoshi et al., 2008, Norton & Herek, 2013).  Moreover, according to the 2011 Transgender Discrimination Survey, 63% of transgender-identified persons in the United States reported serious experiences of discrimination that significantly disrupted their life, spanning multiple sectors of life, including healthcare,   41 education, and employment (Grant et al., 2011). In a more recent survey of transgender individuals, 54% of the sample reported experiences of verbal harassment, 24% of physical assault, and 13% of sexual violence in K-12 settings (James et al., 2015). There is also sizable documentation that transgender individuals suffer from a variety of mental health consequences—including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicidality—as a result of these experiences (e.g., Bockting, Miner, Swinburne, Hamilton, & Coleman, 2013). In particular, the rate of actual suicide attempts among transgender individuals is alarmingly high, reported at 41%, which far exceeds 5% in the overall population and 10-20% in the LGB population, with some scholars suggesting transgender prejudice as a particularly important factor in understanding these elevated rates of psychological distress and suicidality among the transgender population (Bockting et al., 2013; Haas, Rodgers, & Herman, 2014; James et al., 2015).  Despite the prevalence and known negative impact of transgender prejudice, there is a paucity of research examining possible strategies to reduce this form of prejudice. Thus, in the current study, we apply Allport’s (1954) intergroup contact theory to the study of transgender prejudice to examine how interactions (i.e., contact) with transgender persons influence attitudes toward transgender individuals among U.S. adults. A better understanding of the impact of contact on transgender prejudice may inform not only counseling psychology theory and research, but also contribute to advancing advocacy efforts by illuminating productive avenues for psychoeducation as well as social justice and prejudice reduction interventions.  Transgender Prejudice   Despite slight variations in the nuances of the definition (see Nagoshi et al., 2008 for an example), transgender prejudice has been generally conceptualized as the extent to which a   42 person feels discomfort with or holds biased views against individuals who deviate from conventional gender identities (Walch, Nagamake, Francisco, Stitt, & Shingler, 2012; Hill & Willoughby, 2005). Significantly, scholars have noted that this construct is distinct from sexual prejudice or homophobia (e.g., Weinberg, 1972) in that transgender prejudice describes a type of bias directed specifically against individuals who diverge from traditional gender identities and not heterosexual orientation per se as is the case with sexual prejudice (Nagoshi et al., 2008). Though the term transphobia is commonly used in the literature to designate this construct, transphobia also implies a more limited fear response in the sense of a phobia; therefore, we use the term transgender prejudice in the present study.  Intergroup Contact Theory  One of the most widely known and studied theories on prejudice reduction is the intergroup contact theory. Originally introduced by Gordon Allport (1954) as the contact hypothesis, this theory purports that interactions between members of dissimilar groups, termed ingroup and outgroup (where ingroup refers to members belonging to a given group based on a specific category, such as race; and outgroup refers to those who do not belong to the ingroup based on the specified category) may lead to a decrease in prejudicial attitudes held by members of the ingroup toward the outgroup as a whole. More specifically, Allport (1954) theorized that reduction in prejudice is most likely to occur under certain conditions: when interacting groups or individuals (1) perceive equal status within the situation, (2) are involved in a goal-oriented effort, (3) share a sense of cooperation, and (4) perceive a sense of social sanction and support from authority. These conditions have been considered optimal contact conditions, representing quality aspects of contact in subsequent studies. Since its introduction, this theory has been tested in numerous studies with diverse populations (e.g., groups differing in race/ethnicity, religion,   43 (dis)ability, and sexual orientation status), which has produced an extensive body of literature in support of the theory (e.g., Barr & Bracchitta, 2012; Bohmert, Northcurr, & DeMaris, 2015; Kanas, Scheepers, & Sterkens, 2015). Meta-analytic findings from over 500 empirical studies also offer evidence for this theory, reporting a modest effect of contact on prejudice reduction (r = -.22; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006).   Although limited in volume, several transgender attitudes studies have explored the effects of contact on transgender prejudice with findings generally corresponding to that of the broader intergroup contact literature (Acker, 2017; Barbir, Vandevender, & Cohn, 2017; Bowers, Lewandowski, Savage, & Woitaszewski, 2015; Elischberger, Glazier, Hill, & Verduzco-Baker, 2016; Gazzola & Morrison, 2014; Hill & Willoughby, 2005; Nisley, 2010; Willoughby et al., 2010). For example, in a study examining transgender prejudice among cisgender heterosexual college students, Barber et al. (2017) found significant differences in levels of transgender prejudice between those who reported having no transgender friends vs. at least one transgender friend. Specifically, findings showed that not having a transgender friend was related to more prejudice and less acceptance and support for transgender people. Similarly, using data collected from two large-scale national surveys, Tadlock and colleagues (2017) examined the influence of contact on attitudes regarding transgender people and rights among American adults. Results showed that higher levels of social interactions with transgender individuals significantly predicted greater positive attitudes toward transgender persons as well as greater support for transgender-friendly policies. At the same time, there have been mixed findings in the broader intergroup contact literature concerning the quantity and quality of contact and their associations with prejudice. Whereas some studies have found only quality of contact (and not frequency of contact) as   44 positively relating to prejudice reduction (e.g., Islam & Hewstone, 1993; Schwartz & Simmons, 2001; Stephan, Diaz-Loving, & Duran, 2000) or quality of contact rather than quantity of contact being the better predictor of prejudice reduction (e.g., Binder et al., 2009), others have reported a positive relationship between frequent exposure to outgroup members (i.e., quantity of contact) and reduction in prejudice (e.g., Bornstein, 1989; Harmon-Jones & Allen, 2001; Lee, 2001; Rhodes, Halberstadt & Brajkovich, 2001). Although, overall, there is more evidence in support for quality of contact as being a better predictor of prejudice reduction than quantity of contact (Binder et al., 2009), findings within the contact literature remain mixed, suggesting a need for additional research to clarify the link between differing dimensions of contact and prejudice. This need for clarity is likewise indicated in the transgender attitudes literature, which, to date, has lacked in systematic distinctions between the quantity and quality aspects of contact and has suffered from methodological limitations due, for example, to the use of single-item contact measures and vague and inconsistent language concerning contact (e.g., Bowers et al., 2015; Elischberger et al., 2016; Flores, 2015). Implicit and Explicit Prejudice Findings from within the social attitudes literature have consistently pointed to the importance of examining prejudice held at both the implicit and explicit levels (e.g., Ajzen & Fishbein, 2005; Gawronski & Payne, 2010; Greenwald & Banaji, 1995). According to a dual-process model of prejudice (Fazio & Olson, 2003), explicit prejudice taps deliberate and consciously held biases, whereas implicit prejudice taps automatic forms of biases that operate at the subconscious level. Studies have empirically demonstrated that explicit and implicit prejudice are, in fact, related but distinct constructs with each playing an important role in the   45 overall understanding of prejudice (e.g., Akrami, Ekehammar, Claesson, & Sonnander, 2006; Keith, Bennetto, & Rogge, 2015; Wang-Jones, Alhassoon, Hattrup, Ferdman, & Lowman, 2017).  The importance of the distinction between implicit and explicit prejudice is one that has also been increasingly acknowledged in the intergroup contact literature. More recently, studies within this field have examined the associations between intergroup contact and implicit and explicit prejudice as separate constructs, with some studies also distinguishing between quality and quantity of contact (e.g., Qian, Heyman, Quinn, Fu, & Lee, 2017; Turner, Voci & Hewstone, 2007; Žeželj, Jakšić & Jošić, 2015). For example, a study examining intergenerational attitudes of young people toward the elderly found that frequent contact with the elderly was associated with more favorable implicit attitudes, while positive contact experience was related to more favorable explicit attitudes (Tam, Hewstone, Harwood, Voci, & Kenworthy, 2006). Likewise, in a longitudinal study examining various medical school factors predictive of changes in sexual prejudice among graduating medical students, Phelan and colleagues (2017) found that the quality of contact experiences with sexual minorities during medical school predicted levels of self-reported attitudes toward members of that outgroup, whereas the amount of contact predicted levels of implicit attitudes toward sexual minorities at the end of their medical school training.  At the same time, a few studies have found a different pattern of relationship: Whereas one study found quality of contact impacting both implicit and explicit prejudice (Turner et al., 2007, study 1), another found quantity (but not quality) of contact predicting explicit attitudes (Voci & Hewstone, 2003, study 2), and still another found both quality and quantity of contact to predict explicit but not implicit prejudice (Vezzali & Capozza, 2011). Although the overall pattern of findings in the literature suggest that quality of contact is predictive of explicit   46 prejudice and quantity of contact of implicit prejudice, evidence of variable findings indicate the need to examine these relationships further, especially in the context of transgender prejudice, as, to our knowledge, no study of transgender attitudes to date has examined how the quantity and quality aspects of contact may similarly or differently impact transgender prejudice at the implicit and explicit levels. Intergroup Anxiety Since the introduction of the intergroup contact theory, considerable effort has been given to uncovering underlying mechanisms through which contact impacts prejudice. One explanatory factor that has been identified and studied is intergroup anxiety—a type of anxiety people experience when they anticipate or engage in cross-group interactions (Stephan & Stephan, 1985). In their influential work, Stephan and Stephan (1985) postulated that contact with outgroup members reduces prejudice via intergroup anxiety. More specifically, they suggest that intergroup anxiety stems primarily from an anticipation of detrimental consequences to the self during contact, which results in information processing bias (such as narrowed focus of attention and increase in simplified and expectancy-confirming processing), and subsequently sustains existing prejudice. According to this theory, interaction between ingroup and outgroup members reduces this type of anxiety, which in turn lessens prejudice.  Models examining the mediating role of intergroup anxiety have been supported in previous studies with a variety of target outgroups, including Hindus and Muslims (Islam & Hewstone, 1993), British and Japanese nationals (Greenland & Brown, 1999), and Americans and Mexicans (Stephan et al., 2000). Moreover, in a meta-analysis of the three most studied mediators of intergroup contact and prejudice, intergroup anxiety was found as a much stronger mediator than either knowledge or empathy and perspective-taking (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008).   47 Although most of the mediation studies to date have examined the intergroup anxiety model in the context of explicit prejudice, several of the more recent studies have examined both explicit and implicit prejudice, with some also differentiating between quality and quantity aspects of contact. Largely paralleling findings from earlier literature, recent work also indicates that intergroup anxiety is a significant explanatory variable, particularly in the relationship between quality of contact and explicit prejudice (e.g., Keith et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2007; Žeželj et al., 2015). For instance, in a study examining the relationship between cross-orientation contact (i.e., contact between heterosexual and non-heterosexual persons) and attitudes toward lesbian and gay individuals, Lytle and colleagues (2017b) found that intergroup anxiety mediated the relationship between contact and sexual prejudice in their sample of U.S. undergraduate students, such that higher quality of contact predicted less intergroup anxiety, which in turn predicted lower levels of self-reported sexual prejudice.  On the other hand, whether intergroup anxiety similarly mediates the relationships between (a) quality of contact and implicit prejudice, (b) quantity of contact and explicit prejudice, and/or (c) quantity of contact and implicit prejudice remains unclear. This may partially be due to the divergent target groups examined, differences in the measures used to assess both the predictor and criterion variables, as well as the variability in model complexity across studies (e.g., Prestwich, Kenworthy, Wilson, Kwan-Tat, 2008; Stephan et al., 2000; Voci & Hewstone, 2003). These uncertainties suggest the need to further explore potentially different mechanisms at work in the relationships among quality and quantity of contact and implicit and explicit prejudice. Given that an understanding of the underlying mechanisms may aid in the formulation of more focal contact strategies that maximize the contact effect, it would be   48 important to test this previously unexamined mediation model in the context of transgender prejudice. Current Study In light of the promising body of literature showing intergroup contact’s association with reduced prejudice levels and the limitations of existing studies within both the social attitudes and transgender attitudes literature, the current study sought to extend previous efforts by applying the intergroup contact theory to the study of transgender prejudice. Specifically, we took a holistic approach to understanding the interrelations among the two dimensions of contact (quality and quantity), intergroup anxiety, and the two types of transgender prejudice (implicit and explicit) in a sample of U.S. adults. Based on findings from the existing literature (e.g., Elischberger et al., 2016; Flores, 2015; Norton & Herek, 2013), we controlled for the effects of gender, religiosity, and political conservatism in the models. Building upon previous research, we addressed the following research questions and related hypotheses (see Figure 1a and b for conceptual models): With regard to prejudice towards transgender persons within the general U.S. population: • RQ1. How does quantity of contact with transgender persons impact prejudice? o H1. Quantity of contact will have a negative, direct effect on implicit prejudice, such that greater quantity of contact will be associated with less implicit prejudice. • RQ2. How does quality of contact with transgender persons impact prejudice?  o H2. Quality of contact will have a negative, direct effect on explicit prejudice, such that greater quality of contact will be associated with less explicit prejudice.   49 • RQ3. How does intergroup anxiety mediate the effect of contact with transgender persons on prejudice? o H3. Intergroup anxiety will mediate the effect of quality of contact on explicit prejudice, such that greater quality of contact will be associated with less intergroup anxiety, which in turn will be associated with less explicit prejudice.  Figure 1a. Direct Effects Model for Research Questions 1 and 2  Figure 1b. Mediation Model for Research Question 3   50 Method Participants Data from a nonrandom online sample of 354 participants were analyzed in the current study. The sample consisted of 52.5% women and 47.5% men with a mean age of 37.53 (SD = 11.56, range = 19 ~ 73). The participants were majority White (81.6%) and heterosexual (83.3%) with 54.8% holding at least a Bachelor’s degree. The majority of the participants also lived in the suburbs (54.8%) and reported earning an annual income over $40,000. In terms of religious affiliation, 49.7% self-identified as non-religious, 18.1% as Christian (non-Catholic, non-evangelical), 16.1% as Catholic, 7.9% as evangelical Christian, and a small proportion also identified as Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish, and other. The demographic characteristics of the participants corresponded to that of the U.S. population based on the 2010 census data in terms of gender (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). Our sample, however, overrepresented Caucasians and those with at least a Bachelor’s degree and underrepresented African Americans and individuals with a high school education in the range of 5-10%. Likewise, the Public Religion Research Institute (Jones & Cox, 2016) and Pew (Pew Research Center, 2015) studies on religious identifications suggest our sample underrepresented Christians (non-Catholic, non-evangelical) by 7-11% and evangelical Christians by approximately 10-17%. Our sample also overrepresented sexual minorities by approximately 11% according to the 2017 Gallup poll (Newport, 2018). See Table 1 for full demographics information.         Table 1.

Attitudes toward Transgender Individuals Scale (ATTI). The ATTI (Walch et al., 2012) is a single-factor scale comprised of 20 items that assesses prejudicial attitudes toward transgender persons. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree. After reverse scoring negatively worded items, higher scores indicate greater tolerance and acceptance of transgender persons (i.e., less transgender prejudice). Sample items on the scale include, “Transgendered individuals should not be allowed to work with children” and “Transgenderism endangers the institution of the family.” Internal consistency of ATTI scores was supported by Walch et al. (2012) in their two college samples (α = .96, α = .95) and by Solomon and Kurtz-Costes (2018) in an online U.S. adult sample (α = .94, α = .95). The internal consistency of scores for the present sample was α = .97. The original validation study reported evidence of convergent and discriminant validity (see Walch et al., 2012 for details). To reflect the recent development in the literature concerning most respectful language towards transgender persons, the term “transgendered” was replaced with “transgender.” Additionally, for clarity, items were re-coded in the opposite direction after data collection, such that higher scores indicate greater prejudice.  Transgender Affect Misattribution Procedure (Transgender AMP). The Transgender AMP (Kanamori, Harrell-Williams, Xu, & Ovrebo, 2019) is a modification of the original AMP (Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005) that assesses implicit transgender prejudice. Like other affect misattribution procedures, the Transgender AMP utilizes the logic of priming and    53 projective tests to assess participants’ automatic (i.e., implicit) attitudes by examining the unconscious impact of a prime stimulus on a person’s appraisal of a neutral target. In the Transgender AMP, each trial starts with a display of a neutral or transgender term as a prime. The prime appears in the center of the screen, followed by a blank screen, and a Chinese pictograph, each displaying for 100ms. The Chinese pictograph is then replaced by a black and white pattern mask that remains on the screen until a response is selected. The Transgender AMP consists of 10 blocks of 10 trials each, amounting to a total of 100 trials. Every prime stimulus (five transgender and five neutral) is displayed once in each block, thus resulting in ten presentations of each prime. Each of the ten prime stimuli is randomly paired with a unique Chinese character in each block, amounting to the use of 100 distinct characters.  In the Transgender AMP, participants rate the pleasantness of each Chinese character on a 4-point Likert scale (3 = very unpleasant, 4 = slightly unpleasant, 7 = slightly pleasant, 8 = very pleasant). Responses are first re-coded to range from 1 to 4 where 1 = very unpleasant. They are then reverse coded, such that higher scores indicate more transgender prejudice, for further clarity and ease of interpretation. The Transgender AMP development study (Kanamori et al., 2019) found that the priming effects persisted even when participants were given a blatant warning to not allow the primes to bias their responses (also used in the present study), providing evidence that the Transgender AMP taps implicitly held prejudice that is outside of one’s conscious control. This study also provided evidence for the reliability of Transgender AMP scores (α = .87). A similar measure of internal consistency of scores was found with the current sample (α = .89).  Contact measure. The General Intergroup Contact Quantity and Contact Quality Scale (CQCQ; Islam & Hewstone, 1993) is a two-factor scale consisting of ten items intended to assess    54 the quantity and quality of direct intergroup encounters. The five contact quantity items ask respondents about their amount of contact with a given outgroup in a variety of settings (e.g., “How much contact do you have with [outgroup] as neighbors?”), whereas the five contact quality items assess the overall valence of respondents’ contact experience (e.g., “To what extent did you experience the contact with [outgroup] as superficial or intimate?”). Items on this scale are rated on a 7-point Likert scale, with slightly differently nuanced response choices ranging from 1 = none at all/not at all/definitely not/definitely involuntary/very superficial/very competitive to 7 = a great deal/very often/definitely yes/definitely voluntary/very intimate/very cooperative. Higher scores on the contact quantity subscale indicate greater amount of direct contact with the given outgroup. Similarly, higher scores on the contact quality subscale indicate more positive direct contact experiences with the given outgroup.  Internal consistency of the contact quantity subscale scores was supported by Islam and Hewstone (1993) in a sample of Hindus and Muslims in Bangladesh (α = .90 and .82, respectively). A similar range of Cronbach’s alphas were reported for a 4-item adaptation of the contact quality subscale in a sample of Italian students and adults (α = .82; Voci & Hewstone, 2003) and in student samples in Northern Ireland (α = .86; Tausch, Tam, Hewstone, Kenworthy, & Cairns, 2007). The internal consistency of scores was α =.84 for the contact quantity subscale and α = .79 for the contact quality subscale in the current sample. There is also demonstrated evidence of convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of CQCQ scores (e.g., Islam & Hewstone, 1993; Tausch, Tam et al., 2007; Voci & Hewstone, 2003). For the purpose of this study, wording on item 1 of the contact quantity subscale was modified from “How much contact do you have with [outgroup] at college” to “How much contact do you have with [outgroup] at    55 work, school, or other social settings” as our sample was not limited to college students in the present study.  Intergroup anxiety measure. The Intergroup Anxiety Scale – Short Form (IAS-SF; Paolini, Hewstone, Cairns, & Voci, 2004) is a modified version of the original Intergroup Anxiety Scale (IAS) developed by Stephan and Stephan (1985). This scale consists of six items designed to assess negative affective responses experienced by individuals when they anticipate future contact with outgroup members (Britt, Boniecki, Vescio, Biernat, & Brown, 1999). For this scale, participants are asked to imagine how they would feel if they were the only member of their ingroup interacting with members of another social group. With this scenario in mind, participants are instructed to rate the extent to which they feel happy, awkward, self-conscious, confident, relaxed, and defensive on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = not at all to 4 = extremely. After reverse scoring three items, higher scores indicate greater levels of intergroup anxiety. Reported Cronbach’s alpha for IAS-SF scores range from α = .86 to .90 in Irish and British undergraduate samples (Paolini et al., 2004; Turner et al., 2007) and α = .86 for the current study sample. Construct validity was supported through correlations in the expected direction between IAS-SF scores and out-group prejudice, direct cross-group friendships, extended friendships, and out-group variability (Paolini et al., 2004; Turner et al., 2007). For the present study, the introductory passage presented at the beginning of the instrument was modified such that participants were asked to imagine interacting with transgender persons.  Demographic questionnaire. Participants also completed a brief demographics questionnaire containing questions pertaining to their race/ethnicity, age, annual income, perceived SES, residence, gender, sex, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, political conservatism, and level of education.     56 Procedures After obtaining IRB approval, we recruited study participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online platform hosting a pool of individuals who complete surveys and other tasks in exchange for payment. MTurk is a tool increasingly utilized by social psychologists due to its efficiency in participant recruitment and provision of diverse samples that are of equal or superior quality to those obtained through other convenience sampling methods (Berinsky, Huber & Lenz, 2012; Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; Ipeirotis, Provost & Wang, 2010; Mason & Suri, 2012). Prior empirical evidence provides support for the trustworthiness of data collected through this platform, especially for U.S. samples (Buhrmester et al., 2011; Crump, McDonnell, & Gureckis, 2013; Steelman, Hammer, & Limayem, 2014). For the present study, we recruited individuals over 18 years of age, residing in the United States. Since the focus of the study was on the effects of both quality and quantity of transgender contact on prejudice reduction and because of the use of Chinese characters in one of the survey instruments, participation was restricted to those with at least minimal previous contact with transgender persons and unfamiliar with Chinese characters.  Data were collected through an online survey platform, Qualtrics, and Inquisit Millisecond 5. The study was presented as a two-part study concerning (a) how people make quick judgments while avoiding distractions and (b) peoples’ experiences with different social groups. Following informed consent, participants were first directed to complete the Transgender AMP, after which they were directed to the rest of the study questionnaire. The Transgender AMP was presented first because it is intended to measure spontaneous affective reactions to transgender primes, which could be affected by questions on other measures that ask participants to give extensive thought to transgender issues (Payne, McClernon, & Dobbins, 2007). After    57 participants completed the AMP, they were directed to Qualtrics to complete the remaining measures for the study, which were presented in a random order to minimize order effects (Heppner & Heppner, 2004). Qualtrics’s “Prevent Ballot Box Stuffing” option was selected to keep individuals from participating in the study more than once, the “Request Response” function was activated to minimize item nonresponse, and three attention check items were included to identify patterns of random responding.  Data Analysis The two-step Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach outlined in Anderson and Gerbing (1988) was used to test the proposed relationships among the variables of interest: quality of contact, quantity of contact, intergroup anxiety, implicit transgender prejudice, and explicit transgender prejudice. First, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to examine the adequacy of the measurement model, followed by a test of the structural models. As noted above, all models were estimated using the robust Satorra-Bentler (MLM) method due to the non-normal nature of the data. We evaluated the overall fit of the models based on the model chi-square test along with three additional fit indices: root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), and standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR). Hu and Bentler’s (1999) target values were used as a guide: RMSEA less than or equal to .06 (90% CI < 1; Weston & Gore, 2006), CFI greater than .95, and SRMR less than or equal to .08. We controlled for the effects of gender, religiosity, and political conservatism by including paths from the control variables to all variables of interest in the models. Alternative models were also tested, and the Chi-square difference test was used for model comparison. Data preparation was conducted in SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp., 2017), and Mplus version 7.4 (Muthén & Muthén, 2015) was used to perform SEM analyses.     58 Results Data Preparation and Preliminary Analyses  Data were first screened for accuracy of input and completeness. Listwise deletion was used for cases that did not meet requirements for participation and were missing more than half of the responses on the survey items (which included those who failed to pass attention check). The Little MCAR test indicated that the remaining data were missing completely at random (χ2 = 293.63, df = 276, p = .223). Since only .81% (n = 3) of all cases were missing data (where one did not provide their age and two did not report on the number of transgender persons they personally knew), and these items were not a vital part of the Research Questions, they were retained in the study. Although one of the assumptions for SEM is lack of univariate and multivariate outliers, since data for the current study included ratings on items for which extreme values were reasonably expected (e.g., the number of transgender persons personally known, ratings on feelings interacting with transgender people, etc.), we instead screened responses for validity of values. Specifically, we checked for patterns of random responding, unusually long or short response time latency, similar ratings on positively and negatively worded items, and invalid response codes (e.g., two-digit response codes recorded where they should have been single-digit response codes), which resulted in the deletion of ten cases. We then tested the data for univariate and multivariate normality, and the data failed to meet these assumptions (p < .001) likely due to the large sample size and the nature of the items as noted above. Since our data failed to meet the assumption of normality, we used the robust (Satorra-Bentler) estimation method recommended for non-normal data for the main analyses. After data screening, we were left with a total of 354 participants in the final sample.     59 Since all latent variables in our study (explicit and implicit transgender prejudice, intergroup anxiety, and quality and quantity of contact) were assessed with single instruments, we modeled the latent variables by constructing indicators using parcels created from items on each of the instruments (Weston & Gore, 2006; Tebbe & Moradi, 2012). Items measuring implicit transgender prejudice were parceled based on item content while items assessing explicit transgender prejudice, intergroup anxiety, and quality and quantity of contact were parceled based on item factor loadings from separate Exploratory Factor Analyses (EFAs). Specifically, for implicit transgender prejudice, we created five parcels (TAMP1 – TAMP5) by summing the ratings on each of the five transgender word primes used in the Transgender AMP. To create the EFA-based parcels, we first rank ordered the items on each instrument from highest to lowest according to factor loadings obtained from the EFAs, then assigned the items to two or three parcels (depending on the number of items on the instrument) in countervailing order so that the average factor loadings would be similar across parcels. This procedure resulted in two latent factors with three indicators and two with two indicators: ATTIP1 – ATTIP3 as indicators of explicit transgender prejudice; ANXP1 – ANXP3 as indicators of intergroup anxiety; QualP1 and QualP2 as indicators of quality of contact; and QuantP1 and QuantP2 as indicators of quantity of contact. Item ratings were summed to create a score for each parcel.  Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations for scores on all indicators used in the study are presented in Table 2. All correlations were significant at p < .01, and, as would be expected, correlations among scores within the same constructs were greater than those between different constructs. Correlations among some item parcels were high, but this was expected as parcels were constructed from items from the same scale.       Table 2.

N = 354.  All correlations significant at p < .01.                     We additionally calculated descriptive statistics for scores of all study instruments. Here we use the mean scores (rather than sum scores) for ease of interpretation. Results indicated that, on average, our study sample had relatively low explicit prejudice (M = 2.07, SD = .99; on a 5-point scale), average levels of implicit prejudice (M = 2.41, SD = .44; on a 4-point scale), and below average intergroup anxiety (M = 2.00, SD = .70; on a 4-point scale). The sample as a whole also reported infrequent contact with transgender people (M = 2.72, SD = 1.16; on a 7-point scale), but rated the quality of contact as above average (M = 5.13 , SD = 1.11; on a 7-point scale). Measurement Model  We first conducted a Confirmative Factor Analysis (CFA) to test the adequacy of the measurement model consisting of five latent factors and 15 observed variables (item parcels). The results of the initial CFA analysis produced a warning message noting a potential  problem involving item parcel QuantP2. Given that the latent factors, Quantity and Quality of Contact, were modeled with only two item parcels each and that these parcels were highly correlated (r = .74 and r = .66, respectively), we created single indicator variables to model Quantity and Quality of Contact (by creating a single sum score from the five items on each of the subscales) and tested the re-specified measurement model. This resulted in fit indices and parameter estimates supporting good model fit, suggesting that the issue was one of multicollinearity. The results of model chi-square test and fit indices of the re-specified model were as follows: χ2 (57, n = 354) = 109.73, p < 0.0001; RMSEA = 0.051 (90% CI = 0.037, 0.065), CFI = 0.986, SRMR = 0.025. Given the large sample size, we calculated a normed chi-square, which produced a value less than 4 (normed χ2 = 1.93), indicating adequate model fit. All pattern coefficients in the measurement model were significant and high (.708 - .984), suggesting that the indicators    62 sufficiently measured their respective latent variables (see Table 3 for standardized path coefficients).

N = 354. All path coefficients significant at p < .001.   Structural Models Direct effects model. We tested three direct effects models.  Model 1. The initial structural model consisted of two exogenous variables (Quantity and Quality of Contact) and two endogenous factors (Explicit and Implicit Transgender Prejudice) along with three control variables (gender, religiosity, and political conservatism). The model was tested for the direct effects of Quality of Contact on Explicit Transgender Prejudice and Quantity of Contact on Implicit Transgender Prejudice while controlling for the effects of gender, religiosity, and political conservatism. Results indicated excellent model fit: χ2 (53, n = 354) = 98.96, p = 0.0001 (normed χ2 = 1.87 < 4); RMSEA = 0.049 (90% CI = 0.034, 0.064), CFI = 0.984, SRMR = 0.054. Parameter estimates showed that Quality of Contact had a significant    63 negative impact on Explicit Transgender Prejudice (  = -.60) and that Quantity of Contact likewise had a significant negative impact on Implicit Transgender Prejudice (  = -.25), though its effect was weaker than that of the effect of Quality of Contact on Explicit Transgender prejudice. Overall, the model accounted for approximately 69% of the variance in Explicit Transgender Prejudice and 11% of the variance in Implicit Transgender Prejudice.  Model 2. Based on some research suggesting that frequent exposure to stimuli (i.e., quantity of contact), including with various social groups, breeds familiarity, which fosters liking, leading to more positive attitudes (for a review, see Bornstein, 1992), we tested an alternative model that included a direct relationship between Quantity of Contact and Explicit Transgender Prejudice while all other relationships remained the same. Although the fit indices indicated a good fit (χ2 (52, n = 354) = 99.27, p = 0.0001; RMSEA = .051 (90% CI = 0.035, 0.066), CFI = 0.984, SRMR = 0.054), the alternative model produced a slightly larger chi-square value than the original model and, as expected, the Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square difference test indicated that there was no significant improvement in model fit: (∆χ2 (1, n = 354) = .03, p > .05). Results also showed no significant impact of Quantity of Contact on Explicit Prejudice (   = -.01).  Model 3. Based on some evidence suggesting a link between quality of contact and both implicit and explicit prejudice in the broader social attitudes literature (e.g., Keith et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2007), we tested a second alternative model with an added relationship between Quality of Contact and Implicit Transgender Prejudice to the original model, keeping all other relationships the same. This resulted in a significant improvement in model fit: χ2 (52, n = 354) = 82.48, p = 0.0045 (normed χ2 = 1.59 < 4); RMSEA = .041 (90% CI = 0.023; 0.057), CFI = 0.990, SRMR = 0.024; ∆χ2 (1, n = 354) = 17.03, p < .001. Parameter estimates showed that Quality of    64 Contact had a significant negative impact on both Explicit (  = -.61) and Implicit (   = -.25) Transgender Prejudice while Quantity of Contact had a significant negative impact on Implicit Transgender Prejudice (  = -.18). Of note also, of the three control variables, political conservatism was a factor significantly related to Explicit Transgender Prejudice (  = .296) and Quality of Contact (   = -.399). Religiosity was significantly related to Explicit Transgender Prejudice only (  = .188), and gender differences were statistically nonsignificant in all measures in the model. Overall, the model accounted for approximately 69% of the variance in Explicit Transgender Prejudice and 16% of the variance in Implicit Transgender Prejudice with this model explaining 5% more of the variance in Implicit Prejudice as compared to the original model. Based on these findings, we retained model 3 as our final direct effects model. Figure 2 depicts the final model with all parameter estimates. The figure, however, omits control variables for clarity.        65  Figure 2. Final Direct Effects Model  Notes. 1. N = 354            2. R2 for implicit transgender prejudice = .160            3.

Model controls for gender, religiosity, and political conservatism with paths from control variables from all study variables  Mediation model. To examine the mediating role of Intergroup Anxiety, we tested three models in which Intergroup Anxiety was added to the final direct effects model (again, controlling for gender, religiosity, and political conservatism). The significance of the indirect effects were tested using the bias corrected bootstrap procedure outlined by Mallinckrodt and colleagues (2006), where we ran the models with 1,000 random bootstrap samples to create 95% CIs around the estimates of indirect effects. According to this method, a mediation effect is considered significant at p < .05 if the estimated 95% CI of the indirect effect does not contain zero (Mallinckrodt, Abraham, Wei, & Russell, 2006).     66 Model 1. We first tested a mediation model that included a direct path from Quality of Contact to Explicit Transgender Prejudice and an indirect/mediated path from Quality of Contact to Intergroup Anxiety to Explicit Transgender Prejudice, which produced good model fit: χ2 (86, n = 354) = 174.37, p < 0.0001 (normed χ2 = 2.03 < 4); RMSEA = .054 (90% CI = 0.042, 0.065), CFI = 0.978, SRMR = 0.040. An examination of parameter estimates showed statistically significant direct effects for all paths of interest: from Quality of Contact to Intergroup Anxiety (  = -.62), from Intergroup Anxiety to Explicit Transgender Prejudice (  = .33), and from Quality of Contact to Explicit Prejudice (  = -.40). Likewise, the indirect effect of Quality of Contact on Explicit Prejudice through Intergroup Anxiety was significant (  = -.21, 95% CI = -.293, -.131), suggesting that Intergroup Anxiety partially mediated the relationship between Quality of Contact and Explicit Transgender Prejudice. The direct paths from Quantity (  = -.18) and Quality of contact (  = -.25) to implicit prejudice were also significant, and the model accounted for 75.1% of the variance in Explicit Prejudice, 44.2% of the variance in Intergroup Anxiety, and 16% of the variance in Implicit Prejudice.   Model 2. Next, we tested an alternative model in which Intergroup Anxiety also mediated the relationship between Quality of Contact and Implicit Transgender Prejudice. This resulted in improved model fit: χ2 (85, n = 354) = 166.79, p < 0.0001 (normed χ2 = 1.96 < 4); RMSEA = .052 (90% CI = 0.040, 0.064), CFI = 0.980, SRMR = 0.028, and the difference was significant (∆χ2 (1, n = 354) = 7.57, p < .01). As in the previous model, Quality of Contact had significant direct effects on Explicit Transgender Prejudice and Intergroup Anxiety as did Intergroup Anxiety on Explicit Transgender Prejudice. The indirect effect of Quality of Contact on Explicit Transgender Prejudice through Intergroup Anxiety was also significant (  = -.210, 95%CI = -.295, -.131), again, suggesting that Intergroup Anxiety partially explained the effect of Quality of    67 Contact on Explicit Transgender Prejudice. On the other hand, the direct effect of Quality of Contact on Implicit Transgender Prejudice was not significant while its indirect effect through Intergroup Anxiety was significant (  = -.130, 95%CI = -.232, -.029). This suggests that the impact of Quality of Contact on Implicit Transgender Prejudice was fully mediated through Intergroup Anxiety. Quantity of Contact was, again, found to have a significant direct inverse effect on Implicit Transgender Prejudice. As was the case in the direct effects model, of the three control variables, political conservatism was significantly related to Explicit Transgender Prejudice (  = .267) and Quality of Contact (   = -.399). Religiosity was a factor significantly related to Explicit Transgender Prejudice only (  = .178), and gender differences were statistically nonsignificant in all measures in the model. This model explained an additional 2.8% of the variance in implicit transgender prejudice.  Model 3. We then tested a third theoretically plausible model with an added path from Quantity of Contact to Intergroup Anxiety to test whether Intergroup Anxiety mediated the association between Quantity of Contact and Implicit Transgender Prejudice. Results of this modified model showed good model fit: χ2 (84, n = 354) = 166.326, p < 0.0001; RMSEA = .053 (90% CI = 0.041, 0.064), CFI = 0.980, SRMR = 0.028. However, since the effect of Quantity of Contact on Intergroup Anxiety was not significant (  = -.03), the addition of this path did not change the amount of variance explained, and the chi-square difference test indicated no significant difference in model fit (∆χ2 (1, n = 354) = .47, p > .05), it was determined that mediation model 2 best explained the relationships among the variables. See Figure 3 for final mediation model with standardized parameter estimates and Table 4 for a summary of direct, indirect, and total effect sizes.    68  Figure 3. Final Mediation Model  Notes. 1.

Discussion The purpose of the present study was to apply the intergroup contact theory to the study of transgender prejudice. Specifically, we examined how the quantity and quality of interactions with transgender individuals impact implicit and explicit prejudice held toward members of this group. We additionally explored the role of intergroup anxiety as a potential mediator in the relationship between contact and prejudice to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of the intergroup contact effect, specifically in the context of transgender prejudice. Importantly, our study extended previous research by simultaneously considering the interrelations among the two dimensions of contact (quality and quantity), intergroup anxiety, and the two types of transgender prejudice (implicit and explicit) in an integrative model via SEM, controlling for the effects of gender, religiosity, and political conservatism. Results supported all three hypotheses.    70 Quantity of Contact and Transgender Prejudice  As hypothesized, our results showed that quantity of contact has a unique inverse effect on implicit transgender prejudice. In other words, more frequent interactions with transgender persons across a variety of settings predicted lower levels of implicit transgender prejudice, though its effect was limited. This finding is consistent with prior work in the broader intergroup contact literature conducted with diverse populations (e.g., Phelan et al, 2017; Voci & Hewstone, 2003; Tam et al., 2006; Turner et al., 2007) and contributes to the transgender attitudes literature as one of the first to demonstrate the link specifically between contact frequency and subconsciously held transgender prejudice. This finding also supports the theory that implicit attitudes are more likely to be influenced by exposure to outgroup members as they are automatic rather than deliberative (as is the case with explicit prejudice) and are activated by the mere presence of an attitude object  (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Given evidence that implicit attitudes are more stable and impervious to change compared to explicit attitudes (e.g., Gawronski & Strack, 2003; Gregg, Seibt, & Banaji, 2006; Wilson, Lindsey, & Schooler, 2000), it may be worthwhile to invest effort in intentionally creating and encouraging more contact opportunities with transgender individuals in order to capitalize on even the modest effect indicated in the current study.   In keeping with some findings from the intergroup contact literature, we also found that quantity of contact was not associated with explicit prejudice (e.g., Prestwich et al., 2008; Turner et al., 2007). More specifically, our results indicate that the amount of interaction with transgender persons has no impact on self-reported attitudes toward this group, suggesting that simple exposure may not be sufficient to influence consciously held prejudice against transgender individuals. Though this finding may, at first glance, seem counter to prior    71 transgender studies reporting an inverse association between contact and self-reported transgender bias (e.g., Acker, 2017; Barbir et al., 2017; Bowers et al., 2015; Elischberger et al., 2016; Gazzola & Morrison, 2014), a closer examination suggests that methodological limitations of existing studies likely explain the apparent contradiction. As a case in point, in their study, Barbir and colleagues (2017) used the number of transgender friendships as a measure of contact and reported that greater contact was associated with lower explicit prejudice and discrimination. On the one hand, it could be argued that this item assessed contact quantity by viewing the number of friends as an indicator of the amount of contact; on the other hand, shifting the focus to friendship, it could be argued that the item assed contact quality. In this way, the vague operationalization of transgender contact found in this study as well as others prevents a more precise interpretation of the results. Our study and its findings, therefore, offer important clarity to the understanding of contact and transgender prejudice by teasing apart the differing aspects of contact and types of prejudice. Since our study is one of the first to examine the associations between the quantity aspect of contact and explicit and implicit transgender prejudice, however, additional research should be conducted to corroborate current findings.  Quality of Contact and Transgender Prejudice Our study also found that quality of contact has a significant impact on both explicit and implicit transgender prejudice. In particular, quality of contact was found to have an inverse effect on explicit and implicit transgender prejudice, indicating that more favorable contact experiences with transgender persons (i.e., interactions that were experienced as more equal, voluntary, intimate, pleasant, and cooperative) were related to lower levels of transgender prejudice both at the implicit and explicit levels. Of note, its effects were stronger than that of quantity of contact, providing overall support for the relative importance of the nature (i.e.,    72 quality) of contact in the shaping of intergroup attitudes as originally posited by Allport (1954) and subsequently substantiated in a number of data-driven studies (e.g., Brown, Maras, Masser, Vivian, & Hewstone, 2001; Eller & Abrams, 2003; Schwartz & Simmons, 2001). It is also worth noting that the effect of quality of contact on explicit prejudice was nearly two and a half times its effect on implicit prejudice. In other words, our results suggest that interactions that are experienced as more positive tend to have a greater impact on consciously held bias against transgender people than on those held at the subconscious level. This fits with the notion that consciously held attitudes may be influenced more through processes that involve deliberate awareness and evaluation (such as being cognizant of having positive interaction experiences) as suggested by Turner et al., 2007. Our results also confirm the pattern of findings found in several studies within the wider intergroup literature (e.g., Keith et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2007) and extend previous transgender attitudes research by elucidating the unique role that high quality contact may play in the reduction of explicit prejudice and its combined role (together with quantity of contact) in the curtailing of implicit transgender prejudice.  Given that high-quality contact was found to have a strong influence on explicit prejudice and a greater impact on implicit prejudice relative to the amount of contact, it may be prudent to focus efforts on creating opportunities that foster more favorable cross-group interaction experiences than merely increasing contact opportunities. In particular, there is some evidence to suggest that cooperative-learning programs—a form of high-quality contact—may be especially effective in increasing social acceptance of stigmatized groups (Piercy, Wilton, & Townsend, 2002). Thus intervention strategists may do well to design transgender prejudice reduction programs that involve participants working cooperatively toward a common goal. Training programs of mental health professionals may likewise benefit from the inclusion of such    73 cooperative learning opportunities with transgender individuals as part of their curricula to better prepare clinicians for work with transgender clients. These findings also have implications for transgender persons by suggesting that being open about their gender identity may ultimately benefit them by increasing the likelihood of meaningful interaction experiences with cisgender individuals, thereby shaping their attitudes toward the transgender population at large.   Intergroup Anxiety as Mediator  The present study found that intergroup anxiety plays an important role in explaining the effect of quality of contact on explicit and implicit prejudice. Specifically, the effect on quality of contact on explicit prejudice was partially mediated by intergroup anxiety, such that favorable contact experiences was associated with lower intergroup anxiety, which in turn was related to lower levels of consciously held prejudice. This finding adds to the body of literature in support of the intergroup anxiety theory, explaining the intergroup contact effect (e.g., Greenland & Brown, 1999; Stephan & Stephan, 1985; Žeželj et al., 2015), and provides initial evidence that this pattern of relationship holds in the context of transgender prejudice. Furthermore, our results showed that intergroup anxiety fully explained the effect of quality of contact on implicit prejudice. In other words, the impact of quality of contact on implicit transgender prejudice was adequately captured as an indirect influence through intergroup anxiety. These findings suggest that intergroup anxiety may be a factor in understanding the politics of fear related to transgender people in this country, which, again, highlight the value not only of cultivating meaningful relationships with members of this population, but suggests the benefit of encouraging transgender people to be “out” about their gender identities so as to allow for those experiences to take place and assuage the intergroup anxiety shaping prejudicial attitudes. These findings also point to the potential value of tailoring prejudice reduction programs to specifically target the    74 feeling of anxiety (i.e., affective experiences) arising in anticipation of or while engaged in intergroup interactions as well as the need to explore additional contextual elements that may enhance feelings of ease and comfort in cross-group contact situations.  On the other hand, the effect of quantity of contact on implicit transgender prejudice was not mediated through intergroup anxiety, suggesting that there may be another mechanism through which frequency of interaction impacts automatic forms of bias. Findings from several experimental work indicate that frequent exposure to an attitude object may serve to establish positive mental associations with the attitude object and that those associations may manifest in less implicit bias. For instance, exposure to images of strong female leaders (Dasgupta & Asgari, 2004) and highly regarded African Americans (Dasgupta & Greenwald, 2001) were found to lower implicit prejudice against females and African Americans. Additionally, some previous work has reported high correlations (r = .58 - .79) between measures of implicit attitudes and amygdala activity (i.e., region of the brain associated with emotional experiences; Cunningham et al., 2004; Phelps et al., 2000), which, coupled with evidence that amygdala activation is related to a number of different emotions (Zald, 2003), suggest the possibility that affective pathways other than anxiety may be at work in the association between contact frequency and implicit transgender prejudice. As this is the first known study testing the mediating role of intergroup anxiety in the association between contact and transgender prejudice, additional work is needed to better understand the pathways through which contact frequency influences implicit transgender prejudice.   Limitations, Conclusions, and Future Directions As in any other study, findings from the current study should be interpreted in view of several limitations. First, the over-representations and under-representations of several    75 demographic categories in the participant pool resulting from the non-random sampling method utilized limit the generalizability of the results. Likewise, even though previous research supports the quality of MTurk-based data (Berinsky et al., 2012), future work with non-online samples would be prudent to pursue as the current study was conducted with an entirely web-based sample. The fact that participants self-selected to be in the study also suggest that the data likely contain some level of selection bias (Rosenman, Tennekoon, & Hill, 2011). Another limitation is that our model focused on select predictor variables (i.e., quantity and quality of contact and intergroup anxiety) for the purpose of testing the intergroup contact theory, and therefore represents only one model explaining the data structure well. The fact that the final model explained a relatively small amount of variance in implicit transgender prejudice suggests that additional variables should be included in future models. Specifically, factors such as empathy (e.g., Stephan & Finlay, 1999; Batson et al., 1997), perspective taking (e.g., Aberson & Haag, 2007), and outgroup knowledge (e.g., Stephan & Stephan, 2000) indicated in the broader intergroup literature may be particularly important to consider. Lastly, the cross-sectional nature of the study prevents drawing conclusions of causality. In other words, it is uncertain whether contact reduces transgender prejudice or more prejudiced people avoid contact with transgender individuals. While there are some evidence from experimental (e.g., Ensari & Miller, 2002) and longitudinal (e.g., Levin et al., 2003) studies supporting the causal impact of contact on prejudice in the wider literature, the causal direction of this relationship should be verified in the context of transgender prejudice. Findings from the current study also suggest possible avenues for future research. First, while our findings shed light to the relationship between intergroup contact and transgender prejudice, additional work is needed to examine the link between this type of prejudice and    76 discriminatory behaviors. Prior work points to the complex nature of the relationship between attitude and behavior (e.g., Fazio & Roskos-Ewoldsen, 2005), and there is some evidence to suggest that implicit and explicit prejudice influence different types of behaviors. For example, several studies have shown that implicit prejudice is related to spontaneous nonverbal behaviors (e.g., facial expression, sitting distance, errors in speech, eye contact, etc.), whereas explicit prejudice is related to more deliberate discriminatory behaviors (Dovido et al, 2002; Greenwald et al., 2009). Thus, additional work to deepen understanding of how implicit and explicit transgender prejudice relate to a variety of real-world behaviors is warranted. Moreover, the association between implicit prejudice and subtle behaviors may be of particular value to mental health professionals as those who work with transgender clients and for whom the impact of subtle behaviors on therapeutic effectiveness is of consequence.   Furthermore, although our study found strong support for the applicability of the intergroup contact theory to transgender prejudice, the fact that transgender individuals constitute a small percentage of the U.S. adult population (0.58% according to a report by Flores et al., 2016) suggests the need for future work to explore the efficacy of alternative forms of contact to reduce transgender prejudice. A growing body of literature provides support for the potential utility of indirect forms of contact—such as imagined intergroup contact (e.g., Turner & Crisp, 2010), virtual/parasocial contact (Schiappa, Gregg, & Hewes, 2006), and extended contact (Liebkind and McAlister, 1999)—in reducing various forms of prejudice, which may be productive avenues to pursue in future work. Notwithstanding the limitations mentioned above, as the first study to use Structural Equation Modeling to model the interrelations among key variables identified in the intergroup contact literature in the context of transgender prejudice, findings from the present work extend    77 current knowledge of the nature of the association between contact and transgender prejudice. Sustained effort building upon the present work is needed to continue to advance our understanding of this complex relationship and to apply those findings to develop effective programs to reduce transgender prejudice and improve the lives of transgender individuals.       78 Chapter 5 Conclusions Findings from the two studies conducted as part of this dissertation are significant in that they fill a gap in the existing body of literature concerning transgender attitudes and prejudice. The first study constructed the Transgender AMP, an implicit transgender attitudes measure, with preliminarily evidence of the validity and reliability of its scores. Although further work is needed to garner additional evidence on the soundness of its psychometric properties, the Transgender AMP contributes significantly to the transgender research community in that it provides scholars with a much needed tool to assess a previously largely unexamined construct. With substantial evidence from the social attitudes research indicating the importance of implicit bias in understanding the nature of any type of prejudice, the Transgender AMP holds promise for its use in future studies to advance transgender attitudes research, which would also have implications for educators, practitioners and policymakers.  As one of the first studies to systematically apply the intergroup contact theory to the study of transgender prejudice, the second study, utilizing the newly developed Transgender AMP, provides important insight into how interactions with transgender persons impact  transgender prejudice. In particular, our results showed that frequent interaction was associated with lower levels of implicit prejudice, whereas positive interaction experiences were related to less prejudice both at the explicit and implicit levels. We also found that intergroup anxiety plays a key role in the transmission of the effect of high quality contact to both implicit and explicit transgender prejudice, but that there may be other mechanisms through which frequency of contact impacts implicit transgender prejudice. The more qualified understanding of the associations between contact, anxiety, and transgender prejudice gained through our study offers    79 information that can help tailor interventions to curtail transgender prejudice that capitalize on the intergroup contact effect and suggests additional avenues for further inquiry.  It is our aim that the newly developed measure of implicit transgender prejudice and the findings from the main study will stimulate further work in the still nascent field of transgender prejudice research to continue to clarify and deepen understanding of the nature and causes of this type of prejudice, to produce knowledge that informs public policy that would enhance the overall cultural climate of this country, and to bolster advocacy efforts to improve the lives of transgender individuals in particular.       80 Manuscript 1 References Acker, G.

In this study, we are interested in how people make quick judgements while avoiding distractions.   We will be showing you pairs of words flashed one after the other. The first word is an English word. You should do nothing with the English word; it is simply a warning signal that the second word is about to appear.   The second word is a Chinese character. Your job is to make a quick judgment on how pleasant each Chinese character is on a scale from 3 = Very Unpleasant to 8 = Very Pleasant, using the number keys (3, 4, 7, 8) located at the TOP of your keyboard.   Warning:  It is important to note that sometimes the English words flashed prior to the Chinese characters  can influence people’s ratings of the Chinese characters.   Please try your best not to be influenced by the English words. Instead, please give us an honest judgment of how pleasant or unpleasant your reaction is to each Chinese character. Of course, there are no right or wrong answers. Just report your “gut” reaction.      108 Appendix B IRB Approval Letters Study 1          109 Study 2    ",

    "abstract": "Background: Evidence suggests that transgender individuals face high levels of prejudice, discrimination, and violence. Despite the known negative impact of transgender prejudice, research is lacking on interventions to reduce transgender prejudice. One possible solution might be found in the intergroup contact theory, which has substantial empirical support as an effective strategy to reduce prejudice across diverse populations and situations.  Aims: The present study sought to apply the intergroup contact theory to the study of transgender prejudice. First, the study developed and pilot tested the performance of the Transgender Affect Misattribution Procedure (Transgender AMP), a measure of implicit transgender prejudice. Second, the study examined the direct effects of contact (quality and quantity) on transgender prejudice (explicit and implicit). Lastly, the study explored the mediating role of intergroup anxiety in the relationship between contact and prejudice.Method: First, to develop and test the performance of the Transgender AMP, a three-part study was conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (Study 1). Second, an online MTurk sample of 354 individuals completed an online survey for the main study (Study 2). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) procedures were used for analysis of the survey data.Findings: The Transgender AMP performed as expected and its scores demonstrated preliminary evidence of validity and reliability. Quantity of contact had a unique inverse association with implicit transgender prejudice, whereas quality of contact had a unique inverse relationship with both explicit and implicit transgender prejudice. Intergroup anxiety mediated the relationships between quality of contact and implicit and explicit transgender prejudice, but not quantity of contact and implicit transgender prejudice",
