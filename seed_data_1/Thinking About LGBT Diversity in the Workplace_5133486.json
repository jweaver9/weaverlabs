According to the latest Human Rights \nCampaign Corporate Equity Index, 85% of \nFortune 500 companies’ non-discrimination \npolicies include “sexual orientation” and 43% \ninclude “gender identity.”  Partner benefits are \noffered by a majority, 57%, of Fortune 500’s, \nand 41% offer at least one transgender-\ninclusive health-related benefit.1  \n \nWe see similar progress toward LGBT \nrecognition and inclusion beyond the \nworkplace, as well.  In headline grabbing \nways—this year, the State of New York joins \nConnecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New \nHampshire and Vermont, as well as \nWashington, DC, to legalize same-sex \nmarriage.  Now gay, lesbian and transgender \npeople can choose to legally marry in civil \nsociety using a new marriage license form that \nsimply reads:  Bride/Groom/Spouse—one \nmarriage statute for opposite-sex and same-sex \ncouples; no “separate but equal” provisions.2 \nIn September of this year, the uncomfortable \nand impractical compromise, “Don’t Ask, \nDon’t Tell,” will come to an end as policy for \nthe US military.   \nWe see the progress in more subtle \nprocedural shifts as well—the National \nCompensation Survey from the US \nDepartment of Labor now includes \ninformation on domestic partner benefits \noffered by public and private sector employers.  \nThe US Department of Health and Human \nServices will utilize transgender inclusive \nsurvey questions in a critical national health \nsurvey.  When the FBI releases its report on \nhate crime statistics for 2010, it will include, for \nthe first time, data based on “perceived gender \nand gender identity” bias—an important step \ntoward recognizing this type of violence as \nwrong. \n \n \nThe Workplace as an Environment for \nSocial Change and Learning \nToday, according to a May 13, 2011 report \nby the PEW Research Center, “a majority of \nAmericans, 58%, now say that homosexuality \nshould be accepted, rather than discouraged by \nsociety.”3  There are many reasons for this \nmore inclusive shift in attitudes.  Inclusion of \nsexual orientation, and increasingly gender \nidentity, in workplace inclusion initiatives and \ndiversity awareness dialogue is likely one.  The \nworkplace, driven by the pragmatic need for \nimproved productivity, talent recruitment, and \n2 \n \n \nWORKINGPAPER—Thinking About LGBT Diversity in the Workplace \n2011©Susan Woods/Henderson Woods, LLC    www.hendersonwoodsllc.com \nretention of a motivated workforce, has \nbecome a powerful environment for social \nchange and learning.   \n \nAs diversity practitioners and change \nleaders, we know diversity is about differences \nand similarities and more-than-one-way.  \nLGBT diversity challenges us to understand \nthat what may be right for one person, may not \nbe right for another.  We have learned that \nprejudice and bias are weakened as people \nwork together and learn through positive \nexperience of respectful interaction.  In an \ninclusive workplace, the environment is guided \nby expectations that advance relationship \nbuilding and learning:   \n Work-relatedness  \n Expectation of fairness and consistency  \n Respectful interactions   \nThese criteria are useful when navigating the \napproach to LGBT inclusion. \n \nSexual orientation and gender identity \ndiversity are sometimes labeled as one of the \n“tough,” “emotional,” and “uncomfortable” \nissues in workplace diversity.  Consider the \nsituation of co-workers where one is gay and \nthe other holds deeply religious beliefs that \ncondemn homosexuality.  One has a picture of \nhis partner and their two children at the beach \ndisplayed on his desk.  Both men are standing \nclose, leaning against one another; one has his \narm around the other, the children are kneeling \nbehind a giant sand castle.  His co-worker \ninitially complains that the picture makes her \nuncomfortable and she would prefer not to \ninteract with him.   \n \nApply the criteria.  Her job requires her to \ninteract with him.  His sexual orientation is \nirrelevant to his ability to do his job as is hers, \nto her ability.  It would be unfair and \ninconsistent to allow her to display pictures of \nher family in her workspace while denying him \nthe same benefit.  In this situation, respect may \nmean mutual recognition that they disagree.  \nBeing “uncomfortable” is a common \nreaction when confronted with what is \nunfamiliar and recognized as unsafe, risky, or \nbreaking stereotypical social norms.  LGBT \nworkers are a minority for whom sexual \norientation, gender expression and/or gender \nidentity are everyday considerations.  For \ngender conforming employees, these aspects of \npersonal identity are often deeply assumed, \nnever questioned.  Consider, for example, \nbeing able to dance with one’s partner at a \ncompany event, being referred to with the \nappropriate pronoun or being able to share \nstories about your family life and children \nwithout fear of rejection, ridicule or physical \nviolence. \n \n“Uncomfortable” can be thought of as the \nflipside of “unfamiliar.”  A white person may \nfeel “uncomfortable” when asked for the first \ntime to explain if he or she prefers to be called \nCaucasian or white, and with a little or capital \nW.  If a heterosexual person is “uncomfortable” \nwhen asked about their sexual orientation, it \nmay be because they’ve never really thought \nabout it as dimension of their own diversity.   \n \nThe same diversity skills that facilitate \nrelationship building across other dimensions \nof diversity—open-mindedness, the ability to \nsee things from more-than-one-way, \nanticipating ambiguity, flexibility, criteria-\nguided thinking, and a strong sense of one’s \nown self-worth—apply to sexual orientation \nand gender identity.  LGBT diversity \nchallenges us all to recognize that what’s right \nfor one person’s identity does not necessarily \nimply anything about another’s. \n \nMost of us grew up thinking about \nsex/gender as two distinct, all inclusive \ndimensions:  male or female, man or woman, \nsimple as that.  Nature is more complex.  The \nCenter for Gender Sanity diagramed the \ncomplexity in a way that helps sort through the \nconfusion.4  How we understand ourselves is a \ncombination of: 1) our biological sex \ndetermined by anatomy, chromosomes and \nWORK  \nRELATEDNESS \nFAIRNESS &  \nCONSISTENCY \nRESPECT \n3 \n \n \nWORKINGPAPER—Thinking About LGBT Diversity in the Workplace \n2011©Susan Woods/Henderson Woods, LLC    www.hendersonwoodsllc.com \nhormones, 2) our gender or psychological \nsense of self, 3) the way we express gender as \nmasculine, feminine or androgynous, and \nfinally 4) our sexual orientation defined by \nattraction to the opposite sex, same sex, both \nor neither.  A person who has transitioned \nfrom female to male, for example, may or may \nnot be gay.  A man whose style and expression \nseem feminine may be straight. \n \nThe LGBT community is highly diverse \nwithin itself.  Identity is a combination of our \nbiology, psychological sense of self and how \nwe choose to express ourselves.  None of us is \nwithout a sexual orientation or gender identity.  \nIn the workplace, LGBT diversity is about \nrecognizing these dimensions of identity; it is \nnot about sexual activity.  Providing a means to \nunderstand this complexity reduces fear and \nlays the groundwork for open-mindedness, \nempathy and acceptance.   \n \n \nProgress is Far from Complete \nSeveral recent national studies of the \nexperience of LGBT people at work document \nthe persistence of discrimination in \nhiring/firing, promotion, performance \nevaluation, pay and benefits as well as verbal \nharassment, bullying and physical violence.5  \nLGBT people report lying about their personal \nlives, feeling depressed, avoiding people and \nsocial events, and feeling distracted at work \nand exhausted.  To diversity practitioners and \nchange leaders, the effects on talent \nrecruitment, retention, productivity, and \nemployee health and well-being are recognized.  \nHow LGBT workers are treated sends signals \nto others who question what would happen to \nthem should they challenge perceived norms.   \n \nThe effects on people and on the \nworkplace are serious and similar to \nacknowledged dynamics with other types of \nbias, with perhaps one exception.  LGBT \nidentity is not necessarily visible.  Gay, lesbian \nand transgender workers must contend with \nthe issue of “being out” and fear of “being \nouted.”  Diversity practitioners have long \nrecognized the cost of “having to check your \nidentity at the door.”  Closeted workers suffer \nincreased sense of isolation, anxiety, stress, and \ndistraction from work.   \n \nOpenness is a complex issue, deeply \npersonal and private while at the same time \nhaving strategic implications for career and the \nquality of day-to-day engagement with others \non the job.  The Power of Out, a new study by the \nCenter for Work-Life Policy, found that LGBT \nemployees who are out at work are less likely \nto feel stalled in their careers, more likely to \nfeel satisfied with their rates of promotion and \nadvancement and more likely to trust their \nemployers.6   \n \nAccording to research by the Human Right \nCampaign, most employees who are not open \nto anyone at work say they do so because it’s \nnobody’s business.  Others fear making people \nuncomfortable, being stereotyped, losing \nrelationships, hurting chances for promotion, \nbeing perceived as unprofessional, or being \nfired, attacked or humiliated.7  \n \nPerceptions about workplace climate \ngreatly influence this decision.  GLBT \nemployees are alert to subtle and not-so-subtle \nmessages of exclusion, everything from the \nabsence of inclusive terms like “partner” in \npolicy language to managers who appear visibly \nuncomfortable or tolerate anti-gay jokes to co-\nworkers who leave the room, don’t speak, \nexpress stereotypes, use derogatory labels or \nspread rumors.  As with other types of \ndiversity, seeing openly LGBT people \nsuccessfully advance careers makes a \ndifference. \n \n \nFramework for Creating LGBT Inclusion \nInclusive LGBT policy goes beyond \nspecifying sexual orientation and gender \nidentity in non-discrimination language and \ndomestic partner health benefits.  Policy \nmakers should consider how domestic \n4 \n \n \nWORKINGPAPER—Thinking About LGBT Diversity in the Workplace \n2011©Susan Woods/Henderson Woods, LLC    www.hendersonwoodsllc.com \npartners’ family, parents and children, are \nincluded in various family benefit policies such \nas adoption assistance, bereavement leave, \nCOBRA benefits contribution, employee \ndiscounts, employer provided life insurance, \nfamily leave, parental leave, relocation \nassistance, retiree medical coverage and \nsupplemental life insurance.8  For transgender \nemployees, it’s especially important that health \ninsurance plans not contain clauses exempting \ntransgender employees from needed medical \ncoverage like counseling by a mental health \nprofessional and hormone therapy.9  Employee \nresource groups focused on LGBT issues \nprovide valuable information and insight. \nAs diversity change practitioners, we know \nthat policy on the books is the starting point; it \nbecomes real when put into practice.  Ed \nMickens, writing in the mid-1990’s, outlined \nthree areas of concern for LGBT inclusion: \nsafety, acceptance and equality.10  These \nconcerns continue today to provide a useful \nframework for thinking through inclusive \npolicy, awareness and skill-building, and \nworkplace culture change. \nLGBT inclusion can be explored by asking \nwhat needs to be in place to promote: \n Safety from ridicule, harassment, bullying \nand violence \n Acceptance to foster understanding, \ngoodwill and relationship building \n Equality to ensure non-discrimination, \nrecognition of full lives and respect for the \nintegrity of relationships and families \nAs with other aspects of inclusive policy, it’s \nimportant to think through how policy \nbecomes practice, how inclusion will be \ncommunicated, implemented and supported.  \nDiversity and inclusion often pushes us \nbeyond our comfort zones.  We are asked to \ndismantle backlash, to recognize stereotypes, \nand to keep an open-mind for learning from \nthe experience of diverse others.  We are \nchallenged to reexamine our own identities, to \nsurface deeply rooted assumptions, and to \nlearn new ways to understand the complexity \nof human reality, including our own.  When \nworking with employee and manager groups, \nthe same skills and approaches that are useful \nwith other dimensions of diversity are useful \nhere.  A workplace environment guided by \nexpectations for work relatedness, fairness and \nrespect is well suited for advancing recognition \nand inclusion of LGBT people. \n \n \n \nReferences & Resources \n1.

In NY, marriage equity legislation includes language that “no government treatment or legal status, effect, right, \nbenefit, privilege, protection or responsibility relating to marriage, whether deriving from statue, administrative or \ncourt rule, public policy, common law or any other source of law, shall differ based on the parties to the marriage \nbeing or having been of the same-sex rather than a different sex.”  This is significant because it extends to same-\nsex couples the host of rights and responsibilities that have been extended to opposite sex married couples.  It \nmeans that in NY, for example, the state tax code will be amended to exempt employer-provided domestic partner \nbenefits to equalize the state tax treatment of benefits for all spouses.  In the federal sector, the Defense of \nMarriage Act, DOMA, requires employers to impute the fair market value of partner benefits so those benefits can \nbe treated as taxable income. \nhttp://www.nyhealth.gov/vital_records/marriage_equality_frequently_asked_questions.htm   \nhttp://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/memos/multitax/m11_8c_8i_7m_1mctmt_1r_12s.pdf  \nSAFETY \nACCEPTANCE \nEQUALITY \n5 \n \n \nWORKINGPAPER—Thinking About LGBT Diversity in the Workplace \n2011©Susan Woods/Henderson Woods, LLC    www.hendersonwoodsllc.com \n3.
