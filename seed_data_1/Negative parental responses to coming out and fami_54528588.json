B. Willoughby •Fiorenzo LaghiPublished online: 27 March 2014\u0002 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014Abstract Parental responses to youths’ coming out (CO)are crucial to the subsequent adjustment of children andfamily. The present study investigated the negativeparental reaction to the disclosure of same-sex attractionand the differences between maternal and paternalresponses, as reported by their homosexual daughters andsons. Participants’ perceptions of their parents’ reactions(evaluated through the Perceived Parental Reactions Scale,PPRS), age at CO, gender, parental political orientation,and religiosity involvement, the family functioning(assessed through the Family Adaptability and CohesionEvaluation Scales), were assessed in 164 Italian gay andlesbian young adults. Pearson correlation coefficients werecalculated to assess the relation between family functioningand parental reaction to CO. The paired sample t test wasused to compare mothers and fathers’ scores on the PPRS.Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to analyzethe relevance of each variable. No differences were foundbetween mothers and fathers in their reaction to the dis-closure. The analysis showed that a negative reaction toCO was predicted by parents’ right-wing political conser-vatism, strong religious beliefs, and higher scores in thescales Rigid and Enmeshed. Findings confirm that a neg-ative parental reaction is the result of poor family resourcesto face a stressful situation and a strong belief in traditionalvalues. These results have important implications in bothclinical and social fields.Keywords Coming out \u0002 Disclosure \u0002 Lesbian and gayyoung adults \u0002 Parental reactions \u0002 Family functioningIntroductionThe coming-out (CO) process, defined as the sharing ofone’s sexual orientation with others, has been described asan essential component in lesbian and gay (LG) identityformation and integration (Cass 1979; Legate et al. 2012).Identity integration includes acceptance of one’s gay, les-bian, or bisexual identity, and sharing this aspect of the selfwith other individuals. Previous researches have indicatedthat CO process may have positive effects on relationshipswith others (e.g., improving authenticity of a friendship),the construction of self-identity, and mental health (e.g.,decreased hypervigilance/anxiety) (Baiocco et al. 2012;Shilo and Savaya 2011; Vaughan and Waehler 2010).Erikson’s model of sexual identity development (1959,1982) posits that certain stages and ‘‘tasks’’ must be nav-igated successfully to form a healthy personality. Theseeight steps go through the implementation of tasks con-cerning trust, differentiation, autonomy and the manage-ment of doubts, fear and conflict, inside the family and thesociety (Erikson 1982). According to this point of view,CO can be assimilated into a developmental task. For LGadolescents, this process may be growth-enhancing eventand is highly important to developing an integrated identityand for strengthening self-esteem (Henry 2013). SuchR. Baiocco (&) \u0002 L.

However, despite the potential benefitsof CO, there are also associated stressors, which can have adeleterious impact on physical and psychological health(Frost et al. 2013). These stressors can include familyrejection, bullying, discrimination and prejudices (Frostet al. 2013; Guzzo et al. 2014). The CO process may alsoplace significant strain on family relationships, cause inter-parental conflict, and exacerbate parent mental healthissues (e.g., Willoughby et al. 2008). Given this, a strongand cohesive family, displaying adequate resources tomanage stressful situations, may provide a supportiveenvironment for the LG adolescent who decides to comeout. The majority of LG young people often do not haveaccess to positive models (i.e., parents often do not sharethe same sexual orientation) and their families may rejecttheir sexual orientation (Bos et al. 2004). In the Americancontext, research indicate that as many as 52 % of parentsmay initially react negatively to their child’s disclosure ofsame sex attractions (D’augelli et al. 2008). The negativeconsequences of rejecting reactions from parents rangefrom depression (Legate et al. 2012), negative LG identity(Willoughby et al. 2010), and substance abuse (Baioccoet al. 2010) to, in some extreme cases, suicide (Ryan et al.2009). On the other hand, a supportive and positive familyenvironment is associated with positive young adult healthoutcomes, such as low level of internalized sexual stigma,depression and suicidal idealization, and high level ofsocial support and self-esteem (Baiocco et al. 2012;D’Augelli and Grossman 2001; Hoffman et al. 2009; LoCascio et al. 2013; Pace et al. 2012; Resnick et al. 1997;Russell 2003; Ryan et al. 2010).Italy, where the present study was conducted, is afamily-oriented society in which adolescents and youngadults are more extensively involved with their extendedfamilies than members of other Western societies (Baioccoet al. 2013; Pallini and Laghi 2012). LG men in Italy fre-quently confront a roster of biases and prejudices and agreater level of gender segregation in their daily lives(Lingiardi et al. 2012). Previous studies in Italy, in fact,have found high levels of internalized sexual stigma in gayand lesbian adolescents and young adults (Baiocco et al.2010, 2012; Lingiardi et al. 2012). Thus, a supportivefamily environment becomes extremely significant, sinceItalian culture is characterized by a great level of gendersegregation. Widespread heterosexism in society estab-lishes that the only normatively acceptable sexual behav-iors are heterosexual (Herek and Garnets 2007). In Italy,LG adolescents and young adults encounter many diffi-culties and may be afraid of disclosing their sexual orien-tation because of unfavorable outcomes such as socialrejection and discrimination, which are realisticpossibilities.Parental rejection at the time of disclosure is a strong,negative event that can affect all aspects of an adolescent’slife, and it is crucial to understand how this reaction iselicited and how to support parent, child, and familyadjustment following the disclosure. This process is welldescribed by the Family Stress Theory (Patterson 2002),developed with the purpose of explaining how and whystressful events negatively affect the wellbeing of thefamily and, as already underlined, the disclosure could beone of these events.According to this theory, within which the presentresearch is developed, parental reactions to CO is the resultof three main elements: a family’s relational capabilitiesand competences, family members’ beliefs about meaningsof stressful events, and the amount of stressors thatundermine family stability (Willoughby et al. 2008).Family-based resources, such as cohesion, adaptability, andflexibility, may represent valuable predictors to understandhow the family will react to their child’s CO (Carnelleyet al. 2011). The literature underlines how families, withadequate relational capacities, coping abilities, and a higherlevel of resilience, often face difficult events in supportiveways, such as displaying a more positive reaction to theirsons and daughters’ sexual orientation disclosures (Laveeand Olson 1991; Willoughby et al. 2006).As mentioned above, CO to family, especially to par-ents, is often the biggest challenge for same-sex attractedyoung people (Savin-Williams 2005; Savin-Williams andReam 2003; Savin-Williams and Dube 1998). However,despite the risk of disapproval and victimization, themajority of gay and lesbian adolescents decide to come outto their parents (LaSala 2000). A handful of studies (Ben-Ari 1995; D’Augelli et al. 2002; LaSala 2000; Saltzburg2004; Savin-Williams 2001; Willoughby et al. 2006) haveexamined parents’ initial reactions to their youth’s CO.Literature underlines the relevance of the following vari-ables for predicting parents’ negative reactions to CO:parental age (i.e., older parents react more negatively;Baiocco et al. 2013; Savin-Williams 2001), lower levels ofparental education (Conley 2011), involvement in tradi-tional religious associations (Baiocco et al. 2013b; Schope2002), traditional values about family and marriage(Newman and Muzzonigro 1993), and more traditionalattitudes regarding sex roles (Cramer and Roach 1988).Concerning those factors, parental reaction is affected bythe meaning each member of the family gives to the dis-closure. This process involves not only religious beliefs,political ideology, but also cultural and educational back-grounds. If one or both parents hold preexisting negativebeliefs and values about homosexuality, then they may berepulsed by the disclosure (Cramer and Roach 1988). MoreJ Child Fam Stud (2015) 24:1490–1500 1491123specifically, these beliefs affect their personal beliefs aboutthe causes of homosexuality: believing that homosexualityis learned rather than, for example, genetic; holding gayand lesbian individuals responsible for their lifestyle; andsupposing they have some control over their sexual ori-entation (Sakalli 2002).Findings indicate fathers’ and mothers’ may react dif-ferently to their child’s CO. Several studies reveal thatmothers were likely to respond more positively to disclo-sure than fathers (Armesto and Weisman 2001; Ben-Ari1995; Boxer et al. 1991; D’Augelli and Hershberger 1993;D’Augelli et al. 2002; Maguen et al. 2002; Savin-Williamsand Dube 1998). Some studies, however, have found thatmothers may be perceived to react more negatively thanfathers (Willoughby et al. 2006), show greater concerns/worries (Conley 2011), and a display a greater amount ofanger and guilt than fathers.Regarding differences in reactions to the CO of lesbiandaughters versus gay sons, Conley (2011) found that par-ents’ overall concern was higher for gay sons. In addition,referring to youth characteristics that are predictive ofparental reactions, some studies found that reaction wasmore negative when the child was of the same gender asthe parent (D’Augelli 2006), and more negative foryounger adolescents than older adolescents and youngadults (LaSala 2000). However, others studies did notconfirm these findings (D’Augelli et al. 2005; Heathe-rington and Lavner 2008).From a systemic point of view, disclosure has beendefined a ‘‘whole family experience’’ (Baptist and Allen2008) and a phenomenon that is ‘‘interpersonal in nature’’(Mohr and Fassinger 2003), pointing out that it is a salientevent involving all family members. The family, as asystem, may be an important predictor of parental reactionsto sexual orientation disclosure (LaSala 2000). Accordingto the Family Stress Theory, parent–child relationships andpre-existing resources can buffer the effects of an eventthat shifts several aspects of the family system, such asexpectations and desires, and can lead to adopting newroles inside the family. Additional variables related to theoutcome within the family include: pre-existing level ofcloseness and conflict in the parent–child dyad, the timespent together, importance of parents as a source of socialsupport (Heatherington and Lavner 2008), economicindependence (Gardner et al. 2014), availability of othersources of support (Chaudoir and Fisher 2010), and indi-viduals’ assessment of the cost/benefit for themselves andfor their parents (Green 2000).Understanding the CO process and the variables related to anegative family response is an important aspect for the designand delivery of LG youth services. The present researchexamines the different parental responses to the CO of youths,and the elements associated with parents’ reactions, from theperspective of their daughters and sons. The current studyaims to identify the differences between mothers’ and fathers’responses, and the individual factors that can affect, positivelyor negatively, how parents are perceived to react to theirchild’s disclosure. The specific research questions addressedin this study are as follows: (a) do perceptions of reactions toCO differ for mothers versus fathers and (b) are perceivedparental reactions related to the gender and the age of the son/daughter. We expected that a more negative parental responseis related to younger ages of the children and, when the child’ssex is the same of his/her parent (D’Augelli 2006; LaSala2000; Saltzburg 2004; Savin-Williams 2001). The currentstudy also addresses these additional questions: (c) doesparental religious beliefs and political conservatism predictperceived parental reactions (Cramer and Roach 1988;Newman and Muzzonigro 1993; Schope 2002) and (d) isproblematic family functioning predictive of more negativeperceived parental reactions to CO (De Vine 1984; Wil-loughby et al. 2006).MethodParticipantsData were collected for 164 participants: 71 women(43.3 %) and 93 men (56.7 %), who self-identified as gayor lesbian, based on the Kinsey Scale (Kinsey et al. 1948).Nearly half, or 46.1 %, of the young adults came from thecenter of Italy, 30.4 % from the south, and the 24.5 % fromthe north of Italy. In this study, we did not include bisexual(3.7 %) and transgender participants (1.2 %), due to thelow number of respondents in these categories. Partici-pants’ ages ranged from 18 to 26 (Mwoman = 23.21,SD = 1.97; Mmen = 23.41, SD = 2.15). Participantsaveraged 15 years of education, which means they reportedcompleting the second year of college (Mwoman = 14.72,SD = 3.11; Mmen = 15.25, SD = 2.64).ProceduresParticipants were recruited from lesbian, gay, bisexual, andtransgender (LGBT) organizations (31 %) and three LGBTcollege student organizations (69 %) in Rome, Italy. Theprerequisites for inclusion were: Respond to the KinseyScale at level 5 and 6 (where 5 meaning almost completelyand 6 meaning completely homosexual); be between 18and 26 years old; have already revealed their sexual ori-entation to both parents; be Italian; and, finally, the parentshad to be a couple and to living together (not divorced orseparated) at the time of CO. All participants respondedindividually to the same questionnaire packet, which wasadministered face-to-face by trained psychologists.1492 J Child Fam Stud (2015) 24:1490–1500123Participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous,and participants were encouraged to answer as truthfully aspossible. The participants took about 20–25 min to com-plete the questionnaires. A total of 98.1 % of question-naires were completed. Before the data collection wasstarted, the protocol was approved by the Ethics Com-mission of the Department of Developmental and SocialPsychology of the Sapienza University of Rome.MeasuresA Background Information Questionnaire was completed byparticipants. Demographic information, like age, education,religion, and disclosure status was collected. Sexual orien-tation was evaluated using the Kinsey Scale (Kinsey et al.1948). This scale offers six possibilities, ranging from 0(people who defined themselves as completely heterosexual,without any experience or desire for homosexual activity) to6 (those who declared themselves as exclusively homosex-ual). Data about parents’ level of education and religiousaffiliation were collected as well. Moreover, we asked par-ticipants to report the age at which they came out to parentsand to describe the way in which their parents knew/dis-covered their sexual orientation (‘‘How did your mother/father discover your sexual orientation?’’; 1 = I personallytold it to my mother/father; 2 = My mother/father asked meabout my sexual orientation; 3 = My mother/father dis-covered it; 4 = Other persons revealed my sexual orienta-tion to my mother/father).Parents Religiosity Involvement was measured by twoitems, asking participants to report the frequency of theirparents’ attendance of religious service (‘‘How often doesyour mother/father usually attend religious services?’’;0 = never, 10 = several times per week), as well as theimportance of religion in their parents’ lives (‘‘Howimportant is religion in your father life/mother life?’’;0 = not important, 10 = extremely Important). Since thecorrelation between these two items was high (r = .72), atotal score was obtained by summing the responses to eachitem, which we considered as a general measure of parents’religiosity involvement (Roth et al. 2012).Political orientation was measured by asking partici-pants to report the political orientation of the parents on a5-point Likert Scale ranging from 1 = completely left to5 = completely right, so that higher scores indicatedgreater right-wing conservatism.The Perceived Parental Reactions Scale (PPRS; Wil-loughby et al. 2006) assessed participants’ perceptions oftheir parents’ reactions to sexual orientation disclosure.Participants were asked to think back to the time whendisclosure occurred and, using a 5-point Likert scale,indicate agreement or disagreement with severalstatements. PPRS included 64 statements, 32 related to themother and 32 to the father. Higher scores indicated morenegative perceptions of their parents’ reactions (‘‘My momyelled and screamed’’), with scores ranging from 32 to 160.In a previous study (Willoughby et al. 2006), the PPRSshowed item-total correlations of .40 and above and dem-onstrated good internal consistencies. Test–retest reliabilityhas also been established. In the present study, the internalconsistency reliability was .95 for the mother version and.86 for the father version.Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales(FACES IV; Olson 2011) was used to evaluate familyfunctioning of participants. The FACES IV is composed by42 items (as ‘‘Family members are involved in each otherslives’’ or ‘‘There is no leadership in this family’’). On aLikert-type scale divided into six scales: two balancedscales (Cohesion and Flexibility) assessing central-moder-ate areas and four unbalanced scales (Rigid, Chaotic,Enmeshed, and Disengaged) assessing the lower and upperends of Cohesion and Flexibility; family global functioningscore was obtained by dividing the sum of the Cohesionand Flexibility scores by 2 (Olson and Gorall 2006). Whilethe two balanced scales are similar to previous FACES IIIscales, the four Unbalanced Scales—Enmeshed, Disen-gaged, Chaotic, and Rigid—represent an originalimprovement (Olson 2011). These scales proved to bevalid, reliable, and discriminatory among both problematicand no problematic families (Baiocco et al. 2012; Olson2011), the original FACES IV internal consistency reli-ability ranged from .77 to .89 (Olson 2011), in the Italianversion range from .63 to .73 (Baiocco et al. 2012). In thepresent study, the internal consistency reliability range wasbetween .71 and .76.Data AnalysisTo conduct bivariate and multivariate analyses relating toindependent variables, we used the Statistical Package forthe Social Sciences (SPSS 19.0). Pearson correlationcoefficients were calculated to assess the relation betweenfamily functioning and parental reactions to CO. A pairedsample t test was used to compare means scores of mothersand fathers on the Perceived Parental Reaction Scale.Univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used toassess differences in gender of the son/daughter and genderof the parents regarding parental reactions using familyfunctioning and age as covariate. Post hoc analyses fol-lowing ANCOVAs were carried out with Duncan’s test todetect group differences (p \\ .05). Next, hierarchicalmultiple regressions were conducted to investigate therelevance of family functioning and individual variables topredict parental reactions to CO.J Child Fam Stud (2015) 24:1490–1500 1493123ResultsMaternal and Paternal Reactions to Coming OutPaired sample t test was used to compare means scores ofmothers and fathers on Perceived Parental ReactionsScale. No differences were found between mothers(M = 80.93; SD = 27.86) and fathers (M = 75.50;SD = 30.42) in their reaction to the CO of their son/daughter (t163 = 1.54, p = .13). The correlation betweenmothers and fathers was high (r = .52), and the intra-classcorrelation was significant (Z = 6.66; p \\ .001). In addi-tion, no differences were found between the age of the COwith the mothers (M = 19.15; SD = 2.81) and fathers(M = 19.45; SD = 3.11) (t163 = 1.59, p = .11). Differ-ences were found between the way in which, according tothe participants, the parents discovered the sexual orien-tation of their daughters/sons (Chi2 = 10.32; df = 3;p \\ .05). The sons/daughters were more likely to revealtheir sexual orientation directly to their mothers (mothers:65.2 %; fathers: 55.5 %) while the fathers discovered thesexual orientation of their sons/daughters on their own(mothers: 17.7 %; fathers: 32.3 %). Mothers were morelikely to ask the sexual orientation of their sons/daughtersdirectly than were fathers (mothers: 9.8 %; fathers: 5.5 %).Table 1 shows the frequencies of the answers. Moreover,no differences were found in the frequencies of the answersgiven by the sons and the daughters about how parentsknew/discovered their sexual orientation (Chi2 = 6.95;df = 3; p = .07).Parental Reaction to Coming Out, Religiosity, PoliticalInvolvement, and Family FunctioningNo differences were found between mothers (M = 2.46;SD = .87) and fathers (M = 2.57; SD = 1.67). Themajority of the mothers were positioned on the left side ofthe scale (74.4 %), while only 3.7 % were identified ascentrist, and 21.9 % were identified as right-wing conser-vative. Again, the majority of the fathers were positionedon the left side of the scale (53.0 %), while 12.2 % wereidentified as centrist, and 24.8 % were identified as right-wing conservative. Pearson’s correlation was performed toexamine the relation between PPRS dimensions andFACES IV dimensions, religiosity, political conservatism,and age at the time of CO (Table 2).The correlations were found to be as expected, even ifthe strength of these correlations was weak to moderate.The strongest correlations have been found to be betweenthe rigid (rmaternal = .47; rpaternal = .55, p \\ .01) andenmeshed dimensions on FACES IV and the maternal andpaternal reactions to CO (rmaternal = .30; rpaternal = .60,p \\ .01). Also, a strong parents’ political conservatism(rpaternal = .61, p \\ .01; rmaternal = .34, p \\ .01) andhigher parents’ religiosity involvement (rmaternal = .42,p \\ .01) were correlated to a more negative reaction to CO.We conducted Pearson regression analysis in order tounderstand the reasons behind parental negative reaction.Item 2 ‘‘Was worried about what her friends and otherparents would think of her/him’’; item 7 ‘‘was concernedabout the potential that she wouldn’t get grandchildrenfrom me’’ and item 12 ‘‘was concerned about having toanswer other peoples’ questions about my sexuality’’ werevalued with the highest scores, both in paternal andmaternal questionnaires. Table 3 shows the correlationbetween the highest items scores of PPRS and the FACESIV dimensions.Effect of Gender and Age of Child on ParentalReactionsThe average age of CO in the sample was M = 19.26,DS = 2.64, ranged from 12 to 26, Univariate Anova ana-lysis shows no significative differences between womenand men (Mwoman = 18.9, SD = 2.35; Mmen = 19.56,SD = 2.83). From the CO to the present survey havepassed, on average, 4.6 years (M = 4.6, DS = 2.90) withno significative differences between women and male(Mwoman = 4.8, SD = 2.71; Mmen = 4.42, SD = 3.03).Univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) wasused to examine the effects of gender of the son/daughterand the gender of the parent on parental reaction, usingfamily global functioning and age of CO as covariate.Family functioning as a covariate was significant, withF(1, 322) = 10.79, p \\ .001, g2 = .03, as was the age atwhich the son/daughter did the CO: F(1, 322) = 9.36,p \\ .01, g2 = .03. A negative family functioning and alower age of the son/daughter at the time of CO wasTable 1 Frequencies of the way in which parents knew/discoveredthe sexual orientation of the daughter/sonPPRS Mother Father TotalI personally told it to mymother/father65.2 %(n = 107)55.5 %(n = 91)60.4 %(n = 198)My mother/father asked meabout my sexualorientation9.8 %(n = 16)5.5 %(n = 9)7.6 %(n = 25)My mother/fatherdiscovered it17.7 %(n = 29)32.3 %(n = 53)25.0 %(n = 82)Other persons revealed mysexual orientation to mymother/father7.3 %(n = 12)6.7 %(n = 11)7.0 %(n = 23)SD in parenthesis1494 J Child Fam Stud (2015) 24:1490–1500123positively related to a more negative parental reaction toCO.We did not find a significant effect for gender of theson/daughter, F(1,322) = 1.13, p = .29, g2 = .003, orthe gender of the parents F(1, 322) = 2.94, p = .09,g2 = .01. The interaction of gender of the son/daugh-ter 9 the gender of the parents was significant, F(1,322) = 26.12, p \\ .001, g2 = .08. Mothers with a les-bian daughter (M = 92.46; SD = 25.77) reported a morenegative reaction to the CO than did fathers with a gayson (M = 84.50; SD = 25.68). The parents of the othertwo groups (mothers with gay sons and father with les-bian daughters), which do not differ from each other,reported the most positive reactions (Duncan Test;p \\ .05). The magnitude of the effect size was mediumfor the interaction effect, and low for the covariates.Table 4 shows the adjusted means, which are the meansthat we would get after removing all differences that canbe accounted for by the covariates.Predictors of Negative Parental ReactionsNext, using hierarchical multiple regression, we furtherexamined the associations between demographic variables,religiosity, political involvement, family variables, andparents reactions to CO. In the regression, we entered in thefirst step the gender of the son/daughter and the age of his/her CO. Religious involvement and political orientationwere entered in the second step, and the family variables,measured with the FACES-IV, in the third step(Table 5).Table 2 Pearson correlation between variablesVariables 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 121 Maternal reaction 12 Paternal reaction .52** 13 Religiosity mother .42** .31** 14 Religiosity father -.11 .06 -.13 15 Conservatism mother .20** .03 .21** -.23** 16 Conservatism father .34** .61** .21** -.05 .32** 17 Cohesion -.09 -.14 -.08 -.12 -.05 -.16* 18 Flexibility -.20* -.15 -.12 -.08 -.08 -.19* .72** 19 Disengaged family .02 .20** -.01 .08 .07 .27** -.50** -.25** 110 Enmeshed family .30** .60** .21** -.09 .10 .44** -.03 -.09 .19* 111 Rigid family .47** .55** .24** .06 -.06 .31** -.07 -.14 .11 .60** 112 Chaotic family -.01 .07 -.16* -.06 .07 .18* -.18* -.05 .48** .21** .02 1* p \\ .05; ** p \\ .01Table 3 Pearson correlationsbetween PPRS highest scoreditems and FACES IVdimensions** p \\ .001; * p \\ .05PPRSitemsM (DS) Item-totalscorecorrelationCohesion Flexibility Disengaged Enmeshed Rigid ChaoticWas worried about what her friends and other parents would think of her (item 2)Mother 3.14 (1.39) .62** .00 -.06 .010 .24** .39** -.02Father 2.93 (1.52) .64** -.04 -.01 .24** .32** .32** .08Was concerned about the potential that she/he wouldn’t get grandchildren from me (item 7)Mother 3.55 (1.17) .57** .04 -.08 -.08 .26** .38** -.05Father 3.14 (1.33) .54** .05 .04 .00 .27** .42** .01Was concerned about having to answer other peoples’ questions about my sexuality (item 12)Mother 3.28 (1.28) .56** -.02 -.10 .12 .17* .33** -.01Father 3.12 (1.30) .75** -.04 -.06 .18* .46** .43** .07Table 4 Mean score on the Perceived Parental Reactions Scale: theinteraction effect of gender of the son/daughter 9 gender of theparentsPPRS Female Malee TotalMother 92.46 (25.78) 74.78 (25.66) 83.62 (25.89)Father 72.91 (25.67) 84.50 (25.68) 78.71 (25.87)SD in parenthesisJ Child Fam Stud (2015) 24:1490–1500 1495123The analysis of the mother sample showed that a neg-ative reaction to CO was predicted by the gender of theadolescent (having a lesbian daughter) (b = .33, t = 5.36,p \\ .001), lower age at time of CO (b = .15, t = -2.43,p \\ .05), a greater parents’ religious involvement(b = .33, t = 5.20, p \\ .001), a parents’ right-wing polit-ical conservatism (b = .19, t = 3.41, p \\ .01), and higherscore in the scale Rigid of the FACES-IV (b = .38,t = 4.92, p \\ .001). In the father sample, a worse reactionto the CO of the son/daughter, was predicted by a lowerage of the adolescent at the CO (b = .25, t = 4.09,p \\ .001), a parents’ right-wing political conservatism(b = .37, t = 6.90, p \\ .001), and higher score in the scaleEnmeshed (b = .28, t = 3.93, \\ .001) and Rigid (b = .16,t = 2.35, p \\ .05).DiscussionThe present research aimed to analyze the variables con-nected with perceived parental reactions to their child’sCO. To assess participants’ perceptions of their parents’reactions, we administered the Perceived Parental Reac-tions Scale, from which no significant differences werefound in maternal and paternal reactions in the samefamily. This result is inconsistent with the literature, whichsuggests that mothers’ reactions are more negative thanfathers’, as has been seen in Willoughby and colleagues’work (Willoughby et al. 2006); both scores suggesting thetendency for Italian parents to react more positively to theCO of their children, then parents in Willoughby andcolleagues’ sample (Willoughby et al. 2006). Future stud-ies should verify these findings, especially in Italy;according to cross-cultural studies, Italian mothers aremore warm and protective towards their children than arewomen from other countries (Putnick et al. 2012), whichmay have some bearing on an Italian mother’s reaction toher child’s CO.However, despite not finding significant differencesbetween perceived maternal and paternal reactions to CO,differences were found in the ways parents discovered thesexual orientation of their sons/daughters (Table 1).Daughters and sons were more inclined to directly comeout to their mothers versus their fathers, who appear to findout more indirectly. According to the literature, disclosureis a process that occurs in different stages, and CO toparents (D’Augelli 1994) is one of them. Revealing sexualorientation to parents, according to Eriksson model (1982),could bean important task to develop a healthy personality,to differentiate from parents and to win fears. However, thefemale parent seems to be the ‘‘chosen one’’ in the light ofthe trustful relationship that daughters and sons feel theyhave with their mothers (Miller and Boon 1999). Thatbeing so, a maternal negative reaction could strongly affectthe adolescent’s self-esteem and force him/her to assume anegative self-image, in addition to undermines the mother–child relationship (Waldner and Magrader 1999).Nonetheless, as shown in Table 1, it appears frequentlythat parents discovered their daughter’s and son’s sexualidentity by themselves, maybe this could lead to a morenegative reaction, as parents can read the lack of honesty asa lack of trust, or again they can have doubts, worries andTable 5 Hierarchicalregression analyses for familyfunctioning predicting fatherand mother reaction to COThe tabled values for betareflect Bs after step 3* p \\ .05; ** p \\ .001Mother DR2 Father DR2B SEBb R2 B SEBb R2Step 1: Gender and age .10 .10 .22 .22Gender (0 = female;1 = male)-18.42 3.44 -.33** -1.64 3.25 -.02Age at coming out -1.48 .61 -.15* -2.39 .59 -.25**Step 2: Religiosity andpolitical ideology.34 .24 .48 .24Religiosity 2.84 .55 .33** .28 .60 .03Political ideology 6.03 1.96 .19** 6.79 1.09 .37**Step 3: FACES IV subscales .48 .24 .61 .36Cohesion .36 .40 .09 -.21 .38 -.05Flexibility -.65 .43 -.13 -.02 .42 -.00Disengaged family .12 .42 .02 .41 .41 .07Enmeshed family -.12 .44 -.02 1.7 .44 .28**Rigid family 1.9 .38 .38** .87 .37 .16**Chaotic family -.38 .40 -.07 -.81 .38 -.14Total R .70 .781496 J Child Fam Stud (2015) 24:1490–1500123being ashamed to talk about that with their sons anddaughters.Results reported in Table 2 show a correlation betweena negative perceived maternal and paternal response and aparents’ perceived right-wing conservative political view;the same correlation has been found between maternalnegative reaction and parents’ strong religious involve-ment. These data, in line with the literature (Newman andMuzzonigro 1993; Schope 2002), suggest that believing inconservative traditional values can be a predictor of sexualprejudice. In countries such as Italy, where religious feel-ings are ingrained in the culture, it is not unusual for LGBTpeople to experienced religion-based homophobia (Baioccoand Laghi 2013; Cartabia 2008; Herek 2000; Lingiardiet al. 2005, 2012); these experiences can prevent or delaythe disclosure for fear of rejection. This result deserves tobe analyzed more deeply. As has been seen, mothers withhigher levels of religious belief and fathers with strongconservatism and right-wing political views are more likelyto react in a negative way. In Italy, it is a cultural given thatmothers are the ones who take care of the house, which canbe seen as the ‘‘private-family thing,’’ while fathers havethe tendency to be concerned with the ‘‘public-socialthing,’’ e.g., politics. Women, in the past, were not sup-posed to participate in political debates or go into politics,but they were responsible for the religious education oftheir daughters and sons. It is likely that in the more con-servative families, aspects of this legacy remain, and thiscultural phenomenon can explain current findings (JuradoGuerrero and Naldini 1996).Concerning the relationship between a negative parentalreaction and FACES IV dimensions, the data in Table 2show a strong correlation with enmeshed dimensions forboth parents. These results, along with the literature (Bai-occo et al. 2013a; De Vine 1984; Willoughby et al. 2006),support the hypothesis that poor family functioning (lack ofadaptability, no coping ability, poor resilience resources,lack of communication) is predictive of a negative parentalreaction to the adolescent/young adult’s CO. The disclo-sure about sexual orientation in an enmeshed family couldbe difficult for several reasons: the strong bonds betweenthe family’s members can limit the individual growth andchoices, so much so that almost any expression of inde-pendence or separateness is seen as disloyalty to the fam-ily. Highly enmeshed families are likely to have highlyemotional interactions and the revelation can generatestrong feeling of delusion in overly dependent parents and,as a consequence, feelings of guilty in their daughters andsons (Baiocco et al. 2013a). Or, again, the parent’s identitycould be so wrapped up in their child’s identity that makesthe acceptance of the disclosure really complicated.Table 3 shows the correlations between the highest PPRS’items scores and the family functioning. Three Item 2, item7 and item 12 have been valued with the highest scoresboth for fathers and mothers. These data suggest that bothparents are worried about what other people, friends andrelatives could think about their sons and daughters sexu-ality (item 2 and 7): These items could reflect deep feelingsof shame about having a homosexual daughter or son;parents can fear the judgment of others people, maybeabout their parental skills and they are afraid to speak aboutthat. These items shows higher correlations with Enmeshedand Rigid family functioning, along with the results alreadypresented: In these family it seems fundamental to keep theappearance from the outside, and it is possible that theyprefer to keep the disclosure inside the family, and notmention about it to friends or others relatives (as it has beenseen in Rivers and Gordon 2010). Item 12 is more culturalrelated, and reflect the belief that only a couple formed by amen and woman can have children and, as a consequence,it opens a narcissistic wound in the parents who see theirdesire to become grandparents fading away.According to our results, the age of the son/daughter atthe time of CO is an important predictor of parental reac-tion. The lower the age of the participants at the time ofCO, the worse the reaction of both parents, which confirmsour hypothesis (D’Augelli 2006; LaSala 2000; Saltzburg2004; Savin-Williams 2001). ANCOVA analysis revealsthat both parents react worst to same-gender adolescents’disclosure. From a paternal point of view, the CO of a maleson can be seen as a failure to successfully pass on mas-culinity, and fathers can feel deepening feelings of shame,which make them unwilling to discuss the disclosure andparticipate emotionally in the event (LaSala 2010). Fur-thermore, the analysis of the interaction between son/daughter and parental gender shows that mothers with alesbian daughter display a more negative reaction to thedisclosure than do fathers with a gay son. According toPearlman (2012), who has collected 24 stories of motherswith lesbian and transgender daughters, the maternalreaction seems to be so negative because of the hurt anddisappointment as they see all their dreams for theirdaughter’s future unravel; this is followed by feelings ofloss of the mother–daughter bond, which they now feelmore as a mother–son relationship (Pearlman 2012). Or, asalready said, mothers where also responsible for the emo-tional socialization of their daughters and sons, homosex-uality could be seen as a failure in this task and they‘‘blame’’ themselves for that. Nevertheless, as the presentresearch is focus on the participants perception of theirparents reaction, there is an interesting explanation for thisphenomena given by Chiari. According to her data, lesbiandaughter tend to ascribe feeling of disapproval to theirmother and feelings of worry to their fathers, more thanmale sons: This could be an effect of interpersonaldynamics of identification and projection with theirJ Child Fam Stud (2015) 24:1490–1500 1497123reference parental figure. The young lesbian daughterperceives a more negative maternal reaction due to the gapbetween herself and the object of identification, and, as aconsequence of this process, she overestimates the disap-proval reaction (Chiari 2006).The association between sex, age, religiosity, politicalinvolvement, and family dimensions has been examinedthrough step-wise hierarchical multiple regression in orderto identify the predictors of parental negative reaction(Table 5). Maternal negative response is mostly predictedby: having a lesbian daughter, the age at the time CO,religious association, and a right-wing conservative polit-ical view. On the other hand, paternal negative response ismostly predicted by a lower age of the son at the time ofCO and right-wing political conservatism.Both maternal and paternal negative reaction are con-nected to a higher score in the Rigid scale of the FACES IV(mother b = .38, t = 4.92, p \\ .001; father b = .16,t = 2.35, p \\ .05). According to the literature, rigid familiesare characterized by overly low levels of flexibility andadaptability, which are the family’s main resources to facestressful and unexpected situations and keep the internalcohesion (Mathis and Tanner 1991; James and Hunsley1995). Our results reveal, moreover, that a negative parentalreaction is also predicted by a higher score on the FACES IVenmeshed scale (b = .28, t = 3.93, p \\ .001), which ischaracterized by higher levels of cohesion, an extremeamount of emotional closeness, and strong demands onloyalty. In this situation, the disclosure can be seen as anunexpected betrayal of the expectation and values of thefamily. These results suggest that when the family is dys-functional and displays strong boundaries-related problems,the parental reaction to CO can be extremely negative.The inability to reframe perceptions, ideas, and infor-mation about their son/daughter, can damage the family’sbonds, leading to, on one hand, losing marital stability and,on the other hand, make the child feel guilt and rejection(Olson and Lavee 2013; Willoughby et al. 2008). For anadolescent/young adult who decides to reveal his or hersame-sex attraction under these conditions, internalizingthe minority sexual stigma could be a concrete possibility,the negative consequences of which are well known in theliterature (Frost et al. 2013; Willoughby et al. 2008).In conclusion, our findings confirm that a negative parentalreaction results from poor family resources to face a stressfulsituation, a strong belief in traditional values, a lower age attime of CO, and—for mothers—having a lesbian daughter.These results have important implications in both clinical andsocial fields. First of all, in therapeutic and counselingassessment, it is fundamental to understand these variableswhen focusing the intervention, in order to prevent a negativeparental reaction to CO on one hand, and on the other hand tohelp the family to accept the disclosure and readjust thefamily’s boundaries. Also, when the social group and thefamily have strong religious affiliations and particularlyconservative political views, a message of homophobia hasbeen internalized, and this can jeopardize the process ofacceptance of the disclosure. Due to their social importance,these results can be tested also in other southern Europeregions, where the cultural values are similar to Italian’s one.Nevertheless, disclosing to family about sexual identity is animportant step for every young LG, and these findings couldbe helpful for social and clinical workers in every Country.Homophobia and social marginalization of adolescents andyoung adults is still a reality in Italy, and we hope that ourfindings can help family therapists, counselors, and educatorscreate a supportive and welcoming environment to daughtersand sons who decide to take the difficult choice of CO.LimitationsThere were a few limitations to our study. First the sample wasrelatively small; a larger and more representative sampleshould be studied to obtain more stable results. The study wasconducted in Italy, and these findings may not apply to LGmales living in other countries, since our data appear to bestrongly related to our culture. Also, the use of a conveniencesample can never truly access a representative sample of LGindividuals. The sample was composed by young adults, itwould be interesting to investigate the experience of adultsand older people, in different times of life. Moreover therecould have been some bias regarding the perception of neg-ative parental reaction, maybe perceived as more negativethan it actually was. In this regard it would be interesting totake a longitudinal study, in order to analyze whether the timeelapsed since the CO, has a particular influence on parentalreaction’s perception. Finally, the study did not considerbisexual participants, once again due to the low number in oursample; likewise, it is necessary to explore how the CO ofbisexual adolescents is perceived by their parents, and toverify if the differences between maternal and paternal reac-tions are the same as for the homosexual sample.ReferencesArmesto, J.

    "abstract": "Parental responses to youths' coming out (CO) are crucial to the subsequent adjustment of children and family. The present study investigated the negative parental reaction to the disclosure of same-sex attraction and the differences between maternal\r\nand paternal responses, as reported by their homosexual daughters and sons. Participants' perceptions of their parents' reactions (evaluated through the Perceived Parental Reactions Scale, PPRS), age at coming out, gender, parental political\r\norientation, and religiosity involvement, the family functioning (assessed through the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales, FACES IV), were assessed in 164 Italian gay and lesbian young adults. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relation between family functioning and parental reaction to CO. The paired sample t-test was used to compare mothers and fathers' scores on the PPRS. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to analyze the relevance of each variable. No differences were found between mothers and fathers in their reaction to the disclosure. The analysis showed that a negative reaction to coming out was predicted by parents' right-wing political conservatism, strong religious beliefs, and\r\nhigher scores in the scales Rigid and Enmeshed. Findings confirm that a negative parental reaction is the result of poor family resources to face a stressful situation and a strong belief in traditional values. These results have important implications in both clinical and social fields",
