If the Oscar’s have taught us nothing, it is that one can thank \neveryone in the world and still fall short of stating adequately their gratitude for those who \nhave supported them in their endeavors toward their accomplishments. I begin first with my \ncommittee. To Dr. Myra Washington, I am grateful for not only your time and extensive \nediting efforts, but also for your keen and insightful perspectives. This project would not be \nwhat it is without the contribution of your brilliance! You helped me to see my own \nperspectives more clearly, helped me to write about them more effectively, and pushed me to \ngo beyond what I thought I was capable of doing. You patiently endured my self-doubt \nthroughout this process and helped me to be more centered in my approach to scholarship as \na whole. I wholehearted thank you for your contributions to this project. \n To Dr. Mary Jane Collier, for your countless hours of “heavy-handed” editing, I am \neternally grateful. You have made me a better writer and self-editor. You helped me learn \nhow to review my own work and become a more independent scholar. But more importantly, \nyou helped me come into my own as a critical scholar and activist. I did not realize when I \ncame to UNM that I would we walking amongst giants, and it has been a great honor to work \nwith and learn from you. And in many ways, I got much more than just an advisor out of you. \nI saw in you facets of the kind of scholar I want to be, and you have supported not only my \nacademic journey, but I always felt that you supported me as a person as well—through all \nthe extra-special struggles that accompany completing this PhD journey. You have truly \nimpacted my life for the better. \n\t\t\niv \n To Dr. Shinsuke Eguchi, I will be forever grateful for your presence on my committee \nand introducing me to an entire new world and perspective on who I am as a person and the \nscholarship I want to contribute to. I can still remember the first week of the semester, you \ninvited me to meet with you, and I told you that I identified as a lesbian, and you very \nintentionally asked me: You don’t identify as queer? Which opened up a conversation that \nhas been expanding and growing for the past five years. You have always offered your \nsupport, and I truly appreciate your insights that push me to think deeper and in more \ncomplex ways. \n To Dr. Charles E. Morris III, thank you for your willingness to be a part of my \ncommittee. Being a household name in Critical Rhetoric, I am certain you have many \nstudents who want to work with you—so it has been an honor to have you on my committee. \nBeing my outside committee member means I did not get as many opportunities to interact \nwith you as my other committee members, but your insights and willingness to engage my \nproject is meaningful to me, and I sincerely appreciate your contributions to this project. \nAdditionally, to Sharon Bernstein, thank you for helping me to restablize through one \nof the most difficult experiences of my life that might otherwise have derailed the completion \nof this project. And to Natalie Smith, for helping me through some exceptionally difficult \nmoments throughout my program, and for providing the theoretical frameworks through \nwhich I could see (in addressing my positionalities) that my personal experiences with this \ntopic are truly a sight of trauma—making it possible for this study to help others who \nexperience similar traumas in being marginalized by their sexual identities. Thank you for \nyour willingness to share with me your own experiences so that I might accept my own. I \nwill be forever grateful for your vulnerability—a word that does not come easily for you. \n\t\t\nv \nThank you for teaching me about betrayal that I might learn to forgive—something no one \nwants to go through whilst pursuing a PhD, but which forced me to see the strength within \nmyself to survive. Only from the woman who taught me the most about dialectics could the \ntheory of (lie)alectics emerge. I hope one day that my research will make a difference in this \nworld and help people in the ways you try to help people and influence the world. It was an \nhonor to work with you. \nTo all of my family and friends who have supported me, it is impossible to \nencapsulate everything I want to say. To my parents, Paul and Gayle, for all of your \nemotional and financial support through this process, I am eternally grateful. To my siblings: \nBill, Wayne, Capri, Heather, and Bronwyn, thank you for your undying support as the bestest \nsiblings in the world who have accepted me for who I am from the very beginning. To my \ncohort: Noorie, Godfried, Emily, Jose, Gabby, Mario, Lisa, and Stephen—you were my rock, \nand it has been a privilege to call you not just friends, but family. I am grateful for your \ncontinued presence in my life, and I am grateful for the overall opportunity UNM provided \nme with to engage the caliber of people who I get to call family, friends, and colleagues. \n\t\t\nvi \n(LIE)ALECTICS AND THE DISCURSIVE DEQUEERIFICATION OF POLITICAL \nSPACES BASED ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS: A CRITICAL RHETORICAL \nANALYSIS OF THE MORMON AND GAY WEBSITE \n \nBY  \nMYRA N. ROBERTS \nA.A., General Studies, Portland Community College, 2004 \nB.A., Speech Communication, Oregon State University, 2008 \nM.A., Interdisciplinary Studies, Oregon State University, 2011 \n \nABSTRACT \n \n  \nOver the past decade, sexual orientation and identity has increasingly been added to \nstate and federal anti-discrimination laws, prompting a rhetorical situation by the Christian \nRight in attempts to exempt themselves from upholding anti-discrimination laws pertaining \nto sexual identity and orientation. This study analyzes the Mormon and Gay website—a \nwebsite dedicated to advancing the position of the Mormon Church on issues of non-\nheterosexuality. Utilizing rhetorical textual analysis, I develop two theoretical frameworks: \n(lie)alectics and dequeerification to demonstrate how the discourse under examination \nattempts to appear non-homophobic while maintaining homophobic church doctrine. I argue \nthat this model stands to influence the First Amendment in extending the Free Exercise \nclause to allow religiously-identified individuals to police and punish non-heterosexual \nbehaviors. Additionally, this research calls for the reinforcement of the Establishment clause \nof the First Amendment, which restricts the federal government from establishing a national \nreligion or to privilege one religion over another. Ultimately, this research functions as a \nform of activism, which highlights the discourse published on the Mormon and Gay website \nas discriminatory and not a step towards acceptance as it represents itself. \n\t\t\nvii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nCHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION ..................................................................................  1 \n A Self-Reflexive Beginning

We will \nstand as witnesses of God, at all times, and in all things, and in all places, as we \nstrive to live the young women’s values, which are: Faith, Divine Nature, Individual \nWorth, Knowledge, Choice and Accountability, Good Works, Integrity and Virtue.  \nWe believe as we come to accept and act upon these values, we will be prepared to \nstrengthen home and family, make and keep sacred covenants, receive the \nordinances of the temple, and enjoy the blessings of exaltation. (Young Women \nPersonal Progress, 2009, p. 2) \n \nAs a young Mormon girl, I remember learning this motto and repeating it every \nSunday at the beginning of the Young Women’s session of my weekly church meetings. \nEven at the young age of 12, I not only knew the ideological assumptions expected of a \nfaithful Mormon woman, but I could recite them from memory. The “Personal Progress” \nprogram, from which this motto is derived, is designed to help young Mormon girls “prepare \nfor [their] future roles as faithful [women], wi[ves], mother[s], and leader[s] in God’s \nkingdom” (Young Women Personal Progress, 2009, p. 2). From the ages of 12-18, I attended \nchurch regularly and was actively engaged in the Young Women’s program. In so doing, my \nidentity as a young Mormon woman—soon to be Mormon wife and mother—was \nsuccessfully internalized…or at least I had deceived myself into thinking that it was. I held \nchurch leadership positions within the Young Women’s program, was always the first one to \narrive and last to leave church service projects and activities, and was always willing to give \ntalks and bear my testimony during church services. Pious. Yes, pious might be the most apt \nword to describe my formative years within the Mormon Church. But despite the fact that I \nwas doing everything that a faithful Mormon girl should do, internally, I always felt as \n\t\t\n2 \nthough I was pretending. And I was. I had a secret—that deathly secret that so many god-\nfearing people dread: I was gay. Am gay. And even though I tried as hard as I could to \neradicate this part of myself (everything short of an exorcism), by the time I was in my \ntwenties, I could no longer deny the underlying emotional tensions I felt at the realization \nthat I did not want to get married (at least not to a man) or to be a mother.  \nYet these realizations only fueled a need for me to reinforce my faith, because I had \nconvinced myself that I had felt the spirit of God testify to me the truthfulness of the \nMormon gospel and because living in a community comprised predominantly of other \nMormons, the social backlash was too great for me to comprehend withstanding. So, I would \nperiodically return to my Patriarchal Blessing—a blessing given to church members (usually \naround the age of 16) that provides insights into the individuals’ predestination—that assured \nme that I was predestined to “enjoy the friendship of young men and from these men choose \none as my eternal companion” and that I would be “a handmaiden of the Lord, standing tall \nwith a radiant countenance for all to see in the times of spiritual darkness,” and that if I was \nworthy, I would “take part in the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, and come forward on the \nmorning of the first resurrection, clothed in robes of glory.” \nWhile discouraged, members of the church would often share their blessings with \nfriends and families as a way to compare spirituality, and compared to other blessings I read, \nI was destined to be a spiritual rockstar! I was preordained to bring people out of spiritual \ndarkness and would tower over others in my spirituality and righteousness as part of the elite \nA-List Mormons who would usher in the Second Coming of Christ himself. I had every \nreason to cling to these beliefs—a reassurance that I would be among God’s favorites—a \npsychological need I desperately craved being the youngest of six children being raised in the \n\t\t\n3 \nchaos of a mother with severe mental illness. I needed the church to be true. I needed God to \nwant me—to be special and not just another inconvenience at the tail end of a troubled \nfamily. So, when my sexuality was at odds with church teachings, I found creative \ninterpretations that allowed me to keep my spiritual belief system intact. The clause stating \nthat I would “enjoy the friendship of young men and from these men choose one as my \neternal companion” became a belief that God had created a way for me to still get married by \nallowing me to choose my eternal companion. And, the declaration that I would be “a radiant \ncountenance for all to see in the times of spiritual darkness,” became a belief that my triumph \nover my sexuality would be a tool in God’s hands for me to tell my story and bring others to \nthe gospel. Yet, this was a tightly-wound balancing act that was not sustainable, and \neventually I would sway too far to one side or the other, lose my balance, and find myself in \na state of spiritual and existential crisis unable to distinguish true from false, right from \nwrong, or even real from fake. \nReflecting back, my first longstanding wavering of faith was actually not in response \nto my sexuality. It was in response to a lesson I received during church services where my \nspiritual leader made the comment that those born in “third world countries” had been born \nin the circumstances God intended them to be born, and that it was indicative of \nunrighteousness in the pre-existence (i.e., people deserved what they got in life because it \nwas somehow indicative of wickedness before they were even born). That conceptualization \nran so counter to who I needed God to be—a loving, good-natured father with his children’s \nbest interest at heart. And for the first time, the more I prayed, the less I felt at peace. This \nbelief sat sour inside of me for years before I would begin to see the parallel of my spiritual \nleaders telling me that God had given me this “challenge” because there was something I \n\t\t\n4 \nneeded to learn from the circumstances that I was born into. My best efforts aside, I began to \nrealize that I would never be the pinnacle righteous wife and mother my upbringing had \ntaught me I should want to be. Even though I wanted to, I could not reconcile the parts of my \nidentity that grated against the characteristics of a “righteous daughter of God,” established \nby Mormon doctrine, and slowly my faith began to unravel as I fell spectacularly from the \nglory I believed I had been promised. \nYet, even as I sought to shed the copious layers of the Mormon ideologies with which \nmy identity had been draped, I struggled to do so. Those ideologies that we are raised with, \nthose filters we are taught to see the world through, are so intricately woven into our identity, \nthat it is difficult (if not impossible) to completely abandon them, even when they abandon \nus. The first time I read Gloria Anzaldúa “Not me sold out my people but they me,” (p. 3) \nwas the first time I realized how truly “stuck” I was in this liminal space of religion and \nsexuality—how long I had lived with a dirty butterfly-bandage holding together the two sides \nof a bloody wound that refused to heal. I began to wonder the extent to which I had \ncontributed to the suffering of others by perpetuating this set of beliefs that so clearly creates \ninjuries not heals them. So, I begin this project with this narrative to not only set the stage for \nthe motivation for this study, but also to act as the justification for investigating an \nideological system that has clear racist and homophobic roots as a means of providing an \nanalysis that can act as counter-discourse in challenging and interrupting the impact of \nreligious ideologies pertaining to positionalities. \nProblem Statement, Rationale and Research Goals \nProblem Statement \nThe founding of the United States (US) has often been referenced as a place people \n\t\t\n5 \nfled to for the exercise of religious freedoms. Indeed, woven into the very structure of the US \nconstitution is the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause limiting the ability of Congress \nto make any law that prohibits the free exercise of religion. However, defining free exercise \nof religion has been anything but stable. With nearly 50 landmark Supreme Court cases, the \nFirst Amendment’s claims to religious freedoms have been debated, defined, redefined, and \noverturned over the past 138 years. Beginning with the 1878 Reynolds v. United States \nSupreme Court case, the court differentiated between religious beliefs and religious practices \n(Cornell Law School). This case regarded the indictment of George Reynolds on the charge \nof bigamy. Reynolds, being a practicing member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \nSaints (more commonly known as the Mormon Church1), argued that the law was \nunconstitutional and deprived him of his First Amendment rights to freely practice his \nreligion. The Supreme Court ruled that religious duty was not a defense against criminal \nactions insofar as placing religious beliefs as superior to the laws of the land would in effect \n“permit every citizen to become a law until himself” (Reynolds v. United States, p. 98). As \nanti-polygamy laws threatened the disincorporation and escheatment of church assets to the \nFederal Government, the Mormon Church published the 1890 Manifesto aligning church \ndoctrine with federal laws regarding marriage (Official Declaration 1, n.p.).  \n Today, the religious doctrines and beliefs of the Mormon Church are once again at \nodds with US marriage laws since the legalization of same-sex marriage in the Obergefell v. \nHodges Supreme Court case. Legalizing same-sex marriage required redefining the \n“traditional definition of marriage,” a term used by Chief Justice Roberts (2015) in his \ndissenting testimony, stating that the petitioners are “not seeking to join the institution, [but] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 From this point forward, I will reference The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by \ntheir commonly ascribed label of Mormon/Mormonism/The Mormon Church \n\t\t\n6 \nseeking to change what the institution is,” (p. 5) suggesting that marriage—by “traditional” \ndefinitions—is an institution of unity between a man and a woman. Aligning with this \n“traditional” definition of marriage, the Mormon Church’s rejection of same-sex practices \nhas been predicated upon the supposition that sexual relations are only condoned between \nmarried individuals—doctrines that were legitimized by the US Federal Government’s failure \nto recognize same-sex marriage. Thus, the legalization of same-sex marriage undercuts \nMormonism’s rationale and justification for the exclusion of same-sex couples from \nmembership. That is, if same-sex couples are allowed to marry, this disrupts the Mormon \nChurch’s claims to marriage being the defining characteristic that determines the morality of \nsexual acts, and grounds for excommunication if those sexual acts are deemed immoral or \nsinful. As such, in response to this change in legislation, high-ranking Mormon officials have \nparticipated in multiple public addresses asserting/reasserting Mormonism’s religious beliefs \nand practices regarding sexual orientation—providing justifications for why the church will \nnever condone same-sex relationships. This discourse being produced by the Mormon \nChurch is problematic because it seeks to position this traditionally homophobic religious \nentity as non-homophobic because of its willingness to recognize sexual identities, while still \nseeking to exempt religious organizations from substantiating same-sex marriage, the very \ninstitution it claims legitimizes sexual expression. The potential of this discourse to shape \npublic policy surrounding religious freedoms sets a trajectory for reversal and/or exemptions \nto anti-discrimination laws that would leave protected classes vulnerable to the infiltration of \nany person claiming religious freedoms as the justification for refusal to adhere to anti-\ndiscrimination laws. \nRationale and Research Goals: The Development of (Lie)alectics \n\t\t\n7 \nIn my initial investigation of the rhetorical significance of these discourses being \nproduced by the Mormon Church surrounding LGBT2 rights, I examined a press conference \nissued by the Mormon Church three months prior to the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court \ncase. This press conference entitled Religious Freedoms and Nondiscrimination, issued on \nJanuary 27, 2015 called for stronger laws to protect LGBT individuals, while also calling for \nstronger laws protecting “Religious Freedoms” (RFs)3. During this conference, these officials \ncalled for a protection of RFs while juxtaposing advocation for “nondiscrimination” (ND)4 \nfor LGBT citizens in areas of housing, employment, and public accommodations, attempting \nto position RFs and ND dialectically. My analysis of the Religious Freedoms and \nNondiscrimination press conference revealed the employment of a stylistic maneuver that \nallows the church to appear inclusive of LGBT legislation as a means of substantiating their \nclaims to RFs. To accomplish this, the church attempts to position itself dialectically with the \nLGBT community calling for legislation that protects both RFs and ND, representing these \nprinciples as dialectical opposites. However, what emerged from the analysis of this \ndiscourse revealed a stylistic maneuver more akin to a (lie)alectic: a term I use to describe \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2 Both within and outside of the academy, there are several acronyms used to identify sexual \nidentities (i.e., LGBT, LGBTQ, LGBTQI, LGBTQIA, LGB-and Trans, among others). For \nthe purposes of this research, I use the acronym of LGBT when referencing Mormon \npublications, because that is the way it is referenced in the discourse being analyzed. When \nreferencing broader applications, I use the acronym LGBTQ because it is currently the most \ncommonly utilized acronym. \n \n3 I use the acronym RFs when specifically referencing the discourse of the “Religious \nFreedoms and Nondiscrimination” press conference. All other references to religious \nfreedoms will be spelled in full and in lower case. \n \n4 Similarly, I use the acronym ND when specifically referencing the discourse of the \n“Religious Freedoms and Nondiscrimination” press conference. All other references to \nnondiscrimination will be spelled in full and in lower case. \n \n\t\t\n8 \nhow the discourse appears to be inclusive of multiple truths (both, and…), but when \nexamined closely, pairs/compares concepts that are not antithetical in nature, and thus \nbecomes a discourse of exclusion (yes, but…).5 For example, the church reports to have \nsupported ND against the LGBT community in “fair access to housing and employment,” but \nthen goes on to state that when these issues of nondiscrimination force “People of Faith” \n(PoF) to go “against his or her own conscience,” then RFs become dialectically \nincommensurate with ND. When examined through a lens of religious determinism, this \npositioning usurps the rights of LGBT individuals, and is thus a discourse of exclusion rather \nthan inclusion. \nThis positioning happens in three ways. First, as noted in the above example, they \nclaim support of LGBT rights insofar as they have supported previous LGBT legislation. \nSecond, they claim they are not attempting to deny the LGBT community of their rights, but \nrather, that in addition to legislation supporting LGBT rights, there also must be stronger \nlegislation protecting RFs. For example, during the press conference, Elder Dallin H. Oaks \n(one of the presenters) expressed that the timing of the press conference was in response to \nthe fact that: “Today, state legislatures across the nation are being asked to strengthen laws \nrelated to LGBT issues in the interest of ensuring fair access to housing and employment,” \nand later goes on to say “At the same time, we urgently need laws that protect faith \ncommunities and individuals against discrimination and retaliation for claiming the core \nrights of free expression and religious practice that are at the heart of our identity as a nation \nand our legacy as citizens” (Newsroom, 2015). In this way, the Mormon Church is arguing \nthat only some of the human rights guaranteed to all US citizens ought to be applied to \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n5 The theoretical application of (lie)alectics will be further developed in Chapter four \nregarding methodology and theoretical framework. \n\t\t\n9 \nLGBT identified individuals. They argue that the law ought to privilege RFs which would \nallow PoF to act in accordance with their beliefs, even when those beliefs marginalize the \nLGBT community and run counter to their human rights. Last, it positions itself (and other \nPoF) as equally discriminated against because they are not allowed to “raise their voice in the \npublic sphere” without public backlash. Thus, the discourse attempts to represent RFs as \njustifiably discriminatory. Additionally, it attempts to rezone discrimination to include PoF6 \nand situate them as a marginalized community with equal claim to social justice. \nMy interest in initially analyzing religious discourses surrounding LGBT rights \nemerged from the significance of the timing of the press conference in its proximity to the \npassing of several religious freedom bills mirroring the rhetorical strategies of the Religious \nFreedoms and Nondiscrimination press conference. Legislation exempting religious \norganizations from observing federal laws protecting LGBT rights has been passed in several \nstates (including Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, and Missouri). Indiana Governor \nMike Pence (now Vice President of the US) passed Bill 101 entitled the Religious Freedoms \nRestoration Act, (RFRA) on July 1, 2015. Since that time, 20 states have passed RFRA laws \nand an additional 16 states have proposed RFRA legislation. Additionally, following the \npassing of same-sex marriage, Weatherby (2015) highlights the continuation of this \nmovement stating:  \nThe tension between religion and civil rights will undoubtedly continue to play out. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n6 Furthermore, I argue that the press conference’s use of the term “People of Faith” is \nreferencing only Christians, insofar as the only examples used in the text are in reference to \nChristian denominations (i.e., Later-day Saints, Catholics, etc.) and/or Christian officials \n(i.e., pastors, bishops, etc.). Additionally, I define Christians/Christianity broadly as any \ndenomination recognizing the New Testament as scripture and/or a source of doctrine, the \nMormon Church included under this definition. \n \n\t\t\n10 \nConservative states deeply rooted in religion will push back with legislative measures, \nsuch as overly robust state religious freedom laws, that aim to find a loophole around \nthe court’s same-sex marriage decision. (n.p.) \n \nIndeed, as legislation has pushed to challenge and define some religious tenets, \ndoctrines, and practices as discriminatory, conflicts between the First Amendment’s \nguarantee of religious freedoms, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of \nnondiscriminatory practices, have been in growing struggle during the past 75 years. Crowley \n(2007) examines this phenomenon in Tolerance and the Christian Right, arguing that since \nthe 1970s when “previously disenfranchised groups sued for admittance to civic \nparticipation,” Christian intellectuals have “redefined the liberal value of tolerance as a \nradical relativism that restrains Christians from passing moral judgments on beliefs and \npractices of which they disapprove” (p. 102). \nFurthermore, in the past two decades, the Human Rights Campaign, as well as \nindependent and grass-roots efforts, have influenced the changing of legislation, which \noverturned legislation that marginalizes the LGBT community (e.g., repealing sodomy laws, \nDon’t Ask Don’t Tell, and DOMA), paving the way for same-sex marriage. These changes in \nlegislation have fueled efforts by the Christian Right (including the Mormon Church) to \ncreate discourses influencing public policy that would exempt those claiming religious \nfreedoms from upholding anti-discrimination laws pertaining to sexual orientation and \nidentity. In the development of the rationale and research goals, I argue that the Religious \nFreedoms and Nondiscrimination press conference is a primary example of how this \nproposed legislation is being developed and the extent to which it has the potential of shaping \npolicies that directly impact the material realities of LGBTQ-identified individuals. \n\t\t\n11 \nThis study seeks to explore further applications of the (lie)alectics rhetorical strategy \ndiscovered in the Religious Freedoms and Nondiscrimination press conference. Since the \nproduction of the Religious Freedoms and Nondiscrimination press conference, the Mormon \nChurch has continued to articulate and publish their standpoint that “feelings of same-sex \nattraction are not a sin and we can choose how to respond” (Mormon and Gay, 2016).  These \ndiscourses included a press conference released on November 5, 2015 aimed at clarifying the \nchurch’s decision to change its policy on baptism for children being raised in same-sex \nhouseholds.7 Additionally, following the Boy Scouts of America’s (BSA) decision to lift its \nban on allowing gay men to be troop leaders (following a lawsuit in 2015), the Mormon \nChurch responded with a statement that they found this “deeply trouble[ing]” and that “the \ncentury-long association with Scouting will need to be examined” (Newsroom, 2015). Then, \nin May 2017, the church released a statement that beginning in 2018, the church will no \nlonger participate in the BSA. In this statement, the church suggests that its decision to \nwithdraw from the BSA is not due to the organization’s transgender policy change; yet, in a \nstatement emailed to NPR the church “evinced some displeasure with the organization’s \nadmittance of openly gay leaders and transgender boys in recent years” (NPR, 2017). I \nprovide these examples to demonstrate the Mormon Church’s active production of anti-gay \nand homophobic rhetoric, not only to its own congregations and members, but also in public \nforums including television, radio, and internet publications. \nResearch Rationale. Of specific interest to this study is the Mormon Church’s \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n7 Prior to this change in policy, minors (under the age of 18) needed parental consent to be \nbaptized into the Mormon Church without regard to the sexual orientation of their parents. \nNew policy states that “children living in a same-sex household may not be blessed as babies \nor baptized until they are 18. Once they reach 18, children may disavow the practice of same-\nsex cohabitation or marriage and stop living within the household and request to join the \nchurch” (Christofferson, 2015, n.p.). \n\t\t\n12 \ncurrently published website entitled Mormon and Gay. The website includes statements \nabout the Mormon Church’s beliefs regarding LGBT individuals and policies, as well as \nstories of “gay Mormons”—those individuals who claim the identity of “gay” AND choose \nto live a celibate life to remain compliant with church policies and retain membership in the \nchurch. I analyze the Mormon and Gay website’s collection of discourses to determine the \napplicability of the theoretical framework of (lie)alectics to better understand the impacts of \ndiscourses that employ these strategies, the implications of these strategies, and the potential \nof this discourse to shape public policy.  \nThe discourse of the Mormon and Gay website, in comparison to all religious \ndiscourse being produced surrounding LGBT issues, is warranted for several reasons. First, \nthe theory of (lie)alectics emerged out of the examination of previous Mormon discourse, and \ntherefore testing the generalizability of (lie)alectics to other Mormon discourse is important \nbefore expanding to other religious discourses and beyond. Second, the Mormon and Gay \nwebsite is largely aimed at members of the church, in comparison to the Religious Freedoms \nand Nondiscrimination press conference, and therefore stands to offer a new perspective of \nhow (lie)alectics can be utilized to reinforce ideologies within church members to avoid \nlosing membership. Third, the Mormon and Gay website is one of the only websites (of this \nscale8) published by a religious organization in the US declaring the church’s position on \nLGBT issues (i.e., this discourse is unique from other discourses because of the level of \norganization and mass distribution employed). The next closest website of this scale is the \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n8 The Mormon and Gay website is a full-scale, multi-static page website including videos, \ntestimonials, stories, and links to the official www.lds.org website published by the Mormon \nChurch. Additionally, the website has been translated into 37 different languages, a unique \nfacet of this website, which makes it accessible to a wider audience than any other website \nhosted by a religious organization pertaining to stances on LGBT issues. \n\t\t\n13 \nWestboro Baptist Church’s God Hates Fags website, which is only endorsed by the \nWestboro branch and not the Baptist church as a whole. \nAdditionally, I specifically look at discourses being generated by the Mormon Church \n(rather than a comparative study) for several reasons. First, the Mormon Church’s affluence \npositions them in such a way as to allow the church to hold national press conferences \nproclaiming their beliefs in public forums. Reports estimate that the Mormon Church \nreceives approximately $7 billion annually in revenue via tax-exempt tithing from church \nmembers (Henderson, 2012). This does not include other offerings available to church \nmembers in the form of “Missionary Funds” and “Fast Offerings”—other donations accepted \nby the Mormon Church. Second, the Mormon Church has historically supported anti-gay \nlegislation, gaining national attention and criticism for its estimated $8.4 million financial \ncontribution in supporting Proposition 8—the proposed amendment to the California State \nConstitution to outlaw same-sex marriage (mormonsfor8.com). Third, according to the \nNational Council on Churches, Mormonism is the second-fastest growing church in the US \n(Newsroom, 2017), reporting an increase of 248,218 members during 2016—a total church \nmembership of 15,882,417 as of December 2016 (Church Statistical Records). Consequently, \nthis increase in church membership stands to increase Mormonism’s annual tithing revenue \nand increases the number of individuals espousing and perpetuating homophobic discourse. \nResearch Goals. This study addresses the following goals through critical \nexamination of the Mormon and Gay website. First, this examination seeks to expose the \nunderlying anti-gay ideologies inherent in the text through identification of (lie)alectical \nstructures in the discourse. Second, this examination seeks to provide a way to assess the \nimplications of these (lie)alectical structures to reinforce heteronormative ideologies and act \n\t\t\n14 \nas a preemptive counterstrike to perceived threats on dominant conservative Christian’s \ndiscriminatory doctrines regarding LGBT issues. Third, this examination seeks to extrapolate \nthe potential of such discourses to shape state and federal US policies that directly impact the \nmaterial realities of LGBTQ-identified individuals. \nConclusion \nIn this chapter, I argue the exigence for examining emerging religious discourses that \nhave the potential to marginalize the LGBTQ community in the US. I substantiate the \ninfluential potential of the Mormon Church to impact legislative choices in exempting those \nclaiming religious freedoms from upholding anti-discrimination laws pertaining to sexual \norientation and identity. To that end, I situate the Mormon and Gay website as problematic \ndiscourse because it seeks to position this traditionally homophobic religious entity as non-\nhomophobic by portraying itself as wiling to recognize sexual identities, while still seeking to \nexempt religious organizations from substantiating anti-discrimination laws. The potential of \nthis discourse to shape public policy sets a trajectory that will leave protected classes \nvulnerable to the infiltration of any person claiming religious freedoms as the justification for \nrefusal to adhere to anti-discrimination laws. \nThe discourse on the Mormon and Gay website warrants textual analysis because the \ntheory of (lie)alectics emerged from examination of previous Mormon discourse, and \nexamining a larger artifact produced by the Mormon Church stands to demonstrate the \ngeneralizability of (lie)alectics to Mormon discourse, which will provide the building blocks \nfor determining further applications of (lie)alectics. Additionally, the Mormon and Gay \nwebsite is arguably the most in-depth publicly published website by a religious organization \nregarding LGBT-related issues, and examination of Mormon discourse is of additional value \n\t\t\n15 \nbecause of the affluence and growth rate of the organization and their history of supporting \nanti-gay legislation, demonstrating the potential of these discourses to take root in public \npolicy. Furthermore, I propose three research goals aimed at identification of anti-gay \nmessages within the text, contextualize those structures, and provide implications of the \nidentified messages. In chapter two, I provide background and context regarding homophobia \nin the US, evolution of US policies surround LGBTQ rights, a history of the Mormon Church \nand its doctrine, and a summary of the Mormon and Gay website to provide the context from \nwhich the analysis will be performed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\n16 \nCHAPTER 2 \nBACKGROUND AND CONTEXTUALIZATION \nTo further develop the justification for this study, I first provide a brief history of the \nevolution of LGBTQ policies and legislation in the US to substantiate the conflict between \nLGBTQ rights and religious discourses. I also outline current proposed legislation affecting \nLGBTQ-related public policy in the US to develop the exigence of examining and \nchallenging this discourse. Second, I provide an overview of major doctrinal tenets of the \nMormon Church to contextualize the ideological assumptions being made in the discourse. \nLast, I provide an overview of the Mormon and Gay website to contextualize the quotations \nutilized in the analysis chapter. \nContextualizing Homophobia in the US \n The contextualization of LGBTQ politics is important to understanding the rhetorical \nsituation (Bitzer, 1968) that has emerged out of the evolving gay rights movement in the \nUS—particularly the rapid changes made to LGBTQ legislation during the Obama \nPresidential Administration9—as the backdrop upon which religious discourses seeking to \nexempt religious organizations from upholding anti-discrimination laws pertaining to sexual \nidentity as a protected class has emerged. This contextualization demonstrates the ways in \nwhich legislation in the US has largely been impacted by the ideological assumptions of the \nChristian Right surrounding issues of homosexuality and LGBTQ policies, how the influence \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n9 Note Morris’s (2015) queering of rhetorical history and his reflection on Obama’s influence \nin queer politics stating: “We’ have freed ourselves, not that the president knows, or has \nspoken, our history,” (p. 226) noting the erasure of the groundwork of activism preceding the \nObama administration in advancing LGBTQ rights, while simultaneously acknowledging \nObama’s fervent efforts in seeking a “more perfect union for many LGBTQ peoples, \nindelibly invoking the past…for a particular vision of a brighter future” (p. 238). \n\t\t\n17 \nof the Christian Right has lost ground over the past 60 years, and how recent legislation has \ncreated pushback by the Christian Right in the development of discourses (such as the \nMormon and Gay website) that seek to exempt themselves in the face of a trajectory of \nLGBTQ rights in the US mirroring the sentiment of Obama’s Second Inaugural Address, \nstating: “Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like \nanyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit \nto one another must be equal as well” (Obama, 2013, n.p.). From this place, I begin with the \nhistorical applications of LGBTQ policies in the US including historical and current \nlegislation and court cases. \nHistorical Applications of LGBTQ Policies in the US. Homosexuality has had an \nevolutionary position in US politics, published as a mental disorder until the DSM IV in \n1987, criminalized until 2003 in the Lawrence v Texas Supreme Court Case, gays were \nbanned from the military until 2011, and unable to marry until 2015. I provide a brief \noverview of the policies, court cases, and major protest events to provide the backdrop upon \nwhich my claim that (lie)alectics function as a preemptive counterstrike to perceived threats \non religious freedoms in being forced to substantiate federal legislation supporting LGBTQ \nrights. Particularly under the Obama Presidential Administration, the gay rights movement \ngained momentum repealing several discriminatory laws toward the LGBTQ community and \npassing of laws protecting LGBTQ citizens and advancements in equality. Indeed, at a \nreception for LGBTQ Pride Month, Obama declared that, as a nation, we are “reaching a \nturning point,” and that “Hearts and minds change with time. Laws do, too.” \n(whitehouse.gov). As laws increasingly reflect Obama’s sentiment here—that the hearts of \nthe American people are changing toward an acceptance of LGBTQ lifestyles—pressure on \n\t\t\n18 \nconservative (Christian dominated) discourses to appear non-homophobic through the \nerasure of explicitly homophobic language has increased. As will be demonstrated in the \nanalysis of this research, in its place, (lie)alectical structures emerge as an implicit tactic that \nallows dominant ideologies (i.e., heteronormativity) to be perpetuated in a way that reduces \nthe perceived validity of counterhegemonic voices—reinforcing dominant ideologies. That \nis, the progression of gay rights has created a rhetorical situation—a coming to a head—as \nthe historical infiltration of Christian-based opposition to homosexuality has been losing \nground over the past nine years. From this, discourses claiming upholding gay rights as a \nviolation of religious freedoms have emerged and continue to grow in momentum as the \ncurrent presidential administration repeatedly appoints government officials that support anti-\ngay and homophobic policies. \nCriminalization. According to Eskridge (2009) sodomy laws in the US—largely \ntargeting sex between members of the same sex—were inherited from British criminal law \nwith roots in Christianity. As early as 1779, Thomas Jefferson wrote into The Founders \nConstitution of Virginia, Amendment VII listing sodomy alongside rape and polygamy as \ncriminal acts with a punishment of castration in men and “cutting thro’ the cartilage of [a \nwoman’s] nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least” (The Papers of Thomas \nJefferson, n.p.). Sodomy was considered a felony prior to 1962, and even after the \nintroduction of the Model Penal Code (MPC)—an attempt to standardize laws amongst \nstates—many states retained sodomy laws criminalizing homosexuality. Yet, it would not be \nuntil 2003 in the Lawrence v Texas Supreme Court case that sodomy laws were deemed a \nviolation of 14th Amendment’s rights to due process, invalidating all state sodomy laws, and \nthus decriminalizing homosexuality. \n\t\t\n19 \nLegislation and Court Decisions. Following the decriminalization of homosexuality, \nthe constitutionality of many discriminatory laws against LGBTQ citizens came into \nquestion, but none so notable as those occurring in the Obama Administration—arguably the \nfirst presidential administration to openly support the gay rights movement—between 2008-\n2016. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, the official policy regarding homosexuality in the US Military, \ninitiated in 1994 was overturned in 2011. DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act), signed into law \nby President Bill Clinton in 1996 was overturned nearly 20 years later in 2013. The US \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal \nOpportunity issued regulations prohibiting LGBTQ discrimination in federally-assisted \nhousing programs in 2012. The legalization of same-sex marriage in the Obergefell v Hodges \nSupreme Court case ensued shortly thereafter in 2015. And most recently, the Indiana federal \ncourt has incorporated the inclusion of sexual-orientation as sex-discrimination in the Hively \nv Tech Cmty, Coll. Of Ind., 2017. \nObergefell v. Hodges, 576 US. On April 28, 2015, Oral Arguments were made before \nthe US Supreme Court, stating that “the intimate and committed relationships of same sex \ncouples, just like those of heterosexual couples, provide mutual support and are the \nfoundation of family life in our society,” (Bonauto, 2015, p. 5) petitioning for the legalization \nof same-sex marriage at the federal level in the US. Bonauto goes on to say that “Here we \nhave a whole class of people who are denied the equal right to be able to join in this very \nextensive government institution that provides protection for families” (p. 5). On June 26, \n2015, the US Supreme Court rested those opinions in favor of “same-sex marriage.”  Justice \nKennedy presented the official Opinion of the Court statement, declaring: “The Fourteenth \nAmendment requires a State to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to \n\t\t\n20 \nrecognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully \nlicensed and performed out-of-State” (Supreme Court Transcript for case 14-556, p. 1). \nJustice Kennedy presented support for this decision based on previous court cases pertaining \nto laws criminalizing same-sex intimacy, stating that: \nAlthough Bowers was eventually repudiated in Lawrence, men and woman were \nharmed in the interim and the substantial effects of these injuries no doubt lingered \nlong after Bowers was overruled. Dignitary wounds cannot always be healed with the \nstroke of a pen.  Ruling against same-sex couples would have the same effect—and, \nlike Bowers, would be unjustified under the Fourteen Amendment. (Supreme Court \nTranscript for case 14-556, p. 25) \n \nClosing the official statement of the court, Kennedy proclaims that same-sex marriage \nis not a disrespect for the institution of marriage, but quite the opposite: “Their plea is that \nthey do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. \nTheir hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s \noldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The constitution grants \nthem that right” (p. 28). Yet, while the Official Opinion of the Court was in favor of the \nconstitutionality of same-sex marriage, the ruling alone does not reflect the contested \ndiscourses that remain. This is evident when examining other Supreme Court cases arguing \nfor equal protection under the law. In comparison to most other Supreme Court cases arguing \n14th Amendment Rights, the ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges was a split vote 5-4, with Justice \nKennedy carrying the “swing vote.” This split indicates the continued presence of contested \ndiscourses and heteronormative ideologies. That is, ideological assumptions about gender \nidentity and sexual orientation continue to exist within a contested space defined by the \narguments, debates, and resistance movements both for and against legislation extending \nequal protection under the law to LGBT-identified individuals—including marriage. This is \n\t\t\n21 \nevident in a statement made by the Mormon Church on June 29, 2015 following the Supreme \nCourt ruling in the Obergefell v. Hodges case: \nBecause of the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court and similar legal \nproceedings and legislative actions in a number of countries that have given civil \nrecognition to same-sex marriage relationships, the Council of the First Presidency \nand the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \nSaints restates and reaffirms the doctrinal foundation of Church teachings on \nmorality, marriage, and the family. (Mormons.org) \n \nHere again, the Mormon Church felt the need to reassert their religious tenets \nopposing same-sex marriage—demonstrative of the power of the Mormon Church to speak \non behalf of PoF. To contextualize the way in which the Mormon Church is attempting to \nposition itself and other PoF as equally discriminated against, I review the history and origins \nof the Mormon Church. Additionally, I review the major doctrinal tenets and church policies \nto contextualize Mormonism’s reinforcement of heteronormative ideologies. \nCurrent Proposed Anti-gay Legislation \n While there has been a clear trend in the advancement of gay rights in state and \nfederal laws protecting LGBTQ citizens from discrimination based on sexual-orientation, \ncurrent proposed legislation tells a very different story. Several state and federal court cases \nare underway that argue for practice of religious freedoms as a justification for refusal to \nprovide services to LGBTQ citizens, refusal to acknowledge same-sex marriage, and even \nfanatic and extremist calls to recriminalize homosexuality. I provide a brief overview of a \nfew of these cases to demonstrate the exigence of addressing the rhetorical strategies of \nreligious organizations (like the Mormon Church) to influence the passing of these laws into \npractice. \n\t\t\n22 \nReligious Freedom Reformation Acts (RFRAs). The original Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act was signed into law in 1993 with sweeping support by both the House and \nthe Senate to “ensure that interests in religious freedom are protected” (supremecourt.gov). \nLater, the City of Boerne v Flores Supreme Court case in 1997 found that the law did not \naccount for the Anti-Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and was therefore \nunconstitutional. In response to the case’s outcome, 21 individual states passed state-RFRAs. \nMost notably, following the landmark decision in the Burwell v Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. \nSupreme Court case recognizing state-RFRAs as grounds for acknowledging a for-profit \ncorporation’s claims to religious freedoms, now Vice President Mike Pence (then governor \nof Indiana) passed Indiana Senate Bill 101 (RFRA), which allows individuals and companies \nto claim that their free exercise of religions has been unduly burdened by federal or state law \n(i.e., extending religious freedoms to the organizations and companies owned by religiously-\nidentified individuals). While not explicitly stated, those opposing the law drew attention to \nthe inherently homophobic nature of the law through protests and boycotts. In response, \nPence singed a “clarifying measure” intended to debunk the idea that his RFRA was targeting \nthe LGTBQ community stating that: \nThe RFRA does not authorize a provider — including businesses or individuals — \nto refuse to offer or provide services, facilities, goods, employment, housing or \npublic accommodation to any member of the public based on sexual orientation or \ngender identity, in addition to race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, \ndisability, sex or military service.  \nYet, the new languaging still provided ways for churches and religious organizations to be \nexempt from the definition of a “provider.” Criticism of this bill demonstrates the possibility \nof these RFRAs being a driving force for fighting back against the proliferation of pro-\n\t\t\n23 \nLGBTQ legislation. And these speculations have been substantiated in cases like \nMasterpiece Cakeshop v Colorado Civil Rights Commission. \nMasterpiece Cakeshop v Colorado Civil Rights Commission Supreme Court Case. \nOn December 5, 2017, the Supreme Court of the US heard Oral Arguments in a Masterpiece \nCakeshop v Colorado Civil Rights Commission Supreme Court case. The case began when a \nbaker in Colorado refused to make a wedding case for gay couple Charlie Craig and David \nMullins arguing that he “should not be compelled to violate his religious beliefs by creating a \ncustom dessert for the couple” (denverpost.com). Phillips argues that a “custom” cake is a \nform of artistic expression that constitutes speech, and therefore ought to be protected \naccordingly. Much of the conversation within the Oral Arguments of this case highlight the \npotential of RFRAs to allow individuals and businesses claiming religious freedoms to \ndiscriminate against LGBTQ individuals. Justice Kagen highlights three axes that speak to \nthis potential discrimination. First, where do we draw the line on what constitutes freedom of \nexpression? For example, the court cites instances of the hairdresser, the invitations, and the \nflorist. Second, he asks the question “why is this just about gay people?” (i.e., what prevents \nthis from becoming a gateway into discriminating against other protected groups?) And third, \nhe asks the question “Why is it only weddings?” and goes on to provide the example of a \nsame-sex couple going into a restaurant and ordering an anniversary meal. Can the chef \nclaim freedom of expression in meal preparation any more than a baker can make claims to \nbeing a cake artist? The court has not yet ruled on this case. \nOther Legislation Affecting LGBTQ Rights in the US. The American Civil \nLiberties Union (ACLU) reports that in 2017 alone, 27 Comprehensive Affirmative \n\t\t\n24 \nNondiscrimination Bills10 in 19 different states were proposed—all but three dying at the \ncommittee level. An additional 32 Incomplete Protection Affirmative Nondiscrimination \nBills11 were proposed in 13 states—all of which died at the committee level. In tandem with \nthese bills, Religious Exemption Bills12 have been proposed in 2017. There were five RFRA \nbills proposed in five states, an additional eight First Amendment Defense Acts (FADAs) \nproposed, and an additional twelve proposed bills related to marriage (namely same-sex \nmarriage) all pertaining to the exemption of religious organizations sustaining anti-\ndiscrimination laws pertaining to LGBTQ rights.  Statistics have yet to be populated for \n2018. \n \nMormon Church Origins, History, and Major Doctrinal Tenets \nThis section covers the history of the Mormon Church, including the Church’s origins \nas well as its history of being oppressed by other Christians in the US. I outline its history of \noppression to contextualize the Mormon Church’s claims to discrimination based on religion. \nThis contextualization is important, because the discourse under examination attempts to \nposition PoF as equally discriminated against as the LGBT community. The fact that the \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n10 Comprehensive nondiscrimination bills prohibit discrimination based on both sexual \norientation and gender identity (or only gender identity if state law already covers sexual \norientation), in a range of contexts, including employment, housing, and public \naccommodations.  Comprehensive bills do not have overly broad religious exemptions or \nother carve-outs that allow discrimination against LGBT people. (aclu.org). \n \n11 Incomplete nondiscrimination bills include those that lack gender identity protections, \nthose that do not prevent discrimination in all key contexts, and those that contain broad \nreligious exemptions language or carve-outs, including for sex-segregated facilities. \n \n12 These make it easier for people to demand exemptions to generally applicable laws by \nallowing lawsuits challenging any governmental policy (such as nondiscrimination laws) that \nsomeone says substantially burdens her/his religious beliefs. The government must prove that \nenforcing the policy is the least restrictive way of furthering a compelling governmental \ninterest. \n\t\t\n25 \nMormon Church experienced discrimination during its formative years illuminates the \nrationale for this positioning. \nMormon Church Origins. Joseph Smith Jr. is attributed as the founder of the \nMormon Church. Smith was a sixth-generation American living in Palmyra, New York when \nthe church was established in 1830. Books written about Mormon heritage suggest that Smith \nstruggled spiritually throughout his youth during a time of religious proliferation in the US. \nAt the age of 14, Smith investigated many of the available religious denominations but was \nunsatisfied with his inability to determine which church he should join. Smith claims to have \nprayed to God for the answer and experienced what is known as “The First Vision” in \nMormon vernacular (Teachings, p. 5). While praying, Smith states that he had a vision in \nwhich God-the-Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him telling him not to join any church \nbecause none of them were true. Rather, he had been chosen by God to be the new prophet—\nthe same as the prophets of the Old Testament—to “restore” Christ’s true gospel, which had \nbeen removed from earth at the time of Christ’s crucifixion (Preach My Gospel, 2004). \nChurch records report that Smith was later baptized and confirmed as the prophet of the \nchurch by John the Baptist who appeared to him in a resurrected form. This was one of many \nvisions Smith reports during the 10-year period between “The First Vision” and the official \nestablishment of the Mormon Church on April 6, 1830. \nDuring the period of time between “The First Vision,” and the official establishment \nof the church, by Smith’s personal records, he states that he was instructed by an angel to \nunearth a set of golden plates—a record of a civilization of people who sailed to the \nAmericas from Jerusalem by God’s command to avoid the destruction at the time of the \nTower of Babel (History, p. xx). Smith purports to have spent several years translating the \n\t\t\n26 \nmessage engraved upon the plates into English, which he titled The Book of Mormon: \nAnother Testament of Jesus Christ. At the inception of the church, 6 members were baptized, \nand within 2 years, the church had hundreds of followers (Church Statistical Reports). \nMissionary work was (and continues to be) a central part of Mormonism, and the church’s \nproselytizing efforts began drawing attention, particularly because they presented The Book \nof Mormon as sacred scripture that was “more correct than the bible” (Smith, p. xx). This \ndeclaration and many of the other doctrinal tenets regarding Smith’s accounts of visions and \nspeaking with God were interpreted as blasphemous by other Christian denominations. \n“Persecution of the saints.” The interpretation of Mormon doctrines as blasphemous \nled to members of the Mormon Church experiencing discrimination by way of violence, \nphysical expulsion, imprisonment, and murder. According to records kept by members of the \nChurch in the mid 1800s, the violence committed against members of the Mormon Church \nincluded instances of “tar and feathering,” men being pulled from their homes at night and \nbeaten, as well as the “Mountains Meadow Massacre” in 1857, with an estimated 100-140 \ncasualties. Church founder Joseph Smith Jr. (as well as many other members of the church) \nwere repeatedly imprisoned on charges of treason. In 1836, Smith was imprisoned upon \nwhich a vigilante group of men broke into the jail and shot and killed Smith. Two years later, \nan extermination order was issued in 1838 that dictated that any Mormon in the state of \nMissouri was to be shot on site, leading to the first of many expulsions for members of the \nMormon Church, which would eventually lead to the fleeing of Mormon members \n“westward,” where they eventually established a settlement in Salt Lake City. Due to this \nexpulsion, over 70,000 members of the Mormon Church traveled nearly 1,300 miles from \nNavoo, Illinois to Salt Lake City, Utah between 1846-1847 in covered wagons. This mass \n\t\t\n27 \nexodus began in January and February of 1846 and thus travelers were subjected to \nstarvation, disease, and intolerable climate conditions, resulting in an estimated 600 deaths \nbefore reaching Salt Lake City. Many have argued that it was the loss of so many men (due \nto cultural chivalry) that led to the institutionalizion of polygamy because there were so many \nwomen and children without means of income or head-of-household support. As outlined \nearly in this introduction, polygamy was a doctrinal tenet the Mormon Church was “forced” \nto abandon in order to claim statehood in Utah. \nI review these instances to contextualize the Mormon Church’s perceived \nsubjectivities contributing to its underlying motivations of its claims to present-day \ndiscrimination. That is, these experiences of church members in the mid-1800s led to the \nadoption of church doctrines regarding the place and purpose of discrimination within the \nchurch. That is, Mormons perceive themselves as an eternal target of discrimination, and that \nthis is God’s intention. This perspective is predicated upon Mormon doctrine regarding “the \ngreat and abominable church,” a conceptualization of all the forces of evil banding together \nto attempt to destroy God’s true church (Robinson, 1988). Books documenting the \n“persecution of the saints,” in Mormon vernacular, have been used to reify the notion that \nMormons will always be persecuted because they belong to the “one true church.” Thus, \nthese historical accounts of violence and discrimination enacted on members of the Mormon \nChurch in the mid-1800s are accounted for to substantiate these claims. \nMormon Doctrine and Church Policies \nLastly, I address the doctrinal tenets pertinent to this particular project—namely \ndoctrines substantiating heteronormativity. One of the most foundational doctrines of the \nMormon Church is called “The Plan of Salvation.” The plan states that all living beings were \n\t\t\n28 \ncreated spiritually (in a pre-mortal life) before they were born on Earth. It includes the belief \nthat all humans required obtaining a body in order to progress toward salvation. Grounded \nwithin this belief is the assumption that having children is essential to “God’s plan,” and \ntherefore, homosexuality runs counter to this endeavor. \n The plan of salvation. One of Mormonism’s core doctrines outlines a plan that God \ncreated to save, redeem, and exalt mortal beings called “The Plan of Salvation.” The plan \nconsists of four major transitional states all beings must progress through in order to achieve \nsalvation and eternal life: Pre-mortal existence, Earthly mortality, the Spirit World, and the \nKingdoms of Glory. The pre-mortal existence is conceptualized as the place where God \ncreated his children spiritually, and they lived with him before the creation of earth. Mortality \nis viewed as a period of trial where all spirits are subjected to both death and sin (defined as \nany deviation from God’s will). After mortal death, the spirit then resides in the Spirit World, \na temporary realm for the dead to continue to prepare for judgment day and the second \ncoming of Jesus Christ. Based upon both faith and works, spirits will then receive a perfect, \nimmortal body and reside in one of three Kingdoms of Glory: Tellestial, Terrestrial, and \nCelestial. The Celestial Kingdom is noted as the most supreme, where humans can become as \nGod is now—creating their own worlds and own spirit children. The details of this particular \ndoctrine are important insofar as progression through the different states of being is \npredicated upon heteronormative myths that reinforce the conceptualization of heterosexual \nintercourse as necessary to bring God’s children from the spirit world into mortal existence. \n Additionally, central to the ideological assumptions of “The Plan of Salvation,” is the \nnotion of agency. Within this narrative, during the pre-existence, God asked all of His \nchildren to propose a plan to save all humankind. In the narrative, Satan proposes the first \n\t\t\n29 \nplan in which he guarantees full retention of all souls to God by forcing everyone to do what \nis correct, and therefore losing no souls to sin. In contrast, Christ steps forward and suggests \nthat agency is essential to the process of salvation and that people must be given agency to \nsin, and consequently offers to pay for the sins of all humankind as the means by which \npeople could return to God and live in his presence. I provide this overview, because it \napplies to the (lie)alectics discussed during the analysis of this research. The Plan of \nSalvation is predicated upon heteronormative ideologies, and the assumptions made within \nthe Plan of Salvation directly relate to the church’s framing of agency in what aspects of \nidentity are chosen, and which identities are permanent, unchanging, and unchosen. \nProphetic authority and priesthood. Mormonism’s stance on same-sex attraction \nbecomes increasingly important when considering Mormonism’s claim to absolute authority \nto speak God’s will to “all mankind.” The doctrinal canons of the Mormon Church function \nin accordance with the conceptualization of time as dispensations.  It is important to \nunderstand Mormonism’s treatment of dispensations in order to understand the church’s \nclaim to God’s authority. While the term dispensation is used within many different contexts, \ntheologically a dispensation is defined as “one of the several systems or bodies of law in \nwhich at different periods God has revealed his mind and will to man, such as the Patriarchal \nDispensation, the Mosaic Dispensation, or the Christian Dispensation” (Smith, 1976, XXIII). \nThe Mormon Church treats dispensations as a “map of God’s authority on Earth since the \nbeginning of time” (Roberts, 2011, p. 10).  \nAccording to Mormonism, during each dispensation, God has (and continues) to call \nprophets and grants them the power and authority to act in his name and direct his people. \nThe Mormon Church accepts the Old Testament as doctrine “as far as it is translated \n\t\t\n30 \ncorrectly” (Articles of Faith, 1981). Thus, the prophets of the Old Testament leading up to \nthe birth of Christ are treated as having the authority to act in God’s name. When born, Christ \nbecame the “prophet,” the ultimate authority of God on Earth. Christ called 12 apostles and \ngranted them his power and authority to also act in the name of God.  Mormonism’s claim to \nauthentic divining of authority stems from the perspective that: “after the crucifixion of \nChrist and the death of the last apostle, the authority of God left the Earth until it was \nrestored by Joseph Smith, Jr. in 1830” (Roberts, 2011, p. 10). Elder Russel M. Ballard \n(1993), one of the modernly-called twelve apostles, discusses this doctrinal tenet: \nWhile there continued to be Christians who believed basically in the message \nof Jesus Christ, over time the doctrines became distorted and the authority to \nact in the name of God—in other words, the priesthood—disappeared.  After a \nperiod of years, the Apostles died who had received their priesthood, their \nspiritual assignment, and their ordination in the time of Christ.  They took \ntheir priesthood authority with them.  In short, the church Christ organized \ngradually disintegrated, and the fullness of the gospel was lost.  (p. 28) \n \nBecause Mormons believe God called Joseph Smith as a prophet—the same as other \nprophets were called upon to serve God in previous dispensations—the Mormon Church \nclaims the official power and authority to act in God’s name. Ballard (1993) proposes that: \n“authority is one of those concepts that most people seem to inherently understand—\nprobably because it governs almost every facet of our lives and has done so for as long as \nmost of us can remember” (Ballard, 1993, p. 51).  This concept of power and authority \nsystematically integrates into almost every system in our lives: education, government, \nfamilies, law enforcement, cultural norms, and religious institutions. Ballard (1993) \ncomments on the importance of this priesthood: \nIt includes God’s authority to perform all of the ordinances of the gospel of \nJesus Christ. It also gave Joseph all of the priesthood authority he would need \nto restore the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ on the earth. Thus Joseph \n\t\t\n31 \nSmith was authorized by God to organize His Church, The Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints. (p. 55) \n \n These records outline Mormonism’s unique claim to God’s authority to direct the \ntenets of the faith. This doctrine is significant for two reasons. First, it promotes and reifies \nthe Mormon Church’s felt necessity to proclaim their beliefs in the public forum in the form \nof press conferences and public statements. Additionally, Mormonism’s claim to direct \ncommunication with God allows Mormon church officials to receive new revelation from \nGod usurping previous doctrine and interpretation of scripture. The employment of this \ndoctrinal tenet is apparent in the church’s change to two significant policies and doctrines. \nThe first, as mentioned earlier in the introduction was the 1890 Manifesto changing church \npolicy on polygamy to align with US laws regarding marriage. The second is regarding the \nchurch’s change in policy regarding African American men’s right to hold “the \npriesthood”—the power to speak in God’s name. The original doctrine banning African \nAmerican men from holding the priesthood was predicated upon the belief that “blacks \ndescended from the same lineage as the biblical Cain, who slew his brother Abel…[and] \nGod’s ‘curse’ on Cain was the mark of a dark skin” (Doctrine & Covenants, p. 137). Because \nof this belief, in 1852 the then current president of the Mormon Church, Brigham Young \n“announced a policy restricting men of black African descent from priesthood ordination” \n(Church Records and Orders). However, as justice for black Americans progressed through \nthe Civil Rights Movement, in 1978, the then current prophet, Spencer W. Kimball purported \nto have prayed regarding changing the policy concerning priesthood restrictions to black \nmen, reporting: “By revelation [God] has confirmed that every…worthy man in the Church \nmay receive the holy priesthood…without regard for race or color” (Church Records and \nOrders). Thus, the Mormon Church has historically changed church policies to align with US \n\t\t\n32 \nlaw. Consequently, Mormonism’s rigid clinging to doctrine regarding same-sex practices is \nrhetorically significant. \n Mormonism’s evolving stance on homosexuality/same-sex attraction. The \nMormon Church holds a bi-annual conference (General Conference), at which time the \nprophet and apostles of the church speak and present new revelation to church members. \nReviewing the digital archive of these talks, a progression of Mormonism’s perspectives on \nhomosexuality emerges. The first mention of homosexuality occurred in the April 1971 \nGeneral Conference session. In his talk The Meaning of Morality, Elder Victor L. Brown \n(1971) refers to homosexuality as a tragic sin, caused by the confusion of gender and the \nadoption of gendered traits by members of the opposite sex (n.p.). This view of \nhomosexuality remains consistent in subsequent years, appearing in talks by President \nSpencer W. Kimball in 1974, 1976, and 1980, the last of which adds masturbation to the list \nof “causes” of homosexuality. Kimball’s (1976) contribution to the conversation about \nhomosexuality goes as far as to suggest homosexuality “still corrode[s] the mind, snuff[s] out \nself-esteem, and drag[s] one down into the darkness of anguish and unhappiness” (n.p.). \n The conversation about homosexuality remained similar through the 1980s and early \n1990s, while adding to the list of causes of homosexuality: “failure in the home” (Benson, \n1982, n.p.), “Disregarding principles and practices established by God” (Benson, 1982, n.p.), \nsexual sins that create “an unquenchable appetite that drives the offender to ever more \nserious sin” such as “acts of homosexuality” (Scott, 1994, n.p.). \n While Mormonism’s stance on homosexuality has remained one of objection, the \nlanguage used to talk about homosexuality changed in the mid-1990s. After 1994, none of \nthe General Conference talks contain the word “homosexuality” or “homosexual.” These \n\t\t\n33 \nterms were replaced with the phrases “same-gender attraction” or “same-sex attraction.”  \nAdditionally, while still considering homosexuality a sin, the focus of the discourse shifted \naway from condemnation to one of pity. President Gordon B. Hinckley’s 1995 conference \ntalk Stand Strong Against the Wiles of the World highlights this shift: \nThere are those who would have us believe in the validity of what they choose to call \nsame-sex marriage. Our hearts reach out to those who struggle with feelings of \naffinity for the same gender. We remember you before the Lord, we sympathize with \nyou, we regard you as our brothers and our sisters. However, we cannot condone \nimmoral practices on your part any more than we can condone immoral practices on \nthe part of others. (n.p.) \n \n Even more recently, the doctrine treats homosexuality as more commonplace, \ncomparing it to the ranks of other “heavy burdens,” as outlined in Elder Dallin H. Oaks’ \n(2006) conference talk He Heals the Heavy Laden:  \nMany carry heavy burdens. Some have lost a loved one to death or care for one who \nis disabled. Some have been wounded by divorce. Others yearn for eternal marriage. \nSome are caught in the grip of addictive substances or practices like alcohol, tobacco, \ndrugs, or pornography. Others have crippling physical or mental impairments. Some \nare challenged by same-gender attraction. Some have terrible feelings of depression \nor inadequacy. In one way or another, many are heavy laden. (n.p.) \n \n Here, Oaks equates “same-gender attraction” as equivalent to the burden of death and \nloss, substance abuse, and physical and mental impairments—a view of homosexuality as \nsomething to be endured, overcome, abandoned, and/or conquered. In this way, the church \ndid not “change” its stance on homosexuality; it still treats it as offensive to God, sinful, and \ngrounds for excommunication. However, the change in conversation reflects a social \nawareness of the changing ideological assumptions about homosexuality outside of the \nchurch, which promote tolerance, and compassion. In this way, Mormonism’s stance on \nhomosexuality is adaptive.  \n\t\t\n34 \nFurthermore, in December 2012, the Mormon Church launched its first version of the \nMormon and Gay website entitled Mormons and Gays (note plurality). The church put out a \nnews release in October 2016 announcing their revamping of their website stating that, “The \nnew appellation, ‘Mormon and Gay,’ reflects the reality that a person doesn’t need to choose \nbetween the two identities – one can, in fact, be gay and live faithful to the teachings of \nChrist” (Newsroom, Church Updates, 2016, n.p.). While to some degree or another, this has \nbeen the church’s general approach since the early 1990s, the clarity of this stance has not \nalways been so straight forward. The previous version of the website (which is now \ninaccessible) had a similar format, providing several statements from high-ranking Mormon \nofficials about the church’s stance on same-sex attraction, and mainly focused on the stories \nof a few individuals’ testimonials of overcoming their same-sex attraction impulses while \nstaying faithful to the church. \nOne of the leading faces on the original Mormon and Gay website, Ty Mansfield, told \nhis story of being willing to live a celibate life, and recounts his experiences of feeling \nblessed when he fell in love with his wife. Nearly ten years prior to the publication of the \nMormons and Gays website, Mansfield published a book entitled In Quiet Desperation: \nUnderstanding the Challenge of Same-Gender Attraction, in which he openly discusses his \nexperiences “struggling” with same-gender13 attraction, his nights of pleading for God to take \nit away, and his ultimate peace with choosing obedience over lust—not unlike my own \nexperience grappling with negotiating my religion and sexuality. In this book, Mansfield \n(2004) makes a statement that, true to my own experience, aptly depicts Mormon \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n13 In the original Mormons and Gays website, same-sex attraction and same-gender attraction \nwere used interchangeably. The term same-gender attraction is no longer used on the \nMormon and Gay website since its update in 2016. \n\t\t\n35 \nperspectives on same-sex attraction in the early 2000’s based on his apprehension in writing \nthe book. He states: \nOnce I made the decision to attempt to translate my convictions and passions onto \npaper, I was confronted with the difficult decision of whether or not I would attach \nmy real name to the book. With a topic so widely misunderstood—and one in which \nthere is such passionate controversy and divergence of belief—I was initially \nextremely hesitant….I had to consider the implications putting my name on the work \nwould have. In addition to my own concerns, it seemed like everyone around me had \na few of their own to throw into the already scorching internal fire. (Mansfield, 2004, \np. 243-244) \n \n Furthermore, he goes on to give his own opinion regarding the appropriateness of \ndisclosing issues of sexuality, something to which I personally received counter advice on \nfrom different spiritual leaders throughout my journey in attempting to change my sexuality. \nThis statement reflects one of the first movements toward the church’s current position on \nsame-sex attraction, as few other books had been written about homosexuality by Mormon \nauthors: \nI do not believe it appropriate for those of us who have feelings of same-gender \nattraction to casually announce our challenge from the pulpit or to share it with \nanyone other than those who have stewardship over us or with whom we feel the \nLord has guided us to share it. But I do believe that unless we who experience this \nchallenge—and who desire to live faithful to God and refuse to suppress our feelings \nin quiet desperation—are willing to discuss our feelings with those who love us and \nwho can bless and help and strengthen and support us, the misperceptions of society \nand those closest to us will never change. (Mansfield, 2004, p. 245) \n \n While not formal doctrine on behalf of the Mormon Church, Mansfield’s sentiment \nreflects my own experience of being a closeted lesbian in 2004. In fact, I remember when the \nbook was first published, and I stole a copy from the Mormon bookstore I was working at \nand returned it days later, because I knew that were I to attempt to purchase the book, I \nwould be calling my own sexuality into question. But perhaps more importantly is the way in \n\t\t\n36 \nwhich Mormon discourse surrounding issues of homosexuality and same-sex attraction has \nchanged over the past decade. The doctrine itself (theoretically) has not changed; I was told \nrepeatedly by spiritual leaders that my feelings of attraction to women did not constitute \ngrounds for excommunication, only if I were ever to act upon them. But what has changed is \nthe discourse. The mere presence of the website itself is evidence of this shift, as no such \nresources were available to members of the Mormon Church prior to publication of the \noriginal Mormons and Gays website in 2012. Additionally, the website speaks to the \nperspective that the church believes that, “The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is \nand should be involved with the question of homosexual conduct” (Byrd, 2001, viii). At that \ntime, the only books written about homosexuality regarding the Mormon Church were aimed \nat asserting Mormonism’s stance on homosexuality and society’s assault on their position: \nThe Church of Jesus Christ does not condemn those who struggle with homosexual \nattraction; it does condemn homosexual behavior…This policy of “hate the sin; love \nthe sinner” is challenged by a population of people who have declared that their \nsexual preference is as natural to them as their brown hair, blue eyes, or short toes. In \na way that is uncommon among other individuals who choose not to abide by Church \nteachings, those who commit homosexual acts have banded together in colleges, \nlobbies, and neighborhoods to gain support on various campuses, in legislatures, and \nin communities. As a result of a political agenda, some people across America and the \nworld have accepted the homosexual lifestyle as a normal lifestyle. In stark contrast, \nthe Church rejects all homosexual behavior in spite of political movements that \nadvocate total acceptance…Thus the “gay” movement compares itself to the Civil \nRights movement of the Sixties and has become one of the most divisive issues in \nrecent political history. This movement sees the Church as not merely opposing a \nkind of behavior but opposing an entire developing culture; and by extension, \ndiscriminating against a segment of the population. (Byrd, 2001, p. 4-5) \n \n This quotation clearly shows that the Mormon Church has viewed the Gay Rights \nMovement as assaultive since the early 2000s (if not earlier) and demonstrates that the \nofficial position of the church has been the same for decades (i.e., the attraction is not a sin, \nbut acting on it is). Yet, as the analysis of this research will show, the discourse itself (the \n\t\t\n37 \napproach, the language, and the structure of the text) has changed to appear more accepting \nof gay identities and individuals without actually changing its homophobic doctrine. \nSimilarly, while I am unable to access the original website, my initial reading of the \nMormons and Gays website in 2013 was that it was a PR stunt to counter negative publicity \nthe Mormon Church had received beginning in 2008 in the backlash of their support of the \nProposition 8 campaign. The new Mormon and Gay website is now advertised as “ministerial \nmaterials for members” (Newsroom, Church Updates, 2016, n.p.), yet still functions as \ndiscourse representing the Mormon Church as more accepting of homosexuality, same-sex \nattraction, and sexual identities, again, without actually changing its homophobic doctrine. \nThus, this shift in the discourse itself is rhetorically significant and warrants examination. As \nsuch, below I provide a brief overview of the current version of the Mormon and Gay \nwebsite to provide the context from which the analysis of this discourse emerges. \nThe Website: Mormon and Gay \n In this section, I provide an overview of each of the pages published on the Mormon \nand Gay website to provide context for the examples utilized in the analysis chapter. This is \norganized according to the three sections on the website: Stories, Beliefs, and \nUnderstandings. It provides an overview of the point and purpose of each section, and \nprovides a brief synopsis of the content of each page published on the website to provide the \nbackground of the information being analyzed in this analysis. \nStories \nThe Mormon and Gay website offers a collection of six stories from members of the \nMormon Church who either experience same-sex attraction themselves or are parents of gay \nchildren. These stories are first-person narratives of individuals who either experience same-\n\t\t\n38 \nsex attraction or identify as gay or lesbian. They are the stories of how these individuals \nnegotiate their sexual experiences and/or identities while maintaining active participation in \nthe Mormon Church (i.e., serving missions, attending church meetings, performing temple \nrituals, and engaging other church services). They outline the emotional journeys of these \nindividuals, with common narratives of guilt and shame as well as the way they negotiate \ntheir agency between attraction and action (i.e., negotiating whether or not to participate in \nsame-sex sexual experiences). \n Becky’s story. Becky tells the story of her experience when her son Xian came out to \nher as gay. She discusses her inner struggle with the dissonance between loving her son and \nher beliefs stemming from her religious faith as a member of the Mormon Church. She \nexamines her experience of confusing “loving” with “condoning,” the feelings of guilt she \nhad, and how she was finally able to learn to love her son unconditionally—regardless of his \nsexual orientation.  \nJessyca’s story. Jessyca tells her story of accepting her gay identity while \nmaintaining membership in the Mormon Church. She recounts being attracted to other \nwomen, and she discusses her contention with her belief that same-sex attraction was a \nchoice and knowing that she did not choose the feelings she was having. Even though she \nhad never acted (i.e., engaged sexual behaviors) with other women, she felt high levels of \nguilt and shame, which led her to seek help from church leaders and a psychologist as she \nattempted to navigate the depression that ensued when she accepted celibacy as her reality. \nShe finishes her story by relishing the love and support she has received from family and \nchurch leaders as she embraces her identity as a gay Mormon, a maneuver possible through \nthe action of celibacy. \n\t\t\n39 \nJosh’s story. Josh tells his story of being a gay Mormon. He recalls feeling wounded \nby family and friends unintentionally, which hindered his ability to give and receive love. He \ndiscusses his process of coming out as a journey toward love, obedience, and God’s will and \naway from loneliness, despair, and a sense of doom. He discusses the suicide of his mother \nand how that was the catalyst for beginning to “explore [his] homosexuality by dating men.” \nHe recounts his experience of both rejection and acceptance and considers that the \ncornerstone of his decision to remain active in the church—choosing a celibate life over the \nlove he felt for the men he had been dating. \nLaurie’s story. Laurie discusses her story of leaving the Mormon Church and \nparticipating in relationships with other women and eventually returning to the church to \nmarry a man who was “not only okay with [her] past, he was deeply moved by it.” She states \nthat she “has always known the gospel to be true,” but that guilt and shame over her feelings \nof same-sex attraction at a time when “gays and lesbians were called hurtful and degrading \nnames” and when “few people came out of the closet because it hurt too much,” had driven \nher to stop attending church and she began drinking and using drugs. She recounts feeling \nguilty at church during lessons on chastity because she had been molested by an older cousin \nand raped by a family friend when she was 10-yrs-old and believed that (consensual or not), \nshe had “committed ‘the worst sin next to murder’” as outlined by Mormon doctrine. Laurie \ntells how she felt an impression that she needed to return to church. She met with church \nleaders and repented of her sexual sins. She considered her sexual attractions as a matter of \nagency, and that while she assumed it would be difficult, she would choose to “remain \ncelibate for the rest of [her] life.”  \n\t\t\n40 \nRicardo’s story. Ricardo was born and raised in Mexico City. He tells his story as a \njourney that began when he was 4-yrs-old, when two men living with his family sexually \nabused him, prompting feelings of confusion about the sense of excitement he was feeling. \nHe views this as “something that altered my soul and affected how I connected with and \nperceived men throughout my life.” He states that he’s “not sure if this even was the root of \n[his] physical attraction to men, but it contributed to feelings and habits that haunted [him] \nfor  years afterwards.” He states that he finds solace in the realization that his “SSA does not \ndefine [him] as a person or a son of God.” \nTonya’s tory. Tonya tells her story of her son Andy coming out to her as gay. She \nexplains that, even from the time he was an infant, she felt strong impressions that he was \ngay, but she ignored these impressions. She describes her experience as being clumsy and \ninsensitive responding to her son’s disclosure, but that her love for her son never wavered. \nShe discusses how she spent countless hours fasting, praying, and attending temple services \nto try and gain insight to why this was happening to her and her family, fueled by a pride-\nbased grief of not being able to produce the perfect Mormon family, and eventually settling \ninto an ability to live with a spiritual ambiguity about her son’s sexuality. \nBeliefs  \nTurning now to the second cluster of articles published under the title of Beliefs, these \narticles are centered around messages outlining Mormon doctrine regarding same-sex \nattraction, marriage, and sexual appetites. They reiterate basic Mormon beliefs regarding the \nposition of home and family and the centrality of marriage to “The Plan of Salvation”—a \ncore Mormon doctrine that outlines the journey of the soul into and out of mortality. These \nalso establish the point and purpose of the Mormon and Gay website. \n\t\t\n41 \n Church teachings. This article is largely focused around the Mormon Church’s \nbelief that God’s love is paramount and transcends all facets of identity—race, gender, \nsexuality, socioeconomics, etc. It also focuses on the atonement of Jesus Christ as the \npinnacle testimony of this transcendent love, and the central role of “keeping the \ncommandments” as the means of maintaining worthiness of Christ’s atonement. That is, \nGod’s love is limitless; however, Christ’s atonement is limited based on the faithfulness of \nthose who follow the doctrines of the church. In fact, very little of this article actually says \nanything about same-sex attraction, homosexuality, or gender. Rather, the article is focused \non the fundamental centrality of God’s law and example—a perfect example and perfect \nlaw—with love being an innate characteristic of God. \nLove one another: A discussion on same-sex attraction. This article states the \npurpose of the Mormon and Gay website as well as provides the Church’s stance on their \nevolving approach to LGBT issues. It also addresses the way issues of same-sex attraction \naffect families within the Church and suggests that Mormons are at the forefront of \n“expressing love, compassion, and outreach.” Overall, this article sets up a model for Church \nmembers to “deal with” same-sex attraction when it presents itself in their lives. \nGod’s plan. This article articulates the Mormon Church’s understanding of the \npurpose of mortality—to gain a body and be tested (i.e., to experience temptation and resist \nit). By making choices that are in line with “God’s Plan,” people can achieve exaltation. \nThese choices include a multitude of decisions, including heterosexual marriage. While \npublished on the Mormon and Gay website, this article makes no direct mention of \nhomosexuality or same-sex attraction. Rather, it addresses sin in vague, overarching ways. \n\t\t\n42 \nChrist can change our hearts. This article is a recount of the Mormon Church’s \ndoctrine on the role of the Atonement of Jesus Christ as central to the process of salvation. It \ndescribes the human race as “fallen” and subject to opposition and temptation, and that when \npeople give into temptation, they alienate themselves from God. The article does not \nspecifically call homosexuality a sin, but alludes to it, as the majority of the article is spent \nrecounting the story of a young man struggling with same-sex attraction. It tells this narrative \nas a success story of this individual being able to change his heart and sexual orientation \nthrough the love and support of his family, friends, and church leaders, and through the \nAtonement of Jesus Christ. \nWho am I? This article is a conversation about identity labels. It states that how \npeople define themselves changes over time, and that the only truly stable identity is as a \n“beloved child of God.” All other identities are merely stages and not inherent characteristics \nof a person. The article instructs the reader to exercise caution in what labels they choose, \nbecause labels can affect the way other people treat them and may impede their ability to \nprogress eternally. It states that labels and identities are not thrust upon people, but rather, the \nonly “defining fact” is that “we are children of Heavenly Parents.” It closes by reiterating that \nit is not against church policy to choose an identity label, but that doing so may have \n“undesired consequences.” \nUnderstandings \nFinishing with the last cluster of articles published under the title of Understandings, \nthis collection provides a series of articles including topics such as Frequently Asked \nQuestions, Seeking Professional Help, Depression and Suicide, Self-Mastery and Sexual \nExpression, About Sexual Orientation, and Ten Tips for Parents. \n\t\t\n43 \nFrequently asked questions. In this article, the church poses seven questions \nregarding their policies on same-sex attraction. These questions cover such territory as why \nthey use the term “Same-Sex Attraction” instead of “Gay,” why the website doesn’t discuss \ngender dysphoria and transgender issues, whether or not feelings of same-sex attraction will \ngo away through faithfulness, and whether or not the church will ever change its policy \nregarding same-sex marriage. Overall, the article rearticulates many of the positions stated in \ndifferent articles on the website—that they will never change their stance on same-sex \nmarriage, that many people do experience a reduction in feelings of same-sex attraction when \nthey remain faithful to the church, and that labels are insignificant in relationship to the \neternal identity as a child of God. \nSeeking professional help. This article articulates the Mormon Church’s policy \nregarding the use of therapy in treating same-sex attraction. It states that “the Church \nrecommends approaches that respect client self-determination,” and that therapists (in or \noutside of the church) should respect client’s wishes regarding changing feelings of same-sex \nattraction. It states that counseling and therapy can be useful tools for some people, but they \nare not needed by all who experience same-sex attraction. The church does not take a stance \non whether or not members experiencing same-sex attraction should seek professional help.  \nSelf-mastery and sexual expression. This article is centered around the role of the \nbody in sexual expression and the role of marriage as the defining characteristic, which \ndifferentiates moral and immoral sexual encounters.  It references the body as the means of \nexperiencing the physical word, and that with that comes sexual passions, which need to be \n“bridled.” Following, the article states the Mormon Church’s policy on abstinence of sexual \nexpression “outside of lawful marriage.” It states that sexual expression is an important \n\t\t\n44 \naspect of bonding between spouses, but that outside of marriage it is sinful, degrading, and \nperverse. It further states that many individuals choose to bridle these passions and live a \nchaste life. \nDepression and suicide. This article is a brief overview of suicide prevention \nresources. It acknowledges that people experiencing same-sex attraction are at higher risk for \ndepression and suicide, and offers the article as a declaration of love to all people struggling \nwith suicidal ideation. It states that those living with same-sex attraction often experience \ngreat pain and sorrow, particularly if they have additional guilt for having acted in sinful \nways. The article ends by encouraging members to trust in God and utilize the gospel as a \nsource of healing. \nTen tips for parents. As is indicative by the title, this article is aimed at giving \nadvice to parents who have children experiencing same-sex attraction. These tips include: \nYou will never regret saying “I love you.” You have been entrusted with the care of a \nprecious soul; did you overreact, get angry, or say things you regret? Don’t be discouraged; if \nyou learn about your child’s same-sex attraction secondhand, don’t take it personally. It’s \nnatural to grieve; don’t blame yourself for your child’s same-sex attraction. As a parent, the \nleast productive prayer is “why?” The most helpful question you can ask is “how?” Surround \nyourself with people who build you up; and Peace and perspective go hand in hand. \nConclusion \n The evolving stance on homosexuality and LGBTQ rights in the US is important to \nunderstanding the larger implications of this research: religious discourses shaping public \npolicies that discriminate against and marginalize queer lives in the US. From criminalization \nto the legal entitlement to participate in the state-sanctioned institution of marriage, \n\t\t\n45 \nperspectives on homosexuality have shifted in the US, particularly during the last ten years. \nWith these changes, political pushback from the Christian Right seeks to take back its control \nover policing and punishing queer identities, behaviors, and performances. The history of the \nMormon Church provides the important facts that demonstrate that this discourse has deep \nroots in homophobia (as well as racist and sexist ideologies) and demonstrates the ways the \nMormon Church has historically responded to conflicts of interest between church doctrine \nand federal law. The evolution of the Mormons and Gays website into the Mormon and Gay \nwebsite brings attention to the importance of the shift in the discourse itself—not in church \npolicy, but the way the Mormon Church is talking about its policies and doctrines. In the next \nchapter, I provide an overview of relevant and current research regarding the theories and \nframeworks that inform this research. \n  \n\t\t\n46 \nCHAPTER 3 \nLITERATURE REVIEW \nIntroduction \n This study draws on theories, concepts, and assumptions surrounding issues of gender \nand sexuality including queer theory, intersectionality, and religious treatments. I review \nrelevant and current research pertaining to feminist studies, queer theory, religious studies \nand their applications both in and out of the communication discipline. This chapter provides \njustification for this research and situates it within current conversations about queerness, \nintersectional identities, and critical approaches to religious analyses. First, I situate my \nresearch within applications of queer theory, defining “queer” as it applies to this study, and \npoint out gaps in the treatment of queer theory and intersectionality and how this study \ncontributes to decreasing those gaps. Second, to substantiate this treatment of queer theory \nand intersectionality, as well as identify the gap in the treatment of critical examination of \nreligious discourses, I provide a theoretical review including: 1) literature outlining \nintersectionality in both feminist and queer applications, 2) literature outlining early queer \ntheory, critiques of queer theory and the contribution of queer of color critique, and 3) \nliterature on religious discourses and the ways in which a critical rhetorical approach can \nexpand this treatment. \nApplications of Queer Theory \n This study utilizes core concepts from queer theory and seeks to complicate and push \ncurrent queer theory applications, particularly queer theory’s utilization of intersectionality. \nIn line with Rand’s (2014) call to revisit early definitions of queer, this research aligns itself \n\t\t\n47 \nmost closely to Halperin’s (1995) definition of queer as “whatever is at odds with the normal, \nthe legitimate, the dominant. There is nothing in particular to which it necessarily refers. It is \nan identity without essence” (p. 61-62). Thus, within the context of this study, I use the word \nqueer/queerness/queering to refer to identities, places/spaces, as well as actions increasing \nvisibility of that which is at odds with dominant ideologies. Because the subject matter of this \nstudy is largely about sexuality, I confine the definition of queer/queerness/queering in \napplications of sexuality and gender—while still notating that queer has the potential for \nmuch broader applications. That is, this research acknowledges that within the \ncommunications discipline, most scholars narrowly apply queer theory to issues of gender \nand sexuality. While this research does deal with issues of gender and sexuality, I align with \nHalperin’s approach to the definition of queer insofar as it is a broad definition (i.e., queer \ndoes not have to be limited only to gender and sexuality), but for the purposes of this study, I \nfocus on queer as it pertains to gender and sexuality. \nFurthermore, in this research, I utilize queer not only as a theory but also a method. \nThat is, I utilize “queer” as a verb—the action of examining that which is at odds with the \nnormal (i.e., dominant ideologies). In this particular study, I focus on queering \nheteronormative spaces, specifically an institutionalized religion whose religious doctrine \nsubstantiates and reinforces heteronormative ideals through anti-gay and homophobic \nrhetoric. Thus, I align with Halperin’s (1995) approach to the definition of queer insofar as \nthis research seeks to disrupt the dominant discourse of heteronormativity as it applies to \nLGBTQ legislation in the US.  \nHowever, aligning with this definition is not without problems. One problem facing \nqueer theorists today is the constant paradox of the inability to define queerness. At its core, \n\t\t\n48 \nqueer studies resist stabilization; yet, it also acknowledges the necessity to utilize queerness \nas a facet of social change. Sullivan (2003) speaks to this problem acknowledging the \nlimiting effects that occurred when “‘queer’ was incorporated into the realm of academia and \nwas joined to the more ‘respectable’ word ‘theory’” (Kulick, 2005): \nWhile Queer Theory may now be recognized by many as an academic discipline, it \nnevertheless continues to struggle against the straightjacketing effects of \ninstitutionalization, to resist closure and remain in the process of ambiguous \n(un)becoming. Queer Theory does not want to ‘straighten up and fly right’ to have the \nkinks ironed out of it: it is a discipline that refuses to be disciplined, a discipline with a \ndifference, with a twist if you like. (Sullivan, 2003, p. x) \n  \n This statement highlights the tensions between “queer” as subject, and as Sullivan \n(2003) suggests, “it may be more productive to think of queer as a verb (a set of actions), \nrather than as a noun (and identity, or even nameable positionality formed in and through the \npractice of particular actions” (p. 50). Indeed, there is a growing tension between queer \npolitics and activism and the academy, insofar as the academy’s theorizing of queer theory \nhas arguably transformed “queer” into “an elitist enterprise led by a bunch of privileged \nacademics, who having gained rights thanks to identity politics, can now comfortably turn \ntheir backs on it and downplay or even deny the importance of sexual identities for people in \n‘real’ life” (Milani, 2013, p. 9). Milani goes on to suggest that: \nThe point that queer theorists want to make is that politics based on sexual identities \ncan, in the best of cases, lead only to a temporary re-calibration of power inequalities, \nbut will ultimately leave the homo/heterosexual binary intact and unchallenged (Yep \n2003: 47). In order to achieve the radical project of deep social transformation of the \nstatus quo, queer approaches promote a questioning of the seemingly “normal” and \nwidely accepted nature of the homo/heterosexual divide itself, therefore destabilizing \nthe very truth of that normality. (p. 9) \n \n This research grapples with this very problem: to what extent does queer theory \n\t\t\n49 \ninform what is happening in the discourse under examination and to what extent does it \n“limit” and “downplay” the lived experience of LGBTQ-identified individuals negotiating \neveryday politics? To what extent will this research contribute to theoretical applications of \nqueer theory and to what extent can it be utilized to mobilize social change? For example, \nsame-sex marriage simultaneously reifies the institutionalization of sexual identities, yet \nexclusion from this institution positions same-sex couples in ways that limit their navigation \nof everyday lived experiences (e.g., visiting a sick partner in the hospital, parental rights, and \nrights to citizenship). This research seeks to accomplish both: 1) to contribute to the \nconversation regarding the need to complicate, problematize, and challenge taken-for-granted \nnorms surrounding heteronormativity, and 2) to challenge and resist the discourses that seek \nto position LGBTQ-identified individuals in ways that would legalize institutionalized \ndiscrimination for those claiming rights to religious freedoms. \n This research is further complicated by the critiques of queer theory as an \n“exclusionary political movement characterized by a racialized (=white), gendered (=male), \nand social class (=middle-class) bias which ultimately police[s] and exclude[s] other forms of \nnon-heterosexual identifications” (Milani, 2013, p. 6). Intersectionality has been a useful tool \nin embracing this concern, emerging from women of color feminist studies to challenge the \nexclusion of those facing multiple sites of oppression. Additionally, it addresses some of the \nissues surrounding the inability to define ‘queerness’ insofar as it allows for a fluidity of \nidentity that can be conceptualized as both stable and changing. Yet, intersectionality is \nlimited in its ability to disrupt complex sites of oppression insofar as it restricts identity \nmarkers into categories (i.e., it is constrained by the very labels it seeks to disrupt). Warner \n(2004) identifies the skepticism surrounding identity categories as “these identity categories \n\t\t\n50 \nare all too real,” but “warns against a too optimistic reliance on sexual identities as the \ncatalyst for social change” (Milani, 2013, p. 7). \n For example, intersectionality has predominantly been used to signify “difference,” \nand most specifically “women of color” (Puar, 2011). This category has now become, Puar \n(2011) argues, “simultaneously emptied of specific meaning on the one hand and \noverdetermined in its deployment on the other” (n.p.). In this way, “intersectionality always \nproduces an Other” (Puar, 2011, n.p.), arguably because of the overemphasis on the body as \nthe site of oppression. By contrast, Massumi (2002) talks about “event-potential” drawing \nfocus away from the “crime taking place” or focusing on who is at fault, but rather asks the \nquestion “what are the affective conditions necessary for the event-space to unfold?” (Puar, \n2011, n.p.). \n This research seeks to expand upon this idea by complicating the hierarchy of \npositioning of identities (i.e., to draw attention away from the individual actors and focus on \nthe external factors that push and pull upon bodies to be positioned in specific ways). For \nexample, the passing of same-sex marriage in the US is an external force prompting \ndiscourse and as an intersectional event not unlike the conceptualization of the rhetorical \nsituation (Bitzer, 1968). That is, the matter of exigence stands to expand intersectionality’s \ntreatment of how people are positioned in oppressive ways. Crenshaw’s use of the traffic \nmetaphor focuses on the actors and events (i.e., the cars involved and the accident itself). \nWhat it does not account for is how or why the cars are driving through the intersection in the \nfirst place. The driving exigence, “a form of social knowledge—a mutual construction of \nobjects, events, interest, and purposes—an objectified social need” (Bitzer, 1968) is created \nbefore the impact. It is what bring bodies together and creates the “event-space” for bodies to \n\t\t\n51 \ncollide, crash, and reconstruct. This project utilizes notions of intersectionality to focus on \nthe how and why components of the emerging discourse. \nIntersectionality \n Because this project utilizes notions of intersectionality, and particularly because the \nanalysis of this research deals heavily with identities and how those identities are being \npositioned to obfuscate homophobia and reinforce heteronormativity, I offer the following \nreview of intersectionality regarding both feminist and queer applications of intersectionality \nto substantiate its appropriateness for this research. \nFeminist Approaches to Intersectionality  \nThe theoretical framework of intersectionality emerged in the 1980s at the bridge \nbetween second and third wave feminism. Intersectionality was a theoretical framework, \nwhich challenged feminism’s exclusion of women of color and disrupted the idea that \nwomen were a homogenous group and thus shared similar life experiences. Feminist \nscholarship began to examine the ways in which systematic injustices occur along lines of \nmulti-dimensional identities (i.e., when people belong to multiple discriminated groups). In \nthis section, I will 1) review the historical roots of intersectionality, and 2) describe the major \nideological tenets of the construct. \n Kimberle Williams Crenshaw (1989) is credited with coining the term \nintersectionality to examine the ways in which multiple sites of discrimination hold a \nmaterial reality for women—beyond the singular category of “women.” Being a lawyer, the \nidea first emerged as Crenshaw observed the ways in which antidiscrimination laws treated \nissues of gender and race separately. However, treating these facets of identity as separate \n\t\t\n52 \nfrom one another made it impossible to recognize the ways in which women of color \nexperienced overlapping forms of injustice that were not currently represented in feminist \ndiscourses. \n However, prior to Crenshaw’s work in 1989, Morgana & Anzaldúa (1981) published \nthe first edition of This Bridge Called My Back, an anthology of prominent feminists of color \ncalling for race-related subjectivities to be addressed, and it is credited as laying the \nfoundation for third wave feminism. Barbara Smith, one of the contributors to the anthology, \nsuggests that the anthology provided a way for these women to “find each other,” giving the \nanthology a unique momentum in the development of the conceptualization of \nintersectionality. \nAdditionally, other feminist scholars, including Patricia Hill Collins, bell hooks, and \nJudith Butler advanced arguments that pointed to conceptualizations of intersectionality, \nsuggesting that intersectional systems are necessary, because without them, experiences of \nclass, gender, sexuality, etc., cannot be fully understood without considering the influence of \nracialization. From these roots, the major ideological tenets of intersectionality emerged in \nboth epistemological assumptions and areas of praxis. The theoretical underpinnings of \nintersectionality is both an epistemological demonstration of how overlapping social \nidentities relate to systems of oppression, domination, and discrimination as a way to \nexamine how various social identities interact with one another, and as a praxis of resisting \noppression. \nBeginning with the epistemological facets of intersectionality, social identities are \nviewed as multiple, and are best understood together, rather than separately. This lends itself \nto a functionalization of intersectionality as method. That is, intersectionality has become a \n\t\t\n53 \nframework of collective assumptions about identity that can be used to critique dominant \ndiscourses and highlight the ways in which dominant ideologies are reproduced, and non-\ndominant ideologies are suppressed—particularly when multiple sites of oppression are \npresent. \n Collins (1990) describes intersectionality as a “matrix of domination,” drawing \nattention to the differences between lived experiences of women rather than their similarities \n(as was the case for much of first and second wave feminism). Drawing attention away from \nthe conceptualization of social resistance through unity and solidarity, Collins demonstrates \nthe ways in which separate lived experiences represent deeper roots of oppression and \nhighlights a wide array of discriminatory practices fueled by dominant ideologies. Yet, \nintersectionality has grown to represent more than just the overlap of race and gender, \nsnowballing to include issues of sexuality and class and continuing to move towards \nexamining other facets of multiple identities and sites of oppression and privilege. \nQueer Applications of Intersectionality \n Of particular interest to my research, queer theorists began using intersectionality as a \nframework to complicate and destabilize first generation queer theory, which is discussed in \ngreater detail in my overview of queer of color critiques. From the feminist perspective, I \nhighlight the work of Gloria Anzaldúa (1987) as she worked along the lines of both feminism \nand queer studies. Anzaldúa extrapolates the ways in which queer identities have been \noverlooked as a site of oppression and the ways in which individuals are excluded from one \nfacet of their identity in favor of another. She states: “not me abandoned my people, but they \nme,” (p. 3) in Borderlands discussing how membership to multiple social identities can be in \nconflict with one another, demonstrating how oppression and discrimination can be \n\t\t\n54 \nreproduced by members of our own intersectional identities. This includes internalized \nracism, sexism, and homophobia, where members of a particular social group take on (or \ninternalize) the discriminatory ideologies and reproduce them within their own communities \nor within themselves. \nFrom a self-reflexive standpoint, I have experienced tension between my own facets \nof identity being in conflict between the religious doxa I was raised to view the world \nthrough and my identification as lesbian and queer. That is, (be)longing—a term used by \nCarillo Rowe (2008) regarding group memberships—to a social identity as lesbian and queer \nforcibly removed me from eligibility of one of my other core identities as a member of the \nMormon Church. Karma Chavez (2004) describes this experience as being “caught between \nChristianity and insanity” (p. 255). In this way, the queering of intersectionality functions \nepistemologically to highlight not just multiple facets of identity, but also to identify the \nmultiple dominant ideologies that marginalize, exclude, and prevent individuals from \nclaiming facets of their identity (i.e., demonstrating how some identities function as mutually \nexclusive of one another). These ideological underpinnings are the foundation upon which \nanother facet of intersectionality emerges, praxis. \nFrom a praxis standpoint, and of particular interest to this study, intersectionality is \nused to advance some of the politically motivated functions of queer theory in mobilizing, \ndestabilizing, problematizing, and resisting oppression of queer bodies (also discussed further \nbelow.) I mention praxis here because Munoz (1999) examines the conceptualization of \nidentification, (counter)identification, and disidentification as sites of resistance to dominant \ndiscriminatory ideologies. Disidentification works dialectically to transcend both \nidentification (i.e., assimilation) and (counter)identification (i.e., disavowal) of dominant \n\t\t\n55 \nideologies. Disidentification functions to work within the dominant ideological system \n(incorporating facets of intersectionality) as a site of resistance and catalyst for social change. \nAt its core, queer theory seeks to disrupt heteronormativity, and intersectionality functions as \nnot simply an epistemological framework but also as a mobilizing facet of resistance \nmovements. \nSpecific to this research, I argue that (lie)alectical structures reinforce binary \ntreatments of gender and sexuality as a means of justification for discriminatory behavior. \nThat is, by representing LGBTQ-identities as static and at odds with specific heteronormative \nreligious identities, the discourse under examination works to create a rhetorically coherent \nnarrative that one can be both “Mormon” and “Gay,” while simultaneously reinforcing \nheteronormative ideologies by reducing identity to labels one chooses. On the Mormon and \nGay website, the Mormon Church describes this process of labeling: \nHow you define yourself may change throughout your life, but first and most \nimportant, you are a beloved child of God. He is the Father of your spirit.  \n \nWe should exercise care in how we label ourselves. Labels should be used \nthoughtfully and with the guidance of the Holy Ghost. Labels can affect how we think \nabout ourselves and how others treat us and may expand or limit our ability to follow \nGod’s plan for our happiness. Labels may impact our goals, sense of identity, and the \npeople we call friends. If labels get in the way of our eternal progress, we can choose \nto change them. \n \nIf one experiences same-sex attraction, he or she can choose whether to use a sexual \nidentity label. Identifying oneself as gay or lesbian is not against Church policy or \ndoctrine; however, it may have undesired consequences in the way one is treated. No \ntrue follower of Christ is justified in withholding love because you decide to identify \nin this way. \n \nOne day, at the end of this short mortal journey, we will return to the presence of our \nHeavenly Parents. One day, all other labels will be swallowed up in our eternal \nidentity as children of God. \n \n\t\t\n56 \nAs these passages demonstrate, inherent to the Mormon Church’s discourse on LGBT \nidentities is a reduction of intersectional identities as limited and ultimately inconsequential \nto “eternal identities,” which subsume all other identities. In this way, examination of \n(lie)alectical structures within the discourse being produced by the Mormon Church \nsurrounding LGBT identities, draws attention to the limitations of intersectionality as a \nconstruct—insofar as the discourse positions identities as hierarchically driven (a universal \nidentity under which all other identities are subservient and inconsequential). That is, \nintersectionality as a construct does not account for a hierarchy of identities, and thus, the \ndiscourse under examination demonstrates the ways in which intersectionality can be used to \nreinforce dominant ideologies by implementing this sense of identity hierarchy. To \ncontextualize this treatment of intersectionality, I review literature pertaining to the \ndevelopment of queer theory and the presence of intersectionality within queer theory \napplications utilized by communication scholars. \nQueer Theory \n Queer theory emerged in the early 1990s building upon feminist theories that \nconstituted gender as a function of the essential self. Exploring the complexities of the social \nconstruction of sexual acts and identities, early queer theory emphasized the role of \nindividual identities to disrupt previous communication scholarship essentializing gender and \nsexuality along a binary (i.e., Gay/Straight, Men/Women). Rather, it established a \nperspective of gender and sexuality as defined by the individual, resisting labels, and \nnormalizing these identities as multiple, fluid, unstable, and capable of change, and \nepistemologically socially constructed (Butler, 1990). In this way, the individual is \nempowered to establish his/her own identity—along lines that may or may not align with \n\t\t\n57 \ndominant discourses surrounding issues of sexual identities. Rand (2014) taps into the more \nvisceral components of the emergence of queer theory drawing attention to the “edgy and \nslightly scandalous” nature of this new area of study that arguably persists in the work of \nqueer theorists today. \nEarly Queer Theory \nEarly queer theory emerged as a post-structuralist concept aimed at deconstructing \ngender identities and stripping away the labels being used to essentialize gender identities. At \nthe level of the individual, it was possible to fluidly move between gay, straight, bi-sexual, \nand other sexualized identifiers, without requirement of establishing a stable and singular \ncategorical position of self. For example, Halperin’s (1993) approach to queer theory \nestablished a perspective of queer based on its juxtaposition to the normative. In this way, \nqueer is not simply one thing, nor is it required to remain stable; rather, its only defining \ncharacteristic is that it is not normative. \nWith this, one of the most fundamental principles defining queer theory is the point \nand purpose of avoiding stability. That is, many people find it difficult to define what queer \ntheory is, and most queer theorists would respond to this by saying: exactly! In contrast to \nmany theoretical constructs, what differentiated queer theory at its very origin was the ways \nin which it resisted conformity to normalized constructs of division and use of labels and \ncategories to differentiate itself from other disciplines. In discussing the debut and \nproliferation of queer theory, Rand (2014) draws attention to the fact that it is not so much \nthat the term queer resists being defined, but rather, its brilliance lies in the fact that it never \ndenotes one particular thing. \nCritiques of Early Queer Theory \n\t\t\n58 \nLater, conversations surrounding queer issues turned toward a critique of the primary \ntenets of queer theory—particularly its lacking in intersectional understandings of identity, \ndrawing attention to queer of color critiques, as well as transnational and other intersectional \ncomponents of identity. For all its expansions on altering discourses about gender and sexual \nidentities, critiques of early queer theory scholarship pointed to 1) problematic treatment of \nlabels and identity as they relate to political resistance, and 2) inadequate treatments of \nintersectionality (i.e., race, gender, class, etc.) from which queer of color critiques emerged. \nWhile early queer scholars did address issues of race, gender, and class, its narrow focus on \nthe individual did not account for the ways in which labels can be a site of promoting \ncollective resistance, communal relational ties, etc. Additionally, intersectionality emerged in \nthe 1980s within feminist disciplines exploring the ways in which feminist scholarship was \nexclusionary of the voices of women of color—highlighting the fact that gender alone was \nnot representative of all women’s experiences as a collective group. In a similar fashion, \nintersectionality as a construct began to appear in queer theory scholarship to complicate and \nproblematize issues of race, class, and patriarchy, to further destabilizing heteronormativity. \n Furthermore, the conceptualization of self shifted—pulling away from the \nconceptualization of individual as self, but rather identity (as related to self) is always already \nsituated as part of the larger political and social constructs that inform and influence our \nactions and interactions. Cohen (1997) addresses this through the lens of queer politics \nsuggesting that sexual expression always contains within itself the possibility of change, \nfrom moment to moment, even down to the exchanges between sex partners and sexual acts. \nThis topic has also been taken up by both queer and feminist scholars alike. Carillo Rowe \n(2008) argues this through a metaphorical construct of power lines, suggesting that the \n\t\t\n59 \nmeaning of “self” is never individual, but is “forged across a shifting set of relations that we \nmove in and out of, often without reflection” (p. 3). She suggests that power moves between \nthese places, affecting where we place our bodies and who we build our affective ties with \n(in terms of sexual acts, and also in terms of whose lives matter to us). She discusses this \nconcept as a politics of relation, highlighting the interconnectedness of all individuals by way \nof the lines of power between them. \n Within this framework, one of the largest critiques of first generation queer theory \ncame in the form of acknowledging the necessity of labels as a means of communal \nresistance. Cohen (1997) asserts that class and material privilege are affixed to queer politics \nin ways that threaten the very safety and survival of those claiming sexually resistant \nidentities, and thus, labels provide a sense of safety when the material consequences of \nmarginalization threaten the very well-being of those embodying queer identities. In similar \nfashion, Ferguson (2005) promoted a queer of color analysis within the confines of \ncapitalism, suggesting that capitalism acts as a reinforcer of heteropatriarchal universal \nnorms and examined the ways in which gender and sexual norms become racialized within \nthese capitalistic contexts. For example, in their reading of Fly Young Red’s performance of \ngay rapping, Eguchi & Roberts (2015) suggest that “the aesthetic form of ‘black male thug’ \nspecifically works as a survival tactic within and against white capitalistic heteropatriarichal \ndistributions of power” (p. 145). \n It is at this juncture that Muñoz’s (1999) conceptualization of disidentification comes \ninto play. Muñoz articulates a third mode of engaging with dominant ideologies, one that \nneither adopts the enculturation of the dominant ideology nor strictly opposes it. Rather, \nMuñoz presents disidentification as a strategy of resistance that does not attempt to break free \n\t\t\n60 \nof an inescapable sphere, but rather, seeks to bring about enduring structural change while \nsimultaneously valuing “the importance of local and everyday struggles of resistance” (p. \n27). That is, disidentification acts as a critique of early queer scholarship insofar as it disrupts \nthe essentialization of gender and sexuality, and provides a way to conceptualize resistance \n(not as a binary of identification vs. (counter)identification), but as a way to destabilize \ndominant ideologies (often heteronormativity) from within. Eguchi & Asante (2016) read \nMuñoz’s disidentifications specifically to be “a process of highlighting material realities \nproduced by the hegemonic ideology that work for and/or against minoritarian subjects” (p. \n175). As will be demonstrated in the discussion chapter, this research seeks to identify, \nhighlight, and resist the material realities of oppression that emerge from the conflict between \nLGBTQ rights in the US and anti-gay doctrines of the Christian Right to dominate public \npolicy. \n Additionally, discussions surrounding trans* bodies began to resist the “all inclusive” \nmodel of early queer theory, highlighting the under and misrepresentation of trans* persons. \nJohnson (2013) calls for intercultural scholars to address the lives of transgender persons as a \nmeans of interrupting and intervening in violence against trans* people. Yep (2013) makes a \nsimilar argument regarding transgender studies calling for a focus on “the body as a complex \nsite of meaning and knowledge” (p. 118). Focusing on the body, he seeks to build upon \nChavez’s (2003) concept of embodied translation to “engage the various theoretical and \npolitical impulses within queer and transgender studies” (p. 118). \nQueer of Color Critique \nWhile certainly under the umbrella of criticisms of first wave queer theory, queer of \ncolor critiques drew particular attention to issues of intersectionality and the material \n\t\t\n61 \nstructures that oppress queer bodies of color. I focus particularly on queer of color critique to \nexamine some of the ways intersectionality has been used within queer theory as a means of \ncomplicating current uses of intersectionality. Below I outline some of the main scholarship \nthat has emerged under the scope of queer of color critique to clarify its major tenets and \nhighlight its contributions to queer theory.  \nE. Patrick Johnson introduces the notion of “Quare” meaning “odd or slightly off \nkilter; from the African American vernacular for queer; sometimes homophobic in usage, but \nalways denotes excess incapable of being contained within conventional categories of being,” \nand beyond (p. 125). Eguchi & Roberts (2015) read Johnson to mean that the goal of quare \nstudies is to “offer a theoretical lens to carefully interrogate complex intersections of \nracialized, gendered, and class knowledge(s) embedded in the material realities of LGBT \npeople of color” (p. 145). Yep’s (2013) drive for an Intercultural approach to Queer Studies \nalso focuses on ways to understand “other bodies,” utilizing a “Queering/Quaring/Kauering” \nnotion of queer(ness). Eguchi, Calafell, & Files-Thomas (2014) complicate these ideas \nfurther in their analysis of Noah’s Arc: Jumping the Broom by examining the \nintersectionality of race, gender, sexuality, and class, arguing that the characters’ \nperformance of black gay male fantasy is reflective of mainstream US cultural ideals.  \n Alexander (2003) brings this conversation back to the university, discussing \npedagogical implication of “the black gay body” in the classroom. He draws attention to the \nstill always already existing homophobia present in the classroom, stating that: “Of course a \ngay teacher would be teaching a course in queer theory!” He furthers his argument to include \ntreating classrooms as a liminal space with “contesting cultural performances,” and contends \nthat black gay teachers are positioned in such a way that they must negotiate their identity \n\t\t\n62 \nbetween “the traditions of the academy” and “the social and cultural structures” impacting \ntheir lives (p. 254). Suganuma (2012) explores Japan’s queer culture. His conversation looks \nat Westernized perspectives on sexuality suggesting that Japanese women and men who \nengaged intimate relationships with Western men were often criticized and/or stigmatized as \nunpatriotic drawing attention to positioning of bodies of color in the media. Furthermore, \nFung (2005) engages conversations about bodily energy and sexual functioning as it pertains \nto racial identities, focusing specifically on sexual characteristics (size of penis, vagina, \ntestis, ovaries) that denote biologic control of behavior. This conversation can also be \nsituated within the larger dialogue surrounding hypersexuality of race—a topic that is not \ndirectly related to my project and therefore is not examined further in this section. Overall, \nthe queer of color critiques can be summarized to demonstrate the ways in which bodies of \ncolor are positioned within intersecting queer identities. \nReligious Treatments \nResearch on religion within the field of communication studies has largely focused on \nthe rhetorical analysis of religious discourses. However, little research has been done from a \ncritical standpoint assessing the relationship of power and domination tied to religious \ndiscourse. This section will review 1) the current scholarship that has been done on religious \ndiscourses, 2) discuss the gap in critical treatment of religious discourse, and 3) overview the \nliterature pertaining specifically to a conceptualization of Christianity as a site of privilege in \nthe US to substantiate the necessity for this research. \nCritical Critiques of Religious Discourse \nIn the mid to late 2000s, a small body of critically-oriented research emerged \nexamining the religious climate in the US post 9-11, particularly as tensions between \n\t\t\n63 \nChristian and Muslim identities became more prominent in media coverage, politicizing \nreligion and creating more visibility of religion as core facets of identity. Sentiments of “the \nWar on Christianity” became more visible in discourses as the conceptualization of \n“Religious Freedoms” became complicated by the extension of religious freedoms to non-\nChristians (huffingtonpost.com).  Asthana (2008) asserts that the tension between secularism \nand religion needs to be addressed and claims that the political and religious conflicts are \noften represented as secularism against religion and are “incompatible value systems” (p. \n305). Additionally, Keaten & Soukup (2009) situate the “religious other” and offer a model \nof “pluralistic interfaith dialogue,” calling out scholars for not valuing “devout faith (i.e., \nfaith in a “capital T Truth)” and suggests that, as communication scholars, “we should not act \nas subjects examining others under our proverbial microscopes via our ‘objective’ research \nmethodologies” (p. 184). In essence, Keaten & Soukup (2009) were responding to the \ncriticism of academia to be intolerant of religious beliefs as “valid,” which partially explains \nour discipline’s lack of attention to religious identities, particularly within discussions of \nintersectionality. However, Keaten & Soukup’s (2009) work does not account for \ninternational research and development done within the discipline on religious topics. \n Beyond this “blip on the radar,” religion has gone largely unexamined by critical \nscholars utilizing intersectional frameworks, despite the fact that it is often listed in the \ncategories of identity memberships when discussing intersectionality. Chavez (2004) argues \nthat any study of religion and morality is inextricably tied up with intersectional facets such \nas race, gender, and sexuality—particularly focusing on the ways in which religious \norganizations are still largely separated by race and exclusionary of deviant gender and sex \npractices within US contexts. Additionally, Collier (2014) has included in her research in \n\t\t\n64 \nNepal, Northern Ireland, and the US the role of Christian churches in addressing issues of \npoverty. \nProphetic Pragmatism \nWithin the critically-oriented research pertaining to religious discourses, Cornel \nWest’s conceptualization of “Prophetic Pragmatism” addresses the role of religion in his \nphilosophy of liberation. Stone (2011) suggests that West’s ultimate objective is “Black \nliberation, followed by the liberation of all the oppressed people of the world” (p. 92). West’s \nfocus of prophetic practices “preaching, powerful praying, dancing, and music” is \ndemonstrative of Stone’s critique of West’s prophetic pragmatism that: \nIn slavery, blacks were in a state of domination, yet there was just enough freedom \nfor slaves to create songs about emancipation and final retribution on the day of \njudgments…After emancipation, yet still limited in freedom due to Jim Crow, \nAfrican-Americans developed even more practices of freedom that served as \nresistance to white supremacy” (p. 104). \n \n Essentially, West’s Prophetic Pragmatism elucidates the ways in which religious \npractices have historically worked as a site of resistance insofar as these practices are “an \nAfro-American philosophy that is essentially a specific expression of contemporary \nAmerican philosophy which takes seriously the Afro-American experience” (West, 1982, p. \n11). In this way, West treats prophetic practices (i.e., one form of religious discourse) as a \nsite of resistance against oppression and white supremacy. In quite the reverse, this research \nfocuses on the treatment of religious discourses that work to reify dominant oppressive \nideologies, specifically heteronormativity. \nChristian Privilege \nOf particular interest to my body of research, I argue that Christian denominations in \nthe US function to marginalize, exclude, and exploit non-Christians—privileging Christianity \n\t\t\n65 \nand/or those who claim a Christian identity. For the purposes of this research, I define \nChristianity as any religious organization that largely derives its doctrinal tenets from the \nNew Testament, and/or the divinity of Christ. As such, I treat Mormonism as a Christian-\nbased religion, although it is noteworthy that other Christian denominations do not consider \nMormonism to be a Christian religion. I limit the focus of this discussion to the US because \nthis research seeks to investigate the relationship between current legislative conversations in \nthe US that engage the tension between conservative-Christian discourses and queer \nactivism. I begin this conversation with a discussion of how Christianity reinforces and \nbenefits from dominant cultural practices in the US \n Blumenfeld, Joshi, & Fairchild (2008) argue that the concept of religious freedom \nwas derived from the predominantly Puritan denominations fleeing from England in search \nof a place where they could practice their religious beliefs freely, and that “their agenda for \nreligious freedom was limited to their own freedom, which they did not extend to other \nreligious groups” (p. vii). Expanding on this supposition, I argue that while there were many \ndifferent denominations of Christianity in the US at the inception of the constitution, the first \namendment’s guarantee of religious freedom—still drawn upon today—was created under \nthe umbrella of predominantly Christian practices, and thus, the legislation defining religious \nfreedom was largely influenced by the tenets of Christian ideologies. This was reinforced by \nthe 1924 anti-immigration law called the “National Origins Act” restricting immigration \nfrom Eastern and Southern Europe as a means of “protecting our values as a Western \nChristian civilization” (Blumenfeld, 2008, p. 11). In more recent arguments, Harvey (2008) \nsuggests that anti-same-sex marriage stances are directly a violation of church and state \ninsofar as the equivocation of “American” as “Christian” had dominated moral debates of not \n\t\t\n66 \nonly sexuality but also abortion, sex education in secondary schools, school prayer, and \npornography. \n Additionally, Blumenfeld, Joshi, and Fairchild (2008) argue that Christian privilege \ncomprises a large array of benefits that are often invisible, unearned, and unacknowledged by \nChristians and is often maintained by their relative invisibility. This invisibility is fortified by \nthe doctrine of separation of church and state. With this invisibility, Christian privilege is not \nanalyzed, scrutinized, interrogated nor confronted. Morris’s (2015) queer reading of John \nMurphy’s rhetorical analysis of Barack Obama’s “turn to the past” speech indirectly \nhighlights this invisibility of Christianity. This correlation is seen through the connection \nbetween Americanism and Christianity in his examination of an article published in The \nAdvocate in August 2012 headlining: IN OBAMA WE TRUST. Even within discourses \nsurrounding resistance to the Christian Right, discourses persist in utilizing Christian-\noriented phrases, associating “Obama” with “God,” and I argue that this instance points to an \nassociation of God and Christianity to the very core of Christian infiltration into \ngovernmental practices. That is, many of the Christian-based practices and emblems that are \nwoven into the conceptualization of America/American are becoming a site of resistance and \narguably disidentification with these practices and emblems that normalize Christian \nideologies and dictate political practices that advance Christianity as a site of privilege. \nAs pointed to in the introduction of this research, Crowley (2007) furthers this \nconversation in Tolerance and the Christian Right, arguing that since the 1970s when \n“previously disenfranchised groups sued for admittance to civic participation” Christian \nintellectuals have “redefined the liberal value of tolerance as a radical relativism that \nrestrains Christians from passing moral judgments on beliefs and practices of which they \n\t\t\n67 \ndisapprove” (p. 102). Crowley’s argument engages Christian privilege in discussing how \n“Christian conservatives” aim to reinforce dominant ideologies, insofar as they “wish to \nimpose a standard of moral behavior on all of us so that they can easily discern—and \ndiscipline—those who depart from it (p. 104). I include this discussion on Christian privilege \nto highlight Mormonism’s potential influence to advance legislation that would seek to \nreinforce laws that sustain their homophobic doctrines and to propose legislation that would \nreverse pro-LGBTQ legislation, essentially (un)queering spaces that have made movement \ntoward equal rights in the US as it pertains to the LGBTQ community. \nConclusion \nThe essential nature of any good literature review is to situate the current proposed \nresearch within the context of a web of conversations that began long before this research \nwas conceptualized and will continue on long after it has been written. Kenneth Burke (1969) \nspeaks to the necessity and nature of situating one’s research analogously through a cocktail \nparty metaphor: \nImagine that you enter a parlor. You come late. When you arrive, others have long \npreceded you, and they are engaged in a heated discussion, a discussion too heated for \nthem to pause and tell you exactly what it is about. In fact, the discussion had already \nbegun long before any of them got there, so that no one present is qualified to retrace \nfor you all the steps that had gone before. You listen for a while, until you decide that \nyou have caught the tenor of the argument; then you put in your oar. Someone \nanswers; you answer him [sic]; another comes to your defense; another aligns himself \n[sic] against you, to either the embarrassment or gratification of your opponent, \ndepending upon the quality of your ally's assistance. However, the discussion is \ninterminable. The hour grows late, you must depart. And you do depart, with the \ndiscussion still vigorously in progress. (p. 83) \n \n Within this analogy, this chapter functions to communicate my understanding of the \nconversations that precede my research. Queer theory and intersectionality are complex \nconcepts that speak to each other from different disciplines, advancing perspectives, \n\t\t\n68 \ncritiquing those perspectives with a trajectory rooted in complicating, problematizing, and \nchallenging not only the discourses it critiques, but also the theories themselves. Within this \ncontext, I situate my research as recent, relevant, and applicable to the work of queer theory \nand intersectionality that precedes this study. In so doing, I offer a definition of queer as both \ncomplex and specifically focused on gender and sexuality as it pertains to the chosen topic of \nthis research in the process of defending the place and purpose of this research to contribute \nto continuing conversations about the interconnectedness of these theories. Additionally, I \ncall for more critical research to be applied in analyzing dominant religious ideologies. Next, \nI outline two new theoretical frameworks: (lie)alectics and dequeerification and provide an \nexplanation of how these theories work within the methodological assumptions of critical \nrhetoric and how I apply critical rhetoric through textual and thematic analysis. \n\t\t\n69 \nCHAPTER 4 \nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY \nIntroduction \nIn this study, I propose two new theoretical frameworks: (Lie)alectics and discursive \ndequeerification. Regarding the first, this research is built upon a theoretical construct that \nemerged from the analysis of the Mormon Church’s press conference on religious freedoms \nand nondiscrimination. From this research, the conceptualization of (lie)alectics emerged as a \nrhetorical construct that demonstrates the ways in which the discourse attempts to position \nPoF as the dialectical opposite of LGBT-identified individuals. To extrapolate the mechanics \nof (lie)alectics, this chapter will first provide an overview of traditional dialectics and provide \na rationale for utilizing a Hegelian approach to dialectics. Second, this chapter will provide \nan overview of previous research utilizing (lie)alectics as a way to demonstrate how these \nstructures work. Regarding the second theoretical framework, this chapter provides an \noverview of discursive deracialization as the existing framework upon which the concept of \ndiscursive dequeerification emerges and provides an explanation of discursive \ndequeerification as a queer counterpart to deracialization. Last, this chapter reviews the \nmethodological assumptions of this research and provides a detailed account of the methods \nused to carry out this research. \nDialectics \nThe theory of (lie)alectics is predicated upon traditional dialectical frameworks \ncommonly used in rhetorical analysis of texts. At its core, dialectics describes a philosophical \nmethod of argument-making that involves the acknowledgement of multiple contradictory \n\t\t\n70 \ntruths—predicated upon the philosophical assumption that everything has an opposite, and \nthose opposites are both in unity and mutually exclusive. Plato’s notion of dialectics \n(commonly attributed as the birth place of dialectics) was a back-and-forth process of \npresenting arguments that would progressively produce a more complete truth (i.e., similar to \nthe post-positivist procedure—the more you cannot prove a claim is false, the truer it \nbecomes, and therefore the more counter-arguments the thesis can withstand, the more likely \nit is to be True)14. \nWithin philosophical traditions of dialectics, dealing mainly with formal logic, Plato’s \nform of dialectics has been critiqued for its limitation in notions of premises/theses, upon \nwhich contradictions simply lead to nothingness or a collapse of premises/theses (i.e., Plato’s \nform of dialectics failed to acknowledge the notion that every thesis has an antithesis). This is \nparticularly true of Hegel’s critique of Plato. Hegel suggested that reason in-and-of-itself \ngenerated contradictions insofar as in order for something to be something, it must also not \nbe something else (i.e., a cow cannot also be a horse, etc.). And, that in order to have a \nquality of something(ness), there must be other objects/entities similar enough in nature that \nindividual “somethings” (e.g., apples) can be identified and separated out enough to be \ndistinguished from other “somethings” (e.g., oranges). This notion, in-and-of-itself, is the \nbackbone of Hegel’s approach to dialectics insofar as apples cannot be oranges, and oranges \ncannot be apples, but, they can both be fruits (i.e., a conceptualization of something(ness) \nthat can logically subsume both entities and create new knowledge beyond each \nindividualized concept/entity when the nature of both entities is investigated in context of \neach other). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n14 Note that Plato subscribed to the notion of absolute Truths that could be understood but not \nre-created by humans. \n\t\t\n71 \nWithin the notions of formal logic, Hegelian perspectives on dialectics is particularly \nsuited for this study, because it calls into question the logic (or perhaps more aptly illogical \nnature) of the claims being made. That is, by identifying the logical fallacies within \narguments set up dialectically, identifying those fallacies reveals the underlying ideological \nbeliefs/systems at work that aim to reinforce themselves. That is, (lie)alectics is an \napplication of identifying systems of logic that attempt to force reality to be what it wants it \nto be instead of what it actually is. As such, this research utilizes a Hegelian approach to \ndialectics, specifically his advancement of the thesis-antithesis-synthesis model. Hegel \nadvanced this model to demonstrate the ways in which multiple incommensurate truths can \ncreate new meaning without cancelling out or replacing the earlier concepts—specifically \nbecause the new meaning relies on the previous concepts for its own definition. For example, \nfrom independence and dependence a new meaning of interdependence can arise, \nsublimating both concepts, yet dependent upon the presence of the individual truths of each \nconcept to understand how interdependence functions concurrently. With this in mind, I now \nprovide an overview of the initial research from which the notion of (lie)alectics emerges as \nthe theoretical framework for this study. \nThe Nature of (Lie)alectics \nTurning to the discourse examined in the theoretical development of (lie)alectics, the \nReligious Freedoms and Nondiscrimination press conference calls for legislation that \nprotects both RFs and ND, representing these principles as dialectical opposites. For \nexample, the discourse proclaims: Yes! The Church supports nondiscrimination against the \nLGBT community in “fair access to housing and employment” (Newsroom, 2015, n.p.). \nBut…when these issues of ND force PoF to go “against his or her own \n\t\t\n72 \nconscience…especially when others are readily available to perform that function” then RFs \nbecome dialectically incommensurate with nondiscrimination (Newsroom, 2015, n.p.). Yet, \nunder a Hegelian treatment, the dialectical representations made in the Religious Freedoms \nand Nondiscrimination press conference are inconsistent with theoretical conceptualizations \nof dialectics as in being unified and mutually exclusive. In this way, the discourse under \nexamination makes stylistic maneuvers that enables the Mormon Church to appear to be \ninclusive of multiple truths (both, and…), but when examined closely, pairs/compares \nconcepts that are not mutually exclusive, and thus becomes a discourse of exclusion (yes, \nbut…). In this example, the dialectical opposite of religious freedoms would be religious \noppression, not nondiscrimination. Likewise, the dialectical opposite of nondiscrimination \nwould be discrimination, not religious freedoms. Consequently, positioning non-antithetical \nideas as though they were antithetical effectively prevents synthesis from occurring. \nThus, the conceptualization of (lie)alectics is a theory outlining stylistic tendencies \nwithin a text to represent non-dialectical ideas/concepts as dialectical opposites. The point \nand purpose of (lie)alectics is to accomplish exclusion of specific ideologies by appearing \ninclusive of multiple truths. With this understanding, I provide three examples from my \nanalysis of the Religious Freedoms and Nondiscrimination press conference to demonstrate \nhow (lie)alectics function as a rhetorical strategy of exclusion. \nUnpacking Disguised Discrimination within (Lie)alectics \nIn doing a close reading of the Religious Freedoms and Nondiscrimination press \nconference transcript, I identified the discourse’s stylistic tendency to use textual proximity \nof non-antithetical ideas to create (lie)alectical tensions between two commensurate ideas. \nThat is, the text uses juxtaposition of non-competing ideas to generate contrast between two \n\t\t\n73 \nnon-antithetical ideas. Additionally, polarized language choices also indicate these tensions. \nUtilizing elements of thematic analysis, I identified three significant (lie)alectical tensions \nthat (with no potential for synthesis) pit Religious Freedoms against LGBT rights in areas of \nadvocacy, the freedom/rights themselves, and discrimination: 1) Advocates of Religious \nFreedoms are treated as the dialectical opposite of Advocates for LGBT rights (Advocating \n(Lie)alectic); 2) Religious Freedoms are treated as the dialectical opposite of \nNondiscrimination (Religious Freedom / Nondiscrimination (Lie)alectic); and 3) Areas of \nDiscrimination are treated as the dialectical opposite of Democratic Justice (Discrimination \n(Lie)alectic). Below, I outline each (lie)alectic and provide examples from the text to \nsubstantiate (lie)alectics as a theory. \nThe advocating (lie)alectic. The first (lie)alectical tension identified in the text \nplaced Advocates for Religious Freedoms as dialectically opposite of Advocates for LGBT \nRights. However, when examined closely, it becomes obvious that the dialectical opposite of \nAdvocates for Religious Freedoms would be advocates for religious oppression, and the \ndialectical opposite of Advocates for LGBT Rights would be Advocates for LGBT \nOppression. Table 1 demonstrates how these two concepts, when placed falsely in tension, \ncreate a relationship between the two concepts being compared. Table 1 reveals the \nunderlying ideological assumptions being made by the Mormon Church regarding issues of \nsupporting LGBT legislation. \nPassages from the transcript provide direct evidence of the (lie)alectics as well as \nevidence of the structural use of proximity of non-antithetical ideas and use of polarized \nlanguage. \n• We want to share with you our concerns about the increasing tensions and \n\t\t\n74 \npolarization between advocates of religious freedom on the one hand, and advocates \nof gay rights on the other. \n• The debate we speak of today is about how to affirm rights for some without taking \naway from the rights of others. \n• On one side of the debate we have advocates of LGBT rights…Meanwhile those who \nseek the protection of religious conscience and expression and the free exercise of \ntheir religion look with alarm at the steady erosion of treasured freedoms. \n• It is one of today’s great ironies that some people who have fought so hard for LGBT \nrights now try to deny the rights of others to disagree with their public policy \nproposals. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere are several inherent flaws in treating Advocates for Religious Freedoms as the \ndialectical opposite of Advocates for LGBT rights. These flaws include: 1) the assumption \nthat Advocates for Religious Freedoms cannot simultaneously be Advocates for LGBT rights; \n\t\t\n75 \n2) it situates religious beliefs as ontologically equal (yet empirically superior) to sexual \nidentity and orientation; and 3) it lacks ontological consistency in the treatment of agency. \nTogether, these flaws embody ideological assumptions that suggest that there is an inherent \ndifference between PoF and LGBT individuals and positions the latter with inferiority. \nBy the very nature of dialectical tensions, treating Advocates of LGBT rights as the \ndialectical opposite of Advocates of Religious Freedoms suggests that a single individual \ncannot be an advocate for both. The logical flaw of this treatment, I should hope, is quite \nclear. There are many examples of PoF that advocate for LGBT rights, welcome LGBT \nindividuals into their congregations, while simultaneously maintaining their religious \nfreedoms.15 These examples demonstrate an issue of coherence in this (lie)alectic, which is \nfurther exemplified when looking at the way the text situates religious beliefs as superior to \nsexual identity and orientation. \nSituating Advocates of LGBT rights as dialectically opposite of Advocates of \nReligious Freedom, particularly when the transcript is advocating for religious freedoms that \nwould exempt PoF from sustaining LGBT rights, positions Advocates of LGBT rights as \ninferior to Advocates of Religious Freedoms. This treatment of LGBT individuals as inferior \nis evident in the examples provided in the text (which valorizes PoF), the sheer bulk of text \ndedicated to outlining religious freedoms, and the simple fact that the press conference is \nbeing delivered by self-proclaimed PoF. \nThe transcript offers several examples and narratives that valorize PoF and demonize \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n15\tThese include Episcopalians, First Congregational churches, Lutherans, some Pentecostal \ndenominations (Affirming Pentecostal Church, Covenant Network, The Fellowship of \nReconciling Pentecostal International), some Presbyterian denominations, the United \nMethodist Church, and most Unitarian denominations.\t\n\t\t\n76 \nthose supporting LGBT rights: \nSeveral years ago, an Olympic gold-medal gymnast—a Latter-day Saint, as it \nhappened—had been selected to lead the American delegation to the Olympic Games. \nHe was pressured to resign as the symbolic head of the team because gay rights \nadvocates protested that he had supported Proposition 8 in California. Ironically, he \nwas denied the same freedom of conscience that commentators demanded for the gay \nathletes he would symbolically represent. \n \nRecently in one of America’s largest cities, government lawyers subpoenaed the \nsermons and notes of pastors who opposed parts of a new law on religious grounds. \nThese pastors faced not only intimidation, but also criminal prosecution for insisting \nthat a new gay rights ordinance should be put to a vote of the people. \n \nIn these two narratives, the Advocates for Gay Rights are demonized, while the PoF \n(the Latter-day Saint gymnast and pastor) in this story are situated as both hero and victim—\nvalorizing them, and thus, communicating superiority. This superiority is communicated in \nother ways as well: \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that sexual relations other \nthan between a man and a woman who are married are contrary to the laws of God. \nThis commandment and doctrine comes from sacred scripture and we are not at \nliberty to change it…There’s ample evidence in the life of Jesus Christ to demonstrate \nthat He stood firm for living the laws of God, yet reached out to those who had been \nmarginalized even though He was criticized for doing so. \n \nIn this passage, the church asserts a belief that homosexuality is contrary to God’s \nlaw. Within Mormon doctrine, God is believed to be all-knowing and all-powerful. Thus, to \nsuggest that homosexuality is in contrast to an all-supreme being is to communicate a sense \nof inferiority to those who accept and uphold the standards of the God depicted by \nMormonism—a form of religious determinism. Last, the transcript proclaims: “We reject \npersecution and retaliation of any kind, including persecution based on race, ethnicity, \nreligious belief, economic circumstance or differences in gender or sexual orientation” \n(Newsroom, 2015, n.p.). Here, the arrangement of the text communicates inferiority in \n\t\t\n77 \nplacing gender and sexual orientation as the last component to be contemplated when \nconsidering persecution and retaliation. \nAnother way in which this positioning is accomplished is through the treatment of \nagency in the text. Historically, an underlying assumption of the Mormon Church is that \ngender identity and sexual orientation are not inherent facets of identity, but rather, an issue \nof agency. By positioning PoF as the dialectical opposite of LGBT individuals, this would \nrequire LGBT individuals to have full control over their choices to participate in a \nhomosexual lifestyle—the same way that PoF have full choice over participating in religious \nactivities. However, this perspective is flawed. There is, in fact, a significant amount of \ncredible research that supports the biological inherency of sexual orientation (for many \nindividuals) including the American Psychological Association. Accepting this research as \nvalid, for this dialectic to be coherent, certain beliefs would have to be biologically inherent \nto PoF for issues of agency to be consistent. There is no such data that would suggest that \nPoF lack the agency to choose to hold certain beliefs—that religious faith and conscience are \ninherently biological—the way that racial characteristics and sexual identity are biologically \ngoverned. Taken together, these flaws demonstrate an inconsistent and incoherent argument \nthat Advocates for Religious Freedoms are the dialectical opposite of Advocates for LGBT \nRights. \nThe religious freedoms / nondiscrimination (lie)alectic. This discourse treats RF as \nthe dialectical opposite of ND. This treatment ensures, then, that RF must be defined as \ndiscriminatory in order to be the dialectical opposite of ND. The subject of this discourse is \nspecifically the (lie)alectical tension that is created by suggesting that LGBT-identified \nindividuals should be guaranteed some rights, but that RF (even though discriminatory) \n\t\t\n78 \nshould exist simultaneously to ensure that PoF are not required to uphold those rights. Table \n2 demonstrates how the relationship between these two concepts is distorted through the \n(lie)alectical interchange. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The language of the text uses the words “Rights” and “Freedoms” dialectically to \njustify unlimited religious freedoms verses protection of some rights in some areas:  \n• We call on local, state and the federal government to serve all of their people by passing \nlegislation that protects vital religious freedoms for individuals, families, churches, and \nother faith groups while also protecting the rights of our LGBT citizens in such areas as \nhousing, employment and public accommodations in hotels, restaurants and \ntransportation. \n• With understanding and goodwill, including some give and take, none of these rights \nguaranteed to people of faith will encroach on the rights of gay men and women who \nwish to live their lives according to their own rights and principles. \n \n\t\t\n79 \nOne way this discourse justifies this positioning of RF as the dialectical opposite of \nND is the treatment of the words “Rights” and “Freedoms.” Rights are defined as “a moral or \nlegal entitlement to have or obtain something or to act in certain ways” (OED). Freedoms are \ndefined as “the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or \nrestraint” (Oxford English Dictionary). By treating these two terms as dialectical opposites, \nthe discourse suggests that some people should have Rights, “legal entitlement,” while others \nshould have Freedoms, “power to act without restraint.” Thus, to place “LGBT Rights / ND” \nas the dialectical opposite of the RF of PoF ensures that LGBT individuals will be guaranteed \n“legal entitlement” to housing, employment, and public accommodations, but that PoF \nsimultaneously have RF – which positions PoF as exempt from sustaining these rights \nbecause they are enabled to “act without restraint,” based on their “deeply held religious \nbeliefs” (Newsroom, 2015). \nAdditionally, while the transcript positions “Rights” and “Freedoms” dialectically in \nsome places, it also demands recognition that “individual people of faith must maintain their \nconstitutional rights,” extending the privilege of both rights and freedoms to PoF. The \ntranscript suggests that: “The eventual outcome of this debate will influence to a large extent \nwhether millions of people with diverse backgrounds and different views and values will live \ntogether in relative harmony for the foreseeable future” (Newsroom, 2015, n.p.). Yet, while \nstating that “the Church has publically favored laws and ordinances that protect LGBT \npeople from discrimination in housing and employment” the transcript later suggests that \nthese nondiscrimination laws violate RF in areas of housing, employment, and education: \n• What kinds of religious rights are we talking about? To begin with, we refer to the \nconstitutionally guaranteed right of religious communities to function according to \nthe dictates of their faith: \n\t\t\n80 \no They would embrace such matters as employment, honor code standards, and \naccreditation at church schools. That is because church-owned businesses or \nentities that are directly related to the purposes and functions of the church \nmust have the same latitude in employment standards and practices as the \nchurch itself. \no They include the right to use church properties in accordance with their beliefs \nwithout second-guessing from government. \no Certainly, religious rights must include a family’s right to worship and \nconduct religious activities in the home as it sees fit, and for parents to teach \ntheir children according to their religious values – recognizing that when \nchildren are old enough they will choose their own path. \n \nThese passages communicate the (lie)alectical trajectory of this discourse. To suggest \nthat two different groups of people (with incommensurate beliefs) can live in “relative \nharmony,” but to imply that this harmony can only be achieved by enacting legislation that \nwould exempt PoF from having to sustain LGBT rights, is indicative of the exclusionary \nnature of (lie)alectical discourse. That is, the discourse supports legislation that enhances \nLGBT rights, but then advocates the exclusion of PoF from sustaining the very same rights \nthe transcript purports to support—employment, housing, and public accommodation. \n Having been raised in the Mormon faith myself, I am able to identify the implications \nof these statements because of my knowledge of Mormon-related vocabulary, such as “honor \ncode standards.” These honor code standards are aimed at discrimination regarding housing. \nThese honor code standards are directly related to housing policies at Mormon-owned \nuniversities including Brigham Young University (BYU), BYU-Idaho, and BYU-Hawaii. \nStudents attending these schools are required to live in BYU approved housing, which \nrequire honor code standards. These honor code standards include adherence to BYU \npolicies. The very mention of honor code standards suggests that these properties could \nexclude LGBT individuals from living in these properties because the Mormon Church \n\t\t\n81 \nopposes same-sex relationships. These properties are contracted with BYU with the caveat \nthat “students who attend [church accredited schools] are the only tenants who can live in \nBYU contracted housing…no one else qualifies to live in BYU contracted housing.” (BYU \nCampus Housing, n.p.). \nBy ascertaining “BYU contracted housing,” the Mormon Church is essentially \nproviding themselves with a way to discriminate against LGBT individuals. Thus, sustaining \na RF act would ensure the church’s right to discriminate against LGBT individuals (and \nothers for that matter) if they are not in adherence with what the Mormon Church deems \nappropriate based on their “deeply held religious beliefs.” \n Additionally, the transcript provides several examples of areas where PoF should not \nbe required to perform certain procedures (i.e., abortions and artificial inseminations), but \nspecifically makes this contingent for lesbian couples—not the general population. Their \nreasoning for this is that “others are readily available” to perform these procedures, and thus, \nPoF should not be coerced to go against their “deeply held religious beliefs.” \n• In addition to institutional protections, individual people of faith must maintain their \nconstitutional rights. This would include living in accordance with their deeply held \nreligious beliefs, including choosing their profession or employment and serving in \npublic office without intimidation, coercion or retaliation from another group. \no For example, a Latter-day Saint physician who objects to performing abortions or \nartificial insemination for a lesbian couple should not be forced against his or her \nconscience to do so, especially when others are readily available to perform that \nfunction. \no Another example, a neighborhood Catholic pharmacist, who declines to carry the \n“morning after” pill when large pharmacy chains readily offer them, should likewise \nnot be pressured into violating his or her conscience by bullying or boycotting. \n \nThese passages, again, demonstrate the (lie)alectical approach of the discourse, \ncalling for caveats that would exempt all PoF from performing job specifications if they go \n\t\t\n82 \nagainst their “deeply held religious beliefs.” That is, the Mormon Church argues that PoF \nought to be allowed to perform artificial insemination procedures for heterosexual couples, \nbut should not be required to perform them for LGBT-identified individuals. Thus, even \nthough LGBT identified individuals can receive these procedures by equally qualified \ndoctors, allowing some doctors to refuse these procedures based solely on the sexual identity \nor orientation of the patients is evidence of the exclusionary function of this (lie)alectical \nargument. \nDiscrimination (lie)alectic. In this (lie)alectic, the Religious Freedoms and \nNondiscrimination press conference positions PoF as equally discriminated against as the \nLGBT community. The transcript positions PoF and the LGBT community as existing on the \nsame side of the dialectic, with Democratic Justice at the other end of the dialectic. Perhaps \nthe most basic flaw of this (lie)alectic is that it runs counter to the implied ideologies of the \nother two. The first (lie)alectic positions PoF as dialectically opposite of LGBT-identified \nindividuals in areas of advocacy; this is an inconsistent treatment that places PoF as both \ndialectically opposite and dialectically equal to the LGBT community. The second \n(lie)alectic positions RF as the dialectical opposite of ND—thus, it is incoherent to suggest \nthat RF are dialectically a form of discrimination, but that discrimination is the dialectical \nopposite of Democratic Justice. Table 3 outlines this (lie)alectic. To explore this (lie)alectic \nfurther, the following excerpts from the discourse provide direct evidence of this (lie)alectic: \n•  [The LGBT rights] movement arose after centuries of ridicule, persecution and even \nviolence against homosexuals. \n• Today, state legislatures across the nation are being asked to strengthen laws related to \nLGBT issues in the interest of ensuring fair access to housing…At the same time, we \nurgently need laws that protect faith communities and individuals against discrimination \nand retaliation for claiming the core rights of free expression and religious practice that \nare at the heart of our identity as a nation and our legacy as citizens. \n\t\t\n83 \n• Accusations of bigotry toward people simply because they are motivated by their \nreligious faith and conscience have a chilling effect on freedom of speech and public \ndebate. When religious people are publically intimidated, retaliated against, forced from \nemployment or made to suffer personal loss because they have raised their voice in the \npublic square, donated to a cause or participated in an election, our democracy is the \nloser. Such tactics are every bit as wrong as denying access to employment, housing, or \npublic services because of race or gender. \n• Nothing is achieved if either side resorts to bullying, political point scoring or \naccusations of bigotry. \n• In addition to institutional protections, individual people of faith must maintain their \nconstitutional rights…including choosing their profession or employment and serving in \npublic office without intimidation, coercion or retaliation from another group…A \nneighborhood Catholic pharmacist, who declines to carry the “morning after” pill when \nlarge pharmacy chains readily offer them, should likewise not be pressured into violating \nhis or her conscience by bullying or boycotting. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\n84 \nThere is a clear discrepancy between the listed areas of discrimination in the \ntranscript. Perhaps the first most obvious disconnect is what is NOT included in the \ntranscript, which is the acknowledgement of the presence and severity of the social injustices \ncommitted against the LGBT community. The transcript generalizes this discrimination, \nstating that the pursuit of LGBT rights came after “centuries of ridicule, persecution and even \nviolence against homosexuals” (Newsroom, 2015, n.p.) and conveniently leaves out any \nspecific examples of this historical ridicule, persecution, and violence committed against \nmembers of the LGBT community. Regarding RF however, the transcript is explicit in the \ninjustices that have been committed against PoF simply because they are “motivated by their \nreligious faith and conscience” (Newsroom, 2015, n.p.).  \nLooking closer at the listed areas of discrimination toward PoF, there is a proportional \ninconsistency in the areas of discrimination listed in the transcript—the listed areas of \ndiscrimination against PoF lack the level of severity and material consequence of the areas of \ndiscrimination against the LGBT community. Essentially, the Mormon Church is equating \nname-calling and negative reactions to their political views as instances of discrimination. \nThe transcript is insistent that “accusations of bigotry” are a type of “bullying” that has \n“become so extreme that they threaten to tear apart the very fabric of society” (Newsroom, \n2015). When comparing these areas of discrimination against PoF to the historical atrocities \ncommitted against marginalized communities, name-calling and negative media coverage \nhardly compares to a gay 21-year-old boy being heinously beaten, strung up on a barbed-wire \nfence, and left to die—as was the case in the Matthew Shepherd murder. \nFurthermore, examining the definition of discrimination nullifies these claims. \nDiscrimination is defined as “making an unjust or prejudicial distinction in the treatment of \n\t\t\n85 \ndifferent categories of people or things based solely on that distinction, esp. race, gender, \nage, etc.” (OED). The first logical fallacy in treating “accusations of bigotry” and “public \nretaliation” as elements of discrimination aimed at PoF solely on their self-imposed \nidentification, is that the areas they are defining as discrimination do not meet the demands of \nthe definition. Name-calling and negative reactions to public displays of anti-gay policies is \nnot uniquely or solely imposed upon PoF, nor is it imposed BECAUSE a person claims to be \na Person of Faith. Rather, the enactment of freedom of speech in the form of name-calling \nand political backlash is imposed on anti-gay messages—not because of who is saying it—\nbut because it is being said at all. \nIn short, this pairing of PoF as dialectical equals of LGBT-identified individuals in \nterms of discrimination requires that faith, beliefs, conscience, and religion must be a facet of \nidentity the way that race, gender, and age are facets of identity. Returning to my original \ndefinition of (lie)alectics as a pairing/comparing of non-antithetical concepts, the transcript \ndoes not meet the burden of proof necessary to place PoF as dialectically opposite of \nDemocratic Justice. Yet, it is upon these areas of discrimination that the Mormon Church \ncalls for RF that protect the rights of PoF, equating themselves as an equally marginalized \ncommunity with equal claim to social justice. \nI utilize these three examples of (lie)alectics to substantiate these structures as an \nidentifiable rhetorical strategy of exclusion. As the analysis of this study will further \nillustrate, the particular utility of these (lie)alectics goes beyond a simple matter of false \ndialectics. Rather, (lie)alectics reach beyond the dichromatic nature of dialectical tensions \n(including false ones) and highlight the material realities of discourses that have the capacity \nto appear inclusive and nondiscriminatory while still promoting exclusion and \n\t\t\n86 \ndiscrimination. I argue that (lie)alectical structures are similar to the rhetorical maneuvers \nmade in deracialized speech. Bertrand’s (2004) discussion of deracialization assesses the \nways in which discourse constructs “new racism” through strategies of deracialization to \nindirectly reinforce racist ideologies. In a similar fashion, I argue that conservative discourses \naround issues of sexuality and gender often utilize strategies of discursive dequeerification—\na proposed queer counterpart to the theoretical construct of discursive deracialization—to \nindirectly reinforce homophobic and heteronormative ideologies. I argue that the progression \nof the Gay Rights Movement has put pressure on conservative discourses to appear non-\nhomophobic through the erasure of explicitly homophobic language. In its place, \n(lie)alectical structures emerge as an implicit tactic that allows dominant ideologies (i.e., \nheteronormativity) to be perpetuated in a way that reduces the perceived validity of \ncounterhegemonic voices—reinforcing dominant ideologies. To substantiate these claims and \nmy theoretical proposal of discursive dequeerification, I provide an overview of discursive \nderacialization and then a discussion of its queer counterpart, discursive dequeerification. \nAn Overview of Discursive Deracialization \nDiscursive deracialization is a term introduced by Augoustinos and Every “in which \nthe potentially racial element of the talk is removed and replaced with a non-racial \nexplanation” (Goodman, 2017, p. 308). Discursive deracialization has been categorized as a \nfunction of new racism and post-racial rhetoric—new racism referring to the idea that “overt \nand obvious (old) racism is in decline but that instead a new form of racism has emerged \nwhere people are obligated to appear non-racist (Billig, 1988) but still hold views that \ndifferent races are not equal” (Goodman, 2017, p. 455). Goodman and Burke (2011) looked \nat the potential of deracialized speech to function as justifications for rejecting asylum \n\t\t\n87 \nseekers on the grounds of economic reasons, religion, and lack of ability to integrate—targets \nthat have “replaced race as a common way of opposing people from different groups” (p. \n459). He goes on to say that: \nThis certainly does not mean that the concept of race has been abandoned altogether; \ninstead, it means that race can be a particularly unpalatable reason for opposing \noutgroups and so when the context requires it, non-racial arguments can be made \nregarding a topic that may appear to have a racial element. (p. 459-460). \n \nWetherell (2003) discusses how discursive psychological studies regarding race talk \ndemonstrate how race/racism is not only denied in deracialized speech, but that it actually \n“sustains and legitimates social inequalities and…injustices” (p. 21). Goodman’s (2017) \ninterpretation of Wetherrell and Potter’s (2002) study about Maori people in New Zealand \n“ultimately showed how the talk about Maori people in New Zealand justified and explains \naway the inequalities between the dominant ‘white’ and the indigenous Maori New \nZealanders in ways that ignored the ongoing impact of the European colonization of the \ncountry” (p. 460). In other studies, discursive deracialization has been grounded in the notion \nof what race “is” and what it “is not.” In internet discussions about Gypsies, Goodman and \nRowe (2014) found that contributors to the forum were explicit that Gypsies do not constitute \na “race,” and therefore, any comments made “could not be attributed to racism” and thus \nfunctions to “further prejudicial ideas about minority groups, once again sustaining social \ninequalities (Wetherell, 2003)” (Goodman, 2015, p. 460). Bertrand (2010) demonstrates how \nderacialized strategies are used to index race using place names. She finds that deracialized \nspeech in Western societies take two forms: positive self-presentation and negative other-\npresentation. She suggests that “these two strategies…allow Whites to reproduce racism \n\t\t\n88 \nwhile avoiding being perceived as racists…support[ing] “new racism,” a blatant variety that \nis characterized by the denial of its existence” (p. 486). \nYet, as these denials of the existence of racism persist, so too evidence of the \npersistence of racism can be seen, as Catherine R. Squires (2014) discusses in The Post-\nRacial Mystique: \nThe gap between the aspirational post-racial discourse and the brutal realities of \npoverty, police profiling, anti-immigration vitriol, and mind-boggling incarceration \nrates for blacks and Latinos/as is wide. Yet the media continue to churn out films and \nshows that feature scores of people of color living discrimination-free lives. \nAdvertisements showcase knowledgeable professionals of all colors happily giving \nadvice or buying products for their middle-class homes—right next door to their \nwhite friends. When someone reports a racist incident on the news, sources scramble \nover each other to deny any racist intent or impact on the event in question. They \npoint to millionaire black athletes, Asian American collegians, and, of course, our \nbiracial president as proof that America is post-racial. (p. 5) \n \nSpecific instances of Squire’s critique are noticeable in Washington’s (2012) analysis \nof media productions of interracial intimacy of TV medical dramas: \nOn first glance, these Black and Asian American interracial relationships on Grey’s \nAnatomy and ER might imply television is changing, race relations are improving, \nand media are in the process of moving forward to a newfound celebration of racial \ndiversity and interracial romantic utopia. However, in analyzing the discourse \nsurrounding the shows, it becomes clear that a “color neutral” standard, one that \nignores race and racism and celebrates the invisibility of racial identity, a standard \nthat has been part of U.S. multicultural racial discourses at least since the racial \npolitics of the film, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967), persists, despite the \nfaçade of racial progress. (p. 257) \n \nSo too, issues surrounding sexual identities have become more visible in the media \nthrough television shows like Will & Grace, the L Word, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, and \nQueer as Folk—not to mention the token placement of gay characters within predominantly \nheterosexual movies and television including Easy A, I Love You Man, and Bridget Jones’s \nDiary. And just as Squire’s notes the tendency of news sources to scramble over ways to \n\t\t\n89 \nerase aspects of race pertaining to reported crimes, instances like the Orlando Pulse massacre \nhighlight the deracialization of the event as notated by Eguchi (2016) in discussing the \nhidden facets of whiteness at play. Additionally, his discussion that despite the fact that \nGLBTQ people have increased visibility in the US, “they are still subjected to discrimination, \npredjudice, and/or violence every day” (p. 164). These issues have become a sore spot for \npeople to legitimize their homophobia through anecdotes, examples, and the erasure of \nexplicitly homophobic language; the following section outlines the conceptualization of \ndiscursive dequeerification and the similarity in strategies to discursive deracialization in \nminimizing the perceived presence of homophobia within discourses. \nDiscursive Dequeerification: A Queer Counterpart \nIn similar fashion to deracialized speech to remove the racialized portion of talk, I \noffer a reading of the Mormon Church’s use of (lie)alectics as a discursive \ndequeerification—an erasure of homophobic elements of talk, replaced with a non-\nhomophobic alternative, and offer a conceptualization of new homophobia—the belief that \novert and obvious homophobia are a thing of the past and thus those still holding onto beliefs \nthat homosexuals are different and inferior to heterosexuals are obligated to appear non-\nhomophobic. I choose the term dequeerification in comparison to something akin to \ndehomophobification because the discourse rejects and/or erases not only sexual identities \nexisting along the homo/hetero binary, but all non-heterosexual identities. In essence, \n(queer)aphobia may be a more accurate representation of the discriminatory ideologies being \nconcealed within the discourse than (homo)phobia. And because this is not an actual erasure \nof the discriminatory ideology—homophobia/(queer)aphobia are still alive and well in \nMormon Church doctrine—but rather a simple discursive removal of queer-related words \n\t\t\n90 \nand phrases from the actual discourse. Therefore, dequeerification is a more accurate \nrepresentation of this discursive strategy than a term focusing on the homo/hetero binary and \nthe ways in which it reinforces heteronormativity. The second goal of this research is to \nprovide a way to assess the implication of (lie)alectics to reinforce heteronormative \nideologies positioning all non-heterosexual identities as at odds with social norms. Here, I \nprovide a discussion of how discursive dequeerification works in a similar fashion regarding \nheteronormativity (i.e., discursive dequeerification reinforces heteronormativity the same \nway discursive deracialization reinforces racism). \nIn similar fashion to the “I’m not a racist, but” disclaimer, so too the “I’m not \nhomophobic, but” disclaimer seems to precede questions like: “What is the current \nacceptable acronym for the LGBTQ-HIJKLMNOP community?”—essentializing the \nLGBTQ community with a sense of super diversity with aims to bait and trap unsuspecting, \nnon-homophobic, heterosexuals into saying something insensitive, discriminatory, and/or \nhomophobic. Which of course, THEY ARE NOT (note sarcasm). After all, how could they \nbe? They have gay friends and family members, would never use the words faggot, dyke, or \nqueer, and have Will & Grace saved to their favorites list on Netflix. As Squires (2014) \naddresses that “while the term ‘post-racial’ was not commonly used in the 1980s and 1990s \n[20 years following the “post-civil rights era”], discussions of the meaning of race—\nparticularly the meaning of black identity—were widespread” (p. 3). Similarly, the \nmomentum and inertia of the “gay rights movement” over the past decade is opening up \nconversations about gay identities as sexual orientation has increasingly been added to anti-\ndiscrimination laws. As such, the more protection the law provides for individuals based on \nsexual identity, the less the LGBTQ community appears to be oppressed and discriminated \n\t\t\n91 \nagainst, and subsequently the more conversations surrounding LGBTQ rights are mimicking \npost-racial rhetoric in its trajectory.  \nFor example, the “let the bigots be bigots” mentality emerges in cases like the \nMasterpiece Cakeshop Supreme Court case discussed in Chapter two, and other similar cases \nacross the US, in which the discourse places the LGBTQ community as needlessly making \nwaves (e.g., If you’re gay, why would you want to buy a cake from a homophobic baker \nanyway? Take your business elsewhere. What they are doing isn’t right, but not giving them \nmoney is the best revenge)—thus representing individuals as not condoning what the \nhomophobic person is doing, but that “bigots will be bigots,” and the world is changing, and \nwe all just have to learn to get along until history catches up. Thus, following a similar time \nline to the civil rights era, notions of a “post-gay rights era” are emerging in the form of \ndiscursively dequeerified speech—even amidst the clear and explicit homophobic rhetoric \nthat persists (and has arguably increased under the current Republican-dominated \nadministration) in political, religious, and cultural discourses. \nFurthering the connections between post-racial and post-queer rhetorics, Squires \n(2014) addresses the role of the Christian Right in maintaining party separation and \nidentifications helping “white Christian media texts try to explain their own histories of racial \nexclusion and racist practices” (p. 69). Similarly, the Mormon and Gay website functions as a \nway for the Mormon Church to “explain” its history of exclusion of gay members and refusal \nto acknowledge gender identities. Additionally, while the Mormon Church subscribes to a \n“Political Neutrality” policy, this policy includes an addendum stating that the church \n“Reserves the right as an institution to address, in a nonpartisan way, issues that it believes \nhave significant community or moral consequences or that directly affect the interests of the \n\t\t\n92 \nChurch” (Newsroom, 2011). In this way, it allows its members to vote according to their \nconscience and beliefs, yet many of those beliefs consistently align along party lines \nsupporting not only homophobic legislation, but racist and sexist marginalizing policies as \nwell—thus, demonstrating the significance of this discourse’s potential influence on public \npolicy. \nIn a similar fashion, in line with the notion that (lie)alectics function to make the \nMormon Church appear non-homophobic—the next section substantiates (lie)alectics as a \nform of discursive dequeerified speech and demonstrates how it functions to justify the \ncontinuation of anti-gay policies in modern-day politics substantiated by the Christian \nRight’s infiltration into party identifications associating Republican party affiliation with \nmoral and Christian values. \n (Lie)alectics as discursively dequeerified speech. As it applies to deracialization, \nGoodman (2017) discusses the paradoxical nature of disclaimers in deracialized speech as \n“otherwise there would be no need to make a denial in the first place” (p. 459). Similarly, the \nMormon Church’s need to create public platforms to make clear that their church policies are \nnon-homophobic is in-and-of-itself indicative of homophobia. So, then why the focus on \n(lie)alectics? Why not simply stop at the presence of the website itself as innately \nhomophobic? Why illuminate the strategy itself? My first justification for a focus on the \nstrategy is due to its divisive, underhanded approach; ignoring the divisiveness of this \nstrategy turns a blind eye to the intensity of continued discrimination against LGBTQ \npeoples in the US. Secondly, in a political climate where politicians subscribing to notions of \nthe Christian Right are actively proposing legislation that would advance anti-gay and \nhomophobic public policies, understanding the strategy being used by those subscribing to \n\t\t\n93 \nnotions of the Christian Right and aligning themselves with these politicians16, can be used in \nactivism to undermine these strategies and reveal their underlying divisive nature (i.e., \ncritical communication scholarship can be used to demonstrate how texts and discourses are \nused to reify heteronormativity to subjugate LGBTQ-identified individuals). Thus, I provide \nthe following overview of how (lie)alectics function as discursively dequeerified speech.  \n In a similar way that disclaimers function as an indicator of race talk ‘I’m not a \nracist, but,’ (lie)alectics use conjunctions in a similar fashion to set up their homophobic \nstatements as subordinated to contradicting information, as in “The attraction itself is not a \nsin, but acting on it is” (Mormon and Gay). In this example, the attraction is not labeled as \nhomosexual or heterosexual but is inferred within the (lie)alectical tension between attraction \nand action, which will be further developed in the analysis chapter. And again, “While one \nmay not have chosen to have these feelings, he or she can commit to keep God’s \ncommandments” (Mormon and Gay). This passage need not define “these feelings” as \nheterosexual or homosexual as the (lie)alectic has already set up homosexual sex acts as at \nodds with God’s commandments AND subordinates homosexuality to God’s law. The \nabsence of defining the feelings as non-heterosexual lends itself to include non-homophobic \ninterpretations (i.e., provides space for alternative non-homophobic explanations of the \ndiscourse). \nEven in the examples where the website uses explicitly sexualized language, the \nstylistic choices in grammar and usage reveal the ways in which the discourse draws \nattention toward the non-homophobic portion of the sentence and deflects attention away \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n16 Of significance, Vice President Mike Pence who is publically supportive of and attends \ncelebratory events in honor of James Dobson, Head of Focus on the Family, a notorious \nConservative Christian and anti-gay organization, and makes public declarations promoting \nconversion therapy. \n\t\t\n94 \nfrom the homophobic content. For example, the use of the terminology of “same-sex \nattraction” allows for a rhetorical maneuver in which the discourse can draw attention toward \nthe sexual behavior, reducing the importance of sexuality as an identity, and thus creating \nspace for homophobic doctrine to appear accepting of same-sex attraction while still being \nrejecting of non-heterosexual behaviors and identities. \nIn summary, these (lie)alectics can be seen as preemptive counterstrikes to perceived \nthreats on dominant ideologies. Pertaining to the particular artifact examined, the Religious \nFreedoms and Nondiscrimination press conference was held exactly three months prior to the \noral arguments made before the Supreme Court of the United States in the Obergefell v. \nHodges case. That is, before this case even went to trial, the Mormon Church attempted to \npreemptively create legislation that would allow PoF the right to discriminate against the \nLGBT community by way of claiming RFs. Thus, this research utilizes this theoretical \nconceptualization of (lie)alectics to uncover the stylistic patterns indicative of discourses \nworking toward the discursive dequeerification of spaces via claims to religious freedoms. \nMethodology \nIn the introductory chapter, I argue that the Mormon Church utilizes stylistic \nmaneuvers to appear inclusive of legislation supporting LGBT rights as a means of \nsubstantiating their claims to RFs. I further developed research goals including: 1) to expose \nunderlying anti-gay ideologies present in the Mormon and Gay website through identification \nof (lie)alectical structures, 2) to provide a way to assess the implications of these structures to \nreinforce heteronormative ideologies to act as preemptive counterstrikes to perceived threats \non dominant religious doctrines regarding LGBT issues, and 3) to extrapolate the potential of \n\t\t\n95 \nsuch discourses to shape state and federal US policies that directly impact the material \nrealities of LGBT-identified individuals. \nTo accomplish the goals of this study, I employ a critical rhetorical approach to the \nanalysis of the Mormon and Gay website, utilizing a proposed theoretical framework based \non (lie)alectics and discursive dequeerification. The remainder of this chapter will: 1) \ncontextualize critical rhetoric and justify its use as methodologically appropriate for this \nanalysis, and 3) outline the specific steps that will be taken to demonstrate what the analysis \nof this research will produce. \nA Critical Rhetorical Approach. The interconnectivity of method and paradigm is \nindisputable; the exact nature of this interconnectedness, however, is by turns an exchange \nabout the relationship between these two constructs themselves. My research is informed by \nthe ontological, epistemological, and axiological assumptions of the critical paradigm. \nOntologically, the critical paradigm subscribes to reality consisting of structural and \nhistorical activities that are transformed through dialectical interactions (Guba & Lincoln, \n1998). Epistemologically, the critical paradigm subscribes to the notion of knowledge as ever \nchanging; that is, knowledge is not simply accumulated, but rather changes as it is informed \nby historical contextualization of that knowledge (Guba & Lincoln, 1998). According to \nGuba & Lincoln, values are central and unavoidable within the critical paradigm; it adopts an \nintrinsic axiology—a “moral tilt toward revelation,” insofar as the paradigm seeks to \nconfront ignorance and misapprehension. With these assumptions in mind, this research calls \nfor a critical rhetorical approach, one that pushes for “a commitment to political change” and \nalso treats all linguistic acts as potentially rhetorical in nature (McKerrow, 1989; Ono & \nSloop, 1992). \n\t\t\n96 \nAs a project of critical examination of dominant heteronormative ideologies, I employ \na critical rhetorical methodology insofar as Critical Rhetoric subscribes to the notion of \nreality consisting of structural and historical activities that can be transformed (Guba & \nLincoln, 1998). I utilize a critical approach to rhetoric because Critical Rhetoric differentiates \nitself from traditional rhetorical approaches as it focuses not only on critique but also on \ntransformation. It focuses not only on the potential influence of discourses, as is the case with \ntraditional rhetoric, but grounds itself in an orientation of praxis—a commitment to political \nchange (Ono & Sloop, 1992). McKerrow (1989) is attributed as one of the first scholars to \npropose a critical approach to rhetoric. Drawing on Foucault, McKerrow frames his approach \nas an orientation toward criticism that is informed by discourses of power as a means of \nmaintaining privilege of the “elite.” He frames this through a critique of domination and \nfreedom suggesting that essentially freedom for one person is domination for another. That \nis, he highlights that power has both a creative and repressive function in relation to each \nother. McKerrow views rhetorical critique as a transformative practice rather than a method, \nwhich recognizes the materiality of discourse. He suggests a movement in rhetorical criticism \ntowards a critique of ideologies, and suggests that ideologies are rhetorical creations.  \nThe goal of Critical Rhetoric is to bring about social and political change through \ndiscourse analysis. Ono & Sloop (1992) advanced an argument for a Critical Rhetoric \ncommitted to a telos—an ultimate purpose to the research itself—a philosophy of action. \nTheir approach critiques traditional rhetoric for its lack of political commitment to affect \nchange, arguing that “self-critical and ‘skeptical’ scholarship is not an end in itself. Such \nwork does not demonstrate, sufficiently, the contingent nature of criticism and its relationship \nto the society in which the critic is a member” (p. 48). A critical rhetorical approach to this \n\t\t\n97 \nresearch is appropriate insofar as Ono & Sloop advance the argument that “Critics have a \nstake in the critical act itself, and therefore should describe their purpose through telos” (p. \n48). They define telos as the “temporary fixing of meaning that admits the political nature of \ncriticism, hence its need to affect change” (p. 48).  \nWithin their discussion, Ono & Sloop (1992) summarize Foucault stating that this is a \nprocess of creating “space, subject positions, in which excluded groups can see themselves \nand be seen by others” (p. 55). They suggest that the job of the rhetorical critic is to allow for \na Foucaultian forward-thinking perspective that promotes above all the critic’s choice of \nsubject matter, discourse, and audience in relation to the reality she or he wishes to create. In \nthis way, Critical Rhetoric is as much about critics’ roles in their own critical beliefs as it is \nas about the method by which a discourse is analyzed. That is, the rhetorical strategies used \nby the critic in talking or writing about their analysis is of equal importance to the rhetorical \nstrategies used in the discourse under examination. In this way, the application of Critical \nRhetoric is further substantiated as appropriate for this research when considering the self-\nreflexive moves I must make as the researcher. That is, having been a member of the \nMormon Church myself for over 28 years, raised within the throws of Mormon doctrines \n(including its positioning on same-sex practices), and “coming out” as a lesbian at the age of \n31, certainly played a role in my “choice of discourse” from a Foucaultian perspective—and \nthat choice, in and of itself, has rhetorical significance that must be accounted for in this \nresearch. A critical rhetorical approach foundationally allows the researcher, in this instance \nme, to navigate the texts I am examining in ways that utilize my “insider” knowledge-base as \nan epistemologically rigorous and valid methodological tool. \n\t\t\n98 \nLastly, following these ontological and epistemological assumptions of the critical \nparadigm regarding the function of language, this research seeks to draw out the \ninterconnecting role of language and social life. Additionally, it focuses on the dialectical \ntensions formed by language to other elements of social life. This situates not only language \nitself as the central tool for analysis, but also the systematic structuring of language as a tool \nof creating reality—in this instance, a dialectical one. Thus, this research focuses on language \nas an indicator of ideology. This methodological approach reveals the ideological \nassumptions present in the Mormon and Gay website and the implications of those ideologies \nto influence public policies regarding LGBT rights. \nMethod \nTextual and Thematic/Cluster Analysis. To accomplish the goals of this research, I  \nutilize textual analysis as the first step of data collection. For the purposes of this research, I \ndefine “text” as any written, printed, or spoken item consisting of verbal language (i.e., \nwords, sentences, etc.). As substantiated in chapter one, I have chosen to examine the \nMormon and Gay website because of Mormonism’s positionality and its potential social \nimpacts. This website includes six main links titled: Home, Stories, Beliefs, Understanding, \nVideos, and About. These pages include written and video testimonials, official declarations \nof church policies, links to documents published on the Mormon Church’s larger \nwww.lds.org website, and links to resources for gay Mormons and parents of gay children. \nThis research is comprehensive and examine all posted material published directly on the \nMormon and Gay website. It do not, however, examine documents linked to (but not directly \npublished) on the Mormon and Gay website. As websites are not static, and information can \n\t\t\n99 \nbe posted or removed at any point in time, I downloaded individual papers and saved them \nbased on the date and time downloaded. \nUsing a printed copy of these downloads, I perform a close reading of the discourse \nposted on the Mormon and Gay website with the express purpose of identifying (lie)alectical \nstructures in the text. Identification of these structures utilizes stylistic indicators17 (i.e., \ngrammar, syntax, sentence structure, textual proximity18 and vocabulary choices19). After \nexamining the stylistic structure of the text, I group the identified stylistic indicators together \nthematically (i.e., categorize patterns in the text that denote or signify (lie)alectical \nstructures). This includes, for example, the consistent use of the transcript’s use of the word \n“advocate” to indicate an “Advocating Dialectic,” as was outlined in the theoretical \nframework section of this chapter. After completing the analysis of the text, I then analyze \nthese (lie)alectical structures and provide implications for how these rhetorical constructs \nreinforce heteronormativity and stand to influence future state and federal legislation that \nwould allow organizations and individuals to discriminate against LGBT-identified \nindividuals on the grounds of Religious Freedoms. \nQueer Theory as Method. As indicated earlier in this chapter, this research treats \n“queer” as a verb—the act of queering spaces. Thus, my textual and thematic/cluster analysis \nis informed by a specific focus on identification of heteronormative ideological assumptions \npresent in the text as a means of queering institutionalized religious spaces. That is, this \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n17 My use of the term stylistic indicator to mean grammar, sentence structure, etc. is not a \nunique treatment of textual analysis. However, I coin and utilize the term stylistic indicator to \ndraw attention to the rhetorical treatment of style to act as a function of language and its \nability to be an indicator of ideology. \n \n18 Specifically, the placement of non-antithetical ideas in close proximity to each other \n\t\n19 Specifically, the use of polarized language. \n\t\t\n100 \nresearch is predicated upon the assumption that heteronormative messages are present within \nthe text, and through the use of textual and thematic/cluster analysis of the discourse, these \nheteronormative ideals will emerge from the discourse providing the dominant ideological \nbackdrop upon which the queering (or act of identifying that which is at odds with the norm) \ncan be performed. \nConclusion \n Overall, (lie)alectics can be seen as both an error in reasoning and a discursive \nstrategy, which obfuscates obvious homophobia, and in some cases, literally removes \nhomophobic phrases and words in entirety from discourses through the process of \ndequeerification. The discussion of discursive deracialization in this chapter functions to \ndemonstrate how discourses can be stripped of explicitly homophobic language in similar \nways; discourses get stripped away of explicit racist language to resist accusations of racism. \nIn addition to the research done on discursive deracialization, I propose (lie)alectics as a \nspecific strategy of discursive dequeerification—one that does not work solely by removing \nhomophobic language from the discourse, but also creates logical fallacies that represent \nthemselves as reason (i.e., comparing non-antithetical ideas as though they were \nincommensurate), making the discourse appear benign in its homophobic trajectory. In the \nexamples provided in this chapter, I substantiate (lie)alectics as a useful theoretical \nframework in understanding how homophobic discourses are resisting labels of homophobia \nand will function to deconstruct the discourse on the Mormon and Gay website. Thus, in the \nnext chapter, I utilize (lie)alectics and dequeerification and theoretical frameworks upon \nwhich my textual analysis of the Mormon and Gay website is predicated. \n \n\t\t\n101 \nCHAPTER 5 \nANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION \nIntroduction \nIn chapter one, I proposed a study that would analyze the Mormon and Gay website \nto examine the way the Mormon Church is utilizing (lie)alectical structures to instruct its \nmembers how to respond to LGBT issues and represent themselves as a non-homophobic \nentity. The Mormon Church historically has altered its doctrines when those beliefs have \nconflicted with federal law.20 However, in this instance, the church is choosing to retain its \nanti-gay policies even in the face of the federal recognition of same-sex marriage in the US. \nTo avoid labels of homophobia and potential legal repercussions for refusal to acknowledge a \nprotected class, the Mormon Church must establish their anti-gay policies as also protected \nby federal law, which they have attempted to do in press conferences (such as the one \ndiscussed in Chapter four). Analysis of Mormon discourses aimed at the public has \ndemonstrated how the Mormon Church has used these (lie)alectical structures as a \npreemptive counterstrike to these perceived threats. However, the church is faced with \nanother problem in maintaining their anti-gay policies. \nAs the national climate continues to shift towards the recognition of homophobia as \npervasive and problematic, the church has experienced resistance from its own members \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n20 Recall that in 1890, the Mormon Church abandoned its practice of polygamy when the \nfederal government threatened to disenfranchise the church if they continued to practice \nplural marriage. And again, in 1978, the church changed its policy on African American men \nallowing them to be anointed into the church’s priesthood. \n \n  \n\t\t\n102 \ntoward its anti-gay policies.21 As such, the church is met with a second challenge; to avoid \nlosing membership due to its homophobic doctrines, the church must also provide a way for \nits members to make sense of the true dialectic that one cannot be Mormon and engage in \nsame-sex practices. That is, it must represent its anti-gay policies as non-homophobic. Thus, \nthis analysis examines how the church utilizes (lie)alectical structures on its published \nwebsite Mormon and Gay to represent their anti-gay policies as non-homophobic in nature. \nThis accomplishes three things: 1) It normalizes homophobic beliefs as natural and justified, \n2) gives its members a way to negotiate their own dissonance when faced with their own \nfeelings of same-sex attraction and/or the same-sex attraction experienced by others \n(especially family members), and 3) gives its members a way to talk about same-sex \nattraction with others without appearing homophobic. \n To engage this study, I performed a close reading of the Mormon and Gay website \nlooking for (lie)alectical structures present in the text and analyzed their function. Two \n(lie)alectical themes emerged from this analysis: 1) Being v. Fleeting, and 2) Attraction v. \nAction. These themes were identified using the rhetorical canons of arrangement and style, \nincluding choices in textual proximity (arrangement), as well as language and grammatical \nchoices (style). Below, I provide a justification for using arrangement and style as measures \nin the identification process of (lie)alectics. Second, I outline the identified (lie)alectics and \nprovide textual examples to substantiate their presence in the text. \nArrangement and Style \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n21 On April 4, 2015, an estimated 50 members of the Mormon Church stood during the 186th \nAnnual General Conference and publicly shouted “opposed” to sustaining the top Mormon \nleaders in response to the church’s stance on same-sex marriage; In November 2015, \napproximately 1,500 members of the Mormon Church congregated at LDS Headquarters \nresigning from the church in protest of new church policy banning children of same-sex \ncouples from being baptized or blessed. \n\t\t\n103 \n The five canons of rhetoric have been and continue to be a cornerstone of many \nrhetorical studies. The canons themselves are tools in both the production and analysis of \nrhetorical discourse. That is, by the very nature of discourse, authors/producers must use \nelements of both arrangement (organizational choices) and style (language and grammar \nchoices), because these canons are built into the core structure of language use. They also \nfunction as tools to deconstruct texts, which allows rhetorical scholars to draw conclusions \nabout an author’s/producer’s intentions based on the assumption that language users make \nchoices, and those choices can be interpreted to have intentionality. That is, this approach to \nrhetorical analysis assumes that the discourse aims to accomplish something and that the \nlanguage choices of the author/producer of a text are evidence of that intentionality. As \nSolomon (1978) suggests: \nModern sociolinguistics, in contrast, concentrates on the social implications of \nstylistic variation. From this viewpoint, style—in the sense of choices about dictation, \nsyntax, tone, and even content—is an important ingredient in discourse of all levels, \nand stylistic variation is crucial in signaling, maintaining, and changing the social \nrelationships which exist between participants. Each individual possesses a linguistic \nrepertoire from which to choose the level of style best suited to a particular situation. \n(p. 173-174). \n \nI would add grammar to Solomon’s list of facets constituting style. While not every instance \nof word choice, grammar, and organization are intentional on the part of the author/producer \n(or indicative of (lie)alectics), the patterns within a text (e.g., a tendency toward using \npassive voice) can be seen as an unintentional/intentional use of style and arrangement, but \nwith an intentional goal (i.e., avoidance of taking responsibilities as in “mistakes were \nmade”). In this way, I use elements of style and arrangement as indicators of a larger strategy \nat work in the text (i.e., (lie)alectics).  \nGrammar and Dialectics / (Lie)alectics \n\t\t\n104 \nGrammar is an important function in analyzing the stylistic choices present in a text, \nbecause elements of grammar have specific purposes and functions in meaning making. That \nis, nouns function to identify (persons, places, and things), adjectives function to describe, \netc. Thus, sentence set up, language choice, and the order of those language choices govern, \nto an extent, how the reader interprets the meaning of the message. This analysis focuses in \non two specific grammatical elements in the text that denote (lie)alectics: Conjunctions and \nadverbs. \nConjunctions. When examining a text for the presence of dialectics/(lie)alectics, it is \nimportant to examine the way a text uses conjunctions, because conjunctions determine the \nrelationship between two or more ideas, and are thus revealing of what information the \nauthor/producer wants to draw attention to and what information the author/producer wants \nto draw attention away from—and that is because conjunctions come in two forms: \ncoordinating and subordinating. Coordinating conjunctions are placed between sentences or \nclauses of equal rank or equal emphasis (e.g., Sam is taking algebra and Spanish). In this \nexample, algebra and Spanish are equally emphasized and could be rearranged \ninterchangeably with each other. Coordinating conjunctions include: for, and, nor, but, or, \nyet, and so. Subordinating conjunctions are designed to emphasis the main clause over the \nsubordinate clause (e.g., The store was fully stocked, because it had just received a \nshipment). In this example, “because it had just received a shipment” is subordinated because \nthe focus of the sentence is the fact that “The store was fully stocked,” as evidenced by the \nfact that one could not rearrange the sentence to say “The store had just received a shipment, \nbecause it was fully stocked.” The meaning is changed when the clauses are rearranged. \nWhile there is an exhaustive list of coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions are \n\t\t\n105 \nfewer. Examples of subordinating conjunctions include, but are not limited to: after, \nalthough, as, because, if, inasmuch, just, rather, since, though, whereas, while, until, etc. \nAdverbs. An additional grammatical element that is significantly prominent in the \ntext as an indicator of (lie)alectics is adverbs. Adverbs are words or phrases that modify or \nqualify a verb, adjective, or another adverb—similar to the way an adjective modifies or \nqualifies a noun. Examples of adverbs include: Before, after, already, nevertheless, some, \nsometimes, mostly, always, etc. Adverbs are a significant indicator of (lie)alectics in the texts \non the Mormon and Gay website because they are most often used to contradict previously \nstated material. For example, in the article Love One Another: A Discussion on Same-Sex \nAttraction, published on the Mormon and Gay website, it states: “Everyone experiences the \ndesperation of temptation and the emptiness of sin. This is the common condition of \nhumankind. Nevertheless, Latter-day Saints believe that the ‘good news’ of Jesus Christ \nshows that these adversities are not final. They are part of the test of mortality that all people \nundergo.” This passage attempts to unite members of the Mormon Church as having a \ncommon purpose with all of humanity. It then goes on to differentiate Latter-day Saints from \nnon-Mormons. While not stated explicitly, because this article is published on the Mormon \nand Gay website, it can be inferred that the word “adversities” is a referent to “same-sex \nattraction.” In this way, this example demonstrates how the discourse utilizes adverbs to both \nunite and separate members of the Mormon Church as accepting of LGBT individuals, yet \nalso sets itself aside as accessing higher truth that is not available to those who do not \nsubscribe to Mormon doctrine’s take on the atonement of Jesus Christ.  \n Qualifiers. One particular type of adverb is called a qualifier. Qualifiers are typically \nadverbs (although sometimes adjectives) that function specifically to attribute a quality to \n\t\t\n106 \nanother word, usually a noun. In the case of the Mormon and Gay website, it is important to \nnote that with little exception, the word “gay” is used as a qualifier, not a noun. That is, \nsentences such as “Josh is a gay Mormon,” are common, whereas sentences such as “Some \nwomen may also use the term gay to describe themselves,” are rare. When qualifiers are \nnouns, and not adverbs, they are often used to denote specificity regarding the abnormal (i.e., \nmale nurse, lady doctor, foreign student, etc.). As such, using the word “gay” as a qualifier is \nindicative of the presence of (lie)alectics insofar as it denotes the presence of the \nincommensurate nature of the words “gay” and “Mormon.” That is, it substantiates gayness \nas at-odds with Mormonism insofar as the qualifier is necessary to separate out “gay \nMormons” from “straight Mormons,” …or just Mormons. \nUnpacking the (Lie)alectics \nIf one experiences same-sex attraction, he or she can choose whether to use a sexual \nidentity label. Identifying oneself as gay or lesbian is not against Church policy or \ndoctrine; however, it may have undesired consequences in the way one is treated. \n- Mormon and Gay, 2017  \n \nBeginning with my own personal experience of negotiating my gay identity while \nremaining active in the Mormon Church for nearly 30 years, this section maps out the \n(lie)alectics present in the discourse on the Mormon and Gay website and outlines what the \ndiscourse aims to accomplish. Although I can now trace back my attraction to other women \nas beginning as young as seven or eight years old, the first time I can remember mentally \nasking myself if I might be gay, I was 16-years-old, tormented by an unmistakable giddiness \nof sexual attraction at complete odds with my internalized notions of goodness and \nrighteousness—and thus masquerading as deep friendship and/or sisterly-type love, as there \nwas no other framework for interpretation of my experience at that time. In fact, \n\t\t\n107 \nretrospectively, I felt like a sinner just for experiencing an increased heart rate at the sight of \nthe best friend (i.e., secret crush). Rationalization aside, I knew what I was feeling was \n“wrong” and that to disclose such a wrongness might leave me vulnerable to shaming, public \nridicule, and possible excommunication from the church that governed my understanding of \nreality. Indeed, there was no official church policy in 1998 that protected me from \nexcommunication were I to discuss my sexuality with a church leader.  \nThe “Born This Way” notion was at the cornerstone of Mormon doctrine’s rejection \nof homosexuality, suggesting that there were root causes for homosexuality (i.e., \npornography, masturbation, and sexual abuse), rejecting the notion that people could be born \nwith biological facets of identity as gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, etc. Thus, choosing a sexual \nidentity label was not an option—nor was voicing the attractions I was experiencing. I felt \nbeyond isolated; I felt a sense of silent desperation, unable to speak my truth yet unable to \nescape the ideological framework that defined my very existence as \nunacceptable/unwelcome/unwanted and at complete odds with church doctrines. The church \nwhich claimed to be my salvation provided me with no framework to negotiate my sexual \nidentity. Likewise, many people in the Mormon faith have been left in this same space—a \ngrowing space creating exigency within the church to provide a framework for individuals to \nmake sense of their sexual identities in a way where they can remain members of the church \nwhile still experiencing this type of attraction. The following (lie)alectics are examples of \nhow the Mormon Church is attempting to do this in line with this analysis’ assertion of what \nthe discourse accomplishes. \nThe Role of Agency within (Lie)alectics \n\t\t\n108 \n Agency largely drives the (lie)alectics in this discourse. Agency is defined by the \nMormon Church as “the ability and privilege God gives us to choose and to act for \nourselves” (lds.org). Also within Mormon doctrine, the spirit is endowed with moral agency \nbut cannot “act” (i.e., agency/choice is rooted in the body). The body is the vehicle by which \nthe spirit is able to enact its will and desires, etc. The body is viewed as the root of all \nevil/temptation commonly referred to as “the natural man” in Mormon vernacular, stemming \nfrom a verse in the Book of Mormon: “For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been \nfrom the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the \nHoly Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of \nChrist the Lord” (Mosiah 3:19). This correlation between agency and the body is important \nto understanding the ideological assumptions underpinning the (lie)alectics that emerged \nfrom the discourse.  \nThis is important because the (lie)alectics are largely governed by what the Mormon \nChurch is defining as what we have agency over and what we don’t. For example, the \ndiscourse represents the nature of existence as beyond our control (i.e., we are all children of \nGod, whether or not we accept this truth or not; we all existed spiritually before we were \nborn, and we will all die and be resurrected)—no agency. Yet, sexuality (being rooted in the \nbody) is something we can choose to act on or not act on—agency. As will be demonstrated \nin the following (lie)alectics, the discourse utilizes these notions of agency to create a \nconstellation of beliefs that, when taken together, allow the Mormon Church to have gay \nmembers without changing its doctrine regarding homosexuality. It accomplishes this by 1) \ndefining identity as Eternal in nature with overlapping Fleeting identities grounded in the \nbody only and that will no longer exist when the body and spirit are separated, and 2) shifting \n\t\t\n109 \nthe responsibility of homosexuality to the individual by creating a conflict between the \nAttraction itself and the agency of the individual to Act upon his/her sexual impulses. \nBeing Verses Fleeting: Straightening Out Intersectionality \n The first (lie)alectic that emerged from the discourse is a tension regarding identity, \nwhich I am calling Being v Fleeting. Historically, the Mormon Church has treated \nhomosexuality, not as an identity, but as an affliction—something outside of the \nindividual/being itself—a susceptibility of the body, but never an actual component of the \nindividual/being itself. However, as both state and federal laws have increasingly added \nsexual orientation and sexual identity to their lists of protected classes, discourses resisting \ntreatment of sexual identity as an identity have been challenged, including the Mormon \nChurch. Essentially, the purpose of this (lie)alectic is to provide the Mormon Church with a \nway to acknowledge the existence of homosexual identities, while simultaneously preserving \nthose identities as at odds with Mormon Church doctrine (i.e., homosexuality exists, but it \nexists as a part of the body and is therefore not eternal in nature). Here, the primary \nexistential dialectic (Being à Becoming ß Nothing) comes into play. \nIn this dialectic, originally proposed by Hegel, either something exists or it does not. \nYet, the conceptualization of Becoming simultaneously cancels out both Being and Nothing, \nbut it also preserves them insofar as the very definition of Becoming relies on the previous \nconceptions for its own definition. The very nature of this dialectic is in conflict with \nMormonism’s historical treatment of sexual orientation and identity (i.e., either sexual \norientation and identity exist or they don’t). That is, historically, the church has placed sexual \norientation and identity as synonymous with Nothing, simply denying their existence beyond \na feeling or impulse. However, this maneuver is increasingly difficult to uphold in the \n\t\t\n110 \nemergence of sexual orientation and identity being recognized as not only an identity, but a \nprotected identity. To adapt, the discourse represents Being as the dialectical opposite of \nFleeting. As already substantiated, the true dialectical opposite of Being is Nothing, not \nFleeting. And the dialectical opposite of Fleeting is Eternal, not Being. By crossing these \ntwo dialectics, a relationship between Being and Eternal is established, and a relationship \nbetween Nothing and Fleeting is established. Table 4 provides an overview of how the \ntransference of the true dialectic becomes (lie)alectical in nature. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\n111 \nIn this (lie)alectic, Being and Nothing are both states-of-being determining existence \n(i.e., either something exists or it doesn’t). And Eternal and Fleeting are incommensurate \nadjectives that describe the nature of existence (i.e., either something is temporary or it is \npermanent in its existence). The (lie)alectical switch to Being v Fleeting creates a relationship \nbetween Being and Eternal that suggests that existence is never-ending—a fundamental \nbelief of the Mormon Church—and provides a way for the Mormon Church to dictate what \nthe nature of that Eternal state of Being is: a child of God. \nThis (lie)alectic gets at the very nature of Being, and by defining Being as a state-of-\nbeing characterized as Eternal and thus dialectically at odds with any Fleeting identities, this \n(lie)alectic allows for homosexuality to be grouped together with an entire host of Fleeting \nidentities (i.e., old/young, fat/skinny, hairy/bald, even-tempered/short-fused, beautiful/ugly, \netc.)—primarily rooted in the body—and thus no more despised or rejected than any other \nfacet of identity that might22 be at odds with the eternal identity as a “child of God.” This is \nevidenced by the text: \nIn our mortal lives, we may be given or assign ourselves many labels. Some labels \nmay describe affiliations or a stage of life, and other labels may reflect physical \ncharacteristics like tall, short, brunette, bald, or redheaded…Throughout our lives \nour identities change. We inevitably change from young to old. Our views may \nchange, and with those views, we may change our affiliations. (Who Am I?) \n \nOne day, at the end of this short mortal journey, we will return to the presence of our \nHeavenly Parents. One day, all other labels will be swallowed up in our eternal \nidentity as children of God. (Who Am I?) \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n22 Recall that Mormonism allows for change in its doctrine through prophetic revelation. \nReturning to two key examples: 1) Before 1978, being black was incommensurate with \nmembership in the church and now it’s not, and 2) Before 1890, it was perfectly acceptable \nto identify as a polygamist, and now it is grounds for excommunication from the Mormon \nChurch. These examples demonstrate how any facet of identity can be deemed at odds with \nMormon Doctrine. \n\t\t\n112 \n In these examples, the speech is dequeerified by nesting homosexuality amidst a list \nof physical characteristics that commonly shift over time—without explicitly cataloguing \nsame-sex attraction within the list—reducing the visibility of the homophobia by \nrepresenting homosexuality as a facet of identity that can be labeled and avowed, but ONLY \nIF it is treated as a Fleeting identity. The dequeerified portion of the speech is also obvious \nwhen considering the fact that none of the other mentioned facets of identities pointed to in \nthe discourse (i.e., hair color, height, etc.) are at odds with Mormon doctrine, and thus \ncreating the illusion that Mormonism’s stance on sexual identities is not homophobic in \nnature, but rather a rejection of any Fleeting identity that is at odds with the Eternal nature of \nthe soul. This treatment can be seen in several other examples from the discourse discussing \nlabels: \nThe ultimate defining fact for all of us is that we are children of Heavenly Parents, \nborn on this earth for a purpose, and born with a divine destiny. Whenever any of \nthose other notions, whatever they may be, gets in the way of that ultimate defining \nfact, then it is destructive and it leads us down the wrong path (Who Am I?) \n \nWe should exercise care in how we label ourselves. Labels can affect how we think \nabout ourselves and how others treat us and may expand or limit our ability to follow \nGod’s plan for our happiness. If labels get in the way of our eternal progress, we can \nchoose to change them. (Who Am I?) \n \n In these examples, subordinating conjunctions are used to direct the attention of the \nreader toward the Eternal component of the sentence and away from the Fleeting. That is, it \nstates clearly that we are “children of Heavenly Parents,” and then follows this sentence with \nthe dequeerified portion of the speech, subordinating Fleeting identities “whatever they may \nbe” to the stated Eternal identity. Additionally, this allows the discourse to get around \nexplicitly stating that homosexuality or same-sex attraction is at odds with Mormon doctrine; \nrather, it is one of many other identities that could be at odds with Mormonism, but aren’t. In \n\t\t\n113 \nthe second example, the text uses another subordinating conjunction to create a sense of \nconditionality that provides a way for the individual experiencing same-sex attraction to \navoid the previously stated consequences (i.e., we’re not saying you can’t take on a sexual \nidentity label, but if you do, you may be treated differently and stunt your eternal \nprogression, and therefore you can always choose—have the agency—to not take on a sexual \nidentity label). \n To reiterate, in these examples, the text does not make any specific reference to \nsexual identities, but rather uses several examples of temporary characteristics and categories \nthat change over time, implicitly inferring sexuality functions in the same manner, and as \nsuch, the ways we label ourselves may be accurate in one moment and not another—that \nsexual identities are not immutable. This is another way that the church is able to allow its \nmembers to take on an identity label while simultaneously rejecting the notion that sexuality \nis an inherent part of identity—rather simply a label that may or may not apply at different \npoints in time toward a predestined future. In this same article, the discourse goes on to say: \nIf one experiences same-sex attraction, he or she can choose whether to use a sexual \nidentity label. Identifying oneself as gay or lesbian is not against Church policy or \ndoctrine; however, it may have undesired consequences in the way one is treated. \n(Who Am I?) \n \n Here, the church explicitly states that its members can identify as gay or lesbian, but \nthen goes on to subordinate this “agency” to choose a sexual identity with a direct threat that \nmembers who do so “may have undesired consequences.”  And these consequences are \nscattered throughout the narratives on the Stories page. Laurie shares her experience that, “I \ndo get treated differently sometimes, even avoided or shunned by a few” (Laurie’s Story), \nand Josh explains that, “Trying to live a single, celibate life as a gay member in the Mormon \nChurch is difficult. There are sacrifices made, lonely nights felt, and sorrow that the eye \n\t\t\n114 \ncannot see” (Josh’s Story). Ricardo recounts his experience with the undesired consequences \nof labeling his sexual identity: “Embracing [my attraction to men] might be difficult for some \nMormons to understand. It can seem as if by embracing my same-sex attraction, I am \nbreaking a commandment” (Ricardo’s Story). Tonya recounts her experience when her son \nAndy came out to her as gay and the ambiguity and discomfort she felt around her son \nchoosing to take an identity label: \nRegardless of the fact that my love for Andy didn’t change after he told me, I still felt \nlike the rug had been pulled out from under me spiritually. I had a lot of questions \nand a lot of fears….During his mission he experienced deep depression and severe \nanxiety. As part of the process of healing from mental illness, Andy decided he would \nlike to be able to live more authentically and identify openly as a gay Mormon. Dylan \nand I asked that Andy wait to tell others until we could share his experiences with \nfamily members, which he graciously agreed to. The prospect of telling his siblings \nfilled us with concern. (Tonya’s Story) \n \nTonya’s discomfort with her son’s sexuality demonstrates that these “undesired \nconsequences” of using gay labels in the Mormon Church occur at many different levels—\ninside and outside of familial relationships. Similarly, Becky tells her story of struggling to \naccept her son’s sexual identity stating: “When Xian said to me, ‘Mom, I don’t know what \nmy future is, but marrying a girl does not seem possible,’ it was tough to hear…I admit it \ntook me a while to truly understand what ‘unconditional love’ meant. I confused ‘loving’ \nwith ‘condoning.’” (Becky’s Story). Becky’s experience with her son’s sexuality \ndemonstrates a lingering “undesired consequence,” insofar as she continues to reject her \nson’s choice to engage his sexuality despite her sentiments of love for him. Overall, these \nexamples show the “undesired consequences” experienced by members (and their families) \nwho decide to openly identify and take on a label as gay. These examples of lived \nexperiences of gay Mormons demonstrates the ways in which the (lie)alectical tensions \nbetween Being v Fleeting are materialized—states of interpersonal conflict, ambiguity, \n\t\t\n115 \nshunning, isolation, and loneliness. Yet, their stories reach back into the (lie)alectic through \ninternalized homophobia in an acceptance of their sexual identities as Fleeting. For example, \nRicardo describes his experiencing as being “happy to know in my heart that my SSA does \nnot define me as a person or as a son of God” (Ricardo’s Story). Laurie describes her \nstruggles with her sexuality as a blessing, stating: \nMy faith is more seasoned now. I depend on the Lord in all things and have grown to \ntrust that somehow, someway, all of this truly is giving us experience. Even though \nthe very jaws of hell have seemed to gape open wide after me, at several times \nthroughout my life, I do have a perfect knowledge that it is for my good (see D&C \n122:7). (Laurie’s Story) \n \n Her account demonstrates how members of the Mormon Church are incorporating the \nBeing v Fleeting (lie)alectic in her conceptualization of her experience as a progression that \nwill “somehow, someway” eventually lead to a resolution of her internal conflict between her \nsexuality and her religion. Tonya’s story reinforces this even more: \nOne of the greatest gifts I received during that season of my life was the ability to live \nwith, for lack of a better term, spiritual ambiguity. I don’t have all the answers to \nspiritual questions that surround same-sex attraction. I want answers, but I can’t \nhave them now. Reaching that point, where my faith was not troubled by ambiguity, \nwas essential to finding the peace I needed. (Tonya’s Story) \n \n In Tonya’s story, she discusses in great detail her struggle with the ambiguity of her \nson’s sexuality that was in complete conflict with her faith. Her negotiation of this as not \nbeing able to have the answers “now” is indicative of the Eternal portion of the (lie)alectic \n(i.e., she may not have all the answers now but expects to understand the complexities of her \nson’s sexuality at some point in the future). This negotiation allows members of the Mormon \nChurch to accept their ambiguity surrounding sexual identities, and allows the Mormon \nChurch to appear accepting of multiple sexual orientations and identities, when in reality, as \n\t\t\n116 \nhas been shown, the way in which it pairs and subordinates Fleeting identities to the notion \nof Being a “child of God,” demonstrates the ever-present rejection of sexual identities as \nidentities. \nAgain, this is a way for the Mormon Church to preemptively position themselves as \nnon-homophobic by representing themselves as accepting of gay identities and individuals \n(in the here and now) while simultaneously maintaining their anti-gay ideologies that \nultimately reject any non-heterosexual identity as a permanent facet of Being. Additional \nexamples from the text directly support these claims: \n \nOur identity may be in flux, but there is one aspect of who we are that is eternally \nfixed. We will always be children of God. (Who Am I?) \n \nHow you define yourself may change throughout your life, but first and most \nimportant, you are a beloved child of God. (Who Am I?) \n  \nIn these two examples, I hone in on the use of “to be” verbs in these statements in \naddition to the use of the “but” subordinating conjunction to further substantiate the claim \nthat by the nature of (lie)alectics, the crossing of these two concepts creates a relationship \nbetween Being and Eternal. “To be” verbs are used to denote existence of a person or thing. \nSpecifically, they are used to denote the discourse’s treatment of the essence of Being as \nsynonymous with the conceptualization of “child of God.” That is, the text assumes that in \norder to be at all, one must necessarily be a “child of God,” and then uses the subordinating \nconjunction “but” to minimize all other facets of identity to this one governing, primary \nidentity. Thus, by suggesting that “Our identity may be in flux” and following it with a “but,” \ndenotes that any part of an identity that is “in flux” or changeable is lower in rank or \nimportance than the “eternally fixed” identity as a “child of God.” This kind of ranking of \n\t\t\n117 \nidentities allows for an acceptance of identities other than “child of God,” while \nsimultaneously cancelling out the centrality of those other identities. Again, no specific \nreference to sexual orientation or identity is made, and thus, these examples demonstrate the \nerasure of explicitly homophobic language. \nIn other examples, the discourse explicitly uses terms such as same-sex attraction, \ngay, and lesbian in their discussion of labels, but in ways that still constitute dequeerified \nspeech: \nSexual orientation may refer to emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction as well as a \nsense of identity. For some, it is helpful to distinguish between sexual attraction, \nemotional attraction, and identity, rather than grouping them all together as “sexual \norientation.” (About Sexual Orientation) \n \nSame-sex attraction (SSA) refers to emotional, physical, romantic, or sexual \nattraction to a person of the same gender. If you experience same-sex attraction, you \nmay or may not choose to use a sexual orientation label to describe yourself. Either \nway, same-sex attraction is a technical term describing the experience without \nimposing a label. This website uses this term to be inclusive of people who are not \ncomfortable using a label, not to deny the existence of a gay, lesbian, or bisexual \nidentity. (Frequently Asked Questions) \n \n…some who experience same-sex attraction choose not to use a label to describe \nthemselves. How people choose to identify may change over time. Attraction is not \nidentity…There are active Church members who experience same-sex attraction and \nnever choose to identify themselves using a label. Our primary identity will always be \nas a child of God. (About Sexual Orientation). \n \nWords mean different things to different people, and the definition of a word can \nchange throughout our lives. What does the word gay mean to you? Is it a feeling? an \nidentity? a lifestyle? The usage of the word gay has been changing as society and \nculture change. Identifying as gay may mean you experience same-sex attraction but \nchoose not to act on these feelings. Or maybe this label describes how you express \nyourself emotionally, physically, sexually, or politically. (Frequently Asked \nQuestions). \n \n In these examples, the explicit use of the terms same-sex attraction, gay, lesbian, and \nbisexual are utilized to draw attention to the ways these concepts are at odds with Mormon \ndoctrine regarding gender, sexual orientation, and identity. Again, utilizing conjunctions and \n\t\t\n118 \nadverbs, attraction is separated out from identity in a way that allows the Mormon Church to \nappear accepting of gay identities while simultaneously either subordinating or modifying \nnon-heterosexual identities. \n In the first example, all types of sexual attraction are grouped together and using the \nadverbial phrase “as well as,” separates off identity as unrelated to attraction. This \ndemonstrates the church’s treatment of identity as something it is willing to acknowledge but \nthen goes on to state its true position is that there is a distinction between attraction, and \nsexual orientation and identity. Utilizing the adverb “rather,” modifies the first part of the \nsentence “it is helpful to distinguish between sexual attraction, emotional attraction, and \nidentity,” reducing its importance to the idea of “grouping them all together” as problematic. \n Both the second and third examples function to highlight the church’s acceptance of \nits members choosing to take on an identity label while deflecting its underlying \nencouragement of its members to not do so despite the fact that they “can” (have agency to) \nunder new church doctrine. In the second example, the conditional conjunction “if” is used to \ndenote the specificity of audience—those experiencing same-sex attraction—to amplify the \nappearance of the church’s acceptance of sexual identity, by allowing their members to \nchoose an identity label if they want to. It then goes on to subordinate this appearance of \nacceptance using the subordinating conjunction “either way” to define what they really mean \nby same-sex attraction “a technical term describing the experience without imposing a label.” \nLastly, it then uses the adverb “not” to reinforce the stance that the church does not deny the \nexistence of sexual identity as a means of modifying the main content of the website with an \nassentation that any identity other than “child of God” is insignificant and Fleeting.  \n\t\t\n119 \nIn the third example, the discourse clearly states “Attraction is not identity,” which \nexplicitly supports the analysis of the first example, which separates off sexual identity from \nall other forms of sexual attraction. It further utilizes the adverbs “never” and “always” to \ndenote the sense of permanence between Being and “child of God,” conflicting with the \nFleeting problem of negotiating whether or not to label an identity that will eventually no \nlonger be in conflict with the essence of Being. Taken together, these elements point to one \nof the aforementioned functions of the website to provide members of the Mormon Church \nwith ways to negotiate their own dissonance with their non-heterosexual identities. \nAdditionally, it gives members of the church a way to talk about same-sex attraction with \nothers without appearing homophobic, because it allows members to represent themselves as \nnon-homophobic even though they belong to a church that has historically represented itself \nat odds with homosexuality in entirety. \n In the last example, the discourse focuses on the nature of change, drawing attention \nto the Fleeting portion of the (lie)alectic (i.e., what is today may not be tomorrow), and \nnarrows in on the way that terminology surrounding gay identities has changed with “society \nand culture,” lending itself to the notion that it is not church doctrine that is changing by \nrecognizing sexual identity, but rather that society has changed its treatment of sexual \nidentities in such a way that the Mormon Church can now acknowledge sexual identity as an \nidentity without compromising its perceived integrity of its doctrines regarding homosexual \npractices. Furthermore, this speaks to Mormon Church doctrine pertaining to social change. \nMembers of the Mormon Church are taught that, “We are living in an evil and wicked world. \nBut while we are in the world, we are not of the world. We are expected to overcome the \nworld and to live as becometh saints. … We have greater light than the world has, and the \n\t\t\n120 \nLord expects more of us than he does of them” (Teaching of the Mormon Church, 2013, \nn.p.). Putting the last example from the website in context of Mormonism’s belief that its \nmembers are living in a wicked world that they must not be a part of, highlights even more \nthe Being v Fleeting (lie)alectic. That is, experiencing same-sex attraction is a part of Being \nin the world, and as the world changes (and its treatment of sexual identities), Mormons must \nfind new ways of Being in the world, but not of the world. The Being v Fleeting (lie)alectic \nprovides Mormonism with a way to function within the shift in society’s treatment of sexual \norientation and identity being added to anti-discrimination laws, without having to alter its \ndoctrines regarding the nature of Being a “child of God” that conflicts with its notions of \nsexuality, as well as its differentiation between attraction and identity. In accordance with the \nargument that these (lie)alectics normalize homophobic beliefs as natural and justified, this \ntreatment allows members of the church to accept the Mormon Church’s change in doctrine \nallowing members to take on a sexual identity without altering their entire belief system \nabout homosexuality as normal and justifiable, and a way to discuss their homophobic beliefs \nin ways that represent their religious beliefs as not in conflict with sexual identities. To make \nthis whole maneuver possible, the second identified (lie)alectic provides the means by which \nthose who avow homosexual identities can remain members of the Mormon Church and \nabide by its homophobic doctrine (i.e., by restraining their agency). \nAttraction Verses Action: Restrictions of Agency in Gay Mormon Identities \n The second (lie)alectic, which I have titled Attraction v. Action examines the ways in \nwhich the Mormon Church is attempting to negotiate their rejection of homosexuality \nwithout having to acknowledge their homophobia. In this (lie)alectic, the church represents \nAttraction as the dialectical opposite of Action, when in reality, the dialectical opposite of \n\t\t\n121 \nAttraction is Repulsion and the dialectical opposite of Action is Inaction. Table 5 \ndemonstrates how crossing these two dialectics creates a relationship between these two \nconcepts and leads to a (lie)alectical tension and demonstrates how this process leads to \ndequeerified speech.   \n \n \n \nIn the true dialectic, both Attraction and Repulsion are states-of-being characterized \nby movement: movement toward something (attraction) or movement away from something \n(repulsion). Thus, the dialectical sublimation of these concepts would be to be pulled in both \n\t\t\n122 \ndirections (ambivalence). Yet, claiming a state of “ambivalence” to LGBTQ issues would \nundermine the church’s strict anti-gay policies. Nor can church members occupy the clearly \nhomophobic space of Repulsion. By cross canceling these two dialectics \n(Attraction/Repulsion, Action/Inaction), the discourse creates a relationship between \nAttraction and Inaction as commensurate with one another, and thus places Action as \ndialectically in tension Attraction insofar as Attraction is aligned with Action’s dialectical \nopposite Inaction. And the indicator that something is (lie)alectical in nature is the fact that \nno synthesis is required between Attraction and Action, because these are not true dialectical \nopposites. This accomplishes two things. First, it provides a way for those \nexperiencing/encountering same-sex attraction to not have to occupy the space of repulsion \nin order to remain a member of the church. Secondly, this is an enactment of dequeerified \nspeech when looking at the other side of the (lie)alectic that equates Repulsion as \ncommensurate with Action. That is, when looking at this side of the (lie)alectic, the \ncorrelation between Repulsion and Action reveals the true underlying ideological \nassumptions of the discourse: The Mormon Church is repulsed by homosexuality. This \ntreatment of Attraction as the dialectical opposite of Action can be seen in the discourse \nthrough the grammatical indicators covered earlier in this chapter. The following three \nexamples come from the Self-Mastery and Sexual Expression article published under the \nUnderstanding page on the Mormon and Gay website. \nSexuality is an important part of being human and is also a source of passions that \nneed to be bridled. Despite these intense feelings, there are Latter-day Saints who \nfaithfully adhere to the Lord’s moral law over many years. \n \nWithin the context of marriage between a man and a woman, sexual expression is an \nimportant aspect of bonding between spouses. However, if we express ourselves \nsexually outside the bounds the Lord has set, we not only jeopardize our ability to \nchoose well; we also reject the pattern the Lord set for our eternal happiness. \n\t\t\n123 \n  \nThe power to create mortal life is the most exalted power God has given his children. \nIts use was mandated in the first commandment, but another important commandment \nwas given to forbid its misuse. \n  \nIn these examples, the use of conjunctions and adverbs work to pair messages of \nattraction and action and act as indicators of dialectical comparisons. In the first example, \nsexuality (attraction) is paired with the (inaction) of bridling these sexual passions using the \ncoordinating conjunction “and,” to denote equal importance of both concepts. The text then \ngoes on to use a subordinating conjunction (despite) to minimize the presence of the sentence \npreceding it—minimize the attraction itself as subordinate to the fact that “despite” the fact \nthat an individual might experience same-sex attraction, the more important facet of the \nequation is that church members “adhere to the Lord’s moral law” (i.e., abstinence/inaction). \nThis functions as dequeerified speech, which allows the Mormon Church to appear accepting \nof people as sexual beings without having to acknowledging different sexual practices, \npreferences, or orientations. This (lie)alectic provides a way for the church to avoid \nspecifically stating anti-gay views, but rather frames all sexual expression as a choice, \ndrawing attention away from the church’s explicit homophobia. The connection between \nsexual attraction and morality is not a unique doctrine to the Mormon Church. However, the \nway the discourse groups these ideas creates a tension between sexual attraction and bridling \nthese passions in a way that diverts the attention of the reader away from the correlation \nbetween Action and Repulsion, making it appear more accepting of same-sex attraction than \nit actually is. Thus, the discourse is dequeerified and appears to be accepting of multiple \nsexualities and orientations—representing same-sex attraction as no different than any other \nsexual attraction—and that the church is no more repulsed by same-sex attraction than by \n\t\t\n124 \nheterosexual attraction. And when considering the context of the discourse—a website \ndevoted to discussing the Mormon Church’s stance on same-sex attraction—the fact that they \ndo not explicitly state any reference to homosexuality or same-sex attraction is evidence of \nhow the discourse pairs these ideas to communicate their homophobia implicitly. \nIn the second example, the discourse utilizes adverbs to pair attraction and action in \n(lie)alectical ways using a similar strategy in the first example, but goes on to define where \nand when23 sexual expression in appropriate (i.e., marriage). Building their argument upon \nthe notion that the institution of marriage is the defining factor between moral and immoral \nsexual relations, it is able to appear as though its objection to homosexuality lies in the \nagency of individuals to choose to not have sex outside of marriage, again, avoiding explicit \nrejection of same-sex attraction. Yet, simultaneously, prior to the legalization of same-sex \nmarriage in the US, the church consistently funded and supported homophobic activism that \nprevented same-sex couples from joining the very institution that is the defining \ncharacteristic that would allow same-sex couples to participate in moral sexual relations—\nforever relegating them to the margins as that which is at odds with the assumed normal (i.e., \nheterosexual marriage)—as demonstrated by its explicit inclusion of “between a man and a \nwoman” when defining marriage. Additionally, the church continues to advocate for \nlegislation that would allow religious organizations to not observe same-sex marriage on \ngrounds of religious freedoms, which demonstrates further why these declarations are \n(lie)alectical in nature. This (lie)alectic dequeerifies the church’s discourse about \nhomosexuality because it places the burden of the Church’s position on same-sex attraction \non the shoulders of the individual: either comply with Church doctrine (inaction) or be \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n23 Recall that adverbs qualify or modify a noun, verb, or adjective \n\t\t\n125 \nexcommunicated (repulsion). This makes it appear as though the church is providing a way \nfor individuals to synthesize Attraction v Action through agency, when in reality, no \ndialectical tension actually exists between these two concepts—allowing the Mormon Church \nto appear accepting of LGBT-identified individuals. This is an additional element of \ndequeerification insofar as this (lie)alectic makes it appear as though the church has gay \nchurch members undercutting any claims that the Mormon Church is homophobic (i.e., the \nchurch is attempting to erase its homophobia by providing ways for LGBT-identified \nindividuals with a way to join or retain membership in the church through agency—an \nunnecessary synthesis that draws attention away from the far side of the (lie)alectic that \nreveals the correlation between Repulsion and Action). Thus, they can claim that they are not \ndenying membership to LGBT individuals, as these individuals can choose to conform to \nchurch policies or not—drawing attention away from the fact that the very policies \nthemselves are homophobic in nature. \nIn the third example, the discourse utilizes the coordinating conjunction “but” to \nindicate that the misuse of sexual expression is of equal importance as its use, because of its \nprocreative nature. The procreation argument for the demonization of homosexuality is not \nnew or unique to Mormonism. Yet, what is unique is the pairing of the terms “use” and \n“misuse” on a website entitled Mormon and Gay. This indicates an attribution of “rightness” \nor “wrongness” to sexual expression. Retreating back to its implicit strategy, the passage \ndoes not explicitly state that homosexuality is a “misuse” of procreation, rather only that \nthere are multiple ways in which procreation can be misused. This passage is (lie)alectical in \nnature because, again, it makes it appear as though the church is inclusive of same-sex \nattraction (insofar as they reject any “misuse” of procreation)—placing both heterosexual and \n\t\t\n126 \nhomosexual sex acts as a misuse of sex and procreation. However, within the contexts of a \nconversation about the Mormon Church’s stance on same-sex attraction, the implicit \nimplication here is that homosexuality is a “misuse” of sex and procreation. Again, these \nexamples functions as dequeerified speech as they allow the church to appear non-\nhomophobic, insofar as they reject fornication among same-sex and heterosexual individuals \nalike—effectively erasing the homophobic aspect of the discourse. \nHowever, reviewing church disciplinary policies regarding heterosexual fornication \nverses homosexual fornication tells a very different story indeed. Within the Mormon \nChurch, there are levels of church discipline applied to various sins committed by its \nmembers. Less severe sins require a confessing of sins to an approved church leader. Mortal \nsins (including fornication) can result in “disfellowship,” a practice in which the individual \nremains a member of the church, but is not allowed to participate in sacramental practices, \ngive public prayers, hold church offices, or attend certain meetings. Disfellowship lasts for \none-year, at which point the individual goes before the church disciplinary board again; the \nboard determines whether or not sufficient repentance and reparations have been made. \nExcommunication occurs when an individual commits a sin deemed to be “too grievous” \n(i.e., murder, incest, rape, etc.) to remain a member of the church, and then individuals are \nthus excommunicated and no longer considered members of the church. \nThe discrepancy in the Mormon Church’s representation of heterosexual fornication \nas equally grievous as homosexual fornication on the Mormon and Gay website is debunked \nby their own disciplinary policy which disfellows heterosexual fornicators and \nexcommunicates homosexual fornicators. Thus, the discourse misrepresents itself as non-\nhomophobic through (lie)alectical structures that pairs/compares heterosexual and \n\t\t\n127 \nhomosexual attractions as equally at odds with the (lie)alectical opposite of acting on those \nattractions outside of marriage, when in reality, their homophobic doctrines are evidenced in \ntheir church disciplinary policies. \nAn additional three examples of this (lie)alectic are found in the article Church \nTeachings under the Beliefs page on the Mormon and Gay website. \nFeelings of Same-Sex Attraction Are Not a Sin and We Can Choose How to Respond  \nLet us be clear: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that the \nexperience of same-sex attraction is a complex reality for many people. The \nattraction itself is not a sin, but acting on it is. Even though individuals do not \nchoose to have such attractions, they do choose how to respond to them. \nWhile same-sex attraction is not a sin, it can be a challenge. While one may not have \nchosen to have these feelings, he or she can commit to keep God’s commandments.  \n All three of these examples use similar strategies to the examples given from the Self-\nMastery and Sexual Expression article, and I include these examples to reinforce how these \n(lie)alectics are salient throughout the entire discourse. I also include these examples, \nbecause they are more explicit then the examples from the Self-Mastery and Sexual \nExpression article, stating clearly that acting on same-sex attraction is a sin, a challenge, and \na violation of God’s commandments. They inferiorize the attraction itself with subordinating \nconjunctions such as “even though,” and “while,” making the (lie)alectical requirement of \nnot acting on the attraction the focus of the sentence and the defining characteristic of \nMormonism’s inclusivity of those who experience same-sex attraction and utilize their \nagency to choose to uphold righteous behavior. \n Considering all of these examples, in the introduction of this chapter, I argue that one \nof the things the discourse accomplishes is to normalize homophobic beliefs as natural and \njustified. This in-and-of-itself is a form of dequeerification, and the analysis of these \npassages reveals how the discourse attempts to normalize sexuality as a facet of human \n\t\t\n128 \nnature, yet consistently subordinates homosexuality—reinforcing heterosexuality as the \n“normal” and “natural” form of sexual expression. By setting up Attraction as the dialectical \nopposite of Action, the discourse is able to normalize heterosexuality without having to \noccupy the true dialectical space of repulsion (i.e., it can maintain a stance of heterosexuality \nas the only natural form of sexual expression without appearing to be repulsed by \nhomosexuality). \n Additionally, I argue that another thing the discourse accomplishes is that it gives its \nmembers a way to negotiate their dissonance when faced with their own feelings of same-sex \nattraction and/or the same-sex attraction experienced by others (especially family members). \nThe Attraction v. Action (lie)alectic emerges within the Stories page published on the \nwebsite, as six members of the Mormon Church narrate their experience of “coming out” (or \nhaving their children “come out”) as gay Mormons—each story containing elements of this \n(lie)alectical tensions they each felt between their attraction and actions: \nBecky’s Story: [Recall, Becky recounts her experience of her son Xian coming out to \nher as gay]. More than anything, I wanted to hear him say that even though he was \ngay, he was staying committed to the gospel. \n  \nJessyca’s Story: [At times] I felt that I couldn’t take the loneliness of not having \nsomeone while living in the gospel, but I also felt that I couldn’t live in a gay \nrelationship because of my testimony and the knowledge God has blessed me with \nabout His sacred plan. \n \nJosh’s Story: I began to explore my homosexuality by dating men. For the first time I \nunderstood why heterosexual couples fell in love and what that actually felt like. But \ndeep down, spiritually, I felt God wanted something different for me. \n \nLaurie’s Story: Then something unexpected happened. I fell in love with a woman I’d \nbeen dating. But despite the fact that my feelings for her were so strong, my testimony \ncarried a great deal of weight too—both in the sense of a strong conviction of the \ngospel as well as the weight of the conflict. \n \nRicardo’s Story: This year has been significant because I finally acknowledged that I \nam attracted to men. I always felt it but never really understood it, nor did I know \n\t\t\n129 \nhow to live authentically. Embracing this might be difficult for some Mormons to \nunderstand. It can seem as if by embracing my same-sex attraction, I am breaking a \ncommandment. For me, nothing can be further from the truth. That understanding \nand authenticity have brought peace to my life.  \n \nTonya’s Story: [Again, recall, Tonya recounts her experience of her son Xian coming \nout to her as gay]. After telling our other children, we sent an email to our parents \nand siblings entitled “Out and About,” explaining a few things about Andy’s \nexperiences as a gay Mormon. There was no social media announcement, no blog. It \njust wasn’t a secret anymore. The important thing is that Andy feels safe just being \nhimself, something he had never experienced. \n \n In these examples, these members of the Mormon Church attest to how difficult it is \nto negotiate feelings of same-sex attraction—acknowledging their attraction to members of \nthe same-sex and then pairing those experiences (using coordinating conjunctions) to the \ninner conflict they feel over their sexual attractions being at odds with church policies and/or \ntheir testimony of the truth of the church. By reading the stories of others who have \nsuccessfully navigated their way through this struggle, this discourse provides its readers \nwith a way to stay in the church and acknowledge their same-sex attractions. That is, \naccording to the discourse, members of the Mormon Church who experience same-sex \nattraction are not required to be repulsed (occupy the dialectical opposite of their attraction), \nbut rather, must simply be like any other unmarried member of the Mormon Church and \nchoose celibacy as a means of “adher[ing] to the Lord’s moral law,” as described in the first \nexample.  \nAdditionally, it provides parents with a framework of how to respond to their \nchildren’s sexuality, as in Becky’s story about her son Xian. Becky states that “I confused \n‘loving’ with ‘condoning,’ in discussing her struggle to accept Xian’s sexuality, but then \ncame to realize that she did not have to “choose” between her son and the church, stating: \n“I’m Mormon and I have a gay son. I love him with all my heart, might, and soul. And I love \n\t\t\n130 \nmy religion with all my heart, might, and soul. It's the core of who I am. I will never, never, \never turn my back on my son, and I will never, never, ever leave my religious faith. Period” \n(Becky’s Story). In this way, the (lie)alectic works in reverse (i.e., Just because I am not \nrepulsed by my child’s sexuality does not mean I condone it). It provides parents with a \nframework that does not require them to be repulsed by their child’s sexuality or to choose \nbetween their child and their religion. \nFurthermore, it (in theory) alleviates the true dialectical tension of ambivalence by \nallowing members to acknowledge their feelings of same-sex attraction and not have those \nfeelings be at odds with church policy (i.e., just don’t act on those feelings). That is, the \ndiscourse acknowledges that same-sex attraction is a “complex reality for many people,” and \nthus, provides a way for members of the Mormon Church to accept their sexuality (and/or \nsexuality of their children) without feelings of conflict or ambivalence. This \nreduction/elimination of ambivalence and providing a framework where one can be both \nMormon and gay stands to affect member retention in addition to augmenting the appearance \nof the Mormon Church as a non-homophobic entity. \nConclusion \n In this chapter, I provided an analysis of the Mormon and Gay website to substantiate \nmy claims that the discourse normalizes homophobic beliefs, gives members of the Mormon \nChurch a way to negotiate same-sex attraction in themselves and others, and gives them a \nway to talk about same-sex attraction with others without appearing homophobic. Identifying \ntwo (lie)alectics (Being v Fleeting, and Attraction v Action) demonstrates how the discourse \ncreates logical fallacies that, when examined closely, reveal the unstated ideologies present in \nthe discourse. These (lie)alectics are evidence of a rhetorical strategy that when the discourse \n\t\t\n131 \ncrosses two concepts and represents them as dialectical, a relationship between these two \nconcepts now exists discursively and the examination of this relationship reveals the \nunderlying assumptions of the Mormon Church and its aim to remove/draw attention away \nfrom the homophobic nature of the discourse (i.e., dequeerification). That is, the Being v \nFleeting (lie)alectic draws attention away from the relationship between Fleeting/Nothing to \ndownplay the homophobic doctrine that equates queer identities fleeting and therefore \nultimately nothing. And again, in the Attraction v Action, the relationship between \nRepulsion/Action is never acknowledged, while the connection between Attraction/Inaction \nis utilized to generate a narrative of acceptance through abstinence—all the while wielding \nagency as the justification for their seemingly non-existent homophobia. The next chapter \nwill provide a discussion of the implications of such discourses to impact public policies \naffecting the everyday material realities of those claiming non-heterosexual identities. \n\t\t\n132 \nCHAPTER 6 \nDISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS \nIntroduction \n To begin this chapter, I return to the goals of this research to 1) expose underlying \nanti-gay ideologies on the Mormon and Gay website inherent in (lie)alectical structure of the \ntext, 2) provide a way to assess the implications of these (lie)alectical structures to reinforce \nheteronormative ideologies, and 3) extrapolate the potential of such discourses to shape state \nand federal US policies that directly impact the material realities of LGBTQ-identified \nindividuals. Chapter six accomplished the first goal of identifying and interpreting the Being \nv Fleeting, and Attraction v Action (lie)alectics and how these structures reinforce \nhomophobic beliefs, how they give members of the Mormon Church a way to negotiate \nsame-sex attraction in themselves and others, and how the texts give members a way to talk \nabout same-sex attraction with others without appearing homophobic. \nIn this chapter, I address the second and third goals of this study and discuss the \nimplications of this discourse. To accomplish this, I provide a discussion of the implications \nof (lie)alectic functioning as dequeerified speech, including: 1) addressing my positionalities \nwithin this research, 2) examining new homophobia within the context of the Christian Right, \n3) discussing the current structure of the First Amendment and proposed alterations that \nwould reinforce homophobia, and 4) extrapolating extended consequences of such discourse \nto infiltrate the redefining of the First Amendment.  \nImplications of (Lie)alectics as Dequeerified Speech \nThe implications of this rhetoric rings so disturbingly clear to me that I find myself by \nturns not knowing where to begin this section. And it is because these implications are so \n\t\t\n133 \nobvious to me that it was at this juncture that I realized I must begin this discussion by \nreturning “home” as it were, and address my own positionalities in interpreting this \ndiscourse. Returning to the fundamentals of Critical Rhetoric, and Ono & Sloop’s (1992) \nreading of Foucault, my choice in the subject matter of this research and the rhetorical \nstrategies I have used to deconstruct the text are of equal importance to the examination and \nanalysis itself. That is, Critical Rhetoric acknowledges the significance of the researcher’s \nchoice in artifact insofar as positionalities affect the overall goal of Critical Rhetoric: a \ncommitment to bring about social change, a telos (Ono & Sloop, 1992)—and for me, a \ncommitment to affecting political and social change in the treatment of LGBTQ individuals \nin the US. I also begin this conversation here because it is important to assess one’s own \npositionalities through good reflexivity, and given that I identify as a lesbian and was raised \nin the Mormon Church, it is important for me to account for this fact in my discussion of my \nanalysis, lest I simply be grinding an axe against the Mormon Church for my years spent \nsubscribing to its oppressive ideologies. Thus, I offer an inside look into the mind of an ex-\nMormon lesbian—a woman who believed so wholeheartedly in the religion she was raised \non that she spent 28 years digesting and accepting homophobic and racist ideologies as  \nabsolute Truth, and emerges nearly a decade later dismantling those same ideologies in a \nsingle (albeit small) effort to resist these types of discourses. \nInside the Mind of the Lemming: My Story of Internalized Homophobia \nGrowing up in a small farming community in Southeastern Idaho (93% Mormon, \n74% white, and 2% non-heterosexual)24, I was raised on narratives of post-racial and \nhomophobic rhetoric justifying the lack of diversity and acts of discrimination as sanctioned \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n24 According to 2000 US Census data while I was living in Blackfoot, Idaho. \n\t\t\n134 \nby Mormonism’s version of a white, heterosexual God. Positioning African Americans as \ndecedents of Cain and Native American populations as the decedents of an equally \ncondemned character in The Book of Mormon25, and from a “hate the sin, love the sinner” \nmodel, I experienced first-hand the ideological structures occurring at both micro and macro \nlevels, which policed queer bodies and regulated them to the margins (i.e., the only \n“presumed” lesbian I even knew about was fired from my high school for “insubordination.” \nIf there were other gay people living in the town of Blackfoot, Idaho, they were successfully \ncovert in their identities). As such, there was no modeling in my life for what I was \nbiologically experiencing nor any conceptualization of what lesbianism was—not even to \nembrace stereotypical media representations of lesbianism until 1997 when Ellen “came out” \nduring the infamous “Puppy Episode” of her self-named sitcom. So, it wasn’t until my \nsophomore year of high school that I began to experience my sexual impulses as somehow \nattached to an “identity,” and it would not be long before my identity became a matter of \nconstant negotiation. Identifying with a religion that framed homosexuality as a sin, my \nsexual identity evoked a sense of shame—a point of non-identity, or an avoidance of labeling \nmy identity—lest I be what I condemned. \nTracing back my journey of maturation, my first “non-celebrity / fantasy” female \ncrush occurred at summer camp—as so many of these stories do. She was a camp \ncounselor—four years older than me—leading the games, sing-alongs, and spiritual \ndevotionals by the campfire each night. So much of the camp was centered around \ndeveloping a personal relationship with God through communing with nature, prayer, and \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n25 According to Mormon doctrine, the Native Americans are the descendants of Laman, a \nwicked ruler in The Book of Mormon, and were cursed with a darkened skin so that “they \nmight not be enticing unto [God’s] people.” \n\t\t\n135 \nscripture study. So, the majority of my interactions with “Jane” became mingled with the \npowerful, overwhelming, full-body emotional reaction I had come to associate as the \npresence of the holy spirit whispering God’s truth to me. And it started getting difficult to \ndifferentiate between the feelings of attraction I was having for Jane and this “burning \nsensation” associated with the spirit of God, and thus very easy to rationalize them all as the \nlatter.  \nSo, every time I experienced sexual attraction to Jane, it became quite easy to pass it \noff as feeling the spirit of God in response to this spiritual giant that I “looked up to,” as an \nolder, more mature, protagonist figure in my life. Yet, as so many of us who have emerged \nfrom the proverbial closet will tell you, denial is a fair-weathered bitch; and I found myself \nchronically kneeling in prayer admitting to God that I wasn’t sure if what I felt for Jane was \nrighteous or not and pleading for forgiveness if I had engaged impure thoughts or desires. \nAnd I can still remember the most harrowing night of all. After receiving a lesson on chastity \nthe previous Sunday, I met with my spiritual leader plagued with guilt over my discovery of \nmasturbation at twelve-years-old. I couldn’t even say the word; I had to write it down and \nslide the paper across the mahogany table. Having been told that masturbation caused people \nto become too familiar with their own bodies and would eventually lead to feelings of being \nattracted to other women, I went home and I pleaded with God to “take it away,” (not even \nquite sure what “it” was) bargaining with promises of increased prayer, fasting, service, \nscripture study, certainly abstaining from “self harm” behaviors, and never engaging with \nJane again—a strategy of avoidance that would serve me for the next six years remaining in \nthe isolated community of rural Idaho. \n\t\t\n136 \nMy second notable crush was no less cliché than the first—my first college \nroommate. I attended a small Mormon college in eastern Idaho in a town hardly bigger than \nthe one I was raised in. Sharing a room with two twin beds, we had positioned the beds in \nsuch a way as to allow us to hold hands at night when we would fall asleep. I facilitated this \nunder the ruse that it was my first year away from home and would cry myself to sleep every \nnight. So “Jenn” would hold my hand at night, eventually escalating to sleeping in the same \nbed, and on the night we first kissed, I felt so much guilt that I locked myself in the 15-square \nfeet of our apartment’s bathroom—curled up in the bathtub, contemplating suicide—until \nafter she left in the morning. When she returned home that evening, we both decided we \nshould confess what had happened to our spiritual leader, at which time Jenn told him that \nshe did not have feelings for me, but I could not do the same. I was removed from the \napartment and sent to live in another building that had a single room with no roommate, and I \nbegan work with a therapist who specialized in issues of “gender confusion,” (i.e., \nconversion therapy). \nAfter working with therapists for nearly two years, I consulted with my spiritual \nleader about the fact that I wasn’t experiencing any change in my heart, despite the therapy, \nand prayers, and scripture reading, and fasting—nothing seemed to be helping. He recited a \npassage of scripture that told me that if I confessed and denounced my sins publicly, I would \nbe filled with the Lord’s spirit and receive immediate forgiveness in my repentance. So, \nduring the next Fast and Testimony26 meeting, I “outed” myself as having feelings for other \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n26 Every first Sunday of the month, the Mormon Church observes what is called Fast and \nTestimony meeting. All members of the church fast for two meals and donate the money they \nwould have used for those meals to go to impoverished church members. During church \nservices on that Sunday, the pulpit is left open for members to voluntarily stand and bear \n\t\t\n137 \nwomen, but that I was devoted to doing God’s will, and then waited for my glorious \nforgiveness—which, of course, never came. In its place, shame and humiliation followed \nthrough exclusion, ridicule, and betrayal by the people I felt I needed the most support from. \nSo, I fled—away from what had once been my safety net—to the only other safe haven I \nknew, family. I lived with my brother in Portland, Oregon and worked for a Mormon \nbookstore, but with a new set of church members I would never disclose my sexuality to, all \nthe while still attending church and subscribing to the doctrines of my youth. \nSo, when I started classes at Portland Community College in Oregon in 2002, the \nworld outside of Idaho was frightening to me. I had never encountered a lesbian, as far as I \nwas aware, and I feared the dreaded myths of the liberal agenda and the gay agenda to \nseduce all heterosexuals into a homosexual lifestyle. I viewed tolerance as a radical \nrelativism that left me vulnerable to a world that would validate my attraction to other \nwoman and that must not be fostered. Yielding to these fears, I turned to the comfort of \nchurch spiritual leaders who reinforced my internalized homophobia and guaranteed me that \nif I stopped engaging my root cause of homosexuality—never again looked at pornography \nor engaged in masturbation—these feelings of same-sex attraction would go away. \nI had bought into the notion of the “war on Christianity,” and still believed that \nthrough faith, prayer, fasting, and scripture study, my efforts to “pray the gay away” would \nbe met with an eternal reward far better than any temporal relationship I might engage in this \nmortal world; Living and engaging with people outside of “the Church” would not lure me \ninto giving into my temptations, no matter how the world assaulted God’s plan. It would be \nanother long ten years before the layers of my faith would be stripped away one-by-one until \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nwitness of their testimony of the church, including struggles they’ve had with sin and \ntemptations. \n\t\t\n138 \nI no longer attended church and stopped believing in the principles of Mormonism enough to \ninvestigate my sexuality. Yet, even after leaving the church and taking on the identity of \nlesbian, I still felt no anger toward the Mormon Church. By the time I had accepted my \nsexuality as an identity in 2013, the Mormon Church had already started shifting toward their \nchurch policy that same-sex attraction was not a sin, only the act. Even having lived through \nthe horrors of being gay while attempting to stay active in the Mormon Church, I still did not \nsee the harm underlying the ideologies and doctrines (i.e., live and let live). I did not \nbegrudge people their faith in something that brought them comfort, even if that faith \ndespised me; in some ways, I missed the security of my religious beliefs and felt a sense of \njealousy for those who could continue to blindly believe in a predestined future that gave \ntheir lives purpose and meaning.  \nSo, when I started investigating Mormonism’s stance on homosexuality more \nthoroughly in my graduate works beginning in 2013, I did not choose my artifacts of \nexamination from a deep-rooted need for revenge, nor did I anticipate finding anything more \nnefarious than a redundant “hate the sin, love the sinner” model that many other Christian \ndenominations subscribe to. Yet, my knowledge and experiences of living the life of a “gay \nMormon” before it was okay to be a “gay Mormon” primed me to see beyond the surface of \nthis discourse. And the emergence of (lie)alectics could only come from these experiences \nthat would take me many more years to label them for what they actually were: Trauma. \nKnowing firsthand the injury that comes from “splitting,” a psychological phenomenon of \ntrauma, where individuals separate off parts of themselves that are incompatible with their \ncore identity and see the world in extremes of all-or-nothing and black-and-white thinking, \nwas I able to see the incompatible nature of the ideologies present in Mormonism’s discourse \n\t\t\n139 \nsurrounding LGBTQ issues. In essence, these strategies existed in my psyche long before I \nbegan my investigation, and it was not until I looked at them through a lens of homophobia \nthat I was able to understand the importance of this project. \nI once ran into a former mentor at the National Communication Association \nconference who criticized my decision to continue researching Mormonism, telling me that \nshe thought I chose to research Mormonism because it was “easy,” and that I was avoiding \nstretching myself as a scholar. Nothing could be further from the truth. Drudging through \none’s own trauma week-after-week for over two years is not easy; it is a commitment. It is a \ncommitment to utilizing my positionalities to bring about social change. \nWith that, I also bring an insider perspective on the mindset of the Christian Right’s \nattempts to shape public policies. While most other Christian denominations do not recognize \nMormonism as a Christian religion, Mormons do consider themselves Christians and endorse \nmany of the same beliefs of Evangelical Christians in the US (i.e., pro-life, anti same-sex \nmarriage). Aligning with those beliefs, while I was active in the Mormon Church, I \nwholeheartedly believed that to vote for a presidential candidate who supported something I \ndid not believe in was a sinful act. God had a plan for me, and part of that plan was to bring \nothers unto Christ and to avoid sin and temptation. Ergo, I believed that religious freedoms \nguaranteed Christians the right to shape public policy based on beliefs alone. I had no \nconceptualization of what the First Amendment actually did or did not guarantee US \nAmerican citizens, only that I felt oppressed when in the presence of others participating in \nbehaviors that contradicted my religious beliefs. My ability to rationalize any inconsistency \nwith my paramount belief system is now quite troubling to me, especially when \ncontemplating the fact that many people within Christian-based faiths are taught to be \n\t\t\n140 \nstalwart in their beliefs and not waver in the face of false Gods and prophets (i.e., non-\nreligious politicians). Understanding this mindset and its ability to rationalize circuitous \nlogics of homophobia ignites the exigence in addressing discourse that would parade itself \naround as non-homophobic—both from within and outside of the belief system. So, I include \nmy story here to make it clear that this discourse is not benign. What it asks of its members is \nnot benign. What it asked of me was not benign. And, the implications of this discourse to \nshape public policy surrounding religious freedoms in the US are not benign. Thus, the \nremainder of this chapter unpacks new homophobia and the potential of this discourse to \nreshape the First Amendment and religious freedoms in the US to marginalize and \ndiscriminate against protected classes. \nFostering Internalized Homophobia \nKnowing that had I stayed the course of Mormonism, I might very well have been a \ngood candidate to be represented on the Stories portion of the Mormon and Gay website—an \narticulate, educated woman still devoted to doing God’s will—I dedicate this section of my \ndissertation to those members of the Mormon Church who are directly impacted by the \nChurch’s position on same-sex attraction. In this section, I highlight the material realities of \nwhat living as a gay Mormon truly asks of these individuals, and highlight the implications of \n(lie)alectics as a tool to maintain membership regardless of the impact on individuals and \nfamilies in the Mormon Church. \nReturning to the true dialectic: Attraction à Ambivalence ß Repulsion, as the \n(lie)alectic is a ruse representing itself as a means of being both Mormon and Gay, what the \ndiscourse truly asks of these individuals is to live in a constant state of ambivalence about \ntheir sexual identity—to be eternally at odds with a core portion of who they experience \n\t\t\n141 \nthemselves to be. And you see the true dialectic of ambiguity seep out in the captions \nintroducing these stories. Jessyca’s Story is introduced by saying: “She still isn’t sure \nwhether she will remain single, but that’s her plan right now. She’s not sure she will ever \nfind a guy she can be attracted to.” Similarly, Josh’s Story is introduced saying: “He doesn’t \nknow what his life will look like in a few years, but he knows God is with him to show him \nwhat it’s supposed to look like today.” In fact, Tonya’s Story explicitly refers to same-sex \nattraction as a spiritual ambiguity: “According to Tonya Miller, coming out is a process, not \nan event. At least, that’s what she witnessed with her son Andy. And despite the spiritual \nambiguity that still surrounds being a gay Mormon, the important thing is that Andy feels \nsafe being himself, something he had never experienced before.” \nNew Homophobia and the Redefining of Religious Freedoms by the Christian Right   \nWhile a goodly portion of the Christian Right continues to pay little interest to \ncurtailing their blatantly homophobic objection to homosexual lifestyles, advancements in \nLGBTQ legislation in the US has increasingly placed religious organizations in a Catch-22 of \nnew homophobia—either they maintain their anti-gay policies overtly and endure social \nbacklash and accusations of discrimination for their homophobic beliefs, or they remove the \novert homophobic portion of their discourse and rebrand their homophobia as a “conditional \nacceptance” of sorts. Returning to discussions of discursive deracialization and \ndequeerification, just as Goodman and Burke (2011) suggest that race can be viewed as a \nparticularly “unpalatable reason for opposing outgroups,” so too religious organizations are \nreframing their arguments as fundamental violations of First Amendment rights to side-step \nthe homophobic context of their underlying reasons for claiming those rights in the first \nplace. In a similar maneuver to Goodman and Rowe’s (2014) study regarding the \n\t\t\n142 \nracialization of Gypsies, the fundamental nature of these arguments regarding LGBTQ rights \nbeing in conflict with religious freedoms is grounded in factors of identity (i.e., does \nsexuality constitute a facet of identity?)  \nIn Goodman and Rowe’s (2014) study, respondents concluded that the identity of \n“Gypsy” did not constitute a “race,” and therefore opposition to the notion of Gypsy was not \nan instance of racism. Similarly, state and federal anti-discrimination laws have increasingly \nincluded sexual identity as a protected class, which is the defining characteristic that places \nreligious freedoms in conflict with anti-discrimination laws—especially when reflecting on \nthe (lie)alectics present on the Mormon and Gay website that clearly relegate sexuality as a \nfeeling or temporary characteristic and not an identity inherent to an individual. Thus, in the \nsame way that Wetherell and Potter’s (2002) study of the Maori people in New Zealand \nrevealed the way that the deracialized speech “explain[ed] away the inequalities between the \ndominant ‘white’ and the indigenous Maori New Zealanders in ways that ignored the \nongoing impact of the European colonization of the county,” dequeerified speech explains \naway the inequalities of LGBTQ citizens as an unavoidable consequence of being at odds \nwith religious freedoms that refuse to acknowledge sexuality as a facet of identity, and \ntherefore justify calls to exempt those claiming religious freedoms from treating LGBTQ \npeople as a protected class. To better understand this maneuver, I provide a brief overview of \nthe history of the First Amendment’s rights to freedom of religion, and offer an explanation \nof what religious freedoms are and what they are not to demonstrate exactly what \ndequeerified speech stands to accomplish in altering the role and function of religious \nfreedoms in the US. \nThe First Amendment: What constitutes a Religious Freedom?  \n\t\t\n143 \nThe First Amendment of the US Constitution includes two clauses pertaining to \nreligion. The first clause, the Establishment Clause, prohibits the government from \nestablishing a national religion or to privilege one religion over another (whitehouse.gov). \nThe second clause, the Free Exercise Clause, guarantees the freedom of all American citizens \nto accept any religious belief and engage in religious rituals. It also guarantees that a person \ncannot be compelled to violate their religious beliefs (whitehouse.gov). However, some \nprovisions have been made, revisiting the Reynolds v United States case discussed in chapter \none, the courts concluded that individuals cannot reasonably excuse themselves from \nupholding the law because of their religious beliefs, otherwise every citizen must be \npermitted to become a law unto him/herself. \nYet, applications of religious freedoms are rarely this clear or straight forward. \nMichael McConnel (2002) discusses the ways the First Amendment is often in conflict with \nitself in Religion and the Constitution: \nIf there is a constitutional requirement for accommodation of religious conduct, it will \nmost likely be found in the Free Exercise Clause. Some say, though, that it is a \nviolation of the Establishment Clause for the government to give any special benefit \nor recognition of religion. In that case, we have a First Amendment in conflict with \nitself—the Establishment Clause forbidding what the Free Exercise Clause requires. \n(105) \n \nThis is certainly the case in current proposed cases such as the Masterpiece Cake \nSupreme Court case and other proposed legislation covered in the chapter four. Here, I argue \nthat (lie)alectical discourses, as an element of dequeerified speech, have the potential to \naccomplish alterations in the First Amendment’s rights to freedom of religion in two \nsignificant ways. Legitimizing homophobia as a religious freedom and/or exempting \nreligious organizations from federal anti-discrimination laws by defining their doctrines as \n\t\t\n144 \nnon-homophobic, 1) redefines what constitutes a compulsory violation of religious beliefs, \nand 2) extends religious freedoms to policing behaviors, policies, and bodies into conformity \nwith the doctrines of the dominant religious organizations within the US—already \nsubstantiated as Evangelical Christians and the Christian Right. \nRedefining Violations of Religious Freedoms. As part of the Free Expression \nClause of the First Amendment, citizens of the US are guaranteed that they cannot be \ncompelled to violate their religious beliefs. This guarantees that those subscribing to religious \nobjections to homosexuality cannot be compelled by the government to engage in \nhomosexuality. However, proposed legislation, such as the Masterpiece Cake Supreme Court \ncase, would extend these violations of religious freedoms to include the sale of goods and \npublic accommodations to LGBTQ individuals as being compelled to violate their religious \nfreedoms because providing services and public accommodations is a form of participation in \nthe ceremonies they object to.  \nSince this study is examining the Mormon Church, a clear-cut example of this is that \nunder current applications of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, the \ngovernment cannot compel someone claiming membership in the Mormon Church to drink \nalcohol, because complete abstinence is in fact a core Mormon doctrine. However, proposed \nlegislation would be the equivalent of allowing Mormon Uber or Lyft drivers to refuse to \ndrive someone to a bar or club if their rider admits her/his intentions to drink that night (i.e., \nthe act of driving the passenger to a location that contradicts their religious beliefs would \nconstitute participation in the actions that occur after the transaction is complete). In like \nfashion, refusing to sell a cake based on the notion of what that cake is being used for after it \n\t\t\n145 \nis purchased is not currently protected under the Free Exercise Clause of the First \nAmendment. Current proposed legislation seeks to change that. \nFor example, plaintiff General Francisco, in the Masterpiece Cake case, compared \nforcing a Christian baker to make a cake for a gay wedding to be the equivalent of forcing “a \ngay opera singer to perform at the Westboro Baptist Church just because that opera singer \nwould be willing to perform at the National Cathedral” (Oral Arguments, pg. 47)—equating \nmaking a cake as a form of speech, which would violate the Free Expression Clause of the \nFirst Amendment that an individual cannot be compelled to violate her/his religious beliefs. \nThis suggests that engaging issues of speech is enough to outmaneuver anti-discrimination \nlaws. \nSimilarly, in the Religious Freedoms and Nondiscrimination press conference \nreleased by the Mormon Church prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, while not \nofficial proposed legislation, is quite clear about this intended trajectory:  \nIn addition to institutional protections, individual people of faith must maintain their \nconstitutional rights. This would include living in accordance with their deeply held \nreligious beliefs, including choosing their profession or employment and serving in \npublic office without intimidation, coercion or retaliation from another group. For \nexample, a Latter-day Saint physician who objects to performing…artificial \ninsemination for a lesbian couple should not be forced against his or her conscience to \ndo so, especially when others are readily available to perform that function. Another \nexample, a neighborhood Catholic pharmacist, who declines to carry the “morning \nafter” pill when large pharmacy chains readily offer them, should likewise not be \npressured into violating his or her conscience by bullying or boycotting. (Newsroom, \n2015, n.p.) \n \n This movement toward redefining what constitutes Free Expression under the \nreligious freedoms clause of the First Amendment is particularly affected by the (lie)alectical \nframeworks outlined in chapter six and the application of dequeerified speech in the \npresentation of arguments made for changes to protected rights for religiously identified \n\t\t\n146 \npeople. That is, the defining characteristic that currently prevents these types of maneuvers \nfrom being constitutional is the addition of gender and sexual orientation as a protected class \nto anti-discrimination laws. However, ideologies such as the Being v Fleeting (lie)alectic puts \nforth a religious belief in conflict with state and federal recognition of gender and sexual \norientation as a facet of identity warranting placement among other protected classes, giving \norganizations like the Mormon Church traction in their calls for exempting “people of faith” \nfrom sustaining anti-discrimination laws that directly contradict/interfere with their own \nprotected class of subscribing to a particular religious organization, and/or with church \ndoctrine that does not recognize sexual orientation as a facet of identity. \n Additionally, the Attraction v Action (lie)alectic provides another avenue upon which \nclaims to exemption can be legitimized. The Attraction v Action (lie)alectic is predicated \nupon the notion that a person can be gay and retain membership in the church so long as that \nindividual does not act on their sexual impulses to engage in homosexual sex acts. In this \nway, an objection to providing public accommodations to a gay couple can be represented as \na rejection of service that is not grounded in issues of sexual orientation. That is, the Mormon \nChurch openly recognizes sexual orientation as an acceptable characteristic of individuals, \nand what they are objecting to is the action of the individuals—not the individuals \nthemselves. And anti-discrimination laws, being grounded in facets of identity, currently \nmake no accommodations for discrimination based on people’s behaviors. Thus, what the \ndiscourse has the potential to accomplish is backdoor state-sanctioned discrimination of \nLGBTQ people based on religious freedoms grounded in dequeerified speech that erases the \nhomophobic nature of the discourse. \nExtending Religious Freedoms: A Slippery Slope of Discrimination \n\t\t\n147 \nThis discussion would be incomplete without furthering the implications of allowing \nreligious organizations and individuals to exempt themselves from observing anti-\ndiscrimination laws in one category (sexual orientation) without recognizing the potential of \nsuch a maneuver to be utilized as justification in exempting themselves from observing anti-\ndiscrimination laws that apply to any other protected class (i.e., race, gender, class, other \nreligions, etc.). Justice Kennedy acknowledges this concern on the part of the court in the \nMasterpiece Cake case pointing to cases involving conflicts between religious beliefs \nregarding mixed marriages stating that: “the problem is that America’s reaction to mixed \nmarriages and to race didn’t change on its own. It changed because we had public \naccommodation laws that forced people to do things that many claimed were against their \nexpressive rights and against their religious rights” (p. 56). Here, Kennedy points to the \ninitiation of anti-discrimination laws that prevented religious organizations from \ndiscriminating based on race, which has since been extended to class, religion, gender, and \nsexual orientation. In essence, what Kennedy is pointing to here is that in areas of public \naccommodations, etc., social change was forced through the government’s enforcement of \nanti-discrimination policies. As such, providing an exception to religious organizations to \nany of these protected classes necessarily puts all protected classes at risk for religious \norganizations to legitimize racism, classism, sexism, etc. \n To pose a few hypothetical situations, imagine for a moment a religion with similar \ntenets to the Mormon Church on receiving revelations from God (e.g., changing policies on \npolygamy) and now subscribes to the notion that homosexuality is God’s answer to issues of \nover-population. The proposed changes to the First Amendment in allowing religious \nfreedoms to supersede anti-discrimination laws would likewise allow that religious \n\t\t\n148 \norganization, businesses owners affiliated with that religion, and individual members of that \nreligion to refuse service to individuals participating in heterosexual sex. Similarly, a \nreligious organization opposed to inter-racial relationships or marriage could likewise refuse \nto recognize that marriage as not based on race, but on the behavior of performing sexual acts \nbetween people of different races. And a religious organization subscribing to the notion that \na woman’s place is in the home would be equally protected in refusing employment to \nwomen—not because they are women, but because their religious belief objects to the \nbehavior of women engaging in gainful employment. \n As ridiculous as these hypothetical scenarios are, and I chose hyperbolic situations \nspecifically to point out the ever-inherent problem of the discourse’s underlying aim to \nredefine religious freedoms in the US; Where do we draw the line? If we allow individual \ndoctors to refuse medical services to lesbian couples as a matter of evoking their First \nAmendment rights (as is directly proposed in the Religious Freedoms and Nondiscrimination \npress conference example), how do the courts differentiate between a religious belief that is \ndiscriminating based on the behaviors of a lesbian couple and the behaviors of an unmarried \ncouple, which the Mormon Church purports to equally oppose? How do the courts \ndifferentiate between the proposed amendments to provide exemptions to anti-discrimination \nlaws in any other area if exemptions are made on the grounds of sexual orientation and \nidentity? And religious affiliation being a protected class itself, what prevents anyone \nclaiming exemption of anti-discrimination laws from discriminating against anyone who \nparticipates in any behavior contradictory to any doctrine of that individual or entity? \nMormon doctrine has bylaws about not having tattoos. What differentiates their claims to \nexemptions to serving LGBTQ individuals from exemptions of individuals who participated \n\t\t\n149 \nin the behavior of getting a tattoo? Or an individual who drinks alcohol? Or coffee? Or an \nindividual who violates their modesty codes by wearing a sleeveless shirt? \n What I hope this list of questions highlights is the underlying threat of the proposed \nalterations of the First Amendment to allow dominant religious ideologies to govern and \npolice others who violate the personal moral values of the Christian Right, and that while \nLGBTQ issues are the central focus of current proposed religious freedom acts, the latitude \nof these changes would require a religious organization only to adopt a doctrine based on \nbehavior (e.g., an African American who performs blackness) to legitimize their exclusion \nand discrimination.  \nThis brings the conversation back to the argument that these (lie)alectical structures \nare a preemptive counterstrike to perceived threats on religious freedoms. Specifically, the \nrhetorical situation that has emerged out of the most recent presidential administrations in the \nUS that have expanded anti-discrimination laws to include sexual identity as a protected \nclass, religious organizations subscribing to homophobic doctrines will find themselves at \nodds with federal law in denying membership to their religious organization based on sexual \nidentity. The Mormon Church’s erasure of their homophobia through the (lie)alectical \nstructure that allow them to conditionally allow LGBTQ-identified individuals to be \nmembers of their faith will exempt them from their discriminatory behavior being recognized \nas discriminatory. It will allow them to continue to exclude LGBTQ individuals in \nconditional ways. \nConclusion \n The ever-contested history of the construction of law has been at the very heart of \nhow rights are created, changed, perceived, and talked about. (Lie)alectical discourses have \n\t\t\n150 \nthe potential to alter First Amendment rights surrounding issues of religious freedoms \nthrough a process of dequeerification—positioning religious organizations as non-\nhomophobic through the discursive erasure of explicit homophobic doctrines and beliefs. As \nI have argued throughout this chapter, the addition of sexual orientation and identity to anti-\ndiscrimination laws has put homophobic religious organizations in a position to redefine \nreligious freedoms if they are to maintain their homophobic doctrines. Cases such as the \nMasterpiece Cakeshop v Colorado Civil Rights Commission demonstrate the continuing \nconflict between First Amendment rights to religious freedoms and Fourteenth Amendment \nrights to equal protection under the law for protected classes. So too, the Mormon and Gay \nwebsite demonstrates the underlying rhetorical strategy of the Mormon Church to appear \nnon-homophobic as a means of defense against accusations of homophobia. By so doing, the \nMormon Church can claim to have gay members of their congregations, while maintaining a \nconstructed space of homophobia with doctrines that position non-heterosexual identities as \nat odds with its doctrine. Thus, having gay members, any act of discrimination against \nLGBTQ-identified individuals can be perceived—not as discrimination related to an \nindividual’s identity—but as a refusal to provide service based on an individual’s behavior. \n Furthermore, following this model, a religious organization need only develop any \nbelief—rooted in behavior—to sidestep anti-discrimination laws, allowing them to police and \npunish behaviors that are incongruent with their religious beliefs (i.e., same-sex marriage, \ninterracial marriage, artificial insemination for lesbians or interracial couples, etc.). Returning \nto Crowley’s (2007) discussion on Christian privilege in the US, this chapter is an explication \nof her statement that “Christian conservatives wish to impose a standard of moral behavior \non all of us so that they can easily discern—and discipline—those who depart from it” (p. \n\t\t\n151 \n104). In quite the opposite direction, this chapter calls for the protection of the Establishment \nClause of the First Amendment—the portion of the First Amendment that restrains the \ngovernment from passing legislation establishing a national religion or from privileging any \nreligious entity over another. Arguably, allowing conservative Christians the right to \ndiscipline/punish behaviors they deem sinful is an establishment of legislation privileging \nChristianity over other belief systems (i.e., a Christian belief that homosexuality is a sin does \nnot entitle the government to take away other citizen’s right to sin)—lest the government \nalign itself too closely with doctrines of Christianity to claim non-establishment of a national \nreligion. \n \n\t\t\n152 \nCHAPTER 7 \nCONCLUSIONS \nSummary \nThe development and application of (lie)alectics as a theoretical framework has been \nupwards of a three-year project beginning in 2015 when the Mormon Church released their \nReligious Freedoms and Nondiscrimination press conference comparing religious freedoms \nto nondiscrimination as dialectically in tension with each other. My interest in this \ncomparison grew as I was able to repeatedly identify this pattern throughout the discourse \nand has expanded as this theory has held true of the discourse on the Mormon and Gay \nwebsite, and here I provide a summary of this research. \nIn Chapter one, I argue the importance of examining emerging religious discourses, \nwhich aim to marginalize the LGBTQ community in the US. The vector of influence the \nMormon Church has to impact legislative choices is substantial and has the potential to \nexempt those claiming religious freedoms from upholding anti-discrimination laws \npertaining to sexual orientation and identity. To that end, I argue that the Mormon and Gay \nwebsite is problematic discourse because it seeks to position the Mormon Church—a \nhistorically homophobic religious entity—as non-homophobic by portraying itself as wiling \nto recognize sexual identities, while still seeking to exempt religious organizations from \nsubstantiating anti-discrimination laws. The potential of this discourse to shape public policy \nsets a trajectory that would leave protected classes vulnerable to any person claiming \nreligious freedoms as the justification for refusal to adhere to anti-discrimination laws. \nThe discourse on the Mormon and Gay website warrants textual analysis because the \ntheory of (lie)alectics emerged from examination of previous Mormon discourse, and \n\t\t\n153 \nexamining this more comprehensive artifact stands to demonstrate the generalizability of \n(lie)alectics to Mormon discourse, which will provide the platform for determining further \napplications of (lie)alectics. Additionally, the Mormon and Gay website is arguably the most \nin-depth publicly published website by a religious organization regarding LGBT-related \nissues, and examination of Mormon discourse is of additional value because of the affluence \nand growth rate of the organization and its history of supporting anti-gay legislation. In this \nchapter I propose three research goals aimed at identification of anti-gay messages within the \ntext, contextualize those structures, and provide implications of the identified messages. \nIn chapter two, I argue that the evolving stance on homosexuality and LGBTQ rights \nin the US is important to understanding the larger implications of this research: religious \ndiscourses shaping public policies that discriminate against and marginalize queer lives in the \nUS. Homosexuality has been at the center of US legislation from its criminalization to state-\nsanctioned marriage, with extensive changes in legislation over the past ten years. With these \nchanges, political pushback from the Christian Right seeks to reclaim and exert its historical \ninfluence over policing and punishing queer identities, behaviors, and performances. The \nhistory of the Mormon Church provides the important facts that demonstrate that this \ndiscourse has deep roots in homophobia and demonstrates how the Mormon Church has \nhistorically responded to conflicts of interest between church doctrine and federal law. The \nevolution of the Mormons and Gays website into the Mormon and Gay website brings \nattention to the significance of the way the Mormon Church is representing its doctrines and \npolicies that are still homophobic in nature. \nIn chapter three, I provide a review of current literature related to queer theory, \nintersectionality, and critical treatments of religious discourses to position my research within \n\t\t\n154 \nthe larger conversations surrounding these issues. I utilize this chapter to develop the \njustification for this research and situate it within current conversations about queerness, \nintersectional identities, and critical approaches to religious analyses, and to substantiate this \nresearch as recent, relevant, and applicable. I offer a definition of queer as both complex and \nspecifically focused on gender and sexuality, and demonstrate how this research fills gaps in \napplications of queer theory and intersectionality and calls for more critical approaches to \nanalysis of religious discourses. This chapter functions to communicate my understanding of \nthe conversations that precede my research. Queer theory and intersectionality are complex \nconcepts that are in conversation with each other from different disciplines, developing \nperspectives, critiquing those perspectives with a trajectory rooted in complicating, \nproblematizing, and challenging not only the discourses it critiques, but also the theories \nthemselves. \nIn chapter four, I outline (lie)alectics and discursive dequeerification as theoretical \nconstructs that can be used to deconstruct hidden ideologies within a text.  (Lie)alectics can \nbe treated as both fallacious in reasoning and a discursive strategy, which obscures blatant \nhomophobia, and in some cases, removes homophobic phrases and words in entirety from \ndiscourses through the process of dequeerification. The discussion of discursive \nderacialization in this chapter functions to demonstrate how discourses can be stripped of \nexplicitly homophobic language in similar ways that racialized speech within explicitly racist \ndiscourses gets stripped away to resist accusations of racism. In addition to the research done \non discursive deracialization, I propose (lie)alectics as a specific strategy of discursive \ndequeerification—one that does not work solely by removing homophobic language from the \ndiscourse, but also creates logical fallacies that represent themselves as steeped in reason and \n\t\t\n155 \nreasonableness (i.e., comparing non-antithetical ideas as though they were incommensurate), \nmaking the discourse appear nonthreatening in its homophobic trajectory. Through providing \nexamples, I substantiate (lie)alectics as a useful theoretical framework in understanding how \nhomophobic discourses resist labels. \nIn Chapter five, I provided an analysis of the Mormon and Gay website to \nsubstantiate my claims that the discourse normalizes homophobic beliefs, gives members of \nthe Mormon Church a way to negotiate same-sex attraction in themselves and others, and \ngives them a way to talk about same-sex attraction with others without appearing \nhomophobic. Identifying two (lie)alectics (Being v Fleeting, and Attraction v Action) \ndemonstrates how the discourse contains unstated ideologies that are concealed within \nlogical fallacies of comparing non-antithetical ideas. These (lie)alectics are evidence of a \nrhetorical strategy that when the discourse crosses two concepts and represents them as \ndialectical, a relationship between these concepts is created discursively and the examination \nof this relationship reveals the underlying assumptions of the Mormon Church and its aim to \nremove/draw attention away from the homophobic nature of the discourse (i.e., \ndequeerification). In the Being v Fleeting (lie)alectic, attention is drawn away from the \nrelationship between Fleeting/Nothing to downplay the homophobic doctrine that equates \nqueer identities as fleeting and therefore ultimately nothing. And again, in the Attraction v \nAction, the relationship between Repulsion/Action is never acknowledged, while the \nconnection between Attraction/Inaction is utilized to generate a narrative of acceptance \nthrough restraint—all the while wielding agency as the justification for their seemingly non-\nexistent homophobia. \n\t\t\n156 \n In chapter six, I discuss the potential influence of the rhetorical strategies employed \non the Mormon and Gay website to affect public policy. As reviewed in this chapter, the \never-contested history of the construction of law has been at the very heart of how rights are \ncreated, changed, perceived, and talked about in the US. (Lie)alectical discourses aim to \nmodify First Amendment rights surrounding issues of religious freedoms through a process \nof dequeerification—positioning religious organizations as non-homophobic through the \ndiscursive erasure of explicit homophobic doctrines and beliefs. The addition of sexual \norientation and identity to anti-discrimination laws has put pressure on homophobic religious \norganizations to redefine religious freedoms if they are to maintain their homophobic \ndoctrines. The conflict between First Amendment rights to religious freedoms and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights to equal protection under the law for protected classes are evident in cases \nsuch as Masterpiece Cakeshop v Colorado Civil Rights Commission. In like fashion, the \nMormon and Gay website demonstrates the underlying rhetorical strategy of the Mormon \nChurch to appear non-homophobic as a means of defense against accusations of homophobia. \nIn this way, the Mormon Church can claim to have gay members, while maintaining a \nconstructed space of homophobia with doctrines that position non-heterosexual identities as \nat odds with its doctrine. And as such, having gay members, any act of discrimination against \nLGBTQ-identified individuals can be perceived—not as discrimination based on an \nindividual’s identity—but as a refusal to provide service based on an individual’s behavior. \n Furthermore, this alteration in the functionality of the First Amendment means a \nreligious organization need only develop any belief—rooted in behavior—to sidestep anti-\ndiscrimination laws, allowing them to police and punish behaviors that are incongruent with \ntheir religious beliefs (i.e., same-sex marriage, interracial marriage, artificial insemination for \n\t\t\n157 \nlesbians or interracial couples, etc.). This move mirrors Crowley’s (2007) sentiment that the \nChristian Right wishes to impose their moral values upon US policies as a means of easily \ndiscerning and disciplining behaviors they disagree with. In quite the opposite direction, this \nchapter presents a call for the protection of the Establishment Clause of the First \nAmendment—the part of the First Amendment that restrains the US government from \npassing legislation establishing a national religion or from privileging any religious entity. I \nclose this chapter arguing that allowing conservative Christians the right to discipline/punish \nbehaviors they deem sinful is a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \ninsofar as it privileges Christian beliefs over other belief systems. That is, the federal \ngovernment cannot take away the rights of its citizens to sin, simply because the Christian \nRight deems the behavior sinful, without violating the Establishment Clause of the First \nAmendment. Thus, its own way, this dissertation is a call to take back religious freedoms, not \npertaining to the Free Expressions clause of the First Amendment, but to reclaim the right of \nUS citizens to evoke their First Amendment rights to not be governed by a religiously \naffiliated government and/or public policies shaped by those religious beliefs, tenets, and \ndoctrines. \nTheoretical Contributions and Future Research \nNow, having provided a summary of this research, I provide an overview of the \ntheoretical contributions of this research as well as future applications for (lie)alectics and \ndiscursive dequeerification in critical rhetoric, queer approaches to cultural communication, \ncritical applications of linguistics, and to critical social psychology. \nCritical Rhetoric \n\t\t\n158 \nContributions. Returning once again to Ono & Sloop’s (1992) call for a telos—a \ncommitment to social change, this research does precisely that. Utilizing a rhetorical \nanalysis, this research uncovered strategies that have the potential to alter the very foundation \nof the Constitution of the United States, and that ever called upon First Amendment that has \nbeen utilized to police and punish those who dare defy the domination of the Christian Right \nin US politics. As noted in chapter seven, the Mormon Church’s evolution in their treatment \nof homosexuality has essentially found a loophole to anti-discrimination laws, and were this \nideology to spread to other Christian approaches and similar strategies be used in denying \nservices, etc. based on behavior, rather than identity, the potential of this discourse to \ndominate and oppress LGBTQ people (and beyond) is profound and dangerous. Resisting \nthis discourse is essential to prevent further policing of behavior and social punishment for \nthose expressing non-heterosexual identities. Thus, the theoretical application of (lie)alectics \nand dequeerification contributes to the body of research being done in Critical Rhetoric, \nespecially Queer Critical Rhetoric. \nThe theory of (lie)alectics and discursive dequeerification advances applications of \nCritical Rhetoric by demonstrating how the arrangement and style of a text function to reveal \nunstated ideological assumptions hidden within a text. It allows for the rhetorical analyst to \nutilize functions of language to identify the dominant ideologies the discourse reinforces and \nthe researcher seeks to disrupt. The theory of (lie)alectics provides a way of talking about \nwhat the discourse has the potential to accomplish, revealing the strategies used by the \nauthors/producers of a text, and creating new discourse that can disrupt the advancement of \noppressive ideologies. \n\t\t\n159 \nThis particular study itself advances Critical Rhetoric by providing a way to directly \ninterrupt the advancement of homophobic and heteronormative ideologies directly related to \nUS public policies. This research is an enactment of Critical Rhetoric’s call for political and \nsocial change and adds to the body of research being done in Critical Rhetoric that does the \nsame. For example, in Pezzulo’s (2003) Touring “Cancer Alley” article, she states that: \n“This essay aimed to illustrate how drawing on theories and practices of performance may \nenable one to appreciate more fully the inventional possibilities of resistance” (p. 246)—\ncalling for the rhetorical application of invention to function as a site of social and political \nchange. Similarly, (lie)alectics function as stylistic possibilities of resistance by locating who \nand what needs to be resisted—especially in discourses that have been dequeerified—\nenabling readers to identify the assaultive ideologies playing out in the discourse. Ultimately, \n(lie)alectics are a rhetorical strategy implemented within discourses to disguise oppressive \nideologies, and thus, identification of these (lie)alectics provides ways to remove that \ndisguise and reveal the discourse for what it really is and what it really does—in this case \nreinforcing homophobia and heteronormativity. \nFuture research. Certainly one major question that remains is whether or not the \ntheory of (lie)alectics has applicability beyond just the rhetoric being put forth by the \nMormon Church and/or in religious discourses in general. Utilizing a similar methodology in \nterms of textual analysis has the potential to reveal whether or not these (lie)alectical \nstructures are inherent in other religious rhetoric as well as other general discourse. \nAdditionally, similar studies have the potential to determine whether or not (lie)alectics \nextend beyond being an indicator of homophobia, or if these (lie)alectical structures also \napply to other discourses of oppression of marginalized communities (i.e., race, gender, class, \n\t\t\n160 \nnationality, etc.). For example, a (lie)alectical analysis of President Trump’s border wall \nspeeches has the potential to reveal the deracialized components of his discourse and provide \na way to create counter-discourse in political resistance to the building of a border wall. A \n(lie)alectical analysis of political coverage of the #MeToo movement has the potential to \nreveal the receptiveness of this discourse and what ideological assumptions are being \nperpetuated within media representations of current social and political movements toward \nchange. \n In addition to (lie)alectics, the potential of discursive dequeerification to be utilized as \na theoretical framework is profound. Similarly to Bertand’s (2003) use of discursive \nderacialization in her interviews on place and space, dequeerification can be used by critical \nrhetoricians in similar types of studies to examine new and different ways that \ndequeerification presents itself in speech—even beyond (lie)alectics.  \nCritical Applications of Linguistics \nContributions. Certainly (lie)alectics embodies a linguistic approach to rhetorical \nanalysis, specifically a Systematic Functional Linguistics (SFL) approach (Halliday)—\nlargely utilized in Norman Fairclough’s approach to Critical Discourse Analysis. SFL takes a \nfunctional orientation to language on several levels. That is, “In general, it means that a focus \non what language does is more important than looking at how it does it (its structure)” \n(O’Donnell, 2012, p. 5). (Lie)alectics contributes a new perspective on how the function of \nlanguage can be used in social contexts to achieve particular goals. (Lie)alectics \ndemonstrates how the structure and function of language is an essential element in \nunderstanding what exactly the language is doing and how it is doing it. And the more we \n\t\t\n161 \nunderstand how a discourse accomplishes what it does, in addition to what the discourse \nactually accomplishes, the greater the potential to disrupt the impact of the discourse.  \nThe type of grammatical analysis used to identify these (lie)alectics demonstrates \nhow the rules of grammatical structures are indicative of the underlying ideologies and an \nembodiment of SFL’s assumption that “meaning implies choice” (O’Donnell, 2012, p. 5). \nEssentially, meaning is contingent upon the structure and rules of grammar and syntax in \norder for the message to have meaning (i.e., you can’t just place words in any order and have \nit make sense—have meaning). Thus, (lie)alectics demonstrates one way in which the \nsystematic rules of language can be analyzed in ways that reveal the underlying goals of the \nproducer of the discourse. \nFuture Research. While applications of linguistics have been used in CDA across \nmany disciplines, the theory of (lie)alectics can be used to expand upon linguistic theories to \nfurther investigate the relationship between language and culture. That is, (lie)alectics \nprovide a new way of conceptualizing the formations of logic through language insofar as it \ndemonstrates the way that language can be set up to appear logical—yet, only within the \ncontext of a specific constellation of beliefs. (Lie)alectics looks at the functional components \nof language (i.e., subject (noun), action (verb) etc.) and how those components work together \nto create fundamental logics that can then be identified, acting as proof of the larger \nideological system the language itself is occurring within. This type of micro-analysis creates \nadditional critical applications of linguistic analysis. \nQueer Theory \nContributions. This study contributes to Queer Theory insofar as it adds to the goal \nof Queer Theory to work as a tool to deconstruct dominant social norms reinforcing \n\t\t\n162 \nheteronormative ideals. Analyzing the role of religion, as fundamentally tied to constitutional \nrights, draws attention to the ways in which dominant heteronormative ideals are already \nbeing reinforced and the extent to which current conversations advocating for religious \nfreedoms to be redefined to limit and punish non-heterosexual practices contributes to queer \ntreatments of religious texts. Additionally, (lie)alectics as a theory contributes to applications \nof Queer Theory because it is fundamentally an identification of binaries that need to be \nproblematized and challenged. \nFuture research. The content of this research lends itself to many different potential \nstudies to be done utilizing a queer approach. Particularly for performance studies, important \nfuture research questions to ask are: How are gay Mormons performing these (lie)alectical \nidentities? Are there elements of performance that are unique to gay Mormons in comparison \nto other gay religious individuals? Queer theory also provides an autoethnographic space to \nbe explored in a larger conversation about my experiences living as a “closeted” gay \nMormon. Additionally, the conceptualization of dequeerification provides opportunities to \nqueer new spaces (i.e., identification of dequeerified speech is an act of queering). \nCritical Social Psychology \nDiscursive deracialization emerged from critical cultural psychology, and thus \ndiscursive dequeerification directly expands and builds upon the work of social psychologists \nutilizing critical approaches to examining power relationships. In the same way that \ndiscursive deracialization can be used to identify notions of new racism and post-racial \nrhetoric, so too discursive dequeerification adds to the conversation of the emergence of new \nhomophobia. Discursive deracialization has been utilized across multiple disciplines, include \n\t\t\n163 \nrhetoric, and discursive dequeerification has a similar potential to contribute to queer \napplications being utilized across the academy. \nLimitations \n One limitation of this study is that as a discourse analysis, several interactive aspects \nof this website were not examined (i.e., videos, images, web links, etc.) that leave questions \nunanswered, such as: Why where these six individuals chosen to share their stories on the \nMormon and Gay website and not others? And how might that also be a form of \ndequeerification? Additional research of the visual rhetoric on the website could expand this \nunderstanding. \n Additionally, this study was limited to studying Mormon discourse. This is in part \nbecause the theory of (lie)alectics was not fully substantiated before the reading of the \ndiscourse, and as such, there are no comparative studies. Therefore, studying one specific \nreligion (that is producing a great deal of discourse surrounding LGBTQ rights) was \nnecessary in order to demonstrate how (lie)alectics work in one context in order to be able to \ndo comparative studies. However, analyzing discourse from a single religious organization \ndoes not speak to the generalizability of (lie)alectics as a theory. Further research is needed to \nsubstantiate that generalizability, and below I provide several examples of possible \napplications of (lie)alectics in future research. \nConclusion \nThe implications of these (lie)alectical strategies to directly affect public policy \ncreates an exigence in disseminating this information to educate eligible voters about the \npotential deterioration of anti-discrimination laws in the US. Thus, this dissertation is not \ndestined to remain a manuscript on a library shelf and/or digital text on an online achieve. \n\t\t\n164 \nNor would a book—in its current form—be of much benefit to those unfamiliar with its thick \ntheoretical constructs, laden with grammatical deconstruction and discipline specific \nterminologies. For all of the useful applications of (lie)alectics and discursive \ndequeerification within academia, the specificity of this theoretical construct makes it \ndifficult to distill down into palatable consumption by my ultimate target audience: political \nforums consumed by US American voters. That is, in order for someone to understand \n(lie)alectics, they must first have some basic comprehension of dialectics. And in order for \nsomeone to understand dequeerification, they must first be acquainted with discursive \nderacialization—neither concepts recognizable to anyone I have talked to outside of scholars \nutilizing critical approaches to textual, discourse, and media analysis.  So, the question then \nbecomes, how does this work translate into something beneficial in activist spheres. It is my \nhope that this dissertation can create dialogic spaces between academics and social activists \nin reaching the audiences required to resist this rhetoric. \n\t\t\n165 \nREFERENCES \n \nAlexander, B.K.

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, sexual orientation and identity has increasingly been added to state and federal anti-discrimination laws, prompting a rhetorical situation by the Christian Right in attempts to exempt themselves from upholding anti-discrimination laws pertaining to sexual identity and orientation. This study analyzes the Mormon and Gay website—a website dedicated to advancing the position of the Mormon Church on issues of non-heterosexuality. Utilizing rhetorical textual analysis, I develop two theoretical frameworks: (lie)alectics and dequeerification to demonstrate how the discourse under examination attempts to appear non-homophobic while maintaining homophobic church doctrine. I argue that this model stands to influence the First Amendment in extending the Free Exercise clause to allow religiously-identified individuals to police and punish non-heterosexual behaviors. Additionally, this research calls for the reinforcement of the Establishment clause of the First Amendment, which restricts the federal government from establishing a national religion or to privilege one religion over another. Ultimately, this research functions as a form of activism, which highlights the discourse published on the Mormon and Gay website as discriminatory and not a step towards acceptance as it represents itself",
