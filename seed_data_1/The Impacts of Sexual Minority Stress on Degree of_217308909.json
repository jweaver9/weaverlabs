The Impacts of Sexual Minority Stress on Degree of Perceived Burdensomeness, Thwarted Belongingness, and Suicidal Ideation. Published Doctor of Philosophy dissertation, University of Northern Colorado, August 2017.  As rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicides within the sexual minority population have surpassed those of heterosexuals, it has become crucial for researchers and counseling psychologists to better understand the unique stress that sexual minority individuals experience. The present study examined the impact that sexual minority stress had on two constructs of the interpersonal theory of suicide, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, as well as on suicidal ideation among a sample of sexual minority adults (n = 197). Three multiple linear regressions were conducted to assess if the sexual minority stress constructs of sexual orientation victimization, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia had a predictive ability in the models.  Results for all three models showed that the four sexual minority stress constructs combined to help predict the degree of each thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and suicidal ideation. More specifically, results in all three models also demonstrated that of the four constructs, sexual orientation victimization and visibility management had a significant direct effect on the degree of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and suicidal ideation, respectively. In addition, two-tailed independent sample t-tests were used to examine possible differences for each sexual \tiv \tminority stress construct among lesbian and gay participants versus non-lesbian and gay participants (i.e., bisexual, asexual, pansexual, other). An unexpected result was found in that lesbian and gay participants reported being more visible in their sexual orientation than did non-lesbian and gay participants. Overall, the results provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between the sexual minority stress model and the interpersonal theory of suicide, and suggest that their integration may play an important role in assessing and understanding sexual minority suicide risk.           \tv \t   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge my Research Advisor, Dr. Rings.

Meyer (2003) further offered a conceptual framework, the Sexual Minority Stress (SMS) model, to help explain how the unique stressors that sexual minority individuals (SMIs) experience may cause or exacerbate numerous mental health problems, including increased risk of suicide. There has been growing support in the literature to illustrate that rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicides each are greater among SMIs than heterosexuals. For example, lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals reported experiencing suicidal ideation twice as often (King et al., 2008), were two to seven times more likely to attempt suicide (Haas et al., 2011), and were significantly more likely to complete suicide, all in comparison to the general population (Richardson, 1995). Despite these alarming statistics, our knowledge on the topic is limited.   Joiner (2005) presented one theory to explore some constructs perhaps related to suicide, titled the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS). Since its development, the ITS has received some empirical support among certain demographic groups such as college students (Van Orden, Witte, Gordon, Bender, & Joiner, 2008), military personnel (Bryan, Morrow, Anestis, & Joiner, 2010), prisoners (Mandracchia & Smith, 2015), and individuals suffering from chronic pain (Wilson, Kowal, Henderson, McWilliams, & \t\t2 Péloquin, 2013). There are relatively few studies, however, that have applied Joiner’s model to SMIs (e.g., Hill & Pettit, 2012; Silva, Chu, Monahan, & Joiner, 2015; Woodward, Wingate, Gray, & Pantalone, 2014), and even fewer (Baams, Grossman, & Russell, 2015; Plöderl et al., 2014) that have incorporated it with Meyer’s (2003) SMS model. Even among these studies that have done so, they have only assessed one or two of its four sources of stress constructs (i.e., experience of prejudice, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and internalized homophobia). As a result, the understanding of how sources of SMS may impact the development of suicidal ideation perhaps remains limited, making mental health prevention and intervention targeted for sexual minority suicidal ideation ill-informed.  The current study aimed to extend the literature by exploring the impacts of all four of the SMS sources of stress constructs— experience of prejudicial events, degree of rejection sensitivity, degree of visibility management, and degree of internalized homophobia experienced among SMIs on the ITS constructs that yield suicidal ideation— thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, respectively. Sexual Minority Stress Minority stress, in its general form, is a term that is not widely used; rather, it is a conclusion that has been reached by various sociological and social psychological theories (e.g., Allport, 1954; Durkheim, 1951; Pearlin, 1982; Pettigrew, 1967; Selye, 1982; Stryker & Statham, 1985). Stressors may come in the form of feeling alienated from social structures, norms, or formal institutions. Such alienation has been theorized to be a cause of suicide by social theorists such as Durkheim (1951).  \t\t3 The minority stress model has been applied to a wide range of populations such as those defined by race, ethnicity, gender, weight, and illness to name a few (Barnett & Baruch, 1987; Fife & Wright, 2000; Miller & Myers, 1998; Mirowsky & Ross, 1989; Pearlin, 1999; Swim, Hyers, Cohen, & Ferguson, 2001). For one, Meyer (2003) offered a conceptual framework building on the concept of minority stress to specifically explore the impacts that social stress from stigma, prejudice, and discrimination all have on the development and exacerbation of mental health problems, among SMIs in particular, including suicidal ideation and behaviors. Though the SMS model specifically refers to lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals when discussing sexual minorities, Meyer also acknowledged that if an individual is perceived as a sexual minority they “may suffer from stressors associated with prejudice toward LGB people (e.g., antigay violence)” (p. 6, 2003). This investigator included sexual minority identities beyond LGB in the current study, including asexual, pansexual, as well as a self-identified “other.” Stress is described in this model from various sources; Meyer included the “experience of prejudice events, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, internalized homophobia, and ameliorative coping processes” (2003, p. 3).  Sexual Minority Stress and  Suicidal Ideation  Meyer’s (2003) first SMS construct, experience of prejudice events refers to the disproportionate amount of discriminatory and violent events that SMIs have historically endured. From the enforcing of sodomy laws (Adam, 1987), to becoming targets of antigay violence (Badgett, 1995; Herek & Berrill, 1992b; Human Rights Watch, 2001), to experiencing heterosexism in the workplace (Waldo, 1999), prejudice against SMIs occurs at various levels of institutionalization. This concept also accounts for the impact \t\t4 of being victimized and the psychological distress that may result (2003). Garnets, Herek, and Levy (1990) referred to these impacts as symptoms ranging from sleep disturbances to increased use of drugs. Baams et al. (2015) found that victimization in this regard due to sexual orientation directly impacted suicidal ideation among LGB youth. Some studies even have found that SMIs who live in environments with greater social structural stigma experience higher rates of psychiatric disorders and are more likely to attempt suicide than those living in areas with lower structural stigma (e.g., Hatzenbuehler, 2010; Hatzenbuehler, 2011; Hatzenbuehler, Keyes, & Hasin, 2009; Hatzenbuehler, McLaughlin, Keyes, & Hasin, 2010).  Meyer’s (2003) next SMS construct, expectations of rejection, refers to the impact of stress from stigma. Meyer proposed that SMIs are similar to other minority groups in regards to learning that it is adaptive to anticipate, expect, and stay vigilant for negative reactions from others. The greater that one’s perceived expectation of rejection is, the greater that one’s degree of vigilance may be. This high degree of vigilance is posed to consume energy and to create conflict in one’s self-concept formation (Meyer, 2003). Expected social rejection has been found to be more predictive of psychological distress than the actual negative events themselves (Ross, 1985).  The third SMS construct of hiding and concealing refers to the decision of whether or not to disclose one’s sexual orientation (Meyer, 2003). Hiding and concealing one’s stigmatizing identity can be paradoxical in that it can be viewed as a way to protect oneself, yet such concealment can become even more stressful in the long-term (Miller & Major, 2000). Disclosure and concealment are closely related to (a) one’s fear of being discriminated against and (b) one’s desire for self-integrity (Meyer, 2003). Hiding one’s \t\t5 identity may be protective in some form; for example, concealing one’s identity may protect the individual from bullying or ostracism at school, the workplace, or even in the community.  Though not being “out” may provide some protection, it also may allow for suppressed emotions and may prevent individuals from making connections with other SMIs. Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, and Gwadz (2002) stated that for those who choose to never disclose their sexual orientation, the internal conflict between their external and internal identities might place them at greater risk for suicidal ideation.   The fourth construct of the SMS model, internalized homophobia, refers to one internally directing antigay attitudes towards oneself (Meyer, 2003). Some have theorized that internalized homophobia is a sign of a failing the coming out process (Morris, Waldo, & Rothblum, 2001), since the coming out process may be seen as a means to solidify one’s identity. Meyer (2003) further argued that internalized homophobia is never completely eliminated due to the ongoing impact of socialization and environmental factors that repeatedly expose people to anti-gay attitudes. Despite varying beliefs about the development and retention of internalized homophobia, there appears to be a general consensus on the negative impacts that it can have on the mental health of the SMI. For example, internalized homophobia has been found to significantly correlate with various mental health concerns, including depression and suicidal ideation (DiPlacido, 1998; Williamson, 2000).  These risk factor constructs of the SMS model (Meyer, 2003) are considered sources of stress that are unique to SMIs. Due to the current study’s goal to assess the impact of these constructs, and there being a lack of valid and reliable indicators to assess this construct, the protective factors associated with ameliorative coping processes were \t\t6 not considered. This practice has been utilized in other studies that have aimed to assess the impact of all, or a combination of a few sources of stress among SMIs (Baams, et al., 2015; Plöderl et al., 2014). An additional focus of this study included researching SMIs who are often left behind in the literature. Wadsworth and Hayes-Skelton (2015) noted that despite a rise in research that includes SMIs, there are relatively few studies that include bisexuals (Rust, 2002), and even fewer that include asexuals, or “other” categorized individuals. This lack of inclusion is especially disturbing due to a finding that those who identify as “other” were found to have significant disparities on measures of physical and mental health when compared to LGB and heterosexual individuals (Case et al., 2004).  Social functioning, physical functioning, and mental health were found to be significantly worse for those who identified as “other.” As there is an increase in the number of identities within the sexual minority population, as well as an increase for a rejection of labels, it was important for this investigator to consider a broader perspective when assessing for sexual orientation identity. Also, due to these disparities, it was important for this investigator to compare those who identify as “other” to those who identify as lesbian or gay. “Other” in the current study included the categories of bisexual, asexual, pansexual, and a write-in section that would include any other monikers of sexual identity.  Plöderl et al. (2014) noted that established suicide theories have yet to be applied to sexual minority research.  Their study began the process of explaining sexual minority suicide risk through the use of two established suicide models, including Joiner’s (2005) Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS). Still, that study did not incorporate all four of Meyer’s (2003) stress constructs. By incorporating all four of these stress constructs \t\t7 (experience of prejudice, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and internalized homophobia), this investigator aimed to gain a much more comprehensive understanding of the development of suicidal ideation among SMIs. It is hoped that this knowledge stands to help inform prevention and intervention approaches so that mental health professionals may become more effective in their harm risk assessment efforts when working with SMIs.   Interpersonal Theory of Suicide In an attempt to deepen understanding of some of the cognitive and theoretical underpinnings related to suicide, Joiner (2005) proposed the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS). This theory is comprised of three constructs— perceived burdensomeness (PB), thwarted belongingness (TB), and acquired capability (AC), which altogether may combine to explain the degree to which one has the ability to make a suicide attempt. According to ITS, PB is a state where the need to aid in the wellbeing of others is unmet; in other words, one believes that they are a liability on those close to them (e.g., family members, friends, etc.) (Joiner, 2005). TB on the other hand is a state that occurs when one perceives that the human need to belong is not being met. Examples of TB might include one feeling lonely, isolated, or even alienated from others. According to the ITS, PB and TB combine to account for suicidal ideation.  AC takes the theory one step further by focusing on one’s ability to truly engage in suicidal actions, such as a suicide attempt. More specifically, AC refers to how habituation to fear of death actually reduces one’s fear of death, and habituation to physical pain increases one’s tolerance to pain, again both increasing one’s capability to engage in suicidal behaviors (Van Orden et al., 2010). Joiner (2005) noted that the \t\t8 combination of high degrees of PB and TB result in suicidal ideation, with the addition of AC resulting in increased likelihood to attempt suicide. Overall, ITS is an expansion from past theorists’ perspectives on suicide; theorists such as Emile Durkheim, Edwin Schneidman, Aaron Beck, Roy Baumeister, and Marsha Linehan all played major roles in its theoretical development (Joiner, 2005). A more in-depth exploration of the ITS and its theoretical development are discussed in Chapter II.  Since the ITS was proposed, further research has provided it with some empirical support. Van Orden et al. (2008) confirmed that PB and TB, when combined, predicted suicidal ideation among college students. This same study further found that among adult outpatient clients, those who had greater degrees of AC were also found to have greater numbers of past suicide attempts. There has been good additional support for the interaction of suicidal ideation and AC in predicting suicide attempts (Bryan et al., 2010; Van Orden et al., 2008). Though there is this interaction, Van Orden et al. (2010) noted that suicidal ideation is separate from the capability to engage in suicidal behavior. Due to the focus on suicidal ideation, AC was not assessed for in this study. Perceived Burdensomeness among  Sexual Minorities  Perceived burdensomeness (PB), as previously stated, is the belief that one is a liability or a burden to others and is an ITS construct that helps to explain a portion of the development of suicidal ideation (Van Orden et al., 2010). Orbach, Gross, and Glaubman (1981) discussed the concept of PB in regards to family relationships, describing that there is a connection between suicidal threats/behaviors and a child’s perception of not meeting the demands of one’s parents. He continued to explain that those who believe \t\t9 that they are a burden and are not meeting their parents’ expectations are more likely to experience suicidal ideation. Some researchers have posed that SMIs are particularly at risk for experiencing PB. The coming out process, or the disclosure of one’s non-heterosexual identity to others, is considered a milestone in the identity development of a SMI as it represents their commitment to their identity (Clarke, Ellis, Peel, & Riggs, 2010). Revealing one’s sexual orientation may come with the possibility of believing that they are a burden on their loved ones (Silva et al., 2015). If a rejecting reaction from family and friends is perceived, the SMI may believe that they are not meeting the demands to assume certain responsibilities posed to them by their loved ones. However, if an accepting reaction from family and friends is perceived instead, the SMI may believe that they now are a burden on their loved ones. This may include the belief that loved ones would now experience more stress or negative interactions, or may even feel the burden of advocating for the “out” individual (Hilton & Szymanski, 2011).  Research exploring the potential impacts of PB on SMIs has recently begun to gain traction in the literature. For example, Silva et al. (2015) recently found PB to occur to a greater degree for undergraduate SMIs in comparison to their heterosexual peers. This same study also found that PB mediated the relationship between sexual identity and suicidal ideation for females, but not for males. In a separate study, Woodward et al. (2014) found PB to significantly predict suicidal ideation among SMIs. Baams et al. (2015) even found that the degree of anticipated or perceived rejection over one’s sexual identity was a necessary condition for PB and TB’s relation to suicidal ideation.  Other factors, including expectations of rejection and degree of visibility management, may \t\t10 have an impact on PB among SMIs.  However, such factors have been only minimally explored as of yet.  Thwarted Belongingness among  Sexual Minorities   SMIs also may face hurdles during their identity development that may contribute to possible feelings of thwarted belongingness (TB). Joiner (2005) conceptualized TB, or the unmet need to belong, as having two dimensions: (a) the lack of reciprocally caring relationships (e.g., Nobody ever helps me); and (b) loneliness (e.g., I don’t feel connected to others). These two dimensions illustrate that TB may not be only about access to social supports, but perhaps also about the quality of these relationships. One may have several people in their life, but they may not feel supported by or connected to them.   SMIs may be more likely than heterosexuals to face these two dimensions of TB as they are found to commonly experience negative interactions, discrimination (Bostwick, Boyd, Hughes, West, & McCabe, 2014), and prejudice (Clarke et al., 2010). For example, the coming out process is often a stressful experience as SMIs can be met with a wide variety of reactions that range from the extremes of total acceptance to complete rejection. Ryan, Huebner, Diaz, and Sanchez (2009) explored the impact of perceived negative reactions during the coming out process. They found the perceptions of such negative reactions to be related to future suicidal thoughts, suicidal behaviors, and engaging in high-risk sexual activity. These negative reactions may pair with the two TB dimensions– (a) lack of reciprocally caring relationships, and (b) loneliness. The SMI likely has a close relationship with someone if they are willing to disclose their status as a sexual minority to that person. A negative reaction to this disclosure, though, may lead them to perceive themselves as lacking adequate support, which could align with a \t\t11 perceived lack of reciprocally caring relationships (Van Orden et al., 2010). In addition, such a negative reaction may bring about disconnect in the relationship between the individual who came out and the person they disclosed to, which perhaps illustrates the dimension of loneliness.    There is currently little research linking TB to increased risk of suicidal ideation among SMIs, although this body of support is growing. For example, Hill and Pettit (2012) attempted to evaluate TB and PB as predictors of suicidal ideation among SMIs. They found that TB did not mediate the relationship between sexual orientation and suicidal ideation. This study comes with some criticism around its methodology. One criticism is that their sample consisted of college students, a population typically considered to be highly adept at making social connections. This may have confounded the findings due to a possible increased sense of belongingness among them. Though such studies (e.g., Hill & Pettit, 2012) have begun to explore the presence of TB among SMIs, there has yet to be an exploration that takes into account rejection sensitivity and degree of visibility management in relation to TB. The addition of these two factors may better relate to the two dimensions Van Orden et al. (2010) had originally conceptualized— (a) lack of reciprocally caring relationships, and (b) loneliness. These additions intended to allow for a focus on the quality of social support systems in the individual’s life, rather than just purely the quantity of such systems.  Statement of the Problem  For over 40 years, research has reported that SMIs are at an increased risk for suicidal ideation (e.g., Fowler et al., 1986; Haas et al., 2011; Mathy, 2002a). In fact, LGB individuals are twice as likely to report suicidal ideation (King et al., 2008), and are two \t\t12 to seven times more likely to attempt suicide (Haas et al., 2011) than are heterosexual individuals. Suicidal ideation is a relevant area of interest when considering suicidal behavior, as suicidal ideation typically precedes the making of a suicide attempt (Beck, Brown, & Steer, 1997). To gain a better understanding of what leads to elevated rates of suicidal behaviors among the sexual minority population, a continued and increasingly extensive focus on what contributes to suicidal ideation among them remains critical.  This elevated risk for suicidal behavior among SMIs has led to an increase in research aimed to explain possible contributing factors of this phenomenon (e.g., D’Augelli et al., 2005; Haas et al., 2011; King et al., 2008; Kyle, 2013). In addition, as the ITS has gained empirical support in the literature, so has the application of this theory to the sexual minority population (e.g., Hill & Pettit, 2012; Silva et al., 2015; Woodward et al., 2014). Despite this rise, there is a dearth of information regarding the impact of SMS on the ITS constructs that facilitate suicidal ideation, with relatively few studies that have just begun to explore this relationship (Baams et al., 2015; Plöderl et al., 2014). Though these studies have begun to explore this connection, they have not assessed for all four of Meyer’s (2003) SMS sources of stress. Furthermore, each examined very particular and different sexual minority groups (youth— Baams et al., 2015; German adults— Plöderl et al., 2014). An exploration of the SMS model’s impact on ITS using its four sources of stress constructs was a critical next step in the research. Greater attention to the constructs that could impact elevated risk for suicidal ideation among SMIs were expected to yield vital empirical support towards the provision of more efficient suicide prevention and intervention approaches that ultimately can save the lives of SMIs.    \t\t13 Rationale for the Study  The implications of the current study aimed to aid in the development of prevention, clinical intervention, and further theoretical understanding of suicidal ideation among SMIs. For example, Diamond et al. (2012) gathered information from the literature to better understand the unique needs of sexual minority youth (e.g., D’Augelli, 2003; Goldfried & Goldfried, 2001; Hammelman, 1993; Herdt & Koff, 2000; Hunter & Schaecher, 1987; Nadal et al., 2011; Remafedi, Farrow, & Deisher, 1991; Ryan et al., 2009; Savin-Williams, 1989). Diamond et al. (2012) implemented this information when conducting a treatment development study where they adapted the attachment-based family therapy approach for use with suicidal sexual minority adolescents. The current study has provided a clearer understanding of the possible predictive ability of the sources of stress constructs from the SMS model (Meyer, 2003) on two ITS constructs—PB and TB (Joiner, 2005). This clearer understanding of the relationship between SMS and ITS can be utilized to inform therapeutic prevention and intervention practices, which is hoped to provide a more effective way to save the lives of SMIs.  Purpose In conducting this study, the purpose was to better understand the impact of SMS on degree of suicidal ideation through the lens of ITS. By further exploring the processes of prejudicial experiences, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and internalized homophobia, the current study attempted to add to the understanding of the impact of these sources of stressors on mental health in regards to suicidal ideation. Through the addition of this empirical research with SMS and ITS, the current study could serve to increase the collective knowledge about factors that contribute to elevated \t\t14 rates of suicide among SMIs, and thus hopefully may aid in future reduction of said rates. Additionally, because this study recruited from a broad range of sexual orientation identities (e.g., asexual, pansexual), it aimed to address the scarcity of literature for SMIs who identify beyond LGB. More specifically, lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual identities were assessed, along with an option for “other” identities that was included. Recruiting from a broader range of sexual orientation identities was also appropriate due to Meyer’s acknowledgement that those who are merely perceived as sexual minorities may suffer the prejudices associated with being an SMI, even without self-identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (Meyer, 2003). One of the anticipated benefits of conducting this study was to provide a better theoretical understanding of how SMS impacts PB, TB, and overall suicidal ideation.  Another hoped benefit of this study was to aid in the development of more preventative mental health care treatments for SMIs who are experiencing the negative impacts of SMS. Lastly, by contributing to the literature, this study may indirectly aid psychological interventions in better addressing sexual minority suicidal ideation. These possible benefits directly relate to the identity of counseling psychologists as agents of change, which is part of our social justice identity (Moradi, Mohr, Worthington, & Fassinger, 2009; Motulsky, Gere, Saleem, & Trantham, 2014). As a future counseling psychologist, I this study was designed to have the possible implication to change policies and practices for a marginalized group, SMIs. This goes beyond merely having sensitivity to injustice, and into the definition of being a change agent in my social justice work (Goodman et al., 2004).   \t\t15 Research Questions The following research questions were developed in an effort to best explore the study’s aims.  The hypotheses were derived in an attempt to most accurately operationalize these research questions. Research questions 1 through 3 addressed unique versus joint explanations of variables. “Uniquely” refers the portion of variance the dependent variable (thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, suicidal ideation) is explained by one independent variable when all other independent variables are controlled for (Urdan, 2010). “Jointly” refers to amount of variance shared by the independent variables to explain the dependent variable. Research questions 4 through 4d were exploratory in nature, as a means to assess differences.  Q1  How much variance in thwarted belongingness is uniquely vs. jointly explained by the degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for sexual minority individuals?   Q2   How much variance in perceived burdensomeness is uniquely vs. jointly explained by the degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for sexual minority individuals?  Q3 How much variance in suicidal ideation is uniquely vs. jointly explained by the degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for sexual minority individuals?  Q4 To what degree are four of Meyer’s (2003) SMS constructs (prejudicial experiences, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and internalized homophobia) experienced among different sexual minority groups?  Q4a Does the degree of prejudicial experiences differ among various sexual minority identities?  Q4b Does the degree of rejection sensitivity differ among various sexual minority identities?  \t\t16 Q4c Does the degree of visibility management differ among various sexual minority identities?  Q4d Does the degree of internalized homophobia differ among various sexual minority identities?  Limitations and Delimitations  Both the SMS model (Meyer, 2003) and the ITS (Joiner, 2005) are relatively new theories. Additionally, ITS research has placed little focus on the LGB population thus far, and even less on the broader spectrum of SMIs (e.g., asexual, bisexual, etc.). Therefore, one limitation was that the theoretical bases for the present study were under-tested.   Limitations also existed in regards to the generalizability of the study.  The recruitment strategy, discussed in greater detail in Chapter III, was conducted through a national search of sexual minority organizations. Many of those who were connected with such organizations already identified as a member of the sexual minority community. As a result, those who participated may have been in a later stage of their sexual minority identity development than those who are not connected as such, making this study less generalizable. Overall, generalization of results should be taken with caution.   Another limitation of the current study included utilization of self-report surveys. With the use of self-report measures comes the possibility for participants to misunderstand some items, to respond in a biased manner (e.g., providing certain responses in an attempt to appear favorable to the researcher), and to provide subjective responses that may be prone to the limitations of memory (Groves et al., 2009).   \t\t17 Definition of Terms Sexual Minority Identities and  Sexual Minority  Stress Model:      Asexual: Defined in the current study as a sexual orientation where the individual lacks sexual attraction to anyone (Yule, Brotto, & Gorzalka, 2014), though they may desire or have romantic relationships with others.  Bisexual: Defined in the current study as a plurisexual sexual orientation (Galupo, Mitchell, & Davis, 2015) where the individual is able to form sexual and emotional attachments to those who identify as male or female (Clarke et al., 2010). Gay: Defined in the current study as a monosexual sexual orientation (Galupo et al., 2015) where men “experience their sole or primary sexual and emotional attachments to other men” (Clarke et al., 2010, p. 260). Lesbian: Defined in the current study as a monosexual sexual orientation (Galupo et al., 2015) where women “experience their sole or primary sexual and emotional attachments to other women” (Clarke et al., 2010, p. 263). Pansexual: Defined in the current study as a plurisexual sexual orientation (Galupo et al., 2015) where the individual has an “attraction that crosses all gender lines” (Smalley, Warren, & Barefoot, 2016, p. 104). Sexual Minority: Defined in the current study as any individual who identifies as non-heterosexual, such as asexual, pansexual, etc. (Woodward et al., 2014). Anytime other terms or labels are used in this dissertation (e.g., LGB, LGBTQIA) they are referring to those specific populations as used in the studies discussed.  \t\t18 Sexual Minority Stress: Refers to the stigma, prejudice, and discrimination that result in a stressful environment, leading to mental health problems in people who belong to stigmatized minority groups (Meyer, 2003).   Prejudicial Experiences: Defined in this study as discriminatory and/or violent events that sexual minority individuals have historically endured due to their sexual identity (Meyer, 2003).  Rejection Sensitivity: In the current study, rejection sensitivity refers to the sexual minority stress concept of expectation of rejection.  Rejection sensitivity is defined as “the tendency to anxiously expect to be rejected because of one’s sexual orientation” (Feinstein, Goldfried, & Davila, 2012, p. 918)   Visibility Management: Defined as regulating “disclosure for the purposes of maintaining privacy and minimizing stigma, harm, or marginalization” in regards to an invisible trait, which for the current study is sexual orientation (Lasser, Ryser, & Price, 2010a, p. 416). Internalized Homophobia: Defined in the current study as “self-directed prejudice, which is based on the individuals’ acceptance of and agreement with society’s negative evaluation of homosexuality” (Herek, Gillis, & Cogan, 2009a, p. 33).  Interpersonal Theory of Suicide: Suicidal Ideation: Reynolds operationalized suicidal ideation as a concept that ranges “from relatively mild general thoughts about death and wishes that one were dead to serious ideation about specific plans and means to taking one’s life” (1991, p. 290). \t\t19 Perceived Burdensomeness: In the current study, this refers to “the view that one’s existence burdens family, friends, and society. This view produces the idea, ‘my death will be worth more than my life to family, friends, or society’” (Joiner, 2010, p. 7).  Thwarted Belongingness: Defined as “the perception that one does not belong—the feeling that one is alienated from others and not an integral part of a family, circle of friends, or other valued group” (Joiner, 2010, p. 8).  Acquired Capability: Defined in the current study as a construct that is “composed of both increased physical pain tolerance and reduced fear of death through habituation and activation of opponent processes in response to repeated exposure to physically painful and/or fear-inducing experiences” (Van Orden et al., 2010, p. 585). Summary  The SMS model (Meyer, 2003) has offered a new understanding of the impacts of the unique stressors that SMIs may experience, and preliminarily, some of its components have been found to inter-relate with Joiner’s (2005) ITS (Plöderl et al., 2014). The current study aimed to expand on the work of Plöderl et al. (2014) and Baams et al. (2015) by incorporating all four of the SMS model’s sources of stress (prejudicial experiences, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and degree of internalized homophobia) in the examination of suicidal ideation among sexual minorities. By studying the predictive ability of these four potential sources of sexual minority stress on perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, this study aimed to provide a better understanding of the impact of SMS stress on suicidal ideation among a wide range of sexual minorities.   \t\t20 The overarching goal of this study was to provide counseling psychologists and other mental health professionals with a deeper understanding of the impact of SMS on suicidal ideation. This study added empirical evidence that has the potential to inform therapeutic prevention and intervention that addresses sexual minority suicidal ideation. It is with improved therapeutic prevention and intervention that counseling psychologists and the mental health field can begin to broach the issues of elevated risks of suicidal behaviors among SMIs, and inevitably save more lives.    \t\t21    CHAPTER II REVIEW OF LITERATURE Meyer (2003) has offered a conceptual framework, the Sexual Minority Stress (SMS) model, which was built off of the broader framework of minority stress. The SMS model helps to explain how the unique stressors that sexual minority individuals (SMIs) experience may contribute to and cause physical and mental health problems, including an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviors. This chapter provides an extensive literature review that first explains the broader framework of minority stress. Here, the theoretical background is discussed at length, highlighting the major social and social psychological theorist contributors along with the impacts of minority stress. Next, the construct formation of the SMS model will be discussed, including how the minority stress framework informed the development of the SMS model. Empirical support for the SMS model, from construct formation to current literature on the physical and mental health impact, is reviewed.  Sexual minority suicidal ideation is then reviewed, which leads into the introduction of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS; Joiner, 2005). The ITS construct formation and current empirical support across various populations are also discussed. How the ITS has been applied to SMIs and to the SMS model, specifically, is also examined at length. Finally, an extensive review of measures that have been used in the literature thus far to assess the constructs put forth is discussed.  \t\t22 One important note regarding this literature review is that there is a paucity of research conducted among SMIs who identify outside of lesbian and gay sexual orientation identities. The investigator made every effort to identify the specific population included for each study discussed. The trend that is illustrated below clearly reflects the current state of the literature, as there are several studies that included gay-identified individuals, fewer with lesbian-identified individuals (Rust, 2002), even fewer with bisexual-identified individuals, and the least with those who identified as asexual or another sexual identity (Wadsworth & Hayes-Skelton, 2015). It was the investigator’s intention to include these other identities in this study to begin the exploration of disparities that exist between lesbian/gay individuals and those who identify as other than lesbian/gay. This was important due to significant physical and mental health disparities that have been found among all SMIs (Case et al., 2004).  In addition, this was especially relevant due to the continued lack of literature around the “other” identified SMIs despite the 2009 Journal of Counseling Psychology Special Issue: Advances in Research with Sexual Minority People (ed. Tracey, 2009). This special issue brought certain methodological and conceptual challenges and opportunities when researching SMIs to the forefront (Moradi et al., 2009), yet several of the articles still had limited focus to LGB-identified individuals (e.g., Arm, Horne, & Levitt, 2009; Burkard, Knox, Hess, & Schultz, 2009; Frost & Meyer, 2009; Hamilton & Mahalik, 2009; Levitt et al., 2009; Meyer & Wilson, 2009; Sheets & Mohr, 2009; Szymanski, 2009). In addition, through having a wide inclusion of SMIs, this investigator rose up to the counseling psychologist identity as a means to advance social justice for the sexual minority population (Moradi et al., 2009). \t\t23 Minority Stress  Minority stress is a concept that refers to an expansion on general stress theory (Dohrenwend, 2000). The minority stress model specifically means to emphasize the higher levels of stress that individuals from stigmatized social groups receive due to their “minority” position in society (Meyer, 2003). Certain assumptions underlie minority stress, including that this specific stress is (a) unique, (b) chronic, and (c) socially based (Meyer, 2003). The assumption of this stress being “unique” refers to how the stress that is experienced goes beyond what general stressors are encountered by the majority group. General stress can come in many forms, for example someone may lose their job, or they may experience the death of a loved one (Meyer & Frost, 2013). An example of unique stress could be an African American male being discriminated against in his workplace because of his race. Due to this unique stress, the individuals who are members to the minority group are subject to need to adapt as a means to cope. Next is the chronic assumption, which refers to well-established and secure social and cultural structures that are in place (Meyer, 2003). Chronic stress means that the individual is being exposed on a regular basis to a stigmatizing environment, even though the people in that environment may not necessarily hold the belief. It is the social and cultural structures that reinforce the stress (Crocker, 1999). This means that the minority individual may be experiencing direct prejudice (e.g., a racist hate crime), or they may be feeling the impact of a social structure (e.g., classroom impacts on the performance of females’ math scores).  Lastly, the socially based assumption refers to the idea that minority stress does not stem from individual characteristics, such as biology or genes (Meyer, 2003). It is not \t\t24 that the individual is prone to stress, or that they have internal factors that trigger stress. Rather, minority stress comes from external factors of society, such as institutions, structures, and social processes.  Theoretical Background The minority stress model did not stem from one theory. Instead, numerous sociological and social psychological theories inferred the negative effects of stigma and prejudice on the members of minority groups (e.g., Crocker, Major, & Steele, 1998; Jones et al., 1984; Link & Phelan, 2001). Stress, alienation, and intergroup relations are major concepts that aided in the formulation of the minority stress model.  As previously mentioned, general stress theory provides the basis from which minority stress was able to expand upon (Dohrenwend, 2000). Research around traumatic events, life stressors, role strains, chronic stress, and even daily hassles have been factors considered in stress research (Dohrenwend, 1998). Before extending general stress all the way to the minority stress model, general stress theory was first expanded to social stress. Social stress provided the stepping-stone to minority stress by forming the argument that social environmental sources of stress, in addition to personal events, may lead to both mental and physical negative impacts (Meyer, 2003). This was the stepping-stone that led to the reasonable expectation that social stress may have a strong effect on those who are members of stigmatized groups.  Alienation, another major concept in the formation of minority stress, came from the contributions of social theorists (Meyer, 2003). When considering the minority stress model, alienation refers to estrangements from social norms, structures, and institutions. Durkheim (1951) brought to attention how critical the social environment was when \t\t25 considering suicide. He proposed that individuals’ use society as a basis for moral regulations, which then aids in formulating aspirations and needs. When people lack social control, and feel alienated, a sense of normlessness can set in that Durkheim referred to as “anomie,” which he proposed could lead to suicide. The role of the social environment as a possible cause of suicide highlighted the importance of alienation in the formation of the minority stress model.  One may also become alienated from society based on clashing values (Pearlin, 1982). Society may inspire, or even motivate values that conflict with the structures that are in place (Merton, 1968). Such conflict, however, is associated with minority individuals as norms, social structure, and dominant culture often do not in line with the values of minority groups (Meyer, 2003). When considering conflicts between the information given to the individual in comparison to their actual experiences, health is theorized to weaken (Moss, 1973). The conflict, or mismatch (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), described here is thought to be the essence of social stress.  Intergroup relations, and how these relations impact health stemmed from social psychological theories. To begin the discussion around social psychological theories, the concepts of social identity and self-categorization are reviewed first. Social identity and self-categorization aided in the development of the minority stress model as they provided an extension that reflects the impact of intergroup relations on the self (Meyer, 2003). It is through categorizations of groups that distinctions are made. These distinctions allow for the formation of a definition of the group, as well as the self. In addition to definitions, there is also a triggering of intergroup processes such as discrimination and competition (Turner, 1999).  \t\t26 The differing perspective to group distinctions comes in the form of social comparison and symbolic interaction theories (Stryker & Statham, 1985). These theories come with the position that the social environment provides meaning and a means of organization of experiences. Leading to the conclusion that interactions with others is necessary for the development of self, as well as health. Negative regard from others, however, is thought to lead to negative self-regard (Meyer, 2003). Comparably, the social evaluation theory (Pettigrew, 1967) provides the notion that humans learn about themselves through comparison with others. Despite which theory one sides with, symbolic interactionism or social evaluation theory, negative regard (e.g., stereotypes, prejudice) from others is suggested to result in negative psychological impact. These theoretical perspectives aided in the development of minority stress model by emphasizing the impact of negative comparisons and interactions on the self and health.  As can be seen, intergroup relations impact the health of people. Overall, healthy living is thought to stem from being in harmony with one’s environment, and it is when the individual is deprived of the harmony stress results (Selye, 1982). Pearlin (1999) discussed the concept of ambient stressors, associating such stressors with the individual’s position in society. This is tied to minority groups in that they are in a lower position in society and therefore may be exposed to ambient stressors, leading to a deprivation of harmony and results in significant stress (Clark, Anderson, Clark, & Williams, 1999).  Stress, alienation, and intergroup relation theories were united to provide the basis of minority stress (Meyer, 2003). Minority stress is not a commonly used term, is not based off of one theory, and has been inferred from social and social psychological \t\t27 theorists. The concept of minority stress has been suggested for various groups (e.g., race and ethnicity and gender; Pearlin, 1999), as well as been applied to individuals with varying stigmatized characteristics, including; people with AIDS and cancer (Fife & Wright, 2000), people who are overweight (Miller & Myers, 1998), and those with piercings or body markings (Jetten, Branscombe, Schmitt, & Spears, 2001). Thoits (1999) called for stressors associated to specific minority identities to be investigated. Impacts of Minority Stress  As previously stated, minority stress in its general form is not a commonly used term and is not considered one theory; rather it is a culmination of social and psychological theories (Meyer, 2003). Due to these circumstances, there are some limitations on finding direct impacts of minority stress beyond what is discussed in the theoretical background. What is known is that minority stress is found to cause a range of health-conditions, including various mental and physical disorders, psychological distress, and risky health behaviors (e.g., smoking) (Meyer, 2003; Meyer & Frost, 2013). Meyer and Frost (2013) also elaborate on prior studies’ findings of the psychological impact, stating that minority stress relates to various mental health problems including lowered psychological and social well-being, depressive symptoms, substance use, suicidal ideation, and suicide.  The Sexual Minority Stress Model Minority Stress and Sexual  Minority Stress  Considering the broader concept of minority stress, one major assumption is that minority stress is unique to the group that is at hand (Meyer, 2003).  As Thoits (1999) called for stressors associated with specific minority identities, Herek (2000) speculated \t\t28 that sexual prejudice that sexual minorities face is stressful and therefore could result in negative impacts on mental health (Cochran, 2001). Meyer (2003) took a distal-proximal approach to conceptualizing sexual minority stress. This approach allowed for an appropriate stress conceptualization that aligned with minority stress, as this approach takes into consideration how the individual is affected by social conditions and structures. Here the comparison to minority stress is evident, as Meyer (2003) introduced an approach that takes into consideration the subjective appraisals and perceptions of the self (proximal concept) and objective events from environmental conditions (distal concept).  Some have theorized distal-proximal concepts to be intersecting ideas, such that proximal concepts are truly subjective evaluations of, and are manifested by, the objective environment that is the distal concept (Crocker et al., 1998; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).  Meyer (2003) took a differing approach, considering minority stress processes to be along a continuum with the anchors of distal stressors (objective events) and proximal personal processes (subjective perceptions). Specifically, he suggested the continuum, from distal to proximal, includes three processes of minority stress: “a) external, objective stressful events and conditions (chronic and acute); b) expectations of such events and the vigilance this expectation requires; and c) the internalization of negative societal attitudes” (Meyer, 2003, p. 5).   Minority stress suggests that as a result of being in a minority position, members of stigmatized social categories experience excess stress that lead to negative results for the individuals (Meyer, 2003).  Sexual minority stress applies this conceptual model to a specific group of minorities, and proposes that sexual minority individuals experience more stress than heterosexuals because of the stigma, prejudice, and discrimination they \t\t29 face (Meyer & Frost, 2013). This stress may lead to mental and physical disorders, and therefore is an important area of investigation.     Minority stress constructs and the sexual minority stress model. There are three major concepts that combine to create the inferred conceptual model of minority stress: stress, alienation, and intergroup relations (Meyer, 2003). Previously, the numerous sociological and social psychologies theories and theorists were discussed in regards to their contributions in the formation of the general concept of minority stress. In applying these concepts to sexual minorities allows for a better understanding of the creation of the sexual minority stress model.   Social stress, as expanded upon from general stress, allows for the inclusion of the social environment to be a source of stress beyond what is experienced by general stressors (Meyer, 2003). This additional stress may lead to negative impacts on one’s mental and physical health. Social stress specific to sexual minority individuals may come in many forms, which range from distal to proximal sources. Distal sources include experiencing prejudice events, such as experiencing discrimination or violence (Meyer & Frost, 2013).  Lifetime perceived discrimination is considered a core stressor among many groups, including LGB individuals (Kessler, Mickelson, & Williams, 1999).  In fact, the experience of prejudicial or discriminatory events is more likely to occur among LGB individuals than heterosexuals (Harper & Schneider, 2003). Examples of prejudicial, discriminatory, or even violent events that sexual minority individuals face includes experiencing hate crimes, hearing anti-gay speech, (Hequembourg & Brallier, 2009) and facing negative treatment at work (Meyer & Frost, 2013).  Exposure to discrimination and anti-gay violence, distal sources of sexual minority stress, has been \t\t30 posited to possibly account for higher rates of psychiatric disorders and poorer mental health in sexual minority individuals (Balsam, Beauchaine, Mickey, & Rothblum, 2005; Cochran & Mays, 2000; Cochran, Sullivan, & Mays 2003; Herek, Gillis, & Cogan, 1999).  Social stress may also come from proximal sources, which Meyer (2003) conceptualized as expectations of rejection, concealment, and internalized homophobia. Expectation of rejection refers to the stress that comes from the understanding that the stigma associated with sexual minorities allows for negative societal reactions to sexual minority individuals, their relationships, and their behaviors (Herek et al., 2009a). Due to the sexual minority wanting to avoid being the target of societal reactions, they may have an expectation of possible reactions to certain situations, which may include negative reactions ranging from benevolent to hostile.  Meyer (2003) posed that sexual minority individuals adapt to stay vigilant for negative reactions, and this higher level of vigilance poses stress on the individual. Another example of a source of proximal stress includes how a sexual minority person may be exposed to societal anti-homosexual attitudes to the point where they internalize the message (internalized homophobia).  This internalization is considered a unique stressor, and may be associated with poorer health outcomes and risky behaviors among sexual minority individuals (Garnets et al., 1990; Huebner, Davis, Nemeroff, & Aiken, 2002). These examples aid in illustrating how the minority stress concept of social stress applies to sexual minority stress.   Alienation, or facing estrangement from social norms, structures, and institutions, is another major concept of minority stress (Meyer, 2003).  Sexual minority individuals experience alienation on differing levels, including the sense of normlessness or \t\t31 “anomie” posed by Durkheim (1951), as well as having clashing or conflicting values from the majority (Pearlin, 1982).  An example of sexual minority members feeling a sense of normlessness, or being abnormal, is based in the heterosexual assumption (Herek et al., 2009a). The heterosexual assumption states society has created an atmosphere where people are assumed to be heterosexual. When a sexual minority discloses their sexual orientation and is visible, they are automatically placed outside of the normal heterosexual identity and are more likely to be seen as abnormal or unnatural. Minority individuals are more likely to be subject to such conflicting, or clashing values from majority culture (Meyer, 2003).  An example of a conflicting value comes from the social climate that devalues same-sex relationships (Mohr & Fassinger, 2006), as same-sex relationships may be viewed as morally unacceptable (Mohr & Daly, 2008). Alienation is a concept from the conceptual model of minority stress that aligns well with its application to sexual minority stress model.   The last major concept from the minority stress model is intergroup relations (Meyer, 2003).  Within this concept first comes social identity and self-categorization theories, which allow for an understanding of the impact of intergroup relations on the self.  As previously mentioned, these theories allow for group distinctions to be made. While such distinctions allow for a definition of the group and self, it also triggers intergroup processes (e.g., discrimination) (Turner, 1999).  This is related to sexual minority stress in that by coming to the realization of one’s minority status, one is led to having a personal identification with that status, here being a sexual minority (Meyer & Frost, 2013).  This personal identification leads to a stressor around the perception of self as being a member of a devalued and stigmatized group (Miller & Major, 2000).   \t\t32 The next theories under the intergroup relations concept are social comparison and symbolic interaction (Stryker & Statham, 1985). These theories allow for inclusion of how social environments provide meaning in individuals’ lives. Here, interactions with others are seen as necessary for the development of self, with positive interactions resulting in well-being (Meyer, 2003).  Negative interactions with others, though, lead to negative self-regard.  These theories also align well with the idea of internalized homophobia.  Social stigma towards sexual minorities, applied here as negative interactions with others, may allow for a manifestation within a sexual minority to accept the stigma and make it a part of their own value system (Herek et al., 2009a).  This is considered to be an adaptation of one’s self to be in line with the larger society, and is seen as a negative attitude towards oneself. Internalized homophobia has been found to have negative consequences, such as a significant relationship with mental health (Meyer, 2003) and having a significant correlation to suicidal ideation (e.g., Williamson, 2000).    As this section has demonstrated, the constructs of minority stress apply well with the sexual minority population. Meyer (2003) formed a unique minority stress model that was informed by the psychological, stress, and health research of the sexual minority population. This has led to a sexual minority stress model with its own unique constructs that stem from sources of stress, including experience of prejudice, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and internalize homophobia (Meyer, 2003).  Though the SMS model has specifically referred to LGB individuals when discussing the sexual minority population, those who are perceived as sexual minorities, despite their sexual orientation identity, may still be impacted by these stressors.  \t\t33 Research Support for The Sexual  Minority Stress Model    Since its creation, the sexual minority stress model has received empirical support for its individual constructs, as well as for its entirety.  During its culmination, Meyer (2003) first utilized empirical evidence to derive the constructs of experience of prejudice, expectations of rejections, hiding and concealing, internalized homophobia, and ameliorative coping.  The following provides a condensed overview of the empirical evidence supporting the creation of each construct, the research that has supported sustaining the constructs use since its development, and finally evidence supporting the scales utilized to measure said constructs.  Construct formation for experience of prejudice events. One sexual minority stress model concept that will be explored in the current study is the experience of prejudice events (Meyer, 2003). This concept refers to the historically disproportionate rates of violent and discriminating events that sexual minority individuals have faced. Meyer (2003) proposed that the impact of being victimized, from the personal to the institutional level, impact sexual minority individuals in the form of stress and psychological distress. In the construct formation of prejudice events, there are various points of empirical support for this being a source of stress. Identified core stressors that are found to affect gay and lesbian populations include antigay violence and discrimination (Garnets et al., 1990; Hequembourg & Brallier, 2009; Herek & Berrill, 1992a; Herek et al., 1999). The literature demonstrates that the creation of gay communities leads to the increased visibility of such individuals, making members more visible as targets to violence and discrimination (e.g., Badgett, 1995; Herek & Berrill, 1992a). In fact, LGB \t\t34 individuals are found to be twice as likely to have experienced a prejudicial event in their lifetime than heterosexual individuals (Mays & Cochran, 2001).  Also, ¼ of males and 1/5 of females in a study of Sacramento LGB adults were found to have experienced some form of victimization in relation to their sexual orientation (Herek et al., 1999). LGB youth are at even greater risk of victimization, as severity of psychological consequences may be greater (Meyer, 2003). When compared to heterosexual peers, LGB youth were found more likely to be threatened, assaulted, and overall experienced more fear (Safe Schools Coalition of Washington, 1999).  Prejudice is also illustrated throughout history through the use of institutions (Meyer, 2003). Examples are seen with sodomy laws during the Nazi era that led to the punishment of sexual minorities, which ranged from imprisonment to death (Adam, 1987).  In more recent history, LGB persons experience human rights abuse all across the world that are sanctioned by their societies and governments through the laws and other formal mechanisms (Amnesty International, 2001). Support for this construct has also stemmed from discrimination that gay and lesbian individuals have faced in the workplace (Meyer, 2003).  The experience of heterosexism has been found in the workplace (Waldo, 1999), and such heterosexism has been found to relate to negative physical and psychological health. In fact, an analysis of national data revealed that gay and bisexual males earned wages that were 11 to 27% less than their heterosexual equals (Badgett, 1995). Mechanisms that have been suggested to explain the relationship between psychological distress and victimization include an interference of order and meaning of the world, as well as robbing the individual of security (Garnets et al., 1990). Symptoms related to victimization have been found to \t\t35 include: sleep disturbances (e.g., nightmares), headaches, agitation, restlessness, crying uncontrollably, substance use, and negative impacts on interpersonal relationships. Bias crimes based on antigay stigma were found to have greater impacts on mental health than similar crimes not motivated by antigay bias (Herek et al., 1999).  Current support experience of prejudice events. Beyond the construct formation, there is current empirical support for the existence of SMIs experiencing prejudice. The existence of this stress is seen in the Balsam et al. (2005) study that illustrates general victimization across one’s lifespan has been found to occur more often for SMIs than heterosexual individuals. In fact, one meta-analysis (Katz-Wise & Hyde, 2012) investigated high rates of antigay victimization and estimated that approximately 80% of LGB individuals had experienced harassment in some form across their lifespan. Experiences of prejudice at different stages of life is demonstrated across various studies that investigate victimization among sexual minority youth and adults (e.g., Baams et al., 2015; Berrill, 1992; Herek, Cogan, & Gillis, 2002; Horn, 2007; Katz-Wise & Hyde, 2012). First looking at youth experiences Horn (2007) found that in school, sexual minority youth can face victimization, exclusion, and overall unfair treatment.  In adulthood, approximately 94% of LGBs have reported facing verbal harassment that is related to their sexual orientation (Herek et al., 2002). Among adult sexual minority women, a study looking at the rates of reported harassment related to their sexual orientation found these females experienced: heterosexist name calling (45%), disapproval of roles outside of traditional female gender roles (65%), sexist comments about their clothing or bodies (61%), unfair treatment at work (39%), rejection of sexual orientation based families (36%), and being threatened sexually at least once in the past \t\t36 six months (46%) (Szymanski & Henrichs-Beck, 2014). Studies also illustrate that 17 to 28% of LGBs reported experiencing some form of physical assault and property damage related to their sexual orientation (Berrill, 1992; Katz-Wise & Hyde, 2012). These experiences of victimization have even found to be related to increase stress during the coming-out process (Baams et al., 2015). Coming out stress is positively associated with past experiences of actual or expected negative reactions from loved ones (e.g., friends, peers, and family). A 2011 federal report (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2011) revealed that between 1998 and 2011, there had been over 15,000 federally reported hate crimes against SMIs in the United States (U.S), which made sexual orientation the second most frequent type of hate crime after race. This report also revealed that hate crimes decreased from 2010 to 2011 for religious, racial, and ethnic groups, while sexual orientation based hate crimes increased. This finding illustrates that sexual minorities are the only group assessed by the U.S. Department of Justice to have a rise in reported victimization during this time period. This federal report demonstrates that SMIs continually experience significant prejudice through victimization, and it has been considered an increasingly serious issue in recent years.    Some environments are found to be more stigmatizing towards LGBs than others, through discriminating social policies and a lack of pro-sexual minority organizations (Lick, Tornello, Riskind, Schmidt, & Patterson, 2012). LGBs who live in an environment that is rich in stigma are found to experience particularly high rates of interpersonal stigma (Lick et al., 2012) and victimization (Herek, Chopp, & Strohl, 2007). SMIs have also been found to frequently face discrete moments of discrimination and prejudice \t\t37 (Katz-Wise & Hyde, 2012). From the stigma-rich environments to discrete moments of discrimination and prejudice, such experiences have been found to relate to greater psychological distress than those who are not in such environments (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2009; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2010; Mays & Cochran, 2001; Meyer, 2003). Investigations into stigmatizing environments have also revealed some of the impacts of public debates around marriage benefits for LGBs (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2010; Riggle, Rostosky, & Horne, 2010; Riggle, Thomas, & Rostosky, 2005). They found that these debates are associated with higher levels of distress (e.g., mood, anxiety, and substance use) among LGBs. The higher level of distress is possibly due to the content of these debates that may characterize SMIs as immoral, non-committed, and promiscuous.  Overall, the empirical support discussed in this section demonstrates the experience of prejudice that SMIs face. Prejudice comes in many forms, from discrete interpersonal interactions, verbal harassment, and physical assault, to stigma-rich environments that promote anti-gay rhetoric. Prejudice has been found to have various forms of negative impacts, and will be discussed at the end of this section.  Construct formation for expectations of rejection. Expectations of rejection is another construct from Meyer’s sexual minority stress model (2003), which refers to the tendency for sexual minority individuals to adapt to anticipate, expect, and stay vigilant for rejecting reactions from others. Meyer proposed that the greater the perceived expectation of rejection, the greater energy that is spent. The construct formation of expectation of rejection notes anxiety that occurs when a member of a stigmatized group interacts with society (Goffman, 1963). Vigilance is cited as a defense mechanism for those who are targeted for prejudice (Allport, 1954). \t\t38 Sexual minority individuals are found to adapt to maintain a chronic state of vigilance as a way to defend themselves against possible discrimination and violence from members of the majority culture (Crocker et al., 1998; Meyer, 2003). Meyer (2003) noted that unlike prejudice events, it is not necessary for a concrete offense (e.g., being fired from a job) to occur in order for a minority individual to experience the impact of vigilance from expectations of rejection.   The result of vigilance includes a conflict between self-concept and other-perceptions, which is considered to take a great amount of energy as a means to attempt to stay stable and coherent all while increasing the individual’s perception of other’s as stigmatizing (Meyer, 2003). Evidence for the impact of stigma on health was found in Ross’s (1985) cross-cultural study on gay men, where he found that the anticipation of social rejection was more predictive than actual negative events for psychological distress. Expectations of societal stigma has also been found to impede on academic and social functioning of the stigmatized individual (Crocker et al., 1998; Pinel, 2002; Steele, 1997).  Current support for expectations of rejection. Beyond the construct formation, there is current empirical support for the existence of SMIs having an expectation for rejection. Studies have illustrated that experiencing antigay victimization leads to increased vigilance to threats in the environments of LGBs (Lick, Durso, & Johnson, 2013; Pachankis, Goldfried, & Ramrattan, 2008).  Baams et al. (2015) even discussed the relationship among experiencing prejudice and victimization with an increase in stress and a possible increase in the expectation of negative interactions. Specifically, they \t\t39 found that coming out stress is positively associated with past experiences of actual, or even expected negative reactions from loved ones (e.g., friends, peers, and family).   SMIs are posited to also be prone to rejection sensitivity as a result of experiencing prejudice, which has been demonstrated to be a significant area of stress for SMIs (e.g., Baams et al., 2015; Berrill, 1992; Herek et al., 2002; Horn, 2007; Katz-Wise & Hyde, 2012). Being persistently exposed to anxiety provoking events is suggested to force SMIs to remain in a vigilant state of mind as a means to stay safe (Szymanski & Sung, 2010), which is a state that is related to negative health outcomes (Schnittker & McLeod, 2005). This rejection sensitivity was found to have a relationship with physiological dysfunction and poor health outcomes.  Overall, the empirical support discussed in this section illustrates a relationship between experiencing prejudice and an increase in expectations of rejection. Considering the vast amount of support presented on SMIs experiencing prejudice, the addition of this literature demonstrates that SMIs likely face stigmatizing experiences that place them in a persistent state of vigilance. Expectations of rejection has been found to have various forms of negative impacts, and they will be discussed at the end of this section.  Construct formation for hiding and concealing. The act of hiding and concealing one’s sexual orientation identity, one of the concepts of the sexual minority stress model (Meyer, 2003), refers to the stress of having an invisible minority identity. Miller and Major (2000) referred to revealing or concealing one’s identity to be a stress-inducing paradox. Specifically, the act of hiding one’s identity can be a means to protect themselves against rejection or discrimination (2003), yet the act of hiding one’s identity can become even more stressful over time.  \t\t40  In the concept formation of the hiding and concealing construct of the sexual minority stress model, Meyer (2003) noted the movement towards the proximal classification on the continuum. As seen in other stigmatized groups, concealing the part of one’s identity that is stigmatizing is found to have a cognitive burden of constantly being preoccupied with the act of hiding (Smart & Wegner, 2000). Sexual minorities may hide their sexual orientation for many reasons that range from shame to fear of real harm and discrimination (D’Augelli & Grossman, 2001). Hiding and concealing one’s sexual orientation is found to be a coping strategy common among sexual minority adolescents (Hetrick & Martin, 1987), and is seen as an important source of stress for all sexual minorities (DiPlacido, 1998). Hiding and concealing can come in many different forms, from trying to pass as a heterosexual, to trying to cover by hiding clues about one identity (Meyer, 2003).  Outness may also include being out implicitly, which is being truthful without the use of explicit language, to being out explicitly (Croteau, 1996).  Disclosing important aspects of one’s identity has been found to be an important factor in physical and mental health maintenance (Pennebaker, 1995). Expressions of traumatic events or characteristics are related to reduced anxiety and foster an assimilation with the respective characteristics, while suppression has been found to have a relationship with negative impacts on health (Bucci, 1995; Stiles, 1995). An example of this is seen in the progression of HIV in gay men, which was found to progress more rapidly for those who were hiding their sexual minority status (Cole, Kemeny, Taylor, & Visscher, 1996). Hiding and concealing one’s identity is also posited to prevent sexual minority persons from finding a sense of community (Meyer, 2003). This is important to \t\t41 note, as positive group affiliation has been found to have positive results on one’s self-esteem (Crocker & Major, 1989).   Current support for hiding and concealing. Beyond the construct formation, there is current empirical support for the existence of hiding and concealing sexual orientation identities among SMIs. As previously discussed, SMIs were found to experience victimization and harassment due to their sexual orientation (e.g., Berrill, 1992; FBI, 2011; Herek et al., 2002; Horn, 2007; Katz-Wise & Hyde, 2012; Szymanski & Henrichs-Beck, 2014) especially in more stigmatizing environments (Herek et al., 2007; Lick et al., 2012).  As a means to prevent future victimization, some SMIs conceal their identity (Pachankis, 2007) especially in stigma-rich environments. Concealing one’s sexual orientation does serve as a positive coping strategy, but only for the short-term by avoiding further victimization (Jones et al., 1984). Concealing one’s identity, however, is also associated with negative long-term consequences, such as: lower self-esteem (Frable, Wortman, & Joseph, 1997), anxiety and negative affect (Frable, Platt, & Hoey, 1998), and depressive symptoms (Frost & Bastone, 2008; Frost, Parsons, & Nanin, 2007). Overall, these findings demonstrate that SMIs may be subjected to frequent prejudicial experiences that lead to them concealing their sexual orientation to remain safe in the short-term (Lick et al., 2013). SMI’s long-term health, however, is at risk to suffer negative consequences. Hiding and concealing has been found to have negative long-term impacts for SMIs, and will be discussed in depth at the end of this section.  Construct formation for internalized homophobia. Internalized homophobia is another concept of the sexual minority stress model and is considered to be the most internal and insidious, and therefore proximal of the constructs (Meyer, 2003). This \t\t42 construct refers to an internal stressor where one directs antigay attitudes towards themselves (Herek et al., 2009a). This stressor is of great importance, as it refers to the negative perception one has of themselves due to the impact of societal and environmental messages around sexual minorities.   Definitions of internalized homophobia have also included the idea that negative attitudes towards oneself leads to a personal devaluation (Meyer & Dean, 1998). When considering the development of sexual orientation identity, it was posited that as one accepts their sexual orientation they may begin a coming out process (Meyer, 2003). Though an ideal coming out process results in a healthy identity development (Troiden, 1989), an unsuccessful process may relate to internalized homophobia where the individual was unable to overcome the stigmatizing societal messages (Morris et al., 2001).  Internalized homophobia is also posed to be a threat that never ceases, despite how well someone has accepted their identity due to the chronic exposure to antigay attitudes (Meyer, 2003). Internalized homophobia has been found to significantly correlate with mental health, including depression, anxiety, substance use, and suicidal ideation (DiPlacido, 1998; Meyer & Dean, 1998; Williamson, 2000), as well as relates to strains in sexual functioning and intimate relationships (Meyer & Dean, 1998).  Current support for internalized homophobia. Beyond the construct formation, there is current empirical support for the existence of internalized homophobia as a stressor among SMIs. The prejudice and discrimination that SMIs have been found to face in their lifetime (Berrill, 1992; FBI, 2011; Herek et al., 2002; Horn, 2007; Katz-Wise & Hyde, 2012; Szymanski & Henrichs-Beck, 2014) has also been found to have a relationship with internalized homophobia. Antigay stigma that LGBs may experience is \t\t43 suggested to lead to mental health disparities (Brewster et al., 2015; Brewster & Moradi, 2010; Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Meyer, 2003), including internalized homophobia (Meyer, 2003). Internalized homophobia has been found to occur among various sexual minority identities, including those who identify as lesbian, gay, and bisexual (e.g., Baams et al., 2015; Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Jorm, Korten, Rodgers, Jacomb, & Christensen, 2002; Kuyper & Fokkema, 2010; Rosario et al., 2002; Szymanski & Henrichs-Beck, 2014).  Studies have found that higher internalized homophobia is associated with poorer relationship qualities (Cohen & Byers, 2015), and has been found to be predictive of psychological distress (Szymanski & Henrichs-Beck, 2014). In fact, in a sample of sexual minority females (2014), internalized homophobia was also found to be associated with other forms of internalized stressors, including: attempts to become more attracted to the opposite sex (24%), attempts to stop same-sex attraction (22%), being bothered by other females being present (26%), and forming beliefs that females are too easily offended (19%). Internalized homophobia was also positively associated with greater odds of suicide attempts (Livingston, Heck, Gleason, Oost, & Cochran, 2015).  Experiencing stigmatizing environments and receiving antigay messages may lead to an internalization of these messages among SMIs. Overall, the findings discussed above demonstrate that not only do SMIs experience internalized homophobia, but they also are associated with negative mental health impacts. Internalized homophobia’s negative impacts will be discussed in depth at the end of this section.  Construct formation for ameliorative coping processes. The last construct of the sexual minority stress model (Meyer, 2003) is ameliorative coping processes. This construct differs from the other constructs in that it is not a source of stress; rather it is a \t\t44 set of strategies used in order to make the stress easier to bear. Minority individuals have been posited to respond to prejudice with positive coping, as well as resilience (Allport, 1954; Clark et al., 1999). The literature supports that minority individuals do face stress, but such status is also associated with group cohesion that acts as a buffer for protection from the negative impact on mental health that comes from minority stress (Clark et al., 1999; Crocker & Major, 1989; Miller & Major, 2000). LGB individuals were found to offset minority stress by forming a different set of values and structures that allow for their group to be enhanced (Crocker & Major, 1989). Also found was the impact of familial support, which Hershberger and D’Augelli (1995) noted aids in self-acceptance and counters the harmful effect on mental health for LGB adolescents.   Coping mechanisms, resilience, and hardiness have been found to be personal strategies for LGB individuals’ ability to manage general and minority stress (Masten, 2001). What is focused on more for this construct, however, is the impact of group affiliation (Meyer, 2003). Minority group membership has been found to serve two coping functions (Jones et al., 1984). The first function is that the group allows the individual to experience an environment where others do not stigmatize them.  The second function is that the group is able to support one another around the negative evaluations that society places on them.  Overall, group membership allows for reappraisal of oneself, which in turn validates the minority individual (Thoits, 1985). Current support for ameliorative coping processes. Beyond the construct formation, there is current empirical support for the existence of ameliorative coping processes among SMIs. For example, females in long-term romantic relationships who reported higher degrees of relationship satisfaction report increased rates of sexual \t\t45 functioning across cognitive-affective, motivational, and behavioral domains (Cohen & Byers, 2015). Wong, Schrager, Holloway, Meyer, and Kipke (2013) found, in their unique sample of African American males who have sex with males from House and Ball communities, that greater support reduced the effects of distal minority stress. Connection with social networks appeared to significantly reduce gay-identified stress.  These studies illustrate that positive group membership, including having supportive and satisfying romantic relationships, have positive impacts on SMIs.  The risk factor constructs of SMS are considered sources of stress that are unique to SMIs, including: experience of prejudice, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and internalized homophobia. The current study’s goal was to assess the impact of these sources of stress posed by SMS (Meyer, 2003) on the degree of thwarted belongingness (TB; Joiner, 2005), perceived burdensomeness (PB), and suicidal ideation. Due to this focus on SMS’s risk factor constructs, the protective factors associated with ameliorative coping processes were not used.  This practice has been utilized in other studies that have aimed to assess the impact of all, or a combination of a few sources of stress among SMIs (Baams et al., 2015; Plöderl et al., 2014). As most existing studies assess one or two of the factors posed by the SMS model, there is a limited understanding of how sexual minorities actually develop their increased risk of suicide (Plöderl et al., 2014). The current study aimed to utilize all four of the SMS model’s sources of stress in its examination of suicidal ideation among SMIs as a means to possibly increase the understanding of the development of suicide risk in this population.    \t\t46 Impacts of Sexual Minority Stress  Physical health impacts. Studies investigating the impacts of the sexual minority stress model (SMS; Meyer, 2003) on SMIs have found that physical and mental health are negatively affected by these unique sources of stress (Eaton, 2014; Meyer, 1995, 2003; Meyer & Frost, 2013; Mohr & Sarno, 2016). Predictions of the deleterious impacts of these stressors have been supported by empirical studies (e.g., Hatzenbuehler, 2011; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2010; Mays & Cochran, 2001; McLaughlin, Hatzenbuehler, & Keyes, 2010). For example, sexual minority adults who reported higher rates of SMS (e.g., discrimination, rejection, internalized homophobia, and hiding their identity) also reported more total physical health issues than those who reported lower rates of SMS (Frost, Lehavot, & Meyer, 2011). In fact, Denton (2012) found among gay males and lesbians that experiences of prejudice, expectations of rejection, and internalized homophobia were predictive of the severity of their physical symptoms. Gay and lesbian-identified individuals face these health issues, which puts the further disparity in mental and physical health that is found in those who identify as other than LGB into better perspective (Case et al., 2004). Social functioning, physical functioning, and mental health were found to be significantly worse for those who identified as other. As there is an increase of identities within the sexual minority population, as well as an increase for a rejection of labels, it is important to consider a broader perspective when assessing for sexual orientation identity. Also, due to these disparities, it is important to compare those who identify as “other” to those who identify as lesbian or gay.  Other studies have demonstrated a relationship between SMS and physical health problems, ranging from headaches and increased symptom severity to disabilities and \t\t47 chronic diseases (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Kim, & Barkan, 2012; Frost et al., 2011; Woodford, Howell, Kulick, & Silverschanz, 2012). Several studies on HIV-positive gay males have even revealed an association between physical health outcomes and hiding one’s sexual orientation. Specifically, hiding and concealing one’s sexual orientation was linked to increased diagnoses of disrupted immune function (Cole, Kemeny, & Taylor, 1997), infectious diseases and cancer (Cole et al., 1996), and death (Cole et al., 1997). Sexual orientation victimization is also associated with psychological distress, and is further thought to aid in the explanation of physical health disparities among LGBs (Pascoe & Smart-Richman, 2009) due to general stress being associated with poor physical health in the general population (McEwen, 2006; Seeman, Singer, Rowe, Horwitz, & McEwen, 1997). Mental health impacts. SMS has also been found to have negative impacts on SMI’s mental health (Dewaele, Van Houtte, & Vincke, 2014; Meyer, Schwartz, & Frost, 2008). The SMS model in general has received support as a framework for understanding mental health disparities among SMIs (DiPlacido, 1998; Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Kimmel & Mahalik, 2005; Kuyper & Fokkema, 2010; Lehavot & Simoni, 2011; Liao, Kashubeck-West, Weng, & Deitz, 2015; Lick et al., 2013; Meyer, 2003). In one study (Meyer, 1995) of gay males, those with greater SMS were three times more likely to have a higher degree of psychological distress (e.g., hopelessness, anxiety) than those reporting lower SMS. These mental health disparities also accounted for higher odds of generalized anxiety and major depression (Cochran et al., 2003; Gilman, Cochran, Mays, Ostrow, & Kessler, 2001). Researchers have also suggested that SMS may account for the differences in mental health disparities seen among SMIs (Hatzenbuehler, Corbin, & \t\t48 Fromme, 2008; Lewis, 2009). This difference is illustrated in a study by Mays and Cochran (2001), who found that not only did LGBs report more victimization than heterosexual individuals, but victimization also fully mediated the relationship between psychological distress and sexual orientation.  When considering the constructs of SMS, higher rates of mental health disorders among SMIs has been linked to both distal and proximal stressors (e.g., Cox, Dewaele, Van Houtte, & Vincke, 2011; D’Augelli, Pilkington, & Hershberger, 2002; Meyer, 2003). An example of this is seen with the SMS proximal source of stress—internalized homophobia, as it was linked with psychological distress among sexual minority females (Szymanski, Dunn, & Ikizler, 2014; Szymanski & Henrichs-Beck, 2014). Hiding and concealing one’s sexual identity, another proximal source of stress, has been linked to short-term positive impacts by avoiding victimization (Jones et al., 1984), but also with long-term consequences ranging from increased anxiety, depressive symptoms, negative affect, low self-esteem, and psychological strain (Frable et al., 1998; Frable et al., 1997; Frost & Bastone, 2008; Frost et al., 2007). Distal sources of stress were found to be reported more frequently in stigmatizing environments (Lick et al., 2012; Oswald, Cuthbertson, Lazarevic, & Goldberg, 2010). Highly stigmatizing environments have also been associated with increased rates of psychological symptoms including depression, negative affect, and suicide attempts (Goldberg & Smith, 2011; Hatzenbuehler, 2011; Lick et al., 2012). Sutter and Perrin (2016) even found that LGBTQ-based discrimination had an indirect effect on increased suicidal ideation among SMIs.  Suicidal ideation and behaviors. The deleterious impacts of SMS found on mental health among LGB individuals include an association with increased suicidal \t\t49 ideation (Plöderl et al., 2014). Suicide attempts are also a relevant area of discussion when considering suicidal ideation, as suicidal ideation typically precedes the making of a suicide attempt (Beck et al., 1997). SMS is suggested to account for mental health disparities among SMIs that include an increased risk for attempting and completing suicide (Cochran & Mays, 2000; Garofalo, Wolf, Wissow, Woods, & Goodman, 1999; Hatzenbuehler, 2011; Richardson, 1995). In fact, sexual minority young adults and adolescents who have made a suicide attempt were found to report higher rates of gay specific stressors, and no difference in non-gay specific stress when compared to SMIs who had not attempted suicide (Rotheram-Borus, Hunter, & Rosario, 1994; Silva et al., 2015).  Examining the constructs of SMS reveal that experiences of prejudice include experiencing victimization, which has been linked to attempting suicide (Livingston et al., 2015). More specifically, for every one-unit increase of reported lifetime victimization, the odds for a suicide attempt increased by 2.92. Another study proposed that the effects victimization accumulate to begin a series of negative projecting signs including risky sexual behavior, substance use, and psychological distress, which combined to increase the SMI’s risk for suicide (Mustanski, Andrews, Herrick, Stall, & Schnarrs, 2014). When taking ameliorative coping processes into consideration, however, SMIs who have adaptive responses are found to have fewer suicide attempts than those without adaptive response (Livingston et al., 2015).  When looking at the thought processes preceding suicide attempts, the sources of stress posed by SMS have been found to have an association with suicidal ideation. One study (Plöderl et al., 2014) examined the impact of hiding and concealing one’s sexual on \t\t50 degree of suicidal ideation. They found that degree of openness about one’s sexual identity served as a protective factor against suicidal ideation, as those who were more open experienced less internalized homophobia and more support than those who were less open about their sexual identity. In addition, internalized homophobia was found to significantly and directly correlate with suicidal ideation. Overall, suicidal ideation is considered to be one of the major negative impacts of SMS, as SMIs are found to have higher degrees of suicidal ideation than heterosexual individuals (Plöderl et al., 2014). Sexual Minority Suicidal Ideation  There is growing empirical support demonstrating elevated rates of suicidal ideation among LGB individuals (Mathy, 2002b; Silva et al., 2015). For example, studies have illustrated that suicidal ideation rates are two to three times higher among SMIs than heterosexual individuals (King et al., 2008; Livingston et al., 2015; Silenzio, Pena, Duberstein, Cerel, & Knox, 2007). These elevated rates were still present even when race, age, and gender are controlled for (Silenzio et al., 2007).   Specific demographic differences across SMIs have been investigated to assess possible differences within this population. One study researched suicidal ideation in relation to the coming out process, and findings around coming out were mixed (Plöderl et al., 2014). Specifically, disclosing one’s sexual orientation identity was found to increase the risk for suicide attempts in one’s lifetime, yet decrease the current risk for suicidal ideation. This mixed finding was suggested by the authors to be due to the combination of increased risk factors of experiencing prejudice after coming out, and the protective factors through the possibility of increased social support. \t\t51 Researchers also examined SMIs’ personality traits in relation to proneness to suicidal ideation, which has revealed a connection between extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness among LGBs and suicidal ideation (Cramer, Stroud, Fraser, & Graham, 2014). Studies investigating sex demographics have found that sexual minority females have an elevated risk for suicidal ideation when compared to sexual minority males (Garcia, Adams, Friedman, & East, 2002). These findings differ when looking at sexual minority adolescents, however, as males were found to have higher rates of depression and suicidal ideation than females (Russell, Ryan, Toomey, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2011).  Further explorations among sexual minority youth have revealed that disclosing one’s identity is often associated with higher levels of stress, which is found to have a relationship with higher degree of depression and suicidal ideation (Baams et al., 2015; Cochran et al., 2003; Meyer, 2003).   The elevated rates of suicidal ideation among SMIs have been found to vary across differing demographics, such as between males and females (Garcia et al., 2002; Russell et al., 2011), across age of coming out (D’Augelli et al., 2005; Remafedi et al., 1991; Wichstrom & Hegna, 2003) as well as across the differing sexual orientations (e.g., bisexuals, lesbians, and gays) (Plöderl et al., 2014). Though these rates do vary slightly, what is consistently found is that among all subgroups of sexual orientation identities (e.g., gays, lesbians, bisexuals), SMIs are found to have increased risk for all forms of suicidality (e.g., suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, etc.) (Bagley & Tremblay, 2000; Haas et al., 2011; King et al., 2008; Lewis, 2009; Marshal et al., 2011; Meyer, 2003; Plöderl et al., 2014; Plöderl, Sauer, & Fartacek, 2006; Russell, 2003).   \t\t52 Interpersonal Theory of Suicide Joiner (2005) proposed the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS) in an attempt to deepen the understanding of some of the cognitive and theoretical underpinnings related to suicide. This theory is comprised of three constructs— perceived burdensomeness (PB), thwarted belongingness (TB), and acquired capability (AC), which altogether may combine to explain the degree to which one has the ability to make a suicide attempt. Joiner (2005) was influenced by several theorists in his formation of the interpersonal theory of suicide (ITS). PB, one of the constructs of ITS that helps explain the desire for suicide (Van Orden et al., 2010), was a dependent variable for the current study. PB is a belief that one is a burden on those who they are close to, such as family members or close friends. TB is the second construct of the ITS that aids in the explanation for the desire of suicide (Van Orden et al., 2010), and was another dependent variable for the current study. TB is based off a feeling of an unmet need to belong; especially feeling alienated from groups the individual values most (Joiner, 2010). AC is the last construct of the ITS, and is considered one’s ability to truly engage in suicidal action, such as a suicide attempt. AC takes into consideration how habituation to death and physical pain reduces one’s fear of death and increases pain tolerance, which is posed to increase one’s capability to engage in suicidal behaviors (Van Orden et al., 2010).  Construct Formation for the  Interpersonal Theory  of Suicide  One of the first influencers of the ITS to discuss is Emile Durkheim, who emphasized less of the individual and more of the collective social forces on suicide (Durkheim, 1897). Durkheim’s theory discusses four different kinds of suicide. Joiner \t\t53 (2005) focused on the first two kinds of suicide that are embedded in social integration, where the individual either has too much or too little. Joiner’s thwarted belongingness (TB) is similar to having too little social integration, as it results in people feeling as though they have no purpose. Such feelings may lead to what Durkheim (1897) referred to as an egoistic type of suicide. Too much social integration poses some similarities to PB. Here, the individual is lost in society and has reached a point of self-sacrificing in the groups best interest. This is known as the altruistic suicide.  Edwin Shneidman’s (1996) work is also significant for Joiner’s (2005) development of the ITS. Shneidman centered on psychological needs not being met, which results in an intolerable general emotional and psychological pain called psychache. The pain of a psychache is theorized to lead to suicide. Shneidman’s (1996) theory however, deems a broad range of needs that are thwarted in order to develop a psychache. Joiner further developed on the idea of psychache, stating that it is a result of perceived burdensomeness (PB) combined with TB. Beck and colleague’s (Beck, Steer, Kovacs, & Garrison 1985) work introduced a concept similar to psychache, which Beck called hopelessness. Hopelessness involves negative thoughts and thinking styles at the forefront of risk for suicide. Joiner’s (2005) work takes the concept of hopelessness and expands on it by stating that hopelessness is truly about PB and TB.  Shneidman (1996) and Beck (1996) also introduced the concepts that further deepen the understanding of acting on suicidal thoughts. Joiner’s (2005) concept of habituation stemmed from Beck’s (1996) cognitive sensitization. Cognitive sensitization presents repetitive suicidal thoughts resulting in a more easily triggered thought process as with repetition comes a more accessible thought process, which leads to such thoughts \t\t54 increasing in severity. Habituation, on the other hand, takes a more narrowed focus on this concept. Habituation is specific to fear and pain that would be involved in self-injury. Becoming used to this fear and pain leads to more serious suicidality. Shneidman’s (1996) work elaborated on how lethality is a necessary factor in serious suicidality. Joiner linked lethality to the ITS in the development of acquired capability (AC). Just as a psychache cannot stand alone in understanding suicide, neither can PB and TB. AC, which is an expansion off of cognitive sensitization and lethality, is a necessary component that takes suicide from ideation to a possible attempt (2005).  Next to consider is Roy Baumeister’s (1990) work around suicide, which culminated to produce the Escape Theory of Suicidal Behavior (Joiner, 2005). Within this theory are two major steps that are associated with the ITS. The first step of this theory occurs when expectation and reality are severely negatively discrepant. Joiner’s concepts of PB and TB are ones that relate to the disappointed expectations that is a product of Baumeister’s (1990) work. The last step in escape theory occurs when individuals utilize cognitive destruction to escape. Joiner claims this to be connected to the development of AC (2005). Lastly, Joiner discussed Marsha Linehan’s (1993) emotional dysregulation as a principal source contributing to AC (Joiner, 2005). Emotional dysregulation occurs when there is self-injury as an attempt to regulate one’s emotions, as this reflects a lack of adaptive means to regulate one’s emotions.  Research Support for the  Interpersonal Theory  of Suicide   Since the ITS’s (Joiner, 2005) development, it has received empirical support across certain populations, such as college students (Van Orden et al., 2008), military \t\t55 members (Bryan et al., 2010), prison inmates (Mandracchia & Smith, 2015), persons suffering from anorexia (Holm-Denoma et al., 2008), and chronic pain patients (Wilson et al., 2013). The three major constructs of the ITS include PB, TB, and AC. When considering PB’s relation to suicidal ideation, researchers have found that PB was a strong predictor of current suicidal ideation (Van Orden et al., 2008), even after controlling for hopelessness (Van Orden, Lynam, Hollar, & Joiner, 2006).  TB, the second construct of the ITS, was conceptualized by Joiner (2005) to have two dimensions: (a) the lack of reciprocally caring relationships (e.g., nobody ever helps me) and (b) loneliness (e.g., I don’t feel connected to others). Social isolation, which is considered to have loneliness and lack of reciprocally caring relationships as facets, has been considered one of the strongest and most reliable risk factors that predict suicidal ideation and other suicidal behaviors across various demographics (Conwell, 1997; Dervic, Brent & Oquendo, 2008; Joiner, 2005; Joiner & Van Orden, 2008; Trout, 1980; Van Orden et al., 2010). Empirical support for TB has also been found in assorted studies, such as in a study among Norwegian mothers that found those with more children have lower rates of suicide when compared with those who had less children (Hoyer & Lund, 1993). Another source of support was found in a twin study that illustrated that despite higher rates of mental disorders, twins had lower rates of suicide that is suggested to be due to their sense of belongingness as a twin (Tomassini, Juel, Holm, Skytthe, & Christensen, 2003). Also, during times when people come together due to celebrations (Joiner, Hollar, & Van Orden, 2006) or even times of hardship (Biller, 1977), suicide rates are shown to go down. PB and TB have been found to be proximal causes for suicidal ideation and are \t\t56 considered related, but distinct constructs (Van Orden, Cukrowicz, Witte, & Joiner, 2012). Taking the step from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt, AC has received support in various forms ranging from anecdotes to empirical studies (Joiner et al., 2005). The AC construct refers to the habituation to death and pain, which is thought to decrease fear and increase pain tolerance, increasing likelihood to complete suicide (Joiner, 2005). For example, even after controlling for a multitude of other variables among four separate samples consisting of a diverse array of individuals (from Brazilian psychiatric patients to U.S. undergraduate students) there was still an obvious association between past and future suicidality (Joiner et al., 2005; Joiner et al., 2003). Another example includes an examination of those with a history of suicide attempts, who have been found to have higher pain tolerance, and therefore are considered more habituated to pain (Orbach et al., 1996).  Lethal suicidal behavior among adolescents (Kotila & Lönnqvist, 1987) and adults (Christiansen & Jensen, 2007; Haw, Bergen, Casey, & Hawton, 2007; Zonda, 2006) has been found to be predicted by multiple past suicide attempts. Van Orden et al. (2008) found that in a sample of outpatient individuals the number of suicide attempts and one’s degree of AC are associated, and those with multiple past attempts were found to have the highest degree of AC. In addition, they also found in a separate study that AC scores and PB scores predicted degree of suicide risk (2008). There has been good support for the interaction of suicidal ideation and AC acting as predictors of suicide attempts (Bryan et al., 2010; Van Orden et al., 2008). Though there is this demonstrated interaction, suicidal ideation has been found to be separate and distinct from capability to \t\t57 engage in suicidal behavior (Van Orden et al., 2010). Due to the current study’s focus on suicidal ideation, and not on suicide attempts, AC was not assessed for in this study.  Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and Sexual Minorities  As illustrated above, empirical support for the ITS is robust in nature across various populations (e.g., Bryan et al., 2010; Mandracchia & Smith, 2015; Holm-Denoma et al., 2008; Van Orden et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2013). Studies that specifically apply and examine the constructs posed by Joiner (2005) to SMIs, however, are few (Hill & Pettit, 2012; Silva et al., 2015; Woodward et al., 2014). What has been examined, however, appears to provide support for the use of the ITS among SMIs. Empirical support for PB among SMIs is demonstrated by Silva et al. (2015), who found that when compared with heterosexual peers, sexual minority undergraduates had higher degrees of PB and suicidal ideation, along with anxiety, suicide attempts, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and poor positive affect. Experiences of discrimination at personal and institutional levels (Haas et al., 2011; McDermott, Roen, & Scourfield, 2008), paired with lower status (Halpert, 2002) has been suggested to aid in SMIs self-perception of being a burden onto loved ones due to failing to meet societal expectations. For those who do view themselves as failing to reach societal standards, shame is posited to result (Lewis, 2004), which is a suicidal risk factors found to associate with PB (Van Orden et al., 2010).  Some SMIs may also see themselves as a burden to family and friends if they hold the belief that their identity is a stressor onto their loved ones, including if the loved one feels obligated to advocate for sexual minorities (Hilton & Szymanski, 2011). PB, anxiety, negative affect, and suicidal ideation were found to occur at greater rates in \t\t58 sexual minority undergraduate students than their heterosexual peers (Silva et al., 2015). After controlling for anxiety, symptom severity, and positive and negative affect, PB has been found to fully mediate the relationship between sexual identity and suicidal ideation (Hill & Pettit, 2012; Silva et al., 2015). Silva et al. (2015) posed that LGB individuals likely experience PB and TB because of discrimination, bullying, and possible peer rejections. In addition, they state that TB may be due to a result of feeling rejected and socially alienated based on their sexual orientation. LGB adolescents and emerging adults are found to report low social support, self-esteem, and feelings of connection (Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Lamis, & Malone, 2010; Rosario, Schrimshaw, & Hunter, 2005; Safren & Heimberg, 1999). This pairs with the TB dimension of lack of reciprocally caring relationships. Also, the second TB dimension of loneliness is illustrated in findings of sexual minority college students who reported high levels of loneliness (Westefeld, Maples, Buford, & Taylor, 2001). Exploratory analyses, though, have not found TB to mediate the relationship between sexual orientation and suicide risk (Hill & Pettit, 2012; Silva et al., 2015). Despite these findings, TB has been found to be significantly higher among a sample of sexual minority undergraduates who were compared to heterosexual peers (Hill & Pettit, 2012; Silva et al., 2015).  When considering possible PB and TB among SMIs, research has illustrated consistent findings in that PB was positively associated with TB (r = .69, p < .001) and suicidal ideation (r = .73, p < .001) (Silva et al., 2015). Though PB and TB have been found to be strongly related (Baams et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2015), they are still considered separate constructs, staying consistent with the ITS. Also consistent were \t\t59 findings of PB and TB having a higher correlation with suicidal ideation (r = .55, .73) than suicidal attempts (r = .36).  Hill and Pettit (2012) investigated possible indirect impacts of sexual orientation on suicidal ideation using the ITS constructs of PB and TB among Hispanic college undergraduates. While controlling for depressive symptoms, race, and gender, they found that the relationship between sexual orientation and suicidal ideation was partially mediated by PB, but not TB. In addition, higher degrees of anticipated or perceived rejection based on one’s sexual orientation was found to have stronger effect on this mediating relationship. The lack of TB effect on the relationship was suggested to be due to a limitation of using undergraduate students, who have been theorized to have sufficient chances to meet belongingness needs via the college campus.   Lastly, studies have found that SMIs may gain greater degrees of AC than their heterosexual counterparts due to exposure to prejudice and discrimination (e.g., physical hate crimes, violence against them due to their sexual orientation) (Herek, 2009; Silva et al., 2015). SMIs who had a history of suicide attempts had higher degrees of AC than those who did not have a history of attempts (Plöderl et al., 2014), which is consistent with the ITS. To reiterate, however, suicidal ideation is found to be separate and distinct from suicide attempts (Van Orden et al., 2010). Due to the current study’s focus on suicidal ideation, AC was not assessed in this study.  Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and  Sexual Minority Stress  Few studies have examined the relationship between the ITS (Joiner, 2005) and SMS model (Meyer, 2003) (e.g., Baams et al., 2015; Plöderl et al., 2014). To date, this author has found no studies that have utilized all of the sources of stress constructs \t\t60 (experience of prejudice, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and internalized homophobia) posed by the SMS model (Meyer, 2003) in relation to the ITS. Rather, the studies discussed have only examined one or two of these constructs.   Plöderl et al. (2014) found in their study that the ITS (Joiner, 2005) is able to explain suicidal ideation among some SMIs. For LGBs, suicidal ideation was correlated with PB and TB, with large effect sizes (Plöderl et al., 2014). Through the variables of internalized homophobia, social support, and early coming out, the ITS was found to intertwine with the SMS model (Meyer, 2003; Plöderl et al., 2014). Internalized homophobia may increase one’s risk for depression, but it is theorized that without the addition of PB or hopelessness, an individual will likely not develop suicidal ideation (Plöderl et al., 2014), as those are two factors assumed to predict the development of suicidal ideation (Joiner, 2005; Mann, Waternaux, Haas, & Malone, 1999). Due to this, the SMS model was hypothesized to be necessary in explaining the risk of suicide in SMIs, but not sufficient (Plöderl et al., 2014). The ITS and SMS model were found to highly interrelate with the factors, including, perceived burdensomeness, failed belongingness, and social support. The correlation matrix of this study illustrated that the SMS model and the ITS were linked with social support, internalized homophobia, and degree of being visible.  Baams et al. (2015) conducted a study among sexual minority youth. Results indicated that sexual orientation victimization negatively impacted the degree of suicidal ideation and depression, which was theorized to be due to feeling like a burden onto others. Participants with higher degrees of coming-out stress and victimization also reported higher degrees of PB, depression, and suicidal ideation. Overall, PB was found \t\t61 to mediate sexual orientation victimization and depression’s relationship with suicidal ideation, regardless of gender or sexual identity. TB was also found to have a significant relationship with higher degrees of depression and suicidal ideation. Baams et al.’s (2015) findings illustrate consistency with the literature on suicidal ideation and behavior (Hill & Pettit, 2012; Joiner et al., 2009; Van Orden et al., 2008; Woodward et al., 2014), and with the literature of the impact of SMS (Meyer, 2003).  Measuring Constructs Sexual Orientation Victimization  Scale   The experience of prejudice is one of the constructs of Meyer’s SMS model (2003), and refers to the violent and discriminating events that SMIs have historically faced. Studies that have attempted to assess this construct have utilized different measures, including: Distal Minority Stress (Plöderl et al., 2014), Schedule for Heterosexual Events scale and Victimization scale (Livingston et al., 2015), the Heterosexual Harassment, Rejection, & Discrimination scale (Szymanski et al., 2014), and the Sexual Orientation Victimization scale (D’Augelli, Grossman, & Starks, 2008).  Plöderl et al. (2014) examined the suicide risk of LGBs by contrasting the SMS model with ITS and the clinical model. In this study, they measure distal minority stress all together in 12 yes/no response items about experiences of violence and discrimination, which were informed by suggestions from Herek (1990) and Plöderl and Fartacek (2009). This measure assessed if violence (e.g., been spat on) had occurred, and if it was due to one’s sexual orientation. Internal consistency for this measure was Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .84 for general violence, and Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .98 for the violence to be based on sexual orientation. Though this measure has high internal consistency reliability in this study, \t\t62 there does not appear to be other studies that have utilized this measure. Given that there is only one study to provide support for the psychometric properties, and that the scale does not explicitly assess frequency of victimization, only if it occurred, this scale was not used in the current study.  Livingston et al. (2015) examined SMS and suicide risk through analyzing personality profiles of SMIs. In this study, the Schedule for Heterosexual Events scale (Selvidge, 2000) and Victimization scale (adapted from Herek & Berrill, 1992a) were used to assess discrimination and victimization, respectively. The Schedule for Heterosexist Events item responses range from 1 “never” to 5 “very often,” with higher scores indicating higher degree of lifetime discrimination (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .93). The Victimization scale is a 10-item measure that assesses the number of times respondents experienced the forms of victimization presented, which was indicated by 0 “not applicable/never” to 5 “more than 20 times” (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .85). Though this measure does have high internal consistency reliability and measures both discrimination and victimization, the measure was not available for this researcher’s use.   Szymanski et al. (2014) examined how multiple minority stressors impact psychological distress among sexual minority women. The researchers utilized the Heterosexual Harassment, Rejection, & Discrimination scale (Szymanski, 2006), which is a scale consisting of 14-items that assess the frequency of harassment, rejection, and discrimination sexual minority females experience due to their sexual orientation (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .90). Though this measure found high internal consistency reliability, it was specifically normed on, and made to use with, sexual minority women. Therefore, \t\t63 the Heterosexual Harassment, Rejection, & Discrimination scale was not used in the current study.  The SOV scale (D’Augelli et al., 2008) was made to assess the frequency of lifetime victimization due to one’s sexual orientation through six-items. Responses for questions about experiences of victimization are coded on a 4-point Lickert scale, ranging from 0 “never” to 3 “three or more times.” Baams et al. (2015) utilized a version of this measure in their in-depth investigation into the SMS model’s relationship with suicidal ideation, where they found a Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .84. Given that the SOV has been found to have high internal consistency reliability, is short in length, assesses for lifetime frequency of victimization, and is available for use, it was used for the current study to assess for experiences of prejudice. The psychometric properties, and an in-depth discussion on the measure will occur is found in Chapter III.  Gay-Related Rejection  Sensitivity Scale  The expectations of rejection is another construct of Meyer’s SMS model (2003), and refers to the degree to which one is expecting to be rejected by others due to their sexual orientation. It appears that studies that examined the relationship between the SMS model and suicidal ideation have not all utilized the construct of expectations of rejections (e.g., Livingston et al., 2015; Plöderl et al., 2014; Szymanski et al., 2014). The specificity of expectations of rejections for SMIs appears to have made it difficult to find scales that are appropriate to the construct and the population. Baams et al. (2015) assessed stress associated with LGB individuals’ coming out through an expanded version of a gay-related stress scale (Rosario, Rotheram-Borus, & Reid 1996). This scale was comprised of 10-items that participants responded to with a 5-point Likert scale, \t\t64 ranging from 0 “no stress” to 4 “extremely stressful” (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .90). Even though this scale was found to have high internal consistency reliability, it asked for a retroactive rating of stress (e.g., rate how stressful the situation was for you: when you came out to your parents as a sexual minority). This not only assumes an accurate rating of past feelings, but it also places assumptions on participants (e.g., that they are “out”). Another scale was found to measure expectations of rejection among SMIs. Specifically, Pachankis et al. (2008) expanded a rejection sensitivity construct to apply to the interpersonal functioning of gay men. This resulted in a 14-item Gay-Related Rejection Sensitivity scale (GRRS), and has found high internal consistency reliability in a another study, with Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .86 (Pachankis, Hatzenbuehler, & Starks, 2014). Feinstein et al. (2012) modified the GRRS down to 12-items that allowed for scenarios to apply to all sexual minorities, not just gay-males. The scale presents respondents with 12 different scenarios that could be considered a rejecting experience based on sexual orientation. For each scenario, the participants are asked to rate how concerned or anxious they are that the scenario occurred due to their sexual orientation, and how likely they believe it was due to their sexual orientation (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .92). The modified GRRS not only measures expectations of rejection, but also does not ask for a retroactive rating of an experience. Due to these factors, the GRRS-modified was used in the current study to assess expectations of rejection. The psychometric properties, and in-depth discussion on the measure is found in Chapter III. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Visibility  Management Scale   Hiding and concealing, another SMS model construct (Meyer, 2003), refers to the degree a sexual minority conceals or reveals their sexual orientation. In Livingston et \t\t65 al.’s (2015) study that examined SMS, the Outness Inventory (Mohr & Fassinger, 2000) was utilized to assess the construct of hiding and concealing (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .86). In a similar study, Baams et al. (2015) investigated SMS utilizing a set of questions informed by D’Augelli et al. (2008) to assess the degree of outness of their participants (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .88). Though these efforts were found good internal consistency reliability, the measures were assessing how out and open SMIs were. This does not fully capture the construct of hiding and concealing, as this concept refers to time and energy put forth to manage one’s identity, which is the vigilance aspect. A scale that takes more than outness into consideration is the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Visibility Management Scale (LGB-VMS; Lasser et al., 2010a). The LGB-VMS utilizes three subscales: Active Behavioral (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .88), Inhibitive Behavioral (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .92), and Setting (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .75). These subscales assess the behaviors used to make one’s sexual identity visible, the feelings associated with disclosing one’s sexual orientation, and the role that social settings play in decision making about being visible, respectively. Each item of the LGB-VMS is assessed using a six-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 “strongly disagree” to 5 “strongly agree,” with higher scores indicating a higher degree of openness about sexual orientation. Due to the LGB-VMS having a more holistic assessment of the degree to which a SMI manages the visibility of their sexual orientation, it was used in the current study to assess hiding and concealing. The psychometric properties and in-depth discussion on the measure is found in Chapter III.    \t\t66 Revised Internalized  Homophobia Scale   Internalized homophobia, the last sources of stress construct of the SMS Model (Meyer, 2003), refers to the process of internally directing ant-gay attitudes towards oneself. Internalized homophobia is a concept that has been measured using many different instruments. Shidlo (1994) developed the Revised Homosexuality Attitude Inventory (RHAI), which consists of 20 items that are assessed using a four-point Likert scale that ranges from 1 “strongly disagree” to 4 “strongly agree.” The Personal Homonegativity subscale, though, specifically assesses personal discomfort with being a sexual minority (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .81; D’Augelli et al., 2002 ). D’Augelli et al. (2008) also used this scale, finding a Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .76.  Livingston et al. (2015) assessed internalized homophobia with an Internalized Heterosexism measure, which was structured based off of the ego-dystonic homosexuality criteria put forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-III-R (Herek et al., 2009a). This assessed the degree of negative self-perception based on sexual orientation, and items were assessed using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 “strongly disagree to 5 “strongly agree” (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .77). Another scale utilized, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Identity Scale (LGBIS), which was developed by Mohr and Fassinger (2003) and contains a Homonegativity Subscale that has been found to have a Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .78 to .88 (Kaysen, Kulesza, Balsam, Rhew, & Blayney, 2014; Mohr & Daly, 2008). The Homonegativity Subscale is assessed through a six-point Likert scale that ranges from 1 “disagree strongly” to 6 “strongly agree.”  Another measure, the Internalized Homophobia Scale (IHP; Meyer, 1995), has been used in various studies to assess this concept. The IHP consists of nine-items that \t\t67 are assessed with a four-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 “never” to 4 “often” (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .82). Other studies that have utilized the IHP have found Cronbach 𝛼’s ranging from .80 to .89 (Meidlinger & Hope, 2014; Mereish & Poteat, 2015).  Since the IHP’s development, however, Herek, Gillis, and Cogan (2009b) have created the Internalized Homophobia Scale-Revised (IHP-R). The IHP-R has been developed to have more inclusive language and uses fewer items while still maintaining a good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .82). Validity has also been established through finding a positive correlation with expectations of rejection due to sexual orientation, and by the degree of concealing one’s sexual minority status (Mason, Lewis, Winstead, & Derlega, 2015). Multiple other studies have used the IHP-R, providing a wealth of support of its use (Kelley et al., 2014; Lassiter, 2013; Lea, de Wit, & Reynolds, 2014; Lewis, Milletich, Mason, & Derlega, 2014; Mason et al., 2015; Szymanski et al., 2014), and continuously demonstrating good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .78 to .84). There are multiple measures and scales that have been historically utilized to assess the degree of internalized homophobia among SMIs. Though several of these are appropriate to use, the IHP-R (Herek et al., 2009b) was utilized in the current study due to its stable internal consistency reliability, validity based on SMS concepts, and efficient length. Further psychometric properties and an in-depth discussion on the measure is found in Chapter III.  It should also be noted that in a study conducted by Kuyper and Fokkema (2010), they structured a Minority Stress Measure, which specifically assesses the constructs of SMS. There are a few reasons why this measure was not utilized in this study. First, the \t\t68 measure was retroactively structured around data that was previously obtained, and therefore the items were based on the prior results of the 2002 Gay Autumn survey.  Second, the study was conducted in the Netherlands and therefore the measure appears to be in Dutch. Third, the study investigated loneliness among sexual minority elderly, therefore items were specific to this population (e.g., negative interactions with elderly housing and caregivers). Though the Minority Stress Measure assesses all of the constructs of the SMS model (Meyer, 2003), it did not align with the population the current study is sampling from, who are adult sexual minority individuals who live in the U.S. Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire The Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ; Van Orden et al., 2012) was utilized to operationalize the ITS constructs of perceived burdensomeness (PB) and thwarted belongingness (TB), along with suicidal ideation. The INQ was specially developed for the purpose of assessing PB and TB. Therefore, the items on this measure were developed around the theoretical underpinnings of the ITS. The INQ is consistently utilized in the research to assess PB, TB, and suicidal ideation (e.g., Bryan et al., 2010; Hill & Pettit, 2012; Silva et al., 2015; Van Orden et al., 2010; Woodward et al., 2014). Due to the INQ being a measure that specializes in assessing the ITS, it was used for the current study.  Since the INQ’s creation, it has gone through five different versions, including a 10-, 12-, 15-, 18-, and 25-item version (Hill et al., 2015). After running a confirmatory factor analysis on the differing versions, Hill et al. (2015) found that the 10- and 15-item versions were the most consistent and had the best fitting model. Though the 10-item \t\t69 version of the INQ was the only one to consistently predict suicidal ideation, the 15-item version has been used among LGB individuals (Silva et al., 2015). Due to the 15-item version of the INQ being an expansion on the same questions used in the 10-item version, as well as the 15-item version having had psychometric properties published for a sexual minority sample, the 15-item version of the INQ was utilized in the current study. The psychometric properties, and in-depth discussion on norming samples is found in Chapter III.  Summary  This chapter has provided an extensive literature review on the Sexual Minority Stress model (SMS; Meyer, 2003) and how it relates to the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS; Joiner, 2005).  What is currently known is that there are high rates of suicide among sexual minorities (Mathy, 2002b; Silva et al., 2015). Suicidal ideation has been illustrated to precede suicide attempts and therefore is important to investigate (Beck et al., 1997). The SMS model is found to help understand the relationship with unique stressors that SMIs experience and the deleterious impacts on their physical and mental health (Meyer & Frost, 2013). Specifically, the SMS model has been hypothesized to be necessary in explaining the risk of suicide among SMIs, but it is not sufficient (Plöderl et al., 2014). The major constructs of the ITS (PB and TB) have been found to predict suicidal ideation (Van Orden et al., 2008). In addition, there is a highly intertwined relationship found between the ITS and the SMS model (Plöderl et al., 2014), which supports the idea that PB and TB could be the necessary addition to the SMS model that will explain the risk of suicide among SMIs.  \t\t70 A few studies have investigated the relationship between the SMS model and the ITS constructs of PB and TB (Baams et al., 2015; Plöderl et al., 2014). To date, this author has found no studies that utilize all of the sources of stress constructs (experience of prejudice, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and internalized homophobia) posed by the SMS model (Meyer, 2003) when exploring this relationship with ITS. Rather, the studies discussed have only examined one or two of these constructs. This is an identified gap in the literature. The current study aimed to find the best predictive model using all of the sources of stress constructs (experience of prejudice, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and internalized homophobia) and the ITS constructs of PB and TB. Overall, it is hoped that this predictive model will aid in identifying the prevention and intervention techniques that could be specific to the sexual minority population.      \t\t71    CHAPTER III METHODOLOGY The purpose of this study was to better understand the impacts of the Sexual Minority Stress model (SMS; Meyer, 2003) on the degree of suicidal ideation through the lens of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS; Joiner, 2005). The investigator recruited adult sexual minority individuals (SMIs) from sexual minority organizations from across the country. Eligible and consenting participants completed a series of online questionnaires administered through Qualtrics (2015), a secure online survey distribution and collection software program.  Once data were collected, various statistical analyses were utilized in an attempt to answer the research questions and hypotheses put forth. The independent variables allowed for the constructs of the SMS model to be operationalized, respectively. This chapter is comprised of this study’s methodology, which is represented in the following sections. First presented is the description of the study design. Next, participants and the a-priori findings for recommended sample size is discussed. Procedures then follow this section, which outlines: the participant recruitment strategy, informed consent, survey distribution, instrumentation, and data handling and analysis procedures used.   Study Design  The current study did not manipulate the independent variables and did not randomly assign subjects. Therefore, it was non-experimental in nature with a \t\t72 quantitative methodology. Even though using both quantitative and qualitative methods are more likely to yield a more holistic answer (Remler, & Van Ryzin, 2011), doing so is not always feasible for the problem put forth. Remler and Van Ryzin (2011) proposed that matching the method to the question at hand is what is the most important to consider. They continued on to state that sampling and measurements are required when considering the extent of the problem at hand. Due to there being scales with established psychometric properties that match the constructs being utilized, along with the research questions that are attempting to look at amount of variance explained, quantitative analysis was deemed appropriate for use. For this study, a quantitative approach was used to assess the amount of variance in perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and suicidal ideation, each uniquely versus jointly explained by the independent variables of degree of sexual orientation victimization, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for sexual minority adults.  This study used a quantitative, cross-sectional, non-experimental design. This design allowed for the use of surveys, which comes with several advantages. One of the original reasons that surveys were used was to gain an understanding of a social problem (Groves et al., 2009). Survey methodology comes from a field that has a main goal of improving quality of research in a cost-effective manner, all while maintaining the quality of the research (2009). Web-based surveys offer the additional advantage of reaching a broader sample, as well as instant data entry and ease of data collection (Granello & Wheaton, 2004). Web-based surveying also has been found to increase the privacy of responses (2009), while additionally providing a sense of social distance that may allow for more honesty (Daley, McDermott, Brown, & Kittleson, 2003). This sense \t\t73 of privacy and distance aided the current study, as the scales contain items addressing potentially sensitive issues such as sexual orientation, suicidal ideation, and victimization experiences.  Participants The target sample for the current study consisted of adults who identify as SMIs. Inclusion criteria for this study included those who (a) were 18 years or older, and (b) identified as non-heterosexual. The inclusion criteria were mentioned in the informed consent, and confirmed on the demographic questionnaire. The accessible population included those who were adult non-heterosexual identified individuals who were connected with a sexual minority organization (e.g., The GLBT Community Center of Colorado). An a priori computation of a necessary sample size for multiple linear regression in order to find significance was conducted using G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, & Lang, 2009). With the input parameters set at 𝛼 = 0.05, f2 = 0.15, 1 − 𝛽\t= 0.80 and with four predictor variables, a total minimum sample size of 129 was deemed necessary for this multiple linear regression analysis. Another a priori computation was conducted in order to find a necessary sample size for the independent samples t-tests, with the input parameters set at Tail = 2, 𝛼 = 0.05, and 1 − 𝛽\t= 0.80. A total sample size of 64 for each group was deemed necessary for independent samples t-tests. Though 129 was the minimum necessary, the principal investigator recruited 265 participants to account for incomplete surveys, attrition, outliers, and other various factors.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t74 Procedures Participant Recruitment After receiving approval from the University of Northern Colorado Institutional Review Board (UNC IRB) (see Appendix A), participants were recruited through sexual minority organizations across the United States (U.S.). The investigator first identified the organizations and groups from which to recruit participants. In order to identify sites to contact, the researcher conducted an online search including two terms; the first was based on a sexual orientation identity, such as “bisexual.” The second term was each geographic state (e.g., Colorado). A sexual orientation identity was entered with each state and Washington, D.C., resulting in a total of 51 searches. Recruitment occurred across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. as an attempt to find a representative sample of U.S. sexual minority adults. Organizations were chosen based on a few factors, including: e-mail or social media contact information listed for the site’s director/lead organizer, the organization offered services to multiple sexual minority identities, and the organization provided a sense of community through organized gatherings. After meeting these criteria, the sites were chosen based on their order of appearance in the generated search results. \tAfter the organizations were chosen, the researcher made contact with each organization via e-mail or private message. The message (see Appendix B) included the principal investigator’s title and contact information, the title of the dissertation, that the study was approved by the UNC IRB, the rationale for the importance of the research, the study inclusion criteria, the option for individual participants to join a raffle upon completion of the study as gratitude for their participation, possible options for \t\t75 distributing the research link, and the Qualtrics survey link to begin participation. Organizations that agreed to distribute the recruitment request then had the freedom to share the survey link in any format they chose, including via e-mail, posting it on websites, posting flyers, etc.  Due to this being a similar recruitment strategy as Woodward et al. (2014), a similar response rate was expected. Of the 250 recruitment e-mails they sent out, 60 sites agreed to distribute the survey, which was a 24% response rate and resulted in 251 responses from participants. The current study includes contacted than approximately 313 sites, which returned 265 responses. The current recruitment method proved to be more than sufficient in reaching the minimal sample size of 129 that was computed in the a-priori analysis by G*Power (Faul et al., 2009).  The initial recruitment procedure of contacting two sites per state did not result in a large enough sample size, therefore, more rounds of organizational searches were conducted. Specifically, the principal investigator continued to search for running organizations for each state until there were no more organizations to be found via an online search. While it was originally proposed to assess the ranking of states from well-represented to least-represented based on the number of organizations that indicated that they agreed to participate in the recruitment process in the first round, this was not feasible. The lack of feasibility was due to the fact that states with the least-represented number of organizations did not having more organizations to recruit from.  Informed Consent After the sites received the recruitment e-mail, had chosen to participate, and had distributed the survey link in the form of their choosing (e.g., website posting, listserv \t\t76 e-mail, or flyers), those who were interested in participating had access to the study. By clicking on the survey link or by entering the URL in a web browser, the participants were directed to the study’s informed consent page on the Qualtrics website. The informed consent webpage (see Appendix C) included the following information: the project title, the principal investigator’s name and information, the research advisor’s name and information, an overview of the topic of the study, a statement informing them they may choose to enter an optional raffle where they could win one of three $25 Amazon gift cards as a sign of appreciation for their participation, that 20 to 30 minutes is the approximate total time to complete the study, possible risks and benefits of participation, that their responses will be kept anonymous, that the study is UNC-IRB approved, and that participation is voluntary. Finally, potential participants were informed that by clicking the “Next” button, they were indicating that they both understood the information above and agreed to participate in the study. If the participants clicked “Next,” they continued onto the first survey. As a means to ensure anonymity of their responses, no directly identifiable information was collected (e.g., name, social security number, or IP address).   Survey Distribution After participants gave consent to participate in the study, they were directed to a list of national mental health agencies and organizations as a means of support (see Appendix D). This resources webpage had a foreword written to indicate that the list was also available upon completion of the study. Providing the list of resources prior to starting the study ensured that even those who decided to drop out would still have access to the resources. The study then began with the Demographic Questionnaire A (see \t\t77 Appendix E). Next, the following instruments were presented in a randomized order: The Sexual Orientation Victimization Scale (SOV; D’Augelli et al.,  2008) (see Appendix G), the Gay-Related Rejection Sensitivity Scale – Modified (GRRS-Modified; Feinstein et al., 2012) (see Appendix H), the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Visibility Management Scale (LGB-VMS; Lasser, Ryser, & Price, 2010b) (see Appendix I), the Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale (IHP-R; Herek et al., 2009b) (see Appendix J) and the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ; Van Orden et al., 2012) (see Appendix K). Then the study presented the Demographic Questionnaire B (see Appendix F).  Upon the completion of all surveys, the next webpage presented the same list of national mental health resources (see Appendix D). Next, the last page of the study included a formal statement thanking them for their participation as well as an option to enter the raffle to win one of three $25 Amazon gift cards. Participants were informed that entering the raffle was voluntary, and that they were able to enter by clicking a link provided on that webpage, where they then were asked in a separate survey to provide their e-mail address. This process ensured that anonymity would be maintained, as no identifying information was attached to the data. Once recruitment was finished, the Qualtrics survey link had the survey replaced with a statement indicating to the individual that the survey has been completed (e.g., “Thank you for your interest in participating in this study, but recruitment has been completed. If you have any questions, please contact the principal investigator: Caroline Hicks at Caroline.Hicks@unco.edu.”).    \t\t78 Instrumentation Demographic Questionnaire  A and B    As a means to collect demographic characteristics of the participants, the current study used a two-part demographic questionnaire developed by the principal investigator (see Appendices E and F). Demographic Questionnaire-A assessed the inclusion criterion of age, where the participant filled in their age in a free text response option. If they indicated that they are under the age of 18, they were automatically removed from the study. Sexual orientation was another inclusion criterion assessed by the Demographic Questionnaire A, where if participants selected the option of “heterosexual” from a provided drop-down menu, they were automatically removed from the study. At the end of the Demographic Questionnaire A, the following inclusivity statement and definition of sexual orientation was also provided as an instructional transition into the survey: “Important Note: Before beginning this study, please understand that standardized scales to-date often are not written as inclusively as they perhaps should be. The principal investigator made every attempt to make thoughtful selections and edits to the selected scales in order to ensure that they are as inclusive as possible without compromising their integrity. In addition, there will be a comment box at the end of this study for any and all thoughts or reactions to the current study. Finally, please know that any time the term “sexual orientation” is used, it is referring to one’s sexual identity (e.g., bisexual, asexual, gay, lesbian, pansexual, etc.”\tThe investigator collected the remaining demographic characteristics at the end of the survey with the Demographic Questionnaire B (see Appendix F). Gender and race/ethnicity were collected by having the participant select the category that they \t\t79 identified via response options provided through a drop-down menu, or by filling in the blank under an “other” option. Coming out status was obtained through a forced response option of yes or no. For those who selected “yes,” they were then asked to provide the age in which they first came out to someone close, and also asked who they came out to by selecting persons (e.g., parent) from a provided list. Next, response options provided through a drop-down menu allowed for a collection of the state of residence. Information on a history of suicide attempts was collected via a yes or no option. If the participant selected “yes” for a history of suicide attempts, they were then asked to provide the number of past attempts via a drop-down menu. Lastly, an open comment box was made available for any feedback that the participants had in regards to the study or for the investigator.  Sexual Orientation Victimization  Scale  For the purposes of the study, the Sexual Orientation Victimization Scale (SOV; D'Augelli et al., 2008; see Appendix G) was used to operationalize and measure the degree to which one has experienced prejudice or discrimination due to their sexual orientation. This researcher was given written permission to use the SOV by the creator, Anthony R. D’Augelli (see Appendix L). The SOV scale takes approximately three minutes to complete and consists of six items that describe specific forms of victimization experienced potentially due to one’s sexual orientation including: hearing verbal insults, being threatened with physical violence, having objects thrown at them, being punched/kicked/beaten, being threatened with a knife/gun/other weapon, and being sexually attacked or raped. Participants were asked to describe how often each type of victimization has occurred in their lifetimes according to a 4-point Likert-type scale with \t\t80 anchors that ranged from 0 “never” to 3 “three or more times.” The degree of lifetime victimization was calculated by summing the score of the six items. Total scores could possibly range from 0 to 18, with higher scores equating a higher perceived frequency of prejudicial victimization experiences.  Due to the SOV being so specific to the victimization of SMIs, there are few studies that have utilized and reported on its psychometric properties. D’Augelli et al. (2002), however, were able to utilize the SOV and reported findings relevant for the use of this scale. For example, total victimization was found to positively relate to mental health and trauma symptoms that were measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis, 1993) and the Trauma Symptom Checklist (TSC; Briere & Runtz, 1989) respectively (D’Augelli et al., 2002). Verbal sexual orientation victimization was found in a model that accounted for 18% of the variance in traumatic stress scores (R2 = .20, F[5, 273] = 12.48, p < .001), along with the other variables of gender, years “out,” openness in high school, gender atypicality, and personal homo-negativity. Though the D’Augelli et al. (2002) study did not report the psychometric properties outright for the SOV, they discussed that the items of the SOV have been found to have important relationships with PB and suicidal ideation. Baams et al. (2015) reported the SOV to have an internal consistency reliability of 𝛼 = .84 for their sample of LGB youth. Their study revealed that the SOV was found to have a positive association with coming out stress (r = .22, p < .001), PB (r = .10, p < .001), and suicidal ideation (r = .16, p < .001).  Due to the SOV (a) being used in multiple studies to assess sexual orientation victimization, (b) having an internal consistency reliability that was above Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .70, and (c) having been found to work in models that account for variance of traumatic \t\t81 stress, the SOV was deemed appropriate for the purposes of assessing the independent variable of experience of prejudice and discrimination due to one’s sexual orientation.  Gay-Related Rejection Sensitivity  Scale – Modified  For the purposes of this study, the Gay-Related Rejection Sensitivity Scale-Modified (GRRS-M) (Feinstein et al., 2012; see Appendix H) was used to operationalize and measure the degree to which one expects to be rejected by others due to their sexual orientation. The modified version of the GRRS takes approximately six minutes to complete. The Gay-Related Rejection Sensitivity Scale is listed on the PsycTEST database with its permission for use clause (Pachankis, 2008).  The GRRS is listed as allowed for use in regards to “non-commercial research and educational purposes without seeking written permission” (2008, p. 1).  The GRRS-M (Feinstein et al., 2012) consists of 12 scenarios that are one to three sentences long each. Participants were asked to read each scenario and vividly imagine as if they were in that situation (e.g., You bring a partner you are dating to a fancy restaurant of straight patrons, and you are seated away from everyone else in a back corner of the restaurant) (Feinstein et al, 2012). For each of the 12 scenarios, participants reported ratings for two different items, resulting in 24 items that were rated. The participants used a 6-point Likert-type scale with anchors consisting of 1 “Very unconcerned” to 6 “Very concerned”. The first item that they rated was based on how concerned or anxious they were that the scenario happened due to their sexual orientation. The second question that they rated was based on how likely the scenario happened due to the participant’s sexual orientation.  \t\t82 The modifications made from the original GRRS (Pachankis et al., 2008) included the removal of two items that were more focused on gay-male situations (e.g., “Only you and a group of macho men are on a subway train late at night. They look in your direction and laugh.”; 2008, p. 309), as well as rewording all items to be more gender-neutral (e.g., “You’ve been dating someone for a few years now, and you receive a wedding invitation to a straight friend’s wedding. The invite was addressed only to you, not you and a guest”; 2008, p. 309). These modifications allowed for what was a gay male-specified scale to become applicable for a wider range of sexual minority identities. Scores for the GRRS-M were derived in a three-step process. First, the two item scores for each scenario were multiplied together (Likelihood x Anxiety).  Second, the multiplied scores for each scenario were summed together. Third, the summed scores were then divided by the total number of scenarios (12). Total scores had the possibility of ranging from 1 to 36, with higher scores equating to a higher degree of rejection sensitivity experienced by the participant.   Feinstein et al. (2012) found an excellent internal consistency of Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .92 for the modified version of the GRRS among a sample of lesbian and gay adults. When looking at the concurrent validity by comparing the original and modified versions, internal consistency scores for the two were nearly identical (12-item: 𝛼 = .89; 14-item: 𝛼 =.90) and the correlation between them was .99 (p < .001; Feinstein et al., 2012). The original 14-item GRRS had demonstrated good to excellent internal consistency, Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .86 to .91, with a mean inter-item correlation of r = .42 (p < .05 to p < .01) that placed it in the category of a narrow-band construct (Pachankis et al., 2008; Pachankis et al., 2014). Pachankis et al. (2008) also demonstrated construct validity for \t\t83 the GRRS through their finding that parental rejection and rejection sensitivity were not only significantly related (β = .24, t(110) = 2.53, p < .05), but that parental rejection also was found to predict degree of rejection sensitivity.  Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Visibility  Management Scale   The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Visibility Management Scale (LGB-VMS; Lasser et al., 2010b) was utilized for the purpose of operationalizing and measuring the degree to which one conceals or reveals their sexual identity (see Appendix I). Visibility refers to the degree that a SMI has made their sexual orientation known to others. The LGB-VMS takes approximately seven minutes to complete.  The LGB-VMS is listed on the PsycTEST database with its permission for use clause (Lasser et al., 2010b).  The LGB-VMS is listed as allowed for use in regards to “non-commercial research and educational purposes without seeking written permission” (2010b, p. 1).  The LGB-VMS consists of 28 items that participants rated based on a 6-point Likert-type scale, with the anchor points of 1 “strongly disagree” to 6 “strongly agree” (Lasser et al., 2010b). It also includes one item that asked the participants to rate their level of visibility, which was based upon a 10-point Likert-type scale that ranged from 1 “Totally in the closet” to 10 “Totally out of the closet.” The LGB-VMS consists of three subscales, including the 13-item Inhibitive Behavioral subscale (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .92), the 11-item Active Behavioral subscale (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .88), and the four-item Setting subscale (Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .75) (Lasser et al., 2010a). Fifteen items of the LGB-VMS required reverse-coding.  The LGB-VMS total score was calculated by first summing the scores for each separate subscale. After the subscales were totaled, then the total score for overall visibility was calculated by adding together the subscale scores. Total scores on \t\t84 the LGB-VMS could possibly range from 28 to 168, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of openness about one’s sexual minority identity (Dewaele et al., 2014).  Due to its strong psychometric properties, the LGB-VMS was used for the current study for the purposes of assessing the independent variable of hiding and concealing. Item analysis during the LGB-VMS’s scale development revealed that the item discrimination coefficients were moderate to high-ranging (.30 to .79), indicating that the items are reasonably good to very good to use (Lasser et al., 2010a). Convergent validity was found by correlating the total of the scale with the Ability to Modify Self-Presentation (AMSP: Lennox & Wolfe, 1984) and a researcher-devised visibility ruler (Lasser et al.,2010a). Statistically significant correlations were found between the total of LGB-VMS and the AMSP (R2 = .20, p < .05), as well as between the LGB-VMS and the visibility ruler (R2 = .59, p < .05). Here, convergent validity refers to the degree to which the LGB-VMS is measuring constructs that are theoretically-related. Daewale et al. (2014) found the internal consistency reliability for an abbreviated version of the LGB-VMS to be Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .89.  Revised Internalized  Homophobia Scale  The last construct of Meyer’s (2003) SMS model utilized within the current study was internalized homophobia. For the purposes of operationalizing and measuring the process of internally directing antigay attitudes towards oneself, the Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale (IHP-R; Herek et al., 2009b) was used (see Appendix J). The IHP-R is five items long and takes approximately two to three minutes to complete. The Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale is listed on the PsycTEST database with its permission for use clause (Herek et al., 2009b).  The IHP-R is listed as allowed for use in regards to \t\t85 “non-commercial research and educational purposes without seeking written permission” (2009b, p. 1).  The IHP-R (Herek et al., 2009b) is a five-item measure where participants rate their level of agreement with each statement on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from the anchors of 1 “disagree strongly” to 5 “agree strongly.” Total scores were calculated by adding together all item scores and dividing by five to get the average. Therefore, total scores ranged from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of internalized homophobia. An additional sentence (“If you feel the item does not apply to you, you may skip the item”) was added to the instructions for this scale to allow for inclusivity to specific sexual identities (e.g., asexual individuals). As a means to ensure that the measure was more inclusive, the language was altered from “lesbian/bisexual” and “gay/bisexual” to “sexual minority.” For those who opted to skip an item, the calculation was adjusted to reflect their average score based on the number of items they rated.  With the exception of one low variability item on the IHP-R (“I would like to get professional help in order to change my sexual orientation from [sexual minority] to straight”) that had a loading of .44, a confirmatory factor analysis of its items proved to be a good fit (five items:  χ2 (5, N = 220) = 6.66, p = .247; CFI = .948; TLI = .896; RMSEA = .039; and SRMR = .045) (four items: χ2 (2, N = 220) = 1.19, p = .552; CFI = 1.000; TLI = 1.000; RMSEA = .000; and SRMR = .017) (Lewis, Milletich, Derlega, & Padilla, 2014). During its scale development, internal consistency reliability was found to be Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .82 (Herek et al., 2009a) among a large sample of SMIs. Internal consistency reliability has been consistently found to be between Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .78 and .89 (Kelley et al., 2014; Lassiter, 2013; Lea et al., 2014; Lewis et al., 2014; Mason et al., \t\t86 2015; Mereish & Poteat, 2015) across a wide range of sexual minority identities. The IHP-R was even found to have a negative correlation with experiencing homophobic verbal abuse (r = -.10, df = 569, p = .019), and a positive correlation with perceived stigma (r = .20, df = 568, p < .001) (Lea et al., 2014). Baseline and follow-up survey scores were found to be highly correlated (r = .67), demonstrating test-retest reliability. When compared to the full nine-item, gay male-specific version of the IHP (Herek, Cogan, Gillis, & Glunt, 1998), a similar internal consistency reliability score was found (𝛼 = .85) and scores were found to be highly correlated (r > .90) for all assessed sexual orientation groups (lesbian, gay, bisexual).  Taken altogether, these findings illustrate the validity of the IHP-R, as these are concepts directly related to the theoretical aspects of internalized homophobia. After controlling for victimization and demographic variables, the IHP-R was found to contribute significantly to the amount of variance explained to well-being and psychological distress as assessed by global self-esteem, depressive symptoms, stated anxiety, and positive affect (Herek et al., 2009a). Significant positive associations were also found with a model including internalized homophobia, as measured by the IHP-R, with depressive symptoms (β = .20/b = .15 (.05), [.04 - .25], p < .01) (Lassiter, 2013).  Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire The Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ; Van Orden et al., 2012) was utilized for the purpose of operationalizing and measuring suicidal ideation through the constructs of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness (see Appendix K). The INQ takes approximately five to six minutes to complete. The Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire is listed on the PsycTEST database with its permission for use clause \t\t87 (2012).  The INQ is listed as allowed for use in regards to “non-commercial research and educational purposes without seeking written permission” (2012, p. 1).  The 15-item INQ (Van Orden et al, 2012) utilizes a 7-point Likert-type scale for participants to respond to, which range from “Not at all true for me” (1) to “Very true for me” (7). It is comprised of two subscales, one being the 6-item PB subscale, which operationalized the degree to which one feels like a liability on those around them. Perceived burdensomeness (PB) subscale scores were found by summing all of its responses. Total PB subscale scores could possibly range from 6 to 42, with higher scores equating to a higher degree of PB for the individual.  The second subscale of the INQ is the 9-item thwarted belongingness subscale (Van Orden et al., 2012), which operationalized the degree to which one feels lonely or unsupported by others in their life. The TB subscale has six items that required reverse coding, after which the score of the subscale was found by summing all of its responses. Total TB subscale scores could possibly range from 9 to 63, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of TB for the individual.   As a means to operationalize and measure the last dependent variable, suicidal ideation, the INQ total score was used (Van Orden et al., 2012). Total INQ scores were found by summing both of the subscale scores, which could possibly range from 15 to 105 with higher scores indicating higher degree of suicidal ideation. It should also be noted that research has demonstrated that simply inquiring about current or past suicidality (or its related constructs) for a person does not encourage or increase the presence of current suicidal thoughts or behaviors (Gould et al., 2005). Therefore, using a scale like the INQ does not pose a threat of harm to those who participate.  \t\t88 The INQ has gone through five different versions (10, 12, 15, 18, and 25-items), each finding varying degrees of internal consistency (Hill et al., 2015). Hill et al. (2015) recommended utilizing the 10-item or 15-item version, as they were found to have the most consistent and best model fit in their confirmatory factor analysis. Due to the 15-item version of the INQ being relatively new, there are few studies that have utilized this specific version with SMIs and even fewer who have reported their own psychometric properties.  Studies that have utilized the new 15-item version of the INQ have demonstrated the psychometric properties among various groups, including undergraduate students from Hill et al. (2015) (internal consistency 𝛼 = .85 to .90; TB Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .81 to .87: concurrent predictive validity with the Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire R2 = .337 to .588, p <.001) and Kacmarski, Hicks, and Rings (2014) reporting (PB Cronbach’s \t𝛼 = .95; TB Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .89), as well as adult outpatient individuals (PB Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .91; TB Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .90: Hawkins et al., 2014). Silva et al. (2015) found excellent internal consistency in their study on suicide risk among sexual minority college students (PB Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .91; TB Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .93). They also found a significant quadratic relationship for PB (β = - .56, t(137) = -3.78, p < .001, pr = -.31) and suicidal ideation (β = -.56, t(137) = -3.81 p < .001, pr = -.31).  In addition, the INQ was examined for concurrent and predictive validity with the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS; Beck & Steer, 1991). Results of the concurrent validity revealed that greater odds of suicidal ideation were associated with higher PB (odds ratio [OR] = 2.21, p < .01) and TB (OR = 1.59, p < .01; Van Orden et al., 2012) subscale scores. The predictive validity illustrated that higher degrees of both PB and TB \t\t89 were associated with greater odds of reporting suicidal ideation one month later (respectively— OR = 1.64, p < .01; OR = 1.83, p < .01). Hill et al. (2015) ran models examining PB, TB, and suicidal ideation and found in one sample of college student that 33.7 to 41.1% of the variance for their models accounted for suicidal ideation, while in a second sample of college students the variance explained was 49.7 to 58.8%.  In regards to the INQ-15 for both of these samples, PB and TB were significantly found to be independent predictors of suicidal ideation, while the interaction effect of PB and TB was also a significant predictor of suicidal ideation. Kacmarski et al. (2014) found the interaction effect of PB and TB to be a significant predictor of suicidal ideation (β = .461, t(110) = 2.057, p = .040).  Such results demonstrate support for PB and TB as being proximal causes for suicidal ideation.  Data Handling and Analysis Data handling for this study included the initial collection and storage on the secure Qualtrics (2015) server. Data were, and will continue to be, only accessible to the principal investigator and the research advisor as a means to keep the data intact. After data collection was complete, the data were exported from the secure Qualtrics server (2015) to an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Office, 2011), where it was cleaned, organized, and reverse-coded where necessary. Again, as a means to ensure anonymity, no directly identifiable information was collected (e.g., name, social security number, or IP address). The e-mail addresses collected for the raffle entry were stored in a separate Excel file. This Excel spreadsheet file was only stored on the principal investigator’s computer, which was password-protected at all times.  \t\t90 The cleaned and organized data were then exported into SPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp., 2016), where missing values were coded through a Transform command that recoded the old values into a new and easily identifiable value of 999. The data file was password-protected in order to maintain the integrity of the data. The password-protected SPSS data file was stored on a private Dropbox account. Dropbox is a web-based electronic file-sharing application that allows files to be securely saved and accessed by the account owner via the Internet. Dropbox secures files by using a 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt all files, a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) during transportation of files between apps, and a two-step verification process in order to gain access to an account.  In SPSS (IBM Corp., 2016), a preliminary analysis was conducted and included a computation and inspection of descriptive statistics for accuracy. This descriptive analysis included calculations of means, standard deviations, and outliers. Psychometric analyses for the scales were then executed. After evaluating the amount of missing data, the researcher decided that imputations were not the best option, and instead deleted the small number of cases missing less than 10% of the data. In addition, if any one case was missing more than 10% of data, that case was removed from the study. Details regarding this process are discussed in Chapter IV. After assessing the descriptive statistics and the psychometric properties of the measures, the study’s research questions and hypotheses were then tested.  The following research questions were developed in an effort to best explore the study’s aims.  The hypotheses were derived in an attempt to most accurately \t\t91 operationalize these research questions. Research questions 4 through 4d were exploratory in nature, as a means to assess possible differences.  Q1  How much variance in thwarted belongingness is uniquely vs. jointly explained by the degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for sexual minority individuals?  \tH1 The degree of prejudicial experiences (as assessed by SOV total scores), rejection sensitivity (as assessed by GRRS-M average scores), visibility management (as assessed by LGB-VMS total scores), and internalized homophobia (as assessed by IHP-R average scores) will significantly predict the degree of thwarted belongingness (as assessed by TB subscale scores on the INQ).     A multiple linear regression was used to find the best prediction equation for this model. This analysis allowed for an assessment of how much variance for the dependent variable was uniquely (solely) vs. jointly (combined) explained by the independent variables. The dependent variable was thwarted belongingness, and the independent variables were degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for the current sample. An alpha of .05 was used to determine statistical significance.  Q2   How much variance in perceived burdensomeness is uniquely vs. jointly explained by the degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for sexual minority individuals?  H2 The degree of prejudicial experiences (as assessed by SOV total scores), rejection sensitivity (as assessed by GRRS-M average scores), visibility management (as assessed by LGB-VMS total scores), and internalized homophobia (as assessed by IHP-R average scores) will significantly predict the degree of perceived burdensomeness (as assessed by PB subscale scores on the INQ).   A multiple linear regression was used to find the best prediction equation for this model. This analysis allowed for an assessment of how much variance for the dependent \t\t92 variable was uniquely vs. jointly explained by the independent variables. The dependent variable was perceived burdensomeness, and the independent variables were degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for the current sample. An alpha of .05 was used to determine statistical significance.  Q3 How much variance in suicidal ideation is uniquely vs. jointly explained by the degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for sexual minority individuals?  H3 The degree of prejudicial experiences (as assessed by SOV total scores), rejection sensitivity (as assessed by GRRS-M average scores), visibility management (as assessed by LGB-VMS total scores), and internalized homophobia (as assessed by IHP-R average scores) will significantly predict the degree of suicidal ideation (as assessed by INQ total scores).     A multiple linear regression was used to find the best prediction equation for this model. This analysis allowed for an assessment of how much variance for the dependent variable was uniquely vs. jointly explained by the independent variables. The dependent variable was suicidal ideation, and the independent variables were degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for the current sample. An alpha of .05 was used to determine statistical significance.  Multiple linear regressions do have certain assumptions that should be met, including the assumptions of normality, outliers, non-linearity, and heteroscedasticity and multicollinearity. The data were analyzed to assess if these assumptions were met. If an assumption was violated, further analysis and possible corrections to the data were then conducted.  Q4 To what degree are four of Meyer’s (2003) SMS constructs (prejudicial experiences, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and \t\t93 internalized homophobia) experienced among different sexual minority groups?  Q4a Does the degree of prejudicial experiences differ among various sexual minority identities?  H4a Based on the results of an independent samples t-test, those who identify as non-LG (i.e., bisexual, pansexual, asexual, other) will score significantly higher on the Sexual Orientation Victimization measure (SOV: D’Augelli et al., 2008), a measure of prejudicial experiences, in comparison to those who identify as lesbian or gay (LG).   A two-tailed independent samples t-test was used to examine for possible differences in degree of prejudicial experiences between lesbian and gay (LG) individuals and those sexual minorities who identified as non-LG (e.g., asexual, bisexual, pansexual). Differences in sexual orientation identity, as was assessed by demographic items, allowed for the differentiation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, and other sexual minority identities. There were similar rates of responses between those who identified as LG and non-LG, therefore an independent samples t-test was utilized. An alpha level of .05 was used to determine statistical significance.  Q4b Does the degree of rejection sensitivity differ among various sexual minority identities?  H4b Based on the results of an independent samples t-test, those who identify as lesbian or gay (LG) will score significantly higher on the Gay-Related Rejection Sensitivity Scale-Modified (GRRS-M; Feinstein et al., 2012), a measure of rejection sensitivity, in comparison to those who identify as non-LG (i.e., bisexual, pansexual, asexual, other).   A two-tailed independent samples t-test was used to examine for possible differences in degree of rejection sensitivity between lesbian and gay (LG) individuals and non-LG individuals. Differences in sexual orientation identity, as assessed by demographic items, allowed for the differentiation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, and other sexual minority identities. There were similar rates of responses between those \t\t94 who identified as LG and non-LG, therefore an independent samples t-test was utilized. An alpha level of .05 was used to determine statistical significance. Q4c Does the degree of visibility management differ among various sexual minority identities?  H4c Based on the results of an independent samples t-test, those who identify as non-LG (i.e., bisexual, pansexual, asexual, other) will score significantly higher on the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Visibility Management Scale (LGB-VMS: Lasser et al., 2010b), a measure of visibility management, in comparison to those who identify as lesbian or gay (LG).   A two-tailed independent samples t-test was used to examine for possible differences in degree of visibility management between lesbian and gay (LG) individuals and non-LG individuals. Differences in sexual orientation identity, as assessed by demographic items, allowed for the differentiation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, and other sexual minority identities. There were similar rates of responses between those who identified as LG and non-LG, therefore an independent samples t-test was utilized. An alpha level of .05 was used to determine statistical significance.  Q4d Does the degree of internalized homophobia differ among various sexual minority identities?  H4d Based on the results of an independent samples t-test, those who identify as non-LG (i.e., bisexual, pansexual, asexual, other) will score significantly higher on the Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale (IHP-R; Herek et al., 2009b), a measure of internalized homophobia, in comparison to those who identify as lesbian or gay (LG).   A two-tailed independent samples t-test was used to examine for possible differences in degree of internalized homophobia between lesbian and gay (LG) individuals and non-LG individuals. Differences in sexual orientation identity, as assessed by demographic items, allowed for the differentiation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, and other sexual minority identities There were similar rates of \t\t95 responses between those who identified as LG and non-LG, therefore an independent samples t-test was utilized. An alpha level of .05 was used to determine statistical significance. After data analysis was fully conducted, all password-protected data files were transferred onto a flash drive and removed from both Dropbox and the principal investigator’s computer. The flash drive will then be kept under lock and key by the principal investigator for three years per UNC IRB rules.  Summary  The principal investigator posed a study that would allow for a better understanding of the impacts of the Sexual Minority Stress model (SMS; Meyer, 2003) on the degree of suicidal ideation through the lens of Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS; Joiner, 2005). This quantitative, cross-sectional, non-experimental design utilized surveys to collect data from sexual minority individuals (SMIs) from across the country. Specifically, through the use of measures, the independent variables of the SMS model and the dependent variables of the ITS were collected, stored, and analyzed through Qualtrics (2015) and SPSS (IBM Corps., 2016). This chapter outlined the study’s methodology through the description of the study design, the sample, as well as the procedures, which outlined: recruitment strategy, informed consent, survey distribution, instrumentation, and data handling and analysis for each research question.    \t\t96    CHAPTER IV DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS This chapter presents the results of the current study. The first section describes the characteristics of the sample. The second section is a report of the descriptive statistics and reliability analyses for each measure used. The last section describes the findings of the tested hypotheses for the current study. Sample Participant recruitment took place from May to December 2016. Of the 265 participants who began this study, 64 participants were excluded due to not meeting the inclusion criteria or for not completing the survey. More specifically, 60 participants were removed for missing more than 10% of the data. Next, two were removed for identifying as heterosexual, one participant was removed for being under the age of 18, and one was removed for living outside of the United States.  For those remaining (n = 201), six participants were missing one datum a piece. Two of the missing items were by design for this study in the Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale (IHP-R; Herek et al., 2009b; see Appendix J). The design of this study provided participants with the option to skip any items that did not apply to them in the IHP-R. Two participants opted to skip one item (IHP-R Item 2). As these items were missing by design, they were not considered missing items and instead had their final scores adjusted to reflect the true average of the four items they responded to.  \t\t97 With four remaining items missing, it was then necessary to assess the pattern of the missing data. The pattern is considered very important in research, for if the data were missing not at random (MNAR) there would be a negative impact on the generalizability of the results of the study (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). A Little’s Test for Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) was used in the current analysis to test if the remaining four items were missing completely at random. The estimation maximization option was then selected prior to running the analysis. This test failed to reject the null hypothesis (p = .072) in the current study, concluding that the four missing items could be considered missing completely at random. After assessing this pattern, this investigator was then able to assess what steps would be appropriate to deal with the missing data.\tWhile there are yet to be firm guidelines in place for how much missing data is considered tolerable for a sample, Tabachnick and Fidell (2007) stated that if 5% or less of the data points are missing and are missing completely at random (MCAR) “almost any procedure for handling missing values yields similar results” (p. 63). The four cases missing one datum each represented approximately 2% of the sample, and the four missing items represented < 1% of the data. Deletion of cases so that only completed cases are used in analysis is deemed a reasonable choice if there are few cases that have missing data and they are missing at random (2007). Given that (a) there were only a few cases of missing items, (b) the items were found to be MCAR, and (c) utilizing an analysis with complete cases allows for rich outputs, it was deemed appropriate by this investigator to delete the four cases that had one missing datum each. This resulted in a final sample of 197 participants.  \t\t98 The demographic characteristics of sexual orientation, gender identity, race/ethnicity, and persons who the participants have come out to are presented in Table 1. The final sample included participants from 27 states and the District of Columbia. The 27 states were spread across the five regions of the U.S. (National Geographic Society, 2009), with 97 (49.1%) from the Midwest, 51 participants (25.9%) from the West, 32 (16.2%) from the Southeast, eight (4.1%) from the Southwest, seven (3.5%) from the East, and two (1%) preferred not to answer. Ages for the participants ranged from 18 to 68 years old (M = 27.1 years; SD = 10.1 years). One hundred percent of the participants reported that they have come out to at least one other person. In addition, 66 (33.5%) participants reported a history of attempting suicide, reporting a range from 1 to 20 attempts (M = 2.34; SD = 2.81).      \t\t99 Table 1 Summary of Demographic Characteristics (n = 197) Characteristic  n % Sexual Orientation      Lesbian 33 16.8    Gay 52 26.4    Bisexual 43 21.8    Pansexual 34 17.3    Asexual 12 6.1    Other 23 11.7 Gender Identity      Man 54 27.4    Woman 88 44.7    Transgender Man 18 9.1    Transgender Woman 4 2.0    Other 33 16.8 Race/Ethnicity      Caucasian/White 154 78.2    Latina/o 9 4.6    African American 2 1.0    Asian 5 2.5    Other Race or Ethnicity  2 1.0    Multi-Racial/Ethnic 23 11.7 Disclosed sexual orientation to       Parent(s) 131 66.5    Sibling(s) 130 66.0    Cousins 80 40.6    Aunt(s)/Uncle(s) 76 38.6    Best friend(s) 186 94.4    Other individual(s) not listed 81 41.1  Descriptive Statistics and Reliability  Analyses for the Measures  Sexual Orientation Victimization  Scale  The Sexual Orientation Victimization Scale (SOV; D’Augelli et al., 2008; see Appendix G) was used to operationalize and measure the degree to which one has experienced prejudice or discrimination due to their sexual orientation. A summary of the \t\t100 SOV’s scores is presented in Table 2. Participants who completed the SOV (n = 197) had scores that ranged from 0 to 18 (M = 4.7, SD = 4.17), with acceptable (+/-2; Field, 2013) criteria for skewness (1.33, SE = .172) and kurtosis (1.38, SE = .341). It is important to note that that 12.2% of the sample reported no perceived instances of sexual orientation victimization, and on average indicated low frequencies of victimization (M = 4.7; SD = .297). The Shapiro-Wilks test indicated that the responses were non-normally distributed (p < .001). For the current study, a reliability analysis was conducted for the SOV using Cronbach’s 𝛼. Overall, the SOV had a good level of internal consistency for this sample, as determined by a Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .83.  Table 2 Summary of the Sexual Orientation Victimization Scale Scores (n = 197)   n M (SD) Possible Range Reported Range Skewness Kurtosis  SOV Scores 197 4.67 (.297) 0 to 18 0 to 18 1.33 1.43  Gay-Related Rejection Sensitivity Scale – Modified   The Gay-Related Rejection Sensitivity Scale – Modified (GRRS-M; Feinstein et al., 2012; see Appendix H) was used to operationalize and measure the degree to which one expects to be rejected by others due to their sexual orientation. A summary of the GRRS-M’s scores is presented in Table 3. Participants who completed the GRRS-M (n = 197) had scores that ranged from 2.25 to 35.50 (M = 15.24, SD = 0.497), with acceptable (+/-2; Field, 2013) criteria for skewness (.398, SE = .173) and kurtosis (-.324, SE = .345). The Shapiro-Wilk’s test indicated that the responses were non-normally distributed (p = \t\t101 .01). Overall, the GRRS-M scores had an excellent level of internal consistency for this sample, as determined by a Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .93.  Table 3 Summary of the Gay-Related Rejection Sensitivity – Modified Scores (n = 197)   n M (SD) Possible Range Reported Range Skewness Kurtosis  GRRS-M Scores 197 15.24 (.497) 1 to 36 2.25 to 35.50 .398 -.324  Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Visibility  Management Scale  The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Visibility Management Scale (LGB-VMS; Lasser et al., 2010b; see Appendix I) was utilized for the purpose of operationalizing and measuring the degree to which one conceals or reveals their sexual identity. A summary of the LGB-VMS’s total scores, as well as the Active Behavioral, Inhibitive Behavioral, and Setting subscale scores, are presented in Table 4. Participants who completed the LGB-VMS (n = 197) had total scores that ranged from 40 to 157 (M = 101.55, SD = 1.72), with acceptable (+/-2; Field, 2013) criteria for skewness (-.365, SE = .173) and kurtosis (-.218, SE = .345). It is also important to highlight that LGB-VMS scores indicated a high degree of openness in the visibility management for this sample (M = 101.6; SD = 1.72). The Shapiro-Wilks test indicated that the responses were non-normally distributed (p = .015). A reliability analysis demonstrated that the LGB-VMS had an excellent level of internal consistency for this sample with a Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .95. The LGB-VMS Active Behavioral and Inhibitive Behavioral subscales both also demonstrated excellent internal consistency for this sample, with Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .91 and \t\t102 .94, respectively. While the Setting subscale had a questionable level of internal consistency for this sample, with a Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .65.   Table 4 Summary of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Visibility Management Scale Scores (n = 197)   n M (SD) Possible Range Reported Range Skewness Kurtosis  LGB-VMS Scores 197 101.55(1.72) 28 to 168 40 to 157 -.365 -.218       Active Behavioral 197 40.45 (.761)   -.177 -.395      Inhibitive Behavioral 197 53.92 (1.01)   -.541 -.349       Setting  197 7.18 (.139)   1.12 .173  Revised Internalized  Homophobia Scale  The Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale (IHP-R; Herek et al., 2009b; see Appendix J) was used to operationalize and measure the process of internally directing antigay attitudes towards oneself. An additional sentence (“If you feel the item does not apply to you, you may skip the item”) was added to the instructions for this scale to allow for inclusivity. In kind, two participants who opted to skip one item (IHP-R Item 2: “I have tried to stop being attracted to the same sex in general”). As these items were missing by design, they were not considered missing items and instead had their final scores adjusted to reflect the average of the other four items they responded to.  A summary of the IHP-R’s scores is presented in Table 5. Participants who completed the IHP-R (n = 197) had scores that ranged from 1.0 to 4.2 (M = 1.77, SD = 0.05), with acceptable (+/-2; Field, 2013) criteria for skewness (1.01, SE = .173) and kurtosis (.741, SE = .345). It is important to note that 27.4% of this sample reported the \t\t103 lowest possible IHP-R score. The Shapiro-Wilks test indicated that the responses were non-normally distributed (p < .001). A reliability analysis was conducted on the IHP-R. Overall, the IHP-R demonstrated questionable to acceptable internal consistency for this sample, as determined by a Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .694.

A summary of the INQ’s scores is presented in Table 6. INQ total scores ranged from 15 to 99 (M = 43.09, SD = 1.47). PB subscale scores ranged from 6 to 42 (M = 14.54, SD = .682). TB subscale scores ranged from 9 to 57 (M = 28.54, SD = .887).  The total score was within acceptable (+/-2; Field, 2013) criteria for skewness (.574, SE = .173) and kurtosis (-.800, SE = .345). The Shapiro-Wilks test indicated that the responses were non-normally distributed (p < .001). A reliability analysis found the INQ to have excellent internal consistency for this sample, determined by a Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .96. The TB and PB subscales were also found to have excellent internal consistency for this sample, with Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .93 and .95, respectively.  \t\t104  Table 6 Summary of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire Scores (n = 197)   n M (SD) Possible Range Reported Range Skewness Kurtosis  INQ Scores 197 43.09 (1.47) 15 to 105 15 to 99 .574 -.800        PB Subscale 197 14.54 (.682) 6 to 42 6 to 42 1.017 .037        TB Subscale 197 28.54 (.887) 9 to 63 9 to 57 .374 -.912  Statistical Analyses for the Research  Questions and Hypotheses  Preparation for the Data Analysis  All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp., 2016). All statistical procedures were performed at an 𝛼 = 0.05 level in order to decrease the risk of committing Type I error. The assumptions of regression were tested prior to each hypothesis test for H1 through H4d.  Research Question 1 Q1  How much variance in thwarted belongingness is uniquely vs. jointly explained by the degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for sexual minority individuals?    Hypothesis 1 H1 The degree of prejudicial experiences (as assessed by SOV total scores), rejection sensitivity (as assessed by GRRS-M average scores), visibility management (as assessed by LGB-VMS total scores), and internalized homophobia (as assessed by IHP-R average scores) will significantly predict the degree of thwarted belongingness (as assessed by TB subscale scores on the INQ).     \t\t105 First, the assumptions of regression were tested prior to the hypothesis test for H1. The assumption of normality was tested, and with a Shapiro-Wilk’s result of p < .001, the null hypothesis of normality was rejected. The dependent variable (TB) then went through a square root transformation, resulting in a Shapiro-Wilk’s test of p = .472. The VIF was used to test for multicollinearity. There were no VIF values greater than 1.47 in the transformed or non-transformed data. Since the VIF values were not larger than 10, and also not substantiality greater than 1, there was no evidence of significant multicollinearity (Field, 2013). Independence was evaluated based on the Durbin-Watson statistic, resulting in 1.907 (1.933 for non-transformed data). Durbin-Watson values between 1 and 3, especially those closer to 2, are considered to meet the assumption of independent errors. Visual examination of the residual histogram supported that the transformed and non-transformed data met the assumption of homoscedasticity.  Next, correlations between all H1 variables were computed as presented in Table 7. TB scores were significantly correlated with SOV scores (r = .154, p = .015), GRRS-M scores (r = .155, p = .015), LGB-VMS scores (r = -.405, p < .001), and IHP-R scores (r = .234, p < .001). SOV scores were significantly correlated with GRRS-M scores (r = .245, p < .001) and IHP-R scores (r = .219, p < .001). GRRS-M scores were significantly correlated with LGB-VMS scores (r = -.192, p = .003) and IHP-R scores (r = .240, p < .001). Lastly, LGB-VMS scores were also significantly correlated with IHP-R scores (r = -.503, p < .001).    \t\t106 Table 7  Correlation Matrix for H1 Variables (n = 197)   TB SOV GRRS-M LGB-VMS  IHP-R TB --     SOV .154* --    GRRS-M .155* .245*** --   LGB-VMS -.405*** .053 -.192** --  IHP-R .234*** .219*** .240*** -.503*** -- Note.

A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to assess if SOV, GRRS-M, LGB-VMS, and IHP-R scores predicted TB scores. For H1, regression analyses were conducted for both the transformed and non-transformed TB scores; this was not found to make any significant difference to the overall amount of variance explained by the model. The findings reported here are for the non-transformed scores for ease of reporting, which are presented in Table 8. This model utilized forced entry for the variable entry method, meaning that all variables were entered into one block. Then the regression was computed. R2 for the overall model was 19.7% with an adjusted R2 of 18.0%, a very small to small effect according to Cohen (1988). The combined H1 variables were statistically significant in their prediction of TB scores, F(4, 192) = 11.746, p <.001, adj. R2 = .180. The regression model demonstrated that the effects of SOV (β = .173, p  = .014) and LGB-VMS (β = -.419, p  <.001) were significant predictors of TB scores at the 0.05 level. The unique variability of the significant predictors SOV and LGB-VMS contributed 15.0% to the \t\t107 model, while the four predictors combined to contribute the remaining 3.0%, the joint variability of the model.

The Beta weights describe the relationship between TB and each predictor, which are also presented in Table 8. The Beta weights for H1 indicate that for every one-point increase in SOV scores among the sample, TB increased by .515 points, when the GRRS-M, LGB-VMS, and IHP-R scores were held constant. For every one-point increase in LGB-VMS scores among the sample, TB decreased by .216 points, when the SOV, GRRS-M, and IHP-R scores were held constant. This hypothesis was supported. Research Question 2 Q2   How much variance in perceived burdensomeness is uniquely vs. jointly explained by the degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for sexual minority individuals?  Hypothesis 2 H2 The degree of prejudicial experiences (as assessed by SOV total scores), rejection sensitivity (as assessed by GRRS-M average scores), visibility management (as assessed by LGB-VMS total scores), and internalized homophobia (as assessed by IHP-R average scores) will significantly \t\t108 predict the degree of perceived burdensomeness (as assessed by PB subscale scores on the INQ).        First, the assumptions of regression were tested prior to the hypothesis test for H2. The assumption of normality was tested and with a Shapiro-Wilk’s result of p < .001, the null hypothesis of normality was rejected. The dependent variable (PB) then went through a square root transformation, a log transformation, and a reciprocal transformation all resulting in a Shapiro-Wilk’s test of p < .001. The VIF was used to test for multicollinearity. There were no VIF values greater than 1.47 in the transformed or non-transformed data. Since the VIF values were not larger than 10, and also not substantiality greater than 1, there was no evidence of significant multicollinearity (Field, 2013). Independence was evaluated based on the Durbin-Watson statistic, resulting in 1.919 for non-transformed scores. Durbin-Watson values between 1 and 3, especially those closer to 2, are considered to meet the assumption of independent errors. Visual examination of the residual histogram supported that the non-transformed data were the closest to meet the assumption of homoscedasticity.  Next, correlations between all H2 variables were computed as presented in Table 9. PB scores were significantly correlated with SOV scores (r = .171, p = .008), GRRS-M scores (r = .166, p = .010), LGB-VMS scores (r = -.297, p < .001), and IHP-R scores (r = .258, p < .001). SOV scores were significantly correlated with GRRS-M scores (r = .245, p < .001) and IHP-R scores (r = .219, p < .001). GRRS-M scores were significantly correlated with the LGB-VMS scores (r = -.192, p = .003) and IHP-R scores (r = .240, p < .001). Lastly, LGB-VMS scores were also significantly correlated with IHP-R scores (r = -.503, p < .001).  \t\t109 Table 9  Correlation Matrix for H2 Variables (n = 197)   PB SOV GRRS-M LGB-VMS  IHP-R PB --     SOV .171** --    GRRS-M .166** .245*** --   LGB-VMS -.297*** .053 -.192** --  IHP-R .258*** .219*** .240*** -.503*** -- Note.

A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to assess if SOV, GRRS-M, LGB-VMS, and IHP-R scores predicted PB scores. For H2, regression analyses were conducted for the transformed and non-transformed PB scores, this was not found to make any significant difference to the overall amount of variance explained by the model. The findings reported here are for the non-transformed scores for ease of reporting, which are presented in Table 10.  This model utilized forced entry for the variable entry method, and the regression was computed. R2 for the overall model was 13.2% with an adjusted R2 of 11.4%, a very small effect according to Cohen (1988). The H2 variables were statistically significant in predicting of PB scores, F(4, 192) = 7.302, p <.001, adj. R2 = .114. The regression model demonstrated that the effects of SOV (β = .151, p = .037) and LGB-VMS (β = -.250, p = .002) were significant predictors of PB scores at the 0.05 level. The unique variability of the significant predictors SOV and LGB-VMS contributed 6.5% to the model, while the four predictors combined to contribute the remaining 4.9%, the joint variability of the model. \t\t110 Table 10 Model Summary and Coefficients of the Multiple Linear Regression Analysis Examining the Impacts of H2 Predictor Variables on Perceived Burdensomeness (n = 197)   Variable r2 Adj r2 B SE B β t p Model  .132 .114a       (Constant)   19.828 4.629  4.284 .000*  SOV   .346 .165 .151 2.095 .037*  GRRS-M   .083 .098 .060 .843 .400  LGB-VMS   -.099 .032 -.250 -3.132 .002*  IHP-R   1.089 1.046 .085 1.041 .299 Note.

The Beta weights for H2 indicate that for every one-point increase in SOV scores among the sample, PB scores increased by .346 points when the GRRS-M, LGB-VMS, and IHP-R scores were held constant. For every one-point increase in the LGB-VMS among the sample, PB scores decreased by .099 points, when the SOV, GRRS-M, and IHP-R scores were held constant. This hypothesis was supported.  Research Question 3 Q3 How much variance in suicidal ideation is uniquely vs. jointly explained by the degree of prejudicial experiences, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia for sexual minority individuals?  Hypothesis 3 H3 The degree of prejudicial experiences (as assessed by SOV total scores), rejection sensitivity (as assessed by GRRS-M average scores), visibility management (as assessed by LGB-VMS total scores), and internalized homophobia (as assessed by IHP-R average scores) will significantly predict the degree of suicidal ideation (as assessed by INQ total scores).     \t\t111 First, the assumptions of regression were tested prior to the hypothesis test for H3. The assumption of normality was tested and with a Shapiro-Wilk’s result of p < .001, the null hypothesis of normality was rejected. The dependent variable (INQ) then went through a log transformation, resulting in a Shapiro-Wilk’s test of p = .309. The VIF was used to test for multicollinearity. There were no VIF values greater than 1.47 in the transformed or non-transformed data. Since the VIF values were not larger than 10, and also not substantiality greater than 1, there was no evidence of significant multicollinearity (Field, 2013). Independence was evaluated based on the Durbin-Watson statistic, resulting in 1.89 (1.938 for non-transformed data). Durbin-Watson values between 1 and 3, especially those closer to 2, are considered to meet the assumption of independent errors. Visual examination of the residual histogram supported that the transformed scores met the assumption of homoscedasticity.  Next, correlations between the all H3 variables were computed as presented in Table 11. INQ scores were significantly correlated with SOV scores (r = .173, p = .008), GRRS-M scores (r = .170, p = .008), LGB-VMS scores (r = -.383, p < .001), and IHP-R scores (r = .261, p < .001). SOV scores were significantly correlated with GRRS-M scores (r = .245, p < .001) and IHP-R scores (r = .219, p < .001). GRRS-M scores were significantly correlated with LGB-VMS scores (r = -.192, p = .003) and IHP-R scores (r = .240, p < .001). Lastly, LGB-VMS scores were also significantly correlated with IHP-R scores (r = -.503, p < .001).     \t\t112 Table 11  Correlation Matrix for H3 Variables (n = 197)   INQ SOV GRRS-M LGB-VMS  IHP-R INQ --     SOV .173** --    GRRS-M .170** .245*** --   LGB-VMS -.383*** .053 -.192** --  IHP-R .261*** .219*** .240*** -.503*** -- Note.

A multiple linear regression was conducted to assess if SOV, GRRS-M, LGB-VMS, and IHP-R scores predicted INQ scores. For H3, regression analyses were conducted for both the transformed and non-transformed INQ scores, this was not found to make any significant difference to the overall amount of variance explained by the model. The findings reported here are for the non-transformed scores for ease of reporting, which are presented in Table 12.  This model utilized forced entry for the variable entry method, and the regression was computed. R2 for the overall model was 18.7% with an adjusted R2 of 17.0%, a very small to small effect according to Cohen (1988). The H3 independent variables were statistically significant in their prediction of the INQ scores, F(4, 192) = 11.028, p < .001, adj. R2 = .170. The regression model demonstrated that SOV scores (β = .175, p = .013) and LGB-VMS scores (β = -.370, p  <.001) were significant predictors of INQ scores at the 0.05 level. The unique variability of these significant predictors contributed 12.4% to the model, while the four predictors combined to contribute the remaining 4.6%, the joint variability of the model. \t\t113 Table 12 Model Summary and Coefficients of the Multiple Linear Regression Analysis Examining the Impacts of H3 Predictor Variables on the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (n = 197)   Variable r2 Adj r2 B SE B β t p Model  .187 .170a       (Constant)   67.579 9.641  7.009 .000*  SOV   .862 .344 .175 2.501 .013*  GRRS-M   .150 .204 .051 .733 .464  LGB-VMS   -.315 .066 -.370 -4.775 .000*  IHP-R   .697 2.179 .025 .320 .749 Note.

The Beta weights describe the relationship between INQ and each predictor, which are also presented in Table 12. The Beta weights for H3 indicate that for every one-point increase in SOV scores among the sample, INQ scores increased by .862 points (p = .014), when the GRRS-M, LGB-VMS, and IHP-R scores were held constant. For every one-point increase in the LGB-VMS scores among the sample, INQ scores decreased .315 (p < .001), when the SOV, GRRS-M, and IHP-R scores were held constant. This hypothesis was supported. Research Question 4 Q4 To what degree are four of Meyer’s (2003) SMS constructs (prejudicial experiences, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and internalized homophobia) experienced among different sexual minority groups?  Research Question 4a Q4a Does the degree of prejudicial experiences differ among various sexual minority identities?     \t\t114 Hypothesis 4a H4a Based on the results of an independent samples t-test, those who identify as non-LG (i.e., bisexual, pansexual, asexual, other) will score significantly higher on the Sexual Orientation Victimization measure (SOV: D’Augelli et al., 2008), a measure of prejudicial experiences, in comparison to those who identify as lesbian or gay (LG).  The assumptions for H4a were tested. Independent samples t-tests assume a lack of extreme outliers, normal distribution of the dependent variables, and equal variable variance. There were no extreme outliers in the data, as assessed by visual inspection of the boxplot. SOV scores for each level of LG and non-LG groups were non-normally distributed, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p < .001). A square root, log, and reciprocal transformation of SOV scores were computed, none of which met the assumption of normal distribution, as assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p < .05 for all). Given that the original SOV scores had acceptable (+/-2; Field, 2013) criteria for skewness (LG 1.21, SE = .261; non-LG 1.443, SE = .228) and kurtosis (LG 1.041, SE = .517; non-LG 1.831, SE = .453), and that an independent-samples t-test is fairly robust from deviations in the assumption of normality, the original scores were used to test this hypothesis. In addition, SOV scores demonstrated homogeneity of variances among LG and non-LG participants, as assessed by Levene’s test for equality of variances (p = .696). A two-tailed independent samples t-test was used to examine possible differences in degree of sexual orientation victimization encountered among lesbian and gay (LG) individuals versus those who identify as non-LG (see Table 13). There were 85 LG and 112 non-LG participants in this sample. On average, LG participants reported higher SOV scores (M = 4.94, SD = 4.022) than non-LG participants (M = 4.46, SD = 4.287). \t\t115 However, this difference was not significant t(195) = 0.794, p = .428, and demonstrated a very small effect size, d = 0.12 (Sawilowsky, 2009). This hypothesis was not supported. The results suggested that among this sample, non-LG individuals did not appear to experience sexual orientation victimization any more often than did LG individuals.   Table 13 SOV Scores for LG and Non-LG Participants (n = 197 combined)   Sexual Orientation n M (SD) Std. Error Mean SOV LG 85 4.94 (4.022) .436 Non-LG 112 4.46 (4.287) .405 Note. SOV = Sexual Orientation Victimization Scale, LG = lesbian and gay, non-LG = bisexual, pansexual, asexual, and other identities.   Research Question 4b Q4b Does the degree of rejection sensitivity differ among various sexual minority identities?  Hypothesis 4b H4b Based on the results of an independent samples t-test, those who identify as lesbian or gay (LG) will score significantly higher on the Gay-Related Rejection Sensitivity Scale-Modified (GRRS-M; Feinstein et al., 2012), a measure of rejection sensitivity, in comparison to those who identify as non-LG (i.e., bisexual, pansexual, asexual, other).  The assumptions for H4b were tested. Independent samples t-tests assume a lack of extreme outliers, normal distribution of the dependent variables, and equal variable variance. There were no outliers in the data, as assessed by visual inspection of the boxplot. GRRS-M scores for LG participants (p = .372) were normally distributed, while scores for non-LG (p = .012) participants were non-normally distributed, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk’s test at the 0.05 level. A square root transformation of GRRS-M scores resulted in a normal distribution, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk’s test for both LG (p = \t\t116 .324) and non-LG participants (p = .611). Given that the original GRRS-M scores had acceptable (+/-2; Field, 2013) criteria for skewness (LG .274, SE = .261; non-LG .501, SE = .228) and kurtosis (LG -.212, SE = .517; non-LG -.337, SE = .453), and that an independent samples t-test is fairly robust from deviations in the assumption of normality, the original scores were considered to be appropriate to use for this analysis. In addition, GRRS-M scores demonstrated homogeneity of variances among LG and non-LG participants, as assessed by Levene’s test for equality of variances (p = .686). A two-tailed independent samples t-test was used to examine possible differences in degree of rejection sensitivity among lesbian and gay (LG) individuals versus those who identify as non-LG. This analysis was conducted for both the transformed and non-transformed scores, which was not found to make any significant difference to the results of the analysis. The findings reported here are for the non-transformed scores for ease of reporting (see Table 14). There were 85 LG and 112 non-LG participants. On average, LG participants reported higher GRRS-M scores (M = 15.79, SD = 7.10) than did non-LG participants (M = 14.83, SD = 6.88). This difference was not significant t(195) = 0.965, p = .336,  and demonstrated a very small effect size, d = 0.14 (Sawilowsky, 2009). This hypothesis was not supported. The results suggested that among this sample, non-LG individuals did not appear to experience rejection sensitivity any more often than did LG individuals.          \t\t117 Table 14 GRRS-M Scores for LG and Non-LG Participants (n = 197 combined)   Sexual Orientation n M (SD) Std.

Research Question 4c Q4c Does the degree of visibility management differ among various sexual minority identities?  Hypothesis 4c H4c Based on the results of an independent samples t-test, those who identify as non-LG (i.e., bisexual, pansexual, asexual, other) will score significantly higher on the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Visibility Management Scale (LGB-VMS: Lasser et al., 2010b), a measure of visibility management, in comparison to those who identify as lesbian or gay (LG).  The assumptions for H4c were tested. Independent samples t-tests assume a lack of extreme outliers, normal distribution of the dependent variables, and equal variable variance. There were no extreme outliers in the data, as assessed by visual inspection of the boxplot. LGB-VMS scores for LG participants (p = .007) were non-normally distributed, while those for non-LG participants (p = .188) were normally distributed, as assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk’s test at the 0.05 level.  A square root, log, and reciprocal transformation of LGB-VMS scores were computed, none of which met the assumption of normal distribution, as assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p < .05 for all). Given that the original LGB-VMS scores had acceptable (+/-2; Field, 2013) criteria for skewness (LG -.717, SE = .261; non-LG .127, SE = .228) and kurtosis (LG .264, SE = .517; non-LG -.222, SE = .453), and that an independent-samples t-test is fairly robust from \t\t118 deviations in the assumption of normality, the original scores were used for this analysis. In addition, LGB-VMS scores demonstrated homogeneity of variances among LG and non-LG participants, as assessed by Levene’s test for equality of variances (p = .902). A two-tailed independent samples t-test was used to examine possible differences in degree of visibility management among lesbian and gay (LG) individuals versus those who identify as non-LG (see Table 15). There were 85 LG and 112 non-LG participants. On average, LG participants reported higher LGB-VMS scores (M = 105.93, SD = 23.293) than did non-LG participants (M = 98.23, SD = 24.328). This difference was significant t(195) = 2.240, p = .026, and demonstrated a small effect size, d = 0.32. The results suggested that among this sample, LG participants appeared to experience higher degrees of visibility management than did non-LG individuals. This is contrary to H4c posing that non-LG individuals would have higher LGB-VMS scores than did LG individuals. Therefore, this hypothesis was not supported.

Research Question 4d Q4d Does the degree of internalized homophobia differ among various sexual minority identities?     \t\t119 Hypothesis 4d H4d Based on the results of an independent samples t-test, those who identify as non-LG (i.e., bisexual, pansexual, asexual, other) will score significantly higher on the Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale (IHP-R; Herek et al., 2009b), a measure of internalized homophobia, in comparison to those who identify as lesbian or gay (LG).  The assumptions for H4d were tested. Independent samples t-tests assume a lack of extreme outliers, normal distribution of the dependent variables, and equal variable variance. There were no extreme outliers in the data, as assessed by visual inspection of the boxplot. IHP-R scores for the LG and the non-LG participants were non-normally distributed, as assessed by a Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p < .001). A square root, log, and reciprocal transformation of IHP-R scores were computed, none of which met the assumption of normal distribution, as assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p < .05 for all). Given that the original IHP-R scores had acceptable (+/-2; Field, 2013) criteria for skewness (LG .982, SE = .261; non-LG .1.040, SE = .228) and kurtosis (LG .667, SE = .517; non-LG .891, SE = .453), and that an independent-samples t-test is fairly robust from deviations in the assumption of normality, the original scores were used in this analysis. In addition, IHP-R scores demonstrated homogeneity of variances among LG and non-LG participants, as assessed by Levene’s test for equality of variances (p = .881). A two-tailed independent samples t-test was used to examine possible differences in degree of internalized homophobia among lesbian and gay (LG) individuals versus those who identify as non-LG (see Table 16). There were 85 LG and 112 non-LG participants. On average, LG participants reported lower IHP-R scores (M = 1.767, SD = .0822) than did non-LG participants (M = 1.769, SD = .0700). This difference was not \t\t120 significant t(195) = -0.016, p = .987, and demonstrated almost no effect size, d = 0.003. This hypothesis was not supported. The results suggested that among this sample, non-LG individuals did not appear to experience internalized homophobia any more often than did LG individuals.

Sample characteristics, descriptive statistics, reliability analyses, and findings for the tested hypotheses were provided. The final sample consisted of 197 participants, which was composed of 85 lesbian and gay-identified (LG) persons and 112 persons who identified as non-LG (i.e., bisexual, pansexual, asexual, other). Of the 197 participants, 100% reported they have disclosed their sexual orientation to at least one other person, and 33.5% reported a history of attempting suicide at least once in the past.  H1, H2, and H3 were tested using a multiple linear regression analysis. The H1, H2, and H3 variables were statistically significant among this sample in their prediction of TB scores, PB scores, and INQ scores, respectively. SOV and LGB-VMS scores were found to be significant and contributed the most unique variance in all three models. H1, H2, and H3 were all found to be supported.  \t\t121 H4a, H4b, H4c, and H4d were tested using two-tailed independent samples t-tests. H4a, H4b, and H4d were not supported. H4c was also not supported, but did have unexpected results with LG participants reporting a greater degree of visibility management than those who identified as non-LG. Next, Chapter V will present a discussion of the results, conclusions, recommendations, unforeseen limitations, implications, and future directions.     \t\t122    CHAPTER V DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH  The literature to date has demonstrated that rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicides are significantly greater among sexual minority individuals (SMIs) than heterosexuals (Haas et al., 2011; King et al., 2008; Richardson, 1995). Despite these alarming trends, there have been relatively few studies that have applied Joiner’s (2005) empirically supported Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS) to the sexual minority population (e.g., Hill & Pettit, 2012; Silva et al., 2015; Woodward et al., 2014), and even fewer (Baams et al., 2015; Plöderl et al., 2014) that have incorporated it with Meyer’s (2003) Sexual Minority Stress (SMS) model. Further, these studies have only assessed one or two of the model’s four sources of stress constructs. As a result, understanding the underlying constructs that may have an impact on the development of sexual minority suicidal ideation was limited. Thus, the current study was sorely needed. This study aimed to provide empirical support that could lead to more efficient suicide prevention and intervention approaches that ultimately may save the lives of SMIs. Specifically, the SMS model (Meyer, 2003) poses that there are four sources of stress constructs experienced by SMIs, which are— experience of prejudicial events, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, and internalized homophobia. The current study examined the impacts that these stress constructs may have on the two ITS \t\t123 (Joiner, 2005) constructs that yield suicidal ideation— thwarted belongingness (TB) and perceived burdensomeness (PB), among SMIs. Furthermore, due to mental health differences found within SMI groups (e.g., Persson, Pfaus, & Ryder, 2015), this study explored possible differences in the degree of SMS between those who identify as lesbian and gay (LG) versus those who identify from a broader range of other sexual orientation identities (e.g., bisexual, asexual, pansexual). Overall, these SMS constructs do appear to have various impacts on PB, TB, and ultimately suicidal ideation. These, and other findings of this study, are discussed and interpreted in greater detail in this chapter.  Discussion of the Results Sexual Minority Stress and  Thwarted Belongingness  For Hypothesis 1 (H1), it was proposed that the SMS constructs of sexual orientation victimization, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia would significantly predict the degree of thwarted belongingness (TB) among this sample of SMIs. The hypothesis was based on findings that these four constructs have been found to have deleterious impacts on sexual minority mental health (Plöderl et al., 2014). These SMS constructs were found to have a significant predictive effect on TB among this sample. The overall model accounted for 18% of the variance in TB, a very small effect size according to Cohen (1988). This indicates that, for this sample of SMIs, the lack of belonging that one feels may be partially predicted by the amount of sexual minority stress they experience. Specifically, both frequency of sexual orientation victimization and degree of openness in their visibility management were found to have significant direct impacts on TB, which combined accounted for 15% of the variance in the overall model. This suggests that of the four SMS constructs, sexual \t\t124 orientation victimization and visibility management appear to play the largest roles in the development of TB among SMIs.   In regards to sexual orientation victimization, the literature has supported a relationship between this type of victimization and worsening interpersonal relationships (Garnets et al., 1990). For example, Silva et al. (2015) posed that victimization, such as being bullied due to one’s sexual orientation, is likely to lead to feeling as though they do not belong. Such negative impacts could lead to a sense of loneliness or even a lack of reciprocally caring relationships, which are two critical dimensions of TB (Van Orden et al., 2010). This study, however, represents the first known direct evidence of sexual orientation victimization having a predictive effect on TB, and thus adding theoretical support for both SMS and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (Joiner, 2005). For example, the results support that experiencing more verbal or physical threats seems to cause a decline in a sense of connection with those around them.  Next to consider is the stress of visibility management, which has been demonstrated to be paradoxical in nature. For instance, someone who tends to conceal their sexual orientation visibility may be doing so as a means to protect themselves against rejection or discrimination in the short-term (D’Augelli & Grossman, 2001), while in the long-term it may prevent them finding a sense of community (Meyer, 2003). Not having a sense of community due to hiding one’s sexual orientation restricts access to social support for this identity. This could create one to have a lack of reciprocally caring relationships and even bring about loneliness, which are aspects of the TB construct (Van Orden et al., 2010). The findings for visibility management in this study demonstrate that as one conceals their sexual orientation, this may cause a weakening in \t\t125 their sense of belonging. This finding was consistent with prior evidence showing a significant correlation between visibility management and a lack of belonging (Plöderl et al., 2014), where being more open about one’s sexual orientation served as a protective factor from suicidal ideation The current findings illustrate that as participants were more open to others about their sexual orientation, they reported a greater sense of belonging. For instance, this suggests that as an SMI is more public with their sexual minority identity, it may lead to having a sense of belonging in a community of people who care about them.   Interestingly, the results of this study did not show evidence of a significant direct effect of rejection sensitivity on TB. This proposed relationship was based on prior evidence that expectations of rejection have been found to impede the social functioning of SMIs (Crocker et al., 1998; Pinel, 2002). The results for this study found that rejection sensitivity did help to contribute to the explanation of one’s sense of belonging, but only when in combination with other SMS factors.   As a possibility, an absence of a significant direct impact here could indicate that the relationship between rejection sensitivity and TB may be indirectly explained instead by sexual orientation victimization and visibility management (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). For example, sexual minority research has demonstrated that experiencing antigay victimization (e.g., threats, physical attacks) leads to increased vigilance to threats in the environment (Lick et al., 2013; Pachankis et al., 2008), and can also lead to SMIs concealing their identity as a means to prevent future victimization (Pachankis, 2007). The current study did not assess for a possible indirect relationship between rejection sensitivity and TB. However, given the discrepancy between the current study’s findings \t\t126 and the prior research, perhaps rejection sensitivity may have a more direct relationship with sexual orientation victimization and visibility management, and thus may be indirectly related to TB. These potential relationships may be of interest for future researchers to investigate.   In addition, the results of this hypothesis test did not show evidence of a significant direct effect of internalized homophobia on TB. Such a relationship was hypothesized based on previous research indicating that increased internalized homophobia (a) was associated with poorer relationship qualities (Cohen & Byers, 2015), and (b) predicted greater psychological distress (Szymanski & Henrichs-Beck, 2014). As with rejection sensitivity, it was found that internalized homophobia helped to explain TB, but only when in combination with other SMS factors.  Once again, a possible explanation for this lack of a significant direct impact here may suggest that the relationship between internalized homophobia and TB may be indirectly explained by sexual orientation victimization and visibility management (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). For example, research posits that experiencing stigmatizing environments and receiving antigay messages (e.g., being gay is immoral and/or is a sin) may lead to an internalization of these messages among SMIs (Meyer, 2003). In addition, SMIs may then conceal their identity as a means to prevent future victimization (Pachankis, 2007). The current study did not assess for a possible indirect relationship between internalized homophobia and TB. However, the discrepancy between the current study’s findings and prior research might suggest that internalized homophobia may have a more direct relationship with sexual orientation victimization and visibility \t\t127 management, and thus may be indirectly related to TB. Future researchers may be interested in examining these potential relationships.  Sexual Minority Stress and Perceived Burdensomeness  In regards to Hypothesis 2 (H2), it was anticipated that the SMS constructs of sexual orientation victimization, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia would significantly predict the degree of perceived burdensomeness (PB) for this sample of SMIs. Plöderl et al. (2014) found these four constructs to have negative impacts on sexual minority mental health, which was in part the basis for this hypothesis. As with H1, the SMS constructs were found to have a significant predictive effect on PB among this sample. The overall model accounted for 11.4% of the variance in PB, a very small effect size according to Cohen (1988). This infers that, for this sample of SMIs, the belief that one is a liability to others is partially predicted by the amount of sexual minority stress that they experience. Similar to the findings for H1, frequency of sexual orientation victimization and degree of openness in their visibility management were both found to have significant direct impacts on PB, which combined to account for 6.5% of the variance. Also similar to H1, these findings further suggest that of the four SMS constructs examined, sexual orientation victimization and visibility management appear to play the largest roles in the development of PB among SMIs. For example, this supports the idea that as an SMI encounters more bullying for being a sexual minority and also attempts to hide their sexual identity, it may cause a belief in that individual that they are a burden. This burdensomeness may be due to the SMI believing that their experiences will send the \t\t128 message to those they are close to take on a protector role as a means to defend the SMI from the stigma they endure.   The current study’s findings for H2 are consistent with prior evidence that demonstrated a relationship between sexual orientation victimization and PB (Baams et al., 2015). Specifically, Baams et al. (2015) found that as frequency of sexual orientation victimization increased, the perception that one is a liability to those around them also increased. This also supports prior research indicating that SMIs self-perceptions of being a burden onto their loved ones may stem from previous experiences of discrimination (Silva et al., 2015). This study noted that previous discrimination may send the message that the SMI is failing to meet societal expectations, such as the expectation to be heterosexual (e.g., disappointing one’s parents because they are not heterosexual) (Haas et al., 2011). In addition, for those who view themselves as failing to reach these societal standards, shame may result (Lewis, 2004), which by itself is a risk factor for suicide found to be associated with PB (Van Orden et al., 2010). In sum, the current study adds to the literature by supporting a predictive relationship where increased frequencies of sexual orientation victimization help predict increases in PB.   Visibility management, as discussed previously, has been found to be paradoxical as it can be viewed as a way to protect oneself from rejection or discrimination (Miller & Major, 2000). Yet, such concealment can become even more stressful in the long-term. Hilton and Szymanski (2011) speculated that SMIs who have disclosed their sexual orientation to family and friends may perceive themselves as a burden to them if they hold the belief that their identity is a stressor onto their loved ones (e.g., now their family or friend feels obliged to advocate for sexual minorities). The findings of the current \t\t129 study suggest that as the participants were more open to others about their sexual orientation, their sense of being a burden onto others was actually lessened. With these findings, it would be reasonable to assume that the disclosure of one’s sexual orientation was not viewed as placing a burden onto those to whom they disclosed. Instead for this sample, disclosing their identity appeared to have been helpful for the SMI to find support in their life. In other words, the results of this study add to the literature by finding that more openness in one’s sexual orientation helps lead to lessened PB.  The results of this study did not show evidence of a significant direct effect of rejection sensitivity on PB, which went against the posited hypothesis. This hypothesized relationship was based on past findings that expectations to be stigmatized due to one’s identity (e.g., sexual orientation) has been found to obstruct one’s social functioning (Crocker et al., 1998; Pinel, 2002). The results for this study found that rejection sensitivity due to one’s sexual orientation did help to explain one’s belief that they are a burden to people in their lives, but only when in combination with other SMS factors.  The lack of a significant direct impact here may possibly suggest that the relationship between rejection sensitivity and PB may be partially explained by sexual orientation victimization and visibility management (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). For example, research has demonstrated that SMIs are prone to rejection sensitivity as a result of experiencing sexual orientation victimization in the past (e.g., verbal threats, physical attacks) (e.g., Baams et al., 2015; Berrill, 1992; Herek et al., 2002; Horn, 2007; Katz-Wise & Hyde, 2012). In regards to visibility management, Baams et al. (2015) found that stress experienced when contemplating to disclose one’s sexual orientation was associated with the expectation of rejection of their disclosure to loved ones. The \t\t130 current study did not assess for possible indirect relationships between rejection sensitivity and PB. Given the discrepancy between the current study’s findings and prior research, perhaps rejection sensitivity may have a more direct relationship with sexual orientation victimization and visibility management, and thus may be indirectly related to PB. Future studies may consider investigating these potential relationships.  Contrary to this hypothesis, the results also did not show evidence of a significant direct effect of internalized homophobia on PB. This relationship had been expected based on previous research noting a correlation between internalized homophobia and PB (Plöderl et al., 2014). As with H1, it was found that internalized homophobia helped to contribute to the explanation of one’s belief that they are a burden to people in their lives, but only when in combination with other SMS factors.  When considering an absence of a significant direct impact here, this might suggest that the relationship between internalized homophobia and PB may be partially indirectly explained by sexual orientation victimization and visibility management (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). For example, there is a demonstrated relationship between experiences of sexual orientation victimization and internalized homophobia for SMIs (Berrill, 1992; Herek et al., 2002; Horn, 2007; Katz-Wise & Hyde, 2012; Szymanski & Henrichs-Beck, 2014). In addition, prior evidence supports that SMIs who conceal their identity due to an inability to overcome stigmatizing societal messages may harbor internalized homophobia (Morris et al., 2001). The current study did not assess for a possible indirect relationship between internalized homophobia and PB. However, the discrepancy between prior research and the current findings might suggest that internalized homophobia may have a more direct relationship with sexual orientation \t\t131 victimization and visibility management, and thus may be indirectly related to PB. Future researchers may be interested in examining these potential relationships.  Sexual Minority Stress and  Suicidal Ideation  Hypothesis 3 (H3) posited that sexual orientation victimization, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia would significantly predict the degree of suicidal ideation (SI) for this sample of SMIs. This hypothesis was partly based on Plöderl et al.’s (2014) findings that SMS constructs have been found to have detrimental impacts SMI mental health, including an increased likelihood for SI. The SMS constructs were found to have a significant predictive effect on SI among this sample. The overall model for H3 accounted for 17% of the variance in SI, which again is a very small effect size according to Cohen (1988). This indicates that, for this sample of SMIs, thoughts of wanting to kill oneself was partially predicted by the amount of sexual minority stress they had experienced. Similar to H1 and H2, both frequency of sexual orientation victimization and degree of openness in their visibility management were found to have significant direct impacts on SI, which together accounted for 12.4% of the variance. Once again, this insinuates that of the four sources of stress constructs, sexual orientation victimization and visibility management appear to play the largest roles in the development of SI among SMIs. An example of this could be seen in a SMI that encounters verbal and physical attacks due to their sexual orientation, and attempts to pass as heterosexual in public settings. These together predict an increased likelihood that this SMI will develop thoughts of wanting to kill themselves.  In regards to sexual orientation victimization, the current findings are consistent with prior evidence illustrating that sexual orientation victimization directly impacts SI \t\t132 among LGB youth (Baams et al., 2015). Specifically, Baams et al. (2015) found that as the frequency of sexual orientation victimization increased among their sample (e.g., more verbal threats, physical attacks), thoughts of wanting to kill oneself also intensified. This study adds to the literature by finding that sexual orientation victimization helps predict suicidal ideation.  In reviewing the visibility management construct, the findings in this study are consistent with Plöderl et al.’s (2014) findings that one’s degree of openness about their sexual identity was negatively correlated to SI. Hiding and concealing one’s sexual orientation has been found to have negative mental health impacts on SMIs (Miller & Major, 2000). The current results demonstrate more than a correlation, however, as more openness with others about one’s sexual orientation helped lead to a decrease in their thoughts of wanting to kill themselves.   In opposition to this posed hypothesis, the results of this study did not show evidence of a significant direct effect of rejection sensitivity on SI. Instead, rejection sensitivity did help to contribute to suicidal ideation, but only when in combination with other SMS factors. This absence of a significant direct impact here may indicate that the relationship between rejection sensitivity and SI instead may be indirectly explained by other variables (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007), such as sexual orientation victimization and visibility management. A possible indirect relationship between rejection sensitivity and SI was not assessed in the current study. Given the discrepancy between the current study’s findings and prior research, perhaps rejection sensitivity may have a more direct relationship with sexual orientation victimization and visibility management, and thus \t\t133 may be indirectly related to SI. These potential relationships may be of interest for future researchers to investigate.   The results of this study also did not show evidence of a significant direct effect for internalized homophobia on suicidal thoughts, which also conflicted with this hypothesis. The relationship was hypothesized based on previous research indicating that internalized homophobia was significantly and directly correlated with suicidal ideation (Plöderl et al., 2014). Internalized homophobia was also positively associated with greater odds of attempting suicide (Livingston et al., 2015). As with H1 and H2, it was found that internalized homophobia did help to contribute to one’s thoughts of killing themselves, but only when in combination with other SMS factors. As a potential explanation for this lack of a significant direct impact here, the relationship between internalized homophobia and SI may be partially explained by sexual orientation victimization and visibility management (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). For instance, findings suggest that victimization based on sexual orientation leads to mental health disparities (Brewster et al., 2015; Brewster & Moradi, 2010; Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Meyer, 2003), including internalized homophobia (Meyer, 2003). In addition, Plöderl et al. (2014) found that openness in visibility of one’s sexual orientation served as a protective factor against suicidal ideation, as those who were more open in this identity experienced less internalized homophobia and more social support than those who were less open about their sexual identity. This possible indirect relationship between internalized homophobia and suicidal thoughts was not investigated in the current study. However, due to the discrepancy between prior findings and the current study’s findings, internalized homophobia may possibly have a more direct \t\t134 relationship with sexual orientation victimization and visibility management, and thus may be indirectly related to suicidal thoughts. Future studies may take these potential relationships into consideration  Sexual Minority Stress According  to Sexual Minority Group   Lastly, this investigator examined possible differences in the degree of each SMS stress construct between those who identify as lesbian or gay (LG) versus those who identify as non-LG (e.g., bisexual, asexual, pansexual). Hypothesis 4 postulated that LG participants would report (4a) higher frequencies of sexual orientation victimization, (4b) higher degrees of rejection sensitivity, (4c) less openness in their visibility management, and (4d) higher degrees of internalized homophobia, all in comparison to non-LG participants. To recap, none of these four hypotheses actually were supported. Specifically, though, for Hypotheses 4a, 4b, and 4d, LG individuals were no more likely to experience sexual orientation victimization, rejection sensitivity, or internalized homophobia than were non-LG individuals.  The absence of differences in frequency of sexual orientation victimization, rejection sensitivity, and internalized homophobia, respectively between LG versus non-LG individuals appear to be inconsistent with the previous evidence suggesting there to be significant mental health disparities found among SMI groups (e.g., Bostwick et al., 2014; Case et al., 2004; King et al., 2008). For example, Persson et al. (2015) reported that non-monosexual women’s (e.g., bisexual women) mental health was significantly worse in comparison to those who identified as lesbian or heterosexual. Due to the reports like Persson et al. (2015), a lack of significant SMS differences was unexpected.  \t\t135 However, for Hypothesis 4c, an interesting result was found. More specifically, LG individuals reported being more visible in their sexual orientation than did non-LG individuals. This demonstrated difference suggests that those who identify as lesbian or gay are more open in their sexual orientation visibility than those who identify as bisexual, asexual, pansexual, or otherwise non-LG. For example, this insinuates that LG identified individuals are less likely to hide their identities, or try to pass as heterosexual in a variety of settings, such as with family, friends, neighbors, or co-workers.  While this was not an expected finding, it may support Greene’s (2003) implication of tension that may exist between those who identify as bisexual versus those who identify as LG. Greene attributed this tension to biphobia that occurs within the sexual minority community. Biphobia, or bisexual prejudice, is the biased perspective that those who identify as bisexual are uncertain in their sexual identity, are greedy, and/or are immature (Wadsworth & Hayes-Skelton, 2015). The tension within the sexual minority community that Greene refers to has been demonstrated to be due to prejudicial attitudes towards bisexual individuals from lesbian- and gay-identified individuals (e.g., Brewster, Moradi, Deblaere, & Velez, 2013; Weiss, 2003). Research demonstrates that experiencing anti-bisexual prejudice is related to negative mental health ramifications. For example, Watson, Velez, Brownfield, and Flores (2016) found that as the numbers of anti-bisexual discrimination experiences increased for bisexual women, increases in disordered eating behaviors, detachment, and drug and alcohol use occurred among them. The current study’s results speak to a more inclusive range of sexual identities than Greene’s study, but the results may still be explained by this tension within the sexual \t\t136 minority community. For example, non-LG individuals may feel more pressure to conceal their identity as they feel judged by both the heterosexual and LG community. Summary of Results and Additional  Theoretical Implications  The results of the current study found that SMS significantly predicted TB, PB, and SI. Given that stress due to one’s sexual orientation is suggested to account for an increased risk in attempting and completing suicide among SMIs (Cochran & Mays, 2000; Garofalo et al., 1999; Hatzenbuehler, 2011; Richardson, 1995), it is unsurprising that these four sources of stress have been found to conjointly explain increases in TB, PB, and SI in this study. In other words, these findings support the notion that as sexual minority stress increases for SMIs, it predicts that (a) their feelings of belonging may decrease by not having a sense of community, (b) they may feel more like a liability to those around them, and in turn they may have increased thoughts of suicide. Overall, this study found evidence to support the negative interpersonal and mental health ramifications of the SMS model due to the results which indicated that increases in sexual orientation victimization predicted increases in one’s lack of belonging, feelings of being a liability onto others, and thoughts of suicide.   The four sources of SMS in the model accounted for the largest amount of variance with the construct of TB (18%) for this sample, in comparison to PB and SI. This suggests that of the ITS constructs, the four sources of stress best explained the degree to which one perceives themselves as not belonging. It should also be noted, however, that the overall models for each hypothesis only accounted for a very small effect size according to Cohen (1988). This finding supports that the SMS constructs may \t\t137 be helpful explaining suicide risk among SMIs, but apparently is not sufficient in its explanation (Plöderl et al., 2014).  In addition, it should also be highlighted that these findings add to the sexual minority stress literature by including SMIs who identify as other than lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB), as these individuals (e.g., asexuals, pansexuals) are often not discussed. Trends in the current literature reflect that studies investigating experiences in the sexual minority population include several that recruited gay-identified individuals, fewer with lesbian-identified individuals (Rust, 2002), fewer yet with bisexual-identified individuals, and the least with those who identified as asexual or an “other” sexual identity (Wadsworth & Hayes-Skelton, 2015). The inclusion of other sexual minority identities in the research is crucial due to significant mental health disparities that have been found among all SMIs, and across differing sexual orientation identities (Case et al., 2004). By including asexuals and pansexuals, there is now evidence of the negative impacts that SMS has on the interpersonal relationships and mental health for SMIs as a more inclusive group. In other words, there is now evidence that as sexual orientation victimization increases and visibility management becomes more concealed for those who identify as asexual and pansexual, feelings of a lack belonging, feelings of being a burden onto others, and thoughts of suicide increase. Overall, the SMS model now has more support for the negative interpersonal and mental health ramifications of the unique stress that is encountered by SMIs, and the ITS (Joiner, 2005) now has more support for its application with the sexual minority population. In addition, it is an ethical and professional imperative in the counseling psychology field to be more inclusive. \t\t138 Advocating for this inclusivity directly relates to the social justice identity of a counseling psychologist (Sue & Sue, 2012).  Practice Implications of the Results  The results of this study provide several practice implications for counseling psychologists. According to the APA practice guidelines for LGB clients (APA, 2012), which provides the basis for multicultural counseling competency when working with sexual minority clients, psychologists should strive to understand the effects that prejudice and discrimination have on SMIs. Psychologists are also encouraged to recognize how their own knowledge about sexual minority issues may be relevant to the assessment and treatment of sexual minority clients. One important factor to consider when gaining knowledge about the sexual minority population is that SMIs experience higher rates of suicidal ideation (e.g., Fowler et al., 1986; Haas et al., 2011; King et al., 2008; Mathy, 2002a) and suicide attempts (Haas et al., 2011) than do heterosexual individuals. Among the current sample, 33.5% of the respondents had attempted suicide at least once in the past, which is higher than the 11.6 to 20% of SMIs that has been reported in recent literature (Hottes, Bogaert, Rhodes, Brennan, & Gesink, 2016; King et al., 2008). As a result, it is important that counseling psychologists work to develop a better understanding of the underlying factors that may influence suicidal ideation among SMIs. The Sexual Minority Stress model (Meyer, 2003) provides a foundation for understanding the basic stressors that SMIs experience as a result of their sexual orientation.  The results of this study demonstrated a predictive effect from the SMS constructs on SMIs’ feelings of thwarted belongingness (TB), perceived burdensomeness (PB), and \t\t139 suicidal ideation (SI). These results support the importance of counseling psychologists’ ability to examine the sexual minority stress that SMIs may have experienced in their lifetime. Counseling psychologists may be able to do this by spending additional time exploring the sexual orientation developmental process that their sexual minority clients have undertaken, such as through the bisexual identity development model (Weinberg, Williams, & Pryor, 1994). While doing so, it allows for a simultaneous approach to investigate possible experiences of sexual orientation victimization (e.g., verbal insults, threats of physical violence, objects thrown at them, physical attacks, sexual assaults, etc.), how open they are about their sexual orientation with others (e.g., have they disclosed their identity to their family, friends, etc.), the extent to which they may expect rejection from those around them due to their sexual orientation, and possible inclinations of internalized homophobia.  Doing this exploration would also allow for the implementation of interpersonal interventions aimed at providing a corrective emotional experience for those who may have been faced with victimization, rejection, and homophobic attitudes. This can be done through providing LGBTQ+ affirming spaces and interactions (Kilgore, Sideman, Amin, Baca, & Bohanske, 2005; Sue & Sue, 2012). For example, a counseling office is able to establish an affirming space by displaying LGBTQ+ materials, such as magazines for SMIs in the waiting room, having pictures of same-sex couples on their walls, and brochures promoting SMI health available for consumption. While such displays may allow for a more affirming space, the reaction from the psychologist, if a sexual minority client were to disclose their sexual orientation, should attempt to also be highly affirming in nature (e.g., demonstrating acceptance, not trivializing their identity, not \t\t140 communicating that it is a form of mental illness). Sue and Sue (2012) provide even more examples on how to be affirming in clinical practice when working with sexual minority clients in Counseling the culturally diverse: Theory and practice (6th ed.).  In addition to being able to provide a corrective emotional experience through LGBTQ+ affirming spaces and actions, gleaning the information about a sexual minority client’s history of SMS may even allow for a better understanding of their risk of suicidal ideation. Such conceptualizations may be especially important if a sexual minority client has already provided indications of experiencing suicidal ideation on their intake paperwork. For example, if the client indicates that they have an extensive history of experiencing victimization based on sexual orientation (e.g., experienced multiple physical attacks), and/or also indicates that they spend a large portion of their energy on managing their visibility by trying to “pass” as heterosexual, the clinician can use this knowledge to understand that the individual may be experiencing a lack of connection, or that they may even feel like a burden to those around them.  In addition to this clinical interview, the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (Van Orden et al., 2012) can be incorporated into an assessment of the client’s sense of belonging and being a burden onto others. Incorporating an objective and efficient measure could be a helpful addition to a thorough and comprehensive risk assessment. It is important to emphasize, though, that a comprehensive risk assessment requires more than the use of objective measure. Granello (2010) outlines crucial aspects that should be considered and utilized in clinical practice in the article The process of suicide risk assessment: Twelve core principles.  \t\t141 Next, collaboration with the sexual minority client may then be very appropriate to identify ways to reduce the impacts of the sexual orientation victimization and visibility management concerns. This could include the incorporation of ameliorative coping strategies. Ameliorative coping strategies serve as an additional construct of Meyer’s SMS model, which refer to a set of strategies to be used in order to make the sexual minority stress easier to navigate (2003). Research supports that SMIs who have such adaptive responses are found to have fewer suicide attempts than those without such adaptive responses (Livingston et al., 2015). The literature also supports that a sense of group cohesion acts as a buffer for protection from the negative mental health impacts that come from minority stress (Clark et al., 1999; Crocker & Major, 1989; Miller & Major, 2000). Incorporating more ameliorative coping strategies could allow for the application of a strengths-based approach aimed to increase one’s sense of belonging and to decrease feeling like a burden onto others.  Ameliorative coping processes can include (a) finding affirming social supports, (b) having family acceptance, (c) gaining a connection with the sexual minority community, and (d) having a supportive, long-term romantic partner (Baams et al., 2015). As a practical example, counseling psychologists can identify a list of referrals for sexual minority support groups, LGBTQ+ organizations in the area, and supportive religious organizations in the community to help their clients to begin searching for more affirming social supports. In addition, utilizing approaches that aim to instill or increase coping mechanisms, resilience, and hardiness have been found to help SMIs to manage both general and minority stress (Masten, 2001). Riggle Whitman, Olson, Rostosky, and Strong (2008) also shared that identifying positive aspects of being a SMI, serving as a \t\t142 positive role model, creating families of choice, and being involved in social activism are some of the ways that resilience and hardiness can be fostered among SMIs.   Another practice implication from these results can be considered from a more preventative lens. Part of the counseling psychologist’s identity is to look beyond interventions that can be used individually, and instead to implement prevention strategies within their community as a whole (Kodet, 2012; Romano & Hage, 2000). Prevention can be approached from a variety of ways; one common form would be through outreach presentations to certain groups. Outreach presentations on diversity issues also allow for counseling psychologists to be agents of change within their community, which is an integral aspect of the social justice identity counseling psychologists hold (Sue & Sue, 2012).   The findings from this study, which support the SMS model having a predictive ability on the intensity of ITS constructs among SMIs, could be incorporated into psychoeducationally-based outreach presentations. For example, such presentations could stress the importance of having a supportive social group to aid SMIs in their ability to be open about their sexual orientation while still feeling safe. In addition, such presentations could also emphasize the importance of having a sense of community as a means to maintain mental health. These presentations could be prepared for those who desire to gain more understanding of the sexual minority community, which could include those who are a part of the community or even for allies who are seeking more knowledge in how they can be supportive and empathic. The Safe Zone Project is an excellent example of such an affirming presentation. This project provides information for free in order to help build presentations that are focused on increasing LGBTQ+ awareness and to \t\t143 provide ally training. The integration of the SMS model and the ITS could be a wonderful addition to these workshops, as they are open for modification. In addition, other presentations could benefit from including this integration such as those associated with Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG; 2017), as well as general presentations meant to address students on college campuses (e.g., new student orientation, introduction into residential life, etc.).  In addition, messages could be sent through these outreach presentations beyond encouraging SMIs from finding an organization to be attached to. For example, it could send a message within the sexual minority community about the importance of reducing bias and stigma within this community, such as verbalizing the importance to challenge a SMI’s prejudice against bisexuals. This message places emphasis on reducing suicidal ideation in the sexual minority community by reducing all prejudice, whether it is from heterosexual individuals or other sexual minorities.   Prevention efforts may also include systems-level interventions that focus on means to increase protective factors and reduce risk factors for sexual minority suicidal ideation (Sue & Sue, 2012). Systems-level interventions may include providing the above outreach presentations at schools, religious organizations, or workplaces. Creating and displaying posters that challenge heterosexism and within-community prejudice, incorporating sexual minority stress literature into diversity curricula at school, or even being available for consultation with friends, parents, or teachers/faculty/staff during difficult conversations around sexual minority issues could all also be practical suicidal ideation prevention efforts that counseling psychologists could provide for SMIs.  \t\t144 Overall, these results suggest that counseling psychologists should utilize both the SMS model and the ITS constructs of PB and TB when assessing for and working with SMIs who are at risk for suicide, and the community within which they interact. By incorporating this understanding, counseling psychologists may (a) better understand the experiences of SMIs and thus increase their multicultural counseling competency when working with sexual minority clients, as well as (b) have the potential to help save lives of SMIs. In addition, providing outreach presentations is a systems approach for counseling psychologists to be agents of change who help increase awareness within, and for, the sexual minority community.  Directions for Future Research One direction for future research elicited from this study comes from the assessment of sexual orientation victimization. This investigator utilized the Sexual Orientation Victimization Scale (SOV; D’Augelli et al., 2008) to operationalize and measure the degree which one has experienced prejudice or discrimination due to their sexual orientation. This measure served well for the purpose of the current study. However, future studies may be able to delve deeper into this construct by assessing for more institutional-level prejudices that many SMIs face. From the enforcing of sodomy laws (Adam, 1987), to becoming targets of antigay violence (Badgett, 1995; Herek & Berrill, 1992b; Human Rights Watch, 2001), to experiencing heterosexism in the workplace (Waldo, 1999), prejudice against SMIs has occurred at various levels of institutionalization. Currently, anti-discrimination laws that are inclusive of sexual orientation, as well as adoption laws for same-sex couples, vary by state. By utilizing the state that the participant reports residing in, an investigator could employ a rubric to rate \t\t145 that state’s level of institutional oppression based on current laws that are deemed prejudicial against SMIs, and/or a lack of laws that protect SMIs. Rating states based on their current laws would allow for a deeper look at the socio-political environment that participants live in, and could bolster support for the SMS construct of prejudicial experiences.   For instance, the Human Rights Campaign (2017) keeps an up-to-date map of state laws and policies on their website at http://www.hrc.org/state_maps. Specifically, this site provides where each state currently stands in regards to legally protecting sexual and gender minority individuals (e.g., employment laws and policies, statewide housing laws and policies, etc.). A researcher could use this information to assign each state a percentage that indicates its level of support for the sexual minority community. An example of this in practice could be in a research study examining the SMS construct of prejudicial experiences. The researcher could go through and create a percentage for each state based on the state’s anti-discrimination, hate-crime, and anti-bullying laws and policies. The states with lower percentages would reflect states that have fewer laws and policies, indicating that they may be maintaining institutional oppression. The percentage could then be utilized as a variable in the analysis. This would allow for the researcher to take prejudice at a systemic level into consideration for their study. Future research can also benefit from incorporating broader recruitment efforts. As the primary means of recruitment, this investigator contacted organizations and groups that aim to support the sexual minority population. By broadening recruitment strategies beyond just these types of organizations or settings, future studies may be able to reach those who are at an earlier stage in their sexual orientation identity development, \t\t146 those who may hold more internalized homophobic attitudes, and those who have not already built an affirming social support system. Examples of such broader recruitment efforts may be through high schools, college settings, and counseling centers that cater to adolescent and/or young adult populations.  Finding organizations that cater to sexual minority persons of color also would be vital in order to broaden future recruitment strategies to be more racially and ethnically inclusive. In fact, common recruitment strategies (e.g., advertising through gay media, using the internet, advertising in LGBTQ organizations, etc.) have been found to result in samples skewed towards those who are white, middle-class, and educated (Clarke et al., 2010). The current sample supports these findings, as 78.2% of the sample identified as Caucasian/White. One of the ways that future researchers may broaden their recruitment strategies could be to include more queer-persons of color organizations (Q-POC), as this could allow researchers to reach a more diverse racial/ethnic sample. Q-POC organizations are becoming more common among local and college communities.  Another future direction would be to broaden recruitment efforts with an intention toward even greater inclusivity regarding sexual orientation and gender identity. While this investigator made several attempts to be inclusive in this quantitative study, future researchers can be even more inclusive in their demographic questionnaires when considering appropriate response options for these salient demographic variables. The current study provided labeled identities for the individuals to choose from, and then an open “Other” category for those who felt the provided labeled identities were not representative of them. By labeling this fill-in section as “Other,” this investigator may have further alienated these individuals from the sexual and gender minority community. \t\t147 By labeling this section as something more inclusive (e.g., “Preferred identity not listed”), future researchers have the ability to make quantitative studies are even more approachable when recruiting those who hold minority identities.   Finally, the results of this study provide support for exploring potential indirect relationships between the SMS (Meyer, 2003) constructs of rejection sensitivity and internalized homophobia and the ITS (Joiner, 2005) constructs of TB, PB, and SI. While past research supports the possibility of direct relationships between rejection sensitivity and TB, PB, and SI (e.g., Crocker et al., 1998; Pinel, 2002), the findings in the current study did not support this. Yet, rejection sensitivity still added to a combined predictive model for TB, PB, and SI, respectively. Perhaps, rejection sensitivity may have a more direct relationship with sexual orientation victimization and visibility management, and thus may be indirectly related to each TB, PB, and SI. Future researchers could investigate a possible mediating and/or moderating effect that rejection sensitivity has on the ITS constructs. For example, future studies could recruit SMIs who experience expectations of rejection, have a prior history of being bullied due to their sexual orientation, and conceal their sexual orientation. In addition, they could also assess the SMIs’ sense of belongingness, their perception of being a liability to those around them, and their suicidal ideation. Then, the researchers could examine the different relationships of the constructs. For example, researchers could explore if expectations of rejection has an indirect relationship with sense of belonging through the variable of sexual orientation victimization.   Similar logic can be applied when considering a possible indirect relationship between internalized homophobia and TB, PB, and SI, respectively. A discrepancy was \t\t148 found in the current study, as past research supports a direct relationship between internalized homophobia and SI (Plöderl et al., 2014), while the current study did not find such a direct relationship. Due to this conflicting result, future researchers should consider examining internalized homophobia as possibly having a more direct relationship with sexual orientation victimization and visibility management, and thus may be indirectly related to each TB, PB, and SI. Future researchers could investigate a possible mediating and/or moderating effect that internalized homophobia has on the ITS constructs. For instance, future studies could recruit SMIs who experience internalized homophobia, have a prior history of being verbally harassed due to their sexual orientation, and attempt to pass as a heterosexual. In addition, they could also assess the SMIs’ sense of belongingness, their perception of being a burden on others, and their suicidal ideation. Then, the researchers could examine the different relationships of the constructs through mediation and/or moderation models. For example, researchers could explore if internalized homophobia has an indirect relationship with suicidal ideation through the variable of visibility management.  Limitations  A few limitations were evident in this study. For one, the current sample had what appears to be an over-representation of those who were more open about their sexual orientation with others, which is not an accurate depiction of the sexual minority population according the recent demographic data. More specifically, according to a 2008 social survey conducted by The Williams Institute out of UCLA (Gates, 2010), more than 5% of LG adults have never told another person about their sexual orientation. In addition, 25% of those who identified as bisexual had never disclosed their sexual \t\t149 orientation to another person. By comparison, the sample for the current study had a 100% rate of having disclosed their sexual orientation to at least one other person.   This over-representation may be due to the kinds of participant recruitment strategies used to obtain the sample. Specifically, this study recruited individuals who were associated with sexual minority community advocacy organizations. This recruitment strategy has been historically found to result in samples of SMIs who are in later stages of sexual orientation identity development (Clarke et al., 2010), and thus may be more open than others. Conversely, this indicates that those who are earlier in this identity development and those who have not already built a sexual minority social support system were not adequately represented in this study. As a result, this over-representation may result in reduced internal and external validity for the current study. While this sample may be strongly representative of those who are active in such organizations, generalizing these results beyond active SMIs should be done so with caution. The broad recruitment strategies discussed in the directions for future research section (e.g., recruiting in different settings such as a college classroom) could help to counteract this limitation. Another limitation of this study is how internalized homophobia was assessed. For the current study, there was a skew in the data that reflected low levels of internalized homophobia for this sample. Internalized homophobia is considered the most insidious of the SMS constructs (Meyer, 2003), making it crucial to have an accurate examination of its impacts on suicidal ideation. This construct is considered especially sinister due to it representing the negative perception one has towards themselves, thus making the stressor internal. While these low levels may be in part due to the participant recruitment \t\t150 strategies, it is also important to consider how internalized homophobia was operationalized. The measure used to assess internalized homophobia, the Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale (IHP-R; Herek et al., 2009b), was appropriate for operationalizing this SMS construct. That being said, assessing this construct may have been strengthened by incorporating additional measures that assessed for the experiences of heteronormativity among SMIs. Since internalized homophobia can result when an individual becomes unable to overcome stigmatizing societal messages (Morris et al., 2001), it is logical to consider incorporating what heteronormative messages SMIs experience when assessing this construct. By expanding the view to include experiences of heteronormativity in future research, investigators may have a more comprehensive means by which to view this construct.  In addition, another possible unforeseen impact on this study may be in part due to the increasingly accepting attitudes towards SMIs within the U.S. A powerful example of this increasing acceptance was demonstrated in June, 2015 when same-sex marriage was legalized by the U.S. Supreme Court (Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015). As previously stated, SMIs experience prejudice at various levels of institutionalization, including within our governing laws (e.g., sodomy laws; Adam, 1987). Though this ruling appears to only apply to those who are in same-sex relationships, findings from state-based legalizations of same-sex marriage earlier on have already demonstrated how such legislative changes can have an undeniably positive impact on sexual minorities as a whole. For example, Raifman, Moscoe, Austin, and McConnell (2017) found that prior to the Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) ruling, states that already had legalized same-sex marriage experienced significant decreases in suicide attempts among sexual minority \t\t151 youth and adolescents post-legalization, while states that had not legalized same-sex marriage did not see such decreases. Raifman et al. (2017) posited possible factors that could account for these differences included that states that had not yet legalized same-sex marriage could be viewed as being structurally stigmatizing toward SMIs. States that had legalized same-sex marriage, however, may have been associated with perceptions of offering increased social support for sexual minority rights. The authors called for policymakers to consider these positive mental health consequences when considering policies related to same sex marriage. In light of the 2015 federal legalization of same-sex marriage, it will be important for future researchers to assess the possible ameliorative effects that this historical reduction of institutional oppression may have on SMIs, including potential reductions in their rates of suicidal ideation and attempts.  Let it be noted that the limitations discussed thus far have been limitations from the perspective of quantitative methodology, as the skews in the sample (a) may decrease the generalizability of the results of this study, and (b) may reduce its internal and external validity. However, when considering the limitations from a more pragmatic counseling psychology perspective, some of these so-called limitations instead rather could be considered strengths. The patterns in the data reflect positive trends within this particular sexual minority sample. This trend appears to be moving towards a more resilient, connected, and open community. When considering this instead from a perspective geared more toward social justice, the high degree of openness that participants expressed regarding their sexual orientation as well as the lower levels of internalized homophobia that they acknowledged feeling may be indicative of a trend towards greater acceptance and affirmation perceived by SMIs within our society as a \t\t152 whole.\t\tAnother possible explanation here may be that such community-based sexual minority advocacy groups are incredibly helpful in building strength, resilience, and a sense of belongingness among their members.   As a final limitation to discuss, this investigator solely utilized self-report questionnaires in assessing the variables for the current study. Due to this, the current study is at risk for common method variance (CMV) that some believe may influence the relationship between the measured variables (Spector, 2006). CMV is the variance that is shared across variables due to assessing them by common techniques (Spector & Brannick, 2009), and has been posited to influence results in regression models (Siemsen, Roth, & Oliveira, 2010). CMV could increase the chance for Type I or Type II error, as CMV allows for possible bias through inflated or deflated relationships between variables (2006). Donaldson and Grant-Vallone (2002) found that a minimum of two data sources is necessary to avoid threats to validity from self-report and mono-method bias. This can be done by having two data sources per construct, such as having two questionnaires that assess each of the SMS and ITS constructs, respectively.  Conclusions The sexual minority population has been found to experience suicidal ideation (e.g., Fowler et al., 1986; Haas et al., 2011; King et al., 2008; Mathy, 2002a) and suicide attempts (Haas et al., 2011) more frequently than heterosexuals. The current sample of SMIs reported that 33.5% of them had attempted suicide at least once in the past, which is higher than the 11.6 to 20% that has been demonstrated in recent literature (Hottes et al., 2016; King et al., 2008). Despite these alarming statistics, there have been relatively few studies that have incorporated Joiner’s (2005) empirically supported Interpersonal \t\t153 Theory of Suicide (ITS) with Meyer’s (2003) Sexual Minority Stress (SMS) model (Baams et al., 2015; Plöderl et al., 2014). This study was sorely needed as it provided more research that examined the underlying constructs behind sexual minority suicidal ideation. Because of this study, the SMS model (Meyer, 2003) now has more support for the negative interpersonal and mental health ramifications of the unique stress that is encountered by SMIs, and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS; Joiner, 2005) now has more support for its application with the sexual minority population. In addition, this study added to the literature. This addition is due to the findings that sexual orientation victimization and visibility management help predict an SMI’s sense of belonging, their perception of being a burden onto others, and possible suicidal thoughts. The findings also provide implications that can strengthen the social justice identity of a counseling psychologist by providing more information that bolsters one’s multicultural counseling competency. Specifically, by gleaning information about a sexual minority client’s history of SMS stress, it may allow for a better understanding of their risk of suicidal ideation. The addition to the interview, and also utilizing the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ; Van Orden et al., 2012), could be worthwhile additions to a thorough and comprehensive suicide risk assessment. Lastly, implications from this study support future research to take a more comprehensive examination at the relationship between the SMS model and the ITS. The current study allowed for the early exploration into the direct relationships of these constructs. The findings demonstrated here allow for a basis to begin building more complex models of understanding the underpinning constructs of suicidal ideation among SMIs. It is hoped that the results from this study \t\t154 may be utilized to provide empirical support that may lead to more efficient suicide prevention and intervention approaches that aim to ultimately save the lives of SMIs.     \t\t155    References Adam, B.

I am a doctoral candidate in Counseling Psychology at the University of Northern Colorado and am conducting research for my dissertation. I’m interested in better understanding the stressors that come to those who identify as sexual minorities, and how the stressors that society puts on these individuals impacts their mental health. My dissertation, entitled The Impacts of Sexual Minority Stress on Degree of Perceived Burdensomeness, Thwarted Belongingness, and Suicidal Ideation has been approved by the University of Northern Colorado’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) and will hopefully help with future suicide prevention efforts among the LGBQ population. I’m writing you today to see if you would be willing to help with this study by forwarding my study request to members of your organization. Specifically, I am looking for participants who are 18 years of age or older and identify in some way as a sexual minority (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, pansexual). The online survey is anonymous and will take approximately 25 minutes of their time. As a way to show my appreciation, I’m offering an opportunity for those who participate to enter into a raffle, with three chances to win $25 Amazon.com gift certificates.   Possible options to distribute this survey include displaying this information on your website, sending this e-mail via your organization’s e-mail listserv, or even posting this e-mail in flyer format. If you agree to distribute this research link, please contact me via e-mail at Caroline.Hicks@unco.edu. Also, if you have any questions for me, or would like further information about this study, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for your time and support.

I believe that by understanding the stress that is put on by society onto those who identify outside of the heterosexual majority, and how that stress impacts mental health, we will better enable others in helping professions to provide more effective and more appropriate services to those who identify as sexual minorities across the country.  In an effort to show my appreciation for your participation, participants will have the option to be entered into a drawing for one of three $25 gift cards.  Participation in this study should take no more than 20 to 30 minutes of your time. Questions will be on a number of topics, including possible experiences with prejudice, your perception of how people may act in regards to your sexual orientation, how open you are about your identity with various people and groups, as well as various mental health difficulties that people experience including depressive symptoms, feelings of hopelessness, feelings of lack of belonging, and feelings of burdensomeness. The risks associated with participation in this study are believed to be no greater than what is normally encountered during a typical day. However, if you are feeling depressed or are having thoughts of suicide, I encourage you to seek assistance as soon as possible. Included within the study as well is a list of mental health resources for you to contact if need be. \t\t203 Your responses will be completely anonymous. Nobody, including myself, will be able to figure out who you are and how you responded. If you choose to enroll in the drawing, there is a remote possibility that your email address could be potentially identifying. Your confidentiality will be kept, as your contact information will be asked in a separate, unlinked survey that is only accessible by the Principal Investigator who will be conducting the drawing. This information will be housed in an encrypted file by the Principal Investigator and will be destroyed after the drawing is complete. If you are at least 18-years-old, identify as a non-heterosexual, speak English, and you choose to participate, please answer each survey item truthfully until you get to the end. If you would like a summary of the results of the study, please send an email to Caroline.Hicks@unco.edu requesting the study results and I’ll send you a summary by email when they’re available. If you choose to request a summary of the result, your contact information will only be used to send the summary and any possible connection that you were a participant will be kept strictly confidential. This study has received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the University of Northern Colorado. Participation is voluntary. You may decide not to participate in this study and if you begin participation you may still decide to stop and withdraw at any time. Your decision will be respected and will not result in loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. By continuing to the survey, you have given your consent to participate in this study. If you have any concerns about your selection or treatment as a research participant, please contact Sherry May, IRB Administrator, Office of Sponsored Programs, 25 Kepner Hall, University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, CO, 80639, 970-351-1910.

    "abstract": "As rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicides within the sexual minority population have surpassed those of heterosexuals, it has become crucial for researchers and counseling psychologists to better understand the unique stress that sexual minority individuals experience. The present study examined the impact that sexual minority stress had on two constructs of the interpersonal theory of suicide, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, as well as on suicidal ideation among a sample of sexual minority adults (n = 197). Three multiple linear regressions were conducted to assess if the sexual minority stress constructs of sexual orientation victimization, rejection sensitivity, visibility management, and internalized homophobia had a predictive ability in the models. Results for all three models showed that the four sexual minority stress constructs combined to help predict the degree of each thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and suicidal ideation. More specifically, results in all three models also demonstrated that of the four constructs, sexual orientation victimization and visibility management had a significant direct effect on the degree of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and suicidal ideation, respectively. In addition, two-tailed independent sample t-tests were used to examine possible differences for each sexual minority stress construct among lesbian and gay participants versus non-lesbian and gay participants (i.e., bisexual, asexual, pansexual, other). An unexpected result was found in that lesbian and gay participants reported being more visible in their sexual orientation than did non-lesbian and gay participants. Overall, the results provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between the sexual minority stress model and the interpersonal theory of suicide, and suggest that their integration may play an important role in assessing and understanding sexual minority suicide risk",
