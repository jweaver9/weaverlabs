Biographical Sketch  Jean Vermette is an activist and transgender woman, born in Maine and educated in the Skowhegan school system, Coburn Classical Institute in Waterville, and Beal College in Bangor, where she earned a paralegal degree. She is the founding director of the Maine Gender Resource and Support Service (Megress).  Megress was a professional, educational, informational, consulting, and referral organization working to help Maine’s transgender and intersex communities. The organization educated or consulted with over 8,000 students, nurses, social workers, psychologists, counselors, doctors, educators, administrators, customers, and neighbors.   Jean won the Maine Lesbian Gay Political Alliance (MLPGA) “Great Pioneer Award” in 2000, “for achievement that embodies bold new vision or courageous breakthrough in our struggle for equality.” (MLPGA became EqualityMaine in 2004.)  In 2007, Jean provided testimony against LD 1589, An Act to Prohibit the Use of Opposite-Gender Bathrooms, Changing Rooms, and Locker Rooms. The bill would have made it a crime for a person to use a public bathroom, changing room or locker room that was designated for use by a gender different than the gender the person was assigned at birth. LD 1589 died in committee.  Because of her work defeating LD 1589, Jean received EqualityMaine’s “Out Front Award” in 2008. The Out Front Award goes to volunteers “who show tremendous leadership in their work for equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.”  In helping to educate the Maine Human Rights Commission—which was itself developing guidelines for schools on how to comply with the Maine Human Rights Act 3 Jean Vermette Papers Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer+ Collection Jean Byers Sampson Center for Diversity University of Southern Maine Libraries regarding gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students—Jean conducted research on a number of topics relating to GLBT youth. These materials can be found in Series 2.   Description of the Papers  The Jean Vermette Papers contain correspondence, publications, audio/visual media, legal briefs, books, and material ephemera dating from 1970 to 2011, with the bulk of the material originating from the 2000s.  The Papers are divided into five series:  Series 1. Personal Files  The first series contains items relating to the life of Jean Vermette. There are event programs for the awards she won—the “Great Pioneer Award” from 2000 and the “Out Front Award” in 2008—plus her acceptance speeches. Jean’s sexual reassignment surgery journal, titled Je me souviens, is in this series, published in 1999 by the Maine Gender Resource and Support Service.  Series 2. Transgender Legal Work & Research  This series contains research and correspondence regarding transgender rights, legal cases, conferences, journals, and organizations’ policies. There are proceedings for the First through the Fifth International Conferences on Transgender Law and Employment Policy. There are also National Gay And Lesbian Task Force policy papers; International Conference on Transgender Law employment policies; National Transgender Advocacy Coalition newsletters; and Transgender Law And Policy Institute college and university policies. There are also newsletters from Phyllis Randolph Frye, a lawyer specializing in LGBT rights, whose emails Jean printed and kept for records. Frye used the pseudonym “Phyllabuster” in many of her newsletters.  In helping to educate the Maine Human Rights Commission, Jean conducted research on a number of topics relating to LGBT youth:  School Policies  Transgender Athletes – Student Athletes and Beyond  Youth Transgender Discrimination and Harassment  Trans Youth Survey Results  Transgender Health and Wellness Research, focused on Youth Some emails re: MHRC research and presentation materials have been restricted.    4 Jean Vermette Papers Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer+ Collection Jean Byers Sampson Center for Diversity University of Southern Maine Libraries Of note are two court cases Jean followed: Littleton v. Prange and Goins v. West Group.  Littleton v. Prange: Christie Lee Littleton legally married Jonathan Mark Littleton. Jonathan died in 1996 as the result of alleged medical malpractice by Dr. Mark A. Prange. Mrs. Littleton, along with the decedent’s mother and the decedent’s children by a previous marriage, filed suit for the wrongful death of Mrs. Littleton’s husband against Dr. Prange. In the course of discovery, Dr. Prange’s counsel became aware that Mrs. Littleton’s birth certificate stated, “Lee V. Cavazos, Jr., a male, born March 29, 1952.” Littleton’s malpractice suit was dismissed by the court based on the fact that her original birth certificate stated she was a male.  Goins v. West Group: Julienne Goins was told she could not use the women’s restroom after transferring to a new workplace. She opposed the directive, resigned, and sued West Group for sexual orientation discrimination and hostile work environment in violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act.  Series 3. LGBTQ+ Publications and Print Material  This series contains publications and print material that Jean collected over time, focusing on LGBTQ+ support, culture, and history. There are four issues of “Transgender Tapestry” and one issue of “The Journal of Gender Studies.” There is a program booklet for the 25th anniversary remembrance of Charles O. Howard, a gay man murdered in Bangor in 1984, and a 1997 copy of “Chrysalis.” Also included: a selection from a friend’s surgery journal, a mailer for the Haworth Press catalog of transgender support books, and three dice-like blocks labeled with gender identity and sexual orientation terms (found in box 7).  Series 4. A/V Material  This series contains audio and visual material in various media. “Mani’s Story,” a 2002 documentary, follows the story of Mani Bruce Mitchell, an intersex person, who visits the United States to attend an ISNA Conference in Milwaukee. There, she gives a presentation about her family history and biography—while also reconnecting with her sister. Jean Vermette appears in the 2009 documentary “Gender Outside the Box,” a collection of interviews with individuals in Maine who transcend the traditional boundaries of male and female. “The Way Life Should Be: Marriage in Maine” is a 2007 documentary film that follows the relationships of three same-sex couples as they discuss wanting to get married in Maine, but could not at the time. “The Gay Marriage Thing” is a 2005 documentary that presents differing opinions and beliefs of Massachusetts residents as they approach May 17, 2004, the first day same-sex couples could receive marriage licenses in MA.

DVD: The Gay Marriage Thing: A Film by Stephanie Higgins [2005] 17 Jean Vermette Papers Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer+ Collection Jean Byers Sampson Center for Diversity University of Southern Maine Libraries Run time: 47 minutes Directed by Stephanie Higgins. Distributed by The Cinema Guild, Inc. “The Gay Marriage Thing is a compelling documentary about the politics, the piety and the people embroiled in and affected by the same-sex marriage debate. By focusing on regular Americans on both sides of the issue, this documentary captures what gets lost in most news reports, the human emotions behind the headlines, and in the process, puts a human face on the social struggle of our time. “The film introduces us to Gayle and Lorre, thirty-something college sweethearts who recently marked their fifteenth anniversary. As they wait for May 17, 2004—the first date same-sex couples could file for marriage licenses in Massachusetts—we witness the chaos that swirls around them—from pro- and anti-gay rallies outside the State House to the chambers of State Representative Kathi-Anne Reinstein—and we see the emotional and spiritual toll it’s taking on their lives. “With an array of opinions from church, state, and everyone in between, this is a film that people of all opinions can watch together. The Gay Marriage Thing is designed to foster dialogue and discussion about an issue that deep down affects us all.”   DVD: The Way Life Should Be: Marriage in Maine [2007] Run time: 11 minutes Produced by: Maine Civil Liberties Union, EqualityMaine, Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders Three same-sex couples tell their stories of living in Maine, where in 2007 marriage equality had not yet passed.
