Gazingaround the packed high-school au-ditorium at the rainbow of facesgathered to hear a keynote on lead-ership and intersectionality, I foundmyself tearing up. In my day, manyof these young people would likelyhave been spending time in psychi-atric facilities or similar programsdesigned to, if not “cure,” at leastcurb and closet their gender andsexual non-conforming expres-sions. Three decades later, here wasthis spirited group publically con-vened to discuss how best to leadan increasingly visible LGBTQyouth population.       After years of denial and era-sure, popular media representa-tions of LGBTQ lives now abound.Gender and sexually non-conform-ing youth can find reflections ofthemselves and their experiencesacross a vast range of social forums.While this might be cause for opti-mism among those of us who valuediverse lives and wish to see anend to the exclusionary and injuri-ous hatred that LGBTQ people suf-fer, mental health statistics suggesta more complicated story. In thepast decade, suicide has replacedhomicide as the second leadingcause of death among youth aged15-24 (accidents are the leadingcause). LGBTQ youth are three tofive times more likely to attemptsuicide than their straight peers.Mental health experts note thatthese alarming rates are only thetip of the iceberg: suicidal ideationis the surface expression of a sub-merged glacier of extreme fear, dis-tress, anxiety, isolation, lowself-worth, self-harm, substanceabuse, body-image issues, and re-lationship violence. Despite popu-lar culture and a politicalenvironment of heightenedLGBTQ awareness – a zeitgeist of “itgets better” – for many LGBTQyouth everyday life is fraught withexperiences that threaten their so-cial, psychological, and physicalwell-being.       While LGBTQ youth are atgreater risk than their straightpeers in most areas of mentalhealth trauma, as a group, theyare disproportionately emergingas some of the most innovative,inclusive, and effective leaders innew social justice movements. Aseducators in Jesuit Catholic col-leges and universities, how do weengage with the pain and suffer-ing, as well as the promising po-tential, of LGBTQ students inways that move beyond toleranceto a full expression of cura person-alis? How do we avoid the tendency to victimize and pathol-ogize these students and, instead,attend to enhancing their full per-sonhood? A first step is recogniz-ing the complexity ofcontemporary LGBTQ youth ex-perience; a related step is cultivat-ing an educational atmosphere ofthriving inclusion – an environ-ment in which LGBTQ students(and I would extend this to staffand faculty) experience opportu-nities for genuine belonging. Suchan environment reflects a deeplyconsidered understanding of theperpetual prejudice that we faceas gender and sexual minorities,as well as an appreciation for theunceasingly creative ways inwhich we forge ourselves in theliminalities of the spaces fromwhich we have been historicallyerased, rejected, or caricatured.       Why are LGBTQ youth atsuch high risk? This group shareswith other minoritized groupswhat psychologists call minoritystress syndrome. Everyday cir-cumstances in which a person isnot only made to feel different,but must relentlessly gauge andnavigate safety, the right to ex-pression, and the necessity ofmaking others comfortable intheir presence is exhausting. Theeffects of this emotional labor onwell-being are exacerbated in en-vironments in which the minori-tized person is isolated fromothers who share their perspec-tives and experiences. Dependingon the socio-cultural demograph-ics of a setting, many people andgroups experience this (for exam-ple, persons of color in predomi-nantly white spaces). In suchsituations, the healthy person cal-ibrates a resilient sense of self byLGBTQ Mental HealthBy Jodi O’Brien1O'Brien: LGBTQ Mental HealthPublished by e-Publications@Marquette, 201838 CONVERSATIONS ON JESUIT HIGHER EDUCATION                                                                                                                                          psychologically referencing theirplace of belonging in the groupswith which they identify. In otherwords, despite exclusion fromdominant groups, they experi-ence a sense of interior homethrough family and community.        Additional psychic distressoccurs when the minoritized per-son is excluded from family andcommunity. Family and faithcommunities are among the mostsignificant sources of psychologi-cal resilience and/or trauma. Ac-ceptance through family and faithestablishes a sense of belongingthat serves as the foundation forwell-being and healing in themidst of external marginalizationand violence. Rejection by familyand faith casts the minoritizedperson adrift, leaving them atmuch greater risk of injury andtrauma. Rejection from familyand faith is a typical experiencefor LGBTQ youth, especiallythose from religious back-grounds. When gender and sexu-ally non-conforming religiousyouth are exiled from family andchurch – often the only home theyknow – and they must also wres-tle with the implications of beingspun off from their faith-basedsystem of meaning. Parents andreligious leaders are often themost significant source of self andsocial understanding for youngpeople. The message that there isno place for them in this constel-lation of family and community –other than through self-erasureand/or a cloak of shame – is dev-astating for LGBTQ youth.        The anguish of this strugglefor self-understanding may ac-tually be complicated by height-ened visibility in popularculture and social media. En-hanced representation ofLGBTQ lives and experiencesdoes not necessarily alleviatethe confusion and distress ofgender and sexually non-con-forming youth; in the search formeaning and belonging, the gulfbetween the family and churchthat are rejecting you and thelifestyle offered in commerciallydriven media may seem impos-sible to navigate. As a result,LGBTQ youth are at consider-able risk of intra- and inter-psy-chological drowning as they tryto steer their way through thesecurrents of exclusion.2Conversations on Jesuit Higher Education, Vol. 54, Iss. 1 [2018], Art. 18https://epublications.marquette.edu/conversations/vol54/iss1/18                                                                                                                                                                                                               39       The good news is that highereducational environments oftenserve as a raft of safety forLGBTQ youth as well as potentialmaps for reconciliation with fam-ily and faith. In the best of cir-cumstances, college life offers anopportunity to develop a sense ofself and community that miti-gates some of the unsettling con-sequences of stigma andrejection. Supportive educationalenvironments offer students op-portunities to recover fromtrauma and to develop self-un-derstanding and forms of com-munication that enable them toreach back effectively into thecommunities that have rejectedthem. Jesuit Catholic universityeducation is especially well-suited to providing LGBTQ stu-dents with experiences ofcommunity-supported healingand, most importantly, the toolsfor forging bridges back to familyand faith. Factors that contributeto this include opportunities tolearn about LGBTQ histories, cul-tures, and experiences. Facultyand staff mentors with sufficientexpertise, rather than just thosewho are well-intentioned, are keyrole models whose own experi-ences offer signposts of hope andmaps of healthy lives. Throughengagement with these mentorsand participation in LGBTQ-cen-tered courses, clubs, and co-cur-ricular activities, studentsencounter knowledge and storiesthat help them to author theirown sense of being and belong-ing along lines that offer hopefulpossibilities for reconciliationwith family and faith. Tools forself-discovery and self-determi-nation that include compassion-ate reflections on family and faithare key components not only forrobust mental health, but for es-tablishing a bright moral com-pass by which to navigate theoften overwhelming waves ofpopular culture.        Extensive evidence gatheredthrough the Family AcceptanceProject at San Francisco State in-dicates that family acceptance ofLGBTQ members results in sig-nificantly higher happiness, re-silience in the face of adversityand discrimination, healthy rela-tionships, and robust engage-ment in family, community,career, and faith. Many LGBTQyouth reconcile family and faiththrough their college experiences.As they find their course throughthe tides of exile, stigma, and dis-crimination, many of these stu-dents are forging voices ofleadership that promise new di-rections through some of thetroubling concerns for their gen-eration. For instance, the group ofLGBTQ youth leaders gatheredin the high-school auditoriumwere there to discuss ways tocombat the “myth of hook up cul-ture.” Popular culture has mademuch of the “hook up” culture ofcasual sex that young people aresupposedly caught up in. Armedwith solid research, these LGBTQleaders were pointing out thatsexual activity among youth hasbeen declining steadily in recentyears. Further, the so-called hookup culture appeals only to a verysmall segment of college stu-dents, with many students pre-ferring to opt out. They wantedto get the word out to young peo-ple who, with only popular cul-ture as their guide, might be suf-fering in shame and silencethinking that they are abnormalin their desire not to engage in ca-sual sex. For these student lead-ers, this message was especiallyimportant for gender and sexu-ally non-conforming youth whoalready have enough misinfor-mation to manage about them-selves and their lives.        I was encouraged andmoved by the compassionate andintelligent way in which theseLGBTQ leaders were elevatingthe conversation about healthysexual choices and relationshipsto new levels. In providing com-munity and tools for family andfaith reconciliation, JesuitCatholic colleges and universitiescan contribute significantly to ad-vancing the positive mentalhealth and reducing the risk ofinjury and depression amongLGBTQ youth. We also havemuch to learn from these LGBTQyouth leaders about finding ourway through the pain, confusion,and anger of rejection and exclu-sion to a place of generous en-gagement and genuine inclusion.
