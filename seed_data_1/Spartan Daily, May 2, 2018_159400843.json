The group stood in solidarity with Spartan Shops workers who will have to reapply for their jobs when a third-party company takes over food service operations at SJSU.  As previously reported by the Spartan Daily, Spartan Shops will be replaced by a third-party company on July 1. Chief Financial Officer Charlie Faas issued a request for proposal to, “enhance food service operations at San Jose State.” Faas was unavailable to respond to the Spartan Daily’s request for comment.United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS) and Spartan Shops student employees held a press conference to highlight the demands of student workers.

According to Time Magazine, May Day or International Workers’ Day emerged in the late 1880s when thousands of men, women and children were suffering from poor working conditions and long hours. Some unions believe 2018 is no different. On Tuesday, workers across the nation marched to bring awareness to workers’ rights and demanded better working conditions. Billy DeFrank LGBTQ Community Center, Services Immigrant Rights and Education Network, the Aztec dance group Calpulli Tonalehqueh and other organizations were in attendance. The Latino Caucus, which is a part of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) 521, were at the May Day rally to sign attendees up for union membership. “A lot of Latinos that come from Mexico, South America and Central America have less rights that they are aware of,” SEIU Chairwoman of the San Jose Chapter Rachel Subega said. “A lot of them work in restaurants, and a lot of them don’t get paid a living wage. A lot of them are undocumented, so they are willing to work for less wages, which isn’t right.” According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly earnings of Latinos 16 years and over in 2017 was $655.This was significantly less than the next less paid group, African-Americans, who earned $682. Asians were the highest earning minority group, with a median weekly earning of $1,022.Latinos are not the only minority struggling in the workplace, according to Gabrielle Antolovich, who serves as a board president at the Billy DeFrank LGBTQ Community Center.  “A lot of people do not want to hire someone who is openly gay,” Antolovich said. “Throughout the 1970s I couldn’t get a job because no one wanted to hire an openly gay person.”Antolovich hopes to partner with NOVA Job Center to have a job center inside the Billy DeFrank center to help LGBTQ people get jobs. It was reported by Out and Equal Workplace Advocates that one in four LGBTQ employees reported experiencing employment discrimination in the last five years and in 28 states, employees can get fired just for being LGBTQ. The Calpulli Tonalehqueh, whose name translates to “community of guardians who accompany the sun,” led protesters down Santa Clara Street. San Jose resident Pedro Perez, otherwise known by his Aztec name Aquihua, said the dance group was there to “lead with medicine and good prayer.” According to history.com, May Day is an official holiday in 66 countries. Marches and protests to commemorate May Day took place globally in countries including France, Cuba, the Philippines, Pakistan and Russia.Although May Day is rarely recognized in the United States, President Grover Cleveland officially moved the celebrated day to the first Monday in September, which is known as Labor Day. Cleveland feared International Workers’ Day would build support for communism and other radical causes, as stated in Time magazine.Student workers concernedabout Spartan Shops’ futureLABOR | Page 2MARCHING IN SOLIDARITYBY SAVANNAH HARDINGPHOTO EDITORDelphina Rodriguez, also known by her Aztec name Xochipiloni, from the Aztec dance group Calpulli Tonalehqueh dances after the International Workers’ Day parade.SAVANNAH HARDING | SPARTAN DAILYJP Sanchez of Anakbayan Silicon Valley speaks about Filipino workers at the end of the International Workers’ Day parade.

It is part of larger organizations, Getting to Zero and Getting to Zero Silicon Valley. SJSU to Zero creates more avenues for students to have healthy conversations for health in general. There are other components that could increase chances of sexual infections.HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The virus attacks the body’s immune system, specifically T cells that help the body fight off infections, according to hiv.gov.There is no cure for HIV. It can be controlled with medication and, if left untreated, can turn into AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. It is mostly spread through bodily fluids and shared needles.SJSU to Zero was one of four organizations that received a mini-grant. The group was awarded $20,000 out of the $71,489 grant, according to a press release by Silicon Valley to Zero. The purpose of the mini-grants are to provide financial assistance to help each organization achieve its goals of combating HIV stigma. Students are able to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the Student Wellness Center. However, after April, there is a fee of $12 for HIV testing. Jennifer Johal, a SJSU to Zero health educator, said Getting to Zero’s mission is to prevent new HIV cases and decrease stigma around HIV. “The way that we kind of incorporate that into what we do is we do a lot of student outreach,” Johal said. “We’re out on Seventh Street every week and we’re talking about HIV prevention medication, specifically PrEP and PEP.”PrEP is pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is used when a person is at a high risk for HIV to lower his or her chances, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. PEP, or post-exposure prophylaxis, is used when a person thinks he or she may have come in contact with HIV during sex or shared needles.In addition to speaking to students on Seventh Street, the organization puts on workshops to educate students.“We’re just trying to kind of invite students into the conversation about HIV and sexual health in general because both of those ideas can be so stigmatized,” Jules Balibrera, SJSU to Zero health educator, said. “The idea of getting tested for STIs can be really scary. We do understand that and we want to work with that and work with that kind of vulnerability.” Balibrera said the organization is excited about changing the narrative around HIV through modern technology because it is different from what it was 30 years ago. SJSU to Zero believes it is important to inform students HIV is treatable and that people can live just as long of a life as those who don’t have it.The group focused its last workshop on stigma reduction. An example of this is the term “risky behavior” because it contains a negative connotation – but it doesn’t have to be if students are educated. Balibrera suggests that a health professional’s role in destigmatizing sexual health is to have open conversations with their patients about their sexual health.“Not put people in boxes, not make people uncomfortable, use inclusive language and also acknowledge that there’s a really complex social factor that determines how easy it is for someone to get sexual screening,” Balibrera said.Johal said more than 85 percent of students responded positively to SJSU to Zero when asked if they help get rid of the stigma surrounding HIV.“Just us being comfortable talking about sexual health makes other people feel a little more comfortable too,” Johal said. “I think creating that environment that’s safe to speak about things is really important.”There is no cure for HIV, but Johal said if you get treated early you can suppress the levels of the virus to the point where it’s undetectable and greatly reduces the risk of transmission. BY LOVETTA JACKSONSTAFF WRITERFollow Savannah on Twitter@harding_savthose who participated in the event. In a press release sent out earlier this week by USAS, students are demanding higher wages and more transparency between students and Faas. On April 27, the press release included a demand for a “living wage of $21.75 an hour.” According to the City of San Jose’s website, the current livable wage for a job without health benefits in the city is $21.82. USAS member Dalia Angel said Faas denied all of their demands when they met with him on Monday.Another press statement was sent out to media on Tuesday. The press release changed the rate to $15 an hour. In that press release, the organization also demanded, “guarantee full-time employees, keep all of the benefits provided by Spartan Shops during [a] 12-month period.”“We want [Faas] to formally write down that these students will get their jobs back,” Angel said. “We want to insure that students will get their jobs back without having to reapply. He also blames students for this transition for the food court services. He says people graduate, they’re unreliable, they’re late, they don’t show up.”According to USAS’ press release, Aramark and Chartwells were named as the two companies that are competing to take over Spartan Shops sometime in May. However, no company has been officially named by the university and Faas previously said the decision will officially be made early May.“We want something transparent,” sociology senior Briannah Drew said. “We want inclusion. We need Spartan Shops workers to be involved in every meeting with the subcontractor.” For now, USAS and Spartan Shops workers are collecting signatures to petition a third-party company and to ask for an agreement to their demands.LABORContinued from page 1Follow Lovetta on Twitter@LovettaajacksonEvent teaches students about menstrual cupsBY LOVETTA JACKSONSTAFF WRITERThere Will Be Blood, an event hosted by the Gender Equity Center, discussed menstruation, stigma and reusable menstrual products in the Student Union on Tuesday.The event was hosted by Gender Equity intern Kristen Flaten.“It’s like this big taboo and it feels like we can’t talk about it,” Flaten said. “Even though it affects at least half of the population here.”Reusable menstrual products sparked her interest in creating this event. The reusable products are used internationally to stop the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), Flaten said.TSS is a rare but life-threatening infection caused by an overgrowth of bacteria if a tampon is left in for too long.“I think everyone deserves access to the information and also the resources to get the menstrual products that they prefer,” Flaten said. The menstrual cup was the highlight of the event as students asked more questions about the product.The menstrual cup is a silicone, bell-shaped feminine hygiene product placed into the vagina during menstruation. It holds about twice as much blood compared to tampons, reduces risk of TSS, prevents rashes and has a 10-year lifespan, Flaten said.“If the first one doesn’t work for you, you might end up having to go through a few,” chemistry junior Charlotte Theriault said. “I know the cost at first seems daunting, but you really do have to think of it in the grand scheme of things where are you going to want to pay for tampon after tampon or do you want to pay for just one thing.”Theriault’s experience began with using a beginner cup, which is smaller than other menstrual cups. Theriault started wearing pads and tampons when she first started her period, but said she has an autoimmune disorder that affects her vulva, which creates a lot of vaginal dryness called hyperkeratosis. She switched to the menstrual cup because there is not a lot of friction or irritation.“That’s part of breaking down the stigma is having casual conversations about it,” Flaten said. “It’s not a big deal. There are non-binary and trans folks that are affected by this too, and the stigma is even worst in their case.”Flaten presented many samples of the menstrual cup to show there are differences in size and other alternatives like a reusable pad.“I learned how cost effective pads are and that how I can maybe look into other options that won’t hinder me in the future,” political science sophomore La’Nisha Woods said.The menstrual cup lasts about 10 years and only needs to be purchased once compared to pads and tampons that can cost around $150 to $300 a year, according to USA Today.

Jules Balibrera SJSU to Zero educatorIf you’ve ever felt uncomfortable in a workout class before, try falling off a stationary bike and ripping your pants in front of everyone. The new comedy, “I Feel Pretty,” starring Amy Schumer, Michelle Williams and Rory Scovel hit theaters on April 20. If you’ve seen the 2001 film “Shallow Hal,” you may see some correlation between these two films. “I Feel Pretty” is about Renee Barrett, played by Schumer, and her sad, boring, mediocre life.Early on in the film we can tell Renee has major confidence issues as nobody really acknowledges her presence. As a young woman living in the hustle and bustle of New York City, she is constantly surrounded by beautiful people and often compares herself to them. Th e fi lm starts with Renee attending her fi rst SoulCycle class. Th e class is fi lled with skinny, fi t people which we can sense is very intimidating for Renee. After an embarrassing first workout, she spends time with her two girlfriends, played by Busy Philipps and Aidy Bryant. While working at her low-end job as a website manager for a cosmetic company, Renee realizes she’s sick of people dismissing her because of her appearance. At the next SoulCycle class, she seems a little more confident and ready for a challenge. During her excitement, Renee loses control, falls off her bike and hits her head. As she regains consciousness, she now sees herself as the beautiful woman she has always wanted to be. She’s thin, smart, sexy and has all the confidence in the world. Its a little too much confidence, like standing in front of her bedroom window naked, but that’s what made this film hilarious. Th rough her newfound confi dence we can predict exactly what’s going to happen next. She meets the perfect guy, lands her dream job and is now noticed by those around her.Some of these changes improve her life, however she starts to get wrapped up in the beauty of things and people start to hate the person she’s becoming. She is overly confi dent, only cares about her looks and ditches her old friends for new, better looking ones.The film is filled with hilarious light hearted comedy. It’s comedy anybody can relate to because we all know how it feels to be compared to others, struggle with our confidence and the desire to fit in to society’s standards.Th e movie sends a great message to the audience. It shows viewers that you’re beautiful just the way you are and how you choose to view yourself is how others will see you.sjsunews.com/spartan_daily WEDNESDAY, MAY 2, 2018ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT 3EVENT RECAPMOVIE REVIEWBY JASMINE STRACHANSTAFF WRITERBY AMANDA WHITAKERSTAFF WRITERFollow Amanda on Twitter@AmandaWhitDailyFollow Jasmine on Twitter@jaasssyjayMACLA engages local community with art JASMINE STRACHAN | SPARTAN DAILYTaller Girasol Arte founder Lisa Castellanos helps children make silk prints of the Rini Templeton art piece, “Los Ninos Son Las Semillas Del Cambio,” which means “The Children are the Seeds of Change,” on Saturday.Schumer’s new  movie sends positive message to audiencesTh e sounds of children laughing and playing consumed the air as traditional Latin music shot blaring vibrations through everyone’s body. With the sun glistening, Movimiento de Arte y Cultura Latino Americana (MACLA) held its annual Family Art Day on Saturday.There were parents and children from all different cultures and ethnic backgrounds in attendance.MACLA is an inclusive contemporary experience that incorporates visual, literary and performing arts as a means to keep the community engaged in civic dialogue and transformation, according to its website.Many San Jose residents brought their children for a day of fun fi lled with several entertaining performances, diff erent art activities and other organizations. San Jose resident Daniel Lopez brought his four children to MACLA’s event to expose them to different cultures.“I think music is universal and for them, listening to diff erent cultures helps,” Lopez said. Lopez and his family are Mexican-American but Lopez said his children enjoy all types of music from Brazilian to hip-hop.“We came last year for the same specific reason because they had different dances and music,” Lopez said. Th e entertainment kept the audience moving with diff erent sounds from across the globe. Th e Brazilian percussionist band, Bloco Do Sol mixed several rhythmic beats that created the perfect sound.The consistent drum beats pulsated waves throughout your entire body.Mini Mix’D, an Oakland-based, all-girl youth hip-hop dance troupe, performed and taught the crowd how to shake their bodies to sounds of Cardi B, Bruno Mars, and Mary J. Blige.The young performers from Grupo Folklorico Los Laureles, a San Jose-based dance group, shocked the audience when they emerged in their brightly colored dresses and danced to traditional Mexican folk music.The crowded art tables of silk screen printing, personalized stamp-making and a bubble station were definite highlights for the kids. Lisa Castellanos led the silk-screen printing activity. She taught them what it means to hold a squeegee and recognize gradient colors.Castellanos is the founder and lead artist of Taller Girasol Arte, a project at the school of Arts and Culture in the Mexican Heritage Plaza.“The message is putting a lot of faith into our youth so they see themselves that way,” Castellanos said. “I’m featuring the art of Rini Templeton who is one of my heroes in terms of social justice, art and graphics.”Lucille “Rini” Corinne Templeton, who passed away in 1986, was a prominently known graphic artist and political activist in the United States, Mexico and Central America.Templeton kept all her work copyright free so the community could always use it for social justice purposes, which is why Castellanos used her piece at Family Art Day. Castellanos helped kids with a silk-print of the saying “Los Ninos Son Las Semillas Del Cambio,” which translates to “The Children are the Seeds of Change.”Sharon Benítez, performing arts engagement coordinator at MACLA, said she remembers growing up in downtown San Jose and her mother would bring her and her sister to similar community events.“She would take us to events that were free,” Benítez said. “Th at were outdoors. Th at involved the community. Th at were all kinds of cultures altogether. It was just a mix of everything and now I am so happy that I am being able to create those similar programs for the next generations.”MACLA works to benefi t the San Jose community through art with free aft er school programs for ages 13 to 19. There is a digital media and culture studio for young adults. It offers classes in digital photography, videography, music production and competitive slam poetry team.INTHEATERS“I Feel Pretty”Directed by: Abby KohnStarring:  Amy Schumer,  Michelle Williams,Rory ScovelGenre: ComedyRating: \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002ARTS & ENTERTAINMENTsjsunews.com/spartan_daily WEDNESDAY, MAY 2, 20184PLAY REVIEWGAME REVIEWBY WILLIAM YAPNEWS EDITORBY CHIOMA LEWISSTAFF WRITERFollow Chioma on Twitter@clevermindlewisFollow William on Twitter@TheDapperYap‘In the Heights’ nearly hits the jackpotPHOTO COURTESY OF JACK ZHENNina Rosario (Ally Abonador) sings about leaving the neighborhood during the song, “It Won’t Be Long Now” in Act 1 of “In the Heights” Male characters dance around Nina when she mentions the men who pursue her.Harry Potter game displays the virtual wizarding worldDOWNLOADNOW“Harry Potter: A Hogwarts Mystery”Studio:Jam City Inc.Genre: AdventureMSRP: FreeRating: \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002ONGOINGEVENT“In The Heights”Directed by: Buddy ButlerVenue: Hammer TheatreRating: \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002“Harry Potter: A Hogwarts Mystery” brings the famous wizarding world to players’ mobile devices. On April 25, Jam City and Portkey Games released the game for iOS and Android devices.“A Hogwarts Mystery” provides a mobile experience that allows players to be part of the wizarding world and create their own story through their choices and adventures. People who have been dreaming of going to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft  and Wizardry can now experience it as a student through all seven years. Players can customize their characters appearance from skin color to facial features.Th e ability to create a character that looks like you and has your name makes you actually feel as if you are a part of the wizarding world. Once you’ve created your character, you follow a storyline as a Hogwarts student and your story will depend on the diff erent choices throughout the game. Hogwarts academy has various quests and activities that determine the character’s progress through the game. Th e game takes place in 1984, long before Harry Potter is old enough to attend Hogwarts or defeat Voldemort. Th e wizarding world exists as it did before the Battle of Hogwarts and the death of Albus Dumbledore. Th e fact that the game takes place when characters such as Dumbledore are still alive, makes the playing experience even more rewarding. After visiting Diagon Alley, The Hogwarts Express takes the students to Hogwarts, where they are greeted by Professor McGonagall to be taken to the sorting ceremony. Just as it is in the books, the Sorting Hat takes into account what house the student wants. Th e hat asks the player which house he or she was  hoping to be placed in: Gryffi  ndor, Ravenclaw, Huffl  epuff  or Slytherin. When the player makes his or her choice, the sorting hat places them in that chosen house. Choosing a Hogwarts house is one of the most exciting parts of the game because it is a huge part of your characters’ identity. Peeves the Poltergeist, who is a popular trouble-making character in the book series, can be seen fl ying around the halls taunting and laughing. Th e addition of Peeves to the game is relieving for fans who missed his presence in the movie series. In the fi rst year, players attend classes where they learn to fl y brooms and cast spells. Th e player will take potions classes from Professor Snape, transfi guration with Professor McGonagall and charms from Professor Flitwick.Th e interactive classes allow you to experience Hogwarts as seen in the fi lms and read in the books. Creating potions and being insulted and criticized by Snape makes you feel like a real student. Your character can create friendships or relationships with other students. Th e strength of the friendships depend on how many friendship quests are completed. Players will experience the excitement of Hogwarts as they play and progress on to other years.Th e game is available in the Google Play Store and the App Store. Lights up on a low-income street on Washington Heights, a neighborhood in the New York City borough Manhattan. Usnavi (Oklys Pimentel), the owner of a bodega, opens the show with an energetic song that excitedly introduces the major players of the musical “In the Heights.”Th e show, created by Tony Award winner Lin-Manuel Miranda, fuses musical genres such as hip-hop and Latin music to bring forward songs not oft en seen on Broadway. Th e choreography in the show compliments the music in a sense a younger generation will fi nd exciting to watch.“In the Heights” is a musical I highly recommend people should see at least once in their lives. Th e Tony Award-winning musical off ers a story of immigrants dreaming for a better life the San Jose State community would surely enjoy.The cast and crew of this show do a good job of presenting it as a great experience. However, some directorial choices and a couple of blunders prevent the show from being perfect.As the owner of the neighborhood’s bodega, a small grocery store commonly seen in Hispanic neighborhoods, Usnavi constantly supplies the community with their fi x of café con leche (coff ee with milk) and lottery tickets.Pimentel as Usnavi did a wonderful job bringing the essence of the character while showcasing his range in rapping, singing and acting.He works at the bodega alongside his younger cousin Sonny (Jordan Celestino), a teenager with progressive views and a chip on his shoulder. Celestino won me over with his performance by the end of the musical, but there were moments he screamed more than he sang.Nina (Ally Abonador) returns home for the summer aft er spending one year at Stanford. However, Nina struggles to tell the neighborhood she failed her classes.Vanessa (Cristina Hernandez) is tired of living in the bodega and dreams of moving out of the low-income neighborhood.Abuela Claudia (Marsha Dimalanta) serves as the matriarchal fi gure of the neighborhood because she has lived there for so long.Most of the cast did an amazing job with their vocals. Th e women in the show captivated me with their performances. Daniella (Rochelle Cartagena Segura) was an instant favorite for me and I loved the attitude Segura brought to the character.Unfortunately, some moments during the show were undermined by inconsistencies with audio mixing. Some actors had diffi  culty projecting their voices for the back row to hear and there was a big contrast in levels when the microphones turned on for musical numbers.Benny (Jonah Price) dreams of opening his own business and works for Nina’s father Kevin (Jese Guzman). He quickly pines for Nina’s aff ection while attempting to win the approval of her family. Price did a great job vocally, but I felt his approach to the character felt more whiny and undeserved.Guzman knocked it out of the park vocally, but lacked believable acting. Th ere were times I felt he overreacted to his surroundings and his performance didn’t feel grounded or real.Out of all the ensemble members, fi ve of them stood out specifi cally for their dancing abilities. Th eir sharp moves were exciting to watch when they had the spotlight. However, I noticed times cast members had to restrict their movements because space was small.Th e Hammer Th eatre boasts it uses original set pieces from its time on Broadway, but, it did not work well with the limited space and felt more congested than it should. Th e characters in the show are layered with depth and it was satisfying to watch their stories play out. Th e story is about people with dreams and it is compelling to watch because many people can relate to the themes presented in the musical.“In the Heights” at the Hammer Th eatre has six more performances left . However, there are no tickets available, according to the website. Despite some blunders, the show has every right to be sold out. A musical about the American dream will be a favorite for years.is blood in dairy milk, according to the Global Healing Center.“Sure, various milk products across the world are used from goat to yak milk, but as a developed society, we do not need it. It’s unnecessary to our health and it hurts us,” De La Fuente said.According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, approximately 65 percent of the human population has a decline in the ability to digest lactose, the main sugar found in milk, after infancy. Because of the high percentage of lactose intolerance, it doesn’t seem like milk is a natural drink for humans to consume.Recombinant bovine g r o w t h hormones (rBGH) are hormones injected into cows in the U.S. to increase milk-production according to the Institute For Responsible Technology. These cows have a higher level of IGF-1, a hormone considered to be a high risk factor for breast, prostate, colon, lung and other cancers.P r e - m e n o p a u s a l women under 50 have a higher risk of developing breast cancer while men are four times more likely to developbreast cancer.“I do believe that there are certain benefits to drinking cow milk,” mechanical engineering junior Nishan Natt said. “It is a good source of calcium and protein, but you can easily replace milk with other things in your diet to get what need from it. I would advise people to stop drinking milk, as there really is no biological need to drink it past your early childhood. No other animal on the planet drinks milk past early childhood, much less the milk ofanother animal.” Milk from rBGH-treated cows with its rise in IGF-1 levels also increases the rate of fraternal twin births in humans. In the United States, the number of fraternal twins grew at twice the rate as that in the United Kingdom, where rBGH is banned according to Institute For Responsible Technology.“It has many nutrients, hormones, and important things for infant calves,” mechanical engineering sophomore Graham Giese said. “This is not a natural food for adult humans, it does not contribute to a healthy adult diet. I recommend that people stop drinking cows milk.”People should look into healthier and cleaner alternatives to dairy milk. There are options like almond, soy, rice and coconut milk. Neither of these contain blood or pus. There are pros and cons to all milk alternatives but it depends on an individual’s diet.sjsunews.com/spartan_daily WEDNESDAY, MAY 2, 2018OPINION 5Lovetta JacksonSTAFF WRITERAnimal milk is not healthy or made for humansHumans are the only species that consume another animal’s milk.As a child, I was always told that milk would help me grow strong bones and help my teeth.It wasn’t until my senior year of high school I started to drink almond milk. I got a stomachache aft er drinking cow’s milk, and I couldn’t fi gure out why.I believed I was lactose intolerant, and it led me to research milk.After my research, I have come to the conclusion that non-human milk shouldn’t be consumedby humans.According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), one in six dairy cows suffer from mastitis, which is also responsible for one in six deathsof cows.Mastitis is the inflammatory reaction of a cow’s udder, which is where the milkis released.The effect of this disease leads to the high amount of somatic cells in dairy milk. Somatic cells are mostly white blood cells. When a cow is infected with mastitis, more than90 percent of the somatic cells in its milk are neutrophils, which are the inflammatory immune cells thatform pus.“There needs to be a lot of information out there, and we need to not care about the farmers and other people who support the milk industry,” English junior Marty De La Fuente said.“It is an industry so they are going to fight the change but as a people it needs to change. Now, I do not say to ban it either. Just more information needs to get out there. Keep it around as new products are made. I hated almond milk the first time I tried it but now I love it. I have seven kids total and none of them as they grew up had milk. It’s justnot needed,” De La Fuente said.The USDA allows up to 1.5 million white blood cells per milliliter of commonly-sold milk. This means there Follow Lovetta on Twitter@LovettaajacksonLove is something that cannot be measured and isn’t tangible. It’s a powerful emotion that impacts our daily lives whether you’re spreading, accepting or looking for love.Growing up in a close household, the phrase “I love you” was said constantly. Every family phone call concludes with saying “I love you.” I hear those three words every day and I’m grateful for it.“I love you is just a three word sentence, but the value it holds, the message that it passes on can turn the tides,” Onlymyhealth writer Namrata Rutta said. “These three words have the power to make bonds strongerthan ever.”I understand some families have love for each other but don’t say the actual words “I love you” all that often. I think those words are important to hear, especially from family, because they bring a sense of acceptance and boost one’s self-esteem.A c k n o w l e d g i n g love for someone isn’t always the easiest thing to do, but it is not healthy to suppress such emotions. O p e n c o m m u n i c a t i o n about love for a family member or a significant other releases the pressure from keeping those emotions inside, and it feels good tobe loved.It’s important to say “I love you” because people can’t read your mind. Expressing feelings can be difficult, but I haven’t met a single person who doesn’t enjoy hearing he or she is loved. Getting it all out in the open can be a relief and you don’t want to wait too long, because you may regret not letting a loved one know how much you care about them by failing to say those threepowerful words.Even when you know someone loves you, it’s still nice to have someone care enough to say it aloud. Some say actions speak louder than words and in a way that’s true. How you treat someone is an indicator of how you feel toward them, but saying “I love you” confirms what your actions have implied all along.It’s imperative to say “I love you” to loved ones because it lets them know you’re willing to make sacrifi ces and put their needs ahead of your own.In some families, love is rarely verbally expressed and that’s not to say they don’t love each other as much as families who say it all the time. I can’t think of a better family environment than one where being loved and feeling loved is the basis for everything done within the family.Some people fi nd it necessary to keep their guard up and refrain from showing emotion. Th e decision to consciously omit emotion portrays a sense of personal dishonesty and is unfair to the loved ones who simply want to hear they are indeed loved.Expressing love openly, whether it’s toward a family member or life partner, naturally strengthens that bond. The world can leave traumatic emotional scars on a person and it can make people reluctant to say “I love you.” It’s that fear of being exposed and vulnerable that prevents someone from releasing his or her inhibitions and being their true self.Saying ‘I love you’ is importantJoe RoiasSTAFF WRITERFollow Joe on Twitter@joe_roiasILLUSTRATION BY MARCI SUELA | SPARTAN DAILYPeople should look into healthier and cleaner alternatives to dairy milk.OPINIONsjsunews.com/spartan_daily WEDNESDAY, MAY 2, 20186For female rap artists, it’s more about putting the two against each other instead of focusing on the content they release.Women are known as emotional creatures. Their methods of expressing strong emotions are higher than men’s. According to an article published in the Public Library of Science, women experience higher emotional expressivity, especially for negative emotions, while men go through more intense emotional experiences. Even so, both men and women share some type of emotional response when experiencing high-pressure situations, yet women are ridiculed for it.They’re either too catty or bitchy because they are sharing their raw emotions about the issue at hand. With women, there is an immediate association with drama and cattiness behind the simple fact that they are women.Nicki Minaj and Cardi B are two top contenders in the female rap game to date. Both artists recently dropped material. Cardi B is still a new, emerging artist who dropped her first album titled “Invasion of Privacy.” Nicki Minaj, a veteran in the female hip-hop game, recently dropped two new singles, “Barbie Tingz” and “Chun-Li,” shortly after Cardi B. Immediately, the two were pitted against each other even though there were no direct shots taken at the other in their music. People have a tendency to add to unnecessary narratives because drama with women is entertaining. The idea is to compete, however, it is not to discredit their craft for entertainment. It is already difficult to gain respect in a male-dominated industry, but in addition, female artists are forced to fight against women stereotypes. It’s true – rap beefs are inevitable. These disputes contribute to the expansion ofthe culture. It’s invigorating and exciting to hear your favorite artists’ lyrics, especially when they are taking shots at someone else. We should allow female artists the luxury to do their jobs freely without implications of pettiness attached. Female rap artists deserve credit for their craftThere is nothing wrong with a little friendly competition. In hip-hop, competition is a catalyst to push the culture forward because the idea is to be the greatest artist above anyone else. Rap beefs are a cornerstone of the culture. They drivethe culture. Rap beefs make things more interesting because fans are watching their favorite artists beautifully and lyrically beat their competition. It’s like basketball. It’s seeing your favorite team win a game against its rivals. That is the level of excitement rap offers artists and fans, but when it comes to female artists, these quarrels are not often viewed through lenses of art and eagernessto compete. Words like “petty” or “catty” are used to describe the rap beefs female artists encounter, which quickly diminishes their recognition. Rap beefs between male artists are embraced with honor and ambition. In 2015, Drake and Meek Mill had social media in a frenzy because of their rap beef. The battle took the hip-hop culture by storm for its candidness. According to Billboard, Meek Mill accused Drake of not writing his own raps. He went as far as outing Drake’s supposed ghostwriter,Quentin Miller.In response, Drake dropped “Charged Up” in summer 2015. Meek Mill called the track out on Twitter, saying it was “baby lotion soft.” Drake came back with “Back to Back,” which became one of the greatest diss tracks rap had seen in a long time. Their beef was dubbed “summer’s best beef,” according toThe Verge. This is not the same energy given to female rap artists. I think people love to capitalize on drama between women which explains why female rap beefs are often discredited.

Most of the time, the sports agencies will target high-profi le players that are about to begin their college careers and are seen as probablepro athletes. Th e sports agencies feel if an athlete accepts money, then it has an under-the-table commitment from the athlete to become a client of the agency once he or she declares for the professional draft .If a college athlete is found accepting illegal benefi ts such as a large sum of money, receiving more than the allotted number of complimentary admissions, selling c o m p l i m e n t a r y admissions at any price such as his or her game-worn jerseys or receiving material benefi ts that are not available to the general student body; then that collegiate athlete may lose his or her eligibility, scholarship and right to play collegiate sports, according to the NCAA rules handbook.Nowhere in that book does it say the university, for which the collegiate athlete is playing, is subject to take the fall or be penalized for the athlete’s mistakes.Th e athlete should be the one that gets hit with all the severe penalties that are a result of his or her mistake as it says in the rules handbook.Two well-documented cases where the university was penalized for the mistakes of its college athlete happened to the basketball and football programs of the Gabriel MungaraySTAFF WRITERsame school.Th e University of Southern California faced two scandals on two of its high-profi le recruits accepting improper benefi ts from sports agencies while being recruited. Th ese two athletes were now-retired running back Reggie Bush and former NBA player O.J. Mayo.According to an article written by Nakia Hogan on Th e Times Picayune, from October 2004 to October 2005, Bush, his mother and his stepfather agreed to form a sports agency with two additional partners. Aft er the agency was formed, Bush and his family members requested they get fi nancial assistance from the agency that included living rent-free in a home in San Diego. Bush also accepted cash and gift s from the sports agency.According to the Los Angeles Times, Mayo received improper benefi ts in the form of cash, clothes and a fl at-screen TV from former events promoter Rodney Guillory, who had received more than $200,000 from a Northern California sportsmanagement agency.Mayo accepted these improper benefi ts in his one year of playing basketball for USC in the 2007-2008 season.As a result of these two scandals, the USC athletic department was put on probation for four years. Th e football program was put on a two-year postseason ban, had a loss of 30 scholarships over the 2011-2013 seasons and then vacated all football victories starting in December 2004 and through the 2005 season, according to Th e Times Picayune.Th e USC basketball program was given a one-year post-season ban, self-imposed penalties, forfeiture of its wins from the 2007-2008 season, a fi ne of $5,000 and forfeited the $206,200 that were earned at the 2008 NCAA tournament.The university should never take the blame, let alone suffer the penalties of a major mistake made by one of its collegiate athletes.Follow Gabriel on Twitter@SJSneakerheadSOURCE:  NCAA, SB NATION AND LOS ANGELES TIMES, INFOGRAPHIC BY GABRIEL MUNGARAY | SPARTAN DAILYAccording to the NCAA, a collegiate athlete may lose his or her eligibility, scholarship and right to play collegiate sports if he or she is found accepting illegal benefi ts, such as accepting a large sum of money or receiving material benefi ts not available to the general student body. Cases involving Reggie Bush and O.J. Mayo are just two examples of misconduct committed at the collegiate level. The University of Southern California football program received penalties from the NCAA for its former running back Reggie Bush accepting a house, a car and money during his college career. The university’s football program received a postseason ban, loss of scholarships and forfeited wins from 2004-2005.The University of Southern California basketball program withdrew from postseason consideration, vacated wins from the 2007-2008 season and received two fi nes by the NCAA after an investigation found former guard O.J. Mayo received cash, clothes and a fl at-screen TV from an events promoter during that season. O.J. MAYOREGGIE BUSHSPORTSsjsunews.com/spartan_daily WEDNESDAY, MAY 2, 20188May 7Williams provides leadership for his teamSan Jose State senior outfielder Chris Williams has been a force to be reckoned with this season for the Spartans.Williams is hitting .299 and is tied for second on the team in RBIs with 28. Williams played his first year at SJSU during the 2015 season before transferring to San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton, California for the 2016 season and then returning to SJSU  in 2017.Not only does Williams bring both his batting and fielding talents to each game, he also brings along senior leadership.“His smile is infectious, his attitude on the way he approaches a game and his attitude in the dugout just relaxes everybody and allows the team to play loose,” interim head coach Brad Sanfilippo said. “You need a guy that’s able to laugh and lighten the mood and certainly does that all of the time. Our younger guys can look to him because he’s a senior and he’s been here and he’s been through everything so I think it brings a confidence to us,” Sanfilippo added.Williams has also brought the best out of his teammates since playing on the team.“He brings confidence, he brings experience to the younger guys to look up [to],” senior infielder David Campbell said. “I’ve been playing with him for the last three years and he’s just given me that confidence and relaxed feeling being able to go out and know he’s going to be there to do what he needs to do and he’s going to take off the relief for everybody else too.” Growing up, Williams chose to play a sport that was not common in his household.“My whole family is football orientated, so I was kind of the odd one out playing baseball,” Williams said. “My brother went to UNLV for football and I was better in baseball. I had more of a shot college wise in baseball. Didn’t really have the height to play QB so baseball was the sport for me.”Outside of playing baseball at SJSU, catching up on his favorite shows and movies on Netflix is Williams’ preference.“I would say I am a huge Netflix watcher, catching up on episodes and everything like that,” Williams said.“The whole team is around ‘Fortnite,’ but I’m not really a ‘Fortnite’ guy, I’m not too good at it, so watching Netflix is probably what I’m good at.” Williams’ teammates say he is just as great of a guy on the field as he is off the field.“He’s a really relaxed, easygoing and fun guy,” Campbell said. “I love to be around him.” Campbell reminisced about the times  he  played with Williams.“Chris and I have so many different memories,” Campbell said. “We have a bunch of inside jokes and that would be the biggest thing, depending on the situation we can just look at each other and know exactly what the other person is thinking and I think that’s definitely one thing I would takeaway from Chris is all the inside jokes we have.” Senior infielder Kyle Morrison shared Williams’ growth as a player as his favorite memory.“I played with Chris my freshman year when he was here and then as you know he left to go play at Delta and then came back,” Morrison said. “Just seeing when he came back, his transformation was like unbelievable and he was a completely different person, a completely different player, so I think that was the most special part when he came back and was so much better and that was pretty exciting to see.” Williams’ biggest source of motivation in his life growing up came from his family.“My mom is a huge inspiration,” Williams said. “That’s a tough lady. Been through a lot and she’s always had my back and number one fan through everything and couldn’t really do it without her. My brother kind of pushed me to be better and I was trying to be better than him and that kind of helped me along the way because family competition never hurt nobody.”BY GABRIEL MUNGARAYSTAFF WRITERFollow Gabriel on Twitter@SJSneakerheadHe brings confi dence, he brings experience to the younger guys to look up [to].David Campbell Spartan infi elder“BASEBALLGABRIEL MUNGARAY | SPARTAN DAILY (FILE IMAGE)SJSU senior outfi elder Chris Williams bats against Northern Colorado at Municipal Stadium on Feb.18.Eight SJSU Spartans sign contracts with NFL teamsEight San Jose State football players signed contracts with the National Football League this offseason.Spartan cornerback Jermaine Kelly was drafted by the Houston Texans in the seventh round of the 2018 NFL draft.The 6-foot-1-inch, 195-pound Los Angeles native became the third SJSU player to be drafted by the Texans in the last six seasons. He completed three seasons with the Spartans af ter  t ransferr ing from the University of Washington and was third in the Mountain West Conference for most pass breakups last season. Kelly sat out the 2015 season per the NCAA transfer rules and regulations. Overall, he played in 25 games and started 17 times for SJSU in the 2016 and 2017 seasons. His one interception with SJSU was a 68-yard return for a touchdown against Utah State in September.Fe l low Sp ar t an cornerback Andre Chachere signed a free agent contract with the Texans.Ac c o r d i n g  t o the Mountain West Conference Connection, Chachere was the only Spartan invited to the NFL combine in Indianapolis. There, Chachere was praised for his footwork, reactions and quickness. Signing with the NFL is a bonus for Chachere, who also welcomed a son during his NFL tryouts. “If I ever get tired or I can’t do any more reps, I’m like, ‘Oh man, I got to do it for my son’,” Chachere said to the Fresno Bee.Six fellow undrafted Spartan football players signed free agent contracts with other teams. Punter  Michae l Carrizosa went to the Cleveland Browns, linebacker Frank Ginda joined the Arizona Cardinals,  offensive lineman Chris Gonzalez went to the Minnesota Vikings, offensive lineman Jeremiah Kolone joined the Los Angeles Rams, safety Maurice McKnight went to the New York Jets and linebacker William Ossai joined the Indianapolis Colts.BY KRISTEL RODRIGUEZSTAFF WRITERFollow Kristel on Twitter@KO_352FOOTBALLIf I ever get tired or I can’t do any more reps, I’m like, ‘Oh man, I got to do it for my son.’Andre Chachere Cornerback“stay connectedFACEBOOK: spartandailyTWITTER: @spartandailyINSTAGRAM:@spartandailyYOUTUBE:spartandailyYT",
