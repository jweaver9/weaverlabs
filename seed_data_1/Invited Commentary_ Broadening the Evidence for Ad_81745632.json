This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nAbstract Scientific research has made major contribu-\ntions to adolescent health by providing insights into factors\nthat influence it and by defining ways to improve it.\nHowever, US adolescent sexual and reproductive health\npolicies—particularly sexuality health education policies\nand programs—have not benefited from the full scope of\nscientific understanding. From 1998 to 2009, federal\nfunding for sexuality education focused almost exclusively\non ineffective and scientifically inaccurate abstinence-\nonly-until-marriage (AOUM) programs. Since 2010, the\nlargest source of federal funding for sexual health educa-\ntion has been the ‘‘tier 1’’ funding of the Office of Ado-\nlescent Health’s Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative. To\nbe eligible for such funds, public and private entities must\nchoose from a list of 35 programs that have been desig-\nnated as ‘‘evidence-based’’ interventions (EBIs), deter-\nmined based on their effectiveness at preventing teen\npregnancies, reducing sexually transmitted infections, or\nreducing rates of sexual risk behaviors (i.e., sexual activity,\ncontraceptive use, or number of partners). Although the\ntransition from primarily AOUM to EBI is important pro-\ngress, this definition of evidence is narrow and ignores\nfactors known to play key roles in adolescent sexual and\nreproductive health. Important bodies of evidence are not\ntreated as part of the essential evidence base, including\nresearch on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and\nquestioning (LGBTQ) youth; gender; and economic\ninequalities and health. These bodies of evidence under-\nscore the need for sexual health education to approach\nadolescent sexuality holistically, to be inclusive of all\nyouth, and to address and mitigate the impact of structural\ninequities. We provide recommendations to improve US\nsexual health education and to strengthen the translation of\nscience into programs and policy.\nIntroduction\nScience is an essential foundation for adolescent sexual and\nreproductive health. Researchers, policy makers, advo-\ncates, and citizens accept science as a basis for policies and\nprograms related to adolescent sexual and reproductive\nhealth. Scientific methods are used to identify the magni-\ntude of adolescent health problems, contributing factors\nand health consequences, and to develop and evaluate\nhealth education and prevention programs. Scientific\nunderstanding of adolescent sexual and reproductive health\nencompasses general and discipline-specific scientific the-\nory, qualitative and quantitative data, and scientific find-\nings from diverse fields, including the medical, health,\nsocial, and behavioral sciences.\nAdolescent sexual and reproductive health policy in the\nUnited States has failed to benefit from the full scope of\nscience.

President Oba-\nma’s 2010 teen pregnancy prevention initiative requires\nfunded programs to be based in scientific evidence, but the\nimplementation of this initiative has led to a new problem:\n‘‘Evidence’’ is now narrowly defined to include only cer-\ntain kinds of scientific findings. Currently, this initiative is\nthe largest federal funding program addressing the sexual\nhealth needs of adolescents. The US Department of Health\nand Human Services has approved funding for 35 ‘‘evi-\ndence-based’’ programs selected on the basis of studies that\nhave shown their effectiveness at preventing teen preg-\nnancies, reducing sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or\nreducing rates of sexual risk behaviors (i.e., sexual activity,\ncontraceptive use, or number of partners). These ‘‘evi-\ndence-based-interventions’’ (EBIs) are modeled after clin-\nical trials and implemented with the intention to effect\ntargeted behavior change.\nWhile a clear advance over previous policy, current\nadolescent sexual and reproductive health policy and pro-\ngramming remain uninformed by the scientific base in\nprofound ways. First, federal policy continues to fund\nabstinence programs that remain at odds with scientific\nthinking about adolescent sexual health. Second, key\nbodies of science are not treated as part of the essential\nevidence base for policy and programming. The exclusive\nfocus on pregnancy and disease prevention in the definition\nof sexual health leaves out aspects of adolescent sexual\ndevelopment and health that researchers argue are critical,\nsuch as sexual orientation and gender beliefs. The focus on\nindividual-level proximate causes of pregnancy and dis-\nease, such as sexual activity and contraceptive use, largely\neclipses the systematic, society-level structural inequities\nthat shape adolescent sexual behavior and risk. Finally,\ndefining ‘‘evidence’’ as evaluations of program effective-\nness for changing specific individual behaviors excludes\nbroader evidence regarding psychological, cultural, and\neconomic factors known to shape adolescent sexual health.\nWe begin our critique by reviewing the sexual and\nreproductive health needs of adolescents, with attention to\nthe role of schools in promoting sexual health. We then\ndiscuss the emergence of evidence-based interventions as a\nguiding force in US adolescent sexual and reproductive\nhealth policies and programs. With this background, we\nexamine three bodies of science—lesbian, gay, bisexual,\ntransgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQ) youth and\nhealth; gender; and economic inequalities—identifying key\nfindings that should inform adolescent sexual health and\neducation programs. These bodies of evidence underscore\nthe need for sexual health education to approach adolescent\nsexuality holistically, to be inclusive of all youth, and to\naddress and mitigate the impact of structural inequities. In\nconclusion, we provide recommendations to improve\nadolescent sexuality education programs and policy, and\nthe link between research and policy.\nAdolescents and Their Sexual and Reproductive Health\nThe World Health Organization definition of health is ‘‘a\nstate of complete physical, mental, and social well-being\nand not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’’ (World\nHealth Organization 1946). Definitions of reproductive\nhealth and sexual health mirror and expand upon this\ndefinition of health. Central to our conception of adolescent\nsexual and reproductive health is an understanding of\nadolescence as a life stage defined by physiological, psy-\nchological, social, and cultural transitions marking the\nmovement from childhood to adulthood. Adolescents are\nemerging as adults, embodying a tension between the need\nfor protection and guidance by parents and adult caregiv-\ners, on one hand, and the rights to autonomy and agency on\nthe other.\nOver the past 60 years, important changes have occurred\nin the timing of adolescent transitions, including age at first\nsex, length of educational preparation, age at marriage and\ntiming of childbearing. In the United States, as in other\ndeveloped countries, adolescents typically initiate sexual\ncontact during their mid or late teens or early 20s (Finer\n2007; Halpern and Haydon 2012). The establishment of\nconstructive and satisfying romantic relationships is a key\ndevelopmental task of adolescence and an important con-\ntributor to sexuality and sexual health (Mayer et al. 2008).\nWe define sexuality to include the feelings, identities,\nrelationships, and interactions that form the foundations of\nsexual development, and a variety of non-coital and coital\nsexual experiences. Important aspects of adolescent sexual\ndevelopment include maintaining a positive body image,\ndeveloping self-efficacy in sexual decision-making and\ninteractions, and forming mutually respectful romantic\nrelationships (Schalet 2011a; Tolman 2002). Multiple and\nmulti-level factors influence personal attitudes, motiva-\ntions, and experiences, and can bolster or hinder the\ndevelopment of sexual self-efficacy, resiliency, healthy\nrelationships, and positive body image, as well as behav-\niors that promote and protect or threaten health. Bodies of\nknowledge related to inter-personal dynamics, school cli-\nmate, social norms, and cultural values and beliefs all\nprovide information about the motives for adolescent sex-\nual behavior (Russell 2005; Schalet 2011b). At the macro\nlevel, social and cultural forces including daily realities\nsuch as poverty or economic inequality, structural racism\nand stigmatization of youth who do not conform to rigid\ngender and sexual orientation norms, as well as medical\ntechnologies and access to health care and education, all\n1596 J Youth Adolescence (2014) 43:1595–1610\n123\nprofoundly shape adolescent health (Resnick et al. 2012).\nSocial and behavioral science research on adolescent health\nhas defined the important roles of families and peers,\nmedia, schools, life opportunities, demographic transitions,\nand cultural forces in shaping young people’s health status\n(Sawyer et al. 2012). Research in medicine and public\nhealth has documented the importance of health services,\nsexual health education, access to screening and treatment\nfor STIs, and public policies in improving health.\nAdolescent Sexual Health Challenges\nThe need for more broad and effective translation of sci-\nence into sexual and reproductive health policy is under-\nscored by the significant sexual health burdens among\nyouth. Comprising only 25 % of the sexually active pop-\nulation in the United States, young people (13–24 years)\naccount for approximately half of the 20 million STIs\ncontracted annually, including one in four of the estimated\n50,000 new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infec-\ntions diagnosed each year (CDC 2013a; Weinstock et al.\n2004). Racial, ethnic, and gender disparities are striking.\nThe majority of new adolescent cases (57 %) are among\nBlacks/African-Americans, with an additional 20 %\noccurring among Hispanics/Latinos (CDC 2012a, b).\nWomen accounted for one in four new HIV cases in 2009;\nthe incidence rate for Black/African American females\n(38.1/100,000) is 20 times the rate for White females (1.9)\n(CDC 2012b). However, men who have sex with men\n(MSM) are the population most affected by HIV in the\nUnited States; the estimated number of new HIV infections\namong adolescent and emerging adult Black/African\nAmerican MSM (aged 13–29 years) increased 48 % from\n2006 to 2009 (CDC 2011). Moreover, the US Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that nearly\n1.5 million high school students are affected by dating\nviolence annually, with rates of violence and sexual coer-\ncion especially high among LGBTQ youth and female\nadolescents (CDC 2006). Finally, despite historic declines\nin adolescent pregnancy and teen births, US teen birth rates\nremain the highest among the developed nations (National\nResearch Council 2013) even though levels of sexual\nexperience are similar. Within the United States, poor,\nrural and minority women have higher teen birth rates.\nThese disparities (by poverty and by race and ethnicity)\ndemonstrate the critical need for effective and medically\naccurate sexuality education, accessible adolescent health\ncare, and policy initiatives that reshape the educational and\nwork opportunities for disadvantaged youth.\nDespite the omnipresence of sexual messages in US\nmedia, frank public conversations about sexual and\nreproductive health, as holistically defined by organizations\nsuch as the World Health Organization, are rare.\nDiscomfort with adolescent sexuality runs throughout the\ndiverse institutions of American society, and it is perhaps\nno surprise that this discomfort has shaped our political\nconversations and policymaking. This discomfort and its\nimpact on policy are not, however, inevitable. Other\ndeveloped nations, such as the Netherlands and Denmark,\nhave shifted away from a historical discomfort with ado-\nlescent sexuality, fostering national dialogue and policies\naimed at supporting youth in their development—both\nsexual and socioeconomic—and seeing better overall\nadolescent sexual and reproductive health outcomes (Rose\n2005; Singh et al. 2001; Schalet 2011b). In the United\nStates, by contrast, multiple factors have contributed to\nongoing controversy around adolescent sexuality, includ-\ning its explicit politicization in recent decades, particularly\nwith regard to the teaching of sexual health education\nwithin schools (Irvine 2004; Luker 2007).\nAdolescent Sexual Health Education\nSchools have an essential role in promoting adolescent\nsexual and reproductive health, and science is essential in\nguiding the development of school health policies. As of\nfall 2013, about 50.1 million children and young people\nwere enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools\nacross the United States (National Center for Education\nStatistics 2013). Schools offer a practical and efficient\nmeans to reach young people with health information and\nhealth services. Because they include students across the\nsocioeconomic spectrum, public schools can educate and\nserve children and youth who may not have access to\neducation and services elsewhere. Schools are also an\nopportunity to educate all young people about health and\nsexuality before they initiate health risk behaviors, and to\nprovide health services that prevent disease and promote\nhealth. Thus schools can help young people establish\nhealthy behaviors that endure into adulthood (CDC 2013b;\nKirby 2002). In addition to promoting healthy behaviors,\nschools are important venues for the development of norms\nand values and for fostering positive self-concept and\nagency around sex, sexuality, and relationships (Center for\nSchool, Health, and Education, 2011).\nEducators, psychologists, and sociologists have argued,\nmoreover, that sexual health education also has an impor-\ntant role to play in combating the health and social dis-\nparities that young people face. They note that structural\nracism, poverty, gender inequality, and the stigmatization\nof LGBTQ people all negatively impact health outcomes,\nincluding sexual health outcomes, and have argued that it is\nincumbent upon educators not to perpetuate inequalities\nwithin the classroom through explicit or implicit stereo-\ntyping (Fine and McClelland 2006). They point to prob-\nlems not only in formal curricula, but also in the informal\nJ Youth Adolescence (2014) 43:1595–1610 1597\n123\nor hidden curricula—the implicit messages embedded in\nsexual health education—through which educators may\ninadvertently promote class, gender, and race stereotypes\n(Fields 2008; Morris 2007). Sexual health education has\nthe potential to give young people the opportunity to crit-\nically examine the societal inequalities linked to gender,\nrace, sexuality, and poverty (Fields 2008; Fine and McC-\nlelland 2006). Thus, while sexual health education cannot\nremove the inequalities in society at large, it can aid stu-\ndents in acquiring the critical thinking skills that will allow\nthem to more effectively confront and challenge them.\nFrom ‘‘Ab-only’’ to ‘‘EBI-only’’: US Federal Sexual\nHealth Education Policy\nThe history of sexuality education in the United States\nreflects philosophical clashes and alternating domination of\ncompeting approaches stemming from those philosophical\ndifferences (Irvine 2004; Luker 2007; Moran 2002).\nOpponents of sexual health education have argued that\nteaching young people about sex encourages them to be\nsexually active, even though there is no evidence to support\nsuch claims; rather sexual health education helps some\nyoung people delay initiation of sex (Kirby et al. 2007a). In\nthe 1990s the CDC provided significant funds to promote\nHIV/AIDS prevention education, which greatly expanded\nyouth exposure to sexual health education but emphasized\nprevention of STIs and HIV. Beginning in 1998, federal\nfunding shifted increasingly to a narrow focus on absti-\nnence as the primary program and policy solution for ‘‘the\nproblem’’ of adolescent sexuality. AOUM programs reflect\nthe strong moral and religious beliefs of their authors. Key\namong those are the beliefs that sex outside of heterosexual\nmarriage is sinful and that teaching about the health ben-\nefits of condoms and contraception is morally wrong\nbecause it encourages premarital sex. These beliefs are a\ncritical feature of the ‘‘conceptual’’ basis for AOUM pol-\nicies (Santelli et al. 2006).\nFrom 1998 to 2009 the US government spent almost 2\nbillion dollars on assistance to states, community-based,\nand faith-based organizations for AOUM educational pro-\ngrams [Sexuality Information and Education Council of the\nUnited States (SIECUS 2014)]. Since 2009, US funding for\ndomestic and international AOUM programs has\ndecreased. However, federal and state-funded AOUM\nprograms remain widespread in many parts of the United\nStates, despite multiple scientific and human right concerns\nthat have been raised by mainstream medical and public\nhealth organizations, including concerns about scientific\naccuracy, the withholding of life-saving information from\nyoung people, a lack of program efficacy, promotion of\ngender and racial stereotypes, insensitivity to non-\nheterosexual youth, and harm to traditional sexual health\neducation (American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on\nPsychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health and\nCommittee on Adolescence 2001; American Civil Liberties\nUnion 2008; American Public Health Association 2006;\nSantelli et al. 2006).\nRigorous evaluations of AOUM or abstinence-based\ncurricula have failed to demonstrate efficacy in delaying\ninitiation of sexual intercourse, reducing number of part-\nners, increasing condom use, or promoting secondary\nabstinence (i.e., cessation of sexual intercourse among\nsexually experienced youth) (Kirby 2008; Trenholm et al.\n2008). In contrast to abstinence approaches, a 2012 CDC\nmeta-analysis of 66 comprehensive risk reduction pro-\ngrams for youth showed favorable effects on current sexual\nactivity, frequency of sexual activity, number of sex part-\nners, frequency of unprotected sexual activity, use of pro-\ntection (either condoms and/or hormonal contraception),\npregnancy, and STIs (Chin et al. 2012). In the same report,\nthe CDC found insufficient scientific evidence for change\nin behaviors or other outcomes from abstinence education\nprograms (Chin et al. 2012).\nSince 2010, there has been a shift in federal approaches\nto sexual health education away from AOUM programs,\nand towards ‘‘evidence-based interventions’’ (EBI), led by\nthe US federal Office of Adolescent Health (OAH)\n(AOUM programs have still received substantial funding\nthrough the Title V State Abstinence Education Grant\nProgram). EBIs are treatments or interventions designed to\neffect behavior change that have been evaluated using\nrandomized or quasi-experimental designs.1 US Federal\nhealth policy has increasingly relied on these EBIs (CDC\n2013c; Evidence Based Intervention Network 2011). The\nauthorizing language for the Office of Adolescent Health\nspecifically describes ‘‘replication’’ of evidence-based\napproaches to teen pregnancy prevention programs and\nrequires medical accuracy in all funded programs. In\npractice this means that to be eligible for the largest\nfunding stream (termed ‘‘Tier 1’’), grantees must select\nfrom and replicate with fidelity the now 35 programs that\nhave been designated as EBIs.2 (A second group of funded\nprograms, Tier 2, develops and tests new approaches to\nprevent teen pregnancy, including emphasis on under-\nserved populations.)\n1 Such research designs are particularly useful in evaluating behav-\nioral interventions where effect sizes are small or where the efficacy\nof an intervention is unknown.\n2 The Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) of the US\nOffice of the Administration for Children and Families is a distinct\nfunding stream for teen pregnancy prevention; it does not require use\nof an EBI, however grantees are highly encouraged to use programs\non the EBI list.\n1598 J Youth Adolescence (2014) 43:1595–1610\n123\nCurrent emphasis on EBIs has been an important sci-\nentific and translational advance over prior federal efforts;\nhowever, a number of limitations have become evident\nwith this approach. Current policy has focused on repli-\ncation of specific curricula rather than the theory derived\nfrom research on EBIs, which provides a guide for\nunderstanding efficacy and adapting programs to new cir-\ncumstances (Kirby et al. 2007b; UNESCO 2009). Further,\nthe definitions of the health problems to be addressed and\nthe types of evidence brought to bear on those problems\nomit central bodies of research. A narrow focus on disease\nand pregnancy prevention—and on the individual-level\nbehavioral antecedents—undermines a more holistic\napproach to adolescent sexual health, and also ignores\ndecades of scientific evidence of the ways that structural\ninequities shape adolescent sexual behavior and risk\n(Anderson et al. 2005). By defining the ‘‘evidence base’’ as\nevaluation research about program success in effecting\nspecific (often small) behavior changes, the broader sci-\nentific record about factors known to shape adolescent\nsexual health outcomes has been relegated to a discre-\ntionary rather than central position. Grantees may use the\nbreadth of scientific thinking to design tier two programs\nbut they are not required—nor are those tasked with exact\nreplication able—to integrate it into their programming.\nThus, federal program requirements have had the unin-\ntended consequence of ignoring and marginalizing a\nbroader body of scientific principles and evidence regard-\ning adolescent sexual health and behavior.\nToward Holistic Adolescent Sexual Health\nWe have argued that Evidence Based Interventions often\ndo not reflect factors that the broad scientific literature\nidentifies as key to health behaviors and risks, and do not\napproach individual behavior in the broad context of ado-\nlescents’ lives. As such, there is a disconnect between\nresearch and theoretical advances on one hand, and sexual\nhealth education programs and policies on the other (Ro-\nmero et al. 2011). For instance, social and behavioral sci-\nence research documents the significance of the sexual\norientation of young people, the gender beliefs and ineq-\nuities that shape their sexual agency and relationships, and\nthe economic and racial inequalities that constrain their\noptions, as crucial to a holistic understanding of adolescent\nsexual health. But many EBIs do not fully address or even\nacknowledge the psychosocial and structural factors that\nshape the ways in which adolescents conduct their sexual\nlives. Thus, while consensus has emerged across disci-\nplines that gender, racism, stigmatization of LBGTQ youth,\nand poverty are critical to adolescent health, we lack pro-\ngrammatic emphasis and EBIs that address these\ninequalities. Moreover, when EBIs fail to address non-EBI\nscientific data about the role of poverty, race, and gender in\nadolescent sexual health they create the potential for\nreinforcing cultural stereotypes.\nIn the remainder of this article, we turn to evidence from\nacross the social and behavioral sciences that should be\ncentral to all adolescent sexual health education. We show\nhow the emerging research on LGBTQ youth calls for\ninclusiveness in adolescent sexual health education pro-\ngramming. Drawing from an extensive literature on the\nharmful effects of gender inequity and stereotypes, we\ndemonstrate the need for sexual health education to address\nthese issues. Finally, we illustrate how poverty and\ninequality intersect with adolescent sexual health education\nin a myriad of ways that have distinct implications for\npolicy and programming.\nLGBTQ Education and Health\nContemporary LGBTQ and gender nonconforming youth\n‘‘come out’’ or disclose their identities at younger ages than\nprior cohorts and have distinct sexual health needs (Floyd\nand Bakeman 2006). It is now commonly understood that\nLGBTQ students may face victimization at school, or\ngenerally hostile school climates (Birkett et al. 2009). Their\nneeds are often invisible in sexual and reproductive health\nservices, and they are typically excluded from sexual\nhealth education programs (Bay-Cheng 2003; Cianciotto\nand Cahill 2003; Sanchez 2012). Yet the known risks for\nLGBTQ youth are clear: greater rates of HIV for males and\ntransgender youth; higher rates of high-risk sexual behavior\nfor males, females, and transgender youth; and higher rates\nof pregnancy for both girls and boys (results for trans-\ngender youth are unknown) (Mustanski et al. 2011; Saewyc\net al. 1999; Saewyc et al. 2009).\nThe focus of sexual health education historically has\nbeen on heterosexual sexuality, with emphasis on procre-\nation, presumably or explicitly directed to the confines of\nmarriage (Carter 2001). For more than 100 years, educators\nhave grappled with the issue of how to teach youth about\nsexuality while promoting premarital chastity and marital\nmonogamy, a dilemma that has often led to sacrifices of\nscientific accuracy in favor of ideology (Carter 2001). As a\nresult LGBTQ youth are often excluded or left without\nrelevant and necessary information to make safe and\neffective choices. Despite potential breadth, the dominant\nfocus of sexuality education programs initially focused on\nthe public health outcomes such as the prevention of\nunintended pregnancy, and since the mid-1980s, prevention\nof HIV/AIDS and STIs. Before HIV/AIDS, there was\nmostly silence on LGBTQ sexualities in sexual health\neducation. Debates in the late 1990s became dominated by\nabstinence in sexual health education, a stark contrast to\nJ Youth Adolescence (2014) 43:1595–1610 1599\n123\ngrowing scientific knowledge about the efficacy of com-\nprehensive sexuality education. In addition to other faults\ndescribed above, the introduction of AOUM programs\nactively thwarted momentum to include LGBTQ youth\nneeds in sexual health education by emphasizing absti-\nnence until heterosexual marriage among high-school\nyouth in different-sex relationships. Only since 2004 has\nmarriage for same-sex couples been possible (to date more\nthan a dozen states and the District of Columbia permit\nsame-sex couples to marry); thus, for many LGBTQ youth,\nthe AOUM message actively erases potential for compre-\nhensive sexual health education. Moreover, some absti-\nnence-only program content includes unequivocally hostile\nmessages about LGBTQ people (Cianciotto and Cahill\n2003).\nSeveral empirical studies have begun to document the\nways that abstinence programs may undermine LGBTQ\nyouth sexual health and well-being (Kosciw et al. 2012).\nOne report showed that compared to schools with other\ntypes of sexuality education, LGBTQ students who atten-\nded schools that taught abstinence-only programs faced\ngreater harassment in the form of anti-LGBTQ remarks.\nFurther, by excluding sexual minorities (or in some cases\ngiving disparaging information about them), abstinence-\nonly programs may produce feelings of rejection and being\ndisconnected to school (Kosciw et al. 2012). These feelings\nmay lead to negative mental health outcomes such as\ndepression and anxiety and serve as precursors for other\nhealth risk behaviors (Almeida et al. 2009; Kosciw et al.\n2012). On the other hand, there is evidence that inclusive\nstrategies can promote sexual health for LGBTQ students.\nFor example, Blake et al. (2001) found that LGB students\nin schools with gay-sensitive HIV instruction reported\nlower sexual risk taking and substance use.\nNot only may LGBTQ students be invisible or margin-\nalized in sexuality education, but their health needs may\nnot align with the sexual health education needs of students\ninvolved in different-sex relationships or sexual activity. If\nthe risk for disease is presented only with reference to\npenile-vaginal sexual behaviors, there may be deleterious\nconsequences for the health of those who engage in same-\nsex relationships or sexual activity. For example, HPV\nposes a threat to all male and female youth, including\ncancer risk stemming from same- as well as different-sex\nsexual activity. However, if education only refers to het-\nerosexual vaginal transmission, youth may erroneously\nconclude that HPV risk pertains only to heterosexual\nvaginal sex. Such an approach would obscure other sexual\nbehaviors that pose risk for HPV, such as non-penetrative\nsexual contact, even though the prevalence of HPV among\nwomen who have never engaged in vaginal intercourse is\nhigh, as is the risk for anal cancer associated with HPV\namong men who engage in receptive anal intercourse\n(Mayer et al. 2008). Heterosexual bias in sexuality edu-\ncation will leave some youth without critical knowledge\nthey need to make safe sexual choices.\nOnly nine states require that sexual health education\nprograms provide inclusive information on sexual orien-\ntation (Guttmacher Institute 2013). Seven states (and\nmultiple localities) have laws that expressly forbid dis-\ncussion of LGBTQ issues (including sexual health and\nHIV/AIDS awareness) in a positive light, if at all; of those,\nthree states (Alabama, South Carolina, and Texas) require\nthat sexuality education programs include negative mes-\nsages about same-sex sexuality (Guttmacher Institute 2013;\nMcGovern 2012). Alabama law criminalizes same-sex\nrelationships and sexual behavior and proclaims them to be\n‘‘not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public.’’ Addi-\ntionally, the law asserts that this position comes from a\n‘‘factual manner and from a public health perspective.’’\nThis discriminating law is not unique; there are other laws\nthroughout the country that work to stigmatize LGBTQ\npeople, including youth in the classroom, by expressly\nforbidding discussion of LGBTQ issues in a positive\nmanner (McGovern 2012). Meanwhile, two proposed fed-\neral laws have languished; the Safe Schools Improvement\nAct (2013 S. 403) and the Student Non-Discrimination Act\n(2013 HR 1652) would explicitly provide protection to\nLGBTQ students in US schools, and create a supportive\npolicy context for inclusive health policies and programs.\nIn spite of this discouraging context for sexuality edu-\ncation, the pace of social change regarding LGBTQ\ninclusion has been extraordinary, as evidenced, for exam-\nple, by the growing number of US states and other nations\nthat permit marriage for same-sex couples. Beyond sexu-\nality education programs, there is an emerging body of\nevidence that documents specific educational practices and\nstrategies that create positive school climates for LGBTQ\nyouth, including inclusive anti-discrimination and anti-\nbullying policies and laws, school personnel training and\nadvocacy, access to LGBTQ-related resources and curric-\nula, and gay-straight alliance (GSA) school clubs (Russell\net al. 2010). A number of studies show that these strategies\nare linked to adolescent academic achievement and mental\nand behavioral health (Blake et al. 2001; Goodenow et al.\n2006; Poteat et al. 2013).Thus, a growing body of evidence\npoints to principles for promoting adolescent health in\nways that respect and include LGBTQ youth, and that\nrespond to known inequities many LGBTQ youth experi-\nence. These principles should inform the evidence base for\nfederal sexual health education programs and policies.\nGender and Sexual Health Education\nA second area in which current scientific thinking and\nsexual health education policy and programs are not\n1600 J Youth Adolescence (2014) 43:1595–1610\n123\naligned concerns the impact of gender (in)equity and\ngender norms. Research across disciplines has demon-\nstrated that gender norms and inequities are key factors in\nshaping health generally, and sexual health in particular\n(Rogow and Haberland 2005). International health orga-\nnizations have recognized that promoting gender equity is\ncritical to advancing health across the life course (World\nHealth Organization 2002). Domestically, Healthy People\n2020 includes gender and gender identity as dimensions\nlinked to health disparities—that is, systematic obstacles to\nhealth—and it aspires to reduce those disparities. But in the\n‘‘Adolescent Health’’ section, the document is silent about\nthe need to address gender inequities or harmful gender\nbeliefs.3 Establishing gender equity and challenging gender\nbeliefs that research has shown to be harmful to adolescent\nsexual health have never been central goals in US adoles-\ncent sexual health and education policy (DeLamater 2007).\nIn fact, many abstinence-only and abstinence-only-until-\nmarriage programs have taught gender stereotypes as facts\n(Curran 2011; Delamater 2007; Fine and McClelland\n2006). Even approaches that include information beyond\nabstinence have perpetuated gender inequities through\ngender stereotyping implicit in curricula or teachers’\ninformal communications (Curran 2011; Fields 2008;\nGarcia 2009, 2012).\nIt has long been established among researchers that\ngender inequities, and the gender ideologies that uphold\nthem, are key factors in shaping sexual and reproductive\nhealth globally and domestically, affecting STIs, HIV/\nAIDS, unintended pregnancies, and sexual violence (Ro-\ngow and Haberland 2005; Santana et al. 2006). Scholars\nhave documented how traditional gender roles impede\nwomen’s sexual autonomy and self-efficacy, and thereby\nincrease their vulnerability to STIs and HIV, intimate\npartner violence, unwanted sex, and unintended pregnancy\n(Amaro and Raj 2000; Amaro et al. 2001; Impett et al.\n2006; Jewkes 2010; Phillips 2000). Gender-based rela-\ntional power imbalances impact women’s capacity to\nadvocate for their own sexual safety (Phillips 2000; Ro-\nsenthal and Levy 2010). For instance, compared to women\nwho report low levels of relationship power, women with\nhigher levels are five times as likely to report consistent\ncondom use (Pulerwitz et al. 2002). Cultural beliefs about\ngender can also have negative health consequences for men\nby, for instance, encouraging risk behavior (Higgins et al.\n2010).\nGender ideologies shape how youth view and experi-\nence themselves and each other. Researchers have\ndocumented how schools, peer culture and other institu-\ntions overtly and covertly communicate distinct gender\nideologies about sex and romance to young people\n(Chambers et al. 2004; Eder et al. 1995; Fields 2008;\nPascoe 2007). Traditional gender ideologies frequently link\nmasculinity with heterosexual sexual activity, sex drive,\nsexual initiation, and lack of emotional involvement, and\nfemininity with sexual passivity, sexual restraint, respon-\nsibility for controlling boys’ desires, and emotional over-\ninvolvement (Allen 2003; Bay-Cheng 2003). The sexual\ndouble standard, which encourages and celebrates hetero-\nsexual sexual experience in teenage boys but censures and\nstigmatizes sexual experience in teenage girls, is endemic\nin the United States, though it varies by local context and\nculture (Crawford and Popp 2003; Greene and Faulkner\n2005; Marston and King 2006).\nThe sexual double standard harms girls by stigmatizing\ntheir sexual desires and experiences, reducing their nego-\ntiating power within sexual encounters, and conditioning\ngirls to believe that their own desires and wishes are less\nsignificant than those of their male partners (Hamilton and\nArmstrong 2009; Holland et al. 1998; Martin 1996; Tolman\n2002). Negative cultural beliefs about girls’ sexuality can\nmake it difficult for them to disclose their sexual histories\nto partners, parents, or adult care providers (Greene and\nFaulkner 2005; Schalet 2011a, b). Traditional gender roles\ncan also hinder girls in refusing unwanted sex and insisting\non condom use (Impett et al. 2006; Kirkman et al. 1998;\nPetitifor 2012). Possessing a sense of sexual self-efficacy—\na sense that one has power over one’s sexual decision\nmaking—seems to be especially important in aiding girls to\nengage in safer sex behaviors (Gutierrez et al. 2000;\nPearson 2006). There is additional evidence to suggest that\nwhen girls know about, and feel entitled to, sexual plea-\nsure, they are better able to advocate for themselves and\ntheir sexual health, leading scholars to call on sexual health\neducation to challenge the double standard and emphasize\nthe value of girls’ desires and pleasure (Hirst 2013; Horne\nand Zimmerbeck 2006; Impett et al. 2006; Martin 1996;\nTolman 2002).\nBoys are also disadvantaged by prevailing gender ide-\nologies. The sexual double standard can make it appear as\nif boys should always desire sex, and never say no to sex,\neven risky sex (Bowleg et al. 2000). The prevailing ide-\nologies stigmatize boys’ emotional vulnerabilities and\nneeds, including their needs for intimate friendships and\nromantic relationships, making them less prepared to have\nintimate relationships (Giordano et al. 2006; Way et al.\n2013). They also stigmatize homosexuality and behaviors\nassociated with homosexuality (Kimmel 2008; Klein 2012;\nPascoe 2007). Norms about appropriate male behavior\naffect all males. But those who adhere most to ‘‘tradi-\ntional’’ beliefs about masculinity—for instance, that men\n3 One of the goals in this section is to increase the proportion of\nsecondary schools that ‘‘prohibit harassment based on a student’s\nsexual orientation or gender identity.’’ This goal is important but does\nnot in itself encourage schools to promote gender equity or address\nthe effects of harmful gender beliefs in sexual health education.\nJ Youth Adolescence (2014) 43:1595–1610 1601\n123\nshould be tough, have status in society, not behave in ways\nmarked as ‘‘feminine,’’ and regularly have heterosexual\nsex— are most at risk for negative consequences compared\nto other boys and men. Those who embrace such traditional\nattitudes toward masculinity tend to also report more sex-\nual partners, engage in more unprotected vaginal sex, and\nshow less self-efficacy and consistency in condom use\n(Noar and Morokoff 2002; Pleck et al. 1993, 1994; Santana\net al. 2006; Shearer et al. 2005).\nThere is growing evidence that among adult men some\nmasculine gender norms are linked to violence in intimate\nrelationships (Gallagher and Parrott 2011; Murnen et al.\n2002). For example, compared to other men, men who\nreport more traditional masculinity ideologies are more\nlikely to report having perpetrated violence or sexual\ncoercion (Marı´n et al. 1997; Santana et al. 2006). Con-\nversely, compared to less egalitarian men, men whose\ngender role ideologies are more egalitarian report fewer\ninstances of physical aggression against their intimate\npartners (Fitzpatrick et al. 2004). Gender norms also shape\nyoung people’s capacities to resist, report, and recover\nfrom sexual violation. Boys are unlikely to report sexual\ncoercion due to homophobia as well as masculinity norms\nthat emphasize male sexual desire and strength and\nobfuscate boys’ capacity to be coerced or intimately vio-\nlated (Bullock and Beckson 2011). For girls, the pressure to\nbe normatively feminine (sexually passive, accommodat-\ning, ‘‘nice’’) can make resistance to unwanted sexual\nadvances difficult (Armstrong et al. 2006; Hamilton and\nArmstrong 2009; Phillips 2000). The stigma around girls’\nsexuality also prevents many from seeking help, a barrier\nthat is heightened for low-income girls and girls of color\n(Collins 2005; Froyum 2010).\nIn short, there is strong and consistent evidence that\ngender beliefs and (in)equities shape sexual health (Ro-\ngow and Haberland 2005). However, until recently, these\nareas have received very little attention in US adolescent\nsexual health policy and programming (Grose et al. 2014;\nRolleri 2013a; Rolleri 2013b). There is no requirement for\nfederally-funded sexuality education to work toward\ngender equity, avoid explicit or implicit gender stereo-\ntyping, or include modules that help students challenge\nharmful gender beliefs. Abstinence-oriented programs\nhave often taught gender stereotypes as fact (DeLamater\n2007; Fine and McClelland 2006; Curran 2011).4\nApproaches that include information beyond abstinence\ncan also perpetuate gender ideologies through the topics\nthey cover and leave out, or include implicit gender\nstereotyping in apparently gender-neutral exercises and\nrole plays (Bay-Cheng 2003; Curran 2011; Fields 2008).\nUnless harmful gender beliefs are explicitly addressed and\nchallenged, sexual health education runs the risk of\nreinforcing those beliefs through the taken-for-granted\nassumptions teachers and students bring into the class-\nroom (Fields 2008; Garcia 2009, 2012; Froyum 2010).\nYet, of the 35 designated (Tier 1) ‘‘evidence-based’’\nprograms, only a handful (all of which target youth of\ncolor) even mention gender in their program description,\nsuggesting incorrectly that only minority groups contend\nwith harmful gender beliefs (Office of Adolescent Health\n2014a).5 The research record shows the advisability of\nensuring that all sexual health programs are free from\nharmful gender beliefs—which may be explicit or implicit\nin the curricula—and include tools to help students\naddress and challenge these beliefs.\nPoverty, Inequality, and Sexual Health Education\nConsiderable literature has demonstrated that poverty and\neconomic inequalities are fundamental barriers to positive\nyouth development. Youth subject to these inequalities\nhave lower academic achievement, and are more likely to\nleave school early, thereby compounding cumulative\nsocioeconomic effects on health. Youth in poverty are also\nmore likely to engage in delinquent behavior, to become\nsexually active early, and to have elevated risk of STIs,\nunintended pregnancies, and non-marital births (Brooks-\nGunn et al. 1997; Dinkelman et al. 2008; Duncan and\nRodgers 1988; Duncan et al. 2010; Grantham-McGregor\net al. 2007). Youth in poverty also lack access to quality\nhealth services (National Research Council 2009). The\neffects of persistent poverty are especially pernicious,\naffecting socio-emotional development and health, and\nincreasing the likelihood of enduring ill effects into\nadulthood.\nThe deleterious effects of poverty are critical consider-\nations for adolescent health and development in the United\nStates, where low-income students now comprise a near\nmajority of public school children in the United States.6\nAbout one in six of all youth and one in three African\nAmerican youth ages 12–17 live in families with incomes\n4 One recent study of popular abstinence-only program content found\na softening of some older gender stereotypes alongside the emergence\nof new ones, including the manipulative female leading a male astray\n(Lamb et al. 2013).\n5 Without a systematic content analysis of these programs, it is\ndifficult to assess whether they merely mention gender or actively\nseek to change unhealthy gender norms. One tier 1, evidence-based\nintervention that does the latter is SiHLE (Rolleri 2013a). Encour-\nagingly, under its Tier 2 funding, the Office of Adolescent Health has\nfunded Gender Matters, an ‘‘innovative gender transformative\nprogram,’’ noting that ‘‘addressing gender norms is essential to\nimproving the health of teens, but often prevention programs leave\nout these discussions’’ (Office of Adolescent Health 2014b, p. 1).\n6 Defined by eligibility for the federal free and reduced-price meals\nprogram in the 2010–2011 school year; Suitts et al. 2013.\n1602 J Youth Adolescence (2014) 43:1595–1610\n123\nbelow the official poverty level.7 In addition to the close\nlinkage between minority racial/ethnic status and poverty,\nthere are major racial disparities in long-term exposure to\nneighborhood poverty. Analyses of data from the Panel\nStudy of Income Dynamics indicate that 40 % of African\nAmericans experience sustained exposure to high-poverty\nneighborhoods, versus 5 % of non-Blacks (Wodtke 2013).\nThe negative consequences of poverty are a function of\nthe structural and experiential inequalities that typify the\nlife contexts of impoverished youth. Poor youth are more\nlikely to live in neighborhoods characterized by adverse\nphysical and social environments, with higher rates of\ncrime and limited access to recreational facilities and after-\nschool programs, and are more likely to attend lower\nquality schools with fewer resources (Murry et al. 2011).\nThey are also less likely to have access to mental and\nphysical health services. Exposure to poverty during ado-\nlescence may be especially important, given adolescents’\nexpanding social world. Recent analyses suggest that sus-\ntained exposure to neighborhood poverty substantially\nincreases the risk of becoming an adolescent parent, and\nthat exposure during adolescence may have a greater effect\nthan exposure earlier in childhood (Wodtke 2013). Further,\npoverty shapes sexual network structure, increasing the\nlikelihood of STIs (Fichtenberg et al. 2010). These contexts\nmold adolescents’ sexual knowledge, perceptions about\nand access to contraception, and their hope for the future.\nPoverty intersects with individual and structural char-\nacteristics to generate significant health disparities, the\ncumulative health differences that result from obstacles\nlinked to factors such as race/ethnicity, gender, disability,\nsexual orientation, and gender identity. A recent review of\nhealth disparities in the United States (CDC 2013d) doc-\numented persistent race/ethnicity disparities in health out-\ncomes, access to health care, adoption of health promoting\nbehavior, and exposure to health promoting environments,\nwith no evidence of a temporal decrease between 2005 and\n2009. Documented disparities, beyond those related to\nsexual and reproductive health, include differences in\nchronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes and hyper-\ntension, as well as differences in mortality from causes\nsuch as coronary heart disease, stroke, drugs, homicide,\nsuicide, and vehicle related injuries (CDC 2013d).\nThus, the adverse impact of poverty is compounded by\nracism, sexism, heterosexism, and discrimination against\nindividuals with disabilities. These prejudicial belief sys-\ntems reflect irrational biases toward members of a certain\nrace, biological sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or\nlevel of ability on the basis that a certain group is ‘‘supe-\nrior/inferior’’ or ‘‘normal/abnormal.’’ Structural racism/\nsexism/heterosexism, that is, ‘‘macrolevel systems, social\nforces, institutions, ideologies, and processes that interact\nwith one another to generate and reinforce inequities\namong… groups’’ (Gee and Ford 2011; p. 116), normalizes\nand legitimizes unequal treatment and discrimination\nStructural discrimination can take many forms, including\nsocial segregation (e.g., neighborhood, schools, health care\nfacilities) and exclusionary immigration policy, and can\npersist across generations through the cumulative effects of\ninteracting systems. For example, because of racial dis-\ncrimination in the real estate industry African Americans\nare considerably more likely to live in poor neighborhoods,\neven if economic resources would permit residing in non-\npoor neighborhoods (Iceland and Scopilliti 2008).\nThe Intersectionality Framework (see for example,\nWeber and Parra-Medina 2003) proposes that characteris-\ntics such as race, class and gender are not distinct social\ncategories. They reflect multidimensional and overlapping\nexperiences that are a function of mutually reinforcing\nsocial processes and institutions. The intersection of mi-\ncrolevel identities and macrolevel structural factors can\naffect health by producing and sustaining economic\ninequality via groups’ access to social, economic, and\npolitical resources and privileges. The effects of neigh-\nborhood disadvantage on school dropout, for example, are\ntwice as large for African American youth versus their\nWhite peers (Crowder and South 2003). Community pov-\nerty levels also contribute to LGBT youth’s experiences in\nschool; youth in higher poverty communities report more\nvictimization in school because of sexual orientation and\ngender expression than those in more affluent communities\n(Kosciw et al. 2009). Poverty and racial segregation can\nalso affect the sexual expectations and behavior of youth,\nleading youth in these contexts to consider early sexual\nactivity as normal and even expected. Youth in low income\nneighborhoods may not have access to educational and\noccupational opportunities, and may view sexual activity as\na pathway to social status rather than an obstacle to\nsocioeconomic achievement (Ramirez-Valles et al. 2002).\nThe intersections of poverty, inequality, structural dis-\ncrimination, and adolescent sexual and reproductive health\nare numerous. Sexual health education exists within a\nvariety of structural and social contexts (Fine and McC-\nlelland 2006). Sexuality affects, and is affected by, com-\nplex interactions between individual biopsychosocial\nfactors and a host of economic, political and cultural fac-\ntors. Sexuality and sexual rights are thus interwoven with\nbroader human rights and the sociopolitical issues that\naffect those rights, such as economic inequality and\nstructural racism. Approaching adolescent sexual health\nwith an eye toward poverty and its intersections with\ndiverse social identities means attention to not only mate-\nrial deprivation but also to social and political exclusion\n7 More than one in three of all young people, 12–17, live in ‘‘near-\npoverty’’ (often considered a more accurate measure).\nJ Youth Adolescence (2014) 43:1595–1610 1603\n123\nand restrictions on rights, including sexual rights (Armas\n2007), that are linked to behavior. Poverty limits knowl-\nedge about and access to sexual and reproductive health\nservices, constrains positive sexual expression and feelings\nof self-efficacy, and makes disadvantaged youth vulnerable\nto sexual exploitation and violence. This is why the\nexperience of poverty is associated with greater sexual\nrisk-taking (e.g., early sexual onset, multiple sexual part-\nnerships, lack of condom use) in both the United States and\nglobal contexts (Brooks-Gunn et al. 1997; Dodoo et al.\n2007; Duncan and Rodgers 1988).\nUS policy makers must understand and address the\nimportance of poverty’s complex intersections with diverse\nidentities and the impact on how youth respond to sexuality\neducation. Sexual health education paradigms and curricula\noften assume adolescents are in school and that they live in\nhomogeneous social and physical environments free of\neconomic or other social barriers. Sexuality education may\nexplicitly or inadvertently reinforce cultural stereotypes\nabout young people of color, who are more likely to be\npoor, as sexually irresponsible (Fine and McClelland 2006;\nFields 2008; Garcia 2009, 2012). Similarly, sexual health\neducation may presume ‘‘proper’’ relationships and family\nforms that are less common among low income youth or\nyouth of color. With few economic opportunities and\nresources to develop positive sexual identities, low income\nor minority youth may rely on rigid, exclusionary, and\nultimately counterproductive frameworks to assert self-\nand group-worth (Froyum 2007). Failure to recognize\nerroneous assumptions and the lived reality of youth can\nlead to unintended effects on adolescent sexuality, pro-\nmoting exclusion of teens who do not conform to expected\ngender and sexual norms and ultimately failing to reduce\ninequality (Bedford 2008; Drucker 2009). Sexual health\neducation must thus recognize the diverse life course tra-\njectories and family formations that characterize students’\nlives. In addition, scholars have argued, sexual health\neducation must create opportunities for students to discuss\nsexual agency and risks in the context of their broader life\naspirations and the multifold factors that constraints those\naspirations (Fields 2008; Fine and McClelland 2006; Ro-\ngow and Haberland 2005). Although sexual health educa-\ntion cannot remove the structural disparities, by giving\nyoung people the opportunity to critically examine the\ninequalities they encounter, it can bolster their ability to\nrespond to them.\nPolicy makers must also promote adolescent sexual and\nreproductive health by investing in youth through multi-\nfaceted and multi-level poverty alleviation efforts that\nbuild youth assets and promote health. Despite frequently\nvoiced concerns about the intractable nature of poverty\n(and by extension, hopelessness), the United States has a\ntrack record of intentional and effective large-scale\nimplementation of poverty alleviation. In the late 1950s\n22 % of US residents lived in poverty; after the launch of\nthe War on Poverty in the 1960s, that percentage had\ndropped to 11 % by 1973 (Council of Economic Advisors\n2014). Changes were even more drastic among the elderly,\nwho once had the country’s highest poverty rates, but\nwhose chances of living in poverty have been sharply\nreduced through programs such as Social Security and\nMedicare (Fischer et al. 1996).\nToday, the poverty rate of US children and teens is among\nthe highest in the industrial world. Given the pervasive det-\nrimental effects on youth development, poverty alleviation\nprograms are vital to improving adolescent sexual and\nreproductive health. Indeed, comparing across five devel-\noped nations, where rates of sexual activity among youth\nwere similar, Singh and colleagues report a strong associa-\ntion between the higher US teen birth rate and the greater\nproportion of teens who grow up poor (Singh et al. 2001). Yet\nthere is strong evidence that structural interventions can both\ndirectly and indirectly improve adolescent health, and that\nlarge-scale implementation is both feasible and successful\n(Snell et al. 2013). In many European, Latin American, and\nAfrican countries, governments offer a variety of income\nsupplements, especially to families with children. Singh\net al. (2001) point toward policies that are likely to affect\nadolescent sexual and reproductive health specifically,\nincluding national health care systems and government\ninvestment in job training and opportunities for young peo-\nple, easing the transition into adulthood, facilitating long-\nterm planning, and reducing the motivation to have a child\nprematurely. The authors conclude ‘‘improving adolescents’\nsocioeconomic status is a way to prevent their having poor\nreproductive health outcomes—not only unplanned or early\npregnancies or births, but also STDs’’ (p. 258).\nPolicy makers should heed lessons learned from our\ncountry’s success in reducing poverty among the elderly,\nand from other countries’ successes in better promoting\nadolescent sexual and reproductive health by investing in\nmulti-faceted and multi-level poverty alleviation efforts\nthat build youth assets and promote health. For individual\nadolescents, efforts are needed to enhance adolescents’\nmotivation for personal and professional achievement (e.g.,\nhealthy interpersonal relationships, education and occupa-\ntion), and avoid behaviors that increase risks of STIs, poor\nemotional and physical health, and early pregnancy and\nchildbearing. We also need to target structural barriers\ncreated by economic, racial and ethnic inequalities (e.g.,\nincrease resources for high-poverty schools), and offer\nsupport services to help families and their children (e.g.,\nadequate funding for Title X family planning clinics) as\nthey move toward better financial security, without predi-\ncation of assistance on particular family structures that may\nnot be feasible for or desired by all individuals.\n1604 J Youth Adolescence (2014) 43:1595–1610\n123\nConclusions and Recommendations\nUS federal sexual health policy has come a long way since\nthe introduction of AOUM policies when federally funded\nprograms were often medically inaccurate, were prohibited\nfrom teaching the health benefits of condoms and contra-\nception, and were required to teach students that sex outside\nof heterosexual marriage would damage them. In providing\nour critique we acknowledge the strides that have been\nmade in current federal policies and initiatives, and we also\nacknowledge that US sexual health education programs and\npolicies exist in a cultural and political context that is not\nfully conducive to holistic approaches to adolescent sexual\nhealth education, or to the full range of contemporary sci-\nence in this field. The current ‘‘evidence-based’’ policy,\nwhile a significant leap forward, is limited in a number of\nways. The US federal policy continues to fund abstinence-\nonly programs as part of its Teen Pregnancy Prevention\nInitiative as well as other funding streams. But more\nimportant, the definition of scientific evidence is limited to a\nnarrow understanding of what constitutes the broad scien-\ntific evidence for adolescent sexual and reproductive health.\nThe current policy does not require programs to be engaged\nwith the breadth of current scientific thinking about ado-\nlescents and their sexual health.\nWe have sought to highlight the limitations of EBIs by\nexamining three bodies of literature on topics about which\nthere is growing scientific consensus. This evidence indi-\ncates that adolescent sexual health is undermined by the\nexclusion and stigmatization of LGBTQ youth, gender\ninequities and stereotypes, and poverty and structural rac-\nism. Likewise, the research shows that greater inclusive-\nness, more gender and economic equity, and freedom from\nharmful stereotypes, all benefit young people and their\nsexual health. And yet, although there are some excellent\nprograms that approach adolescent sexuality holistically\n(see for instance, International Sexuality and HIV Curric-\nulum Working Group 2011), federal policy does not\nrequire its recipients of funds to address these critical\ntopics, and indeed very few federally funded programs do.8\nWhen federally funded sexual health education does not\nintentionally address these topics, it may overtly or inad-\nvertently promulgate gender, sexual orientation, class, and\nracial stereotyping, and fail to give youth resources to\ncombat them. Gender, heterosexual, economic and racial\nbiases in sexual health education leave youth without the\npersonal agency and the critical knowledge they need to\nmake safer sexual choices.\nBased on these considerations, we offer several recom-\nmendations for federal sexual health education policy, as\nwell as for more effective translation of science into poli-\ncymaking and programming. First, adolescent sexual and\nreproductive health policy should be based on scientific\ninput from a broad range of disciplines, including social,\nbehavioral, medical, and public health sciences. The full\nrange of scientific evidence should guide adolescent sexual\nand reproductive health policies, including adolescent\nsexual health education. Federally-funded programs must\naddress gender, poverty, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-\ngender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. Federal\npolicy makers should engage in conversation with the\nbroad range of scientific communities and professional\nsocieties. Policy makers and federal program administra-\ntors must draw on scientific advisors to help translate the\nbroader evidence base, and guide the development of\ninterventions that reflect current scientific thinking. Fur-\nther, scientists must become actively engaged in the\ntranslation of their work for policy and practice.\nSecond, sexual health education should be inclusive of\na wide range of viewpoints and populations without\nstigmatizing any group. It should avoid heteronormative\napproaches and aim to strengthen young people’s capacity\nto challenge harmful stereotypes. In cooperation with\nscientists and health professional associations, content\nguidelines should be established for federally-funded\nsexuality education programs to assure medical accuracy\nas well as gender equity and inclusion of LGBTQ youth.\nThis should be a priority across federal agencies and\nthroughout the Department of Health and Human Ser-\nvices, including the CDC, Administration for Children\nand Families, and the Office of Adolescent Health (in\nparticular, in its next round of teen pregnancy prevention\nprograms).\nFinally, sexuality education programs and policies must\nacknowledge the role that structural and contextual factors\nplay in sexual risk. Comprehensive sexuality education\nshould recognize personal, interpersonal, social, economic\nand cultural factors that shape adolescents’ sexual moti-\nvations and behaviors. A fundamental goal must be the\nremoval of economic, gender and LGBTQ disparities in\nadolescent sexual and reproductive health through laws,\nregulations, and funding requirements.\nStructural inequalities that are critical barriers to ado-\nlescent sexual health promotion are at the heart of some of\nthe most contested issues in American society: the sexual\norientation of adolescents, concepts of gender, and eco-\nnomic and racial inequalities. When federally funded\nhealth interventions do not engage directly with these\nissues, and thus ignore the broader scientific consensus\nregarding adolescent sexual and reproductive health, they\nrun the risk of reproducing these inequalities (Fine and\n8 Encouragingly, the federal government has, under its tier 2 funding\nfor experimental programs, supported program development and\nevaluation in some of research areas we have highlighted, including a\nprogram to address and change harmful gender beliefs.\nJ Youth Adolescence (2014) 43:1595–1610 1605\n123\nMcClelland 2006). By incorporating the full range of sci-\nentific evidence regarding adolescent sexual and repro-\nductive health, federal, state, and local efforts will be best\npositioned to promote adolescent health and well-being.\nAcknowledgments This paper began as a series of conversations\nabout the role of science in sexuality education and adolescent health\npolicy among the four primary authors and leaders of the Future of\nSex Education group.
