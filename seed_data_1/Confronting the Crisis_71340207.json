Section II offers a summary list of the action items necessary to improvethe lives of District LGBTQ youth. Section III presents detailed information about eachof the eight major focus areas, including supporting data. The eight major focus areasof this document include: schools and education; shelter and housing; jobs andlife skills; after-school time; mental health, substance abuse, and HIV;violence and victimization; Latino/a LGBTQ youth; and transgender youth.Who We Are:For over twenty years, the Sexual Minority Youth Assistance League (SMYAL) hasprovided services to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youthin the D.C. metropolitan area. In that time, we have seen some positive changes asawareness of LGBTQ youth issues grows in our community. We have also seen each newgeneration of LGBTQ youth encounter many of the same problems of generations pastas they struggle to find their place in the world. As part of our mission, we educate ourcommunity members and advocate for change until our society is a safe space for allLGBTQ youth.Who We Serve:In 2005, SMYAL provided services to 494unduplicated LGBTQ youth for a total of3,023 youth contacts. In addition tobeing LGBTQ, 97% of youth served bySMYAL are youth of color. We servemost of our youth through our after-school Youth Center on Capitol Hillwhere 99% are African-American. Ouryouth face many developmental andsocietal challenges specific to theirsexual orientation and gender identity,in addition to problems associated withracial marginalization.Current social science research shows that LGBTQ youth, especially  LGBTQ youth ofcolor, are more likely to encounter significant risks to their health and wellbeing,including drug and alcohol dependency, high drop-out rates, increased incidence ofHIV/AIDS infection and other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as mental healthissues. They are often targets of verbal, mental, and physical abuse from parents,peers, and society as a whole. Many are kicked out of their homes.Developing a Plan:In September 2005, SMYAL facilitated two focus groups, one with SMYAL youth and onewith SMYAL staff, to discuss the challenges District LGBTQ young people face in theirdaily lives. From these discussions, SMYAL staff members identified major areas ofneed, discussed possible solutions and strategies, and determined concrete actions toaddress these issues.Little data exists about the needs of LGBTQ youth or specifically LGBTQ youth of color inthe District of Columbia. For this reason, we have used the results of the focus groupsand data from recent studies of LGBTQ youth from around the country to help createthe recommendations in this document.LGBTQ youth are more likelyto engage in unsafe sex, beabused at school and athome, be forced onto thestreet, fall prey to alcohol,tobacco and illegal drugs,and commit suicide.1I. introduction2The following recommendations are based upon focus groups conducted withSMYAL youth and SMYAL staff. Based upon our findings, we strongly encourage theDistrict of Columbia to institute the following actions.Creating Safe and Affirming Schools:All DCPS schools and charter schools must implement the following practices:• Enforce existing Sexual Harassment and Harassment Policy that protects studentsfrom physical and verbal abuse relating to their actual or perceived sexualorientation or gender identity (DCMR, Title 5, Education: 2503.2.g-h).• Include LGBTQ youth issues in both HIV prevention and comprehensive sexualityeducation curricula.• Require and provide LGBTQ youth cultural competency training and harassmentand bullying prevention training for all staff members.• Collect data about LGBTQ youth living in the District by including sexualorientation and gender identity as variables in annual Youth Risk Behavior Survey.Dedicated Shelter and Housing:• D.C. must provide dedicated beds for LGBTQ youth in its existing fundedtransitional and  emergency housing facilities or, preferably, fund a new programspecifically dedicated to providing emergency housing for LGBTQ youth.• D.C. must provide private rooms and bathrooms for transgender youth so theydo not need to share accommodations with people of either gender.• All employees of organizations housing youth must be trained and evaluatedbased on their cultural competency with LGBTQ youth.• D.C. must provide outreach, emergency services, and referral to emergencyhousing to homeless and street youth with expertise and focus on LGBTQhomeless youth.Jobs and Life Skills:• D.C. must ensure appropriate regulations for the recent “Human RightsClarification Act” are created to enforce employment protection for transgenderyouth.• D.C. must fund job training and referral programs specifically developed forLGBTQ youth of color, with specific focus on transgender youth.Safe ‘Out-of-School Time’:• D.C. must designate funding specifically for after-school, late night and weekendprograms for LGBTQ youth, especially LGBTQ youth of color.• D.C. must work with private and community-based organizations to provideappropriate spaces in DCPS buildings, community recreation centers, and otherD.C. government buildings for safe space activities for LGBTQ youth.Increased Funding for Expert Mental Health, Substance Abuse and HIVPrevention and Treatment Services:• Ensure all Department of Mental Health Service Providers are trained to identifyand work with LGBTQ youth with mental health issues.• Identify available clinicians with expertise in working with LGBTQ youth and referLGBTQ youth to these specialists.II. recommendations3Increased Funding for Expert Mental Health, Substance Abuse and HIVPrevention and Treatment Services (continued):• Provide funding and ensure availability of substance abuse prevention andtreatment programs specifically targeted for LGBTQ youth, including “clubdrugs” and crystal methamphetamine.• D.C. must dramatically expand HIV prevention, outreach, and counseling,testing, and referral funds specifically targeting LGBTQ youth 13-24 years oldwith specific focus on youth of color.Safe and Affirming Communities:• D.C. must track hate crimes based on both sexual orientation and genderidentity separately.• Mandate LGBTQ youth cultural competency training for all DC Police Officers.• Address violence participation and victimization of LGBTQ youth through crimeprevention strategies.• D.C. must fund domestic and relationship violence prevention and supportprograms specifically for LGBTQ youth, especially youth of color. Culturally Competent Services for LGBTQ Latino/a Youth:• D.C. must fund the creation of culturally competent safe spaces for LGBTQLatino/a Youth where they can receive services including preventive healthcare, emergency/transitional housing, substance abuse care, educationassistance, and support for other issues related to sexual orientation or genderidentity. This site must serve Latino/a LGBTQ youth regardless of economic andimmigration status and have a staff fluent in Spanish.• D.C. must fund the development of programs for LGBTQ Latino/a youth thatfocus on personal growth and leadership skills, preparing them to becomefuture community leaders, to advocate for their own needs, and to workwithin their community to change negative attitudes toward LGBTQ Latino/aindividuals.• D.C. must fund cultural and educational programs for Latino/a LGBTQ youth,their parents, peers, and their community which foster acceptance of theseyouth and help them identify with the entire Latino/a community.Jobs and Life Skills for Transgender Youth:• D.C. must ensure appropriate regulations for the recent “Human RightsClarification Act” are created to enforce employment protection fortransgender youth.• D.C. must fund job training and referral programs specifically developed fortransgender youth, especially youth of color.Safe Spaces for Transgender Youth:• D.C. must require and provide transgender youth cultural competency trainingand harassment and bullying prevention training for all DCPS faculty and staff.• D.C. must provide private rooms and bathrooms in emergency and transitionalhousing for transgender youth so they do not need to share accommodationswith people of either gender.• D.C. must track hate crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identityseparately.schools and educationViolence and Harassment at School:For LGBTQ youth, going to school means facing  abuse and violence on a dailybasis.• In a 2003 national study of LGBT middle and high school students, the Gay,Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) found that 84% of these LGBTyouth are verbally harassed at school each year due to their sexualorientation. Almost one in five (17%) are physically assaulted at school eachyear for the same reason.1• Many LGBT students stop going to school to avoid future abuse. GLSENreports that LGBT students who do not know about a school policyprotecting them from abuse are almost 40% more likely to skip school out offear.Inadequate Sexuality and HIV Prevention Education:Although LGBTQ youth face a heightened risk of HIV and other STD infection,many schools do not address their issues through sexuality education curricula.• In a 2004 focus group study of young men of color who have sex with men(YMCSM) in the metro DC area created by SMYAL and Metro Teen AIDS, only15% of these young men report receiving sexuality education from theirschool.2• A 2001 study shows that GLBstudents who received GLB-sensitive health educationreported fewer lifetimesexual partners (1.3 vs. 2.4)and were less likely to reportmaking a plan to commitsuicide (27.7% vs. 45.7%) andmissing school for personalsafety reasons (12.2% vs.23.4%).3Creating Safe and Affirming Schools:All DCPS schools and charter schools must implement the following practices:• Enforce existing Sexual Harassment and Harassment Policy that protectsstudents from physical and verbal abuse relating to their actual or perceivedsexual orientation or gender identity (DCMR, Title 5, Education: 2503.2.g-h).• Include LGBTQ youth issues in both HIV prevention and comprehensivesexuality education curricula.• Require and provide LGBTQ youth cultural competency training andharassment and bullying prevention training for all staff members.• Collect data about LGBTQ youth living in the District by including sexualorientation and gender identity as variables in annual Youth Risk BehaviorSurvey.Only 15% of young men ofcolor who have sex withmen in the metro DC areareport receiving sexualityeducation from theirschool.(SMYAL & MTA 2004)4III. issue areasHomelessness:Many LGBTQ youth are thrown out of their homes when their parents discovertheir sexual orientation or gender identity; others leave their homes to escapean abusive family.• In the 2004 focus group study held by SMYAL and Metro Teen AIDS, 35% ofyoung men of color who havesex with men reported beingphysically threatened orharmed by their immediatefamily members when theirfamilies learned of their sexualorientation.• A 2005 University of Texasstudy shows that 73% ofhomeless lesbian and gayadolescents and 25.6% ofbisexual homeless youth arehomeless because theirparents disapproved of theirsexual orientation.4• A 2002 study shows that homeless LGBT youths reported leaving home moreoften than their heterosexual peers (mean of 12.38 times vs. 6.69 times).5• With no source of income, these youth often turn to high-risk sex for survival.A 2000 study reveals that 46% of gay and bisexual young homeless men and23% of lesbian and bisexual young homeless women reported exchanging sexfor money, drugs, and other needs.6• In a survey of SMYAL youth, 35.9% of our LGBTQ youth reported running awayfrom home at least once.7 Of youth who reported running away, 30.8%reported leaving home three or more times.Dedicated Shelter and Housing:• D.C. must provide dedicated beds for LGBTQ youth in its existing fundedtransitional and  emergency housing facilities or, preferably, fund a newprogram specifically dedicated to providing emergency housing for LGBTQyouth.• D.C. must provide private rooms and bathrooms for transgender youth sothey do not need to share accommodations with people of either gender.• All employees of organizations housing youth must be trained and evaluatedbased on their cultural competency with LGBTQ youth.• D.C. must provide outreach, emergency services, and referral to emergencyhousing to homeless and street youth with expertise and focus on LGBTQhomeless youth.shelter and housing46% of gay and bisexualyoung homeless men and23% of lesbian and bisexualyoung homeless women re-port exchanging sex formoney, drugs, and otherneeds.(Youth & Society, 2000)5Employment Discrimination and Economic Disadvantage:Unsafe schools force many LGBTQ youth to drop out before graduating fromhigh school, significantly lowering their ability to find employment. These youthalso face employment discrimination due to employers’ bias against LGBTindividuals, which is especially problematic for transgender youth.• GLSEN also reports that LGBT students  who report significant harassment aretwice as likely to report that they do not intend to go to college and reportlower grade point averages (2.9 vs. 3.3). 9 The prevalence of in-schoolharassment and violence creates a chain reaction that harms LGBTQ youngpeople’s ability to succeed for the rest of their lives.• Some SMYAL youth are also at greater risk to drop out of high school or tolive in poverty because they live in the District of Columbia. The high schooldropout rate for D.C. students is 40% overall and 45% for African-Americanyouth.10• The Kaiser Family Foundation reports the District also has a higherpercentage of children 18 and under living in poverty compared to the restof the country (39% vs. 23%).11Jobs and Life Skills:• D.C. must ensure that appropriate regulations for the recent “Human RightsClarification Act” are created to enforce job protection for transgenderyouth.• D.C. must fund job training and referral programs specifically developed forLGBTQ youth of color, with specific focus on transgender youth.Too Few Safe ‘Out-of-School’ Activities:The constant threat of violence and harassment which LGBTQ youth experienceon a daily basis prevents them from participating in the extracurricular activitiescrucial to adolescent development. Many LGBTQ young people, seekingvalidation and community, frequent places unsafe for youth such as bars andinternet ‘hook-up’ sites, while others turn to criminal behavior.• In a 2004 survey of SMYAL youth, 30.6% of our LGBTQ youth reported thatthey had been jailed in their lifetime. 12• The 2004 Focus Group Report created by SMYAL and Metro Teen AIDS foundthat many young men of color who have sex with men lie about their ageonline and in bars. They reported doing so because there is “a lack of placesto hang out that are gay-friendly.” 13• SMYAL is the only LGBTQ youth service agency in the city. Our hours do notextend past 8 P.M. and our space is extremely limited. Many youth do notaccess services at other organizations for fear of being harassed orvictimized. Many of our youth have no safe space other than SMYAL. This lackof safe space is especially problematic after we close for the evening.Safe ‘Out-of-School Time’:• D.C. must designate funding specifically for after-school, late night andweekend programs for LGBTQ youth, especially those of color.• D.C. must work with private and community-based organizations to provideappropriate spaces in DCPS buildings, community recreation centers, andother D.C. government buildings for safe space activities for LGBTQ youth.job and life skillsafter-school time6Under-funded and Inadequate Mental Health, Substance AbusePrevention and Treatment Services:The devastating impact of harassment and anti-LGBT sentiment leads manyLGBTQ youth to attempt escaping the painful reality of their lives throughdesperate means.• In a 2001 study, one in ten LGBT youths attempted suicide within the previousyear. Of these, 34% reported needing emergency care after the attempt.14 Incontrast, the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health found thatonly 4% of all youth reported attempting suicide in the previous year.15• A 2003 study of all Massachusettshigh school students shows that LGBTyouth are more likely than theirheterosexual peers to report smokingtobacco recently (48% vs. 19%) andon a daily basis (23% vs. 6%), alcoholuse (60% vs. 45%), binge drinking(44% vs. 29%), drug use (49% vs. 29%)and lifetime drug use (73% vs. 46%).16Current funding for this vulnerablepopulation is extremely limited.Unsafe Sexual Behavior:Without the support and education they need to make healthy decisions, manyLGBT young people engage in unsafe sexual behavior, putting them at risk forHIV and other STD infection.• A national study of LGBT college students conducted by Western KentuckyUniversity over the 2001-2002 academic year found that only one in three(35.6%) gay, bisexual, and transgender men in college reported using acondom during their most recent sexual encounter.17• While many assume that lesbian and bisexual young women are at decreasedrisk for HIV, STDs, and pregnancy, a 1999 study finds the opposite is true:lesbian and bisexual young women report higher rates of pregnancy thantheir heterosexual peers (12% vs. 5.3%).18Increased Funding for Expert Mental Health, Substance Abuseand HIV Prevention and Treatment Services:• Ensure all Department of Mental Health Service Providers are trained toidentify and work with LGBTQ youth with mental health issues.• Identify available clinicians with expertise in working with LGBTQ youth andrefer LGBTQ youth to these specialists.• Provide funding and ensure availability of substance abuse prevention andtreatment programs specifically targeted for LGBTQ youth, including “clubdrugs” and crystal methamphetamine.• D.C. must dramatically expand HIV prevention, outreach, and counseling,testing, and referral funds specifically targeting LGBTQ youth 13-24 years oldwith specific focus on youth of color.mental health, susbtance abuse & HIVOne in ten LGBT youthsattempted suicide withinthe previous year.(Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 2001)7Violence and Hate Crimes in the Community:LGBTQ youth are often targeted for violence by complete strangers due to theirattackers’ bias against LGBT individuals. Many LGBTQ youth and adults do notreport these hate crimes committed against them because of the stigma theyfeel for being LGBTQ. For this reason, the reported numbers of hate crimesreleased by the FBI are likely to be lower than the numbers of crimes actuallycommitted. Even so, the statistics are alarming.• In 2004, 49 hate or bias crimes were reported in the District of Columbia.More than half (29) of these crimes werebased on the victim’s sexualorientation.16• The DIstrict currently treats hate crimesagainst lesbian, gay, and bisexualindividuals along with crimes againsttransgender individuals as crimes basedon the victim’s sexual orientation. Thismethod does not record the number ofcrimes specifically based on the victim’sgender identity, and so preventsaccurate reports of hate crimes againsttransgender individuals.Domestic and RelationshipAbuse:• A 2003 survey shows that 30% ofsexual minority youth reporteddating violence, compared toonly 9% of other students, and41% reported nonconsensualsexual contact, compared toonly 8% of other students.17• Young lesbians and bisexualwomen are at even greater riskfor experiencing sexual violence and rape. A 2003 study released by the SanFrancisco Department of Public Health found that these women were morelikely than their heterosexual counterparts to report being forced to havesex (50% vs. 23%) and being threatened with force to have sex (55% vs.25%).18Safe and Affirming Communities:• D.C. must track hate crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identityseparately.• Mandate LGBTQ youth cultural competency training for all DC Police Officers.• Address violence participation and victimization of LGBTQ youth throughcrime prevention strategies.• D.C. must fund domestic and relationship violence prevention and supportprograms specifically for LGBTQ youth, especially those of color.Young lesbians and bisexualwomen are more likely thantheir heterosexual peers toreport being forced to havesex (50% vs. 23%).(Journal of Lesbian Studies, 2003)violence and victimizationMore than half of thehate crimes reportedin 2004 in the Districtwere motivated bythe victim’s sexualorientation.(FBI, 2004)8No Services for LGBTQ Latino/a Youth:No survey has yet assessed the needs of Latino/a LGBTQ youth living in theDistrict, but the large size and continued growth of the city’s Latino/apopulation suggests that there are many Latino/a LGBTQ youth living, going toschool, and working here. Currently, no programs which specifically serve thispopulation exist in our city.  SMYAL is small and limited in our capacity, whichhas prevented us from developing a program specifically for Latino/a youth.SMYAL asked the community groupLatin@s En Accion (Latinos/as EnAccion) to partner with us todevelop these specificrecommendations that could beimplemented to help identify andprovide critical services to Latino/aLGBTQ youth.SMYAL wishes to thank RubyCorado and Latin@s En Accion fortheir assistance with developingthis section of the report. Culturally Competent Services for LGBTQ Latino/a Youth:• D.C. must fund the creation of culturally competent safe spaces for LGBTQLatino/a Youth where they can receive services including preventive healthcare, emergency/transitional housing, substance abuse care, educationassistance, and support for other issues related to sexual orientation orgender  identity. This site must serve Latino/a LGBTQ youth regardless ofeconomic and immigration status and have a staff fluent in Spanish.• D.C. must fund the development of programs for LGBTQ Latino/a youth thatfocus on personal growth and leadership skills, preparing them to becomefuture community leaders, to advocate for their own needs, and to workwithin their community to change negative attitudes toward LGBTQ Latino/aindividuals.• D.C. must fund cultural and educational programs for Latino/a LGBTQ youth,their parents, peers, and their community which foster acceptance of theseyouth and help them identify with the entire Latino/a community.About Latin@s En Accion:The Mission of Latin@s En Accion is to promote social, cultural, educational andcommunity interests within the Latin@ GLBT community by developing coop-eration and mutual understanding, by creating positive role models within theLatin@ GLBT Community, demonstrating that our sexual orientation is a sourceof pride and respect, and opposing existing discrimination, prejudices and ste-reotypes while developing and strengthening ties between persons of oursexual orientation and the rest of our community.Latino/a LGBTQ youthNo survey has yet assessedthe needs of Latino/a LGBTQyouth living in the District,and, currently, no pro-grams which specificallyserve this population existin our city.9An Invisible Population:In this document, we outline several action steps that pertain specifically to theproblems facing transgender youth, especially transgender youth of color, inthe District of Columbia. We include transgender youth with lesbian, gay, andbisexual youth in many other recommendations. Although they may be relatedto LGB issues, many of the issuestransgender youth face are specific totheir transgender status. For this reason,we have included a section to addressthe specific needs of this population.Little data exists about the specificproblems facing transgender youth dueto the tendency of researchers to groupthem with lesbian, gay, and bisexualyouth, so we have included data abouttransgender adults in the District ofColumbia that is relevant to youth issues.• In GLSEN’s National School ClimateSurvey, more than three out of four transgender middle and high schoolstudents (78.8%) reported feeling unsafe in school due to their genderexpression. 23.8% of the transgender students reported being physicallyharassed due to their gender expression.22• The Washington Transgender Needs Assessment Survey (WTNAS), released in2000, evidences the problems many transgender adults face in findingemployment (42% reported being unemployed), learning job skills (40% hadnot finished high school), and dealing with STDS and HIV (32% of male-to-female transgender individuals reported being HIV positive). In furtherexamining the HIV infection rate, researchers found that 25% of thetransgender women did not realize unprotected sexual contact carried anyrisks.23Jobs and Life Skills for Transgender Youth:• D.C. must ensure appropriate regulations for the recent “Human RightsClarification Act” are created to enforce employment protection fortransgender youth.• D.C. must fund job training and referral programs specifically developed fortransgender youth, especially those of color.Safe Spaces for Transgender Youth:• D.C. must require and provide transgender youth cultural competencytraining and harassment and bullying prevention training for all DCPS facultyand staff.• D.C. must provide private rooms and bathrooms in emergency andtransitional housing for transgender youth so they do not need to shareaccommodations with people of either gender.• D.C. must track hate crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identityseparately.transgender youth78.8% of transgendermiddle and high schoolstudents report feel-ing unsafe in schooldue to their genderexpression.(GLSEN, 2004)10The Sexual Minority Youth Assistance League (SMYAL) is the only Washington, DCmetro area service organization solely dedicated to supporting lesbian, gay,bisexual, transgender, intersex, and questioning (LGBTIQ) youth. Founded in 1984,SMYAL is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization.Our mission is to promote and support self-confident, healthy, productive livesfor LGBTIQ youth as they journey from adolescence into adulthood. To fulfill ourmission, we focus our commitment and energy on five focus areas: (1) Life Skills &Leadership Development, (2) Counseling & Support, (3) Health & WellnessEducation, (4) Safe Social Activities, and (5) Community Outreach & Education.SMYAL was founded in 1984 by a group of community activists in response to thehospitalization and incarceration of “cross-dressing” youth in St. Elizabeth’sPsychiatric Hospital.  SMYAL began as a weekend support group, expanded intoan after-school program, and in 1997 purchased two adjacent row houses onCapital Hill that serve as our administrative offices and Youth Center.410 7th Street, SE, Washington, DC 20003[p] 202.546.5940 [f] 202.544.1306SMYAL.orgUW/CFC #8142referencesabout SMYAL1 Kosciw, J.G.
