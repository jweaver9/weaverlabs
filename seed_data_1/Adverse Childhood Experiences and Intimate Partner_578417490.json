Childhood adversity has been linked to numerous health and mental health concerns in adulthood (Felitti et al., 1998). Among the many outcomes associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), victimization and perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) remains a public health crisis. Research has found that those identifying as gender minority individuals are disproportionately impacted by IPV (Messinger, 2017; Peitzmeier et al., 2020). Further, gender minority individuals experience equivalent, if not higher, rates of ACEs when compared to their cisgender counterparts (Baams, 2018; Juárez-Chávez et al., 2018; Schnarrs et al., 2019; Tobin & Delaney, 2019). While many factors contribute to the pathway from ACEs to IPV, the role of internalized transphobia (IT) in this relation is poorly understood. However, previous research has underscored the role of internalized shame in relation to both ACEs and IPV (Rood et al., 2017; Thaggard & Montayre, 2019; Thomson & Jaque, 2018b). Internalized transphobia may therefore serve as a mediator in the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence. Using a cross-sectional quantitative single administration survey design, this research aimed to better understand the relation between ACEs, IT, and IPV in adults identifying as gender minorities. This study used a mediated regression model to discern if internalized transphobia mediated the relationship between childhood adversity and intimate partner violence. Findings from this research indicated that while internalized transphobia did not mediate the relationship between ACEs and IPV, IT was still predictive of IPV. Endorsement of ACEs also predicted endorsement of IPV.

Intimate partner violence is typically conceptualized within four domains of violence – sexual, psychological, stalking, and physical violence (Breiding et al., 2015; D’Inverno et al., 2019; National Coalition Against Domestic Violence [NCADV], 2020; Smith et al., 2018). Sexual IPV includes sexual coercion, unwanted sexual contact, being forced to penetrate another person, and rape (D’Inverno et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2018). Psychological violence includes coercive control and expressive aggression, such as humiliation tactics and insults.  Stalking behavior broadly consists of habitual threats and harassment that cause a victim to fear for their own safety and/or the safety of others close to them (NCADV, 2020). Stalking can include unwanted following or close physical proximity by the perpetrator, unwanted digital contact, such as phone calls, text messages, or emails, and unwanted gift giving. Finally, stalking may also include breaking into and entering a victim’s home or vehicle for the purpose of scaring the victim or ensuring the victim is aware the perpetrator has violated the victim’s space (Smith et al., 2018). Physical violence is comprised of actions that can cause physical injury, including being hit or kicked by a partner, pulled by the hair, choked or beaten, and harm inflicted by a gun, knife, or other weapon (D’Inverno, 2019; Smith et al., 2018).  Prevalence of IPV in Heterosexual Populations  2 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  In heterosexual populations, IPV has a high prevalence rate. National data indicate that approximately 11% of men and 25% of women have experienced some form of intimate partner violence that led to an IPV-related impact (Smith et al., 2018). Data gathered through the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) indicate that roughly 34% and 36% of male and female respondents, respectively, reported a history of experiencing any form of physical or sexual violence or stalking from an intimate partner (Smith et al., 2018).  Over one-third (34.2%) of male respondents on the NISVS endorsed a history of experiencing psychological aggression from an intimate partner.  Roughly 36% of female participants endorsed experiencing any form of psychological IPV and 30.6% reported a history of any form of coercive control. Over 29% of female NISVS respondents reported having been shoved, pushed, or slapped by an intimate partner (Smith et al., 2018). Across men and women, having a partner track their contacts and activities was the most frequently endorsed form of coercive control, with roughly a quarter of men (24.9%) and women (23.5%) endorsing this experience (Smith et al., 2018). A recent study conducted in Canada found that 34% of females and 35% of males in their sample endorsed experiencing high controlling behaviors from an intimate partner (Lysova et al., 2019).  Adverse Impacts of IPV The detrimental impact of intimate partner violence (IPV) is multifaceted, including occupational impairment (LeBlanc et al., 2014), sleep disturbances (Rauer et al., 2010), suicidal ideation (Wolford-Clevenger et al., 2016), depression, anxiety, substance use, and chronic mental illness (Coker et al., 2002). Research has also found that survivors of IPV experience posttraumatic stress symptoms, including situational avoidance, emotional numbing, and hypervigilance (D’Inverno et al., 2019; Lysova et al., 2019). Among cisgender females in higher 3 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  education, IPV victimization was found to be positively correlated with PTSD symptoms, academic disengagement, depression, and adverse academic impacts, such as switching majors (Wood et al., 2020). Additionally, researchers found that as severity of IPV victimization increased, so too did mental health symptoms and academic concerns (Wood et al., 2020). Among sexual minority individuals, shame associated with one’s sexual orientation and IPV victimization experiences contributed to low help-seeking and further victimization (Thaggard & Montayre, 2019). In addition to the psychological impacts of IPV victimization, many survivors also sustain physical injuries of varying degrees of severity. These physical injuries can often intensify subsequent psychological impacts (D’Inverno et al., 2019). Risk Factors for IPV  The high prevalence of IPV has led to increased analysis of risk factors for victimization. In their study, Keenan-Miller and colleagues (2007) found that adolescents who were at risk for intergenerational depression also demonstrated increased risk for severe IPV victimization in young adulthood. Additionally, the researchers found that youth social functioning partially mediated the relation between intergenerational depression risk and prospective risk for severe IPV. These findings demonstrate the need for targeted research on adolescent psychosocial functioning and romantic relationships as a pathway to adult experiences of IPV.   Studies examining IPV in adolescence and young adulthood have identified risk factors for perpetration, including family-of-origin violence (Edwards, et al., 2014), unskilled parenting (Capaldi & Clark, 1998), and substance use (Shorey et al., 2014). Research focusing specifically on cisgender heterosexual men has implicated masculine identity and gender role stress in the perpetration of relationship aggression (Cohn & Zeichner, 2006). In their study, Cohn and Zeichner (2006) found that cisgender heterosexual male participants that strictly adhered to 4 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  social norms of masculine identity evidenced increased aggressive behavior. Similarly, male gender role stress, defined as situational variables influencing presentation intensity of masculine identity, evidenced increased aggressive behavior.   Substance use is also related to the perpetration of IPV. In their 2011 daily diary study, Moore and colleagues found that on drinking days, participants were 2.19 and 3.64 times more likely to commit psychological and physical aggression, respectively, compared to nondrinking days (Moore et al., 2011). Further, male participants demonstrated 7.03 greater odds of committing psychological aggression towards their partners on drinking days, compared with a 1.60 odds ratio among female participants. These findings were replicated in a daily diary study assessing angry affect, marijuana use, and alcohol use in college females (Shorey et al., 2014). In addition to alcohol consumption increasing the odds for psychological and physical aggression perpetration, the researchers found that marijuana use increased the odds of committing psychological aggression (Shorey et al., 2014).  Finally, family functioning has been implicated as a risk factor for perpetration of IPV in cisgender heterosexual individuals. In their 2014 study, Edwards and colleagues found that witnessing or being a victim of violence in the home at an early age led to increased likelihood of IPV perpetration in adolescence and young adulthood. Further, the researchers found that those who experienced sexual or psychological child abuse evidenced hostile-dominant interpersonal problems (HDIP) that significantly predicted perpetration of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse in adolescence and young adulthood (Edwards et al., 2014). In a longitudinal study, researchers found that unskilled parenting practices in childhood predicted antisocial behavior in adolescence, which in turn predicted perpetration of intimate aggression in young adulthood (Capaldi & Clark, 1998). History of child abuse, alcohol and other substance use, and witnessing 5 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  domestic violence in the home similarly predicted IPV in the LGB population as in the cisgender heterosexual population (Craft & Serovich, 2005; Mason et al., 2016).  Of critical importance is the well-documented association between childhood exposure to violence in the home and subsequent intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization (Anderson & Kras, 2005; Jones et al., 2018; Messinger, 2017). Various perspectives have been offered to explicate this association, including social learning theory (Bandura, 1973; Kwong et al., 2003; Messinger et al., 2021), intergenerational transmission of violence (Ehrensaft et al., 2003), and developmental victimology (Finkelhor, 1995). This pathway equifinality underscores the necessity of more nuanced examinations of IPV risk factors across the lifespan.   Despite significant strides in the intervention and prevention methods literature, intimate partner violence continues to be a devastating public health problem that negatively impacts survivors and those around them. Individuals who have experienced violence victimization in their intimate partnership are at a significantly greater risk of intimate partner homicide (NCADV, 2020; Vatnar et al., 2017). Further, those in intimate partnerships in which children are part of the family system may inadvertently perpetuate abuse cycles through the intergenerational transmission of trauma (Kwong et al., 2003). Many individuals who witness violence in the home early and often in childhood come to not only expect, but also accept, violence victimization as a normative facet of adult partnerships (Lee et al., 2016).  Extant research suggests a high prevalence of intimate partner violence victimization, with over a third of both natal females and natal males reporting a history of physical or sexual violence victimization from a partner (Smith et al., 2018). The aftermath of relationship violence can create numerous mental and physical health concerns, including depression and anxiety, low self-esteem and shame, PTSD, and substance use (Coker et al., 2002; Thaggard & Montayre, 6 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  2019; Wolford-Clevenger et al., 2016). Additionally, survivors often experience a variety of functional impairments, such as poor sleep and occupational and academic impairments (LeBlanc et al., 2014; Rauer et al., 2010; Wood et al., 2020). The existing body of literature suggests many factors can contribute to an individual’s overall risk for violence victimization and perpetration in intimate partnerships (Moore et al., 2011; Shorey et al., 2014). Among the many constructs that have been analyzed thus far, family-of-origin violence and personal identity variables appear to play a key role in understanding an individual’s risk for experiencing intimate partner violence across the lifespan (Cohn & Zeichner, 2006; Craft & Serovich, 2005; Edwards et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2018; Mason et al., 2016).  IPV in Gender Minority Communities   Most previous literature on IPV has focused on the victimization experiences of heterosexual women and men. There is also a growing scholarship on the IPV experiences of sexual minority individuals. However, there is a paucity of research exclusively on the IPV considerations for gender minority individuals. Gender minority individuals are those who identify with a gender different from their sex assigned at birth. Those who identify as gender minorities may describe their gender as transgender, genderqueer, agender, or gender fluid, among others. Many researchers have combined sexual and gender minority IPV survivors into a single group, often referring to trans-identifying individuals under the umbrella term of sexual minority individuals or LBGT (Smith et al., 2016). While this categorization has aided LGBT IPV research, the inclusion of gender minority individuals in sexual minority research may obfuscate our clinical understanding of potentially unique transgender IPV experiences.  Unique IPV Features in Gender Minority Populations  7 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS   Some forms of IPV in GM relationships mirror those found in cisgender populations. There are, however, several forms of IPV distinct to GM populations. Psychological IPV includes a wide range of abusive behaviors, including interpersonal isolation, monitoring and stalking, threats, and financial control (Messinger, 2017). For gender minority individuals, financial abuse can also include control of a partner’s access to trans-affirming medical care (Brown & Pantalone, 2011; Cook-Daniels, 2015; Quinn, 2020). Additionally, abusers may force a partner to remain closeted in their gender identity or may forcefully out their partner as transgender (Cook-Daniels, 2015; Woulfe & Goodman, 2018). Verbal slurs, particularly those related to one’s gender identity, are also very common (Brown & Pantalone, 2011).  If a partner in the dyad has children, the abuser may use the children to manipulate, intimidate, and control their gender minority partner (Messinger, 2017). The abuser may threaten to harm the children or take the children away. Further, abusers may tell their GM partners that they are inadequate parents because of their gender identity (Messinger, 2017). Finally, abusers may engage in identity abuse in an attempt to control their partners by shaming them for their various minoritized identities, including race, ability status, age, and immigration and HIV status (Woulfe & Goodman, 2018). Identity abuse may also include attempts by the abuser to isolate their partner from the LGBTQ+ community (Woulfe & Goodman, 2018).   These tactics are often intended to foster shame in those being victimized by questioning the authenticity of an individual’s gender identity (Bornstein et al., 2006; Cook-Daniels, 2015). Many abusers will also highlight specific body parts with which the gender minority partner feels uncomfortable as a means to control and shame the partner. Further, this type of identity abuse often includes deadnaming and the use of incorrect, gender un-affirming pronouns in addition to imposed restrictions on gender presentation (Cook-Daniels, 2015; FORGE, 2013; Messinger, 8 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  2017; Woulfe & Goodman, 2018). Deadnaming occurs when an individual uses a GM person’s name given at birth and does not use their affirmed name (Freeman, 2018). A small body of research indicates that in addition to general physical victimization that has been identified across racial/ethnic, age, and sexual orientation groups, transgender individuals experience physical victimization that targets gendered body parts (Brown & Pantalone, 2011; Messinger, 2017; Quinn, 2020). This type of victimization is likely reflective of an abuser’s desires to humiliate and control their partner by denigrating the partner’s gender identity while physically harming them.   Quinn (2020) delineated five forms of transgender intimate partner violence (T-IPV) to explicate the nuances of identity violence in transgender intimate partnerships, including emotional, identity, isolation, financial, physical, and sexual abuse. While significant overlap exists between transgender and cisgender IPV, scholars contend that T-IPV is comprised of identity-specific forms of violence (Messinger, 2017; Quinn, 2020). Isolation abuse, for example, can include threats to out a partner as transgender as well as efforts to restrict a partner’s access to the gender minority community. Isolation abuse can also include justifications for isolation predicated on the partner’s fear of violence and transphobia outside of the relationship.  Identity abuse can include manipulation, denigration, and denial of a partner’s gender identity. Abusive partners may call into question the authenticity of their partner’s identity, exert control over how and when a partner transitions, and claim that no one will love their partner because of their gender minority identity (Quinn, 2020). Physical T-IPV can include targeting gendered body parts for physical violence and not allowing a partner to heal after transition-related surgeries and procedures. Sexual T-IPV may also target gendered body parts and can include eroticizing gendered body parts with which the partner is uncomfortable or dysphoric 9 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  (Quinn, 2020). As previously mentioned, financial abuse can include restriction to transition-related expenses and gender-affirming products. Forms of emotional abuse are most akin to cisgender heterosexual and cisgender sexual minority IPV and can include manipulation and blame, criticizing one’s partner, and name calling (Quinn, 2020). Estimated Prevalence of IPV in Gender Minority Populations  When considering rates of sexual violence in intimate relationships, transgender and gender nonconforming individuals evidence heightened rates of victimization. A recent study found that between 16% and 73% of gender minority individuals have experienced psychological IPV related to their T/GNC status (Messinger, 2017). When compared to cisgender individuals, gender minority individuals are 1.7 times more likely to experience any form of IPV victimization and are 2.2 times more likely to be physically victimized. Additionally, gender minority individuals are 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual victimization from an intimate partner when compared to cisgender individuals (Peitzmeier et al., 2020). An estimated 59% of transgender and gender nonconforming adolescents reported experiencing psychological intimate partner violence in the past year (Scottish Transgender Alliance, 2010). Approximately 57% of transmales and 79% of transfemales endorsed lifetime psychological IPV (Messinger, 2017; Pitts et al., 2006). Roughly 33% of gender minority individuals in the United States have endorsed a lifetime prevalence of sexual or physical IPV victimization (Keuroghlian et al., 2015; Messinger, 2017).  Global estimates for physical victimization are higher, with 43-46% of transgender and gender nonconforming adults endorsing lifetime prevalence of physical IPV (Nemoto et al., 2011). One study conducted in the United States reported the past year prevalence of sexual IPV among gender minority adolescents to be 61% (Dank et al., 2014; Messinger, 2017). Global 10 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  estimates range from 8% to 47% for intimate partner sexual violence, which includes behaviors ranging from rape to sexual coercion to sexual contact during substance-based incapacitation. It should be noted that forced substance use is yet another IPV tactic, and as such may complexify and multiply the severity and distress experienced by those who are victimized (Messinger, 2017). Further, the topography of sexual IPV enacted towards gender minority individuals underscores the nuances of gender identity abuse. Similar to the physical violence committed against gendered body parts, perpetrators will often engage in nonconsensual sexual contact with the gendered body parts of their partner as a means of sexual control and coercion (Brown & Pantalone, 2011; Cook-Daniels, 2015; FORGE, 2013). Traditional sex roles and gender norms also influence the presentation of sexual IPV, such that perpetrators will call into question the authenticity of their partner’s gender identity or argue that “real” women and men engage in “rough sex” as a means to justify sexual coercion (Bornstein et al., 2006; Cook-Daniels, 2015; Messinger, 2017).   Another unique facet of IPV committed against gender minority individuals is that transgender and gender nonconforming survivors often experience verbal, and sometimes physical and sexual, victimization in a public setting (Guadalupe-Diaz, 2019; Messinger, 2017). The outcomes of intimate partner violence committed against gender minority individuals are multiple and varied. Many survivors report injuries that impact daily functioning and lead to work and school absence (Messinger, 2017). One study found that nearly 30% of gender minority survivors endorsed missing school or work due to IPV victimization (Scottish Transgender Alliance, 2010). The number of gender minority individuals who experience severe physical injuries varies, with estimates ranging from 16 to 42% of T/GNC survivors (Pitts et al., 2006). Furthermore, fear and safety concerns are fairly common, with gender minority 11 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  individuals in both quantitative and qualitative studies endorsing fear in their intimate partnerships (Pitts et al., 2006; Quinn, 2020). Finally, a staggering 76% of transgender and gender nonconforming survivors endorsed mental health concerns associated with intimate partner violence (Scottish Transgender Alliance, 2010).   While previous work has elucidated nuances in LGBQ IPV, little attention has been paid to the experiences of gender minority survivors of IPV. The dearth of research on interpersonal dynamics among the gender minority population is reflective of the lack of resources available to gender minority victims and perpetrators (Edwards et al., 2015). This research therefore aimed to highlight the needs of the gender minority population and inform future policy and intervention work to improve psychological functioning and improve mental healthcare equity.  Adverse Childhood Experiences ACEs Overview  There is evidence that intimate partner violence and early childhood experiences are related. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are broadly conceptualized as exposure to potentially traumatizing events prior to the age of eighteen (Felitti et al., 1998). The original ACEs questionnaire assesses three forms of abuse in childhood and four forms of domestic dysfunction. Child abuse categories include physical, psychological, and contact sexual abuse. Dysfunction in the home is conceptualized as exposure to violence victimization of one’s mother or stepmother, substance use and abuse, criminal behavior, and mental illness (Felitti et al., 1998).   Prevalence of ACEs in General Population The original ACEs study found that over half (52.1%) of respondents endorsed experiencing at least one ACE prior to the age of eighteen, with the bulk (25.6%) of participants 12 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  endorsing exposure to substance use disorders (Felitti et al., 1998). The second most frequently endorsed ACE was contact sexual abuse, with 22.0% of participants endorsing a history of sexual violence in childhood. Recent data analyzed from the second wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) indicates that over 60% of respondents endorsed a history of exposure to adverse experiences in childhood (Brown et al., 2017). Among college-age participants, a recent study found that nearly one quarter (22%) had been exposed to parental substance use disorders, 16% had experienced childhood sexual abuse, and 23% reported being exposed to two or more ACEs (Forster et al., 2018). Adult respondents in a retrospective Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) study endorsed even higher rates of ACEs, with 61.6% of respondents endorsing experiencing at least one ACE (Merrick et al., 2018). Nearly one quarter (24.6%) of participants endorsed an ACEs of 3 or more. In this study, Merrick and colleagues (2018) found the highest rate of endorsement for emotional abuse (34.4%), followed by divorce or separation between parents (27.6%), and exposure to substance use disorders in the home (27.6%). Another study conducted with the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) employed a modified form of the ACE instrument (Crouch et al., 2019). In their analysis, Crouch and colleagues (2019) operationalized ACEs to include substance use disorders in the home, incarceration of a member of the home, death of a parent, parental divorce or separation, witnessing violence in the home, witnessing violence in one’s neighborhood, mental illness in the home, financial adversity, and racial/ethnic maltreatment. Across respondents, the most frequently endorsed ACE was financial hardship, with nearly one quarter (22.5%) of respondents indicating that they had experienced difficulty affording basic housing and/or food. Additionally, 13 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  over 20% of participants endorsed a history of parental divorce or separation (Crouch et al., 2019).  Among sexual minority individuals, prevalence of ACEs is even higher. A study conducted with LGBTQ+ youth found that 86% of respondents endorsed having experienced at least one ACE, with 43% of respondents endorsing experiencing four or more ACEs (Craig et al., 2020). This highly elevated percentage is concerning given the well-established link between experiencing four or more ACEs and the subsequent development of health risk behaviors and mental health concerns (Brown et al., 2017; Clements-Nolle et al., 2018; Dube et al., 2001; Felitti et al., 1998; Forster et al., 2018). In 2013, Andersen and Blosnich found significantly higher rates of endorsement of ACEs among sexual minority participants compared to heterosexual respondents. Those identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual reported significantly higher frequencies of mental illness in the home, physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, and substance use disorders in the home. Sexual minority respondents also endorsed significantly more exposure to domestic violence, as well as having a member of the home incarcerated and living with someone with mental illness. When compared to heterosexual respondents, bisexual participants reported significantly higher rates of parental divorce or separation. The comparison of parental divorce or separation between heterosexual respondents and those identifying as gay and lesbian was nonsignificant (Andersen & Blosnich, 2013).   Negative Impacts of ACEs Experiences The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study (ACE) sought to explicate not only the prevalence of childhood trauma across the United States, but also clarify the relation between experiences of trauma in childhood and subsequent health behaviors in adulthood (Felitti et al., 1998). The ACE measure is widely implemented in research assessing retrospective reports of 14 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  adversity in childhood and has proffered robust findings regarding the deleterious sequelae of mental and physical health consequences for survivors of childhood trauma (Felitti et al., 1998; van der Kolk, 2014).  Results from adverse childhood experiences studies have found that those who endorse experiencing childhood trauma are significantly more likely to suffer from serious health concerns, including obesity, sexually transmitted infections (STI), cancer, heart diseases, organ failure, and skeletal fractures (Brown et al., 2017; Felitti et al., 1998). Further, those with a history of childhood trauma also evidence disproportionate risk of substance use disorders, depression, and suicidality (Clements-Nolle et al., 2018; Felitti et al., 1998; Forster et al., 2018). These findings are particularly pronounced among sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals, such that those who identify as LGBTQ+ evidence disproportionate risk for traumatic victimization in childhood and subsequent psychosocial deficits across the lifespan (Andersen & Blosnich, 2013; Austin et al., 2016; Clements-Nolle et al., 2018; Schnarrs et al., 2019; Zou & Andersen, 2015). In 2015, Austin and colleagues reported that the higher prevalence of ACEs among sexual minority respondents may contribute to this population’s elevated risk for poor health behaviors and health outcomes. Among sexual minority respondents, this study found that endorsement of a history of ACEs was significantly associated with depressive symptoms, asthma, disability status, sexual risk behaviors related to HIV, limitations in physical activity due to health concerns, and poor overall mental wellness (Austin et al., 2016)   ACEs in the Gender Minority Population Unique ACEs Among Gender Minority Individuals  15 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  Recent research has found that transgender and gender nonconforming individuals experience equivalent, if not higher rates of adverse childhood experiences compared to their cisgender counterparts (Baams, 2018; Juárez-Chávez et al., 2018; Schnarrs et al., 2019; Tobin & Delaney, 2019). These findings underscore the importance of research analyzing adverse childhood experiences in gender minority populations. Among studies conducted with gender minority participants, research has found that those identifying as transgender are significantly more likely to endorse polyvictimization in childhood and physical and/or psychological childhood abuse compared to cisgender sexual minority and cisgender heterosexual peers (Baams, 2018). Additionally, childhood abuse among those identifying as gender minorities is significantly associated with adult diagnosis of PTSD (Reisner et al., 2016) and endorsement of past-year drug abuse (Scheim et al., 2017). Finally, abuse in childhood has been found to be significantly predictive of suicide attempts, self-harm, and risky sexual behavior among transgender and gender nonconforming individuals (Fernández-Rouco et al., 2016; Taliaferro et al., 2018; Tobin & Delaney, 2019). In a retrospective self-report study conducted with transgender individuals assigned male at birth (AMAB), participants were asked to reflect on their experiences of potentially traumatic events (PTEs), including various forms of childhood abuse, family violence, and intimate partner violence (Shipherd et al., 2011). Participants in this study also indicated the frequency of victimization due to their transgender status. Among those endorsing a history of physical punishment in childhood, nearly half (46%) reported that they suffered this violence victimization because of their transgender status. Almost 60% of respondents endorsed a history of witnessing family violence in childhood related to their transgender status. For those 16 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  endorsing a history of childhood sexual abuse, 27% of participants indicated that they were sexually abused because they are transgender (Shipherd et al., 2011).  A recent qualitative study conducted with transgender women identified themes of gender nonconformity and strict gender stereotypes related to violence in the home and within one’s family of origin (Juarez-Chavez et al., 2018). Transwomen in this study reported being physically and verbally abused by family members due to perceptions that they were effeminate. Rates of childhood sexual violence were similar to Shipherd and colleagues’ (2011) findings, with roughly one-third of participants endorsing a history of sexual violence prior to age eighteen (Juarez-Chavez et al., 2018). The majority of transwomen interviewed in this study reported that sexual violence occurred in the school setting and was typically perpetrated by male students several years their senior. One participant endorsed being sexually abused by a relative in the home in addition to sexual victimization at school. Most participants also identified experiencing homophobic bullying and slurs prior to or during the attack. Participants further endorsed a pattern of forced silencing by perpetrators related to perceived sexual orientation (Juarez-Chavez et al., 2018).  Other research has underscored the role of gender nonconformity in childhood victimization (Baams, 2018; Grossman et al., 2005; Tobin & Delaney, 2019). A recent cross-sectional quantitative study found that for those identifying as transgender or gender nonconforming, higher degrees of gender nonconformity significantly predicted the likelihood of experiencing each form of childhood adversity assessed in the study (Baams, 2018). This study employed a modified ACES to analyze childhood experiences of psychological abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse by a nonfamily member, sexual abuse by a family member, witnessing intimate partner violence in the home, having a parent or caregiver in prison, and living with 17 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  someone who abused alcohol or drugs. These findings replicate those reported by Grossman and colleagues (2005). In their mixed-methods study, the research team found that higher levels of gender nonconformity in childhood prior to age thirteen was significantly associated with increased endorsement of both psychological and physical abuse.  Another recent quantitative study examined disparities in ACEs between cisgender sexual minority participants and those identifying as gender minorities (Schnarrs et al., 2019). Those endorsing gender minority status were more likely to report having been emotionally abused and/or neglected and physically neglected when compared to cisgender sexual minority respondents.  Prevalence of ACEs in the GM population As previously mentioned, roughly one-third of transgender participants have endorsed a history of sexual victimization in childhood (Juarez-Chavez et al., 2018; Shipherd et al., 2011). Other research has reported higher rates of contact sexual violence in childhood, with 55% of transgender and gender nonconforming respondents endorsing a history of sexual abuse (Gehring & Knudson, 2005). The average age of first sexual victimization was thirteen. Participants also endorsed high rates of other forms of abuse. Over three-quarters of respondents endorsed a history of verbal abuse, including being insulted (81%) and being yelled at by a parent or caregiver (77%). Additionally, over half of this sample endorsed experiences of childhood psychological abuse, with 55% endorsing being made to feel embarrassed by a parent or caregiver in front of other people. Fifty-eight percent of respondents endorsed being made to feel guilty by a parent or caregiver (Gehring & Knudson, 2005).  When compared to cisgender sexual minority individuals, transgender and gender nonconforming participants are more likely to endorse a history of physical neglect, emotional 18 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  neglect, and emotional abuse (Schnarrs et al., 2019). Additionally, gender minority participants in this study were more likely to endorse higher ACEs scores compared to cisgender sexual minority individuals. This finding is concerning given the already elevated number of ACEs endorsed by sexual minority individuals in previous research (Andersen & Blosnich, 2013; Austin et al., 2016). In a study analyzing HIV sexual risk among female-to-male transgender adults, half of the sample endorsed a history of sexual and/or physical abuse prior to age fifteen (Reisner et al., 2016b)  In 2018, Baams found that when compared to heterosexual respondents, those identifying as gender minority individuals were significantly more likely to report each form of childhood adversity, including sexual, physical, and psychological abuse, problematic substance use in the home, witnessing intimate partner violence in the home, and parental or guardian imprisonment. These findings underscore the pervasive nature of mental and emotional abuse among this population, such that transgender and gender nonconforming respondents were nearly three times as likely to endorse being psychologically abused compared to heterosexual participants.  Importantly, rates of polyvictimization have been found to be significantly higher among gender minority individuals when compared to cisgender individuals, both sexual minority participants and those identifying as heterosexual (Baams, 2018; Sterzing et al., 2017). Sterzing and colleagues (2017) found that adolescents endorsing gender minority status reported significantly higher rates of various types of victimization, including sexual violence, child maltreatment, and school-based bullying, among others. When compared to cisgender males, transfemales reported significantly more cyberbullying victimization and exposure to victimization. Transmales endorsed higher rates of property victimization, with nearly 73% of respondents endorsing past-year property damage. Genderqueer individuals assigned male at 19 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  birth (AMAB) evidenced significantly higher rates of past-year sexual violence and bias-motivated physical violence victimization. Genderqueer participants assigned female at birth (AFAB) evidenced significantly higher rates of child maltreatment and sexual victimization compared to cisgender male respondents. Finally, Sterzing and colleagues (2017) identified polyvictimization as endorsement of ten or more different past-year victimization experiences. Across identity groups, those endorsing gender minority status were significantly more likely to be identified as polyvictimized, with 63.4% of transfemales endorsing ten or more past-year victimization experiences. Nearly half of transmales (48.9%) and genderqueer AFAB (49.5%) were identified as polyvictimized. Finally, 71.5% of genderqueer AMAB were identified as polyvictimized.  Relationship of ACEs and IPV Pathways from ACEs to IPV have been identified, both for perpetration behaviors and victimization experiences, among samples in the United States and internationally (Afifi et al., 2017; Bellis et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2011). In a study assessing health-harming behaviors conducted with participants living in England, researchers found the prevalence of violence victimization and perpetration to be five times higher among those endorsing an ACES score of 4 or higher (Bellis et al., 2014). This study utilized a 11-item short ACE tool that separated items into nine distinct ACE categories. Scores on the short ACE ranged from 0 to 9 (Bellis et al., 2014). In the United States, rates of physical dating violence victimization and perpetration were significantly associated with ACEs. Individuals who endorsed a history of childhood sexual abuse, interparental violence, and parental mental illness were at a significantly greater risk of enacting or receiving physical dating violence. Further, risk of physical dating violence 20 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  victimization and perpetration were both significantly increased for those endorsing additional experiences of childhood adversity (Miller et al., 2011).  Other research has supported this association. Afifi and colleagues (2017) found an association between harsh physical punishment in childhood and intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization. Harsh physical punishment was operationalized as being pushed, shoved, slapped, hit, or grabbed by a parent or adult in the home prior to age 18. Harsh physical punishment in childhood was also found to be predictive of reciprocal IPV in adulthood (Afifi et al., 2017). Finally, harsh physical punishment in childhood was predictive of each form of childhood abuse, including sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, as well as physical and emotional neglect. This finding is significant as it underscores the vast range of childhood adversities found to increase one’s risk of IPV experiences in adulthood. Other research has reported natal sex-based differences in the contributions of ACEs to IPV perpetration (Brown et al., 2017). Specifically, the authors reported a direct association between sexual abuse and IPV perpetration among natal males. Among natal women, childhood neglect, physical abuse, and psychological abuse significantly predicted IPV perpetration in adulthood. In their full mediation model, only childhood sexual abuse demonstrated significance in predicting intimate partner violence perpetration among men. There were no statistically significant predictors of intimate partner violence perpetration among the natal female sample (Brown et al., 2017).   Research conducted with pregnant women has also found an association between physical and sexual abuse in childhood and intimate partner violence victimization in adulthood (Barrios et al., 2015). Those who endorsed experiencing both sexual and physical abuse in childhood evidenced a 7.14 times higher risk of experiencing sexual or physical IPV across the lifespan. Further, those endorsing both physical and sexual abuse in childhood were at a 3.33 21 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  times increased risk of experiencing past-year sexual or physical intimate partner violence (Barrios et al., 2015). Among men, a recent meta-analysis found a significant association between different forms of childhood maltreatment and intimate partner violence in adulthood. This association was significant for perpetrators of IPV and survivors of relationship violence (Godbout et al., 2019).   Social learning theory has been employed as a foundational theory to contextualize the intergenerational transmission of violence victimization and perpetration within one’s family-of-origin (Messinger, 2017). In this frame, children are thought to be socialized into accepting violence as part of their lived experiences. For some children, this may lead to the perpetuation of violence in adulthood in the context of romantic relationships. Others may normalize violence in adulthood victimization. Legal scholars have provided support for this theory, indicating that individuals exposed to childhood adversity adopt perpetrator and victim identities in adulthood as a function of family-of-origin social learning (Anderson & Kras, 2005). Specifically, Anderson and Kras (2005) underscore the malleability of values and perceptions of normalcy in childhood. While children may internally experience distress related to their adverse experiences, patterns of family behavior can set a precedent of acceptance of violence in the home and a chaotic environment. As adults, these same individuals may rationalize and accept their experiences with violence given the modeling of violence they witnessed during childhood.  In a 2011 study conducted with gender minority adults, Shipherd and colleagues found that nearly 60% of those endorsing intimate partner violence victimization indicated that they had been victimized due to their transgender identity. Another study conducted with transgender adults reported similar findings (White Hughto et al., 2017), indicating that those who endorsed a history of exposure to family violence were more likely to report intimate partner violence 22 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  victimization in adulthood. Similarly, those endorsing a history of physical and verbal abuse from their family of origin were more likely to endorse experiencing physical or sexual IPV victimization. Finally, White Hughto and colleagues (2017) found that history of childhood sexual abuse predicted adult IPV victimization.   Another recent study conducted with female-assigned-at-birth sexual and gender minority individuals (FAB SGM) found support for the theory of intergenerational violence transmission stemming from one’s family-of-origin (Messinger et al., 2021). In their study, Messinger and colleagues (2021) found significant associations between various forms of childhood violence exposure (CVE) and adult physical, sexual, and psychological intimate partner violence victimization and perpetration. Based in social learning theory, the research team found a similar pattern of violence victimization and perpetration in gender minority individuals as has been previously found among cisgender people (Anderson & Kras, 2005; Messinger et al., 2021).  Specifically, physical abuse and verbal maltreatment were both found to be independently predictive of physical and psychological IPV perpetration and victimization. Verbal maltreatment and physical abuse were also found to predict sexual IPV victimization. Childhood sexual abuse was found to predict each form of IPV perpetration and victimization aside from psychological IPV perpetration. Witnessing IPV between parents during childhood was also significantly predictive of each form of IPV, with the exception of sexual IPV victimization. Further, witnessing sibling abuse by a parent was significantly associated with each form of IPV aside from physical victimization and perpetration (Messinger et al., 2021). Interestingly, the research team found a mismatch in intergenerational transmission of typologies of violence, such that childhood physical abuse was more significantly associated with psychological IPV perpetration and victimization than physical perpetration and victimization. 23 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  The cumulative effect of childhood violence exposure was particularly pronounced as well. Participants reporting higher numbers of childhood violence exposures evidenced incrementally increasing risk of endorsing each form of IPV perpetration and victimization (Messinger et al., 2021).  Internalized Transphobia Internalized Transphobia- Overview Definition   In addition to the external stressors, discrimination, and violence victimization suffered by individuals identifying as gender minorities, those with diverse gender identities often must also contend with internalized shame related to their gender identities. Internalized transphobia (IT) is broadly defined as the process by which an individual incorporates discriminatory and prejudiced views regarding their gender identity into their own self-concept (Bockting et al., 2020; McLean, 2021). IT can include the adoption of transphobic beliefs about the self and can also propagate feelings of shame and low self-worth, along with a host of negative mental health consequences (Cronin et al., 2019; McLean, 2021; Staples et al., 2018). IT stems from overarching cultural cissexism that denigrates the identities of GM individuals. The systemic nature of internalized transphobia permeates multiple spheres of existence, meaning that individuals who experience IT often suffer external marginalization and subsequent devaluing of the self across contexts. The internalization of transphobic attitudes negatively impacts mental and physical health as well as overall quality of life, work outcomes, and interpersonal relationships (Lee et al., 2020; Mizock et al., 2017; Rood et al., 2017; Testa et al., 2017).  Adverse impacts of IT 24 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS   Internalized transphobia has been linked to numerous adverse impacts across multiple domains of functioning, including occupational impairment (Mizock & Mueser, 2014; Mizock et al., 2018; Mizock et al., 2017; Scandurra & Bochicchio, 2018), depression (Lee et al., 2020), maladaptive coping (Ashraf & Khan, 2019), and social and interpersonal concerns (Cronin et al., 2019; Rood et al., 2017). Further, extant research has found links between IT and disordered eating behavior (Parker & Harriger, 2020; Uniacke et al., 2021) as well as nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors (NSSIB), suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts (Kota et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Staples et al., 2018; Testa et al., 2017).   Gender minority individuals experience numerous barriers in the workplace related to their gender identities, including intersectional discrimination, gender policing and lack of inclusive workplace policies, and internalized transphobia (Mizock et al., 2018). A recent qualitative study conducted in 2018 with transgender and gender nonconforming adults employed thematic coding to analyze the role of various minority stressors in the workplace. Scandurra and Bochicchio (2018) found that experiences of internalized transphobia predominated the work sphere. Participants in the study reported that experiencing IT led to identity concealment in the workplace as well as conformity to gender role expectations. Participants endorsed internalizing gendered stereotypes and expectations to the extent of hypermasculine and hyperfeminine self-presentations that felt incongruent with their sense of self. Across participants, many reported feeling an internal pressure to reject and conceal their transgender or gender nonconforming identity due to perceptions that they would not be accepted by others. Many individuals in the study reported intense feelings of distress and discomfort, not only with concealing their gender minority identities, but also with their identities themselves (Scandurra & Bochicchio, 2018).  25 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  In 2014, Mizock and Mueser reported similar findings in a quantitative analysis of internalized transphobia, coping, and employment among transgender and gender nonconforming participants. Contrary to their hypotheses, Mizock and Mueser (2014) found that employed participants reported higher rates of IT compared to unemployed respondents. The authors postulated that those who endorsed being employed experienced higher rates of IT due to daily exposures to external transphobia in the workplace. The research team also found that the utilization of coping strategies was related to lower levels of internalized transphobia. Experiences of IT in the workplace can also lead to decreased engagement in work-related activities (Mizock et al., 2017). Internalized transphobia has also been found to be predictive of depressive symptoms (Ashraf & Khan, 2019; Lee et al., 2020). In a study conducted with GM participants in South Korea, researchers utilized a Korean-translated version of the Gender Minority Stress and Resilience measure (GMSR) to assess the relation between IT and mental health outcomes (Lee et al., 2020). The research team found IT significantly and positively predicted mental health sequelae, such that those endorsing higher degrees of IT also endorsed higher rates of depressive symptoms. Additionally, those endorsing higher degrees of IT reported significantly more suicidal ideation and history of suicide attempts (Lee et al., 2020). Other research employing the minority stress framework has supported this finding (Kota et al., 2020; Staples et al., 2018; Testa et al., 2017). In 2018, Staples and colleagues found that internalized transnegativity operated as both a moderator and mediator in the relation between distal gender minority stressors and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior and suicidal ideation. Using the GMSR, Testa and colleagues (2017) conducted a path analysis to understand the relation between distal gender minority stress, IT, 26 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  and suicidality. The research team reported significance in two of their models, such that IT mediated the relation between victimization, rejection, and non-affirmation and suicidal ideation. The second model demonstrated that IT was predictive of suicidal ideation through interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPTS) factors (Testa et al., 2017). Finally, using the Transgender Identity Survey (TIS) to assess IT, Perez-Brumer and colleagues (2015) found that elevated scores on the TIS were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of suicide attempts across the lifespan.   A recent international study conducted in Pakistan in 2019 assessed the mediating role of coping strategies in the relation between internalized transphobia and common mental health disorders, including somatic concerns, anxiety, and depression, as well as low frustration tolerance (Ashraf & Khan, 2019). The research team found that internalized transphobia was predictive of avoidant coping and each of the abovementioned mental health concerns. Similarly, in the qualitative component of their two-part study, Mizock and Mueser (2014) found that many participants endorsed utilizing disengagement coping as a way of avoiding difficult emotions surrounding internalized and external transphobia. Additionally, other work has posited that maladaptive coping strategies can lead to self-stigma, such as internalized transphobia (Mizock et al., 2017). In the face of workplace transphobia, participants endorsed maladaptive coping strategies that provided short-term relief from a transphobic work environment. However, these strategies can ultimately contribute to longer-term mental health concerns. Participants in Mizock and Mueser’s study (2014) endorsed using disengagement coping by avoiding interpersonal relationships due to fear of rejection related to their gender minority status. These individuals reported that internalized transphobia as well as societal transphobia contributed to their interpersonal avoidance. Theorists have also posited that interpersonal 27 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  rejection during transition can lead to greater internalized transphobia, which can in turn contribute to greater interpersonal isolation and alienation (McLean, 2021). Cronin and colleagues (2019) have postulated that secure attachment can serve as a safeguard against the impact of IT on mental health concerns, such that those who demonstrate secure attachment are better able to recognize and decrease the intensity of IT cognitions. In their study, Cronin and colleagues (2019) found IT to be positively associated with both attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety. IT was independently predictive of decreased life satisfaction. The interaction between IT and attachment avoidance, as well as the interaction between IT and attachment anxiety, were also significantly associated with decreased life satisfaction (Cronin et al., 2019). While individuals in transition may access support from other gender minority people, the longevity of relationships pre-transition is often compromised and can contribute to greater internalized transphobia. Recent research suggests that while social connectedness is significantly and positively associated with self-esteem among GM adults, the strength of the association between IT and low self-esteem remains (Austin & Goodman, 2017). It appears that social support does not provide a viable buffer against the insidious nature of internalized transphobia. Further, recent research has found that social collective action strengthened the relation between IT and psychological distress (Breslow et al., 2015). Finally, social messages from the larger cisnormative society have been found to contribute to elevated levels of IT. Participants in a recent qualitative study reported feelings of shame regarding their gender minority identity and body image as well as expectations for victimization and delayed transition (Rood et al., 2017). 28 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS   Research has found that those identifying as GM evidence elevated rates of disordered eating when compared to cisgender peers (Parker & Harriger, 2020; Uniacke et al., 2021). In one study, over half of participants described a lifetime history of disordered eating behaviors (Uniacke et al., 2021). Further, the majority of participants endorsed past-year elevated weight and shape concerns tied to self-concept and approximately 60% of respondents endorsed past-year restriction eating behaviors related to shape concerns. The research team also found that as internalized transphobia increased, so too did the risk of disordered eating behaviors (Uniacke et al., 2021). Those who endorsed higher transgender congruence, defined as external alignment between one’s gender identity and appearance, demonstrated lower levels of eating pathology. Those with low transgender congruence may therefore exhibit increased body dissatisfaction and internalized transphobia that contribute to increased risk of eating pathology (Parker & Harriger, 2020). Internalized Transphobia, ACEs, and IPV  Given the association between ACEs and IPV, as well as IT and IPV, it stands to reason that a relation among all three variables exists. Within the general population, research has supported the association between childhood adversity and violence victimization in adulthood (Messinger et al., 2021; Miller et al., 2011). Additionally, research has supported the role of internalized shame in IPV and ACEs (Scheer et al., 2019; Thomson & Jaque, 2018b). Individuals identifying as GM experience unique stressors related to their gender identity, often leading to internalized transphobia (Cronin et al., 2019; McLean, 2021; Staples et al., 2018). Understanding the relation between adverse childhood experiences and internalized transphobia is critical in illuminating pathways that contribute to mental health concerns among an already highly minoritized and at-risk population. Recent research has indicated a significant relation between 29 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  internalized stigma and childhood adversity. Among women living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), participants reported an average ACES score of 4.2 out of 10 (Cuca et al., 2019). Over half (58.3%) of participants reported experiencing four or more ACEs. The research team also employed a lifetime trauma instrument and found that 97.1% of respondents endorsed experiencing any traumatic event from childhood to adulthood. Cuca and colleagues (2019) found a statistically significant association between lifetime trauma exposure and internalized HIV stigma. Four transgender and intersex women were included in the study with a sample size of 104. Another recent study conducted with GM youth found that family-based emotional neglect and internalized sexual orientation and gender identity self-stigma significantly predicted past 6-month suicidality (Austin et al., 2020).  Further, a recent physical health study reported a significant positive association between total ACEs and internalized weight stigma in women with overweight/obesity, such that women who endorsed a higher number of ACEs also reported more internalized weight stigma (Keirns et al., 2021). Across ACEs typologies, abuse-type ACEs were significantly predictive of internalized weight stigma. Self-reports of internalized shame were significantly elevated among pre-professional and professional dancers with higher ACES scores (Thomson & Jaque, 2018b). Participants in the high internalized shame group with higher ACES scores endorsed significantly more experiences of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse as well as emotional neglect. When compared to the low internalized shame category, those with higher levels of internalized shame also demonstrated clinical degrees of low self-esteem and anxiety. The authors identified significance in their causal pathway model, demonstrating that ACEs exhibited a direct effect on internalized shame in adulthood (Thomson & Jaque, 2018b). In another study of performing arts professionals, those with an ACES score of 4 or higher out of 10 total ACE 30 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  items were significantly more likely to endorse higher levels of internalized shame (Thomson & Jaque, 2018a).   Thus, it appears that experiences of childhood adversity may lead to various forms of internalized stigma, which can then contribute to myriad health complications, mental health concerns, and interpersonal dysfunction. This relation may be especially heightened for ACEs that are typically imbued with shame. Individuals who have experienced sexual abuse, verbal victimization, and emotional or psychological abuse may demonstrate an elevated risk of internalized shame, both generally and as it pertains to various minoritized identities. Therefore, among gender minority individuals, a history of shame-inducing ACEs likely contributes to elevated internalized transphobia in adulthood.   Internalized transphobia can also contribute to subsequent interpersonal victimization. Such an association has been found among sexual minority women. In a vignette study assessing perceptions of psychological IPV, researchers found that higher endorsement of internalized sexual minority stigma predicted permissive attitudes towards perpetration of intimate partner psychological abuse (Islam, 2021). Badenes-Ribera and colleagues (2019) completed a meta-analysis on the existing literature analyzing internalized stigma and intimate partner violence among sexual minority individuals. The research team reported statistically significant positive correlations between internalized homophobia and both intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization. These findings held true for each form of IPV, including physical, sexual, and psychological violence (Badenes-Ribera et al., 2019). Across studies analyzed in the meta-analysis, participants endorsing higher rates of internalized homophobia also endorsed higher rates of IPV victimization and perpetration behaviors. The research team postulated that internalized homophobia may be differentially associated with intimate partner violence. For 31 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  some sexual minority respondents, internalization of negative perceptions regarding one’s sexual minority status may lead to the enactment of violence towards their partners. However, other sexual minority individuals with high internalized homophobia may adopt the perception that they are worthy of abuse in intimate relationships and therefore view intimate partner victimization as integral to their minoritized sexual orientation identity (Badenes-Ribera et al., 2019).   The abovementioned processes are likely also present in the intimate relationships of gender minority individuals. Given the similarities in minority stress pathways between sexual and gender minority individuals (Hendricks & Testa, 2012; Meyer, 2003), it is likely that gender minority individuals evidence similar internalizations of shame related to their minoritized identities. Experiences of internalized transphobia can then lead to violence in intimate relationships. Broadly, shame often contributes to an inclination to withdraw, seclude, and hide parts of oneself or one’s lived experiences. Identity-based shame similarly leads to concealment of various identities. Through this process, individuals who experience violence victimization in intimate partnerships often develop the perception that they are deserving of abuse due to their minoritized identities. Experiences of systemic discrimination, stigma, and violence contribute to the erroneous perception that one is worthy of IPV related to GM identity. Research is needed to better understand nuances in the relation between internalized stigma and intimate partner violence for GM individuals.  Critical Gap Most past literature examining IPV is focused on cisgender heterosexual individuals (Neal & Edwards, 2017; Rauer et al., 2010; Wolford-Clevenger et al., 2016). Empirical investigation with sexual minority groups has elucidated the health disparities and unique 32 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  experiences of the LGBQ population but is largely retrospective in nature and fails to distinguish between those identifying as sexual and gender minorities. Research on gender minority individuals has, for the most part, been subsumed under the umbrella of sexual minority literature. A critical gap is present in our ambiguous clinical understanding of the gender minority experience with IPV. Given the disproportionate rates of violence, adverse childhood experiences, victimization, and deleterious sequelae of psychosocial impairments in this community, it is vital that IPV research focus specifically on the lived experiences of GM individuals. This study therefore served to explicate the relation among adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), internalized transphobia (IT), and intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences among gender minority individuals. Findings from this work added to the existing body of literature on GM IPV and have the potential to inform future public health efforts for relationship violence prevention and intervention. Given the nuances of GM IPV, it is critical that prevention and intervention efforts are designed specifically for the needs of this highly underserved population. Of primary importance is a grounded understanding of not only typologies of gender minority intimate partner violence, but also an understanding of systemic factors that may contribute to both violence victimization and perpetration. The low help-seeking rates of GM survivors of interpersonal violence is well-established in the literature (Guadalupe-Diaz & Jasinski, 2016; Scheer et al., 2020). Expectations of stigma and discriminatory experiences within systems designed to help and provide care often prevent GM survivors from exiting violent relationships and seeking supportive services (Scheer et al., 2020).  Gender minority survivors may also exhibit a strong sense of shame, not only related to their experiences of victimization, but also their minoritized gender identity. This study intended 33 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  to provide insight into the role of IT in the relation between ACEs and IPV. By understanding how internalized transphobia can develop after childhood adversity, future research can explore methods of decreasing IT after experiencing trauma at a young age. Additionally, this work informs future intervention methodologies that target decreasing IT to promote adaptive interpersonal functioning within the context of intimate partnerships. Taken together, this research informs subsequent research and interventions that attenuate the sequelae of mental health outcomes and maladaptive interpersonal dynamics related to childhood trauma among gender minority individuals.     This study employed a quantitative cross-sectional single distribution survey design to assess the mediating role of internalized transphobia in the relation between adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence. It was hypothesized that: H1: There will be a significant, positive correlation between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and IPV experiences in adulthood.   This was tested first by a bivariate correlation analysis. The regression models also tested this hypothesis.   H2: There will be a significant, positive correlation between IT and IPV experiences in adulthood.  This was tested first by a bivariate correlation analysis. The regression models also tested this hypothesis.   H3: The relationship between adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence will be mediated by internalized transphobia.   This was tested with the regression models.   34 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  CHAPTER 2 Method Overview  This research aimed to explore the relationships among adverse childhood experiences, internalized transphobia, and intimate partner violence in gender minority adults. Previous research has provided insight into IPV dynamics in cisgender heterosexual individuals (Neal & Edwards, 2017; Rauer et al., 2010; Wolford-Clevenger et al., 2016) as well as those identifying as sexual minorities (Mason et al., 2016). Less is known about the nuances of intimate partner violence among GM individuals. Additionally, research has explored the relation between adverse childhood experiences and internalized shame (Scheer et al., 2019; Thomson & Jaque, 2018b) as well as childhood adversity to IPV (Messinger et al., 2021; Miller et al., 2011). The role of internalized shame in the relation between ACEs and IPV among those identifying as GM is less clear. This study therefore aimed to explicate this relation using a cross-sectional, single-distribution, quantitative survey design with instruments assessing childhood adversity, internalized transphobia, and intimate partner violence. It should be noted that language pertaining to identity is ever-evolving. As culture shifts and changes over time, so too does the language people use to describe their identities. The language used in this research is purposefully broad to be inclusive of a wide range of identifiers. The phrase gender minority, or GM, is used throughout this manuscript for this purpose. While the term gender minority is a current and widely used term at the time of writing, this author recognizes that cultural shifts in identity terms may render this phrase obsolete after publication.  Participants  35 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS   A G*Power analysis was completed to estimate the necessary number of participants for the study. G*Power is widely used in behavioral and social sciences research to calculate the necessary number of participants for various statistical procedures (Faul et al., 2007; Faul et al., 2009). Preliminary analyses using G*Power indicated a minimum sample size of 107 participants. This calculation was derived by using Cohen’s f2 = 0.15 for a medium effect size, a Power (1-β error probability) of .80, and an alpha level (α) of .05. An additional 18 participants were recruited to surpass the minimum number of participants required for a total n =125. Additional recruitment was conducted for the purpose of bolstering statistical power.  Recruitment was conducted via Qualtrics Panel Studies. To participate in the study, respondents needed to identify as non-cisgender. Cisgender is typically defined as concordance between one’s sex assigned at birth and gender identity. Participants in the current study were non-cisgender and identified, for example, as transgender, gender nonbinary, gender nonconforming, or agender, among others. Additionally, respondents were 18 years of age or older and were currently residing in the United States. Participants must also have been in a past romantic partner relationship or endorse being currently partnered.  Table 1 depicts the demographic data for the study sample. Most participants (58.4%) reported an income of $40,000 or less and nearly two-thirds of participants (64.8%) identified their race as White. Nearly 14% (13.6%) endorsed Hispanic or Latinx or Spanish racial identity, and 12.8% of respondents identified as multiracial or biracial. It should be noted that participants were provided the option to select multiple racial identifiers. As such, the total percentage for race in Table 1 surpasses 100%. Participants varied in education, with 4% of respondents endorsing no formal education and 0.8% reporting having earned a doctoral degree. Roughly a third (31.2%) reported earning a high school diploma, and nearly 40% (38.4%) endorsed 36 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  completing some college coursework. A third (33.6%) identified their community type as being a small city or town, and another third (33.6%) reported living in a suburb near a large city. The remaining participants reported living in a rural area (20%) and large city (12.8%). Regarding relationship status, most participants reported being in a serious relationship (26.4%), being single (24.8%), or being engaged or married (16%). The remaining participants reported casually dating one partner (13.6%), polyamory (10.4%) or consensually nonmanogomous relationships (4.0%), being separated or divorced (2.4%), or casually dating two or more partners (1.6%). The final 0.8% of participants selected the “Indicate Another Answer” option, for which the respondent wrote, “queerplatonic relationship.” Due to the volume and variety of write-in response options for sexual orientation identity, this variable was collapsed for parsimony in analysis. The condensed categories were created through extensive consultation and analysis of sexual orientation and identity research (Hatchel et al., 2018; Messinger et al., 2021). The same research process was applied to the gender identity variable to condense categories for analysis (Hughto et al., 2017; Shipherd et al., 2011). This researcher acknowledges the limitations of this decision and the importance of identity visibility to counteract erasure and silencing, both socially and in the realm of research. A full list of sexual orientation identity terms used by participants can be found in Appendix E. A full list of gender identity terms used by respondents can be found in Appendix F. After collapsing sexual orientation terms, the largest sexual orientation identity group was those identifying as queer (22.4%), followed by bisexual (20%) and pansexual (19.2%). The remaining participants (8%) identified as asexual. For gender identity, most respondents (52.8%) identified as nonbinary, followed by transmale (19.2%), genderfluid or genderqueer (10.4%), and agender (5.6%).  37 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  Table 1   Demographic Data for the Sample (n = 125)   Variables                 Percentage  Age M = 24.92     SD = 7.16   Income   Under $20,000  25.60% $20,001 – $40,000  32.80% $40,001 – $60,000  20.80% $60,001 – $80,000  10.40% $80,001 – $100,000  5.60% $100,001 or over  4.80%    Education   No Formal Education  4.00% High School Diploma  31.20% Some College Coursework  38.40% College Degree  7.20% Vocational Training  1.60% Bachelor’s Degree  12.80% Master’s Degree  4.00% Doctorate Degree  0.80%    Community Type   Small City or Town  33.60% Suburb Near a Large City  33.60% Rural Area Large City  20.00% 12.80%    Race   White/Caucasian Hispanic or Latinx or Spanish Multiracial or Biracial Black or African American Not Hispanic or Latinx or Spanish Indicate Another Answer Asian Asian American/Alaska Native  64.80% 13.60% 12.80% 11.20% 4.80% 4.00% 2.40% 1.60% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander  1.60%    Relationship Status   Serious Relationship Single  26.40% 24.80% Engaged or Married  16.00% 38 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  Casually Dating One Partner 13.60% Polyamorous Relationship Consensual Nonmonogamy Separated or Divorced Casually Dating Two or More Partners  10.40% 4.00% 2.40% 1.60% Indicate Another Answer  0.80%    Sexual Orientation   Queer  22.40% Bisexual  20.00% Pansexual  19.20% Asexual  8.00%    Gender Identity   Nonbinary  52.80% Transmale  19.20% Genderfluid or Genderqueer  10.40% Agender  5.60%  Note: Complete list of identifiers available in Appendices E and F   Measures This study employed the use of four instruments to assess the relationships among adverse childhood experiences, internalized transphobia, and intimate partner violence experiences among GM respondents. The instruments described below were selected for their relevance to the research question, rigorous scale development, brevity, and utility. The final instrument described below is an 8-item demographics questionnaire that was used to provide descriptive statistics about the sample in addition to measuring control variables.  The Revised Conflict Tactics Scales Short Form (CTS2S; Straus & Douglas, 2004) To assess the outcome variable, IPV victimization, participants completed The Revised Conflict Tactics Scales Short Form (CTS2S; Straus & Douglas, 2004, See Appendix A). The CTS2S is widely used to evaluate physical, sexual, and emotional violence in intimate relationships. The CTS2S includes 20 items that separate conflict tactics experiences into five 39 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  classifications: physical assault, assault with injury, sexual coercion, negotiation, and psychological aggression. The original CTS2 is comprised of 78 items, but for brevity, the CTS2 Short Form was used.   The authors reported an instrument completion time of approximately three minutes, making the CTS2S a brief measure for research. Sample items on the CTS2S include, “My partner insulted or swore or shouted or yelled at me” and “My partner used force (like hitting, holding down, or using a weapon) to make me have sex.” Score responses are measured on an 8-point frequency scale, with a response of 1 reflecting that an item happened “Once in the past year.” A response of 4 indicates “6-10 times in the past year” and a response of 6 corresponds to “More than 20 times in the past year.” A score of 7 indicates that an item happened “Not in the past year, but it did happen before” and a score of 8 indicates that “This has never happened.”  Scoring each item is conducted by summing the midpoints for response options selected by participants. Answer categories are first converted from the 1- to 8-point frequency to a 0 to 7 score (Straus et al., 1996). The midpoint for response options 0, 1, and 2 are therefore the same as the numbers for the response categories (8, recoded as 0 = This has never happened; 1 = Once in the past year; 2 = Twice in the past year). The midpoint for category 3 (3-5 times in the past year) is 4, the midpoint for category 4 (6-10 times in the past year) is 8, and the midpoint for category 5 (11-20 times in the past year) is 15. The authors recommend using a midpoint of 25 for category 6 (More than 20 times in the past year) (Straus et al., 1996). Category 7 (Not in the past year, but it did happen before) can be coded for lifetime prevalence with a score of 1 or coded as 0 to identify no past year prevalence. For the purposes of the current study, lifetime prevalence scoring was used, meaning that those who respond to items with the number 7 were 40 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  coded as a score of 1. Those who endorse no past year prevalence for a given item were scored as 0. The research team who created the CTS2 reported good internal consistency reliability, as evidenced by the congruence of each item selected for subscales of the CTS2. The Psychological Aggression subscale had the lowest internal consistency reliability with an alpha of 0.79. Both the Negotiation and Physical Assault subscales had an alpha of 0.86, while the Sexual Coercion subscale demonstrated an alpha of 0.87. The highest internal consistency reliability was found on the Injury subscale, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.95 (Straus et al., 1996).  Concurrent validity was established via correlations between the CTS2 and the approximation iteration of the CTS2S. The CTS2S is considered an approximation due to the augmentation of items to avoid underreporting. Items were expanded to clarify and specify different behaviors that would fall under different violence classifications. On the Severe Assault scale, for example, the item “Beat up my partner” was modified to read, “Punched or kicked or beat up my partner” (Straus & Douglas, 2004). The authors reported concurrent validity via correlations between the CTS2 and the CTS2S. The lowest correlation was found on the Sexual Coercion scale, with r = .67 for Sexual Coercion by the partner and r = .65 for Sexual Coercion by the respondent. The highest correlation was found on the Injury scale, with both respondent and partner evidencing r = .94.  Construct validity for the CTS2S was provided via correlations with four of the risk factors identified by the Personal and Relationships Profile (PRP; Straus & Mouradian, 1999), including Criminal History, Couple Conflict, Anger Management, and Violence Approval. The authors provided evidentiary support for the construct validity of the CTS2S via conceptual 41 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  equivalency to the CTS2 and the CTS2’s correlations with the aforementioned risk factors. However, it must be noted that only partial correlations were obtained for the risk factors on the CTS2S given that the psychometric study was conducted with individual participants in lieu of romantically involved participant dyads.  The coefficients reported by Straus and Douglas (2004) indicate a high correlation between the constructs assessed on the full CTS2 and the shortened CTS2S. Construct validity for the short form of the CTS2 was discerned by computing partial correlations between the short and long forms of the CTS2 and the five risk factors for IPV identified on the Personal and Relationships Profile (Straus & Mouradian, 1999). Of the pairs of correlations computed, only one correlation reached statistical significance, thus indicating a difference between the CTS2 and the CTS2S. The correlation between Negative Attributions on the PRP and psychological aggression towards a partner was significantly lower (r = .04) on the short form compared to the long form (r = .19). These correlations reached significance at the .001 level and denote conceptual equivalence and construct validity between the long and short forms of the CTS2, with the exception of the correlation for Negative Attributions.  The validity of the CTS2S was further assessed via prevalence rates for endorsing specific conflict behaviors. When compared to the long form, the CTS2S resulted in lower endorsement of each conflict behavior. This finding is reflective of the principle that the diversity of items included in a behavioral measure is directly related to the prevalence rate of the behaviors. As items are winnowed down for conservation of time and simplicity, the prevalence rate decreases as well. The total score on the CTS2S served as the criterion variable in the current analyses. The Cronbach’s alpha for the current study was 0.80, as seen in Table 2. Adverse Childhood Experiences Survey (ACES; Felitti et al., 1998) 42 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  The Adverse Childhood Experiences Survey (ACES; Felitti et al., 1998) is a measure of exposure to household dysfunction and childhood abuse. This measure served as a predictor variable in the current study (see Appendix B). The ACES is a 17-item binary response (Y/N) measure, with higher scores indicating endorsement of exposure to a greater number of traumatic childhood events. Individuals respond to items such as, “Did a parent or other adult in the household often or very often swear at, insult, or put you down?” and, “Was your mother or stepmother sometimes, often, or very often kicked, bitten, hit with a fist, or hit with something hard?” The instrument includes three types of childhood abuse categories, including Physical, Psychological, and Contact Sexual. The ACES also includes four types of exposure to dysfunction in the household, including Violent Treatment of Mother or Stepmother, Criminal Behavior, Mental Illness, and Substance Abuse. Individuals who respond with the “yes” option are identified as having been exposed to a specific category of dysfunction or abuse. Total scores are computed by summing the number of “yes” responses across items. The number of potential exposures therefore ranges from 0 (unexposed) to 7 (exposed to all categories).  Bethell and colleagues (2017) proposed that cumulative scoring is most appropriate for the ACES. Cumulative scoring was employed in the current study. Research conducted with the ACES has consistently reported a dose-response effect for exposure to adversity in childhood and various physical and mental health concerns in adulthood (Dube et al., 2004; Felitti et al., 1998). An ACES score of four or more has been identified as the critical cutoff for increasing one’s risk for mental and physical health concerns in adulthood (Felitti et al., 1998).  Ford and colleagues (2014) reported acceptable Cronbach’s alphas in their ACES factor analysis study. Internal consistency reliability was highest for the Sexual Abuse subscale and the overall ACES score, both of which were reported as 0.80. The authors reported a Cronbach’s 43 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  alpha coefficient of 0.61 for Household Dysfunction. Ford and colleagues also reported a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.78 for the total ACES measure, indicating that each item identifies an adverse childhood experience and that the items are overall related to one another. Bethell and colleagues (2017) reported similar evidence of reliability in their study comparing the psychometric properties of different versions of the ACES, identifying no reliability or validity concerns for any ACES form. Using a 10-item version of the ACES, Esaki and Larkin (2013) reported a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.73. Research conducted with an international version of the ACES in Nigeria reported a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.80 (Kazeem, 2015).  In 2004, Dube and colleagues assessed the test-retest reliability of the ACES, reporting kappa coefficients for different abuse categories with the same respondents over an average of 20 months between waves I and II. The researchers reported a kappa coefficient of .69 for sexual abuse (95% CI, .61-.77), .55 for physical abuse (95% CI, .47-.63), and .66 for emotional abuse (95% CI, .55-.76). Additionally, the researchers reported test-retest reliability across a twenty-month span for household dysfunction items, reporting a kappa coefficient of .46 for incarcerated household members (95% CI, .27-.65) and .51 for mental illness in the home (95% CI, .42-.61). The kappa coefficient for parent divorce or separation was reported as .86 (95% CI, .81-.91) and the kappa coefficient for household substance use was .75 (95% CI, .68-.81). Finally, the kappa coefficient for maternal figure being treated violently was .77 (95% CI, .68-.85) (Dube et al., 2004).  Additionally, other researchers employed confirmatory factor analysis to assess the internal and external validity of the ACES (Bethell et al., 2017). The researchers found that a single-factor model of the National Survey of Children’s Health-Adverse Childhood Experiences Survey (NSCH-ACEs), a variation of the original ACES measure, fit the data well (chi-square = 44 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  312.84; p <.01). Support for the predictive validity of the instrument was reported with significant odds ratio increases in behavioral, emotional, or mental problems as ACES scores increased. Predictive validity was also supported with critical education variables. Individuals with lower ACES scores were more likely to receive higher scores on a measure of school engagement. Compared to low ACES respondents, those with higher ACES scores were more likely to have repeated a grade in school. Concurrent validity has been demonstrated via correlation between total scores and subscale scores on the Adverse Childhood Experience International Questionnaire (ACE IQ) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) in international samples (Kazeem, 2015). Kazeem (2015) reported a total score correlation of r = 0.72 between the ACE IQ and CTQ. Subscale score correlations ranged from r = 0.23 for the Relationship with Parents/Guardians ACE IQ subscale and the Emotional Neglect subscale of the CTQ to r = 0.65 for the Family Environment ACE IQ subscale and the Sexual Abuse CTQ subscale (Kazeem, 2015). The ACES served as a predictor variable in this study and the Cronbach’s alpha in the current study was 0.87, as seen in Table 2.  Gender Minority Stress and Resilience Scale – Internalized Transphobia (Testa et al., 2015) The Internalized Transphobia (IT) subscale of the Gender Minority Stress and Resilience Scale (Testa et al., 2015) was used as a mediator variable to assess the associations of internalized transphobia, adverse childhood experiences, and intimate partner violence victimization in adulthood (see Appendix C). The Cronbach’s alpha in the current study was 0.91, as seen in Table 2. The IT is an 8-item, 5-point Likert-type scale that is part of the 60-item Gender Minority Stress and Resilience Scale. Sample items include, “I resent my gender identity or expression” and, “When I think about my gender identity or expression, I feel unhappy.” 45 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  Response options range from 0 (Strongly Disagree) to 4 (Strongly Agree). Scoring is summative, with total higher scores indicating greater degrees of internalized transphobia.  Internal consistency reliabilities for the IT subscale range from 0.89 to 0.90 in international contexts (Cronin et al., 2019; Scandurra et al., 2020) to 0.91 in the standardization sample (Testa et al., 2015) to 0.92 with adolescent participants in the United States (Hidalgo et al., 2019). The IT subscale has demonstrated evidence of convergent validity with measures of perceived life stress (r = 0.39 in Scandurra et al., 2020; r = 0.47 in Testa et al., 2015). Using general and gender-specific parental support as a proxy for life stress, Hidalgo and colleagues (2019) reported evidence of convergent validity of the IT subscale via inverse correlations to support, indicating that those endorsing more internalized transphobia also endorsed less general parental support (r = -0.36) and less gender-specific parental affirmation (r = -0.40).  Criterion validity was reported with the standardization sample via correlations between the subscales and measures of depression (r = 0.49) and social anxiety (r = 0.38; Testa et al., 2015). In a standardization sample conducted with Italian transgender participants, criterion validity of the IT subscale was supported via correlations with measures of depression (r = 0.35) and generalized anxiety (r = 0.42; Scandurra et al., 2020). When employed with an adolescent sample, researchers provided support for criterion validity for the IT subscale with measures of depression (r = 0.39) and social anxiety (r = 0.34; Hidalgo et al., 2019). Discriminant validity for the IT subscale was supported via weak to moderate correlations with scales measuring life stress and interpersonal experiences (Testa et al., 2015). These findings provide support for the unique nature of gender-related stress and highlight the distinction of gender minority stress from general life stressors.        Demographics Questionnaire  46 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  Participants also completed an 8-item demographic survey (see Appendix D). Participants reported a variety of demographic information, including age, socioeconomic status, relationship status, race/ethnicity, geographic location, and education level. Finally, participants reported their sexual orientation and gender identity. Consistent with previous literature (Anderson et al., 2017; Gonzalez-Guarda et al., 2016), sexual orientation identity was asked as an open-ended question, allowing for participants to self-identify. Similarly, gender identity was assessed using an open-ended question (Watson et al., 2019). These items were later quantitatively and qualitatively coded. Items were qualitatively coded by collapsing synonyms into one category, such as including responses of “genderfluid” and “gender nonbinary” in the same category of Nonbinary. Quantitatively, responses were categorized and dummy coded for ease of analysis.  Procedure  Participants were recruited via convenience sampling using Qualtrics Panel Studies. Qualtrics Panel Studies are frequently utilized for participant recruitment in behavioral and social sciences research (Cogan et al., 2020; Gillig et al., 2018; Zickgraf & Ellis, 2018). By using marketing research panels with respondents who have previously agreed to participate on a panel, Qualtrics Panel Studies quickly recruits participants with specified characteristics. Participants are pre-screened by Qualtrics to mitigate attrition rates and stereotyped responding. Qualtrics Panel Studies have frequently been used with difficult-to-reach populations, including transgender individuals (Cogan et al., 2020), people with disordered eating behaviors (Zickgraf & Ellis, 2018), and attitudinal research towards minoritized populations (Gillig et al., 2018). Qualtrics further expedites survey research by having panelists input their demographic information at the outset of their participation on panels, thus streamlining their ability to quickly 47 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  identify and recruit the appropriate participants. Participants in the current study were recruited through three initial soft launches of the survey as well as two waves of full recruitment. Interested respondents began their participation by clicking a check box indicating their informed consent documenting their role in the study, any potential risks and benefits, confidentiality, crisis contact information, and compensation. Participants completed four measures, including the CTS2S (Straus & Douglas, 2004), ACES (Felitti et al., 1998), the IT subscale of the Gender Minority Stress and Resilience Scale (Testa et al., 2015), and an 8-item demographics questionnaire. The CTS2S, ACES, and IT measures were presented in a counterbalanced order. Each measure included a written instruction page prior to presentation of the measure itself. Qualtrics Panel Studies participants were compensated directly through the survey engine.  Finally, participants were directed to a debriefing page detailing the purpose of the study and were provided with a list of counseling and crisis resources should they experience any distress from participation. All participants were provided with national service options and resources for IPV. Respondents were encouraged to utilize mental health resources as needed and to contact study personnel if they wished for their data to be withdrawn from the study or needed further assistance. Attentiveness in responding was evaluated via sporadic fidelity checks throughout each instrument. To protect the safety of participants and to maximize disclosure, participants will be encouraged to take the survey in a private location when they are alone.       48 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  CHAPTER 3 Results  The purpose of the current study was to determine the relation between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and intimate partner violence (IPV) in non-cisgender populations. The current analyses aimed to better understand the possible mediation role of internalized transphobia (IT) between ACES and IPV.   This research was a cross-sectional, single distribution survey, quantitative design. Participants completed a one-time survey via Qualtrics survey software. The study hypotheses were:  H1: There will be a significant, positive correlation between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and IPV experiences in adulthood.  H2: There will be a significant, positive correlation between IT and IPV experiences in adulthood.  H3: The relationship between adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence will be mediated by internalized transphobia.  The Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25 (SPSS) software was employed to perform statistical analyses for the study (SPSS; I.B.M. Corp, 2017). Correlational analyses were used to understand the relationships between the three main variables of the study – ACES, IT, and IPV. This research also utilized regression analyses to determine if internalized transphobia mediated the associations between childhood adversity and intimate partner violence. There were several control variables used in this study, including race, sexual orientation identity, and gender identity. This chapter presents the preliminary and primary analyses of the study.  Preliminary Analyses 49 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  Tests of Statistical Assumptions To perform a mediated regression, the following assumptions must be met: normality, linearity, homogeneity of error variance, and independence of errors. The data were analyzed preliminarily via bivariate correlations between predictors to ensure that there are no concerns with multicollinearity. Multicollinearity exists when there is redundancy between predictor variables, therefore undermining the statistical significance of the test (Judd et al., 2017). The data were then analyzed for linearity, homogeneity of variance, and normality. Linearity is necessary for regression analyses as it demonstrates a linear relationship between the predictor variable and the outcome variable. Homogeneity of variance must be present for the use of multiple regression as this indicates equivalent variability in errors across the distribution (Judd et al., 2017). Finally, the data must evidence a normal distribution. After ensuring that the data met the requirements of the statistical assumptions, descriptive statistics were analyzed.     Descriptive Statistics  Descriptive statistics were calculated for the ACES, GMSRS, and CTS2S. Table 2 depicts the descriptive statistics calculated for the main study measures. The ACES had a mean score of 3.46 (SD = 1.88), indicating that participants reported an average of 3.5 adverse events prior to age eighteen. The IT subscale of the GMSRS yielded an average score of 20.76 (SD = 9.10), with responses ranging from 0 (Strongly Disagree) to 4 (Strongly Agree), indicating that participants reported moderate internalized transphobia. The CTS2S demonstrated a mean of 25.70 (SD = 27.71), indicating that participants reported roughly 25 incidences of conflict tactics occurring within the past year. Responses for each individual conflict tactic ranged from 0 (This has never happened) to 25 (More than 20 times in the past year). After coding, the possible 50 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  range on the CTS2S spans from 0 to 256. As such, participants in the current study endorsed conflict tactics in the lowest 10% frequency.

H2: There will be a significant, positive correlation between IT and IPV experiences in adulthood.   H3: The relationship between adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence will be mediated by internalized transphobia.  Bivariate Correlation Analyses A series of bivariate correlations were conducted to discern the relationships between the study variables, as seen in Table 3. Three significant and positive associations were found in 51 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  these analyses. First, there was a significant and positive association between ACEs and IT (r = 0.18, p = .04), meaning that as the number of adverse childhood experiences increased, so too did respondents’ endorsement of internalized transphobia. Additionally, a significant, positive correlation was found between ACEs and CTS2S scores (r = 0.35, p < .01). This finding indicates that higher endorsement of adverse childhood experiences was associated with higher endorsement of conflict tactics. This finding supports the first study hypothesis, which stated that there would be a significant, positive correlation between ACEs and IPV experiences. Finally, a significant, positive association was found between IT and CTS2S scores (r = 0.26, p < .01). This finding indicates that higher endorsement of internalized transphobia was associated with higher endorsement of conflict tactics. This finding supports the second hypothesis of the study, which stated that there would be a significant, positive correlation between IT and IPV experiences.

The first hypothesis stated that there would be a significant, positive relationship between ACEs and IPV experiences. Table 4 depicts Model 1 and Model 2 of the analyses. Model 1 demonstrates that ACEs significantly and positively predicts CTS2S scores (adj R2 = .05; SE = 26.93; β = .25; p < .01). This finding indicates that those endorsing ACEs were more likely to endorse IPV experiences. Model 2 adds the control variables of sexual orientation, race, and gender identity, each of which used binary coding with 0 for the reference category and 1 for all other categories. For sexual orientation, queer was the reference group. White was the reference group for race and nonbinary was the reference group for gender identity. Even when controlling for the abovementioned covariates, ACEs still significantly and positively predicted CTS2S scores (adj R2 = .05; SE = 26.93; β = .26; p < .01). This finding means that after controlling for differences in sexual orientation identity, racial identity, and gender identity, ACES scores were still predictive of endorsement of IPV experiences. Those endorsing childhood adversity were more likely to also endorse IPV experiences on the CTS2S. Conversely, those who did not endorse childhood adversity were less likely to also endorse IPV experiences on the CTS2S. Taken together, the regression analyses presented in Table 4 support the first hypothesis of the study.

Table 5 depicts Model 1 and Model 2 of the analyses. Model 1 demonstrates that IT was significantly and positively predictive of CTS2S scores (adj R2 = .06; SE = 26.86; β = .26; p < .01). This finding indicates that higher IT scores were predictive of higher CTS2S scores. The three control variables, sexual orientation identity, racial identity, and gender identity, were added into Model 2 using the same binary coding for the reference groups. After controlling for the covariates, IT was still significantly and positively predictive of IPV experiences measured on the CTS2S (adj R2 = .06; SE = 26.79; β = .29; p < .01). This finding means that after controlling for variations in sexual orientation identity, racial identity, and gender identity, IT was still predictive of endorsement of IPV experiences. Those 54 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  who endorsed more internalized transphobia also endorsed more IPV experiences. Conversely, those who endorsed less internalized transphobia also endorsed fewer IPV experiences. Taken together, the regression analyses presented in Table 5 support the second hypothesis of the study.

Table 6 depicts Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3 of the analyses. Model 1 demonstrates that ACES scores were significantly and positively predictive of IPV experiences as measured by the CTS2S (adj R2= .05; SE=26.93; β = .25; p < .01). Model 2 adds the control variables of sexual orientation identity, racial identity, and gender identity. After controlling for the covariates, ACES scores were still significantly and positively predictive of CTS2S scores (adj R2=.05; SE=26.93; β = .26; p < .01). In Model 3, internalized transphobia (IT) is included in the model as the mediating variable as well as the abovementioned control variables. This mediated regression analysis indicates that while IT is significant in the model scores (adj R2= .10; SE=26.22; β = .24; p < .01), ACES scores are also still significant (adj R2= .10; SE=26.22; β = .21; p < .01). These findings indicate that ACEs and IT were independently predictive of CTS2S scores, but IT is not a mediator between ACEs and IPV scores as measured on the CTS2S. Therefore, hypothesis three of the study was not supported.

In the first analysis, adverse childhood experiences were significantly predictive of intimate partner violence, meaning that those who endorsed experiencing childhood adversity also endorsed experiencing intimate partner violence. In the second regression analysis, internalized transphobia was significantly predictive of intimate partner violence. This finding indicates that those endorsing higher levels of internalized transphobia were more likely to endorse more intimate partner violence. In the third regression, childhood adversity and 57 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  internalized transphobia were independently predictive of intimate partner violence. However, internalized transphobia did not mediate the relationship between ACES scores and the CTS2S.                       58 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  Chapter 4 Discussion   This research extended previous findings that explored relationship dynamics for individuals identifying as GM. This research also addressed a critical gap in the IPV literature by exploring the relationship of internalized transphobia with childhood adversity and intimate partner violence. Previous research has found that gender minority individuals report experiencing high rates of intimate partner violence (Breiding et al., 2015; Messinger, 2017; Peitzmeier et al., 2020). Participants in the current study reported similar IPV experiences in line with previous findings, with 96% of participants endorsing lifetime prevalence of any form of IPV. Nearly one-third (32.8%) of respondents endorsed experiencing lifetime sexual coercion from their intimate partner and nearly one-quarter (23.2%) reported lifetime physical aggression. These results align with previous research findings that approximately 33% of GM individuals living in the United States have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner (Keuroghlian et al., 2015; Messinger, 2017). One-fifth (20%) of participants endorsed lifetime experience of assault with injury and roughly two-thirds (66.4%) reported experiencing psychological aggression from their intimate partner.    Results from this study support the hypothesis that a significant positive correlation exists between ACEs and IPV experiences. This finding builds upon previous research indicating that experiences of childhood trauma are associated with intimate partner violence in adulthood. Specifically, previous research with sexual minority individuals has found that witnessing IPV at home and history of abuse in childhood predicted IPV in adulthood (Mason et al., 2016). This relationship holds true for cisgender heterosexual individuals (Anderson & Kras, 2005), as well as women experiencing incarceration (Jones et al., 2018), and those identifying as LGBTQ 59 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  (Messinger, 2017). Additionally, the current research supports previous findings that witnessing IPV in childhood leads individuals to expect and accept IPV as a normative part of their relationships in adulthood (Lee et al., 2016). Thus, it appears that experiencing adversity in childhood predisposes individuals identifying with a minoritized gender identity to victimization in their adult relationships. While theoretical, this finding may indicate that ACEs can shape expectations for adult relationships, such that those exposed to ACEs differentially anticipate violence in their intimate partnerships compared to those without ACEs. Modeling of relationship violence in the home during childhood may therefore shape perceptions of and expectations for violence in the fabric of future intimate partnerships (Anderson & Kras, 2005; Bandura, 1973).   Additionally, findings from the current study support the hypothesis that there is a significant, positive correlation between IT and IPV. This means that those who internalize stigma and discrimination related to their gender identity were more likely to report experiencing intimate partner violence. Similar to the expectations for relational violence stemming from childhood trauma, it is possible that internalized shame regarding one’s gender identity leads to expectations of victimization. These individuals may internalize the erroneous belief that because of their gender identity, they are less worthy of affirming and non-abusive relationships compared to their cisgender peers (Rood et al., 2017). Additionally, GM individuals who experience internalized transphobia may normalize experiences of violence as a typical component of gender minority relationships. Thus, these individuals may fail to recognize violence when it occurs in their relationships and may anticipate relational aggression as a normative part of non-cisgender partnerships. Previous qualitative research has found that internalized transphobia is associated with increased expectations and acceptance of 60 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  interpersonal victimization (Rood et al., 2017). Therefore, it appears that individuals who identify as GM expect victimization, both broadly and within their romantic relationships. Given the small and tight-knit nature of GM communities (Bockting et al., 2020; Hidalgo et al., 2019), gender minority individuals may further normalize their experiences of IPV through discussion with other GM community members, thereby creating a culture of identity violence expectations and acceptance.  Further, GM survivors of IPV have reported that both internal and external shame related to gender identity serves as a barrier to not only disclosing IPV, but also recognizing IPV behaviors (Everhart & Hunnicutt, 2014; Kurdyla, 2021). Thus, those who experience IPV are less likely to discuss their concerns with others. These survivors are also less likely to identify their relationship experiences as abusive. Many GM survivors report difficulty recognizing IPV in their relationships and that this impacts their ability to reach out for support within systems that are designed for cisgender heterosexual survivors (Everhart & Hunnicutt, 2014). Gender minority individuals may therefore be less likely to access support from police and emergency housing organizations due to concerns that systemic support will be unavailable to them. Relatedly, GM survivors may also avoid systems-level support and interventions due to fear of discrimination and further violence within structures designed to support victims (Hendricks & Testa, 2012; Hidalgo et al., 2019). These factors comprise the foundation of minority stress. The pathway from internalized transphobia to intimate partner violence can be understood through the minority stress model (Hendricks & Testa, 2012) in which gender identity-related adverse experiences foster expectations for future victimization and internalized shame (Scheer et al., 2020). Many adverse experiences related to gender identity occur within oppressive systems that do not offer equitable care to GM individuals and also outrightly 61 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  discriminate and propagate violence against those identifying as gender diverse. In the context of the current study, the gender minority stress pathway indicates that the process of internalizing discriminatory self-image related to gender identity poses a specific risk for individuals to experience subsequent intimate partner victimization.   While unexpected, the findings from this study did not support the hypothesis that IT would mediate the relationship between ACEs and IPV. The data indicates that IT was trending towards significance. However, the independent associations between ACEs and IPV, as well as IT and IPV, were stronger. While this finding does not support hypothesis three in the current study, this data nevertheless provides new insight into the topography of victimizations experienced by GM individuals. Previous work has found a positive association between internalized heterosexism and IPV shame in sexual minority women (Thaggard & Montayre, 2019). It is possible that the process of internalizing identity shame presents differently for GM individuals, such that IT does not predict IPV shame. Further, systemic barriers and identity oppression may impact GM survivors’ ability to name their experiences as abusive. Further, findings from the current study provide additional support for the pervasiveness of childhood adversity among those identifying as gender minorities. Sixteen percent of participants endorsed at least one adverse childhood experience, with 52% endorsing four or more ACEs. This finding surpasses that found by Craig and colleagues (2020), in which 43% of LGBTQ+ participants ages 14-29 endorsed experiencing four or more ACEs. In the original ACES study, Felitti and colleagues (1998) reported that 6.2% of participants endorsed experiencing four or more ACEs. Similarly, a nationally representative sample in England found that 9% of participants reported experiencing four or more ACEs (Bellis et al., 2014). Finally, among social workers serving children in the Northeastern United States, 15.9% of participants 62 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  endorsed a history of four or more ACEs (Esaki & Larkin, 2013). Extant research indicates that irrespective of gender identity, those who report four or more ACEs are more likely to experience a sequelae of negative health outcomes in adulthood, including mood disorders, obesity, poor cardiac health, and suicidality (Brown et al., 2017; Clements-Nolle et al., 2018; Dube et al., 2001; Felitti et al., 1998; Forster et al., 2018). This finding is especially elevated for those identifying as non-cisgender (Schnarrs et al., 2019; Tobin & Delaney, 2019).    Limitations  While this research provided novel insight into the experiences of gender diverse individuals, it is not without limitations. First, this study utilized self-report to gather participant data. As such, the accuracy of demographic items and responses to study instruments could not be verified. This research attempted to minimize the risk of obtaining erroneous responses from individuals by recruiting participants via Qualtrics Panel Studies. Qualtrics Panel Studies recruits participants who self-identified demographic characteristics prior to study enrollment (Cogan et al., 2020). While this recruitment strategy minimizes the risk of unqualified respondents from participating, response veracity for each individual participant cannot be guaranteed. Relatedly, this study utilized convenience sampling, which resulted in selection bias and limits the external validity of the findings.    Another limitation of the current study is access to the survey. Using Qualtrics Panel Studies requires participants to have access to the internet, which may restrict the range of participants from various socioeconomic statuses. The demographics of participants indicate a wide spectrum of class identification. The majority of participants (58.4%) endorsed earning $40,000 or less annually, while 41.6% reported earning $40,001 or more annually. Effort was made in the current study to recruit participants from across socioeconomic backgrounds. 63 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  However, the recruitment strategy nevertheless likely neglected to include those experiencing severe financial distress. Those who are extremely low-income likely did not have access to the survey and these individuals may be at the highest risk of experiencing IPV. Because of this, the current data may underrepresent the range and severity of IPV in the GM population.  Extant research has found that gender minority individuals living below the poverty line are among the most likely to experience violence, including intimate partner violence (Kattari et al., 2022; King et al., 2022). Additionally, gender minority individuals living below the poverty line are more likely to engage in survival crimes such as sex work (Cerezo et al., 2014). These individuals may experience a disproportionate amount of IPV due to overlapping areas of marginalization (Keuroghlian et al., 2015). Relatedly, those identifying as gender minorities are more likely to experience homelessness in youth, which has been linked to an increased endorsement of internalized transphobia and familial rejection (Keuroghlian et al., 2015; Koken et al., 2009). Thus, the current study may underrepresent the prevalence and severity of IPV, ACEs, and IT in gender minority individuals.   The current study is also limited by the relatively small sample size, which necessitated collapsing of gender identity categories and sexual orientation categories. With a larger sample, different identity groups could have been analyzed independently to provide deeper insight into the topography and prevalence of study variables across gender identities and sexual orientations. The collapsing of gender identities and sexual orientations was conducted after extensive consultation with existing research (Hatchel et al., 2018; Hughto et al., 2017; Messinger et al., 2021; Shipherd et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the nuance of variable expression across identities may have been muted due to the coding strategy employed in this research. It is possible that differences exist in IPV experiences for those identifying as nonbinary compared to 64 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  individuals who identify as transgender compared to transgender men and transgender women. With a larger sample size, the analyses could have tested for between-group differences in endorsement of study variables. Previous research with sexual minority women has found that internalized heterosexism and shame associated with IPV experiences contributed to lower rates of help-seeking and further IPV victimization (Thaggard & Montayre, 2019). It is possible that the small sample size in the current study precluded the detection of a similar trend with internalized transphobia.  Additionally, the brevity of the IT instrument may have not fully captured the experiences of participants, thus suppressing the potential mediating effect of IT in the relationship between ACEs and IPV. Further, a larger sample size would have allowed for more specific analysis of ACES items. Given that some ACEs are considered more severe than others (Andersen & Blosnich, 2013), individualized analysis could clarify how specific ACEs are correlated with IT and IPV. Additionally, many participants (64.8%) self-identified as White, with 35.2% identifying as non-White. While the representation of non-White participants is a strength of the current study, previous research indicates that those identifying as non-White experience higher rates of IPV (Reuter et al., 2017). As such, findings from the current study may not fully capture the experiences of survivors identifying as people of color. Findings from this work may therefore be less generalizable to non-White GM individuals.   Another limitation of the current study involves instrumentation. While the CTS2 and CTS2S are widely regarded as the gold standard in the field of intimate partner violence research, this instrument likely does not fully capture the IPV experiences of those identifying as gender minority. Recently, a scale was developed to specifically assess IPV experiences related to transgender identity. The Transgender Intimate Partner Violence scale (T-IPV; Peitzmeier et 65 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  al., 2021) includes items related to established IPV experiences as well as those specific to gender minority identity. This type of instrument can help further elucidate IPV experiences for those identifying as GM. The T-IPV includes items assessing for control and coercion of gender-affirming practices as well as verbal, physical, and sexual violence tactics that are specific to gendered body parts. By using the T-IPV, researchers can gain greater insight into not only the topography of IPV for GM individuals, but also the ways in which IT is related to the presentation of T-IPV.  Future Research Directions Future research should strive to recruit a larger sample size of participants holding a wider array of demographic diversity. Recruiting more participants may help elucidate the potential mediating role of internalized transphobia. Further, greater demographic diversity in a larger sample will help identify nuances in experience with study variables across different intersectional identities. For example, a larger study could parse apart experiences for participants identifying as gender nonbinary compared to those identifying as agender and genderfluid. Furthermore, recruiting participants from a wider range of socioeconomic classes could help in eliciting valuable information from those most impacted by childhood adversity, internalized transphobia, and intimate partner violence.   Additionally, future research should explore diverse instrumentation in the analysis of the study variables. Specifically, future research will benefit from utilizing the Transgender Intimate Partner Violence scale (T-IPV; Peitzmeier et al., 2021) as this scale was specifically developed to screen for IPV that is specific to transgender identity. This instrument was not used in the current research given that it was published after the proposal of this dissertation. Items on the T-IPV scale assess controlling behaviors enacted by one’s partner, including belittling of gender 66 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  identity, incorrect pronoun use, threats and behaviors related to outing an individual as transgender, and hiding or destroying gender-affirming items. Additionally, this scale includes items assessing when a partner pressures an individual to not pursue various aspects of transitioning and when a partner pressures an individual to present as a gender that does not match their gender identity (Peitzmeier et al., 2021). By using a GM-specific instrument, future research could provide greater insight into the relationships among ACEs, IT, and IPV.  Furthermore, analyzing the topography of IPV in digital landscapes could prove beneficial. Given the prevalence of social media and dating violence that occurs on various platforms, research on the topography of digital IPV for GM individuals could expand opportunities for prevention and intervention. Existing research indicates that those identifying as gender minorities experience and employ high rates of digital dating abuse tactics (Ellyson et al., 2021).    Subsequent research should also focus on the topography of IPV for gender minority college students. Research with the college population can include early intervention and prevention methods with the aim of decreasing the likelihood of future victimization. This may take the form of psychoeducational outreaches with pre-and-post outreach surveys to assess baseline knowledge of and experience with intimate partner violence.   Future research should also take a resiliency-based approach to better understand buffers for IPV and avenues for healing from various forms of adversity. Analysis using the resiliency subscales, Community Connectedness and Pride, on the GMSR measure (Testa et al., 2015) may prove particularly useful in underscoring the importance of community safety nets that may decrease the likelihood of experiencing IPV and/or promote growth and healing after experiencing violence. Similarly, the Pride subscale on the GMSR measure can provide novel 67 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  insight into how internalizing a sense of pride, rather than shame, regarding one’s gender identity can mitigate risk factors for violence victimization.   Relatedly, subsequent analyses can also use dyadic recruitment strategies to involve both partners. This recruitment strategy would necessitate modification for gender minority participants who are in polyamorous relationships. By recruiting both partners in the relationship, researchers can gain a fuller understanding of the experience of each study variable by both members of the dyad. This type of recruitment would be beneficial for additional intervention research focusing on building collaborative communication skills (Cook-Daniels, 2015). Given the value of community in minoritized communities, dyads participating in this type of intervention research could prove invaluable in disseminating collaborative communication techniques to their social circles, many of whom may also have experienced or be experiencing similar challenges.  Implications for Counseling Psychologists  Given the field’s focus on multicultural considerations and identity development, counseling psychologists are well-suited to provide care for those identifying as GM. Several implications for training and clinical practice can be gleaned from the current study. First, findings from this research underscore the importance of attending to risk factors for IPV among gender minority clients. Specifically, understanding the impact of childhood adversity on IPV in adulthood is particularly salient for GM clients. Those who have experienced ACEs demonstrate an elevated risk of experiencing IPV. As clinicians, it is imperative to understand how childhood adversity places our GM clients at greater risk of subsequent victimization. Given the stigma and discrimination associated with GM identity, those identifying as gender minorities may be less likely to seek support and protection from established agencies, including law enforcement and 68 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  legal systems. GM clients may therefore seek support and guidance from counseling psychologists. Counseling psychologists must therefore be aware of local resources and protections available to GM individuals.   Relatedly, doctoral training regarding the nuances of GM IPV will be beneficial to burgeoning counseling psychologists. This type of training can take the form of didactic seminars and clinical engagement with local gender minority communities. Further, given that individuals from minoritized backgrounds face numerous barriers to seeking psychological services (Spengler et al., 2023), community engagement may prove crucial in connecting GM individuals with affirming clinical services. Counseling psychology trainees and clinicians will benefit from providing community outreach across local LGBTQ+ spaces. Focusing on prevention and strengths-based approaches may prove especially beneficial. For example, clinicians and trainees can provide outreaches to the community that focus on boundary setting, consent, and communication as a preventive strategy in helping clients establish reciprocally affirming and positive relationships and recognize early indicators of potential abuse in intimate partnerships.  Previous research has found that those identifying as gender minorities may have little support in establishing awareness of collaborative problem-solving in intimate partnerships (Cook-Daniels, 2015). Thus, certain aspects of IPV may be reflective of knowledge deficits and not intentional abuse. Providing comprehensive and identity-inclusive psychoeducational outreaches to this community may help individuals identifying as gender minorities feel more empowered to engage in collaborative problem-solving in their intimate partnerships, thereby decreasing instances of IPV. Additionally, community outreach may take the form of providing 69 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  psychoeducational outreaches to local partner organizations, including law enforcement, healthcare providers, and temporary housing shelters, among others.    Additionally, clinicians should be aware of the ways in which internalized transphobia impacts the psychological well-being of GM individuals. While the current findings did not demonstrate mediation in the relationship between ACEs and IPV, the mediating effect of IT was trending towards significance. This trend indicates that with a larger sample size, IT may hold significance in mediating the relationship between ACEs and IPV. Further, while IT did not demonstrate significance in this research, this form of internalized shame has been found to significantly impact other facets of well-being among GM individuals, including increased suicidality, depression, and occupational impairment, among others (Lee et al., 2020; Mizock et al., 2017; Perez-Brumer et al., 2015; Testa et al., 2017).  Conclusion This study sought to understand the relationship between ACEs, IT, and IPV in individuals identifying as gender minorities. Extant research has consistently identified links between experiencing adversity in childhood and negative physical and mental health outcomes in adulthood (Brown et al., 2017; Clements-Nolle et al., 2018; Dube et al., 2001; Felitti et al., 1998; Forster et al., 2018). Across a wide variety of outcomes correlated with ACEs, both victimization and perpetration of intimate partner violence remains a public health crisis. The current study echoes previous research findings that those identifying as GM experience disproportionately high rates of IPV (Messinger, 2017; Peitzmeier et al., 2020). Similarly, this study extended previous findings that non-cisgender individuals experience ACEs at a rate equivalent, if not greater than, their cisgender counterparts (Baams, 2018; Juárez-Chávez et al., 2018; Schnarrs et al., 2019; Tobin & Delaney, 2019).  70 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  Extant literature has found internalized shame to be related to both ACEs and IPV (Rood et al., 2017; Thaggard & Montayre, 2019; Thomson & Jaque, 2018b). Given the salience of internalized transphobia in impacting various facets of wellness for non-cisgender individuals, this study sought to understand the role of IT in the relationship between ACEs and IPV experiences. While IT was not found to be a significant mediator between ACEs and IPV, these findings nevertheless illuminate the experiences of gender minority individuals with respect to the aforementioned variables. Significant relationships between ACEs and IPV and IT and IPV were identified.                 71 ACES AND IPV IN GM POPULATIONS  References Afifi, T. O., Mota, N., Sareen, J., & MacMillan, H. L.

Couples also have many different ways of trying to settle their differences. This is a list of things that might happen when you have differences. Please mark how many times you did each of these things in the past year, and how many times your partner did them in the past year. If you or your partner did not do one of these things in the past year, but it happened before that, mark a “7” on your answer sheet for that question. If it never happened, mark an “8” on your answer sheet.   How often did this happen?  1 = Once in the past year        2 = Twice in the past year   3 = 3-5 times in the past year     4 = 6-10 times in the past year     5 = 11-20 times in the past year       6 = More than 20 times in the past year        7 = Not in the past year, but it did happen before        8 = This has never happened  1.

This project is being conducted by Claire McCown, M.P.S. in the Department of Counseling and Learning Sciences at West Virginia University under the supervision of Dr. Lisa Platt, an assistant professor in the College of Education and Human Services. Your participation in this project is greatly appreciated and will take approximately 15-20 minutes to fill out the attached questionnaire.   If you decide to participate, you will be asked to answer a variety of questions examining adverse childhood experiences, internalized transphobia, and intimate partner violence. Your involvement in this project will be kept as confidential as legally possible. All data will be reported in aggregate. You must identify as non-cisgender (do not identify as the gender you were assigned at birth), be 18 years of age or older, currently reside in the United States, and have been in a past romantic relationship or currently partnered in order to participate.      Your participation is completely voluntary. You may skip any question that you do not wish to answer, and you may discontinue the survey at any time. Your relationship with the university will not be affected if you decide either not to participate or to withdraw. West Virginia University’s Institutional Review Board’s acknowledgement of this project is on file.   In the event that you become distressed while completing the survey, please end the survey immediately and contact The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Treatment Referral Helpline – 1-877-SAMHSA7 (1-877-726-4727) for general information on mental health and locate treatment services in your area. Additionally, support can be accessed through the GLBT National Help Center (http://glbtnationalhelpcenter.org/) at 888-843-4564 and NAMI (https://www.nami.org/Your-Journey/Identity-and-Cultural-Dimensions/LGBTQI) provides other online resources.   I hope that you will participate in this research project to help understand the experiences of gender minority individuals. Thank you very much for your time.

    "abstract": "Childhood adversity has been linked to numerous health and mental health concerns in adulthood (Felitti et al., 1998). Among the many outcomes associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), victimization and perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) remains a public health crisis. Research has found that those identifying as gender minority individuals are disproportionately impacted by IPV (Messinger, 2017; Peitzmeier et al., 2020). Further, gender minority individuals experience equivalent, if not higher, rates of ACEs when compared to their cisgender counterparts (Baams, 2018; Juárez-Chávez et al., 2018; Schnarrs et al., 2019; Tobin & Delaney, 2019). While many factors contribute to the pathway from ACEs to IPV, the role of internalized transphobia (IT) in this relation is poorly understood. However, previous research has underscored the role of internalized shame in relation to both ACEs and IPV (Rood et al., 2017; Thaggard & Montayre, 2019; Thomson & Jaque, 2018b). Internalized transphobia may therefore serve as a mediator in the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence. Using a cross-sectional quantitative single administration survey design, this research aimed to better understand the relation between ACEs, IT, and IPV in adults identifying as gender minorities. This study used a mediated regression model to discern if internalized transphobia mediated the relationship between childhood adversity and intimate partner violence. Findings from this research indicated that while internalized transphobia did not mediate the relationship between ACEs and IPV, IT was still predictive of IPV. Endorsement of ACEs also predicted endorsement of IPV",
