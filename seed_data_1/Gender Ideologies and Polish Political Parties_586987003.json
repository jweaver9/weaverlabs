Email: anna.gwiazda@kcl.ac.uk(Received 17 August 2020; revised 11 October 2021; accepted 15 October 2021)AbstractThis article explores the gender dimension of ideology and representation by analysing thepolitical parties that ran in the 2019 Polish parliamentary elections, using a novel analyt-ical framework based on gender claims and gender-related policy pledges. This articledemonstrates that a left and liberal ideology largely determines feminist and pro-LGBTQ+ promissory representation. However, the gender ideologies of right-wing polit-ical parties vary in their traditional types and can include a populist element. This articlecontributes to comparative gender and politics scholarship by examining gender ideolo-gies in the Central and Eastern European context, where on the one hand, populismand anti-gender campaigns have taken hold, and, on the other, feminist and progressivemovements have challenged traditionalism and illiberalism. This article also differentiatesa scholarly meaning of gender ideology from its populist meaning.Keywords: political parties; representation; gender ideology; PolandPolitical parties are agents of gender representation by making gender claims andproposing gender-related policies. In the early 1990s, political parties were ‘themissing variable’ in the gender and politics literature (Baer 1993: 547). Sincethen, a burgeoning literature has examined the relationship between gender andpolitical parties in established democracies (Celis et al. 2016; Espírito-Santo et al.2020; Kittilson 2006, 2013). However, some issues remain unexplored. The needfor research on political parties’ representation of gender in the context of demo-cratic backsliding in Central and Eastern Europe persists. Moreover, existingaccounts of feminized political parties do not accommodate claims arising fromneoconservatism, populism and anti-gender campaigns. Furthermore, scholarshiptends to focus on fulfilling electoral pledges (Thomson et al. 2017) rather than prom-issory representation, that is, claim-making and pledges in electoral campaigns.Consequently, this article is guided by the following research question: how arepolitical parties gendered ideologically? Three sub-questions are proposed: how andwhy do parties make representative claims about women and gender? What areparties’ gender-related policy pledges?

Drawing on representation theory and gender and politicsresearch, this article proposes a new framework to analyse a diversity of claims con-cerning women and gender, and policy pledges made by political parties during anelection campaign. This framework is then tested with reference to Polish politicalparties involved in the 2019 parliamentary elections.Poland is a particularly interesting country in which to investigate this subjectbecause of its political, cultural, historical and gender justice context. Politically,a range of ideologies are represented, although the majority in parliament is heldby the right-wing populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, in power since 2015 andre-elected in 2019. PiS is alleged to have instigated democratic backsliding(Markowski 2020). Culturally, the Catholic Church, which strongly favours trad-itional gender roles, plays a major role in society and politics, and supports PiS.Historically, communism advocated women’s education, employment and abortionrights but severely limited their political rights. In terms of gender justice, women’srights and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) rights have wor-sened since PiS rose to power. In 2019, Poland ranked 24th in the EU on theGender Equality Index (EIGE 2019) and was the second worst in its measure ofLGBTQ+ equality laws and policies (ILGA Europe 2019).This article makes an important contribution to the scholarly literature in severalways. First, by adopting a ‘thick’ conception of gender understood in binary andnonbinary terms, the analytical framework not only considers the heterogeneityof women’s interests but also contributes an LGBTQ+ dimension and gender-related policies. The work also differentiates a scholarly understanding of genderideology as a set of ideas, attitudes and views on gender that provide a foundationfor gender-related policies from its populist understanding as a threat to the trad-itional family and conservative values. Second, the article demonstrates that aparty’s ideology and representation of gender is not straightforward and requiresdetailed qualitative analysis to uncover complexities and a more nuanced under-standing of how parties accommodate different sorts of claims. By examiningPolish political parties, this article discerns diverse gender ideologies, including apopulist element. Third, the article’s focus on political representation during anelectoral campaign – of what Jane Mansbridge (2003) calls promissory representa-tion – highlights parties’ commitment to fulfil election pledges, but little is knownabout how claims and pledges are made. Hence, this study will address this gap.Literature reviewIdeology affects the representation of women (Campbell and Erzeel 2018; Celiset al. 2016; Kittilson 2013; Paxton and Kunovich 2003) and LGBTQ+ people(Brettschneider et al. 2017). Research shows that leftist parties advocate egalitarianbeliefs and are known for their greater support for gender equality and affirmativeaction (Caul 1999). Since the left endorses equality, it has favoured marginalizedgroups, including women and LGBTQ+ people. Left-wing parties tend to nominatemore female candidates than right-wing parties (Krook and Childs 2010;Lovenduski and Norris 1993; Stockemer 2007) and exhibit higher levels of substan-tive representation of feminist interests (Erzeel and Celis 2016). Andrew Reynolds2 Anna Gwiazdahttps://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2021.57Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 2.121.133.88, on 20 Dec 2021 at 12:50:50, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms.(2013) shows that social democratic, socialist, communist and green parties havemore LGBTQ+ MPs than other parties.Previous studies have demonstrated that conservatism entails gendered claims(Celis and Childs 2014), weak equality policies (Celis and Childs 2018) and low pol-itical representation of women (Lovenduski and Norris 1993). However, scholarsare now highlighting advances made by right-wing parties in Western Europe toinclude women (Kittilson 2013; Shames et al. 2020) and demonstrate that laissez-faire conservatism can be compatible with liberal feminism (Campbell and Erzeel2018; Celis and Childs 2014, 2018; Erzeel et al. 2014). Moreover, Reynolds(2013) argues that in the UK a growing number of openly gay MPs have comefrom the Conservative Party.Research on gender and agrarian parties is limited. Since traditional morality isat the core of their ideology, one could expect them to support gender traditional-ism. In the past, rural parties included, on average, more women than left socialistparties (Caul 1999).Initial research on far-right parties has demonstrated that such parties send nowomen to parliament (Caul 1999). Recent studies, however, show that women’spolitical representation has improved, and despite advocating for the traditionalfamily, they also support gender equality (Mudde and Kaltwasser 2015).Although far-right populist parties have selected women party leaders, they alsodisplay signs of toxic masculinity (Daddow and Hertner 2021), and it is notclear whether such parties exhibit a ‘genderedness that is very similar to the onefound across right-wing party families’ (Spierings et al. 2015: 6).However, there is a need for more detailed research on gender ideologies at elec-tion times. Hence, the importance of promissory representation needs to be high-lighted. Promissory representation is a type of representation in which voterschoose and assess potential representatives based on the promises they make duringelection campaigns, which they then keep or fail to keep (Mansbridge 2003). Thestudy of promissory representation, however, tends to focus on pledge fulfilment(Thomson 2017). Less is known about how and why gender claims and pledgesare made by political parties.Moreover, in Central and Eastern Europe, it is important to understand howdemocratic backsliding affects ideology and representation. Scholars argue that illi-beralism and rising authoritarian populism endorse anti-feminist and anti-genderrhetoric (Korolczuk and Graff 2018). ‘Gender ideology’ is used as a catchall term byright-wing and far-right parties to imply that a gay- and feminist-led transnationalmovement is threatening the traditional family and conservative values, and is usedto justify discrimination against women and LGBTQ+ people (Toldy and Garraio2020). PiS’s electoral victory contributed to the intensification of the ‘culture war’discourse and the strengthening of new anti-gender initiatives (Korolczuk 2020).Moreover, the rise of neoconservatism raises questions about gendered representa-tion (Gwiazda 2021).Finally, existing research tends to analyse gender and political parties by focusingon women. Lisa Young (2000) offers a feminist responsiveness framework thatexamines responses by political parties to feminist movements’ demands andassesses parties’ feminist credentials by considering representational and policyresponsiveness. Sarah Childs (2013) proposes a feminization framework thatGovernment and Opposition 3https://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2021.57Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 2.121.133.88, on 20 Dec 2021 at 12:50:50, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms.examines the nature of a feminized political party by assessing women parliamen-tary elites, women party members and women’s concerns. Rosie Campbell andSylvia Erzeel (2018) discuss a gender ideology from a feminist perspective and sub-sequently propose traditional and feminist gender ideologies. However, theseapproaches are narrow in scope. Instead, there is a need to go beyond a feministunderstanding and examine a diversity of claims, including non-feminist andLGBTQ+ claims, and a variety of gender-related policies. Consequently, a morecomprehensive framework based on a ‘thick’ conception of gender is proposedbelow.The conceptual and analytical frameworkGender in political science scholarship is diversely conceptualized. Karen Beckwith(2005) acknowledges that definitions of gender range from a simple synonym forsex to culturally specific dynamic interactions. Johanna Kantola andEmanuela Lombardo (2017) suggest the need to study gender first as a complexsocially constructed relation between masculinities and femininities and genderroles and norms; subsequently, analytical focus should shift away from biologicalsex, which treats men and women as binary opposites, to gender identities.Mary Hawkesworth (2013: 47) proposes that gender as an analytic category neces-sitates ‘interrogations about the ways in which power operates to produce sex, gen-der and sexuality within specific racial, ethnic and national contexts’.Consequently, this article argues that a ‘thin’ understanding of gender (as sex inbinary terms) can be distinguished from its ‘thick’ understanding (in binary andnonbinary terms). This article uses a ‘thick’ understanding of gender to allow theinclusion of historically marginalized groups – that is, women and LGBTQ+ peo-ple. The need for research on women and politics persists (Beckwith 2005) and thefocus on LGBTQ+ people highlights sexual and gender diversity and justice(Brettschneider et al. 2017).This article draws on Michael Freeden’s (2001: 7174) definition of politicalideology as a ‘set of ideas, beliefs, values, and opinions’ that provides ‘plans ofaction for public policy making’. Consequently, the study of claims (ideas) and pol-icies is required. Michael Saward (2010) views claim-making as the core ofrepresentation and emphasizes how diverse and complex a representative claimcan be. Karen Celis et al. (2014) adopt a representative claim approach to studyclaim-making for women and women’s issues (policies). If promissory representa-tion is considered, then instead of policies, pledges need to be examined. Electionpledges are commitments made through parties’ programmes to implement certainpolicies (Thomson 2017).Consequently, to analyse party ideology systematically and to discern genderideologies specifically, gender claims and gender-related policies are considered.Table 1 presents a gender ideology framework for analysis.In addition to claims defined in Table 1, ideology is concerned with gender-related policies. This term is used to encompass both gender equality policiesand gender-related policies that continue to uphold inequalities. First, genderequality policies denote feminist and LGBTQ+ policies. Feminist policies are con-cerned with improving women’s rights, reducing gender-based hierarchies and4 Anna Gwiazdahttps://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2021.57Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Genderedclaims refer to traditional gender roles. Agender role is ‘a set of prescriptive,culture-specific expectations about whatis appropriate for men and women’(Hawkesworth 2013: 40). Gender roles areproduced through a complex sociallyconstructed relation betweenmasculinities and femininities. Theseclaims emphasize traditional women’sroles as mothers and care-givers and aimto improve women’s lives within thesetraditional terms (Celis and Childs 2014).Women are viewed through the prism offamily and motherhood (Gwiazda 2021).SociallyconservativeModerate genderedclaimsSupport for women’s policieswith gendered content.Reluctant to support feministpolicies; some exceptions arepossible.Ultra-conservative Extreme gendered claims Opposing feminist policies, inparticular abortion andpolicies against domesticviolencePro-LGBTQ+ claims Endorse the existence of multiple genderand sexual identities, and gender justicefor all.

Policieson reproductive rights, combating domestic violence or addressing the gender paygap are examples. Conversely, LGBTQ+ policies are equality laws that focus on sex-ual orientation and gender identity, and are progressive because they treat all citi-zens equally (Reynolds 2013). Policies providing for same-sex marriage, adoptionand transgender rights are examples. Second, anti-gender policies (includinganti-LGBTQ+ policies) contest gender-related issues, gender identities and com-plexities, hinder gender awareness and either present the concept of gender pejora-tively or reject it completely (Gwiazda 2020). Finally, policies that relate to womenbut do not have the specific objective of enhancing gender equality can be discussedwithin the scope of women’s policies with gendered content (Gwiazda 2021).Claims are linked to gender-related policies. There is an expectation that feministclaims are congruent with feminist policies. Gendered claims can be congruent withwomen’s policies with gendered content. Pro-LGBTQ+ claims are consistent withLGBTQ+ policies. Anti-LGBTQ+ claims are consistent with anti-gender policies.The analysis of gender claims and gender-related policies facilitates the identifica-tion of gender ideology. For Shannon Davis and Theodore Greenstein (2009), genderideologies are defined as views that people hold regarding gender roles in terms of adivision of paid work and family responsibilities. Susan Philips (2001) argues that thestudy of gender ideologies is concerned with understanding differences in humanviews on women, men and alternative gender identities. Instead, I define a genderideology as a set of ideas, attitudes and views on gender that constitute the foundationfor gender-related policies. I propose to study a gender ideology as a gender dimensionof political ideology using a ‘thick’ understanding of gender in its binary and nonbin-ary forms. This scholarly definition differs from a populist understanding of ‘genderideology’ (in inverted commas), which is used by populists to denote a threat to trad-itionalism, conservative values and national identity.Gender ideologies can be classified as traditional or egalitarian (Davis andGreenstein 2009). In this article, traditional gender ideologies uphold traditionalgender roles and a binary understanding of gender. Such views can result in anyof the following: gendered claims, anti-LGBTQ+ claims, women’s policies of gen-dered nature and anti-gender policies. Conversely, egalitarian gender ideologiesendorse progressive gender roles and a nonbinary understanding of genderwhich encompasses alternative sexual identities and gender identities. Such viewscan result in any of the following: feminist claims, pro-LGBTQ+ claims, feministpolicies and LGBTQ+ policies.This analytical framework has several advantages. It is sensitive to the heterogen-eity of women and gender and moves beyond the narrow feminist perspective.Moreover, this approach emphasizes the representative’s role (in this case, politicalparties) in creating and framing claims and proposing policy actions. This frame-work is used for promissory representation but can also be applied to substantiverepresentation.MethodologyThe advantage of using qualitative single-country studies is that they are moreintensive and in-depth because they focus on particular features of a countryGovernment and Opposition 7https://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2021.57Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

In this article, a single-country study generates infer-ences about the gender ideologies of political parties.This in-depth study is based on primary and secondary data. Primary sourcesinclude party manifestos and leaders’ statements made during the 2019electoral campaign. Party manifestos were available on parties’ websites whereasleaders’ statements were taken from online sources: Polish Radio, YouTubeand broadsheet newspapers such as Gazeta Wyborcza, Gazeta Prawna andRzeczpospolita. Primary data were analysed using content analysis. A qualitativecontent analysis ascribes meaning to text or verbal data through its interpretationby a researcher (Schreier 2012). Margrit Schreier (2012) also clarifies that themain categories of a coding frame used in qualitative content analysis are theaspects on which the study focuses. In this article, the main categories are iden-tified in Table 1. In addition, words such as women, mother and family werelooked for specifically.Five principal manifestos were examined. Moreover, several leaders’ statementsconcerning gender-related matters were selected. Content analysis involved exam-ining keywords (concepts) and themes (pledges) in manifestos and speeches. Theauthor’s knowledge of the Polish language was indispensable since written and ver-bal texts were in Polish. Both conceptual and relational analyses were used to iden-tify gender ideologies (Le Navenec and Hirst 2010). Conceptual analysis determinesthe existence and frequency of specific concepts in a text. Relational analysis exam-ines the relationships among concepts and themes, in this case, the relationshipbetween claims and pledges.Secondary sources included the scholarly literature and reports published byinternational agencies. The European Institute for Gender Equality and theInternational Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) pub-lish reports on women’s empowerment and LGBTQ+ people in Europe, respect-ively. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reporthighlighted problematic aspects of the 2019 elections in Poland. Finally, theInstitute of Public Affairs is a Polish research institute publishing regular reportson women in politics.PolandTable 2 presents the 13 October 2019 election results.1 PiS was re-elected for asecond term, securing 43.6% of the votes. The main opposition, the CivicCoalition, led by the liberal-centrist Civic Platform, won 27.4% of the votes. TheDemocratic Left Alliance (the Left) returned to parliament after a four-year absenceand finished third with 12.6% of the votes. The Polish Peasant Party secured 8.6%of the votes. Finally, a new entrant, the far-right Confederation, received 6.8% of thevotes. All five electoral committees, although formally registered as single parties,were de facto party coalitions (Markowski 2020).In the Senate, PiS won 48 of 100 seats, the same number as the Civic Coalition(43), the Polish Peasant Party (3) and the Left (2) combined, which concluded apre-election pact not to run candidates against each other to secure a win overPiS. Three of four independents were elected with opposition support.8 Anna Gwiazdahttps://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2021.57Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The PiS electoral list also included candidates from twosmall parties: Solidarity Poland (Solidarna Polska) and the Agreement(Porozumienie). They have 18 deputies and 2 senators each. PiS promotes socialconservatism in economic and moral spheres and advocates social transfers andstate intervention in the economy, and traditional values and morality derivedfrom the teachings of the Catholic Church. The party’s national conservatism con-nects national traditions and identity with Catholicism. The party’s populismclearly identifies enemies and is illiberal in essence (Gwiazda 2020). In power,PiS has been accused of repeatedly violating constitutional norms, dismantlingchecks and balances, infringing judicial independence, parliamentary proceduresand citizens’ rights and controlling public media (Markowski 2020).The 2019 PiS manifesto contains claims and policy pledges concerning women.It refers to women 34 times, mothers 5 times and the family 124 times. The partyclaims it takes care of ‘the proper position of women in society’ but views womenequivocally. On the one hand, its socially conservative focus on the traditional fam-ily is apparent by endorsing a ‘Family first’ slogan. According to PiS, a familyincludes a union of a man and a woman, which forms the foundation of sociallife and should be protected from ‘gender ideology’ (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość2019). PiS provides extended childcare benefits (the Family 500+ programme)and pension benefits for mothers who never worked or gave up working to raisefour or more children (Mama 4+). Women are seen as mothers and part of thetraditional family; hence gendered claims are promoted. Moreover, PiS opposes‘eugenics and abortion on demand’ (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość 2019).On the other hand, PiS also endorses conservative feminist claims. The party’smanifesto stipulates: ‘Men and women are different, but it cannot justify a genderpay gap. That is why we will put forward proposals to address inequality in theworkplace’ (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość 2019). Addressing the gender pay gap is itsnew pledge. The manifesto also mentions improving women’s opportunities inpromotion and recruitment and reconciling work with childcare. The ‘genderequality in the workplace’ section covers almost three pages of the 232-pagemanifesto.PiS interprets gender in binary and populist terms. During the election conven-tion, party leader Jarosław Kaczyński said, ‘We object to same-sex unions, theirmarriage, and their right to adopt children.’ Then he added, ‘there are only twosexes: women and men’ (Kaczyński 2019). This binary view of gender endorsesanti-LGBTQ+ claims and policies, which is combined with a populist claim. PiSpromises to ‘stop the spread of “gender ideology” because its impact is growing,especially among young people, and contributes to the growth of unfavourable atti-tudes towards the traditional family and having children’ (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość2019). PiS supported an anti-gender citizens’ legislative initiative to ban sex educa-tion because ‘it introduces “gender ideology” and LGBT rights’ (Gwiazda 2020).‘Gender ideology’ is mentioned twice in the manifesto.These claims were widely propagated in public media. PiS turned public mediainto a partisan propaganda machine, which is an element of democratic backsliding10 Anna Gwiazdahttps://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2021.57Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

This allowed PiS to control the public discourse during theelectoral campaign and exclusively promote its own claims and policy pledges.Overall, PiS voices gendered claims that advocate the preservation of traditionalfamily and gender roles, a conservative feminist claim promoting gender equality inemployment and anti-LGBTQ+ claims questioning the existence of gender and sex-ual identities. PiS promises to improve women’s situation in the workplace andimplement women’s policies (childcare benefits) but opposes LGBTQ+ policiesand abortion on demand. PiS’s control of public media entails the monopolizationof its gender ideology.The Civic Coalition (Koalicja Obywatelska, KO)The Civic Coalition (KO) is composed of the Civic Platform, the Modern Party, theGreen Party and the Polish Initiative (having 119, 8, 3 and 4 deputies in the Sejm,respectively). The Civic Platform is a centrist liberal party. Established in 2001 as aliberal conservative party, it was in government from 2007 to 2015. It holds largelyliberal views on the economy and social and moral issues (although there is also a con-servative faction). The Modern Party, established in 2015, is a liberal party promoting,among other things, women’s rights. The Green Party established in 2003 won its firstseats in parliament in 2019.2 Finally, the Polish Initiative is a minor leftist party.The KO’s manifesto makes several feminist claims and policy pledges. Womenare mentioned 25 times in a 136-page manifesto which also includes a special sec-tion entitled ‘Women’s Rights’. It encompasses: protection against different types ofdomestic violence; support for women in securing child alimony; state funding forin vitro fertilization; free anaesthesia during childbirth; full access to prenatal testsand perinatal care; sex education in schools; accessible and reimbursed contracep-tion; gender pay gap elimination; pension gap elimination; protection againstlabour market discrimination and promotion of female progression in the work-place; introduction of gender quotas for middle and senior management positionsin state institutions and state-owned companies; reconciling work and family life;increasing the number of places in nurseries; and the introduction of two-monthpaternity leave (Koalicja Obywatelska 2019). One leader of the Civic Platformhas also confirmed that the Family 500+ programme would be continued(Schetyna 2019). Because this policy pledge is discussed in combination withaffordable public nurseries, this claim is socially feminist. The KO supports modernegalitarian families with an equal division of caring responsibilities between part-ners (Koalicja Obywatelska 2019).Regarding other aspects of gender, the KO has called in the manifesto for legalrecognition of civil partnerships for heterosexual and homosexual couples.Moreover, the mayor of Warsaw (from the Civic Platform) signed a declarationprotecting LGBTQ+ rights. The KO is moderately LGBTQ+ progressive and doesnot openly support same-sex marriage and adoption.Overall, the KO represents liberal and social feminist claims and supports fem-inist policies. Furthermore, it is moderately LGBTQ+ progressive.The Democratic Left Alliance (Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej, SLD)The Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), also called the Left, ran as a party coalition ofthe Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), Spring (Wiosna) and Together (Razem),Government and Opposition 11https://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2021.57Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 2.121.133.88, on 20 Dec 2021 at 12:50:50, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms.gaining 24, 19 and 6 seats in the Sejm, respectively. The SLD was established in1991 as the direct successor to the Communist Party, but over time it became amodern social democratic party. Liberal-left Spring, founded in February 2019, isled by LGBTQ+ campaigner Robert Biedroń, currently an MEP and the first openlygay politician in Poland. The radical left, Together, formed in 2015, has promotedsocial justice for women and minorities and protested against restricting abortionrights.The Left offers a broad leftist programme addressing issues ranging from socialistconcerns about unemployment, the rising cost of living and taxation, to environmen-tal concerns (energy and climate issues) and sociocultural progressive policies con-cerning abortion, and gay and women’s rights (Markowski 2020). The femaleleaders of the Left called on the opposition to support the ten-point ‘Pact forWomen’ which inter alia addressed domestic violence, in vitro public funding, abor-tion and sex education. The Left has the highest proportion of women in its ranks inthe Sejm (43%). The 19-page election manifesto mentions women five times andincludes a separate ‘Women’s Rights’ section which covers: (1) abortion liberalization;(2) reimbursement of contraception and (3) gender parity in central and local gov-ernments and state companies (Lewica 2019). Moreover, the manifesto calls forfull reimbursement of in vitro fertilization, addressing the gender pay gap, sex edu-cation and a free nursery place for every child. The manifesto also highlights socialrights that promote social inclusion and social solidarity.Regarding LGBTQ+ issues, the main pledges are to introduce ‘marital equalityfor all’ and ‘sex education in schools’ (Lewica 2019). They derive from Spring’sfive proposals for LGBTQ+ people, including: legalization of civil partnerships;legalization of same-sex marriages; amendment of the Criminal Code to includehate crimes motivated by the victim’s sexuality; changes to gender recognitionlaw; and sex education (Gazeta Prawna 2019). The Left has three openly gay dep-uties. A leader of Spring has also defended women’s rights, saying, ‘There is noequality without equality for women. Democracy without women is half democ-racy’ (Biedroń 2019).Overall, the Left represents social and liberal feminist claims and is highlyLGBTQ+ progressive. The Left wholeheartedly supports gender equality polices.The Polish Peasant Party (Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe, PSL)The Polish Peasant Party (PSL) aligned with Kukiz’15 under the label of the ‘PolishCoalition’, yet formally registered as the PSL for the 2019 election, gained 30 seats(including five seats for Kukiz’15). With roots in the pre-war period, the PSL is anagrarian party, established in 1990, and has been present in parliament since then.It has played a pivotal ‘kingmaker’ role, joining several post-1989 governments(Markowski 2020). Kukiz’15 is an anti-establishment party founded by a rock musi-cian in 2015.The PSL manifesto makes no explicit references to women or LGBTQ+ people.However, it has been argued that some of the party’s proposals support women: forexample, voluntary social insurance contributions for micro-entrepreneurs (whotend to be women because of the need to combine work with childcare) and anhour for the family (which shortens worktime by an hour for parents of childrenunder the age of 10) (Druciarek et al. 2019).12 Anna Gwiazdahttps://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2021.57Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 2.121.133.88, on 20 Dec 2021 at 12:50:50, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms.Although no references are made to women, mothers are mentioned twice andreferences to the family, childcare and elderly care are made that emphasize thetraditional family model. The party supports the Family 500+ programme,free-of-charge crèches and ‘will enable mothers and fathers to combine work andchildcare’ (Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe 2019). In the campaign, the PSL leadersaid he would not support the Left’s ‘Pact for Women’ because it endorses liberal-ization of abortion. Instead the party supported the 1993 law banning abortion(with exceptions) (Kosiniak-Kamysz 2019).Overall, the party supports implicitly gendered claims, seeing women as mothersand part of the traditional family. There is a weak conservative feminist claim con-cerning policy reconciling work and family life. However, the PSL is against the lib-eralization of abortion. There are no LGBTQ+-related claims and policies. In sum,since hardly any explicit gender claims and pledges are made, the PSL can almost beconsidered gender-blind.The Confederation Freedom and Independence (Konfederacja Wolność i Niepodleglość)The Confederation Freedom and Independence is a far-right populist party regis-tered in July 2019, following a coalition agreement between KORWiN and theNational Movement in 2018.3 While the former is ultra-liberal in economicterms and ultra-conservative in social terms, the latter is ultra-nationalist, xenopho-bic and anti-Semitic. The leaders present themselves as defenders of the traditionalfamily, oppose immigration and multiculturalism, and are Eurosceptic althoughthey support unconstrained trade exchange (Markowski 2020). In the 2019 elec-tions, the Confederation gained 11 seats: five for KORWiN, five for the NationalMovement and one secured by the nationalist and traditionalist Crown (Korona),which joined the Confederation before the elections.The Confederation is a men’s party: it has no female deputies in parliament andwomen are not mentioned in its manifesto, which instead shows an image of athree-generational family – including a mother, a father, children and grandparents.The Confederation supports the traditional family model (Druciarek et al. 2019).The Confederation endorses anti-feminist claims and pledges. In an interviewheld before the 2019 elections, a leader of KORWiN said, ‘women are weakerand should earn less so there is no need to address the gender pay gap’(Korwin-Mikke 2019). He had already expressed this opinion at the EuropeanParliament in 2017 (Euronews 2017). This misogynistic claim is completely anti-feminist. The Confederation strongly supports a total abortion ban and withdrawalfrom the Council of Europe Convention (Istanbul Convention) on preventing andcombating violence against women and domestic violence. The Convention is seenas being at odds with Catholic values and the traditional family and, according tothe Confederation, could lead to teaching Polish schoolchildren about non-traditional gender identities.Regarding LGBTQ+ issues, the main populist slogan is ‘Stop LGBT propaganda’,which is used three times in the 20-page manifesto. The Confederation urges itssupporters to ‘defend schools from the invasion of self-proclaimed “sex educators”and propagandists of the LGBT movement and oppose indoctrination and promo-tion of its harmful ideology’ (Konfederacja 2019). In an interview, a leader of theNational Movement warned against ‘an invasion of LGBT ideology which attacksGovernment and Opposition 13https://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2021.57Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The Confederation has proposed the Charter of Polish Families(in response to a declaration promoting LGBTQ+ rights by the mayor ofWarsaw), which calls for the revocation of the Istanbul Convention, a ban on sexeducation, and opposes same-sex marriage and state funding of LGBTQ+ organi-zations (TokFM 2019).Overall, the Confederation voices ultra-conservative claims and opposes feministpolicies. The Confederation’s anti-LGBTQ+ claims are related to anti-LGBTQ+pledges.Concluding discussionThis article has examined how Polish political parties are gendered ideologically.Using a novel analytical framework, it has analysed the gender dimension of pol-itical ideology and discerned political parties’ claims and policy pledges in the2019 electoral campaign. Although leftist and liberal parties endorse feminist andpro-LGBTQ+ promissory representation and right-wing parties largely endorsegendered and anti-LGBTQ+ promissory representation, a detailed analysis showsa more nuanced picture. Specific findings are presented below.First, this article shows that gender ideologies vary in Poland. Table 3 presents asummary. There is a strong correlation between wider political ideology and a typeof gender ideology, but the conventional dichotomy needs to be qualified. Left andcentre parties display egalitarian gender ideologies of two types. Whereas the Left ishighly progressive and opts for all LGBTQ+ policies (Type 1), the KO is moderatelyprogressive and advocates several LGBTQ+ policies (Type 2).Conversely, right-wing parties display traditional gender ideologies of threetypes: Type 1 is mostly traditional and populist; Type 2 is implicit or gender-blind;Type 3 is ultra-traditional and populist. PiS represents Type 1 by making genderedclaims that advocate the preservation of traditional family and gender roles, optingfor women’s policies with gendered content and being reluctant to adopt feministpolicies. It also endorses anti-LGBTQ+ claims and policies. However, it does advo-cate gender equality in employment. Thus, PiS is mostly traditional but with a con-servative feminist claim. It also voices a populist claim – ‘gender ideology’. The PSLrepresents Type 2 because of its implicit gender claims. The Confederation repre-sents Type 3 and supports ultra-conservative gendered claims, anti-feminist andanti-LGBTQ+ claims and opposes feminist policies, specifically those supportingabortion and combating domestic violence. It also uses a populist claim – ‘gender(LGBT) ideology’.A traditional gender ideology is qualified with new specifications. First, a popu-list dimension is identified. Populists consider society to be separated into twoantagonistic groups: supporters and enemies (Mudde 2004). Right-wing populistPiS and the far-right populist Confederation view LGBTQ+ people as enemies.They refer to ‘gender ideology’ as a threat to the traditional family, conservativevalues and national identity. By using ‘gender ideology’, PiS criticizes neoliberalism,while the Confederation ‘combines a desire to maintain a gender hierarchy and hat-red towards “sexual degenerates” with anti-European Union sentiments andIslamophobia’ (Korolczuk 2020: 165).14 Anna Gwiazdahttps://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2021.57Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 2.121.133.88, on 20 Dec 2021 at 12:50:50, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms.Moreover, this article argues that PiS is mostly traditional (rather than fully trad-itional) because it supports a conservative feminist claim. This is somehow surpris-ing given PiS’s social conservatism. The cases of PiS and the PSL illustrate thatconservative parties are now more willing to accept certain gender-equality policiesin the public sphere (employment) but not in the private sphere (abortion).Furthermore, there is a difference between explicit claims (all parties except thePSL) and implicit claims (PSL). While it is expected that explicit claims are closelylinked to pledges, implicit claims and pledges are vague, so a party is more flexiblein terms of endorsing diverse gender-related policies. In fact, the PSL as a coalitiongovernment partner of the Civic Platform supported, for example, gender quotas.Finally, the far-right Confederation is more traditional than its WesternEuropean equivalents and is classified as ultra-traditional.Second, political parties accommodate gender claims and pledges that derivefrom different sources. Egalitarian gender ideology relates to feminist andLGBTQ+ activism over the past decades. Following women’s suffrage in 1918,under communism, women were granted rights to education, employment andabortion. This top-down emancipation and communist control of independentmovements initially hindered women’s political activism during democratic transi-tion (Waylen 1994). The institutionalized feminism of nongovernmental organiza-tions dominated in the early 2000s and is now followed by less formal grassrootsforms of engagement that combine online activism with organizing demonstrationson the ground (Hall 2019). According to Ewa Winnicka (2011), two strands of fem-inism can be discerned: liberal and leftist – the former represented by the liberalCongress of Women (supporting women’s business and political elites), and the lat-ter represented by the Women’s Agreement of 8 March (supporting low-paid, dis-advantaged and marginalized women). The Civic Platform has collaborated withthe Congress of Women, while Left’s Together represents disadvantaged women.Phillip Ayoub and Agnès Chetaille (2020) emphasize that the LGBTQ+ movementborn in the late 1980s was reinvigorated by Poland’s accession to the EuropeanUnion. Its claims were adopted by the Spring party – a member of the Left.Traditional claims and pledges derive from the fact that Poland is a traditionallyconservative country, influenced by the Catholic Church, where the traditional fam-ily plays a central role. Women have been assigned specific gender roles, best char-acterized by the traditional figure of the ‘Polish Mother’, Matka Polka (Hall 2019).The term refers to a woman who has devoted her entire life to her family and toraising children in the spirit of traditional and patriotic values.

Moderately gendered claims are linked tothis cultural and historical legacy. Ultra-conservative claims are closely linked toultra-conservative organizations such as Ordo Iuris and Catholic Radio Maryja.A populist element is related to the Catholic Church’s opposition to ‘genderideology’. Poland’s anti-gender campaigns were initiated in 2012 by the CatholicChurch and ultra-conservative organizations, following the Vatican’s criticism ofgender equality movements as powerful foreign colonizers (Korolczuk 2020;Korolczuk and Graff 2018). In Poland, anti-LGBTQ+ claims have been associatedwith the national tradition, equating Poles with Catholics, and highlighting theincompatibility of LGBTQ+ ideas with Polish culture (Ayoub and Chetaille 2020).PiS’s conservative feminist claim (gender equality in employment) could beattributed to stronger conservative feminist voices and the women’s forum withinthe party (Gwiazda 2020). Yet, the complexity of claims-making can come fromadditional factors. It can result from the need to appeal to different sorts of con-stituencies, intra-party competition or a unilateral decision by the party leader.Future research should investigate these factors.Third, political parties offer different gender ideologies to attract specific con-stituencies. Promissory representation offers a contract between parties and theirconstituents: specific claims and pledges are to secure votes. Traditional genderideology is directed at conservative voters whereas egalitarianism is linked to pro-gressive voters. A sociodemographic profile of the electorate can discern constitu-encies. According to Radoslaw Markowski (2020), the PiS electorate representedalmost two-thirds of the poorly educated, religious and socially conservative voters,older people and those living in rural areas and small towns; the KO was largelysupported by the well educated and those living in big cities; the Left attractedmany voters with a progressive appeal; the PSL appealed to rural voters and mod-erately religious and conservative voters; the Confederation was more than twice aspopular with men than women and attracted the most radical voters from thenationalist conservative camp. The conservative feminist claim is likely be offeredto the section of PiS supporters who have a different sociodemographic profilefrom the core one, but this link needs to be researched further.Finally, the effects of democratic backsliding were visible in two ways: publiciz-ing governing party ideology through the control of state media and prioritizingpopulist and illiberal claims, including anti-gender claims. Although internationalobservers concluded that Polish parliamentary elections were prepared well, theywere concerned about intolerant rhetoric and bias in public media (OSCE 2019).In fact, partisan propaganda aired by the public broadcaster promoted PiS’s claims,including gendered claims and pledges. References to threatening ‘gender ideology’were widespread. Since 2015, PiS has restricted women’s rights and supported‘LGBT-free’ zones (Gwiazda 2020). The 2019 electoral campaign brought intosharp relief PiS’s populist and illiberal claims on public media. Thus, anti-genderclaims and the resistance to gender equality are clearly connected with democraticbacksliding. Andrea Krizsán and Conny Roggeband (2019) argue that the gendereddimensions of democratic backsliding include an assertion that gender equality is avalue externally imposed and hence alien to national traditions and the closure of16 Anna Gwiazdahttps://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2021.57Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Moreover, this article adds that the gendered dimension ofdemocratic backsliding means the substantial exclusion of feminist and progressiveclaims, which compromises the quality of political representation.In conclusion, this article contributes to a better understanding of gender ideolo-gies by utilizing a novel framework to analyse Polish political parties. Moreover, ithighlights the importance of promissory representation and how parties make gen-der claims and gender-related policy pledges. However, electoral promises do notnecessarily result in policy outputs and outcomes. The best test of promissoryrepresentation involves examining ideology in practice, that is, the analysis of sub-stantive representation and policy outputs. Further research should also examineintersectionality and intra-party ideological differences. Finally, future studiesshould gather information on the evolution of claims-making over time and onwho determines claim inclusion in manifestos. In short, more research on gender,ideology and political parties is needed.Acknowledgements.

    "abstract": "This article explores the gender dimension of ideology and representation by analyzing the political parties that ran in the 2019 Polish parliamentary elections, using a novel analytical framework based on gender claims and gender-related policy pledges. This article demonstrates that a left and liberal ideology largely determines feminist and pro-LGBTQ+ promissory representation. However, the gender ideologies of right-wing political parties vary in their traditional types and can include a populist element. This article contributes to comparative gender and politics scholarship by examining gender ideologies in the Central and Eastern European context, where on the one hand, populism and anti-gender campaigns have taken hold, and, on the other, feminist and progressive movements have challenged traditionalism and illiberalism. This article also differentiates a scholarly meaning of gender ideology from its populist meaning",
