Your stories will not be forgotten, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ folks will continue to advocate for our human rights and for justice for our relatives and kin. We are humbled and grateful for the Trans, Non-Binary, and Gender Diverse community members who shared their experiences in the interest of lighting the fire for systemic change.We acknowledge the work of the initial Sub-working group that collectively charted the course for our work.Special thanks are extended to our 2SLGBTQQIA+ circle, Two-Spirit student researchers, Trans and Two-Spirit facilitators who engaged community members nationally. iThis 2SLGBTQQIA+ national action plan was supported through a contribution from the Government of Canada — Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs.2SLGBTQQIA+ Sub Working group membersSylvia Maracle, ChairAlbert BeckMa-Nee ChacabyRaven DavisNanook Fareal GordonRichard JenkinsAlexa KeleutakPercy Lezard Albert McLeodCorrina SparrowElizabeth Irqumia SteinbergJohn R. SylliboyFacilitators Charlotte Nolin Patricia Baxter5PreambleBackground: The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls ( NIMMIWG ) released its final report on June 3, 2019, which included 231 Calls for Justice1. Following the release of the Final Report, the development of a National Action Plan was announced by the Prime Minister. This commitment was a first step toward addressing Call for Justice 1.1, which recommends that the federal, provincial, territorial, and Indigenous governments work together to develop a National Action Plan.  The Government of Canada committed to working together with Indigenous, provincial, and territorial partners on the development of the National Action Plan and to driving transformative change to end systemic racism and violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people. As such, the Core Working Group will be supported by a number of sub-working groups that will support the Core Working Group throughout development of the National Action Plan and its implementation.   We acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of the family and survivors, the core working group, and the various sub-working groups who have supported our work. We are particularly grateful for the strong emphasis by the family and survivors’ working group who directly supported increased efforts to provide public education about 2SLGBTQQIA+ experiences. We also want to thank the Urban Sub-Working Group for their (ongoing) support. We would like to indicate our support for the work done by others and want to make special mention of the Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak who released 62 calls for miskotahâ (change) specific to the Métis Nation in their report Métis Perspectives of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and LGBTQ2S+ People.1  The Final Report also included the Supplementary Report: Quebec, which included 21 Calls for Justice specific to Quebec.ii6The mandate of the NIMMIWG was initially designed to report on all forms of violence perpetrated against Indigenous women and girls in Canada, however Indigenous concepts of gender identity broadened the inquiry’s mission to include Two-Spirit/Indigenous LGBTQ+ people.2 This shift recognized that Indigenous cultures accepted and included diverse concepts of gender and sexuality prior to European colonization. The terms, Two-Spirit and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, and asexual are modern post-contact non-Indigenous constructions that some 2SLGBTQQIA+ people may choose to identify themselves. The Sub-Working Group recognizes there are over 150 known words3 and terms in various Indigenous languages in North America that were used prior to contact to describe people who were gender diverse and LGBTQ+. Additionally, the 2S Sub-Working Group recognizes 2SLGBTQQIA+-specific words and terms that are being reclaimed and introduced as Indigenous languages continue to evolve.We also want to acknowledge that references to 2 Spirit (sexual orientation) and Trans, Non-Binary (gender) are often conflated and lumped together without a nuanced understanding. As such, the Sub-Working Group invites the consideration of gender and sexual orientation as separate experiences. Indigenous peoples are constantly evolving.  As we continue to access and reclaim our Indigenous knowledges through our lands and cultures, we must recognize that our languages are also in a constant state of evolution. The + at the end of 2SLGBTQQIA+ is a way to be inclusive, honor and celebrate how our languages are expanding and offering choices for our sexual and gender diverse relatives to identify. Thus, we also celebrate the diversity of ways our people choose to identify themselves. Nothing about us, without us, is for us!2  Reclaiming Power and Place, The Final Report of the  National Inquiry into Mur-dered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, 2019, Volume 1a, P. 58-59.3  Margaret Robinson (2019) Two-Spirit Identity in a Time of Gender Fluidity, Journal of Homosexuality, DOI: 10.1080/00918369.2019.161385372SLGBTQQIA+  Glossary of Terms The terms ‘Indigenous’ and ‘Indigenous peoples’ in this report will be used to represent all First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples inclusively. ‘Aboriginal’, ‘Native’, and ‘Indian’ are used when reflected in the literature used.  Métis and Inuit when used are specific in reference. 2SLGBTQQIA+ - 2-Spirit (Two-Spirit), lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual. The + where used  denotes the diversity  of remaing identities not covered in  the acronym.Sixties Scoop - A period of time, from 1960 and the mid 1980s4, when Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families by colonial state institutions, or “scooped up” and placed in foster homes, or adopted outside their families, communities, and cultures.Gender and sexually diverse - Gender and sexuality are both wide spectrums. This term is used in place of 2SLGBTQQIA+ people as an umbrella term to note this spectrum of diversity outside of the term Two-Spirit, and is used in addition to Two-Spirit, as not all Indigenous LGBTQQIA+ people identify as Two-Spirit or apply this English language term to identify themselves.Gendercide - Gendercide is the killing of a specific gender group. While this term is generally used to refer to a generalized history of girls and women as being targeted, it also includes trans and non-binary folks. Gendercide has three forms: feticide, infanticide, and gender-based violence. Heteropatriarchy - A colonial social construct that places heterosexual males on top of societal hierarchies in positions of domination.4 Sinclair, R. 2007. Identity lost and found: Lessons from the sixties scoop. https://fn-caringsociety.com/sites/default/files/online-journal/vol3num1/Sinclair_pp65.pdfiii8Indian - The use of “ Indian” in this report denotes the legal term as used in the Indian Act or other historical documents.lndigequeer - Contemporary term that combines Indigenous and queer.Indigiqueer - Contemporary term that is a combination of Indigenous and queer that has replaced the original spelling of “indigequeer”. Millennium Scoop - The Millennium Scoop refers to the seizure of First Nations, Métis and Inuit children since the year 2000. The term was coined by John Beaucage, who wanted to distinguish this from the \"sixties scoop,\" as the children are being placed in foster care. Both provincial and federal data show that there are double as many Aboriginal children in care now than during the Sixties Scoop.5Neocolonialism - The continued exercise of political or economic influence over a society in the absence of formal political control.Two-Spirit - A contemporary pan-Indigenous term used by some Indigenous LGBTQQIA+ people that honours male/female, and other gendered or non-gendered spirits, as well as spiritual and cultural expressions. The term may also be used interchangeably to express one’s sexuality, gender, and spirituality as separate terms for each or together as an interrelated identity that captures the wholeness of their gender and sexuality with their spirituality. Teachings - Traditional Indigenous lessons used to convey culture, messages, and values.Turtle Island - Turtle Island is an Indigenous term to refer to what is now known as the continent of North America. The term originates in the origin stories of Anishinaabeg peoples, but is now widely used by many nations.5 https://www.decolonize-ed.com/single-post/2017/11/07/millenial-scoop9Guiding PrinciplesFoundational principles such as those identified in the National Inquiry’s Final Report may be used to guide the development and implementation of the National Action Plan. The principles outlined by the National Inquiry include:  • A focus on substantive equality and human and Indigenous rights • Leadership of family and survivors is valued• Indigenous-led/grassroots solutions and services• Distinctions-based• A decolonized approach• Cultural safety• Trauma-informed approach• Flexible in response to regional and sectoral priorities and challenges• Evergreen and subject to review and updatesThe following 2SLGBTQQIA+ life-philosophy principles were first introduced at the 28th Annual International Two-Spirit Gathering which was held on August 13-16, 2015 at Batoche, Saskatchewan. After the gathering, 2SLGBTQQIA+ community leaders were consulted and affirmed these principles.  They were later integrated into an organizational manifesto by the Two-Spirited People of Manitoba organization. The 2SLGBTQQIA+ Sub-Working Group also affirms these principles and includes them in these terms of reference. 2SLGBTQQIA+ Specific Guiding Principles6SPIRITUALITY: 2SLGBTQQIA+ people are one of the conduits between the physical world and the spiritual world and can open doors to healing.6  Adapted from TSPM Manifesto, Our Two-Spirit Teachings, Two-Spirited People of Manitoba Inc., 2020. https://twospiritmanitoba.ca/tspm-manifestoiv10BELONGING: 2SLGBTQQIA+ people are worthy of love, respect, and safety. 2SLGBTQQIA+ people carry the responsibility to give love, respect, and safety to everyone.VISIONING: 2SLGBTQQIA+ people see and acknowledge the impact of harmful colonial constructs and work to challenge them within the Two-Spirit community and beyond. The vision and voice of 2SLGBTQQIA+ people must be recognized and integrated into Indigenous leadership structures to ensure inclusive, equitable and fair access to resources and entitlements.TRANSFORMING: 2SLGBTQQIA+ people promote non-discrimination and acceptance by dismantling harmful colonial concepts of gender and sexuality and advocate for contemporary approaches to non-discrimination.EQUALITY: 2SLGBTQQIA+ people challenge the concept of perceived race, ableism, gender, and sex-based privilege within the 2SLGBTQQIA+ collective and the broader community.STRENGTH: 2SLGBTQQIA+ people are assets to their families and communities because of their role, purpose, gifts, and abilities. SEXUALITY: 2SLGBTQQIA+ people are sex-positive, respect the continuum of sexuality,  and believe that relationships, however they are constructed, are enhanced by the celebration of sex. ADVOCACY: 2SLGBTQQIA+ people stand in solidarity with other equity-seeking groups and will assist or support these groups in their advocacy struggles, the civil and human rights of ourselves and others.RESURGENCE: 2SLGBTQQIA+ people assert our inalienable Indigenous rights and work to reclaim our traditional roles and rightful place in our families, communities and nations.

The term Two-Spirit encompasses a broad range of sexual and gender identities of Indigenous peoples across North America and complicates distinctions between gender, sex and sexualities7. While the term is used by some people to refer to the cultural roles of individuals embodying both female and male spirits, the term has also been used as an umbrella term to describe Indigenous people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, queer, intersex and part of the continuum of non-heterosexual identities. It is important to distinguish between gender, sex and sexuality because of the way lesbian, gay and bisexual people are linked with transgender, transsexual people in the 2SLGBTQQIA+ acronym, and in broader queer and Indigenous communities. Prior to contact with European colonizers, Two-Spirit people existed among many Indigenous nations and often held special roles in their communities. There is evidence that in over two-thirds of the 200 Indigenous languages spoken in North America, there were terms used to identify individuals who were neither men nor women.8 Indigenous views on sexuality were not rooted in heteronormativity. Research and oral histories reflect the widespread respect and honour for Two-Spirit people. Within many Indigenous cultures, the roles of Two-Spirit people carried unique responsibilities that were vital to their communities’ well being and survival. Some important roles that Two-Spirit people held were as teachers, knowledge keepers, healers, herbalists, child minders, 7 Sarah Hunt (2016) An Introduction to the Health of Two-Spirit People: Historical, contemporary and emergent issues.

By tracing the relationship between gendered and sexual violence and colonialism, we can start to see how gender and sexuality have been intentionally used by colonizers, settlers, and the Canadian state as a divide and conquer tactic, an instrument of gendercide and genocide, as well as an instrument to exert control over Indigenous peoples and lands.First ContactFrom the time of First Contact by Spanish colonizers in what is now known as middle America and California, Two-Spirit and gender and sexually diverse Indigenous peoples have been subject to exclusion and genocide. In the 16th Century, Spaniards attempted to violently exterminate gender and sexually diverse Indigenous peoples, as under Spanish Law these  ways of being were seen as an affront to the King and Christianity. This served as reason for the continued conquest, brutality, colonization, and forced conversion to Christianity.The acceptance of a spectrum of gender identities outside of male and female genders by Indigenous peoples was seen as inferior by settlers coming to what is now known as Canada. Eventually, this was used as justification in the theft of Indigenous lands, destruction of Indigenous cultures, and genocide, as Indigenous people were seen as subhuman and ignorant by settlers.109 Qwo-Li Driskill (2011) D4Y DβC (Asegi Ayetl): Cherokee Two-Spirit people reimagining nation.

(pp.2-3).https://ro.uow.edu.au/jgi/vol1/iss1/4/  13The establishment of colonial rule was done so by what is termed as “gendercide”: the intentional elimination of Indigenous people who were perceived to be neither fully male nor fully female, or expressed a unique third or other gender, and was done by way of punishment, systematic targeting, and death in order to enforce colonial gender roles and heterosexuality, as well as enact domination over Indigenous peoples.11 Miranda is referring to gendercide by Spanish colonizers among the joyas, though the same notion could be applied to Two-Spirit or Indigenous gender and sexually diverse people in the Canadian context. Europe in the early 16th Century was “intolerant” of sexual freedoms; sexuality was reserved for heteronormative customs like procreation, which carried over to the colonies into the 1600s.12 The American colonies were dominated by these Eurocentric and Christian perspectives that enforced stringent gender binaries and patriarchal practices, beliefs and norms in Latin America.13 Anything that was non-heteronormative of sexuality was considered sodomy, sinful or merely abhorrent to the growing numbers of settler societies. Therefore, Indigenous peoples, who we now refer to as Two-Spirits, would have been branded as perverted or deviant of the settlers’ norms. As Sqilx 2Spirit scholar Percy Lezard continues to remind us, the notion of the “closet” was brought to us by the Europeans who landed on our territories.14Similar colonial influences by English and French settlers impacted the knowledge and cultural belief systems that would have eroded cultural identities with respect to people who may have expressed non-conforming and non-gender identities during the colonial 11  Deborah Miranda (2010).

Leading up to the Indian Act, Indigenous groups were continuously displaced from their cultural beliefs. More rules were implemented into law to marginalize Indigenous groups from their cultural practices and ceremonies. The premise was that Indigenous people were to be controlled in all aspects of governance, law, and land control, which lead to the erasure of their “ceremonies and teachings”.21 The system increased its implementation of more aggressive policies of assimilation, which led to the Indian Act.Two-Spirit knowledge keeper Albert McLeod notes additional impacts of enforced euro-Christian beliefs on spiritual practices of Indigenous peoples, describing how, “The erasure of the Two-Spirit identity and role coincides with the abolition of Indigenous ritual practices, for example the potlatch, dances, pipe ceremony, midwifery, rites of passage, sweat lodge, and Sundance.

The imposition of Euro-Christian beliefs attempted to destroy the spiritual power and energy inherent of these events”.22 Any understanding of Two-Spirit histories, identities and experiences must include how colonization impacted the spiritual: the ways in which traditional Indigenous spiritualities have been impacted by colonial policies and practices, and how these impacts have affected and continue to affect Two-Spirit peoples.Wars and Colonial DependencyMultiple wars between the Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island and European colonists, governments, and settlers were fought from contact until the early 20th Century. While non-Indigenous writings name these events as the First Nations Wars or the American Indian Wars, Indigenous oral traditions —the collective memories of communities— record and remember these events as a time of great loss across many Indigenous Nations. Published settler works outline the impacts these wars had on Indigenous peoples, with negative impacts on population, ways of life, spirituality, culture, disease as well as loss of land accompanied by the Indigenous reservation system. Throughout these wars, early colonizers entered into treaties with many First Nations, establishing a new economic and social paradigm on the northern part of this continent (now referred to as Canada). Some Indigenous leaders saw these treaties as a bridge to a new future but within two years of Cree negotiators concluding the Treaty 6 process, the bison were gone.23 Situated within the new Eurocentric economic paradigm, Indigenous communities were forced to respond to market opportunities such as commercial bison hunting. After years of disruptive hunting, bison populations dwindled and conditions worsened for Indigenous communities. Daschuk explains that, “While extermination of the herds was the greatest environmental catastrophe ever on the grasslands, it also 22 Albert McLeod, Personal Communication, October 3, 2020. 23 James W. Daschuk (2013). Clearing the Plains: Disease, politics of starvation, and the loss of Aboriginal life. Regina, SK: University of Regina Press. p.178.16If we make lasting changes now, our actions will positively affect the lives of current and future 2SLGBTQQIA+ people.brought a fundamental change in the power dynamic between First Nations and Canada. With loss of the bison, Indigenous people lost their independence and power.”24  These losses were soon after followed by famine and disease, with recent studies showing that the rise of tuberculosis in First Nations was, “…the result of enforced changes in ecological factors rather than exposure to a new, introduced infectious disease.” The many Indigenous lives lost throughout the wars and the extermination of the bison are but two examples of the ways in which colonization has acted violently, harming Indigenous peoples. All Indigenous nations experienced depleted access to natural and cultural resources due to settler colonialism and capitalism. This increased Indigenous dependence on inadequate and impoverished colonial rations of food and resources, and denied access to our cultural practices and ways of knowing and being.25 The genocide of Indigenous peoples combined, land dispossession and the reserve system further reinforced colonial gender binaries and compulsive heterosexuality which, in turn, impacted Two-Spirit peoples and histories.Indian ActThe Indian Act of 1876 enshrined the exclusion, erasure and thereby genocide and gendercide of Two-Spirit and gender and sexually diverse Indigenous people. Cannon makes the connection of the inter-relationship of racism, heteropatriarchy, assimilation and capitalism that allowed Canada to not only “civilize” Indigenous people, but also to historically and continuously enforce heterosexuality, male-female colonial gender binaries, and Eurocentric policy and value systems.26The following passage from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (NIMMIWG) in relation to the Indian Act succinctly explains and summarizes the effects of 24 James W. Daschuk (2013). Clearing the Plains: Disease, politics of starvation, and the loss of Aboriginal life. p.183-184.25 Corrina Sparrow, Personal Communication, November 2020.26 Martin Cannon. (1998). The Regulation of First Nations Sexuality. The Canadian Journal of Native Studies 18(1), p.8.. York University: Ontario Canada.17the Act on Indigenous peoples, and MMIWG 2SLGBTQQIA+. This passage can be used to highlight how this policy factors in to the Two-Spirit and gender and sexually diverse Indigenous experience:“The Indian Act creates marginalization, alienation, displacement, and isolation of Indigenous Peoples. This is because the Indian Act is an ongoing tool of oppression and genocide that clearly aims to eliminate Indigenous Peoples. As a legal instrument, it puts into law the false assumptions, discriminatory practices, and colonial and genocidal policies that the Canadian government historically used to clear Indigenous Peoples’ lands, and to control and eliminate Indigenous Peoples and their cultures. Its continued existence perpetuates racial and gendered violence. Regardless of amendments or improvements to “Indian” policy and law, the very existence of the Indian Act demonstrates racism, sexism, and a refusal to move toward self-determination for Indigenous Peoples. As a result, the Indian Act cultivates - and exposes First Nations women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people to - more violence.”27Indian Residential Schools and Loss of LanguageIndian Residential Schools (IRS) were a systematic wholesale attempt to destroy Indigenous cultures and to assimilate Indigenous peoples into the larger Christian Eurocentric society of Canada. Religious orders as well as the government believed Indigenous people to be barbaric and in need of reforming or saving. Rigid views on gender, sexuality and gender roles meant that Two-Spirit and gender and sexually diverse children would have to choose either male or female gender and adhere to strict gender roles and heterosexuality being enforced upon them, or repress those parts of themselves.Some Two-Spirit children chose to go into hiding in order to survive and avoid worse abuse from priests, nuns, and staff. Two-Spirit Elder, Laurie McDonald explains that his experiences in IRS were unique because he is Two-Spirit, and also that Two-Spirit children experienced intensified abuse than that of their non Two-Spirit peers. While attending IRS, he describes a dichotomy of being 27 NIMMIWG. (2019). Reclaiming power and place: The final report of the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. (p.408).18once celebrated and accepted by family, to shame and hiding his Two-Spirit identity while in IRS, out of fear of extreme abuse, and being preyed upon.28 Laurie’s experience bears similarities to other Two-Spirit IRS survivors. In the TRC final report, suicide, targeting, and vulnerability are listed in the testimony and experiences of a Two-Spirit survivor that attended IRS in Hobbema, Alberta.29IRS also played a significant role in the loss of language among Indigenous peoples across Turtle Island, due to the fact that children were barred from speaking their first languages. Children that spoke their first language while at IRS were often met with severe punishment and abuse for doing so, further reinforcing the fear of speaking one’s mother-tongue and losing their language in the process.Within Indigenous cultures most knowledge is conveyed through orality and story-telling. Indigenous cultures are rich in tradition, stories, songs, and teachings, and have been passed down since time immemorial, over many generations. Due to colonization and IRS, this tradition has been decimated over the past two hundred years. According to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in (2012), loss of language in IRS continued as far as post-World War II into the 1960s, and has impacted many Indigenous people and families across multiple generations.30Robinson further identifies other state mechanisms of assimilation, and destruction of Indigenous culture and identity. These include state sanctioned apprehension of Indigenous children from their families, and their placement into non-Indigenous foster or adoptive homes via the colonial child welfare system. This state apprehension 28 Xtra Magazine. (2014, November 5). Residential schools’ impact on Two-Spirit people. [Video].

The placement of Indigenous peoples into Eurocentric culture and systems that are not their own from a young age, as well as their forced conversion to Christianity has caused traditional Indigenous gender systems roles, and cultural knowledge to be lost. Language loss has severely impacted, or entirely wiped out traditional Indigenous understandings of gender, sexuality, and worldviews more broadly.31Neo-colonialism, on-going colonizationThe loss of Indigenous language, traditional knowledge and teachings throughout colonization have had deep and long-lasting impacts for Two-Spirit people. The Indian Act, colonization, residential schools, the Indian Wars, and slaughter of the bison  are all factors in the genocide and harm of Indigenous peoples, and Two-Spirit and gender and sexually diverse Indigenous peoples. These events have led to neocolonialism; a new form of colonialism where the tools used specifically harm Two-Spirit community members;  both on reserves and beyond that pervade into the present. The language and knowledge loss previously named, combined with colonized Indigenous people on and off reserves, results in Two-Spirit and gender and sexually diverse Indigenous people experiencing harms by their own peoples and communities. The concerns about mental health and wellness is an ongoing concern in Indigenous communities where there are increasing numbers of suicide and suicide ideation. According to the Assembly of First Nations32, Two-Spirited youth suffer social oppression and homophobia due to a lack of cultural acceptance and negative cultural identity because of their gender/sexuality.33Driskill (2016) highlights how, “Throughout numerous European 31 Margaret Robinson.

Canadian AIDS Society.20invasions, Indigenous nations and bodies are written of always in relationship to heteropatriarchal colonization as either complicit with, or hostile toward, colonial goals.”34 The gendered and sexualized process of colonization described here characterizes Indigenous peoples though dominant European gender frameworks which Driskill argues places Indigenous peoples at greater risk of colonization.35 The results from this process have seen Two-Spirit and gender and sexually diverse Indigenous people shut out of ceremony, had their gender or sexuality policed and discriminated against, ejected from communities, disowned, and subject to physical harm as a result. It is however important to note that not all Indigenous communities embraced homophobia towards Two-Spirit and gender and sexually diverse people.Leanne Betasamosake Simpson describes this phenomenon and the interplay of the Indian Act, colonization, and heteropatriarchy on Two-Spirit and gender and sexually diverse and Indigenous people:“Heteropatriarchy places cis-gender heterosexual men and their bodies, their politics and their ideas at the top of the social hierarchy. It then normalizes and replicates this hierarchy in all aspects of Indigenous societies, especially in our most intimate spaces - in ceremony, in our relationships, in our families. This is supported and maintained by the state through the Indian Act, Indian policy and the infiltration of Indigenous thoughts systems as a key mechanism to destroy the building blocks of Indigenous political systems and replaces them with the building blocks of state nationalism, capitalism and settler subjectivity.”3634 Qwo-Li Driskill.

(C2C, 2019, p. 4) Alex Wilson (she/her), Neyonawak Inniniwak, Opaskwayak Cree Nation, writes about how, “Traditionally, Two-Spirit people were simply a part of the entire community; as we reclaim our identity with this name, we are returning to our communities.” (Wilson, 1996, p. 305)19th century: Travel accounts and missionary dictionaries formally introduce the word “berdache”, a misinterpretation of Two-Spirit peoples which has been defined as an, “…effeminate or morphological male who does not fill a society’s standard man’s role, who has a non-masculine character.” (Wilson, 1996, p. 304)1830: John Tanner (he/him) a white American living in the Great Lakes and Red River regions, writes about an encounter with an Ojibwe community member, a person who, “…was one of those who make themselves women (…) They are commonly called A-go-kwa…” (Tanner, 1830, p. 105) 1865: Edwin Arthur Watkins (he/him),  published ‘A Dictionary of the Cree Language’ lists the word ayākwāo, defining it as, “a castrated animal, a hermaphrodite”. (Watkins, 1865, p. 195) 1874: Albert Lacombe (he/him), a French missionary, published ‘Dictionnaire de la langue des Cris’ in which the word ayekkwe is recorded as meaning a person who is castrated, and also neither male nor female.1990: Elder Myra Laramee shared the name Two-Spirit at the Annual Native American Gay and Lesbian Gathering in Winnipeg (1994) which as been defined as: “…an Indigenously-defined pan-Native North American term that refers to the diversity of Aboriginal LGBTQ identities as well as culturally-specific non-binary gender identities.” (Hunt, S., 2016, p. 7)222We have to  braid  our past with our present to make a strong future to stop violence for 2SLGBTQQIA.1996: Alex Wilson (she/her), Neyonawak Inniniwak, Opaskwayak Cree Nation, described Two-Spirit people as being born ‘in balance’, “…which may be understood as androgyny, a balance of masculine and feminine qualitities, of male and female spirits.” (1996, p. 305)2004: Thirza Cuthand (she/her), Plains Cree and Scots descent, Little Pine First Nation, introduces the term ‘Indigequeer’ in a title an Indigenous/Two-Spirit program within the Vancouver Queer Film Festival. She used it because, “… some LGBTQ Indigenous people don’t feel as comfortable with the Two-Spirit titled because it implies some dual gender stuff, which some people just don’t feel describes their identity.” (Cuthand, 2017)2015: TRC’s Volume 5 (Canada’s Residential Schools: The Legacy), Chapter 4 (“An Attack on Aboriginal Health: The Marks and the Memories”) discusses Two-Spiritness, describing, “Aboriginal people traditionally celebrated people who were gay or transgender as gifted, as being ‘TwoSpirits’. The residential schools had particular impacts upon TwoSpirited people, who faced numerous attacks on their identities” (TRC, 2015c, p. 148)2016: Qwo-Li Driskill (s/he), (non-citizen) Cherokee Two-Spirit, describes the concept of udanto which refers to people who either fall outside of men’s and women’s roles or who mix men’s and women’s roles. Also described is the concept of asegi, translated as ‘strange’ and understood by some Cherokees to resemble the English word ‘queer’. (Driskill, 2016, p. 6)2017: Joshua Whitehead (he/him), Oji-Cree, Peguis First Nation, describes his sexual identity as a ‘braiding of two worlds’ — “…this queerness and his culture and his way of making a space, land, and ceremony for that identity.” (CBC, 2017) He also frames the name Indigiqueerness as the “…forward moving momentum for Two-Spiritness.” (CBC, 2017) 23MethodologyIntersectionality bringing Two-Spirit relatives  and kin back into the circleAmerican civil rights advocate Kimberlé Crenshaw first used the term “intersectionality” in the late 1980s. While there are different definitions of “intersectionality,” for Indigenous Peoples, definitions have evolved to reflect their unique learnings and experiences. In its broadest terms, intersectionality takes into account the impact of diverse factors such as race, class, sex, gender, residency, geography, ability and age as they apply to an individual or group. It also helps to develop a broader understanding of complex systems of discrimination and disadvantage. This understanding can support the development of policies tailored to the needs of those who experience discrimination. The combination of different systems of oppression against Indigenous women and girls, and including the particular issues faced by 2SLGBTQQIA+ people in some Indigenous communities, can show us how systems, institutions, and individual actions further target individuals in other areas, including homelessness, poverty, and other circumstances that increase the dangers they may face.37 The relationship between Intersectionality and Indigeneity has also been documented by Sarah Hunt (Kwagiulth, Kwakwaka’wakw Nation) in a dialogue held in April 2012, on Coast Salish Territories. Hunt documents that Indigenous knowledges allow for diverse forms of knowledge to be valued, including the wisdom of elders, dreams and spiritual guides; relations that extend beyond human to include other animals, the land, water and all living things. Indigenous languages are embedded with concepts reflecting the interconnectedness of all things. Some of these concepts translated into English include ‘all my relations’, ‘weaving the strands’, and ‘a web of community relations’.38 37 Kimberlé Crenshaw (1989).

Wosk Centre for Dialogue, Coast Salish Territories. 324 “Are Two-Spirit[ed people] understood as only marginalized or are they also understood as leaders, role-models and gifted with Indigenous teachings?”39The 2S Sub-Working Group recognizes that the absence of an intersectional lens has excluded the  2SLGBTQQIA+ community members from national inquiries and commissions such as the NIMMIWG and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.40  Further, colonialism has entailed the imposition of Western gender norms through the Indian Act, residential schools and other colonial systems. The 2S Sub-Working Group identified a need to develop a Two-Spirit specific gender-based analysis tool to ensure that the realities of our Two-Spirit and Indiqueer relatives are reflected and fully incorporated into this action plan and to address the exclusion as a missed opportunity to describe the imposition of binary gender identities onto Indigenous people.39 Institute of Intersectionality Research and Policy (2012) Summary of Themes: Dialogue on Intersectionality and Indigeneity.

Using fire as a metaphor, the 2S Sub-Working group has designed41 a user friendly diagram to represent a 2SLGBTQQIA+ approach to GBA. Fire is a staple in every Indigenous culture and community. Centred in our homes, pit-houses, lodges, tipis and igloos, fire is a necessity for life. In the following diagram of a fire, the stones (GREY) represent cultural strengths that 2SLGBTQQIA+ relatives hold within communities. A wide variety of external factors ingrained in the design of systems and structures in the Canadian state, continue to impact the lives of 2SLGBTQQIA+ people; featured in the diagram as filling the white space around the fire. The logs (BROWN) depict the various mainstream-identified GBA intersectional factors, while the flames (RED) of the fire describe the specific intersectionalities of 2SLGBTQQIA+. 41 The framework of the fire was conceptualized by Percy Lezard (September 12, 2020) as a member of the Sn’penkton, as a Sqilx 2 Spirit person who holds the responsibilities of a firekeeper. 4A 2SLGBTQQIA+  approach to ‘Intersectionality’Status of Women Canada’s Gender-Based Analysis Intersectionality GraphicExternal FactorsHomophobiaHeteronormativityIndian ActTransphobiaAIDSPhobiaCissexismSixties ScoopHouselessnessCisnormativityInstitutional ReligionIncome SecurityAbleismSystemic InvisibilityFood SecurityCultural IdentityComing inSuicideSubstance useMental HealthAlienation of FCUnreported SXAHuman RightsIndigenous RightsColonizationIndian Residential SchoolsNation to Nation Relationships Cultural Strengths2SLGBTQQIA+ IntersectionalFactorsConnection to culture and Tradition Spirituality Gender Affirming Interventions and SupportLeadershipFuturismsResurgence ResiliencyDiversity of traditional values/beliefsCelebration of sacredness of 2SLGBTQQIA+Trauma InformedCulturally SafeGBA+ IntersectionalFactorsGeography SpiritualityEducationEmploymentAge and Life StageSocial OrientationDiverse AbilityEntrepreneurshipTeachingsTwo-Spirit Knowledge KeepersChildrenTraditionsTwo-Spirit EldersYouthLanguageAncestorsLandArtistsFood & MedicinesArtistsTwo-Spirit LeadershipInherent Indigenous RightsIntergenerational Relations (Chosen Family)Indispensable to the wellness of family & community27Research and  Data CollectionSummaries of Trans/Non-Binary and Inuit conversationsAs part of the process for gathering data for this report, the 2S Sub-Working Group reached out to our Trans and Inuit communities to provide us with their knowledge, life experiences and recommendations. The research and data collection used a mixed methods approach, including involving and honouring Traditional Knowledge and Teachings through the guidance of Two-Spirit Knowledge Keepers and Elders. Qualitatively, using a narrative analysis, there was attention paid to use culturally safe ways with a focus on honouring traditional oral histories and honouring the lived experiences of our 2SLGBTQQIA+ kin as field experts. Their input is crucial to the development of the Action Plan to address the Calls to Justice contained in the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ Final Report.We engaged the expertise of Two-Spirit Knowledge Keeper Charlotte Nolin to consult with Trans42 identified members of 2SLGBTQQIA+ communities. Key items identified as requiring immediate attention and action are:• The need to reform the justice system to address the systemic and historical relationship of Indigenous people must include Trans/2SLGBTQQIA and Indigenous governance and justice systems that centres around the restoration of the victims healing and safety needs.• Housing security was highlighted as a multi-generational issue for youth, adults and seniors, requiring a response from all levels of government.42 In this group defining trans would include: “trans male, trans female, trans masculine, trans feminine, non-binary, gender non-conforming and transexual, people who don’t/won’t use these descriptors.528• The importance of educating society as a whole about the acceptance of gender and sexual diversity would result in less violence directed towards 2SLGBTQQIA+ people.• Harm Reduction Models incorporated within the delivery of services, would save lives.• Treatment Centres which should work from a trauma-informed perspective, include programming designed outside of the binary gender system, ensure that elders and knowledge keepers work from a place of inclusivity and safety for 2SLGBTQQIA+ people. • Access to land to create centres specific to Culture, Ceremonies, Traditional Foods and Medicines would provide culturally safe programming and support. We engaged the expertise of Patricia Baxter to consult with our Inuit 2SLGBTQQIA+ kin and share the following as key areas of action:• Inuit specific programs, services and spaces for Inuk self-identifying within the 2SLGBTQQIA+  is a priority. In person, online and through social connections are the preferred way to make this available.•  Inuit specific history and cultural education is required especially how previously the Inuit held a strong acceptance of Inuk from the 2SLGBTQQIA+  community.•  Inuit-specific mental health and counselling services must be increased. •  Increased resources (funding and information)  for Inuit specific services within the mainstream 2SLGBTQQIA+ community, as Inuit continue to experience violence, discrimination and bullying. 29Engagement with 2SLGBTQQIA+ Participants: Sex Work / Sex TradeWe engaged the expertise of Charlotte Nolin to consult with Two-Spirit and/or Trans, Non-Binary 2SLGBTTQQIA+ kin and share the following as key areas of action:• Sex work or formerly-trafficked specific safety planning, that includes but is not limited to how to be safe, how to negotiate with Johns, how to not be exposed to Sexually Transmitted Infection & Blood-Borne Infection, minimize stigma from families and communities.• Sex work or formerly-trafficked specific services and support from medical care, social services and housing that need to be culturally safe and trauma-informed.•  Sex work or formerly-trafficked specific initiatives from a social determinants of health perspective to ensure that Two-Spirit and/or Gender diverse folks are not driven to sex work or trafficked. • Increased resources (funding and anti-violence education and advocacy) for sex work or formerly-trafficked Two-Spirit and gender diverse sex workers who have identified that they experience extremes of violence and fetishization in sex work due to their intersecting identities of Indigeneity and gender identity. • Increased anti-homophobia, anti-transphobia and gender/sexual diversity education to reduce stigma in communities of origin for our sex work or formerly trafficked relatives. Many are pushed out of their communities of origin not only because of their sexual orientation or gender diversity; but are further stigmatized for being in the sex work industry or trafficked; when all they want is to be accepted. SummaryThe writer would like to take this opportunity to enlighten the audience who will peruse this document and its contents. The topic of Sex Work/Sex Trade is one that most polite \"society\" would 30rather not talk about. Its dark and sinister concept isn't considered appropriate for the dinner table conversation. The writer attempts to amplify why some individuals from our community had for engaging in this field of work. First and foremost, let us take a closer look at the home situation for many interviewed individuals on this topic. For many, there was no home situation once they opened themselves to their family members. Physical violence may have been one of the reasons they left home, or addictions were within the family unit may have brought them to the attention of Child and Family Services, \"CFS\". Some others might have been introduced to the industry by friends who had been engaging in it for some time.Who is to blame? Why do they do it? A multitude of professional individuals has tried to understand this mystery for years. Whatever the reasons for ending up in the web of betrayal, the participants would like the readers to know that they have a story to share. The writer will attempt to capture the true essence of their words and compile their stories to be added to the Final Report. All of these stories contain similarities and yet stand out on their own in unique ways. The writer invites society to take the time to see through the participants' eyes the reasons for their involvement and the outcomes of their lives. The participants were interviewed, utilizing a series of questions to solicit the necessary information to bring the experiences of Indigenous Sex Work/Sex Trade workers into the light to being to address the real issues facing a marginalized segment of our community.  As this work is very sensitive, each of the participants was advised that if they required a counsellor or an Elder's services, that one would be provided. The writer is very familiar with the issues that can arise when discussing this topic and asks the readers to do so with an open mind. The writer also asks the readers of this document that they learn from the participants' experiences and reserve judgement for the perpetrators of this field of work.31Resiliency and Resurgence for Two-Spirit PeopleTwo-Spirit People prevail and are considered the epitome of resilience among Indigenous people. In the last three decades, Indigenous scholars who are Two-Spirit have led the campaign of retelling their stories in their languages, worldviews, and perspectives. The discourse surrounding Two-Spirit identity was historically in the hands of non-Indigenous writers, historians and anthropologists yet they were too far removed from Indigenous cultural perspectives and languages. Indigenous groups developed powerful voices to advocate for Two-Spirit People who were marginalized during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s, leading to the foundations of Two-Spirit organizations in various urban centres across Canada.The movement by Two-Spirit People to shift the power of balance back in the hands of Two-Spirit People began by continuously acknowledging their traditional knowledge and cultural teachings as part of the ceremonial circles. Since the early 1990s, Indigenous authors, scholars, and educators implemented the term Two-Spirit as a source of resurgence. Scholarship about Indigenous gender, sexuality and sex increased by implementing cultural knowledge and literary expressions in film, documentaries, books and research.The resurgence movement made strides in the mainstream 2SLGBTQQIA+ community where Two-Spirit People felt marginalized because of racism. There have been campaigns in the queer community to advance the rights of Two-Spirit People; it has been a continuous relationship-building process and advocacy by Two-Spirit People to make spaces in the queer community. Two-Spirits often remind queer organizations that Two-Spirit People were always there since the beginning of the first marches and rallies for 2SLGBTQQIA+ rights, leading to national pride movements. The simple fact is queer settlers did not regard Two-Spirit People as part of the community, or simply did not acknowledge them because of racism and their systemic settler-centrism. The development and establishment of a number of Two-Spirit / gender and sexually 632diverse community-based organizations such as:  the Greater Vancouver Native Cultural Centre43, 2 Spirited People of the 1st Nations44, Bay Area Two-Spirits Society45, Montana 2 Spirit Society46, Northeast Two-Spirit Society47, Northwest Two-Spirit Society48, Edmonton 2 Spirit Society49, 2 Spirited People of Manitoba Inc.50, 2 Spirits in Motion Society51 has been one response to this erasure within mainstream settler queerness. These agencies provide culturally safe models of service to our various 2SLGBTQQIA+ First Nations, Métis and Inuit kin and family.Two-Spirit People today are academics, researchers, leaders, policymakers; the list is endless. Ironically, the final frontier of resurgence and recentring of Two-Spirit cultural identity needs to take hold in the Indigenous community in every context of culture, governance, ceremony, health, education, and community development for cultural continuity. The resurgence process can only be successful if systemic shifts are made in those areas. These shifts must take place within all demographics of the Indigenous community, in all spaces, all the time. Any gestures of support to undo the devastation and harms done by colonization need to be done with the explicit guidance and direction of Two-Spirit, gender and sexually diverse Indigenous peoples, and with Indigenous peoples more broadly, so as to not risk repeating colonial and gendered violence histories.[I]ndigeneity were its own kind of death sentence. We know, however, that the state is the perpetrator, that colonialism is 43 Greater Vancouver Native Cultural Centre  https://www.facebook.com/gvncs78/ 44 2 Spirited People of the First Nations  http://www.2spirits.com 45 Bay Area Two Spirits Society https://www.baaits.org 46 Montana 2 Spirit Society  https://www.mttwospirit.org 47 Northeast Two Spirit Society https://ne2ss.typepad.com 48 Northwest Two Spirit Society https://www.facebook.com/groups/nw2spiritsociety/ 49 Edmonton 2 Spirit Society https://www.facebook.com/groups/nw2spiritsociety/ 50 2 Spirited People of Manitoba Inc. https://twospiritmanitoba.ca 51 2 Spirits in Motion Society  https://2spiritsinmotion.com 33the perpetrator, and that Indigenous peoples are resisting and world-building as we speak. In fact, some of us are already on our way to the future; we’re conjuring an ethic needed to create a space-time in which violence against Indigenous peoples isn’t a survival tactic.” (Belcourt, 2015).34Futurisms:  How to reimagine another future is possible, recommendations.2SLGBTQQIA+ Basket summaryTwo-Spirit Baskets Framework “Two-Spirit identity is about circling back to where we belong, reclaiming, reinventing, and redefining our beginnings, our roots, our communities, our support systems and our collective and individual selves.” (Alex Wilson, 2008)735While there is no contestation about the resilience of 2SLGBTTQIA+ people, the level of violence, exclusion and erasure that our community members continue to experience is in need of immediate attention at multiple levels. In early 2020, the national 2 Spirits in Motion Society (2SiMS) conducted a government funded, 2nd Look Engagement Project into national Two-Spirit First Nations, Métis and Inuit responses to the NIMMIWG2S Calls for Justice. This engagement process and the resulting report explored for the first time how these Two-Spirit specific Calls for Justice can be deepened, and also ways that 2SiMS and other national Indigenous organizations and leadership can continue to work towards eradicating violence against Two-Spirit and Indigequeer People both outside and within Indigenous communities across Canada.52The 2nd Look Engagement Project Report provided a framework for Two-Spirit strategic and community development, futurisms, and visionary work that addresses and eliminates the impacts of gender-based violence against Two-Spirit and Indigequeer community members. Stories shared during this historic engagement centres the reclamation of Two-Spirit ancestral responsibilities and places within a wide variety of Indigenous cultures, identities, experiences, and relationality within Indigenous ways of knowing and being.Using the baskets as a metaphor; for their strength of weaving in community connections and the conservation of tradition; the 2S Sub-Working group proposes the following Calls to Action, to hold the recommendations which will bring change to the lives of our 2SLGBTQQIA+ people. 52 2SiMS, (Aug,2020). 2nd Look Engagement Project Report.

Regular funding  will be  the wise practiceNational72ConclusionThe NIMMIWG Final Report reveals that persistent and deliberate human and Indigenous rights violations and abuses are the root cause of Canada’s staggering rates of violence against MMIWG2S. The Report issues 231 Calls for Justice,  31 Calls for Justice which are Two-Spirit specific. Colonial systems and violence have eroded traditional roles, and traditional authority of Indigenous women and Two-Spirit People in our communities and families. The lack of protections in Canadian social, political, economic, and justice institutions, coupled with ongoing and consistent homo/transphobia, hetero/homonormativity, and heteropatriarchy have infiltrated most Indigenous cultures and communities, and have left Two-Spirit and Indigequeer identified People increasingly vulnerable to multiple forms of violence.The construction of gender itself in western conceptualizations, and within English language and interpretation does not allow for the full expression and realization of the rainbow of Indigenous gender and sexuality. National program and community development strategies, intergenerational intervention, action planning, and knowledge gathering related to the eradication of violence against Two-Spirit community members must first root in the recovery and reclamation of Two-Spirit traditions and practices within Indigenous land-based, ancestral knowledge systems and protocols.Futurities The concept of futurity and futurism; specifically Afro-futurism; has been generously shared with the world by Black scholar Dr. Grace Dillon. Afro and Indigenous-futurism encapsulates multiple types of art-making including literature, visual art and music. It is a process of decolonization to reimagine a future that constructs self-determination and self-determined representations and alternative narratives about their identities and futures. For 2SLGBTTQIA+ people, this imagining of a future is an act of 873resistance, specifically when we are purposefully erased from past existence, not just in Indigenous communities, but also in mainstream queer communities. Two-Spirit, gender and sexually diverse Indigenous people have persisted through over 400 years of ongoing colonization. Hundreds of years of forced assimilation, as well as colonial and state mechanisms of genocide have kept Two-Spirit, and gender and sexually diverse Indigenous peoples on the periphery of traditional and western societies - or else they have removed them entirely. For Indigenous people and communities, acceptance and the act of welcoming Two-Spirit, gender and sexually diverse Indigenous people back into communities, and back into the sacred circle of our cultures will help to close the sacred hoop that was torn open by colonization. The resurgence of traditional roles and responsibilities, gender, sexuality, and teachings, provides for the potential reduction of community conflict, lateral and domestic violence, incarceration, homelessness and misogyny. It requires bringing the past into the present, and forging a new history for future generations. Our current living is not an imagined future dystopia, it is a current reality. As we live through a time when Black and Afro-Indigenous thinkers, activists and artists are actively invoking a global movement for the validity of Black life, we must ask ourselves, what is the context for Two-Spirit and Indigequeer people in this future when we consistently find ourselves being erased from national discourses; considered only as after thoughts or merely addendumized at the end of queer acronyms and national inquiries? Why are we always an after-thought and not the centrality of the strengths of our nations? How can we honour our land-based teachings and prophecies when we are not welcomed back to our homelands? This is no longer acceptable, and is not aligned with Indigenous concepts of relationally, gender, sexuality, or ancestral knowledges. Support mechanisms for 2SLGBTQQIA+ people must be two-fold, in that consideration must be made to expand and support both rural/on-reserve contexts, and urban 2SLGBTQQIA+ development, as well as healing and cultural reclamation strategies for First Nations, Métis 74and Inuit Two-Spirit, Indigequeer identified People and their family members.53We call for a movement for our Two-Spirit and Indigequeer kin to return to our family/community/ceremonial circles, to be embraced for the sacredness we carry in our spirits and to take our rightful place in our respective Nations. As 2SLGBTQQIA+, we have always been here, and we will continue to exist and share responsibilities in our families and communities. Richard Jenkins, former Director General of the 2 Spirits in Motion Society (2SiMS), shares the significance of the relationship of 2SLGBTQQIA+ people to being ‘medicine bundles’54 as he worked and developed the 2SiMS from his home in Treaty 6 territory of Alberta. Treaty 6 is the only treaty in the country that specifically references a ‘medicine chest clause’.55We are the medicine bundles, which are to be applied to make the Indigenous family, community, and ceremonial circles whole again.53 Corrina Sparrow, Personal communication, October 8, 2020.54 Richard Jenkins, Personal Communication, November 13, 2020. 55 This concept lays the treaty-based foundation for seeing 2SLGBTQQIA+ people as distinct parts, expressions and extensions of the concept of a ‘medicine chest’ given the shared perspective that we are the medicine bundles.75APPENDICESTerms of ReferenceMandate:The 2SLGBTQQIA+ Sub-Working Group will contribute to and support the work of the Core Working Group and other sub-working groups towards the development of a National Action Plan.

Conflict of Interest:2SLGBTQQIA+ sub-working group members are required to divulge, in writing to Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, any situation of potential or real conflict of interest. In this context, a conflict of interest is defined as a situation in which a person is in a position to derive personal benefit from actions or decisions made in their capacity as a member of the 2SLGBTQQIA+ Sub-Working Group. Simply being a member of a group or organization that may benefit from implementation funding is not considered a conflict of interest.Changes to the Terms of Reference:The Chair(s) of the sub-working group may seek to amend these Terms of Reference at any time in consultation with members.57 Members are permitted to share meeting reports with their organizations.792SLGTBQQIA+  Sub Working Group  Members - BiographiesSylvia Maracle, Chair 2SLGBTQQIA+ Sub-Working GroupSylvia Maracle (Skonaganleh:ra) is a Two-Spirit Mohawk, Wolf Clan member from Tyendinaga Mohawk Territories.

It allows me to be who I am, personally, professionally, as a traditional person and as an advocate.  So many members of the 2SLGBTQQIA+ community have suffered significant physical, mental, emotional and spiritual violence.  When the National Inquiry opened the discussion, it was important to carry forward.  Working with other 2SLGBTQQIA+ people who have been carrying the fire publicly to reclaim our space and place has been exhilarating and heartwarming.  It will take more than flag raising and added us to the group as a list.  It will mean governance changes, resource BSylvia Maracle80allocations, supportive policy and leadership.

The opportunity to create a 2SLGBTQQIA+ National Action Plan allows us to set a course of action to begin significantly interrupting the systems and policies that have harmed our nations for many generations. Reducing violence experienced by the 2SLGBTQQIA+ community carries a sacred obligation.The 2SLGBTQQIA+ must reclaim their sacred duties in our nations that our ancestors have so instructed. Those duties must-see 2SLGBTQQIA+ take the lead in our ceremonies, in the decision-making process and the preservation of our culture and language. If we make lasting changes now, our actions will positively affect the lives of current and future 2SLGBTQQIA+ people. The slaughter and destruction of 2SLGBTQQIA+ lives, the lives of their families and their communities must end. The government and church must never again silence the voices of 2SLGBTQQIA+.”Ma-Nee Chacaby, ElderMa-Nee Chacaby is a two-spirit, Ojibway/Cree Elder.

My grandmother started to take care of me when I was two years old.  She was 88 years old then.  My grandmother said that I special and when I was 4 began ceremonies and teachings where I was told I was “nizho ojhijack” 2Spirit.  My grandmother continued the ceremonies with me until I was 15.  She journeyed to the spirit world at 108.I was taught lots of ceremonies, traditions and healing work was in my future.  Grandmother said the teachings were from her own grandmother who had gathered them in the 1850’s.  She did not just teach one or a few ceremonies there were lots of things I had to learn and know.  It was emphasized that lots of ceremonial, traditional and healing work was in my future.  I was also taught by other 2Spirit people in the community and in on the land and the bush who shared their stories and teachings. I remembered meeting two women “nizho Ojhijack” who were raising five children together than they were asked to raise.What I came to understand that 2Spirit people have to understand both binary roles-male and female that were brought over here to Canada.  We have to understand the 2Sprit so we can internally and externally help both groups to look after Canada- the land, 82water, plants and animals.  We are supposed to be the Great Spirits helpers here on our Mother Earth.When I went to residential school they tried to take all this away from me.  When I went through the Indian Residential School Survivors process they did not recognize me as 2Spirit even though we existed before they did.  I tried to identify myself as 2Spirit and they would not recognize me, only as binary.As we recover so many people around me, especially young people come out.  I do not know one single person who went back in.  People want teachings, ceremonies and it is time for those of us with the knowledge to share our history about who 2Spirit are.”Raven DavisRaven Davis is an Anishinaabe, 2-Spirit, transgender, disabled identified, multidisciplinary artist, and educator whose maternal lineage is from Treaty Four in Manitoba, Canada.

I’ve stayed in the 2 Spirit circle since then to continue expressing my commitment to helping improve the quality of life of 2 Spirit and gender and sexually diverse people and create safe and supportive social environments for our part of the Indigenous gender diverse community.Richard Jenkins85Percy LezardThey/Them/Theirs Critical Sqilxw Clinician / Researcher / ScholarPercy is a registered member of the Penticton Indian Band and their people, the Sqilx, have lived on the territory known as the Okanagan Valley since the beginning of people on our land. Percy`s background includes over thirty+ years of field experience as a social worker, activist, researcher and scholar and with strong relations with many Indigenous communities, both urban and on reserve; as well as solidarity work with Black & Racialized communities and across multiple marginalities. Wherever they go, they bring a specialization in Indigenous social work, 2Spirit pedagogies, Indigenous research methodologies, substance use/misuse, harm reduction, anti-racist/anti-colonial praxis and trauma-informed practices. Percy combines these theories, research approaches and frameworks of understanding to create a culture of healing wherever they go. Their current focus is on ensuring this culture of healing is fostered and supported within systems and structures.“I do this work because it needs to get done. Until society stops seeing Indigenous women, girls & 2SLGBTTQIA+ as disposable and without humanity I will continue to advocate and hold systems and structures accountable for the daily violence’s against our families, communities and nations.

Even though I came out my personal journey has not been easy. Direct participation will mean that it may be easier for someone else in the future to come out. Alexa KeleutakPercy Lezard86For others, this work I am helping with will be a steppingstone for them to start their journey.  It will give them a path, one that will have programs and services to support them.  That will change the world for LGBTQQIA Inuit.We do exist and need to support other young Inuit and older Inuit on their journey.  I hope this change happens in my generation.  It will be hard to convince the conservative Inuit population that there are more than two genders.

His family’s involvement in the Hudson’s Bay Company fur trade began in the early days of European contact and has spanned many generations. Born and raised in the small village of Cormorant, Albert’s family moved to the town of The Pas in 1963 where he lived until he was nineteen. In 1979, Albert moved to Vancouver and joined the Greater Vancouver Native Cultural Society (Canada’s first Two-Spirit community organization). Later, in Winnipeg, he was one of the organizers of the Nichiwakan Native Gay Society, (Winnipeg first Two-Spirit community organization) and participated in the first annual international Two-Spirit gathering in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1988. Albert has attended nineteen of the 32 international Two-Spirit gatherings.He has over thirty years of experience as a human rights activist and is one of the directors of the Two-Spirited People of Manitoba ( www.twospiritmanitoba.ca ). Albert began his Two-Spirit advocacy in Winnipeg in 1986 and became an HIV/AIDS activist in 1987. He was the director of the Manitoba Aboriginal AIDS Task Force from 1991 to 2001. In 2018, Albert received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Winnipeg. Albert lives in Winnipeg, where he works as a consultant specializing in Indigenous knowledge, cultural reclamation, and cross-cultural training. “I grew up in the 1960s when there was a tremendous push to assimilate Indigenous people into Canadian society. In this era many of our beliefs and practices were discarded including our land-based Albert McLeod87experiences and respect for the knowledge of our elders. In those days many 2Spirit people didn't plan things beyond a couple months or a year or two. We saw no future for ourselves due to the amount of lateral and physical violence we faced. Today, I am glad to participate in the development of the National Action Plan because I not only survived a year or two, I have survived an additional fifty-years to be here to provide my perspectives and insight into the process.”Corrina SparrowCorrina Sparrow comes from the Musqueam Nation, and the Qualicum Nation of the Pentlatch People on the west coast of what is now known as British Columbia; they also have Dutch ancestry on their paternal side. Corrina is a current PhD candidate with the Institute of Gender, Race, Sexuality & Social Justice at the University of British Columbia, whose research explores contemporary Coast Salish Two Spirit identity, resurgence, and the use of traditional nation-specific, land-based values and knowledge in strengthening Two Spirit/Indigenous queer wellness, and community. A recent MSW Indigenous Social Work graduate (University of Victoria 2018), Corrina also brings extensive community-based experience - from their current role as Social Development Manager and Social Worker at Musqueam Nation, to over twenty years of strong advocacy and helping work with Indigenous children and families, in the areas of child and family safety, cultural programming, community development, and social planning for both rural and urban communities. They sit on multiple local Indigenous working groups for Two Spirit advocacy, and is the elected BC representative, and an Executive Board member for the national 2 Spirits in Motion Society. Corrina is committed to helping Indigenous communities reclaim ancestral knowledges around inclusiveness and honouring of Two Spirit/Indigenous queer relatives, and in revitalization of healthy, decolonial conceptions of Indigenous genders and sexualities.“They approach this national and international Two Spirit research, leadership, and development work with humility, and the utmost respect for Indigenous land-based ways of knowing and being. They understand their own experience as a Two Spirit person, and their twenty-year span of working with Indigenous families and Corrina Sparrow88communities on local and national levels as training for the work that must be prioritized to support some of our most vulnerable Indigenous relations - our Two Spirit and Indigequeer identified community members.

As a Coast Salish Two Spirit researcher, I noticed there is a striking absence of west coast Indigenous and Coast Salish specific knowledge about Two Spirit identities, experiences and vision work in academic and community circles. Therefore, this research was conducted exclusively on Coast Salish territories, with Coast Salish-identified Two Spirit participants and allies. I apply my Four House Posts Coast Salish methodology in an Indigenous research framework, and through storytelling and art-based methods, this study asks - How does recognition of Coast Salish Two Spirit identity and experience contribute to community wellness and cultural resurgence? The intention of this study is to offer pathways for intergenerational healing and reconnections, cultural revitalization and transformation by weaving traditional Indigenous knowledges with contemporary narratives, in order to increase the voice and visibility of Coast Salish Two Spirit People.Wesley, S.

Unfortunately, Saylesh loses touch with her grandmother over the years but the pair  reconnect when her grandmother is in need.

Cambridge University Press.The companion to queer studies dedicates an entire chapter to Cree filmmaker Thirza Cuthand (she/her). Thirza’s films delve into her experiences of gender, exploration, life as a butch lesbian, and offers a first-person counter narrative from anthropological interpretations of Indigineity and queerness. In her work, humour has also allowed Thirza to takeup and express the difficult parts of being queer and Indigenous. Isolation, unsupportive communities and elders, relationships, and everything in between are  topics that she puts a personal spin on in her films. Coming out as TwoSpirit was a natural progression after trying to unsuccessfully find place of belonging in non-Indigenous queer community and realizing that she did not belong. The chapter also credits Thirza with coining the contemporary term, “indigequeer” in 2004 that is now being widely used by Indigenous 2SLGBTQQIA+ people.Wilson, A. (n.d.). N’tacimowin inna nah’: Our Coming In Stories. Canadian Women Studies, 26(3), 4.In this work Alex Wilson (she/her), Neyonawak Inniniwak from Opaskwayak Cree Nation, explores the process of ‘Coming-In’ to TwoSpirit identity. She describes how the Swampy Cree dialect has no word for homosexual nor any gender specific pronouns. Instead, the dialect distinguishes between what is animate and what Coast Salish image. Photo credit: Corrina Sparrow, Musqueam.92is inanimate — living, animate creatures and actions have a spiritual purpose (Ahenakew). Wilson further explores this understanding, extending it to ‘TwoSpirit’ which she describes as a process of, “…acknowledging that we are spiritually meaningful people. TwoSpirit identity may encompass all aspects of who we are, including our culture, sexuality, gender, spirituality, community, and relationship to the land.” (p. 193)Xtra Magazine.

In this interview, he describes his unique experiences as a child and student at Ermineskin residential school, where he attended for 6 years. Laurie recalls his time in residential school as different than that of the other children because he is TwoSpirit, stating that the intense and profound targeting due to being TwoSpirit in a homophobic Catholic institution was often overlooked as being distinctly different from other Indigenous children that attended residential schools.Kwakwaka’wakwHunt, S.

Prince George, BC: National Collaborating Centre for Aboriginal Health.Sarah Hunt (she/her) is a Kwagu’ł researcher and educator of the Kwakwaka’wakw Nation. This introductory material intended for medical professionals, Indigenous community, and researchers covers TwoSpirit topics from historical beginnings, present-day issues, as well as issues that are still emerging. The effects of colonization on Indigenous gender and sexuality are at the forefront along with the social determinants of health, TwoSpirit youth, and HIV/AIDS. For this report, Hunt used a mix of peer and non-peer reviewed sources, as well as analyzed TwoSpirit activism to better understand emerging sociopolitical issues and how TwoSpirit health is impacted by colonization. Hunt emphasizes that TwoSpirit 93health must be understood from within a dual context of colonial oppression and heteropatriarchy, and in relation to TwoSpirit resurgence of traditional identities and gender roles.TwoSpirit resiliency and resurgence conclude the report, in addition to a call for Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples to educate themselves on cultural gender and sexual identities of TwoSpirit people so that TwoSpirit people can begin to have equitable, non judgemental and access to safer health services.Mi’kmawRobinson, M.

Robinson’s most recent work speaks to TwoSpirit history and  settler-colonial governments who have sought to erase and exclude TwoSpirit and gender  and sexually diverse Indigenous peoples. Settler society has begun to shift toward inclusivity regarding gender and sexuality, in turn causing some governments to adopt a progressive approach to gender. Robinson discusses that this progress has begun to resemble the Indigenous ways of being and acceptance of TwoSpirit and gender and sexually diverse people that were and still continue to be  targets of erasure through colonial systems. She goes on to identify the means of colonization that served to erase TwoSpirit people, the history of berdache and TwoSpirit terms, and finishes by urging a change among Indigenous peoples in how gender is practiced, and to move towards traditional gender expression rooted in Indigenous values, ways of being, language and relationship with the land.Michi Saagiig NishnaabegSimpson, L.

Participants emphasized that TwoSpirit is a complex term with multiple meanings. Laing shares how, for some, “…the word is connected to distinct teachings they hold, while for others it’s a placeholder term until they can find words in their Indigenous languages to describe who they are.” (p. 4) This zine is clear in stating that any way that trans, queer and TwoSpirit Indigenous peoples creates meaning out of the ‘TwoSpirit’ term is entirely valid.

Analyzing what happened to the joyas, Deborah Miranda applies the concept of gendercide to joyas people. The systematic punishing, targeting and elimination of Indigenous people perceived to be outside of male and female genders  by Spanish colonizers was meant to enforce colonial Christian gender and sex ideals on the joyas, or eradicate them altogether. History, reemergence of the joyas and TwoSpirited people, and the complicated and often dark history of the joyas and Spaniards spans the rest of the paper. Miranda ends with identifying six key areas that will support the TwoSpirit community in reentering and revitalizing traditional roles within the Indigenous community.Oji-CreeDeerchild, R.

York University: Ontario Canada.Martin Cannon (he/him) is an author, researcher, and associate professor of social justice education at the University of Toronto, and member of the Onyota’a:ka (Oneida) Nation of Six Nations at Grandriver Territory. In “The Regulation of First Nations Sexuality” Cannon critically explores the Indian Act and how it enacts heterosexuality, racism, and colonial gender norms upon First Nations peoples who traditionally accepted and revered what we now understand to be TwoSpirit gender and sexually diverse people. Cannon proceeds to posit that racism, patriarchy, and heterosexism developed in relation to colonizers and missionaries viewing First Nations peoples as nefarious, subordinate, underdeveloped, and against God.  These observations through a Christian Eurocentric  lens and lack of understanding of First Nations culture lead to these  views being reflected in the Indian Act.MétisMonkman, L. (2019 August 13).

Red River Métis TwoSpirit chairperson Nicki Ferland (she/her) says he new  local will mean that Métis TwoSpirit people  and the Métis 2SLGBTQQIA+ community will have a voice in decision making, economics, and all things related to Métis governance and Métis citizens. The creation of the local will also mean access to 2SLGBTQQIA+-Métis-specific resources for the Métis queer community. Despite having active TwoSpirit elders and citizens,  there has been no 2SLGBTQQIA+ representation or voice so the newly created local will fill this need. In addition to giving voice and political capabilities to its members, the TwoSpirit local hopes to support 2SLGBTQQIA+ Métis in accessing spiritual and ceremonial 97opportunities, as well as engage in community building and language initiatives.Pyle, K.

Pyle also introduces a new term: trans*temporal kinship, defined as the, “…ability of TwoSpirit people to establish kin relations across time, with both ancestors and descendants.” (p. 574) The term ‘berdache’ is discussed, specifically its derogatory nature and the work of ‘discovering historical berdaches’ being done by white anthropologists. Pyle notes that these anthropological works do not consider or involve modern TwoSpirit people, pointing to a broader theme of settler/colonial appropriation.InuitWalley, M. (2018).

From the 1980’s and onward, more nuanced gender interpretations of Inuit culture, archeological record and more progressive values in society have meant that archeologists and researchers are paying more attention to what was first overlooked or misinterpreted. By recognizing nonbinarism and gender diversity as integral to Inuit culture as well as rooted in history, Walley hopes to affirm Inuit identities and improve the circumstances of Inuit nonbinary, genderfluid, and gender-nonconforming  peoples in today’s world in addition to reflecting historical accuracy.98SettlerFeinberg, L.

    "abstract": "Categories of gender, sex and sexuality have been introduced through colonial processes and institutions. The term Two-Spirit encompasses a broad range of sexual and gender identities of Indigenous peoples across North America and complicates distinctions between gender, sex and sexualities7 . While the term is used by some people to refer to the cultural roles of individuals embodying both female and male spirits, the term has also been used as an umbrella term to describe Indigenous people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, queer, intersex and part of the continuum of non-heterosexual identities. It is important to distinguish between gender, sex and sexuality because of the way lesbian, gay and bisexual people are linked with transgender, transsexual people in the 2SLGBTQQIA+ acronym, and in broader queer and Indigenous communities",
