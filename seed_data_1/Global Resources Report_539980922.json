We released the last edition of this report in May 2020, sharing it into an emerging pandemic that we knew would hit worldwide LGBTI communities hard. The two years since then have been a process of developing analysis, clarity, and action about the scope of those impacts and the scale of response that is demanded. We've also witnessed a series of humanitarian crises causing forced migration with specific impacts and vulnerabilities for LGBTI communities. And if that wasn't enough, those who oppose LGBTI human rights have leveraged the crises we all face to escalate their attacks.LGBTI communities face urgent conditions, and grantmakers must mobilize together to financially resource the movements that can meet those needs.But it is important to recognize that the attacks and the crises are not the only story that is told in this report. Over 6,000 grantees around the world received funding for their efforts to support LGBTI communities in 2019 and 2020, an increase of 38 percent.The movement is strong, it is growing. LGBTI communities are meeting their own needs and their neighbors' needs when state structures and humanitarian systems fail to value LGBTI lives.This report does not include grant descriptions, but I can tell you that these descriptions overflow with creativity, visionary strategy, and ceaseless commitment to build a better world. Against all odds, LGBTI people exist everywhere and they are organizing for survival and for the right to access joy, pleasure, and embodiment. Our work is simply to put resources in their hands. Yours in solidarity, Matthew Hart Director, Global Philanthropy Project4 52019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesLetter from GPP DirectorIntroductionWe are pleased to present the 2019–2020 Global Resources Report: Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities, a comprehensive report on the state of foundation and government funding for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) issues. This report documents over 15,000 grants awarded by 499 foundations, intermediary NGOs, and corporations and by 17 donor government and multilateral agencies. The report provides details on the distribution of LGBTI funding by geography, issue, strategy, population focus, and donor type. It is a tool for identifying trends, gaps, and opportunities in the rapidly changing philanthropic and development landscapes.The 2019–2020 Global Resources Report builds on three previous editions, now documenting comprehensive data across eight calendar years and enabling deeper analysis of LGBTI funding trends.The Global Resources Report is the most comprehensive resource available on worldwide LGBTI funding, and it provides powerful data to advocates ranging from grassroots local LGBTI movement leaders to global development actors. Advocates for funding equity regularly use the report to make the case for closing funding gaps. Grantmakers use the data to develop strategic funding plans and increase their impacts. Donor governments use the report to inform their foreign affairs funding and policies. The previous three editions of the report have catalyzed new funds for LGBTI communities and have been regularly used to better attune LGBTI funding to address unmet needs. Given the Global Philanthropy Project’s mission to expand global philanthropic support to advance the human rights of LGBTI people in the Global South and East, we are pleased to report that in 2019–2020 over $184 million, or 32 percent, of all funding for LGBTI issues was focused on the Global South and East. Compared to the previous report, this total increased by over $10 million.We are especially pleased that over 70 foundations based outside of the United States and three donor governments were included for the first time in this edition. We aim to continue expansion of the dataset in future years.The process of developing this report during an ongoing pandemic required a powerful level of care, commitment, and determination including the efforts of each Global Philanthropy Project staff member and the report’s 16-member advisory committee; each grantmaker who shared their data; all of our partner networks who shared the call for data with their members; our partners at Funders for LGBTQ Issues who compiled and shared the data from U.S.-based foundations and who have supported this project arm-in-arm with GPP across all eight years; and finally, each of the GPP members and partners who supported the costs of the report. The philanthropic ecosystem will use the gifts of this collective effort to inform, leverage, and catalyze money to LGBTI communities. With gratitude to all of these efforts and to the movements for LGBTI human rights whose work is represented in these pages, may it be a tool to deliver the resources that LGBTI communities need to build safety, community, and power in the years ahead.

For example, a human rights organization receiving a grant to provide asylum services to marginalized refugees, open and welcoming of all refugees, including LGBTI people, would not be included in the report. It would be included if that same human rights organization received a grant to provide asylum services specifically supporting LGBTI refugees. In some cases, donors who track funding to multiple impacted populations have been able to identify a prorated percentage of a larger grant with demonstrated LGBTI focus.A longer section on this report’s methodology is included on pages 138-145; and here we share some key points for an accurate reading of the reported data.Throughout the report, charts include a key to indicate whether funds awarded for the purpose of regranting are included. Funds awarded for regranting are removed from most calculations to avoid double-counting. Lists of top donors and charts showing funding by the type of donor do include funds awarded for regranting to document the full amount of LGBTI funding flowing from (or through) each donor or donor type.This report documents full grant amounts to the year the grant was awarded, not the year(s) of grant disbursement. This means that for multiyear commitments, the full sum of the grant is counted in the year in which it was awarded. For example, a three-year grant for $30,000 awarded in 2019 and disbursed in three annual payments of $10,000 would be documented in this report as a $30,000 grant in 2019.Throughout this report, charts include a key to indicate whether funds focused on the United States of America (the U.S.) are included. This report contains two primary data streams. Grant data from foundations based in the United States is collected by Funders for LGBTQ Issues and shared with Global Philanthropy Project for the development of this global report. Grant data from foundations based outside of the United States and from government and multilateral agencies is collected directly by Global Philanthropy Project. Funders for LGBTQ Issues produces a detailed U.S. domestic LGBTI funding tracking report. In this report, funding focused on the United States is often excluded from otherwise global calculations.Domestic government funding is not included in this report. The report consists of funding by donor governments focused on international development efforts to advance LGBTI rights.INCLUDEDNOT INCLUDEDThroughout the report, all monetary figures are provided in United States dollars (USD). While submissions were received in multiple currencies, they were calculated in USD based on mid-year exchange8 92019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesMethodology Key PointsThe Big PictureOverview of Global LGBTI Funding, 2019–2020Total Funds49915,837$576 million6,03617Number of Foundations, NGO Intermediaries, and CorporationsNumber of GrantsNumber of Donor Governments and Multilateral AgenciesNumber of Grantees2019-20202017-2018$576 M$560 M+3%SCOPE AND CONTEXT OF REPORTThis fourth edition of the Global Resources Report draws from a combined eight years of data to provide an overview of philanthropic funding for LGBTI issues worldwide. It documents data on funding from private and public foundations, intermediary NGOs, corporations, donor government agencies, and multilateral agencies. This edition of the report features funding awarded in calendar years 2019 and 2020 for LGBTI-focused organizations and for projects that specifically focus on LGBTI communities. Between the 2017–2018 reporting period and the 2019–2020 reporting period, global LGBTI funding grew by nearly $16 million, or 3 percent. In comparing the same period, there was a 4 percent increase in the number of reported grants.112019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureCHART 1.1: GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  YEARS (2013–2020)Including funding focused on the United States2-YEAR TOTALSFLUCTUATIONS BY REPORTING PERIODCOVID ImpactsYear-to-year fluctuations in funding are largely due to changes in the reported data available. While this has been true throughout the four editions of this report, the challenge is significantly exacerbated during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While the Global Resources Report develops increasingly comprehensive and accurate documentation of global LGBTI funding data over time, and many new donors are making LGBTI-focused grants, this iteration of the report includes over 200 fewer grantmakers than the previous edition. Some donors may have deprioritized LGBTI funding, but this decrease in reporting is not an indicator of a trend away from LGBTI funding. Rather, delayed reporting largely due to the impacts of COVID-19 is the primary reason for the decreased number of grantmakers in this report. This issue showed up in several different ways. 1  The primary reason for this number’s sharp decline is that there was less publicly available information than usual on foundation spending in the United States during the collection period. Some institutions delayed or did not release annual reports and the release of the tax forms that U.S. foundations are required to file declaring their funding was delayed from past years. This shift also relates to a change in collection methodology by Funders for LGBTQ Issues, which did not prioritize the same levels of manual review of online financials/annual reports as in previous years.2  The decreased reporting from Candid is in large part due to the same delayed U.S. tax form release schedule that is identified in the previous footnote.$420,075,004$239,277,592$243,326,943$297,473,055$312,492,214$180,797,412$259,188,718 $262,818,613 $263,764,049$502,515,661 $560,404,061 $576,256,26320142013201620152018201720202019This issue especially impacted the number of U.S.-based donors included in the Funders for LGBTQ Issues domestic U.S. report, which decreased by nearly 250.1Another data source for this report, the Candid Foundation Maps database, did not yet include about 30 grantmakers whose LGBTI-focused grants had been counted in the previous Global Resources Report. Of those donors who could again be included from the Candid database, many had not yet been updated for their 2020 grants at the time of this report’s data collection close in early 2022.2 A smaller number of grantmakers based outside of the United States who had previously reported their data directly to Global Philanthropy Project could not renew reporting. For some, this was a change in their grantmaking, but many were explicit about lacking the capacity to report for this edition given both COVID-19 impacts and emergency humanitarian response to other crises.• • •-250U.S.-based donors12 132019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureThe Big PictureAt the same time, over 70 donors based outside of the United States were included for the first time in this edition. These newly reporting funds indicate that there are some new LGBTI funders and some funders newly inclusive of LGBTI issues. This also shows the impacts of increased outreach efforts to different stakeholders by Global Philanthropy Project. The issues causing delayed reporting for 2019 and 2020 impact the entire philanthropic ecosystem, from hyper-locally focused grantees and funders to those with a global reach. The authors of this report have done our best to document the trend lines, gaps, and opportunities of global LGBTI funding, given the impacts of these variables. For more information about fluctuations over time, see “Which Funders Are Missing from This Report” on page 134.• •Increasing Accuracy Over TimeThis report provides the data used by philanthropic, civil society, and government actors to map resources moving to global and regional LGBTI human rights and to advocate and make a case for new or improved funding. The report is produced over a full year—from data collection to publication—through the efforts of a multi-stakeholder ecosystem, and responsibility for its accuracy is shared and valued among its reporting donors.Some variation among the reported numbers is due to improvements over time in the Global Resources Report data collection, verification, and analysis processes. In developing this edition of the report, Global Philanthropy Project was able to work more closely with many reporting donors—offering guidance, adding elements to the reporting template, and following up with questions—resulting in more accurate coding. One key impact of this evolving process is an increased ability to exclude grants that are inclusive but not focused on LGBTI communities. As the dataset evolves with consecutive years of information about both donors and grantees, the analysts can also recode previous grants with more specificity. These improvements result in part from a more detailed analysis conducted in developing Global Philanthropy Project’s “Diving Deeper” brief series.3 Through this ongoing learning, the dataset becomes more accurate over time. These changes result in some shifts in the historic numbers presented in this report. Some previously-reported numbers have been revised due to corrections and clarifications, allowing us to more properly represent the data in alignment with our methodology. Despite the challenges in this reporting cycle, the report authors are encouraged by a growing community of practice around the ongoing improvement and refinement of data development to document global LGBTI funding. The increasing scope, accuracy, and transparency of this report are key to ongoing efforts within philanthropy, civil society, and government and multilateral agencies to increase and improve global and regional LGBTI funding toward a more equitable and effective distribution of funds, toward resources more aligned with the needs of LGBTI communities, and toward protecting and improving the human rights of all LGBTI people.3  Diving Deeper Series: Under the Surface of LGBTI Funding Data.

This significant difference was due to U.S. tax reporting delays. Despite the decreased number of donors included in the report, the total global LGBTI funding amount continued to increase, as did the number of grantees and the number of grants. These increases indicate the growth and evolution of global movements for LGBTI human rights.4NOTE: As a reminder, fluctuations in grant amounts over time are often due to the impact of large multiyear grants that are counted in the year awarded. This can impact any funding focus area, including geographies, populations, issues, and strategies.CHART 1.2: GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  NUMBER OF GRANTMAKERS5 (2013–2020)CHART 1.3: GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  NUMBER OF GRANTS (2013–2020)CHART 1.4: GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  NUMBER OF GRANTEES6 (2013–2020)4  Despite the decreased number of funders, the majority of foundations which were included in the previous report but not this one were those with low levels of LGBTI funding (in total amount and in number of grants). This helps to explain why the grant amounts and number of grants have increased over time despite the decreased number of grantmakers.  5  The total number of grants for 2017–2018 has decreased from the previously reported amount due to a clarification of the methodology, resulting in this updated number.6  The number of grants awarded to anonymous grantees has increased with each edition of the Global Resources Report and has grown by over 600 percent when comparing the current report to the 2013–2014 edition. These grantees are anonymized either by the grantees themselves or by the reporting donors, out of concern for safety and security due to operating within hostile environments. As a result, this report cannot distinguish the number of grantees receiving these grants. For this reason, the number of grantees is surely greater for each year than the numbers documented in this chart and in numbers identified throughout the report.-30%+4%+38%51615,8376,03616 172019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureThe Big PictureGLOBAL FUNDING COMPARISON7  The phrase \"less than 35 cents\" should be understood as indicating that the percentage would be significantly lower if overall foundation funding focused outside of the United States was possible to document and include in the comparison. The Global Resources Report used two sources for comparative funding data in 2013–2014 and 2015–2016: the Giving USA Annual Report on Philanthropy (focused on United States funding) and the European Foundation Sector report produced by Donors and Foundations Networks in Europe (DAFNE). In 2017–2018, the European sector report was no longer produced and the 2017–2018 Global Resources Report shifted to use comparative funding data from Candid Foundation Maps, which documented at least $165.3 billion in global foundation funding. While the Foundation Maps data for 2017 and 2018 was still in development at the time of the 2017–2018 Global Resources Report publication, it was then the most cohesive source available for comparative global foundation funding. At the time of the 2019–2020 Global Resources Report edition, the Foundation Maps data is less developed due to COVID-related delays. Returning to the previous model, this 2019–2020 report uses the Giving USA report as its comparative data source and now standardizes this comparison for all years. This edition's comparison number for all foundation funding in the United States is $164.24 billion. Unfortunately, similar overall comparisons are not available for other countries and/or regions.8  Official development assistance (ODA) is defined by the Organisation for Economic and Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) as government aid that promotes and specifically targets the economic development and welfare of developing countries. The OECD documented $314 billion in ODA during 2019–2020.9  Christian Broadcasting Network Inc 990 Tax Returns, 2019 and 2020. ProPublica - Nonprofit Explorer.

In 2019–2020, all global LGBTI foundation funding—including funds focused on the United States—accounted for less than 35 cents out of every $100 of overall worldwide foundation funding, or .0035 percent. This represented a decrease of 1 cent out of every $100 compared to previous reporting periods.7 In the same two years, global LGBTI funding from donor governments again accounted for .04 cents out of every $100 of international development efforts and assistance (known as ODA), or .0004 percent, maintaining the same level as the previous reporting period.8 Another way to understand the scale of global LGBTI funding is to compare it with just one large organization working to undermine LGBTI human rights, the Christian Broadcast Network (CBN). This organization, founded in 1960 by the notoriously homophobic Pat Robertson, reported expenses of over $622 million in 2019 and 2020.9 In comparison, the entire global LGBTI movement received a documented total of $576 million during the same years.CHART 2.1: GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  COMPARISON TO OVERALL FUNDING (2019–2020)$100 $1004¢35¢FOUNDATIONOVERALL FUNDINGGOVERNMENTLGBTI FUNDING18 192019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureThe Big PictureOverview of Funding by Geographic FocusIn addition to the global overview section, the report provides greater detail on funding within three different geographic scopes.10Funding for LGBTI Issues in the Global South and East: This section provides an analysis of funding for five world regions: (1) Asia and the Pacific; (2) Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Russia; (3) Latin America and the Caribbean; (4) the Middle East and North Africa; and (5) Sub-Saharan Africa.Funding for LGBTI Issues in the Global North. This section analyzes of funding for two major world regions: (1) Northern America11 and (2) Western Europe.12Funding for International LGBTI Issues. This section analyzes funding focused on LGBTI issues at the international level. This includes advocacy for the inclusion of LGBTI issues in international bodies and instruments, and also work to strengthen the capacity of LGBTI movements across multiple regions of the world when inclusive of regions in the Global South and East and those in the Global North.I II IIIDuring 2019 and 2020, about $184 million, or 32 percent of all funding for LGBTI issues, was focused on LGBTI communities in the Global South and East. Compared to the last reporting period, funding for the Global South and East increased by over $10 million, or 6 percent.In the same period, about $361 million, or 63 percent of all funding for LGBTI issues, was focused on LGBTI communities in the Global North, representing an increase of around $38 million and 12 percent compared to the previous report. Of that total, the United States received $328 million, an increase of 10 percent from the last reporting period.The remaining $31 million of funding, or 5 percent, focused on LGBTI issues at the international or multiregional level, generally through funding to international advocacy organizations. Funding for this international work decreased by $32 million, or 51 percent, compared to 2017–2018.13NOTE: In many cases, grantee location details are not disclosed out of concern for safety and security due to hostile environments. In some cases, donors are able to share the world region or global focus of the grant, but are not able to reveal the grantee’s location or the work’s country focus.10  The grouping of countries into regions and sub-regions is based on a review of several similar taxonomies, including the United Nations and other international bodies, as well as existing philanthropic researchers, including Candid Foundation Maps and Human Rights Funders Network. The full geographic taxonomy is included in Appendix Three.11  This report offers a limited analysis of funding focused on Northern America. For a detailed report tracking funding focused on the United States, developed by Funders for LGBTQ Issues, see https://lgbtfunders.org/research/12  The Global Resources Report defines the Global North as countries in Northern America (the United States and Canada) and Western Europe. The division of Global North and Global South countries was first proposed in 1980 through the Independent Commission on International Development Issues (known as the Brandt Commission), with countries such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand included as Global North countries. For the purposes of this report, these countries are included within the Global South and East analysis in the Asia and Pacific world region.13  Readers may note differences in funding totals between the Global Focus and World Region categories. This is due to the specificity of available grant data at different levels of the taxonomy. For example, in some cases it was possible to identify a grant as having a global focus in the Global South and East, yet the funding was directed to multiple world regions. In this report, for the first time, multiregional funding in the Global South and East is featured as a specific “snapshot” due to the significant amount assigned to this geographic focus in 2019–2020.

This represented a regional increase of about $29 million from the previous report and an increase from 53 percent of the total in 2017–2018.Note (in Chart 2.2) that when funds awarded for regranting and funds focused on the United States are both excluded, as is often the case in this report, the total LGBTI funding for 2019–2020 has decreased compared to the previous report. This is due to a decrease of about $10.5 million focused on the international level. Funding with this geographic focus accounted for 9 percent of the global total in 2019–2020, decreasing from 12 percent in the previous report.22 232019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureThe Big Picture$328,902,270$299,746,424$287,307,848$218,495,205$43,045,010$39,019,673$19,941,299$17,683,291$53,125,539$71,706,407$50,382,194$43,523,123$28,260,763$31,488,707$22,267,435$32,483,207$28,141,692$23,221,859$19,336,445$28,495,238$8,789,906$7,244,554$6,873,531$6,554,547$31,979,939$23,398,232$24,444,469$17,267,263$54,011,306$64,465,813$71,962,440$55,573,129INTERNATIONAL/MULTIREGIONAL14WESTERN EUROPENORTHERN AMERICAMIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICAEASTERN EUROPE, CENTRAL ASIA AND RUSSIALATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEANSUB-SAHARAN AFRICAASIA AND PACIFICCHART 2.4: GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  REGIONAL FOCUS (2013–2020)2019–20202017–20182015–20162013–201414  In addition to funds with a whole region focus, this row includes a small amount of funds where the geographic sub-region was not disclosed by the reporting donor. 52world regions showed an increase in funds awarded with a geographic focus. world regions showed a decrease in 2019–2020.• Funds focused on Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Russia increased by about $5 million and accounted for 5 percent of the global total, increasing from 4 percent in the previous report. • Funds focused on Latin America and the Caribbean increased by about $4 million and accounted for 7 percent of the global total, maintaining the previous report level.• Funds focused on the Middle East and North Africa increased by about $1.5 million and accounted for 2 percent of the global total, increasing from 1 percent in the previous report.• Funds focused on Western Europe increased by about $8.6 million and accounted for 6 percent of the global total, increasing from 4 percent in the previous report. • Funds focused on Asia and the Pacific decreased by about $3.2 million and accounted for 5 percent of the global total, decreasing from 6 percent in the previous report.•  Funds focused on Sub-Saharan Africa decreased by about $18.6 million and accounted for 9 percent of the global total, decreasing from 13 percent in the previous report.Funding with an International or multiregional focus also decreased by about $10.5 million and accounted for 9 percent of the global total, decreasing from 12 percent in the previous report.

However, correspondence between GPP and the Belgian government during the 2017–2018 period confirmed awards that were made in 2019. Additional grants were identified by submissions from other grantmakers who reported that the Belgian government was the original source of funding for grants that they had awarded. 18  As measured by total international development assistance (ODA) in 2020. 19  A program of Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.For consistency, this report presents all LGBTI funding originating from various government departments and agencies within a country under one consolidated umbrella of their national government (e.g., Government of Norway instead of the Norway Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway Agency for Development Cooperation). While some government funders submitted consolidated grants data for all of their agencies, in some cases, government agencies individually submitted data on their LGBTI grants. •The report generally includes funding from donor governments only when grants were reported directly by the government.17 Some government funding may be underreported due to the absence of participation by government entities.  •Donor government funding to support domestic programs is not included in our methodology. Likewise, grants to intermediary funders based in-country to regrant for domestic programs are also excluded.

However, as net ODA is a globally recognized indicator of a donor’s level of funding commitment to address development and human rights issues outside of its domestic jurisdiction, analyzing reported LGBTI funding as a percentage of net ODA provides an indication of the extent to which LGBTI issues are prioritized in a country’s development cooperation. 34 352019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureThe Big PictureTOP RECIPIENTS OF LGBTI FUNDINGExcluding funding focused on the United StatesOver the two-year period of 2019–2020, over 2,360 organizations received funding for LGBTI work focused outside of the United States.The top 20 grant recipients received close to $59 million, or 17 percent of the funding, decreasing from 20 percent in 2017–2018. The list includes seven organizations based in the Global South and East. Additionally, 10 of the top 20 grant recipients are organizations focused specifically on LGBTI communities, while 10 have a wider mission.While the list below excludes known regranting income, 11 of the top 20 global grant recipients are intermediary grantmakers.For a list of the top grant recipients that includes funding focused on the United States, turn to page 112 for a closer look at funding for the Global North or see Funders for LGBTQ Issues’ 2019 and 2020 annual tracking reports documenting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer grantmaking by U.S. foundations.22NOTE: As a reminder, the list below shows the total amount of funds committed over the two years of 2019–2020, including the full amount of any multiyear grants awarded during those years. As such, recipients receiving grants awarded for a period of three years or more may have their totals listed below exceed their total two-year operating revenue.22  Find the most recent Tracking Report: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations at https://lgbtfunders.org/research.23  Organizations listed as intermediary grantmakers are known to receive funds awarded for regranting and provide smaller grants to other organizations. For more information about this type of funding flow, see GPP’s Diving Deeper: Under the Surface of Intermediary Funding Data at https://globalphilanthropyproject.org/diving-deeper/#intermed. Those identified as LGBTI organizations have a primary focus on LGBTI human rights.24  COC totals include funds awarded to COC for consortium programs (including the Power of Pride Strategic Partnership with Civil Society, and a partnership with M-PACT).25  For various programs, primarily to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Inclusive Governance Initiative. UNDP is a grantmaker; however, it is not a reporting donor in this edition of the Global Resources Report.26  In English: Terra Nuova Center for Solidarity and Cooperation Among Peoples.27  Funds awarded to a consortium of international LGBT+ and women’s rights NGOs, including Kaleidoscope Trust, Human Dignity Trust, Royal Commonwealth Society, and Sisters for Change.28  These grantees are anonymized either by the grantees themselves or by the reporting donors, out of concern for safety and security due to operating within hostile environments. As a result, this report cannot distinguish the number of grantees receiving these grants, and they are all anonymized in the dataset. For this reason, the number of grantees is surely greater for each year than the numbers documented in this report.NOTE: Globally, anonymous grant recipients received close to 1,700 grants for a total of almost $39 million over the two-year period of 2019–2020.28CHART 5: GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  TOP 20 GRANT RECIPIENTS (2019–2020)23Grantee Name Total Amount Intermediary GrantmakerLGBTI1 COC Netherlands24 $12,924,503 Y Y2 Hivos $5,700,236 Y3 Equitas–International Center for Human Rights Education $5,106,784 Y4 OutRight Action International $5,022,057 Y Y5 Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice $2,864,291 Y Y6 United Nations Development Programme25 $2,728,890 Y7The Southern African Human Rights Litigation Center Trust$2,323,3348Terra Nuova Centro per la Solidarietà e la Cooperazione tra i Popoli26$2,248,6759 UHAI–The East African Sexual Health and Rights Initiative $2,066,140 Y Y10 Equality and Justice Alliance (Consortium)27 $2,049,499 Y11ILGA World–The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association$1,850,860 Y12 Frontline AIDS $1,788,296 Y13 Micro Rainbow International $1,832,837 Y Y14Kaos Gay and Lesbian Cultural Research and Solidarity Association$1,685,653 Y15 Fundación Igualdad LGBT $1,649,636 Y16 ILGA–Europe $1,491,877 Y Y17 Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum $1,431,02718 Amnesty International $1,421,88419 Caribe Afirmativo $1,414,120 Y20 RNW Media $1,363,87036 372019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureThe Big PictureCHART 6.1 GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING DONOR TYPE (2013–2020)CHART 6.2 GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  INTERMEDIARY DONOR TYPE (2013–2020)SOURCES OF GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDINGExcluding funding focused on the United StatesAll types of donors increased their global LGBTI funding between 2017–2018 and 2019–2020, except for corporate foundation grantmaking and anonymous funders.29 In 2019–2020, most global LGBTI funding was again provided by foundations of all kinds. Funding from government and multilateral donors provided 41 percent of the worldwide total, an increase from 37 percent in the previous report.Within the category of Public Foundations, it is notable that intermediary funders (intermediary foundations and NGOs) have increased their total amount of funding and their percentage of the total over time.29  In this edition of the report and retroactively, anonymous funders who are known to the analysts are now coded as their known type of donor so that only those entirely anonymous are included in this category.Public Foundations and NGO Intermediaries Private FoundationsCorporate FundersAnonymous TotalGovernment and Multilateral Agencies$108,231,784$138,067,309$123,665,664$126,244,719$92,121,989$105,386,212$64,792,888$44,668,205$81,971,780$87,644,253$64,677,402$56,262,997$13,116,944$7,630,274$10,683,505$10,008,072$944,500$0$0$2,350$296,386,997$338,728,048$263,819,459$237,186,343$47,457,668$45,627,167$34,865,345$33,121,713$32,310,899$21,963,033$14,265,625$7,188,803Intermediary NGO Percentage of the TotalIntermediary Public FoundationTOTAL17% 19% 23% 24%$79,768,567$67,590,200$49,130,970$40,310,51638 392019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureThe Big Picture9%2%In the eight years of LGBTI funding analyzed in this report, including funding focused on the United States, corporate funding has ranged from 6 percent to 13 percent of the total LGBTI funding and reached its highest level yet in 2019–2020 at $84 million. While significant, corporate foundations maintain the lowest amount of all donor types. In recent years, many corporations have announced public support of LGBTI issues and demonstrated that support through employee resources, participation in and sponsorship of Pride events, and more. Yet, despite this growing field of LGBTI-affirming companies, there is little transparency or public accounting to document the full scope of associated financial resources, and this is especially true for funding outside of the United States.Digging deeper into the data that has been documented in the Global Resources Report over time, it becomes clear that funding focused on the United States has accounted for the great majority of reported corporate support. Funds focused on all other countries have reached as high as $13 million but have dropped to $7.6 million in this reporting period.Moreover, the vast majority (94 percent) of documented corporate funding focused outside of the United States over the past eight years was awarded by only four funders, each primarily focused on HIV/AIDS: Gilead Sciences, Levi Strauss Foundation, M.A.C. AIDS Fund, and ViiV Healthcare.In this edition of the report, Gilead Sciences, M.A.C.

Other changes are reflections of which funders are included in the report. Many changes point to trends emerging from the 2020 pandemic response and other emergent disasters when many human rights funders moved resources toward humanitarian response and relief aid at unprecedented levels. • The greatest of these is a decrease of over $17 million in the Other Issues category, due primarily to improvements in the data collection and analysis processes, which have enabled more specific and accurate coding. • Similarly, a decrease of almost $9 million in funding focused on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights is due in large part to increased discernment and exclusion of grants that were inclusive but not focused on LGBTI communities.• For instance, in the case of HIV/AIDS funding, the documented decrease is in part due to some large HIV-focused funders being included in the previous edition of this report but not in this edition.31• This can be seen in the increased funding for a new issue-level category of Humanitarian Response, added for this report to reflect funding that directly provided food, shelter, cash assistance, access to medications, and other basic needs in the context of the pandemic and different disaster response. • Similarly, funding increased for issues such as Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Suicide Prevention, and grants for Community Building/Empowerment, which often focused on resources for meeting LGBTI community and organizational needs during COVID-related isolation. • General Human Rights and HIV/AIDS were also among the highest levels of strategic funding documented as COVID-impacted.  • Funding also increased for Immigration and Refugee Issues, reaching the highest level documented in this report edition. This correlates to the rise in funding focused on the subpopulation of LGBTI immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.31  See BEHIND THE NUMBERS: Which Funders Are Missing from This Report? on page 134 for more information. $157,029,844$143,478,762$169,339,329$153,043,339$40,831,171$58,805,510$71,914,291$88,149,686$3,484,660$11,522,609$16,510,256$1,711,108$1,643,027$2,786,724$3,543,827$5,261,770Capacity Building OtherGeneral operationProgram42 432019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureThe Big PictureCHART 8.2: GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  SUB-ISSUE ADDRESSED (2017–2020)Issues and Sub-Issues 2017–2018 2019–2020Confronting Discrimination and Violence $10,561,976 4% $11,723,220 5%Anti-Violence $6,938,804 3% $5,540,122 2%Confronting Homophobia, Biphobia, Transphobia, and Interphobia32 $3,623,172 1% $6,183,098 2%Economic Issues $3,115,896 1% $4,049,461 2%Food Security $200 <1% $292,939 <1%Housing and Homelessness $549,555 <1% $1,593,067 <1%Labor/Employment $2,566,142 1% $2,163,455 1%Education/Safe Schools $3,690,698 1% $2,760,290 1%Education $288,588 <1% $23,637 <1%Safe Schools $3,402,110 1% $2,736,653 1%Health and Wellbeing $44,531,569 17% $42,819,476 17%Cultural Competence and Data Collection $729,914 <1% $7,370 <1%General Health Services and Health Promotion $4,464,516 2% $564,499 <1%HIV/AIDS $35,012,839 13% $26,285,131 11%Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Suicide Prevention $2,423,732 1% $15,949,588 6%Primary Care – – $12,888 <1%Human Rights $157,344,540 60% $147,756,209 60%Human Rights (General/Other) $116,909,677 45% $110,306,043 44%Challenging Anti-LGBTQI Laws $3,528,092 1% $913,909 <1%Decriminalization and Criminal Justice Reform $493,779 <1% $2,716,911 1%Gender Identity Rights $10,907,059 4% $13,694,288 6%Immigration and Refugee Issues $883,116 <1% $2,909,836 1%Intersex Rights $2,120,231 1% $3,888,511 2%Marriage/Civil Unions $3,420,827 1% $2,158,439 1%Nondiscrimination Protections $2,795,140 1% $717,410 <1%Religious Exemptions $100,000 <1% – –Responding to Anti-Gender Ideology – – $1,310,193 1%Sex Worker Rights $543,686 <1% $403,957 <1%Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights $17,543,501 7% $8,792,878 4%Humanitarian Response – – $3,539,873 1%Humanitarian Response – – $3,539,873 1%Other Issues $19,074,506 7% $1,602,981 1%Multi-Issue $10,458,930 4% $108,501 <1%Philanthropy $8,615,576 3% $1,494,480 1%Strengthening Community, Families, and Visibility $22,988,518 9% $33,914,393 14%Community Building/Empowerment $12,279,363 5% $25,435,691 10%Religion $5,272,142 2% $2,621,998 1%Sports $562,963 <1% $826,202 <1%Strengthening Families $935,130 <1% $637,708 <1%Visibility $3,938,921 2% $4,392,795 2%Total $261,307,703 $248,165,903CHART 8.1:  GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  ISSUE ADDRESSED (2013–2020) 32  Interphobia describes negative attitudes, prejudice, discrimination, or hatred toward people who are or are believed to be intersex.20M200M210M220M230M240M250M260M40M 60M 80M 100M 120M 140M 160M0Human Rights2013-2014$202,988,7022015-2016$216,593,6052017-2018$261,307,7032019-2020$248,165,903Health and WellbeingConfronting Discrimination and ViolenceStrengthening Community, Families, and VisibilityEconomic IssuesEducation/Safe SchoolsHumanitarian ResponseOther IssuesTotal44 452019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureThe Big PictureSTRATEGIES FUNDEDExcluding funding focused on the United StatesReviewing global LGBTI funding by strategic focus, there are again a number of changes compared to the previous report that are partly due to methodological improvements. Similar to the issue area change, a decrease of over $14 million in the Multi/Other category and over $18 million in the Philanthropy sub-strategy is in large part due to improvements in the data collection and analysis processes, which have enabled more specific and accurate coding. And as in the changes in issues, an increase of over $25.5 million in resources to the strategy of Direct Service points to the emergent needs of LGBTI community members during the 2020 pandemic response and other crises, when many human rights funders moved resources toward humanitarian response and relief aid at unprecedented levels. In addition to Direct Service, the highest levels of strategic funding documented as COVID-impacted were Advocacy, Organizational Capacity Building, and Community Organizing. One more notable decrease that the demands of humanitarian response may explain is a drop of almost $7 million toward research, reaching the lowest level documented in this edition of the report. +$25 MDirect Service Funding2019-20202017-2018CHART 9.1 GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING STRATEGIC FOCUS (2013–2020)Multi/Other Philanthropy and FundraisingDirect ServiceCapacity Building and TrainingResearch Victim SupportTotalCulture and MediaAdvocacy46 472019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureThe Big PictureCHART 9.2: GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  SUB-STRATEGY FOCUS (2017–2020)Strategies and Sub-Strategies 2017–2018 2019–2020Advocacy $148,039,229 57% $157,669,838 64%Advocacy $114,533,192 44% $130,339,064 53%Community Organizing $16,242,581 6% $22,095,854 9%Intergovernmental Advocacy $3,958,583 2% $393,605 <1%Litigation $4,538,663 2% $2,909,618 1%Public Education $8,766,210 3% $1,931,696 1%Capacity Building and Training $28,782,854 11% $18,566,444 7%Conferences/Seminars/Travel Grants $2,906,963 1% $2,507,377 1%Leadership Development $2,450,459 1% $2,056,743 1%Organizational Capacity Building $18,305,002 7% $9,841,046 4%Training/Technical Assistance $5,120,430 2% $4,161,278 2%Culture and Media $4,643,478 2% $6,136,016 2%Culture $2,944,438 1% $4,310,658 2%Electronic Media/Online Services $668,611 <1% $678,100 <1%Film/Video/Radio $1,030,429 <1% $1,147,257 <1%Direct Service $23,209,136 9% $48,740,474 20%Direct Service $23,209,136 9% $48,740,474 20%Multi/Other $21,030,500 8% $6,607,848 3%Multi-Strategy $14,398,158 6% $2,497,159 1%Other $6,632,342 3% $4,110,688 2%Philanthropy and Fundraising $24,193,937 9% $5,966,492 2%Fundraising Event $138,275 <1% $32,654 <1%Philanthropy $24,055,662 9% $5,933,839 2%Research $10,749,141 4% $3,758,048 1%Publications $90,517 <1% $25,081 <1%Research $10,658,624 4% $3,732,967 1%Victim Support $659,428 0% $720,743 0%Victim Support $659,428 <1% $720,743 <1%Total $261,307,703 $248,165,903POPULATION FOCUSExcluding funding focused on the United StatesThe vast majority of grants awarded to LGBTI issues did not focus on a specific LGBTI population. These grants totaled over $209 million, or 84 percent of the total funding. This included funds focused on the full LGBTI community, a mixed group within the LGBTI community, or where no specific sub-population focus was disclosed. For these grants, there is no accurate way to estimate how they reached particular populations within the LGBTI community or focused on their unique needs.

Another $31.7 million was awarded with no focus on sexual orientation. This indicates that the grants were instead focused on gender identity or sex characteristics. Funding that specifically focused on gay and bisexual men, queer men, and men who have sex with men (MSM) totaled $19 million, or eight percent of total LGBTI funding. This represents a decrease in total Over the two years of 2019–2020, funding outside the United States specifically focused on transgender communities33 totaled $28.9 million—representing 12 percent of all funding for LGBTI issues.34 This represents an increase in total funds and percentage compared to the previous reporting period.funds and percentage compared to the previous report. Notably, most funding for gay and bisexual men, queer men, and MSM was again devoted to the sub-issue of HIV/AIDS (85 percent) and the sub-strategy of Direct Service (62 percent). Funding focused on lesbian and bisexual women and queer women totaled $19 million, or eight percent of LGBTI funding, representing a slight increase in both total funds and percentage.Funding focused on bisexual communities is included within the categories of General LGBQ, gay and bisexual men, and lesbian and bisexual women. Worldwide (excluding the United States), only $35,000 was specifically bisexual-focused, representing eight grants.Funding by Sexual Orientation Funding by Gender Identity 33  In this report, we use transgender (or abbreviated as trans) as an umbrella term including people who are transgender, non-binary, gender nonconforming, or other terms indicating a sense of one’s own gender that differs from one’s assigned sex at birth. While some grants do specify a focus on trans women, trans men, and other subgroups within this umbrella, those funding levels are small enough to report as one population in this document. 34  Readers may note that the amount awarded to General LGBQ differs from the amounts not based on gender identity and the amounts not based on sex characteristics. This is due to grants coded to multiple populations. While this reporting methodology generally attempts to identify a primary focus population for each grant, in the case of grants identifying populations explicitly intersecting across sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics—such as “LBT women” or “trans and intersex”—in some cases a grant may be coded to multiple subpopulations based on the grant and organization descriptions. In the case of especially large grants, the coding may be split into multiple subpopulations.

Devex, an organization tracking global development funding, documented government funding announcements in 2020 of $12.2 trillion, with another $7.7 trillion announced by multilateral agencies and $1.1 trillion reported by nonprofits, philanthropy, the private sector, and others. In total, these announcements represent $21 trillion in COVID-response funding committed in 2020 alone.35 In their report Philanthropy and COVID-19: Measuring One Year of Giving, the Center for Disaster Philanthropy and Candid together documented over $20 billion in overall COVID funding awarded specifically by foundations, corporations, and high net wealth individuals in 2020. While U.S. donors comprised 77 percent of funding dollars documented in this report, data from over 140 countries was included. The report also notes that of this total, $4 billion was awarded by one individual donor, MacKenzie Scott.35  A year of COVID funding: Priorities and what lies next. (2021).

More than 80 percent reported that many or most of their grantee partners had shifted focus from existing programs to providing services to reduce the spread of COVID-19 among their community, and more than 80 percent had reoriented from existing programs to providing livelihood, shelter, legal assistance, or other forms of support to address the impact of COVID-19. This indicated an emerging trend: as already overburdened LGBTI organizations and their funders shifted to support the urgent needs of LGBTI response to COVID-19, the work—and funding—of ongoing campaigns for essential LGBTI human rights and other longtime priorities could be dangerously under-resourced.In July 2020, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs released an updated UN COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP), which outlined a coordinated response plan for the international humanitarian system and acknowledged that LGBTI communities are a group in particular need of protection against the impact of the pandemic. It also stated that humanitarian actors must take steps to address their needs.GPP’s report Where Are the Global COVID-19 Resources for LGBTI Communities?36 was published in early 2021 and confirmed what many in the sector had discussed anecdotally: that governments, donors, and service providers have largely failed to acknowledge or address the specific needs of LGBTI people in response to COVID-19; that LGBTI organizations had mobilized to fill this void out of necessity, providing for basic needs, support, and protection for their communities, without sufficient support from traditional development agencies; and that philanthropic support for LGBTI communities has remained stable, with funders offering flexibility to meet the moment; however, this results in significant human rights-focused funding being redirected to humanitarian service provisions.Where Are the Global COVID-19 Resources analyzed 4,467 recorded COVID-19 resource mechanisms and found that only one explicitly described funding to support LGBTI communities. None of the almost 3,000 documented resource mechanisms tracked to the UN’s Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) explicitly described funding to support LGBTI communities.The 2019–2020 Global Resources Report is the first opportunity to document and assess the existing COVID-19 resources focused on global LGBTI communities. For several reasons, this analysis is limited. These numbers only reflect grants that explicitly noted a relationship to COVID in their grant description or other submitted information. However, our previous research indicated that many funders increased grants or enabled grantees to shift a program grant to general operating expenses.37 This kind of funding response may not be represented. Additionally, many grants are submitted with limited descriptions or anonymized information, which does not enable analysts to identify the funding as related to COVID response.Still, reviewing all global LGBTI funding, excluding grants focused on the United States, this report documented over 850 grants representing over $14.7 million for grants related to COVID-19 impacts on LGBTI communities, or 11 percent of the total. This includes grants from all types of foundations and government and multilateral agencies and excludes funds awarded for regranting.3836  Where Are the Global COVID-19 Resources for LGBTI Communities?

LGBTI funding documented from the 360Giving database was entirely (100 percent) focused on work in the United Kingdom. As a result, funding for the United Kingdom is overrepresented because of having more infrastructure for transparent foundation grant reporting than other countries.Sexual Orientation70%11%24% 27%18% 8% 8%10% 7%Gender IdentityHumanitarian Response Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Suicide PreventionGeneral Human Rights Community Building/Empowerment HIV/AIDSSex CharacteristicsGeneral LGBQTLB GB• Public foundations and intermediary NGOs awarded the majority of global LGBTI COVID-related funding (65 percent).

Governments and multilateral agencies accounted for 12 percent, while corporations accounted for 2 percent.

Eleven percent of the funding was focused on the international level, such as advocacy for the inclusion of LGBTI issues in international bodies or work to strengthen the capacity of LGBTI movements across multiple regions of the world (across the Global South and East and the Global North).• Similarly, the largest amount of COVID-related funding was directed to the sub-strategies of Direct Service (51 percent), Advocacy (9 percent), Organizational Capacity Building (9 percent), and Community Organizing (8 percent). • Funding to different groups within the LGBTI community tracked closely to their overall funding percentages.

For this report, the Global South and East encompasses Asia and the Pacific; Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Russia; Latin America and the Caribbean; the Middle East and North Africa; and Sub-Saharan Africa. These regions include most of the world’s lower-income and middle-income countries and a small number of higher-income countries. They are home to around 91 percent of the global population yet received 32 percent of LGBTI funding in this period.40Compared to the last reporting period, funding for LGBTI issues in the Global South and East increased by over $10 million, or 6 percent. Funding for LGBTI issues in the Global South and East has fluctuated considerably over the eight years documented, in part due to the impact of large multiyear grants that are counted in the year awarded.40  Data retrieved March 24, 2022. https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-region/CHART 12: GLOBAL SOUTH AND EAST LGBTI FUNDING  |  YEAR (2013–2020)2013 | 2014 $43,348,022 $85,431,382 $128,779,404$71,716,455 $47,084,450 $118,800,905$83,187,674 $90,590,931 $173,778,605$81,341,537 $102,837,079 $184,178,6162015 | 20162017 | 20182019 | 20202019-2020 $184 millionfunding4,500grants632019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesFunding for LGBTI Issues in the Global South and EastNOTE: Anonymous donors awarded close to $17 million during this period.

All of the top 10 funders were based in the Global North.The top 10 grant recipients of LGBTI funding for work focused on the Global South and East received over $33 million, or 18 percent of the total, maintaining the same percentage level as the previous report while increasing their total funding.These totals include the full amount of any multiyear grants awarded over the two-year period of 2019–2020. As such, recipients receiving grants awarded for a period of three years or more may have their totals listed below exceed their total two-year operating revenue.

The total funding in 2019–2020 focused on the Global South and East including regranting comes to $259,384,951.42  COC totals include funds awarded to COC for consortium programs (including the Power of Pride Strategic Partnership with Civil Society, and a partnership with M-PACT).43  For various programs, primarily to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Inclusive Governance Initiative.44  These grantees are anonymized either by the grantees themselves or by the reporting donors, out of concern for safety and security due to operating within hostile environments. As a result, this report cannot distinguish the number of grantees receiving these grants, and they are all included within the name “Anonymous” in the dataset. For this reason, the number of grantees is surely greater for each year than the numbers documented in this report. 64 652019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesFunding for LGBTI Issues in the Global South and East Funding for LGBTI Issues in the Global South and EastDuring 2019–2020, most funding focused on the Global South and East was awarded by foundations of all types, while 42 percent of LGBTI funding for the Global South and East was awarded by government and multilateral agencies.

Funding focused on intersex communities increased in amount and percentage compared to the previous report.“Spotlight” population groups are used to highlight funding for specific populations within the LGBTI community. In this edition of the report, the focus on people living with HIV or AIDS (PLWHA); people of faith; and immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers has been added in part because (as in the previously included groups) these are known communities of focus within LGBTI and adjacent grantmaking networks and increasing the visibility of this data can support those efforts.Each of the spotlighted populations maintained a similar portion of the total LGBTI funding from the previous report, with notable increases in the total amount for children and youth, and for immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. Funding decreased for PLWHA and for people of faith. Funding focused on sex workers stayed relatively consistent.

GPP is internationally recognized as the primary thought leader and go-to partner for donor coordination around global LGBTI work.GPP is a key source of strategic research and analysis for global LGBTI funders, including the production of the biennial Global Resources Report. It plays a central role in convening philanthropists and human rights activists for opportunities to increase knowledge, skills, and capacities When analyzing all global funding excluding grants focused on the United States, GPP members collectively awarded over $82 million and accounted for one-third of all LGBTI grants in 2019–2020 and nearly half of the total LGBTI funding by foundations.  toward expanding global LGBTI funding. These convening spaces include donor pre-conferences during regional LGBTI convenings, funder webinars, and report release events.GPP and its members and partners work together to mobilize and activate new resources for global LGBTI communities. One key area of this work is the Government and Multilateral Task Force, which includes sub-committees focused on several priority donor governments. The efforts of this task force have been pivotal within broader efforts leading to significant LGBTI funding commitments.Analyzing funding focused on the Global South and East, GPP members collectively awarded over $64 million and accounted for 35 percent of all LGBTI funding to this global focus area, or half of the total LGBTI funding by foundations. Similarly, GPP’s Trans and Intersex Funding Task Force has been active since 2015, developing research and convenings to make the case for increased funding for these populations, and other advocacy. In that same time, GPP has mobilized philanthropic response to the weaponization of gender against LGBTI people and democracy. Currently, GPP maintains a task force focused on philanthropic responses to the “anti-gender” movement. Each of GPP’s 22 members shared their LGBTI grant data for inclusion in this report.

GPP member funding was a smaller percentage of funding focused on gay and bisexual men, queer men, and MSM communities. This is largely due to the majority of this funding being focused on HIV. In contrast, no GPP member’s funding primarily focuses on HIV or AIDS.

That is partly due to a significant amount of funding related to marriage or civil unions in 2017–2018. The decrease in funding focused on marriage equality and a reduction in funding focused on HIV/AIDS are some of the main reasons for this region's overall decrease in funding.• Decreases in Other Issues are largely due to methodological improvements; however, funding for the sub-issue of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights slightly increased in this region, while decreasing at the broader geographic level.Issues Addressed by LGBTI Funding LGBTI Funding for Asia and the for Asia and the PacificPacific, by Recipient LocationSri Lanka $657,171Australia $556,722Taiwan $498,800Japan $459,615Fiji $375,338Nepal $374,635Cambodia $211,081Malaysia $191,045Singapore $179,529South Korea $128,154Mongolia $109,500Laos $77,573Tonga $66,118Bhutan $57,866Timor-Leste $43,403Kiribati $43,209Vanuatu $31,813Papua New Guinea $12,750Multiple countries $6,236,395Country not disclosed $830,6960.2M 0.4M 0.6M 0.8M 1M 1.2M 1.4M 1.6M 1.8M 2M 2.2M 2.4M 2.6M 2.8M 3M 3.2M 3.4M 3.6M 3.8M 4M 4.2M $4.4M78 792019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesSNAPSHOT: LGBTI Funding for Asia and the Pacific SNAPSHOT: LGBTI Funding for Asia and the PacificCHART 18.6: ASIA AND THE PACIFIC LGBTI FUNDING  |  ISSUE ADDRESSED (2017–2020) Issues and Sub-Issues 2017–2018 2019–2020Confronting Discrimination and Violence $2,071,428 7% $2,280,529 8%Anti-Violence $1,783,236 6% $381,720 1%Confronting Homophobia, Biphobia, Transphobia, and Interphobia $288,193 1% $1,898,809 7%Economic Issues $25,746 <1% $467,536 2%Housing and Homelessness $1,353 <1% $93,580 <1%Labor/Employment $24,393 <1% $373,956 1%Education/Safe Schools $646,196 2% $425,049 2%Education $161,191 1% - -Safe Schools $485,005 2% $425,049 2%Health and Wellbeing $6,518,008 21% $4,200,292 15%General Health Services and Health Promotion $694,934 2% $154,860 1%HIV/AIDS $5,798,074 18% $3,330,708 12%Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Suicide Prevention - - $701,836 2%Primary Care - - $12,888 <1%Cultural Competence and Data Collection $25,000 <1% - -Human Rights $17,569,812 56% $16,032,670 57%Human Rights (General/Other) $13,020,052 41% $11,287,896 40%Challenging Anti-LGBTQI Laws $208,749 1% - -Decriminalization and Criminal Justice Reform $69,810 <1% $321,609 <1%Gender Identity Rights $1,284,818 4% $1,757,482 6%Immigration and Refugee Issues - - $28,939 <1%Intersex Rights $297,958 1% $818,116 3%Marriage/Civil Unions $2,024,810 6% $797,882 3%Nondiscrimination Protections $353,220 1% $114,358 <1%Responding to Anti-Gender Ideology - - $4,000 <1%Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights $158,633 <1% $832,995 3%Sex Worker Rights $151,762 <1% $69,393 <1%Humanitarian Response - - $654,568 2%Humanitarian Response - - $654,568 2%Other Issues $3,171,333 10% $12,760 <1%Multi-Issue $3,149,730 10% - -Philanthropy $21,603 <1% $12,760 <1%Strengthening Community, Families, and Visibility $1,486,184 5% $4,187,359 15%Community Building/Empowerment $1,153,158 4% $3,652,470 13%Religion $73,764 <1% $71,361 <1%Sports $19,244 <1% $19,570 <1%Strengthening Families $57,060 <1% $27,448 <1%Visibility $182,959 1% $416,510 1%Total $31,488,707 $28,260,763Population Focus of LGBTI Funding for Asia and the PacificCHART 18.7: ASIA AND THE PACIFIC LGBTI FUNDING  |  SELECTED POPULATION FOCUS (2017–2020)In 2019-2020, the majority of funding in this region maintained a \"General LGBQ\" focus – totaling $17.8 million.$2,943,554$5,500,730$3,864,756$367,267$2,120,221$23,617$4,741,861$85,264$673,030$2,840,807$2,754,147$3,906,124$1,131,485$3,223,732$56,666$3,267,273$28,742$547,32480 812019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesSNAPSHOT: LGBTI Funding for Asia and the Pacific SNAPSHOT: LGBTI Funding for Asia and the PacificOver the two-year period of 2019–2020, 56 grantmakers awarded $28,141,693 focused on LGBTI issues in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Russia.

The total multiregional funding for the Global South and East in 2019–2020 including regranting comes to nearly $67 million.55  As a reminder, readers may note differences in funding totals for international funding at the Global Focus level and multiregional funding at the World Region level, and in this case multiregional funding within the Global South and East. This is due to the specificity of available grant data at different levels of the taxonomy. For example, in some cases it was possible to identify a grant as having a Global Focus in the Global South and East, yet the funding was directed to multiple regions such as funds for a program in both Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Funding focused Internationally would instead be something that impacts or is focused globally, or in both the Global South and East and the Global North, such as a global conference or a program taking place in Western Europe and in Asia.NOTE: Anonymous donors awarded around $1.7 million to this region in 2019–2020. Collectively, these anonymous grants rank as the fifth-largest source of LGBTI funding for this geographic focus.CHART 23.3: GLOBAL SOUTH AND EAST MULTIREGIONAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  GRANTEE LOCATION (2019–2020)2%92%6%UnspecifiedBased Outside the Global South and EastBased in the Global South and East106 1072019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesSNAPSHOT: Multiregional LGBTI Funding for the Global South and EastCHART 23.4: GLOBAL SOUTH AND EAST MULTIREGIONAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  ISSUE ADDRESSED (2019–2020)Issues and Sub-Issues 2019–2020Confronting Discrimination and Violence $225,000 1%Confronting Homophobia, Biphobia, Transphobia, and Interphobia $225,000 1%Economic Issues $179,546 1%Labor/Employment $179,546 1%Health and Wellbeing $4,648,545 20%HIV/AIDS $4,648,545 20%Human Rights $16,925,182 74%Human Rights (General/Other) $15,009,048 66%Decriminalization and Criminal Justice Reform $657,816 3%Gender Identity Rights $390,453 2%Intersex Rights $51,097 <1%Nondiscrimination Protections $541,767 2%Responding to Anti-Gender Ideology $70,000 <1%Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights $205,000 1%Other Issues $483,826 2%Philanthropy $483,826 2%Strengthening Community, Families, and Visibility $353,607 2%Community Building/Empowerment $200,000 1%Religion $131,250 1%Sports $22,357 <1%Total $53,125,539CHART 23.5: GLOBAL SOUTH AND EAST MULTIREGIONAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  SELECTED POPULATION FOCUS (2019–2020)In 2019-2020, the majority of funding in this region had a \"General LGBQ\" focus – totaling $21 million.$1,130,542$317,134$378,464$72,473$142,911$242,911$4,598,224$356,250-108 1092019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesSNAPSHOT: Multiregional LGBTI Funding for the Global South and East SNAPSHOT: Multiregional LGBTI Funding for the Global South and EastThe Amsterdam Network is a group of Global North LGBTI organizations collaborating to influence their governments’ integration of LGBTI rights in foreign policy and development assistance.

Moreover, if an institution reports grantmaking through U.S. 990 tax forms, it is considered U.S.-based for the purposes of this report methodology. 61  In contrast to other calculations in this report, all lists of top funders do include funds awarded for the purpose of regranting, in order to document the full amount of LGBTI funding flowing from (or through) each funder. The total funding for the Global North in 2019–2020 including regranting comes to $406,792,789. This total also includes funding focused on the United States.62  These grantees are anonymized by the reporting donors, out of concern for safety and security due to operating within hostile environments. As a result, this report cannot distinguish the number of grantees receiving these grants, and they are all included within the name “Anonymous” in the dataset. For this reason, the number of grantees is surely greater for each year than the numbers documented in this report.63  These grantees are anonymized either by the grantees themselves or by the reporting donors, out of concern for safety and security due to operating within hostile environments.

Because the U.S. is documented in detail in that report, this section presents an abridged snapshot focused on Canada.Fifteen funders reported 69 grants awarded for work focused on Canada in 2019–2020, totaling nearly $730,000 and representing an increase of 38 percent from the previous reporting period. Of this total, public foundation and intermediary NGO grants accounted for 48 percent of the giving, private foundations totaled 43 percent, and corporate funders totaled 9 percent.Eight of the fifteen grantmakers were based in the United States, with six based in Canada and one based in Norway. There were 55 grantees based in Canada, with 1 based in the United States and 1 with a location that was not disclosed.In 2019–2020, the largest amount and percentage of funding to Canada was focused on Health and Wellbeing, with 75 percent of that total going to the sub-issue of Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Suicide Prevention–issues exacerbated by COVID-19.Funding focused on Lesbian/Bisexual Women/Queer Women accounted for 24 percent of the total, while funding for Gay/Bisexual Men/Queer Men/MSM accounted for 12 percent. Trans funding accounted for seven percent of the Canadian total, while intersex funding accounted for only one percent. Fluctuations in funding focused on Canada compared to prior years were almost entirely the result of shifts in which funders were included in the report–both in terms of increased reporting for LBQ and trans communities and in the absence of a major HIV funder that had been previously included as a large percentage of funding focused on Gay/Bisexual Men/Queer Men/MSM in the country.LGBTI Funding Focused on CanadaIssues Addressed by LGBTI Funding for CanadaPopulation Focus of LGBTI Funding for CanadaIssues 2017–2018 2019–2020Confronting Discrimination & Violence - - $28,730 4%Economic Issues $70,000 13% $35,839 5%Education/Safe Schools - - $8,547 1%Health and Wellbeing $187,135 35% $297,984 41%Human Rights $244,305 46% $160,245 22%Other Issues $10,000 2% $22,765 3%Strengthening Community, Families, and Visibility $18,254 4% $175,571 24%Total $529,694 $729,68169 +38%$730kGrantsFunds118 1192019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesSNAPSHOT: LGBTI Funding for Northern America SNAPSHOT: LGBTI Funding for Northern AmericaOver the two-year period of 2019–2020, 103 grantmakers awarded $31,979,939 focused on LGBTI issues in Western Europe.

LGBTI funding documented from the 360Giving database was entirely (100 percent) focused on work in the United Kingdom and accounted for 71 percent of the total awarded to the U.K. As a result, funding focused on the U.K. is overrepresented because of having more infrastructure for transparent foundation grant reporting than other countries in the region.WESTERN EUROPE (2019–2020)936$34,203$11,285$32 MNUMBER OF GRANTSAVERAGE GRANTMEDIAN GRANTTOTAL FUNDING SNAPSHOT LGBTI Funding for Western EuropeCHART 29.1: WESTERN EUROPE LGBTI FUNDINGYEAR (2013–2020)67CHART 29.2: WESTERN EUROPE LGBTI FUNDINGTOP 10 FUNDERS (2019–2020)68When funds awarded for regranting are included, over $32 million was awarded to grants focused on Western Europe.

Reported funding for international LGBTI issues has decreased during the two previous reporting cycles; however, this is partly due to methodological improvements enabling the identification of a more specific geographic focus in this edition of the report69  Note that this section refers to the Global Focus area of International funding.CHART 30.1 INTERNATIONAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  YEAR (2013–2020)2013 | 2014  $25,362,121  $30,211,010  $55,573,131  $45,849,104  $26,113,335  $71,962,439  $32,348,256  $31,020,151  $63,368,407  $16,035,329  $15,135,109  $31,170,438 2015 | 20162017 | 20182019 | 2020$31.17 M47310fundinggrantmakersgrants2019-20201272019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesFunding for International LGBTI IssuesNOTE: Anonymous funders awarded 13 grants totaling nearly $3.3 million for international LGBTI issues during 2019–2020.

The top 10 funders with that geographic focus awarded over $36 million, accounting for 78 percent of all internationally focused LGBTI funding. Four of these top donors were governments and one was a multilateral agency. Eight of the top ten donors were based in Western Europe, and two were based in the United States.The top 10 grant recipients of LGBTI funding for internationally focused work received a total of over $19 million, or 61 percent of the total. Five of the top ten grant recipients were organizations based in the United States, and five were based in Western Europe. While the list below excludes known regranting, 5 of the top 10 grant recipients are also intermediary grantmakers.Top Funders and Recipients70  In contrast to other calculations in this report, all lists of top funders do include funds awarded for the purpose of regranting, in order to document the full amount of LGBTI funding flowing from (or through) each funder. The total funding for International Issues in 2019–2020 including regranting comes to $46,301,556.71  Funds awarded to consortium of international LGBT+ and women’s rights NGOs, including Kaleidoscope Trust, Human Dignity Trust, Royal Commonwealth Society, and Sisters for Change.72  Funds awarded for the Dignity for All: LGBTI Assistance Program.73  These grantees are anonymized either by the grantees themselves or by the reporting donors, out of concern for safety and security due to operating within hostile environments. As a result, this report cannot distinguish the number of grantees receiving these grants, and they are all included within the name “Anonymous” in the dataset. For this reason, the number of grantees is surely greater for each year than the numbers documented in this report.128 1292019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesFunding for International LGBTI Issues Funding for International LGBTI IssuesDuring 2019–2020, the highest percentage of international LGBTI funding, 60 percent, was awarded by Donor Government and Multilateral Agencies. Private Foundations were the next highest type of funder, at 29 percent.Compared to the two-year period of 2017–2018, all donor types significantly decreased their funding in this geographic focus. As a reminder, this is in part due to methodological improvements enabling the identification of more specific geographic focus in this edition of the report. Reviewing funding for internationally focused LGBTI issues, some similar themes emerge to those noted in the global view, and some specific elements stand out. Again, decreases in Other Issues and the sub-issue of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights are due in large part to methodological improvements that enabled assigning more specific geographic focus. While some funding was assigned to the (new for this report) issue of Humanitarian Response, international LGBTI funding differed from other geographic snapshots by decreasing for the sub-issues of Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Suicide Prevention and Community Building/Empowerment. A number of other decreases stand out in this region, including funding for General Human Rights, HIV/AIDS, and Religion. In the case of internationally focused HIV/AIDS funding, this drop is in part due to some large HIV-focused funders being included in the previous edition of this report but not in this edition.74For Other Issues, these decreases are in large part further impacts of the previously noted methodological improvements.Sources of Funding for Issues Addressed byInternational LGBTI Issues International LGBTI IssuesCHART 30.4: INTERNATIONAL LGBTI FUNDING DONOR TYPE (2017–2020)Government and Multilateral AgenciesPublic Foundations and NGO IntermediariesCorporate FundersPrivate FoundationsAnonymous2019 | 20202017 | 2018$1,985,117$543,979$240,000$0$9,435,662$4,148,406$27,671,182$13,643,593$31,667,071$27,965,57874  See BEHIND THE NUMBERS: Which Funders Are Missing from This Report? on page 134 for more information.130 1312019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesFunding for International LGBTI Issues Funding for International LGBTI IssuesCHART 30.5: INTERNATIONAL LGBTI FUNDING ISSUE AND SUB-ISSUE ADDRESSED (2017–2020)Issues and Sub-Issues 2017–2018 2019–2020Confronting Discrimination and Violence $341,785 1% $1,030,283 3%Anti-Violence $55,285 <1% $879,783 2%Confronting Homophobia, Biphobia, Transphobia, and Interphobia $286,500 <1% $150,500 <1%Economic Issues $159,718 <1% $140,223 <1%Food Security $200 <1% - -Labor/Employment $159,518 <1% $140,223 <1%Education/Safe Schools $74,000 <1% - -Education $64,000 <1% - -Safe Schools $10,000 <1% - -Health and Wellbeing $10,777,277 17% $605,955 2%General Health Services and Health Promotion $50,000 <1% - -HIV/AIDS $10,522,277 17% $605,955 2%Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Suicide Prevention $205,000 <1% - -Human Rights $46,767,585 74% $28,076,524 77%Human Rights (General/Other) $38,424,996 61% $23,632,088 65%Challenging Anti-LGBTQI Laws $773,339 1% $150,000 <1%Decriminalization and Criminal Justice Reform $77,924 <1% $352,000 1%Gender Identity Rights $2,707,782 4% $2,174,103 6%Immigration and Refugee Issues $114,642 <1% $186,869 <1%Intersex Rights $375,029 1% $332,121 1%Marriage/Civil Unions $600,000 1% $225,000 1%Nondiscrimination Protections $50,000 <1% - -Religious Exemptions $100,000 <1% - -Responding to Anti-Gender Ideology - - $337,500 1%Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights $3,543,873 6% $686,843 2%Humanitarian Response - - $545,418 2%Humanitarian Response - - $545,418 2%Other Issues $2,971,592 5% $417,496 1%Multi-Issue $285,286 <1% - -Philanthropy $2,686,307 4% $417,496 1%Strengthening Community, Families, and Visibility $2,186,882 3% $354,539 1%Community Building/Empowerment $242,629 <1% $157,647 <1%Religion $1,192,489 2% $137,642 <1%Strengthening Families $275,000 <1% - -Sports - - $42,069 <1%Visibility $476,764 1% $17,181 <1%Total $63,278,839 $31,170,438Population Focus of International LGBTI FundingCHART 30.6: INTERNATIONAL LGBTI FUNDING  |  SELECTED POPULATION FOCUS (2017–2020)$4,632,943$3,803,158$1,254,402$1,763,368$4,632,943$0In 2019-2020, the majority of funding in this region maintained a \"General LGBQ\" focus – totaling $25.7 million.$1,510,275$1,126,452$7,774,891$312,364$155,117$211,869$729,642$10,515,277$1,446,089$137,642$1,254,402$0132 1332019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesFunding for International LGBTI Issues Funding for International LGBTI IssuesAs in past reports, the most notable gap in this edition of the Global Resources Report is a lack of data on grants awarded by the Government of the United States. This includes the multi-donor LGBTI Global Human Rights Initiative (GHRI), which is managed by USAID, and the Global Equality Fund (GEF), a pooled fund focused on advancing LGBTI rights around the world, housed within the U.S. Department of State. GHRI is a five-year (2019–2024) public-private partnership that leverages financial and technical contributions from multiple parties including the United States, Canada, Sweden, and other public and private donors.75 The GEF receives contributions from the U.S. government as well as following years; however, a 2021 statement from the White House noted that \"Since its launch in 2011, the Global Equality Fund has provided more than $83 million in funding through small grants, emergency and rapid response assistance, and support for more than 50 technical assistance projects in more than 100 countries worldwide.\"77 Unless otherwise noted, when this report presents funding trend lines over time (2013–2020), the funding totals document all data available, including the 2014 and 2015 funding from the U.S. government and the Global Equality Fund.  Based on previous funding and anecdotal information, we estimate about $65 million of LGBTI grants from the U.S. Government and the Global Equality Fund are missing from this 2019–2020 report. This would equal about 9 percent of the total grant amount included in this report (including funds awarded for regranting). This gap is even more prominent in LGBTI funding for the Global South and East, which is where the majority of documented funding from the U.S. Government and Global Equality Fund has been devoted. Adding the full amount of funding from the U.S. Government This edition of the Global Resources Report includes data on LGBTI grants awarded by over 500 funding institutions including foundations, intermediaries, corporations, donor government agencies, and multilateral agencies. However, as with any research effort, there are gaps in the available data.As in previous editions of the report, several funders who are known to have awarded LGBTI grants are not able to be included in cases where funders did not report data directly to the Global Resources Report and no other reliable public documentation of their grantmaking was available.several other government agencies in Europe and Latin America, and from private foundations and corporations.76The U.S. government and the Global Equality Fund provided data to the Global Resources Report for one year, 2014, which was included in the first edition of the report. In that year, the U.S. government awarded $11.1 million in grants focused on LGBTI communities, with an additional $7.6 million in funds awarded through the Global Equality Fund. The Global Equality Fund also reported $10.9 million in grants awarded in 2015 through their public annual report released in 2016. Unfortunately, no public report has been released in the and the Global Equality Fund to the Global South and East totals for 2019–2020 could increase that total by close to one-third. This significant percentage of global LGBTI funding, and especially funding focused on the Global South and East is unfortunately, unable to be publicly documented or incorporated into broader strategic conversations within the philanthropic community. A number of additional governments that have previously been included in the report did not share data for this edition. These are the Government of Chile (previously included in 2015–2016), the Government of France (included in the past three editions), and the Government of Luxembourg (included in the past edition).  Another key multilateral funder missing from this report is the World Bank, which was included in the 2015–2016 and 2017–2018 editions of this report but was not able to share a full data submission for 2019 and 2020. However, the World Bank did report that they had awarded over $6.8 million in global funding focused on LGBTI communities, of which $5.1 million (75 percent) was focused on HIV response. If these funds were included in the dataset at the global level, HIV/AIDS as a sub-issue would have reached the same percentage of total funding as in the previous reporting period.  Further, in the 2017–2018 edition of this report, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was not able to be included in the overall dataset but was featured in a specific “Behind the Numbers” section with a total estimated investment of $108.5 million in HIV programs for gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and for trans communities. This report does not include a similar focus section.BEHIND THE NUMBERSWHICH FUNDERS ARE MISSING FROM THIS REPORT?Government and Multilateral Donors77  Fact Sheet: The Biden-Harris Administration Is Advancing LGBTQI+ Human Rights at Home and Across the Globe.

Accessed April 5, 2022, at https://www.state.gov/global-equality-fund/BEHIND THE NUMBERS  |   WHICH FUNDERS ARE MISSING FROM THIS REPORT?• There are also a number of foundations that reported significant LGBTI grantmaking in previous cycles yet did not report grants awarded in 2019–2020. In many cases, this is due to multiyear funding cycles where a round of previously reported funding is still being disbursed. Among the largest previous reporters not included in this edition of the report are Aids Fondet, Bread for the World, Danish Family Planning Association, and Fondation de France.• GPP also reached out to over 20 wealth advisors or financial management firms inviting them to share information toward documenting the financial impact of such advisories and high net wealth individual donors in funding global LGBTI movements and communities. No new reporting resulted from this outreach. •  Additionally, several key known NGO intermediary regranters were not able to report for this cycle, including All Out, Diakonia, the Eurocentralasian Lesbian* Community (EL*C) Urgent Response Fund, and Rainbow Railroad. • In this edition of the report, GPP also put significant effort into increasing the number of included corporate foundations. Working with the global LGBTQ+ business network Out Leadership,78 GPP and Out Leadership partners reached out personally to representatives of over 25 corporations that had not previously shared grants data. A number of these corporations are also affiliated with LGBTI+ business networks, including Partnership for Global LGBTI Equality (PGLE),79 Open for Business,80 and East Meets West.81 Unfortunately, only one new corporation participated in the report in this edition.• The Equality Without Borders Fund (EWB) again shared their funding impact, reporting over $4.2 million in grants during 2019 and 2020. EWB is an initiative that helps individual donors from multiple countries to support groups from around the world. The combined funding from these donors is not otherwise visible as a distinct entity within this report because these grants are either reported by each independent giving vehicle or included as anonymous funding. These challenges highlight the importance of grantmaker transparency, which must continue to be commonly held as a best practice in the field of LGBTI grantmaking. With future network-building, advocacy, and increased reporting, future editions of this report will continue to expand our abilities to tell the story of the full ecosystem of LGBTI global funding with cohesive, nuanced, and detailed accuracy.Foundations, Wealth Advisors, and Corporations78  https://outleadership.com/  79  https://www.global-lgbti.org/  80  https://open-for-business.org/  81  https://www.eastmeetswest.eu/BEHIND THE NUMBERS  |   WHICH FUNDERS ARE MISSING FROM THIS REPORT?BEHIND THE NUMBERS  |   WHICH FUNDERS ARE MISSING FROM THIS REPORT?MethodologyDEFINING AN LGBTI GRANTThe 2019–2020 Global Resources Report provides an analysis of grant-level data for grants awarded in 2019 and 2020 to support lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) issues. This section provides an overview of the methodology used to document the complex global funding landscape for LGBTI issues today.82This report collects and analyzes data on grantmaking that specifically focuses on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex issues83 and includes two sets of grants: (1) grants awarded to organizations that primarily focus on LGBTI communities and (2) grants awarded to organizations that serve a larger audience and are directed to a project that specifically focuses on LGBTI communities.The data does not include grants to organizations or projects that are generally inclusive of LGBTI people unless they explicitly address an LGBTI issue or population. For example, a human rights organization receiving a grant to provide asylum services to marginalized refugees, open and welcoming of all refugees including LGBTI people, would not have been included in the data. If that same human rights organization received a grant to provide asylum services specifically supporting LGBTI refugees, it would have been included.In some cases, donors who track funding to multiple impacted populations have been able to identify a prorated percentage of a larger grant with demonstrated LGBTI focus. 82  This methodology was developed in partnership by Global Philanthropy Project and Funders for LGBTQ Issues in close collaboration with the Global Resources Report advisory committees across each edition of the research. A full list of the 2019–2020 committee members is included in the acknowledgements at the end of this report.83  Many grantmakers and civil society groups use alternate terms to name these populations including SOGIGESC, referring to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Gender Expression, and Sex Characteristics.DATA SOURCES QUALITY CONTROL AND CODING The Global Resources Report grant database is developed predominantly through self-reporting, with participating grantmakers directly providing data on all LGBTI-related grants. When possible, grantmakers provide information on the grantee name, mission, and location as well as grant description, type of support, year, amount awarded for each individual grant, and other details.Foundations based in the United States provide data to Funders for LGBTQ Issues, while Global Philanthropy Project collects data for foundations based outside of the United States and for all government and multilateral donors. Funders for LGBTQ Issues and Global Philanthropy Project work closely together to incorporate all relevant data into the Global Resources Report. Once received, grants are reviewed by the research team for consistency and accuracy. In order to maximize the consistency and overall quality of data, some grants are eliminated from the dataset if they fall outside the research parameters. For example, a grant would be excluded if it was awarded outside the two-year period of 2019–2020 or if it did not have an explicit LGBTI focus. Additional information is requested from the submitting funder in some cases.Once reviewed, grants are coded by the data analysis team, drawing on information provided about both the grantee and the grant description. In both quality control and coding, the overarching goal is to ensure data consistency.Direct data submissions may also be supplemented by a review of official disclosure documents, annual reports, press releases, and online grants databases. Funders for LGBTQ Issues' data collection method includes a review of U.S. tax return form 990 for foundations and nonprofit institutions. Global Philanthropy Project utilizes additional datasets from the 360Giving database of foundation funding in the United Kingdom and the Candid Foundation Maps global dataset for both LGBT and intersex funding.While both LGBTI-focused and LGBTI-inclusive grants can have a significant impact on LGBTI communities, LGBTI-focused grants are distinct in that, by definition, they work to proactively address the unique challenges, disparities, and rights abuses faced by LGBTI communities. It is also more feasible to attain a consistent and comprehensive picture of LGBTI-focused grants, while a dataset of LGBTI-inclusive grants would be difficult to map consistently and could misleadingly inflate the level of support for LGBTI communities.1392019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesMethodologyDEFINING AN LGBTI GRANTThe following types of funders are included in this report.  • Private foundations: Nongovernmental and/or nonprofit organizations or charitable trusts whose funding is typically endowed by a family or an individual donor, or through the sale of corporate assets. Private foundations do not solicit funds from the public. • Public foundations: Institutions set up to raise funds from the general public in order to award grants. Some public foundations also function as intermediary funders, receiving funds from other foundations or development agencies in order to regrant those funds to civil society organizations and grassroots groups.  • Intermediary organizations: Nongovernmental and/or civil society organizations (CSOs) operating a range of programs, including the regranting of funds received from foundations or development agencies to other (generally smaller) civil society organizations and grassroots groups.  • Corporate funders: Foundations and grantmaking programs at for-profit organizations. • Governments: Funding awarded by donor governments through a range of agencies and embassies. This report documents government funding focused on international development efforts to advance LGBTI rights and does not include governments’ domestic funding.  • Multilateral agencies: Organizations formed by multiple countries for the purpose of joint funding or other types of cooperation. • Anonymous funders: Foundations and funds seeking to maintain anonymity in their giving.84 For the purposes of this report, donor government and multilateral agencies are reported in a single category, as are public foundations and NGO intermediaries. Data from individual donors was not collected unless the funding was awarded through a philanthropic entity, such as a private foundation or a donor-advised fund housed at a public foundation.GRANT AWARDS AND DISBURSEMENTS This report provides data on the year of grant award as opposed to the year(s) of grant disbursement. This means that for multiyear commitments, the full sum of the grant is counted in the year in which it was awarded. For example, a three-year grant for $30,000 awarded in 2019 and disbursed in three annual payments of $10,000 would be documented in this report as a $30,000 grant in 2019 as opposed to $10,000 grants in 2019, 2020, and 2021. CURRENCIES All figures are reported in U.S. dollars. When data was provided in another currency, grant amounts were converted to U.S. dollars based on the conversion rate at the midpoint of the year in which the grant was awarded.8584  In this edition of the report and retroactively, anonymous funders who are known to the analysts are now coded as their known type of donor so that only those entirely anonymous are included in this category. 85  Conversion rates based on xrates.com or xe.com when currencies were not available through xrates.com. Conversion dates were June 30, 2019, and June 30, 2020.86  Learn more about intermediary grantmaking models: The Road to Successful Partnerships: How Governments in the Global North Can Effectively Partner With Intermediary Organizations to Support LGBTI communities in the Global South and East. (2016). Global Philanthropy Project. https://globalphilanthropyproject.org/2016/07/03/the-road-to-successful-partnerships/How Is Double-Counting Avoided?This is one of the most common questions about the data in this report, reflecting awareness of the complexity and challenges of documenting the philanthropic ecosystem.  Global LGBTI funding streams encompass a complex network of intermediary “regranting” organizations that receive funds from donor governments and multilateral agencies and/or private foundations (these original funders are often referred to as the “back-donor”) and are entrusted to use those resources to make smaller grants to grassroots organizations.86This report tracks funds awarded for the purposes of regranting and eliminates double-counting where appropriate. Specifically, when there is data for both (1) a grant awarded to an intermediary for regranting and (2) the grants ultimately awarded by the intermediary, then only the latter set of grants is included in most tabulations and charts. There are a few exceptions, which are identified throughout the report when they occur. In order to accurately document the overall level of LGBTI funding provided by each grantmaker, regardless of whether those funds are provided in the form of direct grants or via an intermediary, all regranting funds are included in (1) top funder lists, (2) type of donor lists, and (3) the Appendix II list of LGBTI grantmakers by name.Original funderDirect fundingRegrantingIntermediaryfunderGrantee organizationsFocus workFunding Flow Models140 1412019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesMethodologyMethodologyDOCUMENTING THE MULTIPLICITIES OF LGBTI POPULATIONSGRANTEE GEOGRAPHIC FOCUSREGIONS AND SUB-REGIONSThe grantees documented in this report are often working at the forefront of emerging strategies and language to describe the nuance and complexities of LGBTI identities, including the possibilities for solidarity and mutual efforts between and within LGBTI movements and other populations. The methodology of this report requires a less intersectional method of assigning LGBTI population focus. Similar to our method of documenting LGBTI-focused funding as opposed to funding that is LGBTI-inclusive, this report aims to document funding that is truly focused on LGBTI “subpopulations” based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics. For this reason, this report makes every effort to code grants to only one “subpopulation” within the LGBTI acronym, for example, coding grants as intersex funding when they are focused exclusively on intersex communities, rather than attributing intersex funding to all groups that use the acronym LGBTI. For grants focused on multiple sexual orientation subpopulations, the “general LGBQ” code is often used. Throughout this report, funding is documented by geographic focus, for instance, funding focused on the Global South and East, the region of Sub-Saharan Africa, the sub-region of East Africa, or on specific countries. Whenever funding focus is mentioned, this report indicates where the work is happening. This may be different from the location of the grantee organization, especially common in the cases of regional or international organizations that may have programs based in a different location than their central office, and in relation to cross-border cooperation between civil society organizations.In the case of grants identifying populations explicitly intersecting across sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics—such as “LBT women” or “trans and intersex”—a grant may be coded to a primary group or in some cases may be coded to multiple subpopulations based on the grant and organization descriptions. In the case of especially large grants, the coding may be split into multiple subpopulations.Distinct demographic information within the LGBTI community is separately coded, including age group, socioeconomic group, indigenous or ethnic minority, and other interconnected populations.87This report includes funding data for a set of “spotlight” subpopulation groups within the LGBTI community: Children and Youth; Immigrants, Refugees, and Asylum Seekers; People of Faith; People Living with HIV or AIDS (PLWHA); and Sex Workers.The grouping of countries into regions and sub-regions was developed based on a review of several similar taxonomies, including that of the United Nations and other international bodies, as well as existing philanthropic research such as that of the Foundation Center (now Candid) and the Human Rights Funders Network.87  More detailed taxonomy information can be found in Appendix III.142 1432019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesMethodologyMethodologyTYPE OF SUPPORT STRATEGIES AND ISSUESCONFIDENTIALITYThis report identifies the “type of support” of each grant, with options including general operating, program, capacity building, regranting, emergency funds, capital support, matching funds, prizes/awards, scholarships, fellowships, seed funding, and sponsorships.Each funding institution may use slightly different names and nuanced definitions for the types of support they offer. For instance, what this report refers to as general operating funds may be called “core support,” while the category of program funding may be called “project funding.”When types of support were not self-reported by grantmakers, they were coded based on the Global Resources Report taxonomy, drawing on information provided in the grant description.Strategies and sub-strategies, as well as issues and sub-issues, were identified based on the grant descriptions. Strategies included eight categories and 22 subcategories while Issues were divided into eight categories with 36 subcategories.88 These categories draw from those developed over a decade by Funders for LGBTQ Issues for U.S. domestic funding in their annual tracking report, with additional categories included over time where new funding patterns are noted.Due to numerous hostile and dangerous environments for LGBTI individuals and organizing around LGBTI issues, this report includes grantees and locations that have been anonymized or where anonymity has been requested by the reporting funders to ensure the confidentiality of grantees.In some cases, funders have also requested to remain anonymous as well, due to the sensitivity of their funding.88  More detailed taxonomy information can be found in Appendix III.New and Updated CategoriesThis edition of the report includes a number of new and updated Issue and Sub-Issue categories aimed at tracking emerging trends in LGBTI funding. •  Humanitarian Response was added as a new issue-level item, with a corresponding sub-issue to enable tracking LGBTI funding related to COVID89 and other emergent crises.•  A sub-issue was added for Responding to Anti-Gender Ideology to enable tracking this philanthropic response.90•  Two sub-issues related to sexual and reproductive health were combined, now represented by Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights as a sub-issue of Human Rights.89  For more information, visit https://globalphilanthropyproject.org/covid19/90  For more information, visit https://globalphilanthropyproject.org/resistingagi/144 1452019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesMethodologyMethodologyAPPENDIX I Funding by Country of FocusThis appendix shows the amount of funding that was designated for LGBTI issues by country of focus over the two-year period of 2019–2020. NOTE: This table excludes known regranting and excludes funding to multiple countries. This table indicates funding focused on each country, indicating where the work is happening. This may be different from the location of the grantee organization, especially in the case of regional or international organizations that may have programs based in a different location than their central office.Country Name Total Funds Afghanistan $5,000Albania $587,284Algeria $107,165Angola $61,140Antigua and Barbuda $17,230Argentina $931,438Armenia $472,255Australia $556,722Austria $292,190Azerbaijan $97,539Bahamas $30,410Bahrain $9,000Bangladesh $1,131,560Barbados $55,367Belarus $110,122Belgium $149,837Belize $552,478Benin $455,158Bhutan $57,866Bolivia $2,539,668Bosnia and Herzegovina $840,280Botswana $1,041,056Brazil $2,125,278Bulgaria $778,297Burkina Faso $727,079Burundi $303,409Cambodia $211,081Cameroon $1,838,755Country Name Total Funds Canada $729,681Chile $1,006,556China $1,917,273Colombia $3,627,386Costa Rica $1,365,947Croatia $498,879Cuba $32,823Cyprus $15,960Czech Republic $430,113Democratic Republic of the Congo $164,687Denmark $20,000Dominican Republic $312,543Ecuador $901,263Egypt $1,015,042El Salvador $980,017Equatorial Guinea $12,500Estonia $104,395Eswatini $221,086Ethiopia $29,869Fiji $375,338Finland $6,568France $468,684Gambia $5,430Georgia $602,813Germany $1,214,921Ghana $438,401Greece $78,406Grenada $13,983Guatemala $4,612,064Guyana $510,326Haiti $336,183Honduras $927,130Hungary $294,822Iceland $22,000India $4,417,304Indonesia $1,439,629Iran $7,810Iraq $331,442Ireland $734,420Israel $277,860Italy $912,521Ivory Coast $163,327Jamaica $1,656,906Japan $459,615Jordan $31,031Kazakhstan $3,058,027Kenya $8,859,990Kiribati $43,209Kosovo $266,026Kyrgyzstan $585,480Country Name Total Funds Laos $77,573Latvia $70,175Lebanon $1,673,082Lesotho $154,250Liberia $533,077Lithuania $471,936Madagascar $24,545Malawi $948,796Malaysia $191,045Mali $29,248Malta $45,162Mauritania $16,716Mauritius $385,304Mexico $3,723,477Moldova $102,132Mongolia $109,500Montenegro $309,886Morocco $475,583Mozambique $197,478Myanmar $1,481,646Namibia $456,714Nepal $374,635Netherlands $501,155New Zealand $1,624,263Nicaragua $1,689,075Nigeria $3,240,831North Macedonia $198,637Norway $1,828Pakistan $1,008,706Palestinian Territories $225,000Panama $257,274Papua New Guinea $12,750Paraguay $353,886Peru $884,877Philippines $710,554Poland $1,450,977Portugal $62,254Republic of the Congo $14,822Romania $2,511,648Russia $3,945,938Rwanda $492,609Saint Kitts and Nevis $49,542Saint Lucia $263,251Saudi Arabia $8,000Senegal $246,819Serbia $790,520Sierra Leone $28,798Singapore $179,529Slovakia $143,856Slovenia $196,768146 1472019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities2019-2020 Global Resources Report – Government and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesAppendix I: Funding by Country of FocusCountry Name Total Funds South Africa $4,808,346South Korea $128,154South Sudan $15,000Spain $306,994Sri Lanka $657,171St. Vincent & Grenadines $13,921Sudan $162,472Suriname $31,774Sweden $18,421Switzerland $302,223Syria $11,235Taiwan $498,800Tajikistan $127,302Tanzania $1,293,402Thailand $1,363,931Timor-Leste $43,403Togo $847,816Tonga $66,118Trinidad and Tobago $309,815Tunisia $1,051,611Turkey $2,485,182Uganda $6,228,217Ukraine $4,220,084United Kingdom $25,846,248Uruguay $64,210USA $338,508,064Uzbekistan $74,019Vanuatu $31,813Venezuela $101,734Vietnam $2,044,981Yemen $10,700Zambia $718,383Zimbabwe $750,793APPENDIX II2019–2020 List of LGBTI GrantmakersThis appendix lists the 213 funders included in this report and the amount of funding provided for LGBTI issues in 2019–2020, excluding funding focused on the United States.
