Our hypothesizedmoderated moderation model argues that employee exhaustion and affective commitment suffer less from work–self conflict, discrimination,and nontransparent work procedures when employees feel included in diverse perceived environments. A total of 1187 employees of a universityof technology completed electronical surveys. The results indicated that the negative relationships between stressful work experiences andorganizational commitment were weaker if employees felt more included in perceived diverse work environments. Diversity and inclusion did notshape the relationships between stressful work experiences and employee exhaustion. The study emphasizes the buffering role of inclusion indiversifying organizations and offers a better understanding of how diversity and inclusion interact with other work aspects.Keywords: perceived diversity, inclusion, employee exhaustion, affective commitmentThe science, technology, engineering, and mathematics(STEM) sector remains exclusive to specific employeegroups (e.g., females; Catalyst, 2019). Based on an ethicalargument for inclusive recruitment and to ensure highquality of products and services, STEM organizations aim toincrease workforce diversity by recruiting and maintainingemployees who continue to be underrepresented in thissector. Workforce diversity refers to the differences be-tween employees regarding demographic and functionalcharacteristics (Van Knippenberg & Schippers, 2007). Theimpact of the diversification on the opportunity to maintainhealthy and committed employees has received limitedscholarly attention (Jaiswal & Dyaram, 2019). Whileworkforce diversity is thought to guarantee creativity andholistic solutions because a variety of perspectives is con-sidered during the development process, diversity mightalso put an extra burden on employees, especially if em-ployees are not able to process the differences of colleagueswithin work groups (Van Knippenberg et al., 2004). Tominimize the negative and maximize the positive conse-quences of diversity, scholars point toward creating inclu-sive workplaces. An inclusive workplace is one in whichemployees’ needs to belong and to be authentic are si-multaneously satisfied (Jansen et al., 2014). Meta-analyticevidence indicates that experienced inclusion improvesemployees’ well-being and performance (Mor Barak et al.,2016). Encouraged by these findings, researchers argue thatsolely examining the impact of workforce diversity onemployee outcomes is insufficient. Rather, it is valuable totreat diversity as a context variable that interacts with otherwork conditions and jointly influences workers’ health andwork attitude (Jaiswal & Dyaram, 2019).Research showed that stressful work experiences harmemployee exhaustion and affective commitment (e.g.,Podsakoff et al., 2007). In this regard, hindrance stressorspotentially restrict the work achievement of employeesbecause they display constraints that evoke stress(Cavanaugh et al., 2000). These stressors, thus, threatenthe retention of a diverse workforce in STEM organiza-tions. Studies that provide insight into the impact ofhindrance stressors and other relevant aspects that arerelated to further impairments of health and well-being donot consider the organizational context of rising diversityin STEM organizations (Catalyst, 2019). Therefore, thispaper aims to create amore comprehensive understandingof the consequences of work characteristics, diversity, andinclusion for STEM organizations. We follow the call ofprevious research (e.g., Jaiswal & Dyaram, 2019) to ex-amine the interactive relations between these aspects andemployee outcomes.Journal of Personnel Psychology (2023), 22(2), 66–75https://doi.org/10.1027/1866-5888/a000311© 2022 Hogrefe PublishingThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.The contributions of this study are threefold. First, weintent to connect the diversity and inclusion literature withthe occupational health research by linking insights of theinclusion framework (Shore et al., 2011) and the challengestressor and hindrance stressor framework (e.g., LePineet al., 2005). We provide empirical insight into howfeelings of inclusion in more diverse work environmentsshape the extent to which stressful work experiences relateto employee outcomes. Specifically, we propose that ex-perienced inclusion can weaken the harmful relationshipof hindrance stressors with employee exhaustion and af-fective commitment in perceived diverse workplaces.Second, we follow the call to examine the health and af-fective consequences of diversity (Jaiswal & Dyaram,2019) with the aim to provide STEM organizations withinsight into how to increase and maintain their diversifiedworkforce. In this regard, we avoid examining the impactof diversity on employee well-being in isolation but presentinteractive relationships of hindrance stressors, perceiveddiversity, and the degree to which employees feel includedat work. Finally, as inclusion enables teams to benefit fromtheir group diversity (Mor Barak et al., 2016), we aim tounderscore that inclusion displays an important mecha-nism to prevent negative consequences for employees indiverse environments. In this way, our study extends theimplications for diversity and inclusion management inSTEM environments.Theoretical BackgroundThe Impairment of Health and Well-Being ofSTEM EmployeesSTEM organizations desire to expand and maintain theirdiversified workforce. In this regard, they need to sustainemployees’ occupational health and commitment toward theorganization. Stress represents a factor of the work envi-ronment that highly influences these employee outcomes(Boswell et al., 2004). The literature argues that based onindividual perceptions, stressors are either potentially gainfulor potentially threatening for personal achievements andwork-related accomplishments (Cavanaugh et al., 2000). Onthe one hand, challenge stressors (e.g., job complexity orworkload) that are associated with an opportunity for per-sonal growth potentially lead to goal achievement andstimulate positive emotions (LePine et al., 2005). On theother hand, stressors that are evaluated as work conditionsthat interfere with employees’ work success and potentiallylead to undesirable strain are defined as hindrance stressors(Cavanaugh et al., 2000). Examples of hindrance stressorsare situational constraints, organizational politics, resourceinadequacies, and role conflicts (Crawford et al., 2010).Hindrance stressors diminish employee loyalty and increasepsychological strain (e.g., Boswell et al., 2004). As we intentto offer insight to organizations on how to increase andmaintain their diversified workforce, this study focuses onhindrance stressors rather than challenge stressors. Hin-drance stressors might be especially threatening for em-ployees in diverse environments if the employee does notexperience inclusion. The following section zooms in onwork–self conflict, discrimination, and nontransparent workprocedures; discusses their relevance in the context of di-versifying STEM environments; and to what extent these arerelated to affective commitment and employee exhaustion.Furthermore, this study examines the impairment process ofemployee outcomes at different levels of inclusion experi-ences when increased workforce diversity is perceived.Stressful Work Experiences in DiversifyingScientific Work EnvironmentsA potential stressful work condition prevailing in thecontext of STEM is the interference of work and private lifeas it has been found that conflicts between these twodomains immensely impact work stress and dissatisfactionof university staff (Catano et al., 2010). Work–self conflictsare defined as conflicts that occur if responsibilities in thework domain restrict one’s personal activities and interests(Demerouti et al., 2013). The concept is not restricted tothe work versus family domain and is therefore a moreinclusive concept to investigate the spillover of work intononwork areas including hobbies. Work–self conflictrepresents a stressful work experience as employees whoexperience a high work–self conflict have difficulties tomanage the interface between their work domain and theirprivate domain and therefore have depleted energy due toa loss of resources (Demerouti et al., 2013). Specifically,Demerouti et al. (2016) showed that due to a scarcity ofindividual resources (e.g., time and energy), employeeswho experienced a conflict between their work and privatedomain encountered more stress and less work accom-plishments. The relation between work–self conflict andemployee outcomes can be explained by self-regulationtheories. Self-regulation displays a process of comparingone’s current and ideal situation. If individuals perceivediscrepancies, they undertake behavioral and cognitiveactions to fix the inconsistency (Carver & Scheier, 1981).Employees that need to deal with negative aspects at workwill experience more energy depletion and subsequentlymore stress and dissatisfaction. Furthermore, research hasshown that work–self conflict undermines individuals’personal resources (e.g., self-efficacy), which led to de-creased task performance (Demerouti et al., 2016).Journal of Personnel Psychology (2023), 22(2), 66–75© 2022 Hogrefe PublishingJ. Behnke et al., Diversity and Inclusion in a STEM Organization 67This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.Additionally, employees who frequently have difficulties toengage in private life activities due to work concernsdevelop negative attitudes toward their work and feel thusless satisfied and committed to their organization overtime (Huang et al., 2007). Work–self conflict might thusrepresent a stressor that interferes with one’s work andprevents work success. The lack of resources and thenegative emotions about the conflict might lead to lesscommitment to their organization and more emotionalexhaustion over time (Demerouti et al., 2013).Furthermore, to appropriately investigate the impact ofperceived diversity and experienced inclusion on the rela-tionship between hindrance stressors and employee out-comes, this study focuses on stressors that are relevant forthe diversity and inclusion context in STEM organizations.In this regard, scholars stated that discrimination and lesstransparent work procedures are dominant stressors oforganizations that aim to diversify their workforce but wherethe work context remains to be dominantly shaped by themajority employee group (Jansen et al., 2015). First, ac-cording to the social categorization perspective, the cir-cumstance that employees differ on characteristics can leadto the formation of subgroups, whereby individuals comparethemselves to others at work and form cognitive in- and out-groups (Tajfel & Turner, 1986). As a result, discriminationwill be enabled through the reinforcement of borders be-tween these subgroups (Mummendey & Wenzel, 1999).Discrimination refers to the belief that one is treated lessfavorably because one belongs to a specific social group(Sanchez & Brock, 1996). Discrimination causes physicaland mental strain (Schmitt et al., 2014). Additionally, it wasfound to be negatively related to employee behavior andcommitment (Jones et al., 2016). Thus, when employeesexperience discrimination, it potentially hinders their work-related accomplishments and stimulates a stress processthat can lead to exhaustion and decreased organizationalcommitment. Second, work procedures of diversifying or-ganizations are developed and based on the needs of ma-jority employees (Jansen et al., 2015). Due to increasingdifferences between employees, work procedures oftenappear to be less clear at large. In this regard, nontransparentwork procedures represent the extent to which employeesperceive the understandability of human resource-relatedprocedures (e.g. recruitment or performance appraisalprocedures) as not consistent (Colquitt, 2001). Non-transparent work procedures represent ambiguity regardingorganizational practices and regulations, which constrainsemployees’ personal achievement and produces stress foremployees. Indeed, research identified nontransparentworkprocedures as a form of organizational demand that inducesfeelings of exclusion and has detrimental consequences foremployees’ health and performance (Daya, 2014).Perceived Diversity and Its Interplay WithStressful Work ExperiencesStressors do not necessarily impact individuals nega-tively (Podsakoff et al., 2007). The work environment,and especially how employees appraise stressful situa-tions at work, was found to play an important role(Cavanaugh et al., 2000). Therefore, employees’ per-ceptions of their environment and how these shape theimpairment process needs to be taken into account. Apredominant phenomenon in STEM organizations is theincreasing workforce diversity from which the institu-tions desire to generate a competitive advantage(Catalyst, 2019). The perception of workforce diversityreflects the degree to which individuals are aware thatothers differ along any salient dimension (Shemla et al.,2016). This study focuses on perceived workforce di-versity rather than objective diversity as we are inter-ested in the impact of the work context, which most likelyvaries across individuals. While we acknowledge thedifference between subjective and objective workforcediversity, diversity perceptions were found to be anadequate approximation of objective diversity becausepeople react based on perceptions of reality than realityper se (Shemla et al., 2016). Studies confirmed thatperceived diversity mediates the effects of actual di-versity and thus may explain the impact of workforcediversity more proximal than actual diversity (Harrison& Klein, 2007).Studies have found dominantly negative consequencesof perceived diversity (Shemla et al., 2016). The socialcategorization theory (Van Knippenberg & Schippers,2007) states that diversity might display an additionalemotional and cognitive demanding aspect. The em-ployees need to deal with higher cognitive effort becauseof the differences among team members (e.g., culturaldifferences). Moreover, categorization might reinforceborders between team members that are different andthus lead to increased discrimination and intergroupconflicts (Van Knippenberg et al., 2004). Nevertheless,researchers have concluded that the effects of diversityshould not be investigated in isolation (Jaiswal &Dyaram, 2019). Employees need to be enabled to pro-cess different information to benefit from workforcediversity (Van Knippenberg et al., 2004). In this regard,inclusion impacts the relations between workplace di-versity and employee outcomes (Mor Barak et al., 2016).To derive at more concise conclusions regarding the rolethat diversity plays on the impairment process of healthand well-being, it is thus of great importance to inves-tigate the joint impact of perceived diversity and expe-rienced inclusion.Journal of Personnel Psychology (2023), 22(2), 66–75 © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing68 J. Behnke et al., Diversity and Inclusion in a STEM OrganizationThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.Experienced Inclusion as an Approach toBenefit From Workforce DiversityThe experience of inclusion has been identified as an ef-fective approach to benefit from diversity among employees,while reducing the detriments (Mor Barak et al., 2016).People that experience inclusion feel that they belong to asocial unit while at the same time they are valued for theirauthenticity (Jansen et al., 2014). Inclusive environmentswere found to provide more psychological safety to em-ployees to be themselves and share different knowledge(Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006). In line with the inclusionframework (Shore et al., 2011), researchers state that in di-verse work environments, in which employees experienceinclusion, social categorization will less likely take place,reducing the cognitive load and allowing employees toprocess different information (Mor Barak et al., 2016).Building on previous inclusion research (e.g., Shore et al.,2018), the lack of inclusion resembles an employee to feelexcluded, which is defined by the inclusion framework as thesituation in which employees are not treated as organiza-tional insiders with unique value in their work groups, whilethere are other employees who are considered insiders(Shore et al., 2011). Exclusion is detrimental for employeeexhaustion because it represents an additional demand thatemployees are faced with. In this regard, exclusionstrengthens the creation of social groups based on individualcharacteristics, which results in deterioration of cooperativeprocesses between colleagues and adds additional strain foremployees (Van Knippenberg et al., 2004). As a result, thelack of inclusion denies opportunities for employees to dealwith negative aspects of diversified groups and might thusadd an additional source for energy loss (Schmitt et al., 2014).Consequently, employees might experience more strain andthus feel additionally exhausted at work. This might be es-pecially true in work environments that are perceived asmore diverse because the feeling of authenticity and be-longingness is especially important the more an employeeperceives differences among colleagues (Jansen et al., 2014).We therefore hypothesize:Hypothesis 1: The positive relationship betweenstressful work experiences and employee exhaustionis moderated by perceptions of diversity and expe-rienced inclusion, such that, the relationships be-tween (a) work–self conflict, (b) discrimination, and(c) nontransparent work procedures and employeeexhaustion become stronger if an employee perceiveshigher workforce diversity and lower inclusion com-pared to higher inclusion.In addition, as feelings of inclusion prevent additionaldemands stemming from perceived diversity, feelingincluded might also boost employees’ attitude towardtheir organization and therefore prevent detrimentalimpact of a stressful work environment. Feelings ofexclusion potentially add negative associations withone’s workplace and thus might strengthen the negativerelations between stressful work experiences and af-fective commitment (Jones et al., 2016). Additionally, theweak relationships with others at work can result innegative feelings regarding one’s work (Shore et al.,2011). Negative work experiences add an additionalburden that diminishes employees’ emotional connec-tion to their organization drastically (Bakker et al.,2005). Thus, we assume that if employees perceivehigher workforce diversity, feelings of inclusion are es-sential to overcome exclusion and differentiation. Wetherefore hypothesize:Hypothesis 2: The negative relationship betweenstressful work experiences and employee affectivecommitment is moderated by perceptions of diversityand experienced inclusion, such that relationships be-tween (a) work–self conflict, (b) discrimination, and (c)nontransparent work procedures and affective com-mitment become stronger if an employee perceiveshigher diversity and lower inclusion compared to higherinclusion.The hypothesized model is outlined in Figure 1.MethodsParticipants and ProcedureThe sample comprised 1,918 employees of a technicaluniversity located in the Netherlands (response rate:30.37%). Employees anonymously filled in an onlinequestionnaire. We deleted responses of 731 participantsbecause they provided less than 10% of the requestedFigure 1.

Participantsrepresented all scientific departments (52.3% of thesample is scientific staff) and crucial service groups of thetechnical university (47.7% of the sample is nonscientificstaff [representation in the organization: 68.2% scientificstaff vs. 31.8% nonscientific staff ]). Nonscientific staffcomprises technical departments (e.g., “Equipment &Prototype Center” or “Information Management Ser-vices”) and nontechnical departments (e.g., “HumanResources” or “Education and Student Affairs”). Most ofthe participants identified as male (54%). We recorded41% female participants, and 5% defined differently or didnot enclose their gender identification (representation inthe organization: 65.2% male vs. 34.8% female em-ployees). Moreover, about two-third reported to be Dutchand about one-third were internationals (N = 191 Europeanbesides Dutch, N = 83 Asian, N = 39 from other conti-nents). Looking at a cross-tabulation we can report 39% ofthe participants to be majority employees (male andDutch), while the rest of participants hold a characteristicof a minority employee group at the STEM university (33%female and Dutch, 10% female and international, 17%male and international, and 1% other gender identificationand Dutch or international). Furthermore, approximatelyone-third (N = 376) of the participants was between 18 and33 years old, one-third (N = 361) was between 34 and 49years old, and one-third (N = 406) was older than 50 years.Respondents additionally reported a variety of work-related characteristics. A relatively big group (N = 448)stated to work less than three years at the university.Additionally, 428 employees reported a work tenure of4–15 years, and 310 employees reported to work for over 16years at the university. Finally, 17% of the respondents hada managerial position within the university.MeasuresStressful Work ExperiencesWe measured work–self conflict (Demerouti et al., 2016)with four items (α = .89) on a 5-point Likert scale anddiscrimination (Mena et al., 1987) with three items (α = .83)on a 4-point Likert scale. Example items of these twoscales are as follows: “How often does it happen that youcannot fully enjoy your personal activities because youworry about your work?” and “At work, I sometimes feelthat my personal background is a limitation.” Transpar-ency of work procedures was measured by three self-developed statements (“I know how decisions are madeat my organization”, “I know how resources are allocatedat my organization”, and “Information about procedures isprovided to all employees”), where high scores representless transparent work procedures (reverse coding). An-swers ranged from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree(α = .75).Perceptions of Workplace DiversityFollowing Van Dick et al. (2008), respondents indicatedsubjective diversity for six dimensions (i.e., age, gender,ethnic background, educational background, personalvalues, work expertise). Answers ranged from (1) not di-verse to (5) very diverse. The calculated mean score rep-resents the level of perceived diversity. Our internalconsistency (α = .70) was slightly lower compared to otherstudies (Van Dick et al., 2008: α = .75).Experienced InclusionFeelings of belongingness and authenticity were measuredwith six items (example item “This work group treats meas an insider”) of Jansen et al.’s (2014) Perceived GroupInclusion Scale (α = .94). Answers ranged from (1) never to(5) always.Employee OutcomesWeused four items from theOldenburg Burnout Inventory(Demerouti & Bakker, 2008) to measure employee ex-haustion (α = .78). Answers ranged from (1) totally disagreeto (4) totally agree (example item: “During my work I feelmore often emotionally exhausted”). Affective commitmentwas assessed by three items (α = .60) from Allen andMeyer (1990). Answer possibilities ranged from (1) totallydisagree to (7) totally agree (example item: “I would be veryhappy to spend the rest of my career with thisorganization”).Control VariablesResearch showed that majority and minority employeesperceive their work environment differently (Jansenet al., 2015). We, therefore, controlled for group mem-bership (0 =minority employee [i.e., being female and/orinternational]; 1 = majority employee). Additionally, wecontrolled for the type of personnel in our analyses toaccount for any impact due to different work conditions,tasks, or backgrounds (0 = scientific staff; 1 = nonscien-tific staff).Analysis StrategyDescriptive statistics and correlations among the studyvariables are displayed in Table 1. The three-way inter-action hypotheses were tested using moderated modera-tion analysis (PROCESS version 3.3 by Hayes, 2018). Totest the hypotheses, nonlinear bootstrapping was appliedto estimate conditional effects (variables that defineJournal of Personnel Psychology (2023), 22(2), 66–75 © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing70 J.

The results are displayed inTable 2. To provide more detailed information regardingadditional explained variance by added interaction terms,we also conducted hierarchical regression analyses. Var-iables were standardized before the interaction terms werebuilt (details can be found in Tables S1, S2, and S3 in theElectronic Supplementary Material [ESM] 1).ResultsWe conducted Harman’s single factor test to check for acommon method bias. The results of an unrotated ex-ploratory factor analysis showed that the factor accountedfor 24% of variance of the items in the sample, which isbelow the critical value of 50% (Podsakoff et al., 2003).Next, we performed a confirmatory factor analysis thatTable 1.

Additionally, the seven-factor model showed an adequate fit (χ2[406] = 14,089.24;standardized root mean square residual = 0.05; root meansquare error of approximation = .92), and all relationshipsbetween factor and items were significant, suggesting anappropriate model (Hu & Bentler, 1999). We thus assumethat our results were not substantially impacted by com-mon method variance.To test Hypothesis 1, we examined the three-way inter-actions of stressful work experiences, perceived diversity,and experienced inclusion on employee exhaustion. First, theresults showed that the two-way interaction betweenwork–self conflict and inclusion was significantly related toemployee exhaustion (Table 3: B = .03, p < .01). Additionally,the results revealed that the three-way interaction was sig-nificant for (a) work–self conflict (Table 3: B =\u0001.03, p < .05),but not for (b) discrimination (Table 4: B =\u0001.01, p = .25) and(c) nontransparentwork procedures (Table 5:B = .01, p= .34).Regarding the significant three-way interaction, we con-ducted a simple slope test to compare the two slopes of highperceived diversity and either low or high experienced in-clusion. We focus on only two of the four slopes as we areinterested in the role of experienced inclusion in diverseperceived work environments, rather than in work groupswith low diversity. Feeling belongingness and valueduniqueness may play a different role when employees rep-resent the same personal characteristics (i.e., low diversity).The slope test indicated that both slopes were significantlypositive (Table 2): Slope 1: +1SD diversity/+1SD inclusion[effect = .35, SE = 0.03, 95% CI = .30; .41]; Slope 2 (+1SDdiversity/\u00011SD inclusion) [effect = .34, SE = 0.03, 95%CI = .28; .39]. The slope difference test showed, against ourprediction, that the relationship between work–self conflictand employee exhaustion did not differ significantly foremployees who experiences higher versus lower inclusion inmore diverse environments (ΔB = \u0001.02, p = .62). The sig-nificant three-way interaction stemmed from the employeegroup that perceived lower diversity and higher inclusion,which showed a significant stronger positive relationshipcompared to the other groups (see Figure 2). Thus, in workenvironments that employees perceive as less diverse and inwhich they do feel included, the positive relationship ofwork–self conflict and employee exhaustion was the stron-gest for employees. We therefore reject Hypothesis 1.To test Hypothesis 2, we examined the three-way in-teractions of stressful work experiences, perceived diversity,and experienced inclusion on affective commitment. Nosignificant two-way interactions were identified betweenstressful work experiences and either perceived diversity orexperienced inclusion. The interaction of perceived diver-sity and experienced inclusion was, however, positivelyrelated to affective commitment (B = .07, p < .05), asdisplayed in Table 5. The three-way interaction was notsignificant for (b) discrimination (Table 4: B = .02, p = .35)but showed significance for (a) work–self conflict (Table 4:B = .05, p < .05) and (c) nontransparent work procedures(Table 5: B = .07, p < .01). The relationship between work–selfconflict and affective commitment (see Figure 3) appearedonly significantly negative for employees perceiving less in-clusion instead of more inclusion, in more diverse perceivedenvironments (Table 2): Slope 1: +1SD diversity/+1SD inclu-sion [effect = \u0001.05, SE = 0.07, 95% CI = \u0001.18; .09]; Slope 2(+1SD diversity/\u00011SD inclusion) [effect = \u0001.15, SE = 0.07,95% CI = \u000128; \u0001.02].

The relationship between non-transparent work procedures and affective commitment ap-peared stronger negative for employees perceiving lessinclusion, compared to more inclusion, in more diverse per-ceived environments (Slope 1: +1SD diversity/+1SD inclusion[effect =\u0001.38, SE =0.08, 95%CI =\u0001.54;\u0001.22]; Slope 2 (+1SDdiversity/\u00011SD inclusion) [effect = \u0001.19, SE = 0.07, 95%CI = \u000131; \u0001.05]. Hypothesis 2 was partially supported. Thestressful work experiences (i.e., self-work conflict and non-transparent procedures) had a weaker negative relationship toemployees’ affective commitment if employees experiencedmore inclusion in amorediverse perceivedwork environment.DiscussionThis study examined in a STEM organization whetherstressful work experiences (i.e., work–self conflict, dis-crimination, and nontransparent work procedures) aremore detrimental for employee health and affectivecommitment when employees feel less compared tomore inclusion in diverse perceived work environments.The results point toward a beneficial role of inclusionbut also show that the interaction between stressfulwork experiences, perceived diversity, and inclusionand their joint impact on employee exhaustion and af-fective commitment appears very complex and requiresmore detailed attention.Theoretical ImplicationsOur research is one of the first attempts that examines thejoint relationship of stressful work experiences, workforcediversity, and inclusion experiences with emotional ex-haustion and effective commitment. In this regard, wecontribute to diversity and inclusion research as well as tooccupational health research by offering valuable insight intohow diversity and inclusion shape the impairment process ofemployee health and well-being. The findings suggest thatinclusion in diverse workplacesmight create an environmentthat potentially buffers detrimental effects of stressful ex-periences on affective commitment. For two out of the threetested work aspects (i.e., work–self conflict and non-transparent work procedures), we found that these stressorshad weaker negative relations with employees’ affectivecommitment when employees experienced more inclusion.This result is in line with the inclusion framework and showsthat inclusion prevents employees frompotential detrimentalconsequences of exclusion and differentiation (Shore et al.,2011). Moreover, the results follow the line of thinking ofoccupational health research, which points out thatpotentially less resourceful environments hamper em-ployees’ ability to deal with constraining job aspects (Bakkeret al., 2005). Nevertheless, the negative relation of experi-enced discrimination and affective commitment was notdependent on employees’ feeling of inclusion in a morediverse perceived work environment. We assume that ex-periences of discrimination might be a very extreme andunique stressor that is always related to negative feelingstoward one’s workplace (Shore et al., 2018). Next, con-cerning employee exhaustion, the level of experienced in-clusion in more diverse environments did not change therelationship between stressful experiences and this healthoutcome. All work aspects were positively associated withemployee exhaustion across different level of inclusion ex-periences. In line with the research of Crawford et al. (2010),we conclude that the impairment process of employee ex-haustion is stable across the addressed environmental dif-ferences. Overall, this study contributes to the literature ondiversity and inclusion by examining their relationship toemployee health and affective commitment (Jaiswal &Dyaram, 2019). Our results show that the level of com-mitment of employees, but not employees health, is de-pendent upon one’s experience of inclusion in a diverse workenvironment. We therefore confirm previous conceptualwork that reasons that inclusion displays an importantmechanism to prevent negative affective consequences foremployees in diverse environments (Shore et al., 2018).Management ImplicationsOur study has important implications for STEM universitiesthat strive for an increased workforce diversity. The findingssuggest that employees’ emotional attachment toward theirorganization potentially suffers less from stressful workexperiences if they feel more inclusion. Thus, besides in-creasing the numerical representation of minority charac-teristics (e.g., bring in more female or internationalemployees), STEM universities need to enhance the inclu-sion experience of employees to maintain a diverse work-force. Thus, employees’ feelings of belongingness as well astheir feelings of being an authentic member of the work-place need to be facilitated (Shore et al., 2018). Opportu-nities are threefold: creating an inclusive climate, developingleaders to utilize an inclusive leadership style, and providinginclusive practices (Shore et al., 2011). Organizations need tocreate organizational systems that guarantee fairness andvalue differences of employees. Furthermore, leaders fa-cilitate inclusion by engaging in inclusive behaviors (e.g.,invite and appreciate unique contributions; Nembhard &Edmondson, 2006). Finally, inclusive practices (e.g., in-volvement in decision-making) enhance cohesivenessfeelings of team members (Shore et al., 2018).Journal of Personnel Psychology (2023), 22(2), 66–75© 2022 Hogrefe PublishingJ.

Although theperformed tests showed that the common method bias isnot a concern for this study, we realize that our data do notallow conclusions regarding variable causality. Our studyprovides more of an explanatory foundation for furtherstudies. A second limitation is the restricted generalizabilityof our results as the present study is based on employeesworking in one single STEM university. Nevertheless, ourstudy included both scientific and nonscientific staff; thus,our sample entails heterogeneity of job positions and tasks.Future research can extend our attempts by including other-rated individual outcomes and using a time series approach.Additionally, our results showed that the potential bufferingrole of inclusion in diverse environments on the impairmentprocess is limited. Future studies might consider othercontext variables (e.g., leadership or coworker behavior)that might buffer the detrimental impact of stressful workexperiences on employee well-being.In conclusion, the present study demonstrated thatemployees potentially benefit from feeling included indiverse work environments. Specifically, we showed thatin perceived diverse environments stressful work experi-ences were less detrimental for employees’ affectivecommitment when employees experienced more inclu-sion. Additionally, the results revealed that differentperceptions of one’s work environment in terms of per-ceived diversity and experienced inclusion did not changethe harmful health impairment process, which providesvaluable insights for practice and further research.Electronic Supplementary MaterialThe electronic supplementary material is available withthe online version of the article at https://doi.org/10.1027/1866-5888/a000311ESM 1.

    "abstract": "This study examines the interaction between stressful work experiences, workplace diversity, and inclusion. Our hypothesized moderated moderation model argues that employee exhaustion and affective commitment suffer less from work-self conflict, discrimination, and nontransparent work procedures when employees feel included in diverse perceived environments. A total of 1187 employees of a university of technology completed electronical surveys. The results indicated that the negative relationships between stressful work experiences and organizational commitment were weaker if employees felt more included in perceived diverse work environments. Diversity and inclusion did not shape the relationships between stressful work experiences and employee exhaustion. The study emphasizes the buffering role of inclusion in diversifying organizations and offers a better understanding of how diversity and inclusion interact with other work aspects.</p",
