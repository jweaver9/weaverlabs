While such population-based data are rare, Growing Up in Ireland (GUI), an Irish, government-funded, longitudinal survey, includes sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) measurements.This qualitative study responds to a query from the GUI study team and aims to identify howbest to collect SOGI data in future aves of GUI. A university Human Research Ethics Committeegranted approval for online consultations with LGBT+ youth (n = 6) with experiential expertisein policy making. The research is underpinned by rights-based public patient involvement (PPI)with recorded discussions, which were transcribed and imported into NVivo 12, generating thetheme “recognition in research, policy and society”. This co-created article, with the LGBT+ youngPPI Panel members, commends the inclusion of SOGI data in GUI and recommends changes inquestion placement and phrasing. Aligning with best practice, the PPI members provide a templatefor wording on consecutive sex and gender questions, expanded sexual orientation identity categoriesand maintaining the existing well-phrased transgender question from GUI. This offers potentialto improve the quality of the SOGI data collected and the experience of those completing thequestionnaire. These findings extend beyond GUI, with relevance for surveys with youth populations.This paper underscores the potential and benefits of participatory approaches to research with youthand views their role beyond simply as sources of data.Keywords: LGBT+; sexual minority youth (SMY); gender minority youth (GMY); Growing Up inIreland (GUI); SOGI measurement; quantitative; qualitative; survey design; PPI1. IntroductionThis co-created article describes a qualitative study into Growing Up in Ireland (GUI), anational, longitudinal survey, which introduced questions on sexual orientation and genderidentity (SOGI) [1–3]. It explores how lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+)youth experience that survey. The study developed in response to a query from the GUIstudy team related to the challenges in capturing the breadth of diversity within youthidentities and orientations and asked about better SOGI question wording for future datacollection [4]. It contributes to an emergent research literature, which is driving changes todemographic data collection in population-based studies with youth [5].

This article reports on just one of threethemes: “recognition in research, policy and society”.1.1. Counting LGBT+ CommunitiesThe LGBT+ acronym encompasses lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identifica-tion, with the “+” plus extending to expansive sexual and gender identities, includingquestioning, queer, asexual and non-binary people [9]. The umbrella term comprises sexualorientation and gender identity (SOGI) [5,9–17]. Sexual orientation comprises identification,behavior and attraction [5,10,15]. Gender identity includes someone’s internal sense ofgender, which may not accord with binary concepts of male/female or birth-assignedsex [12], alongside a potential affiliation with a gender community [5,18]. Everyone has asexual orientation and gender identity [13–15,17]. For example, transgender youth mayidentify as heterosexual or as a sexual minority [19,20].Population-based data collection is important, however LGBT+ communities are oftennot counted [13–15,17,21]. As a consequence, estimates of the size of LGBT+ populationsvary [10,13]. Growing research attention to improving SOGI demographic data collectionwith adults has been evident for well over a decade [10], with a special issue in the Journal ofOfficial Statistics [21], culminating in the 2022 NASEM publication Measuring Sex, GenderIdentity, and Sexual Orientation [13]. The lack of standardization has led some countries tointroduce, or develop, recommendations and guidelines for SOGI measurement [16,22–27].This reflects a dearth of prevalence data for LGBT+ populations, and extends to the Irishcontext, with a reliance on approximations in the absence of official data collection [28].1.2. Population-Based SOGI Data Collection with YouthThe focus on adult population-based SOGI measurement likely reflects the limitedavailability of prevalence data for younger cohorts [13]. Research on inclusive SOGI mea-surement with representative youth samples is an emergent topic area [5]. Where such dataexist, many surveys record a higher prevalence for youth than older age groups [9,29–32]This suggests greater familiarization with SOGI terminology, with younger generationsmore likely to have grown up in supportive social environments [21,33,34]. Attention toSOGI measurement with youth coincides with the availability of quantitative population-based datasets in the US, which introduced variables on sexual orientation identifica-tion (rather than attraction or behavior), such as the 2015 US Youth Risk Behavior Sur-vey [19,35,36]. Datasets introducing questions on gender identity are more recent again,such as the 2015–2017 California Healthy Kids Survey [37] and the 2015 Minnesota StudentSurvey [38,39].Survey methodologies are not value-neutral [40], rather, there are complexities in rela-tion to measurement, with a lack of consensus on how to define and conceptualize SOGIconstructs [5,21]. Measures of sexual orientation identification are considered most relevantin determining health inequalities [10,13,16]. However, survey response options for sexualorientation identity are often restricted to heterosexual/straight, gay/lesbian, and bisex-ual [21,27,41]. Further, rather than regarding gender as a spectrum [9,42,43], sex and gendermay be conflated or a single binary measure of male/female used which can lead to “mis-measurement or misuse of the data” [13] (p. 25). Where a separate gender question is asked,non-neutral language, such as ‘other’ may be offered [15,26,44,45]. Inclusion of a specificquestion on transgender identification is rare; and may mistakenly be included as a sexualorientation category [20], or gender response option [38,39,46]. Further, some youth maynot use ‘transgender’ terminology and identify as male or female [5,45,47]. Such issues po-tentially impacts on representation, with LGBT+ youth unable to participate, or accuratelyrecord their SOGI identity, resulting in misclassification and undercounting [9,13,15,19].As such, there are concerns regarding research validity, with an impact on analysis andreporting, undermining the quality of prevalence estimates [13,14,17]. Alongside such con-Youth 2023, 3 263siderations within survey design, there is an equally pressing need for majority populationsto understand SOGI questions [13,14,18].While such population-based data can be rare, it is in this context that GUI is the firstIrish representative study to collect data which included SOGI variables.1.3. Growing up in Ireland (GUI)GUI, the national longitudinal study of children, is commissioned by the Irish gov-ernment, focusing on the lives of children and youth [1,48]. Four waves of data have beencollected from Cohort ‘98 at 9 years, 13 years, 17–18 years and 20 years [49,50]. SOGI ques-tions were introduced in Wave 3 [1,2]. The data collection spans a unique period of time,with Cohort ‘98 respondents born five years after the decriminalization of homosexualityand coming of age at the time when two-thirds of the Irish population voted for marriageequality [51–53]. Cohort ‘98 respondents completed a Main Questionnaire alongside aSensitive Questionnaire [3]. As Figure 1 illustrates, sex was recorded in X1, alongsideother demographic data, with questions on sexual orientation, gender and transgenderself-identification included separately in the Sensitive Questionnaire in Section D titled“Gender identity and intimate behaviour” [3].Youth 2023, 3, FOR PEER REVIEW 3   youth may not use ‘transgender’ terminology and identify as male or female [5,45,47]. Such issues potentially impacts on representation, with LGBT+ youth unable to participate, or accurately record their SOGI identity, resulting in misclassification and undercounting [9,13,15,19]. As such, there are concerns regarding research validity, with an impact on analysis and reporting, undermining the quality of prevalence estimates [13,14,17]. Along-side such considerations within survey design, there is an equally pressing need for ma-jority populations to understand SOGI questions [13,14,18]. hile such population-based data can be rare, it is in this context that GUI is the first Irish representative study to collect data hich included S I variables. 1.3. Growing U     GUI, the national longitudinal study of children, is commis ioned by the Irish gov-ern ent, focusing on the lives of children and youth [1,48]. Four waves of data have been collected fro  Cohort ‘98 at 9 years, 13 years, 17–18 years and 20 years [49,50]. SOGI ques-tions were introduced in ave 3 [1,2].

As Figure 1 illustrates, sex was recorded in X1, alongside other de ographic data, with questions on sexual orientation, gender and transgender self-identification included separately in the Sensitive Questionnaire in Section D titled “Gender identity and intimate behaviour” [3].  Figure 1. Growing Up in Ireland Wave 3 Sensitive Questionnaire overview of Sections A–D, with placement of questions on sex, sexual orientation, gender and transgender identity highlighted. Attention to privacy and confidentiality was prioritized during data collection, using computer-assisted self-interview, with SOGI responses provided via self-report from the young person [1]. Following archiving, anonymized data are made available on a confi-dential basis, with statistical disclosure control criteria strictly applied [54,55]. With implications for policy and practice, GUI seeks to ensure that the data collected address identified research needs, maximizing data use [49,50,56]. 1.4. Irish LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy and Youth Advisory Group (YAG) Ten percent of 17–18-year-olds in Ireland identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, asexual, or describe their gender as other (LGBT+) [57,58]. This relatively high prevalence accords with international findings and likely reflects im-proved social and legal climates [57,58].

This relativelyhigh prevalence accords with international findings and likely reflects improved socialand legal climates [57,58]. Despite social progress, subsequent research suggested sub-stantial vulnerabilities [59], and led to the initiation of the Irish LGBTI+ National YouthStrategy [6,7,52,60]. A Youth Advisory Group (YAG) was core to strategic development;the participants of the PPI Panel are members of this group [52,61]. This study is aligned toGoal 3, Objective 15: Enhance the quality of LGBTI+ research research and to:Youth 2023, 3 264• 15(d) Review . . . appropriate language and ways to ask about gender identity andsexual orientation . . . to inform the development of best practice instrumentation . . .for inclusion in surveys and/or Census.• 15(g) Explore Growing Up in Ireland Wave 3 data that captures sexual orientation andother relevant information [52] (pp. 30–31).While policy often commissions research, the prioritization of the research and dataenvironment as one of its goals noteworthy [52]. This accords with NASEM who concludedthat despite increased knowledge of health disparities, “glaring gaps remain, often drivenby a lack of reliable data” [13] (p. 2).Health inequalities for LGBT+ communities can be understood within a social justiceframework, with “recognitive justice” crucial to revaluing disrespected identities [62](p. 12).1.5. Participation as a Form of Social JusticeHonneth’s Recognition Theory conceptualizes three intersecting spheres of recognition:among individuals; within laws and policies; and by communities [63–65]. This tripartiteframework is explicitly extended to advocate for full child and youth participation [66]. Theinvolvement of youth in research is particularly important in light of the commitment withinIrish policy, which accords with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) [67].This offers a framework for the many levels that rights might encompass: decision-making;non-discrimination; direction and guidance; and access to information [67–70]. Despitepolicy intentions, it has been acknowledged that some young people are less likely to beconsulted, and are seldom heard as a result, including LGBT+ youth [71,72]. In response,The Lundy Model of Participation was adopted across Ireland, with an emphasis on theinclusion of seldom-heard youth [71,73–75]. Such rights-based approaches align with effortsto ensure meaningful involvement and engagement of patients and members of the public(PPI) in research [69,76,77]. Described as “research being carried out ‘with’ or ‘by’ membersof the public rather than ‘to’, ‘about’ or ‘for’ them”, PPI is emphasized as integral to healthresearch [76] (p. 1). It seeks to ensure that research undertaken is relevant [66,69,77–79].Participation may be particularly important for seldom-heard youth [66,68,70,80–83]1.6. RationaleAttending to SOGI placement and phrasing in population-based survey design istimely; better SOGI measurement will improve the ability to identify LGBT+ youth, gen-erate more accurate prevalence estimates and understand the lived experience of thesepopulations [13,14,17]. While the study developed in response to a query regarding GUI [4],it has broader relevance as the first Growing Up study with a representative, longitudinaldataset that includes SOGI variables [1,49,50,56]. This study may be of interest to otherGrowing Up projects in other jurisdictions: Australia, New Zealand and Scotland. It mayalso be of broader global interest, given the recent availability of population-based datasetswith youth samples, driving interest in this emergent topic area [5].While cognitive testing is typically used for exploration of survey design [84], thismore comprehensive study, recognises the complexity of SOGI measurement, and accordswith NASEM recommendations for “expanded testing among youth” [13] (p. 13). PPI is em-phasised as integral to research in the health context, increasing effectiveness, strengtheningmethodological rigor, and enhancing both the quality and relevance of the research [78]. Tothe best of our knowledge, this study is unique in exploring the views of LGBT+ youth onSOGI question placement and phrasing within quantitative surveys.2.

This Project is described elsewhere [6]. The PPI participants involvedin this study are all involved in the larger project. The Standards for Reporting QualitativeResearch (SRQR) were followed [85] (see Appendix A, Table A1).2.1. Aim and ObjectivesThis study explored PPI Panel members insights into SOGI question design in GUI.The overarching aim was to generate suggestions for possible changes to SOGI questionplacement and phrasing for future GUI data collection. This sought to improve both thedata and the experience of the respondents asked to provide those data, enhancing dataquality [5,15].2.2. Researcher Characteristics and ReflexivityThe first author and lead researcher (N.C.) was a member of the Oversight Committee,while the PPI Panel were former YAG members for the Strategy [6,7,52]. In this capacitythey were consulted on the wording of SOGI questions for the Strategy’s nationwide con-sultations and questionnaire, gaining awareness of the challenges in survey design [52].Drawing from this experience, alongside their lived experience, the PPI Panel was uniquelypositioned to provide valuable insights. Their experiential expertize spans the Irish mar-riage equality referendum, introduction of legal gender recognition by self-identificationfor adults, SOGI data collection with Cohort ‘98 in GUI, alongside their involvement inthe Strategy [28,51–53,60]. Insider research is considered beneficial in studies with LGBT+communities [86]. The “explicit incorporation” of experiential knowledge in research [87](p. 225), accords with PPI [69,76–79]. Within ethnographic approaches, researcher subjec-tivity and positionality are regarded as integral, with an emphasis on reflexivity [8,88,89].‘Emic’ and ‘etic’ are used to contrast research participants’ experiential expertise (emic), withresearcher knowledge (etic) [88,89]. Problematizing this artificial binary dichotomy, a memowriting approach was adopted by the lead author, providing a reflexive resource [8,87].2.3.

Ethical ConsiderationsEthical approval was granted by a university Human Research Ethics Committee.Information sheets about the study, outlining the purpose of the research and what partici-pation involved, alongside details of the consultations using online forums, were forwardedto young people who expressed interest in the study (n = 12) (see File S1). In accordancewith statistical data control measures, and to prevent identity disclosure, ethical approvalspecifically stated that no GUI Cohort ‘98 respondents would be recruited. There was nooverlap between the PPI participants and the GUI Cohort ‘98 respondents. The voluntaryand informed consent of each PPI Panel member was obtained prior to participation (n = 6).A de-identification strategy was adopted through consultation, with unattributed, anony-mous quotes presented in tabular format. PPI Panel members were given a nominal gratuityfor each stage of the information–consultation–reflection cycle, in acknowledgement oftheir time and contribution.2.5. Data CollectionOnline qualitative consultations (one-to-one, pair and group) provided data on thesurvey design and SOGI questionnaire items in GUI. In advance of meetings via ZOOM™,PPI Panel members listened to a Gallup podcast [92], read a newspaper article, [93] andan Op-ed [58]. The first and second author facilitated an online discussion and Q&A onmeasuring LGBT+ communities with a recognized expert on the geography and demogra-phy of LGBT+ populations (see File S1). The first author used the presentation and Q&A toiteratively develop a topic schedule, incorporating the following topics: survey methodol-ogy, data collection, confidentiality, questionnaire design, data access, what was measuredand how this was measured (see File S1). Between April 2021 and June 2022, four roundsof data collection took place, complemented by two rounds of member reflections. Finalfeedback sessions were held in September 2022, with the lead researcher (N.C.) sharingfindings in the context of best practice [5,10,13–15,17,41,44–46]. This process of dialogueand feedback, while time consuming, accords with rights-based PPI [67–70].2.6. Data Management and AnalysisOnline consultations were transcribed verbatim by the lead author, facilitating fullimmersion in the data. Transcripts were imported into NVivo 12 (QSR International PtyLtd. Version 12). Codebook thematic analysis offers a pragmatic approach in “meetingpredetermined information needs” [94] (p. 7). The data were initially analysed usingan inductive open coding technique, with preliminary coding completed twice. Outputswere shared with co-authors, with similar codes grouped together, collapsed, expandedor renamed [94], through an iterative “critical friends” process [95] (p. 113). Themes weregenerated through moving between the data and codes, with close consideration of theproject aims [61]. PPI Panel members actively engaged in this process, providing richinsights and deepening understandings on issues that they felt were important [96,97].Youth 2023, 3 267Patterns of broader significance strengthened this process through description and analysisof the rich data [98]. Allowing sufficient time, beyond once-off consultations, or occasionalinvolvement [61,66,69,76–79,81,82], alongside an emphasis on research processes and rela-tionships [8], resulted in a nuanced and complex consideration of the topic. This reflectsthe term crystallization, described by Tracy and Hinrichs, where the goal is to develop amore rigorous, complex, multi-dimensional interpretation, enhancing trustworthiness [98],described elsewhere [6]. During a further analysis of the data while writing this paper,with the second author acting as a reflexive partner, it was determined that the results anddiscussion would be combined in order to contextualize the PPI Panel members’ viewswithin the literature, alongside researcher interpretations [94,99].3. Results and DiscussionThis qualitative data collection project focuses on assessing the utility and accessibilityof SOGI data collection in GUI. Results are presented with accompanying discussion, inorder to draw connections between PPI Panel members’ reflections, reflexive memo writing,expert consultation, and the extant literature on SOGI measurement. Combining theresults and discussion enabled important exploration of contextual experiences (e.g., socialchange as a backdrop to the GUI survey), and within cultural perceptions (e.g., improveddata collection, improved respondent experience), in shaping the PPI Panel members’perspectives and priorities [94,99]. Situating the joint analysis and interpretation withinbroader social and cultural contexts recognizes that: “[w]ithout the voice of youth, researchcan miss the contextual input necessary to represent the unique youth experience” [80](p. 177). Through codebook analysis, the theme “recognition in research, policy and society”was generated.

Figure 2. Coding concepts and developing categories for overarching theme “recognition in re-search, policy and society”. 3.1. Context, Documenting Change over Time and Usefulness of Data Figure 2. Coding concepts and developing categories for overarching theme “recognition in research,policy and society”.3.1. Context, Documenting Change over Time and Usefulness of DataPPI Panel members spoke about the changing social context within which data werecollected for GUI, highlighting their awareness of social change resulting in increased LGBT+acceptance in Ireland, which in turn led to increased LGBT+ visibility [28,33,34,51–53,60]. Thequalitative narratives highlight an improved social climate for LGBT+ communities withinthe lifetime of PPI Panel members and GUI respondents [28,33,34,51–53,60] (Table 2). GUIprovides a unique opportunity to track further progress. Half the PPI Panel spent theirchildhood and adolescence in rural areas, commenting on expectations of shifts acrosstime and geography, with GUI providing important forms of data comparability. Drawingon their experience of participatory policy making for the Strategy, PPI Panel membershighlighted the policy implications, emphasizing how valuable the GUI data are. Thisincludes the potential to provide an evidence base for assessing policy efforts to addressacknowledged health disparities [56]. The PPI Panel were attuned to the benefits of GUIYouth 2023, 3 268as a population-based, longitudinal study, describing this as ‘the gold standard’ [13]. Thisechoes commitments within Irish policy to “ensure that disaggregated data on the LGBTI+population and their needs is collected in national surveys where relevant” [53] (p. 19).This reflects calls within the international literature for the routine collection of SOGI datawithin population-based, representative surveys, with both longitudinal and cross-sectionaldesigns, and within the Census [13–16,21].Table 2. PPI Panel members’ reflections on the social context for the Growing Up in Ireland survey.Social Context Quotations to Illustrate PPI Panel Members’ Perspectives and PrioritiesSurvey ContextSocial acceptance“Really good timing that the Growing Up in Ireland has respondents born after decriminalization and whocame of age at a time of marriage equality.So, it’s an interesting time that this data covers”.“Identity ebbs and flows and changes all the time. These young people could be in their 70s and be asked thesame question and give a different answer, when the Growing Up in Ireland survey turns into the Growing Oldin Ireland survey”.“As societal acceptance increases and things continue to change, it will be interesting to see how that datachanges with this wider change, because it’s longitudinal . . . Or that with the impact of living in a ruralcommunity, we don’t see those changes.”Valuable data“They are official and without them people are not represented. So, it is very important to have data.It’s so hardto get that information. I would always be excited about this”.“It is very powerful for people – in terms of justifying and explaining their experiences and verifying the needsof the community—people who will give funding, who will give rights; people who have the power to do thingsthat will improve these experiences”.“A project like this that’s longitudinal and representative is the gold standard for people to use. Especially forLGBT+ young people about what the world is like at this age, and across different points in time.”3.2. Survey DesignDiscussions included research validity—the extent to which concepts are accuratelymeasured in surveys. They considered the survey design in relation to the title and thealignment of questions. As illustrated in Table 3, PPI Panel members reviewed the descrip-tion of the survey as a “Sensitive Questionnaire”. They concluded the use of sensitivehas a “connotation of additional needed privacy.” This may reflect historic concerns athow SOGI information has been used or shared [15]. With privacy and confidentialitystrictly observed within GUI, this may provide reassurance [3,48,54,55]. This accords withrecommended strategies to improve SOGI measurement [5,22,100]. Rather than sensitiveinformation, LGBT+ identification is considered a positive aspect of identity (Table 3).Implicit assumptions that LGBT+ populations are less likely to participate in surveysare not supported in the literature [14,101]. PPI Panel members suggested the use of“Supplementary Questionnaire” was more appropriate.Youth 2023, 3 269Table 3. PPI Panel members’ reflections on research validity and SOGI survey design.Survey Design Quotations to Illustrate PPI Panel Members’ Perspectives and PrioritiesRealigning GUI QuestionsSurvey title“So, they’ve put down gender and sexuality as a sensitive topic.I wouldn’t see it as being a ‘sensitive’topic.It gives a different sort of message to the young person, to the researchers, to the parents as well,if it’s ‘sensitive’It is far safer to say ‘supplementary’ because if it’s ‘sensitive’ there are connotations of additionalneeded privacy. If it’s ‘supplementary’ it’s just extra questions”.Demographic data“I can’t quite fathom why that’s so separate from general demographic info. I would always putquestions like this in a demographic section. My instinct is that’s where they should go. Theinformation is functionally about demographics—in terms of asking if somebody is LGBT+, it’s ademographic question”.“It seems out of place, if that makes sense. I nearly think that Section D was to try to find somewhereto put the sexual orientation and gender identity questions in. So yeah, definitely that question ordershould be re-jigged”.The questions about talking openly about sex could easily go into the sex education section. Then youput the questions about boyfriends and girlfriends into the relationship section. It basically leaves thesexual orientation and gender identity questions sitting on their own—and theyshould just bedemographic—sothey wouldn’t need a Section D”.Separating data collection of sexand gender“One of the things that strikes me that at the beginning of the questionnaire they ask sex with twooptions: male/female. Then later on in Section D they ask a gender question with options:male/female/other/prefer not to say—when they’ve already asked about the young person’s sex”.“Otherwise, it becomes, ‘Don’t you believe me, or did I give you the wrong answer?’ Especiallybecause they didn’t give the option earlier for people to express themselves”.“Were they expecting a trans person to put down their assigned gender in response to male/female?And then a few questions later put down their gender identity and whether they were trans? It can’tjust be ‘what is your sex?”Discussing sex with parents“That’s the order with this question? ‘Do you find it hard to talk about sex with your parents and areyou gay?’ One of the biggest worries that young LGBT+ people first have is ‘What will myparents think?’”.“I think it would have an impact on how people might answer. It might be very difficult to answer thesexual orientation question. If someone thinks ‘I can’t talk to my father about sex, let alone sexualityand gender, I can’t be out, I’m just going to put something else’.”“They don’t ask whether you can talk openly about sexual orientation or gender identity with yourparents, it’s specifically about talking openly about sexual intercourse.They have a question on sexeducation, so those questions would be much better placed in that section, because the primaryeducator is a parent”.Youth 2023, 3 270Realigning GUI QuestionsSOGI data were consistently and repeatedly described as demographic data by the PPIPanel (Table 3). However, in GUI, SOGI data have been separated from other demographicdata, such as sex and date of birth, and are included in Section D labeled “Gender identityand intimate behaviour” (Figure 1). This reflects a wider pattern noted in the literaturewhere SOGI data collection “are often separated from other demographic measures” [14](p. 1). Discussions with the PPI Panel concluded that SOGI questions are more appropri-ately placed within demographic data collection, in this case alongside date of birth. Theyoffered suggestions for realigning the questions (Table 3 and Figure 3). These suggestionsaccord with recommendations in the literature [13,14,18,25,45].The importance of realigning Section D was perhaps most starkly noted with the sepa-ration of the collection of demographic data, with X1 asking about sex, with binary responseoptions of male/female and Section D3 categories: male/female/other/prefer not to say(Figure 1). The PPI Panel worried that the separation of the collection of these demographicdata had the potential to negatively impact on Cohort ‘98 respondents, particularly whenthey were not given an earlier opportunity to self-identify, leading to discomfort (Table 3).Such concerns reflect the emergent literature [26,42–44,46]. There was consensus that con-secutive sex and gender questions would better align with the collection of demographicdata at the beginning of the questionnaire, reflecting best practice [13,14,24,25,44–46]. Theuse of two-step processes, with birth-assigned sex, followed by a gender question withexpanded options, beyond a male/female binary, offers the potential for “nuanced, tailoredanalyses that better reflect unique experiences within this population” [46] (p. 249).Youth 2023, 3, FOR PEER REVIEW 10   SOGI data were consistently and repeatedly described as demographic data by the PPI Panel (Table 3).

Realigning Section D questions with SOGI questions placed in Section X with demographic questions. The importance of realigning Section D was perhaps most starkly noted with the sep-aration of the collection of demographic data, with X1 asking about sex, with binary re-sponse options of male/female and Section D3 categories: male/female/other/prefer not to say (Figure 1). The PPI Panel worried that the separation of the collection of these demo-graphic data had the potential to negatively impact on Cohort ‘98 respondents, particu-larly when they were not given an earlier opportunity to self-identify, leading to discom-fort (Table 3). Such concerns reflect the emergent literature [26,42–44,46]. There was con-sensus that consecutive sex and gender questions would better align with the collection of demographic data at the beginning of the questionnaire, reflecting best practice [13,14,24,25,44–46]. The use of two-step processes, with birth-assigned sex, followed by a gender question with expanded options, beyond a male/female binary, offers the potential for “nuanced, tailored analyses that better reflect unique experiences within this popula-tion” [46] (p. 249). PPI Panel members reviewed the question preceding SOGI questions in relation to discussing sex with parents. They expressed concern that the question order inadvertently suggests an association between sexual behavior and sexual orientation. Section D is de-scribed as “Gender identity and intimate behaviour” [3]. This appears to conflate sexual orientation identity with behavior. The PPI Panel felt this question order could negatively impact on data collection, resulting in undercounting [100,102,103]. They described par-ents as first educators and thought that the questions would better align with Section C on sex education (Figure 3). 3.3. Survey Questions Figure 3.

Survey QuestionsThe PPI Panel also reflected on the phrasing for questions on sexual orientation,gender and gender identity (Table 4). They emphasized that the continued inclusion ofSOGI questions in further waves across the lifespan of GUI may be particularly importantin light of the fluidity of identity [16,47]. It is noteworthy that GUI repeated the SOGIquestions at Wave 4 when Cohort ‘98 were aged 20 [50], and will include SOGI questionsin the forthcoming Wave 5 of data collection with Cohort ‘98 at 25 years [56]. It has beenacknowledged that, for youth who may be marginalized, it is important that they “seethemselves reflected in the questions” [56] (p. 25).Table 4. PPI Panel members’ reflections on research validity and SOGI survey questions.Survey Questions Quotations to Illustrate PPI Panel Members’ Perspectives and PrioritiesQuestion Phrasing: Sexual OrientationMeasuring sexual orientation“Just thinking about identity vs attraction. I know someone who tends to identify as gay, even thoughattraction-wise they often find themselves attracted to multiple genders . . . more in line with pansexuality”.“They’ve got questions that captured identity, despite descriptions of attraction.I think pretty much for my agegroup, if they asked: ‘How would you describe your sexual orientation?’ without having the attraction in there,that could work”.“So, you’re talking about young people who’ve all grown up with marriage equality as a reference point. Itprobably did mean that those young people could understand the terms.Even if you’re someone who doesn’tunderstand ‘heterosexual’—I’m sure my age group would know ‘straight’”.“I don’t like that ‘heterosexual’ is first and gay is second, because, again it’s arbitrary, clearly, but it’s also not andimplies a hierarchy. I am very taken aback by the fact that they have used heterosexual / straight . . . There’sclearly a difference”.Descriptors of attraction“I’m wondering why does heterosexual/straight have ‘sexually attracted to the opposite sex’, but the rest just haveattracted?” That’s a bit leading, it’s like: “So I have to be straight to be sexually attracted, whereas if I’m gay orlesbian, it’s just attracted.[Reading responses] heterosexual: sexually attracted to the opposite sex; gay or lesbian: attracted to the same sex.Well, that’s a really good point. It’s definitely an oversight.I would highly doubt that was something that waspurposely done”.I suppose the asexual part, being a spectrum, to just ask about attraction, is not quite right. I’m pretty sure thatthere are asexual people that are attracted to people, that are in relationships. I just think the part in brackets ‘notattracted to either sex’, that may not be accurate”.Inclusion of pansexual“I think pansexual should be included. I mean if we’re really being inclusive. I have heard people saying: ‘WellI’m not bisexual, I’m pansexual,’ or vice versa”.“I might have put it as bisexual/pansexual because there are so many people who see a relatively wavy dotted linebetween them in their own experience. But I don’t think it would be a bad thing for it to be included separatelyeither.”“With the question about sexual orientation, the bisexual part would assume two genders, so maybe theintroduction of pansexual within the survey needs to be added. Even if people are like: ‘Does that mean you’reattracted to pans, ha ha“.Youth 2023, 3 272Table 4. Cont.Survey Questions Quotations to Illustrate PPI Panel Members’ Perspectives and PrioritiesInclusion of queer“ I don’t know how much of a risk it would be putting in queer. I wouldn’t want someone to be confronted in themiddle of a survey, when it’s not necessary”.“I love it. It’s a very valuable term that a lot of people really love and love to use and there are a proportion ofpeople who are upset by it.”“I have a very awkward relationship with the term ‘queer’. I didn’t see anything positive about it. Now, living asan adult in Dublin, it doesn’t have those connotations. I love the principle of it, I love that it includes everyone”.“My perspective used to be ‘Well, I’m reclaiming the word, it’s my identity, it’s who I am and I’m entitled to useit’. So queer is an identity that I use, but I wouldn’t impose it. You won’t really find anyone who has a neutralreaction to the word queer—you either find it empowering, or it’s upsetting. There is no in-between”.“Because that word was used against people growing up, as a slur, not everyone’s comfortable with it. MyDublin-based friends would have no problem; my rural friends would have a much harsher view on the word‘queer’”Question phrasing: gender identityGender “other” as a response category“There’s no way to capture what ‘other’ is, because like sexuality, gender is a spectrum. So, by just having binaryterms and then ‘other’ it doesn’t allow people to put down what their gender is. It could be that someone is genderfluid, and they don’t identify with gender ‘other’. Maybe gender ‘other’ is assumed to be non-binary, so then thatoption isn’t there for them to self-identify”.“We’re not at a stage yet in Irish society where someone would like casually say ‘gender other’. It’s a lot morenormalized to have fluidity in sexuality than it would be in gender. I don’t know whether, in this circumstance,that could be very offensive or feel like erasure to categorise a number of identities under ‘other,’ which is kind ofproblematic”.“It’s hard to probe into what people mean when they say ‘gender other’ because everybody who’s non-binary, theydon’t all just say ‘non binary’—there’s a lot of more specific non-binary identity labels that they mayuse—agender or gender fluid or gender queer are ones that are more common”.Transgender identification“Having a separate question about whether or not somebody is trans is the best option. So often, the alternative isjust putting trans in the list of sexualities”. When there’s a list of gender options and it’s male / female / transmale / trans female—that’s not good”.“I will say points for the ‘Would you describe yourself as transgender’?”3.3.1. Sexual Orientation Questionnaire ItemsThe inclusion of a question on sexual orientation and the range of available responseswithin GUI, particularly beyond lesbian, gay and bisexual, to include questioning andasexual responses, is commendable (Table 4 and Figure 3) [9,13,21,41,44]. The questioningresponse is recommended for youth population, at a time when they may be exploringtheir identities [5,9,13,14,58]. GUI focus groups with 25-year-olds, consulted in relationto Wave 5 data collection, emphasized the importance of SOGI data collection including“anyone who was questioning their sexuality” [56] (p. 75).The PPI Panel members have a nuanced understanding that sexual orientation iscomprised of identity, behaviour and attraction [10,15,104]. This accords with Guyanwho notes that “how people understand and define their sexual orientation is not alwayssimple” [16] (p. 786). An example was provided of someone who ‘tends to identify as gay’although ‘their attraction would be more in line with pansexuality’ (Table 4). However,they observed that sexual orientation in GUI uses attraction in clarifying language [3].Youth 2023, 3 273There were contrasting views on the use of the term “straight”, with the responseorder potentially creating “a hierarchy” (Table 4 and Figure 4) [13]. It is noted a hetero-sexual/straight sexual orientation was described in relation to sexual attraction, with otherorientations described solely in relation to attraction (Figure 4). The PPI Panel membersobservations are consistent with best practice, which suggests that SOGI data collectionshould not conflate identity with attraction or identity with behavior [13,14].While Spock et al. recommend asking about all three aspects of sexual orientation:identification, attraction and behaviour [5], measuring attraction and behavior pose ad-ditional challenges, requiring further research [4,10]. A limitation of this study is thatquestion wording on attraction and behavior were beyond the scope of these consultations.The inclusion of the asexual option, a rarity in population-based data, may helpimprove data quality [9,13,14,41,44], however, the asexual response in GUI is described inbrackets as “not attracted to either sex” (Figure 2). The PPI Panel members challenged theaccuracy of this description [13,44,105–107]. This may be particularly important as it canbe assumed that young people, universally, experience sexual attraction [105,107]. Thereis a pressing need for measures which recognize broader conceptualizations of attraction,and the absence of attraction, in response categories [13].Youth 2023, 3, FOR PEER REVIEW 15    Figure 4. PPI Panel members’ observations on issues with SOGI phrasing in GUI. 3.4. “Learning with” Young People PPI Panel members reflected on the benefits of collaborative explorations of survey context, survey design and survey questions, As a PPI Panel, consideration was given to the understanding of SOGI questions by the majority youth population and the potential of inclusion through free-text options. The PPI Panel welcomed the opportunity to share their perspectives and priorities. This suggests that reflection on, and evaluation of, SOGI question placement and phrasing may be particularly important for these seldom-heard youth. Notwithstanding the exemplary inclusion of SOGI questionnaire items, the im-portance of the majority youth population understanding SOGI questions was high-lighted (Table 5). Self-identification is highly important, and youth, in particular, more familiarity with, and use a broad range of diverse forms of identification, or reject such labels entirely [4,6,21,44,45,47,109–111]. With the marriage equality referendum providing a reference point, the PPI Panel suggested that SOGI questions would likely be understood by Cohort ‘98 respondents, enhanced by the well-phrased transgender question [3]. This is con-firmed by prevalence findings, using this data [57,58]. Drawing on their direct experience of the challenges they encountered in contributing to the nationwide survey design for the Strategy [52], PPI Panel members emphasized the importance of inclusion for sexual and gender minority populations and understanding by majority youth populations, rec-ommending further piloting. Much consideration was given to free-text response options (Table 5). While self-identification is optimal, it is acknowledged by the PPI Panel that this may be less useful for data analysis. They also concluded that visibility in the response options may have a positive impact [5,21,41]. This accords with Honneth, where visibility is a form of recog-nition [63–65]. This is further emphasized with the addition of a response option: ‘I use another term,’ which accords with recommended terminology in other jurisdictions [22]. While this enables respondents to record non-binary gender identities, it is empha-sized that this is not a proxy to gather intersex variation [13,14]. A limitation of this re-search is that intersex status was not discussed, although stakeholder consultations spe-cifically mentioned the need for appropriate question wording for inclusion of non-binary and intersex youth [4]. The needs and context for intersex youth may not be encompassed by terms related to sexual and gender minority populations [112]. As this is not measured in GUI, it was beyond the scope of the study [3,48]. However, this highlights a pressing need for prioritization of research attention for youth with variations in sex development [112,113]. 3.5. Summary Figure 4. PPI Panel members’ observations on issues with SOGI phrasing in GUI.Discussions also focused on categories missing from the available range of responses(Figure 4). They suggested that the inclusion of pansexual, a non-binary sexual orientation,would be optimal [9,22,41]. There was further discussion about the term “queer”, whichwas not included as a category in GUI. PPI Panel members spoke positively about theterm “queer” as facilitating broader, more fluid forms of identification. This reflects thefirst Census 2021 estimates for England and Wales, which facilitated a write-in response,where pansexual a queer were recorded by responde ts [108]. This is also consistentwith Gallup Daily Tracking data, the large t random, repr entativ sa ple of LGBT adultsin the United States, where res ondents ca record their preferr d sexual orientation [29].It w s also noted that queer may be used in relation to gender, with these questionnaireitems discussed below.3.3. . Gender and Gender Identity Questionnaire It msThe PPI Panel discussed the gender response options (Table 5 and Figure 4). Therewas a broad observation that “gender other” does not facilitate broader forms of self-identification [15,26,44,45,47]. The lack of a write-in response option was noted which didnot facilitate self-expression of fluid forms of gender [5,9,44,45,47]. Such reflections areconsistent with Spock et al., who s ggest response options should offer a range of genderidentities [5]. T ey expressed concern as to whether the use of “other” was literally a formof “othering”, wondering whether this could be offensive r a form of erasure [15,26,44,45].This is consi ten with NASEM, who call for the use of neutral language that does notnegate sexual and gender minority identities [13,14].Youth 2023, 3 274The GUI phrasing in relation to transgender identification was commended, highlight-ing the distinction that GUI provides [3]. This complements the inclusion of a two-stepgender question and acknowledges that some people may not describe themselves as“transgender” and identify as male, female or non-binary [5,9,45,47]. The PPI Panel spokepositively about the phrasing of the question (Figure 1). While it was noted that youngpeople may not fully understand the term transgender [18], they would know whether ornot they describe themselves in this way.Table 5. PPI Panel members’ reflections on “learning with” young people regarding SOGI questionplacement and phrasing.“Learning with” Young People Quotations to Illustrate PPI Panel Members’ Perspectives and PrioritiesEnhancing Data QualityInput into research teams“I think it’s really good that Growing Up in Ireland are asking about this, because it’s allthis language that is really binary, and things are much more beyond the binary”.“It is so important to have input into the research teams, to have that kind of objectivenessand have representation from different communities”.“I’m glad they’re thinking about how to ask these questions. It’s great that it has beenidentified as an important thing to look at when designing these surveys”.Understanding of SOGI questions by themajority youth population“Young people generally know what their sexuality is . . . So, to not understand thequestion would be unlikely. Most people will read a question asking them their gender andthey will know the answer.People do not know they have a gender identity and will say:‘Yeah, I don’t have a gender identity, yet’. Yes, yes you do.They also have no idea if they aretrans or not”.“So, everybody has different understandings of a question. Even if it’s clear to the personcoming up with the question, it’s not always clear to the people answering the question,you know. We have to make sure everyone is included. It’s just that there are people whodon’t know what some of the questions mean”.Inclusion through free-text options“In an ideal world we would use open-ended questions. It’s great for people answering thequestions to feel like they’re being validated. But, you can’t label what someone is saying,you can’t assign them that identity”.“I mean it would probably be great to have an open-ended, qualitative answer box, youknow. If we don’t have language, I mean documented language, on all the varied andintricate gender identities, maybe it might be a nice opportunity to say ‘Can you pleasename your gender identity?’”“When it comes down to actually crunching figures and using the data, open endedquestions are very unhelpful.When it comes to putting that data to use, it’s not as helpful,and I think that that should be the priority. But we need to find a good balance.”“If you’re writing in a response, there’s no visibility. If they’re not out to themselves,you’re still creating some kind of visibility for them, for the first time ever, for the first timein a while, or for potentially what they could maybe tick in the future. To have visibilitythey can see all these options. I think that’s a positive thing”.Youth 2023, 3 2753.4. “Learning with” Young PeoplePPI Panel members reflected on the benefits of collaborative explorations of surveycontext, survey design and survey questions, As a PPI Panel, consideration was given tothe understanding of SOGI questions by the majority youth population and the potential ofinclusion through free-text options.

SummaryWhile acknowledging the nuance and complexity of SOGI measurement, these richqualitative narratives highlight subtle, potentially impactful changes to question placementand phrasing. These observations accord with best-practice guidance in the literature, withbroader resonance beyond GUI. This highlights the contribution of GUI, enhanced by thisco-created analysis, to the emergent literature with youth populations. Fundamentally,it is emphasized that SOGI data are demographic data and are best placed with otherdemographic questions [13,14,18,25,45].Questions about sex and gender should be askedconsecutively, first asking birth-assigned sex, on the original birth certificate, followed by agender question with the inclusion of a free text option This accords with recommendationsfor a two-step process [13,45,46,114,115]. This question format is consistent with recom-mendations from within gender minority communities [115]. A write-in response categorywith neutral language, ‘I use another term,’ is regarded as inclusive. This conceptualizesgender beyond a binary option of male/female [13,22,26,45–47,114].Sexual orientation self-identification is most meaningful in seeking to identify sexualminority youth experiencing differential treatment, with resultant inequalities in out-come [13,14,17,22,25]. There is the potential to enhance sexual orientation data collectionthrough the expansion of response options, such as pansexual and queer, alongside theinclusion of a write-in response option [9,13,17,22,41,44]. This is supported by prevalenceYouth 2023, 3 276data from the US Gallop survey and the recent UK Census [29,108]. The inclusion of a freetext option, would facilitate self-identification [44]. A write-in option may be particularlyimportant for younger cohorts, who use a broad range of self-descriptors [44,45,47,109,111].Phrasing of the question “Would you describe yourself as transgender?” is commended,with the potential for a slight modification: “Do you describe yourself as transgender?”Aligning with best practice, Figure 5 provides a template for consecutive sex andgender questions, expanded sexual orientation identity categories and the well-phrasedtransgender question from GUI.The template is provided in the spirit of contributing to the emergent literature andadvancing the field, and piloting is recommended. It appears that younger people have agreater understanding of SOGI terminology than older cohorts [5,9,18]. For example, it maybe unnecessary to list “heterosexual” as the first sexual orientation response, inadvertentlycreating a hierarchy, or to use “straight” alongside heterosexual [13,14]. Cognitive testingamong majority youth populations would be useful in this regard. Further, attending tocultural and other forms of diversity may be important regarding broader understandingsof SOGI terminology [13,14,18]. The authors recognize the limitations in the representationof diverse identities and voices within the PPI Panel. This reflects the expressed concernsof the PPI Panel regarding the lack of ethnic and cultural diversity on the YAG [7]. At alltimes, it was emphasized that the young people were representing themselves and theirown ideas, and that these would necessarily be subjective and partial [7]. In particular,piloting is recommended with indigenous and ethnic minority populations, where fluidityand blurring of multi-faceted identities may not captured by the LGBT+ acronym [18].While acknowledging the limitations of this study, the collaboration with the PPI Panelexemplifies Honneth’s Recognition Theory [63–66]. This reflects an emergent literaturerecommending collaborations between researchers and study communities in which a“queer approach to data collection showcases the back-and-forth between participants andresearchers.” [15] (p.58).

GUI is exemplaryfor its inclusion of the following: sexual orientation response categories beyond heterosex-ual, lesbian/gay and bisexual; separate questions on sex and gender, with gender responseoptions beyond a male/female binary; and the inclusion of a well-phrased transgenderquestion. A welcome request for improved question placement and phrasing of thesequestions offered a unique opportunity to undertake this study. To the best of the authors’knowledge, this study is the first to explore the critical insights of LGBT+ youth in relationto SOGI data collection. These rich, nuanced accounts accord with best-practice recommen-dations. This attests to the social and cultural capital embedded within youth networks andthe benefit of “learning with” LGBT+ youth. It emphasizes the importance of rights-basedPPI in enhancing “recognition in research”. This accords with Recognition Theory andunderscores the “information power” in these valuable narratives, highlighting the qualityand relevance of these accounts.In relation to “recognition in policy”, addressing the lack of nationally representativedata, which can be generalized to findings from smaller samples, is a priority. While thecollection of official statistics, through the Census, is a stated Irish policy objective, it iswith some concern that SOGI data collection in the Irish census is for consideration only,with no clear commitment to implementation. It also appears that the Strategy objectiveregarding a review of best practice, regarding SOGI data for inclusion in surveys and/orthe Census, has not been commissioned. The routine inclusion of SOGI questions and theirplacement offers the potential to develop standardized forms of data collection, ensuringconceptual precision and enhancing the comparability of studies. This is a matter of someurgency, with far-reaching policy and practice implications.However, the current placement and phrasing of the SOGI questions within GUI mayinadvertently regard these identities and orientations with particular sensitivity. This mayreflect wider societal views and may unintentionally create the impression that LGBT+identities and orientations should be concealed. Self-identification is highlighted through-out the narratives, with broader resonance, given acknowledged health inequalities forsexual and gender minority communities. The importance of counting LGBT+ populationsensures that these marginalized communities count in policy and in society. “Recognition insociety” is integral to promoting the social acceptance of LGBT+ youth. While capturing thebreadth of diversity within sexual orientation and gender identities poses challenges for re-searchers, consultations with LGBT+ youth highlight the potential of creative, participatoryapproaches. The suggested improvements to questionnaire design have the potential topositively impact future SOGI measurement with representative samples. Fundamentally,this will improve the ability to identify and understand LGBT+ youth’s lived experienceand inform future research, policy and practice.Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/youth3010018/s1, File S1.Author Contributions: The qualitative study is part of the larger YuPPYouth 2023, 3, FOR PEER REVIEW  5   2. Materials and Methods As mentioned previously, this research is part of a larger research project called the LGBT+ YuPP Project, which convened Young People’s Panels to garner youth perspec‐tives and priorities on LGBT+ wellbeing. This larger project  is  informed by recognition Theory [63–65] and the Lundy Model of Participation [68,70], and is embedded in rights‐based PPI [69,76–79]. This Project is described elsewhere [6]. The PPI participants involved in this study are all involved in the larger project. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) were followed [85] (see Appendix A, Table A1). 2.1. Aim and Objectives This study explored PPI Panel members insights into SOGI question design in GUI. The overarching aim was to generate suggestions for possible changes to SOGI question placement and phrasing for future GUI data collection. This sought to improve both the data and the experience of the respondents asked to provide those data, enhancing data quality [5,15]. 2.2. Researcher Characteristics and Reflexivity Th  f rst author and lead researcher (N.C.) was a member of the Oversight Commit‐tee, while the PPI Panel were former YAG members for the Strategy [6,7,52]. In this capac‐i y  y we  consulted on the wording of SOGI questions for the Strategy’s nationwide consultations and questi nnaire, gaining awareness of  the challenges  in survey design [52]. Drawing from this  xperience, alongside their lived experience, the PPI Panel was uniq ely positioned to provide valuable insights. Their experiential expertize spans the Irish marriage equality refere dum, introduction of legal gender recognition by self‐iden‐tification for adults, SOGI data collection with Cohort ‘98 in GUI, alongside their involve‐ment in the Strategy [28,51–53,60]. Insider research is considered beneficial in studies with LGBT+ communities [86]. The “explicit  incorporation” of experiential knowledge  in re‐search  [87]  (p.  225),  accords with PPI  [69,76–79]. Within  ethnographic  approaches,  re‐searcher subjectivity and positionality are regarded as integral, with an emphasis on re‐flexivity [8,88,89]. ‘Emic’ and ‘etic’ are used to contrast research participants’ experiential expertise  (emic), with  researcher knowledge  (etic)  [88,89]. Problematizing  this artificial binary dichotomy, a memo writing approach was adopted by the lead author, providing a reflexive resource [8,87].   2.3. Access, Recruitment and Sampling The first author and lead researcher attempted to contact all 13 members of the YAG, through the original Strategy network, with all but one member from the original group informed of the YuPP Project. This is described elsewhere [6], and included in Supple‐mentary Materials (see File S1). Information on the research design and aims was shared with the 12 members contacted. While nine of the 12 expressed interest, six LGBT+ youth were  recruited,  from across  Ireland. The PPI Panel held multiple  roles: as an advisory group for the YuPP Project; as participants in online consultations; in co‐producing re‐search; and as youth co‐authors [61,79,80]. At all times, it was emphasized that PPI Panel were representing themselves, and we are unable to comment on the representativeness of the final sample to the 13 original YAG members. As such, the ‘information power’ held within the sample was recognized [90], and the study did seek ‘saturation’ [91]. Their characteristics are outlined in Table 1. Table 1. PPI Panel member’s characteristics. Characteristic  Number of PPI Panel Members Project, developed by N.C.with oversight, mentoring and supervision provided by D.C.

    "abstract": "The increasing importance of identifying lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+) populations is a key driver in changes to demographic data collection in representative surveys of youth. While such population-based data are rare, Growing Up in Ireland (GUI), an Irish, government-funded, longitudinal survey, includes sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) measurements. This qualitative study responds to a query from the GUI study team and aims to identify how best to collect SOGI data in future waves of GUI. A university Human Research Ethics Committee granted approval for online consultations with LGBT+ youth (n = 6) with experiential expertise in policy making. The research is underpinned by rights-based public patient involvement (PPI) with recorded discussions, which were transcribed and imported into NVivo 12, generating the theme “recognition in research, policy and society”. This co-created article, with the LGBT+ young PPI Panel members, commends the inclusion of SOGI data in GUI and recommends changes in question placement and phrasing. Aligning with best practice, the PPI members provide a template for wording on consecutive sex and gender questions, expanded sexual orientation identity categories and maintaining the existing well-phrased transgender question from GUI. This offers potential to improve the quality of the SOGI data collected and the experience of those completing the questionnaire. These findings extend beyond GUI, with relevance for surveys with youth populations. This paper underscores the potential and benefits of participatory approaches to research with youth and views their role beyond simply as sources of data",
