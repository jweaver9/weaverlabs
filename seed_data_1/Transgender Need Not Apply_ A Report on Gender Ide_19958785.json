Make the Road New York promotes economic justice, equity and \nopportunity for all New Yorkers through community and electoral \norganizing, strategic policy advocacy, leadership development, youth and \nadult education, and high quality legal and support services.\nMake the Road New York’s LGBTQ Justice Project organizes \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning and queer people \nprimarily from communities of color in New York. The mission of the \nproject is to empower these communities through organizing, outreach \nand education.  It is one of the few New York City groups led and \nconstituted by low-income LGBTQ people of color fighting on issues of \npublic policy that have impact at the city-wide, state-wide and national \nlevel.\nIn 2008, Make the Road New York decided to research possible \nbias against transgender job candidates after two of our transgender \nmembers were turned down for a jobs at local fast food restaurants. They\nreported their experiences to Make the Road’s LGBTQ Justice Project, \nwhich prompted us to investigate and document gender identify \nemployment discrimination in a more systematic way.  \n3____________________________________________________________________\nAcknowledgements\nWith a generous grant from the Paul Rapoport Foundation, we \nproceeded to conduct matched pair research into possible employment \ndiscrimination against transgender job-seekers in New York.  We would \nlike to acknowledge the testers for their hard work on collecting the data \nfor this project. We would also like to thank members of Globe, PRYDE \nand the Make the Road New York LGBTQ project for their contributions \nto this project: in particular Candy Ramos, Joi-Elle White and Hazel \nCampana.  We would also like to thank all of the interns who devoted \ntime to this project. This report would not have been possible without the \nwork of Make the Road New York staff Amy Carroll, Karina Claudio-\nBetancourt, Andrew Friedman, Steven Gill, Dee Perez, and Irene Tung. \nThe matched pair testing was coordinated by Chase Madar. We also \nacknowledge Marc Bendick, Jr., Ph.D, for generously donating his time \nand expertise to this project.\n4____________________________________________________________________\nExecutive Summary\nMake the Road New York investigated possible employment \ndiscrimination against transgender job-seekers in Manhattan’s retail \nsector using the research tool of matched pair testing.  We sent out \ncarefully matched pairs of job applicants, one transgender and one not, \nto apply for the same jobs.  Each pair was equivalent in age and ethnicity \nand equipped with fictionalized resumes that were evenly matched.  Both \ntesting pairs underwent extensive training on how to adopt similar \ninterview styles and how to document their job-seeking interactions \nobjectively.  Transgender testers were instructed to explicitly inform store \nmanagers and interviewers of their transgender status whenever feasible.   \nOur research revealed an astonishingly high degree of employment \ndiscrimination against our transgender job applicants.  \n We found a 42% net rate of discrimination against \ntransgender job seekers.  In eleven out of the 24 employers \ntested, the transgender job applicant received no offer, but \nthe control group tester did.  Only in one instance did a \ntransgender tester receive a job offer in our first round. \nIn 2009, we also conducted 82 surveys with transgender and \ngender non-conforming individuals about their experiences in the job \nmarket, not limited to the retail sector. These surveys corroborated the \npattern of discrimination documented by the matched pair testing.\n Of the 82 workers surveyed, 59% percent of transgender \nworkers reported experiencing job discrimination.\n 49% had never been offered a job living openly as a \ntransgender person.\nAlthough New York City Human Rights Law explicitly prohibits \nemployment discrimination on the basis of gender identity, \ndiscriminatory practices are still widespread. There is a clear need for \nemployers to adopt proactive policies and practices addressing \ndiscrimination and for government agencies to improve enforcement and \neducation efforts.\n5________________________________________________________________________\nBackground\nThe Law \nThe law in New York City is clear: Employment discrimination on the \nbasis of transgender identity is illegal under N.Y.C. Human Rights Law § \n8-107.  New York State and federal law, however, do not explicitly ban \ndiscrimination based on gender identity -- though some courts have held \nthat anti-trans discrimination is prohibited as a form of gender \ndiscrimination.  See New York Executive Law § 296(1) and by Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nNo federal law explicitly prohibits discrimination against transgender \npeople in employment, housing, public accommodations or other areas of \ndaily life. Although many courts have held that transgender employees \nare protected under sex discrimination laws, other courts have decided to \nthe contrary.  Thirteen states plus the District of Columbia (New York \nState is not among these) and more than 100 cities and counties have \nlaws specifically prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender \nidentity and expression, which covers transgender people.  \nAbout Matched Pair Testing\nMatched pair testing is a research method used frequently to \ndocument discrimination in the fields of housing and employment.1  To \nprovide reliable data, matched pairs of researchers--“testers”--are \ncarefully selected and trained so that each pair of testers is equal in \nterms of job-relevant qualifications such as education and work \nexperience, but different in one crucial variable, such as race, age, or \ngender.    The goal is to present two applicants who are similar in every \nrespect except one, and thereby to measure the effect of that one differing \ncharacteristic on the pair’s success in seeking employment.\nMatched pair testing is a well-established technique for measuring \nand documenting patterns of discrimination against historically \nmarginalized groups.  Testers have been used in investigations by federal \n                                                \n1 The history and methodology of matched pair testing is described in Michael Fix and Margery Turner \n(eds.) A National report Card on Discrimination in America, The Role of Testing, (Washington, DC: The \nUrban Institute, 1999); Devah Pager, “The Use of Field Experiments for Studies of Employment \nDiscrimination: Contributions, Critiques, and Directions for the Future,” Annals of the American Academy \nof Political and Social Sciences 609 (2007), pp. 104-133; and Marc Bendick, Jr., “Situation Testing for \nEmployment Discrimination in the United States of America,” Horizins Strategiques,5 (July 2007),  pp. 17-\n39.\n6agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the \nUnited States Department of Justice, the United States Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, as well as by the New York State Office \nof the Attorney General.2  The numerous advocacy organizations that \nhave used matched pair testing include the Urban Institute, the \nRestaurant Opportunity Center of New York, the Fair Housing Justice \nCenter, and the Chicago Legal Assistance Foundation.   Data gained \nthrough testing has also been recognized by courts as the basis for \nlawsuits.      \nOther Studies of Gender Identity Employment Discrimination \nAdditional evidence concerning the employment experiences of \ntransgender individuals have been collected by other researchers.  \nAlthough most of these studies address the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and \nTransgender (LGBT) population overall rather than the transgender \nsubset alone, they begin to suggest the likely situation for transgender \nindividuals.\nThese studies have documented the following: \n In multiple surveys conducted from the mid-1980s through the \npresent, between 15% and 68% of LGBT respondents reported \nexperiencing employment discrimination at some point in their \nlives. Some 13%-56% reported being fired, 13%-47% reported not \nbeing hired, 22%-30% reported being harassed, and 19% reported \nbeing denied a promotion. \n In no small part reflecting such workplace bias, various surveys of \ntransgender individuals report rates of unemployment as high as \n60%, and incomes of less than $25,000 per year for between 22% \nand 64%.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, an increasing number of \nemployers are recognizing issues of gender identity in their employment \npolicies.  For example, among firms in the “Fortune 500”3\n 35% (176 companies) among the top 500 include gender \nidentity in their anti-discrimination policies.\n                                                \n2 See Roderick Boggs, Joe Sellers, and Marc Bendick, Jr., “Use of Testing in Civil Rights Enforcement,” in \nMichael Fix and Raymeond Struyk (eds.), Clear and Convincing Evidence, Measurement of Discrimination \nin America (Washington: Urban Institute Press, 1993), pp. 345-376.\n3 The State of the Workplace for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Americans, 2007-2008\n(Washington, DC: Human Rights Campaign Foundation, 2009)., p.1.\n7 18% (18 companies) out of the top 100 now provide \ntransgender-inclusive health insurance benefits.\n8________________________________________________________________________\nMethodology\nOur Testing Project\nIn the spring of 2008, Make the Road New York launched a \nmatched pair testing program to measure possible discrimination against \ntransgender job applicants in Manhattan’s retail sector.  With the \nguidance of corporate law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison \nLLP and the research expertise of Dr. Marc Bendick, an economist and a \nleading authority on matched pair testing, we conducted our research \naccording to the highest possible standards of scientific objectivity, \nfairness to all parties, and scrupulous documentation.  \nHiring\nAfter interviewing more than twenty tester candidates, Make the \nRoad New York hired two pairs of employment researchers.  The two \ntesters in each pair matched in terms of ethnicity, gender and \napproximate age, such that the only significant personal difference \nbetween them was the transgender status of one tester in each team.   \nTeam A was Asian American (of East Asian descent), female, and in their \nlate 20s.  Team B was white, male, and in their mid-20s.  All testers were \nU.S. citizens, and had graduated from college.  All passed criminal record \nbackground checks.  \nTraining\nEach pair of testers underwent rigorous, comprehensive training \nfor their role. This training included advice on proper interview attire,\npractice interviews, development of observational skills, and guidance on \nobjective, factual reporting.  During training, the tester pairs developed \nfictitious resumes that were closely equivalent, with a slight edge in \nqualifications and experience given to the transgender applicant.  The \ncontrol-group testers, both professional actors, observed and studied \ntheir transgender partners’ affect during several rounds of mock-\ninterviews in order to approximate their partners’ demeanor and energy \nlevel.  Throughout all trainings, the mantra was objectivity and neutrality.  \nOur testers’ mission was not to look for bias according to any \npreconceived notions but rather only to objectively report their \nexperiences applying for jobs.\nThis research made strenuous demands of all four testers in order \nto guarantee the highest possible degree of objectivity and thorough, \n9scrupulous documentation.  We believe that the data collected adheres to \nhigh standards of social science research.  \nThe Target Industry\nWe chose to investigate Manhattan’s high-end retail sector because \nthey are a major employer in New York City, particularly for persons \nwithout highly specialized skills.  In addition, it offers positions for which \nour two transgender testers would be credible job applicants.  \nManhattan’s high-end retail outlets are heavily staffed by college-\neducated twenty-somethings, the same demographic of all our testers.  \nAll of our testers had real life experience in retail.\nTesting\nThe testers in each pair would make a first visit to an employer \nwithin 20 minutes of each other and apply for the same jobs.  Testers \nwould proceed until either receiving a job offer or until two or more \nfollow-up visits or phone calls failed to yield an interview or an offer.  \nTesting partners did not discuss their experiences with each other, \nas maintaining an open and unbiased mindset in each encounter with an \nemployer was essential to the integrity of the research.  Only at the end \nof each testing round did the four testers learn about the total results.\nA Note on Selection of Testers\nAs mentioned above, the testers we hired were white and Asian                                                                \nAmerican, college educated, and able to pass criminal record background \nchecks.  Accordingly, we were able to study the effect of gender identity \non employment outcomes.  However, we did not have sufficient resources \nto hire the additional tester teams and conduct the additional tests \nnecessary to study the ways in which these gender identity effects might \nbe compounded by racial discrimination, and economic disadvantage, or \nother circumstances.  Many of the low income transgender people of \ncolor who have been a part of Make the Road New York’s LGBTQ Justice \nProject over the last ten years have testified that the difficulty they have \nhad in finding jobs has led them to drop out of the formal economy \nentirely. We hope that future research efforts will allow us to more \ndirectly address their circumstances.   \nOur Surveys on Gender Identity Employment Discrimination\nIn the spring and summer of 2009, Make the Road New York \nsupplemented our matched pair testing by surveyed 82 transgender \nindividuals about their experiences with gender identity employment \n10\ndiscrimination.  The individuals surveyed had applied for jobs in a \nvariety of different industries, including retail, finance, and education.\nSurveys were conducted at local community organizations, transgender \nsupport groups, and public events. We also collected in-depth \ntestimonies from our transgender testers and other transgender workers \nabout their experiences with employment discrimination. Some of these \ntestimonies appear at the end of this report.\n11\nResults for Control-Group Testers\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3\nVirgin Meg\nastore\nDean & Del\nuca\nTrader Joe\n's\nNine West\nNBC Experi\nence Store\nKenneth Co\nle\nDSW\nBrookstone\nJ.

At both J. Crew and American Eagle, \ncontrol group testers were hired over transgender testers on two separate \noccasions. At only one store, Virgin Megastore, was a transgender tester \nhired over a control tester.\nFigure 1\nResults for Transgender Testers\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3\nVirgin Meg\nastore\nDean & Del\nuca\nTrader Joe\n's\nNine West\nNBC Experi\nence Store\nKenneth Co\nle\nDSW\nBrookstone\nJ.

In eleven of the \ntarget employers, the control-group tester received a job offer but the \ntransgender tester did not.  Out of 24 employers tested, only in one \ninstance did a transgender tester receive a job offer when the control-\n12\ngroup tester did not. At only one store, were both control and \ntransgender testers hired.4 Figure 2 below illustrates this overwhelming \ntrend of discrimination.\nFigure 2\nResults of Gender Identity Employment \nDiscrimination Testing\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nOffered jobs to control\ngroup tester over\ntransgender tester\nOffered jobs to\ntransgender tester over\ncontrol group tester\nOffered jobs to both\nResults of Testing\nN\nu\nm\nb\ner\n o\nf \nem\np\nlo\nye\nrs\nThese testing results confirmed what transgender New Yorkers reported \nin our surveys. \n Of the 82 workers surveyed, 59% percent of transgender workers \nreported experiencing job discrimination.\n 49% had never been offered a job living as a transgender person.\nDocumenting Patterns of Discrimination\nIn our test, we found that employers typically refrain from making \ninappropriate comments to the applicant that would explicitly signal job \ndiscrimination.  In that situation, a transgender job applicant may sense \nthat discrimination played a role but would be hard-pressed to make an \nair-tight claim for employment discrimination without more proof.  \nMatched-pair testing of the type used here is ideally suited to uncovering \nsuch private discrimination masked by public politeness.  In matched \npair testing, an employers’ true reaction to the testers’ gender identity \nbecomes apparent when their behavior toward the transgender tester is \ncompared to how that employer treated a non-transgender applicant with \nthe same qualifications applying for the same job.  \n                                                \n4 In matched pair testing, the  most important measure of discrimination is the “net rate of discrimination,” \ndefined as the proportion of tests in which the protected class tester has a less favorable employment \noutcome than her/his testing partner, minus the proportion of tests in which the protected class tester has a \nmore favorable outcome.  In this study, the net rate of discrimination is (11-1) / 24 = 42%.\n13\nAt the same time, matched pair testing addresses the important \nquestion of whether discriminatory action by a single employer is an \nisolated, unusual occurrence or whether it is typical of employers in \ngeneral.  In our study, the same testing procedure was repeated for 24 \ndifferent prominent retailers in upscale shopping areas in Manhattan. \nThis repetition revealed that single incidents of discrimination \nwere not unusual exceptions but instead were typical of nearly half of \nthese employers.  Thus, the testing program revealed what a single test \ncould not -- a pattern of marked and significant employment \ndiscrimination widespread across this industry.\n14\n______________________________________________________________________\nTestimonies\nJulian Brolaski, transgender employment tester\nWhen I went to apply at J Crew, I spoke the manager, who said she was \nbusy.  I then spoke to a sales associate, who gave me an application, but \nwas vague about whether they were hiring.  I filled out the application \nand submitted it to the manager then and there.  She said she would \ngive it to the hiring manager, and when I asked if they were currently \nhiring, she didn’t say yes or no and said they may call me in for an \ninterview.  Twenty minutes later, my cismale partner Leigh went in and \nhis experience was drastically different.  He ended up getting hired.  J \nCrew never got back to me. I called back twice over the next two weeks \nand they said they were still looking over applications and would call me.  \nThey never did.  \nI was interviewed at a few of the stores that we tested.  At some point \nduring the interviews, I would tell the employer that I was transgender \nand that my preferred pronoun was “he.” In one interview, at DSW, I \nasked the manager whether I would feel comfortable working in the store \nas a transgender person and they said, “that’s up to you.” Can you \nimagine saying to a person of color or a differently abled person that it \nwas up to them to make others comfortable with their presence in the \nworkplace?  I was also continually referred to as “she” despite my stated \npreference of the pronoun “he.” Facing these kinds of experiences over \nand over was humiliating. This process took an emotional toll on me the \nway it does for transfolks who are trying to apply for jobs every day in \nthis city. What is more disturbing than these statements the result that \nthe cisgender, non trans-people were getting offered jobs and the trans \npeople weren’t.  And the results speak for themselves—we found a 42% \nrate of discrimination.  Very few people want to hire a transman, and \nnobody throughout the entire study wanted to hire a transwoman—so \nsexism goes hand in hand with transphobia.  Although this was a \ncontrolled research study, this experience mirrors my real life.  \nYo Smith, transgender employment tester\nWhen I encountered the “transgender employment discrimination \nresearch project”, I was very excited for the opportunity and I felt like I \nwas doing something meaningful for the community I am part of. On the \nother hand, I felt just as much challenged by what I would have to face \nthrough the whole process of walking into different businesses asking for \na job opportunity, just simply being who I am. I am a 'trans woman', and \nthis dialogue between myself and society was just as difficult as coming \nout to my Korean parents in my late twenties. Living as an androgynous \n15\ngay male for the last ten years, I did not ever have much difficulty finding \na job, especially in the fashion industry and the performing arts where I \nhold degrees and credentials.  But applying for retail jobs as a trans \nwoman was something else entirely.  In seeking work at all these \nemployers, I dressed professionally and in accordance with the norm at \ncompanies I was applying to. Most people I met through the application \nprocess were very nice and polite, professional and even friendly \nsometimes. I tried my best to perform as if I were eager for a job and I \nfollowed up without being too aggressive. In all honesty, I really wanted \nto get hired, both for myself and for thousands of other transgender \npeople out there who have been in the same shoes! For some companies, \nI actually went to second and third interviews, corporate interviews, \ngroup interviews, etc. \nFrom this long process of applying to approximately twenty \ndifferent so-called equal opportunity employers, I did not get one job \noffer. On the other hand, I later learned that my testing partner--\nsomeone of my own age and ethnic background with similar credentials \nbut a genetic woman, and who was going through the same application \nprocess at nearly the same time--was getting hired.  This left me hurt, \nangry and frustrated. \nWill it be our children's generation that is pleased to see an Asian-\nAmerican transgender woman helping you with your groceries at Trader \nJoe's, escorting you to a dressing room at Anthropologie, serving you \ncoffee at Starbucks? \nCandy Ramos, transgender member of Make the Road New York’s \nLGBTQ Justice Project\nNot much has changed since the anti-discrimination law passed in \n2002.  We still have a hard time getting hired.  Right now I’m going from \ninterview to interview and as soon as they call my name and get a look at \nme I can see it in their faces.  They pass me up and call other people who \narrived later in front of me.  \nCompanies need to hire managers who aren’t homophobic and \ndon’t hate transgender people.  Companies need to test their own hiring \nstaff, and find out what’s happening.  It’s their responsibility.  \nIf you can’t get a job, that’s really the worst of your problems. If \nyou’re rejected by your family and friends, that’s tough, but at least \nyou’re still there for yourself.  If you can support yourself, everything else \nfollows. If you don’t have a job, you don’t have respect.  If nobody’s hiring \nyou, well, a lot of transgender people are forced into illegal work like \nturning tricks.  We need to work too, we’re not from some other planet.  \n16\nJoi-Elle White, transgender member of Make the Road New York’s \nLGBTQ Justice Project\nFinding employment is a real doozy for transgender people.  I have \nall these skills but because of the way I look I’ve had a hard time getting \njobs.  It makes you wonder if going to school and learning skills is even \nworth it, if nobody is going to hire you.\nThe law in New York has been out there since 2002 but it’s hard to \nenforce it.  Employers are getting smarter is the only difference; they’re \nmore polite when they don’t hire you.  And if they hire you but later find \nout that you’re trans, they’ll get rid of you for no reason.   Like you came \nlate once.  Or they’ll say that you lied on the application about your \ngender.  The real reason they’re firing you is that you’re trans.\nThere really needs to be some enforcement of this law.  Catching a \nfew employers discriminating against us will open some doors.  The next \ntime they come across a trans worker applying for a job, they’ll obey the \nlaw.  \n17\n______________________________________________________\nRecommendations\nDespite the protection from bias under New York City Human \nRights Law, transgender individuals still meet with pervasive \ndiscrimination in the job market.  The 42% net rate of discrimination \ndocumented in our study is much higher than the rates of discrimination \nthat other studies documented against African-American, Latino, female \nand older workers, yet enforcement efforts comparable to those \nprotecting those other groups are almost entirely absent.  Although \nexplicit protection of transgender workers from employment \ndiscrimination is a necessary and praiseworthy first step, it is not \nenough to change employer behavior. We offer the following \nrecommendations to further reduce gender identity employment \ndiscrimination:\nImprove Corporate Policies and Practices \n1. All employers in New York City should adopt policies and \npractices which explicitly address gender identity/gender \nexpression discrimination, including training for employees, \nnotice to job applicants of their rights, and protection from \non-the-job harassment. See Appendix A for model policies. \nExpand Legal Protections and Their Enforcement\n2. Make enforcement of City anti-discrimination laws covering                \ntransgender individuals a high priority use of enforcement \nresources.    Using methods such as matched pair testing, \ncommunity organizations and government agencies such as the \nCommission on Human Rights should proactively identify gender \nidentity discrimination in various sectors of the New York City \neconomy and by prominent employers.   Evidence collected \nthrough techniques such as matched pair testing should be used \nto enforce the law in target industries and workplaces where \nproblems are documented.    \nDissemination of Information about Workers’ Rights\n3. The Commission on Human Rights should increase \ndistribution of information on workplace rights to transgender \nworkers and employers, especially in low-wage industries.  \n18\nExpand Anti-Oppression Educational Programming\n4. New York City should offer comprehensive training about \ndiscrimination based on gender identity and expression to all \nstudents in the public school system.  In the long run, \neducation about transphobia is the only way to address the root \ncauses of discrimination.  The Dignity in All Schools Act, passed by \nthe City Council in 2005 but never implemented, requires the \nDepartment of Education to address bullying based on sexual \norientation and gender identity. \nFurther Research\n5. Using methods such as matched pair testing, community \norganizations, academic institutions and government agencies \nsuch as the Commission on Human Rights should conduct \nongoing research to identify gender identity discrimination in \nvarious sectors of the New York City economy.  In particular, \nresearch is needed to investigate, document, and publicize \nemployment discrimination in low-wage industries and its impact \non low-income transgender people and transgender people of color.\n19\nPostscript: American Eagle Takes Leadership in \nAddressing Gender Identity Job Discrimination\nAfter making the findings published in this report, Make the Road New \nYork filed a complaint with the New York State Attorney General’s Office, \nwhich prompted an investigation at both J. Crew and American Eagle. At \nAmerican Eagle,  the investigation discovered various non-compliant \npractices, including a document that all employees were required to sign\nentitled “Personal Appearance Standard”, which stated that they were to \n“wear gender appropriate clothing” and that “it is inappropriate for men\nto wear women’s products and for women to wear men’s products.”  \nIn April 2010, several weeks after the release of this report, American \nEagle Outfitters signed a comprehensive corrective action agreement with \nthe Attorney General’s Office. In the agreement, the company makes a \ncommitment to amend materials such as job postings, employee \nhandbooks, and hiring guides to include information about non-\ndiscrimination with regards to gender identity and expression.  The \ncompany is also required to train all employees about the new non-\ndiscrimination policy and address dress requirements, proper pronoun \nuse and restroom access according to an employee’s gender identity and \nexpression. The changes will affect all sixty-one American Eagle stores in \nNew York State, employing over 2,000 people.\nUnder the settlement agreement, American Eagle will take following \nsteps:\nPolicy Revisions\n1. Designate an Equal Employment Opportunity Officer to oversee \nnew practices and policies and handle complaints\n2. Amend materials including application materials, handbook, hiring \npolicy, Store Policy and Procedure Manual, Selecting Talent \nResource Guide, Associate Handbook, Interviewing Guide\n3.

    "abstract": "[Excerpt] Make the Road New York investigated possible employment discrimination against transgender job-seekers in Manhattan’s retail sector using the research tool of matched pair testing. We sent out carefully matched pairs of job applicants, one transgender and one not, to apply for the same jobs. Each pair was equivalent in age and ethnicity and equipped with fictionalized resumes that were evenly matched. Both testing pairs underwent extensive training on how to adopt similar interview styles and how to document their job-seeking interactions objectively. Transgender testers were instructed to explicitly inform store managers and interviewers of their transgender status whenever feasible",
