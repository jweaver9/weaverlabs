Shahar Dillbaryt and Griffin EdwardsttThis study is the first to empirically demonstrate widespread discriminationacross the United States based on perceived sexual orientation, sex, and race inmortgage lending. Our analysis of over five million mortgage applications revealsthat any Fair Housing Administration (FHA) loan application filed by same-sexmale co-applicants is significantly less likely to be approved compared to the whiteheterosexual baseline (holding lending risk constant). The most likely explanationfor this pattern is sexual orientation-based iscrimination-despite the fact thatFHA loans are the only type of loan in which discrimination on the basis of sexualorientation is prohibited.t J.

The data unequivocallyindicates that the race and sex of same-sex applicants play a role and result in aunique and previously unobserved pattern. This discriminatory pattern plaguesevery region in the United States, and it transcends party lines (that is, it is presentin red, blue, and swing states). Furthermore, upending conventional wisdom, thedata reveals that big banks discriminate at the same rate as small banks, and lend-ers in urban environments are as discriminatory as rural lenders. Prior studiesfailed to reveal this phenomenon due to data constraints and design flaws. Thesestudies relied on testers posing as applicants, and none could investigate how inter-sectionality influences lending practices.Despite the grim results, a silver lining exists. We find that the pattern of dis-crimination diminishes or disappears in states and localities that pass anti-sexualorientation discrimination laws. These findings have important and timely implica-tions. In 2017, a new bill offering nationwide protection from sexual orientation creditdiscrimination was introduced. The same year experienced tectonic changes inTitle VII jurisprudence. Our study can reinvigorate the debate and help policymak-ers tailor remedies that would correct the discriminatory pattern this study unravels.IN TRODU CTION ...................................................................................................... 3I.

Excited,they filled out the application. But the festive event took a sur-prising turn. The couple was quickly asked to leave and even closetheir existing accounts. \"It was bank policy,\" so they learned, \"notto offer home loans to gay applicants.\"'While recent years brought more legal protections2 to mem-bers of the lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB3) community, our datasuggests that they should not expect to be treated equally. Thisshould not come as a surprise. Federal law and the majority ofstates do not prohibit lenders from discriminating against appli-cants based on their sexual orientation. Simply put, when itcomes to mortgage lending, sexual orientation discrimination isthe rule.Not only is explicit sexual orientation discrimination permit-ted; it can be used by lenders as a \"defense.\"4 This defense is oftenraised when the mortgage applicant belongs to a protected group.For example, a lender who discriminated against a black appli-cant could escape liability if it shows that the source of discrimi-nation was not the applicant's race (a protected characteristicthat gives rise to liability) but his sexual orientation. To be blunt,the bank can claim, \"I discriminated against the applicant not be-cause he was black, but because he was gay.'1 Telephone Interview with Ms. Renee Spears (Dec 30, 2017) (on file with authors);Rebekah Coleman, Gay Discrimination in the Mortgage Industry (Loans.org, Apr 12,2013), archived at http://perma.cc/CC58-DRYG.2 See generally, for example, Obergefell v Hodges, 135 S Ct 2584 (2015) (holding thatstates cannot ban same-sex marriage); United States v Windsor, 570 US 744 (2013) (de-ciding that the Defense of Marriage Act's definition of marriage as between a man and awoman was unconstitutional).3 Note that the \"T\" for transgender individuals is omitted. The reason is that courtshave interpreted the prohibition against sex discrimination to also include discriminationagainst transgender applicants or, more broadly, gender identity discrimination. SeePart I.A. 1.4 We use the term \"defense\" here loosely to mean that the defendant was able toundermine the plaintiff s ability to prove her case for unlawful discrimination. By contrast,an affirmative defense \"is asserted only after the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case... against the defendant.\" See Davenport v Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal PropertyRegime, 508 SE2d 565, 571 (SC 1998) (comparing the defenses of implied primary andimplied secondary assumption of risk).5 See notes 74-80 and accompanying text.The University of Chicago Law ReviewThere are a few exceptions. A small (but growing) number ofstates now prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in mortgagelending.6 Even in states where such discrimination is permissible,some strongholds exist: certain localities decided to prohibit whatfederal law and their state allow. For example, Michigan does notprohibit sexual orientation discrimination in mortgage lending,but the city of Ann Arbor does.7 The same is true for Atlanta, theonly municipality in Georgia to protect LGB individuals.8 By con-trast, two states, Arkansas and Tennessee, prohibit any local leg-islation that would protect against sexual orientation discrimina-tion.9 In these states, the ability to discriminate on the basis ofsexual orientation is protected by statute. Finally, lenders ofmortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration(FHA), known as \"FHA loans,\" are not allowed to discriminatebased on sexual orientation.10 But as the data reveals, sexual ori-entation discrimination-even in FHA loans-not only exists butis prevalent.In what follows, we present the first econometric evidence ofwidespread bias in mortgage lending on the basis of perceivedsexual orientation. Using data provided by the Home MortgageDisclosure Act\"l (HMDA), we evaluate the probability of homeloan acceptance for virtually every FHA loan between the years2010 and 2015. The dataset is unique in a number of respects.First, it is large, containing more than five million observations.This allows us to show that the discrimination is widespread, sta-tistically significant, and robust. Second, the dataset is rich6 For a partial list, see Ending Housing Discrimination against Lesbian, Gay,and Transgender Individuals and Their Families (Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment), archived at http://perma.cc/77JP-JXCM.7 City of Ann Arbor Code, Ch 112, § 9:150 (defining discrimination as making a de-cision based on the \"actual or perceived.., sexual orientation.., of another person or thatperson's relatives or associates\").8 Atlanta, Ga, Ord Ch 94, Art IV, § 94-96 (prohibiting businesses engaged in resi-dential real estate-related transactions from discriminating on the basis of actual or per-ceived sexual orientation). See also Cities & Counties with Non-discrimination OrdinancesThat Include Sexual Orientation (Human Rights Campaign, Jan 28, 2017), archived athttp://perma.cc/6QU6-TRSR.9 See Ark Code Ann § 14-1-403 (\"A county, municipality, or other political subdivi-sion of the state shall not adopt or enforce an ordinance, resolution, rule, or policy thatcreates a protected classification or prohibits discrimination on a basis not contained instate law.\"); Tenn Code Ann § 7-51-1802 (including a similar prohibition).10 Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation orGender Identity, 77 Fed Reg 5662, 5662 (2012), codified at 24 CFR § 5 et seq (Equal AccessRule).11 Pub L No 94-200, 89 Stat 1125, (1975), codified as amended at 12 USC § 2801 et seq.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 5enough to allow us to estimate acceptance rates for perceived LGBcouples of all gender and racial compositions (for example, appli-cations filed by two black males, two white males, a white maleand a black male, two black females, etc.). Lastly, it has a geo-graphical level of granularity that allows us to examine small ge-ographic areas-down to a neighborhood level.The results are alarming. We find that same-sex male co-applicants (or pairs) are between 2.5 and 7.5 percentage pointsless likely to have their loan application accepted compared to thewhite heterosexual baseline.12 This is true despite the fact thatthe same-sex male pairs were identical in all reported respects tothe heterosexual baseline. That is, same-sex male pairs filed amortgage application with the same lender, in the same county,for the same loan amount, for the same purpose, had the sameincome, and posed the same level of risk to the lender. Neverthe-less, discrimination rules. The results are statistically significantat the 99 percent level.Moreover, we find compelling evidence to support the inter-sectionality theory.13 According to this theory, when sex and raceunite, a new form of discrimination emerges that cannot be ex-plained by sexism or racism alone. The data unequivocally indi-cates that, in addition to sex and sexual orientation, race alsoplays a significant role. The result is a unique and previously un-observed pattern. Although applications of all same-sex malepairs are less likely to be accepted, male pairs with black appli-cants are substantially worse off. From most to least discrimi-nated groups are (i) pairs consisting of two black males (denotedblack male/black male), followed by (ii) interracial pairs in whichthe black male is the primary applicant and the white male is thesecondary applicant, then (iii) interracial pairs in which the white12 In a joint mortgage application filed by two individuals, one is listed as the \"pri-mary\" applicant and the other as a \"secondary\" applicant. In our baseline, the white maleis the primary applicant and the white female is the secondary applicant-the most com-mon combination in the dataset.13 See Kimberle Crenshaw, Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex, 1989U Chi Legal F 139, 140 (explaining how courts' failure to understand and properly analyzeintersectional claims can leave subsets of protected groups-for example, black females-without a Title VII remedy, and warning that, \"[b]ecause the intersectional experience isgreater than the sum of racism and sexism, any analysis that does not take intersection-ality into account cannot sufficiently address the particular manner in which Black womenare subordinated\"); Kimberle Crenshaw, Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, IdentityPolitics, and Violence against Women of Color, 43 Stan L Rev 1241, 1244 (1991) (exploring\"the various ways in which race and gender intersect in shaping structural, political, andrepresentational aspects of violence against women of color\").The University of Chicago Law Reviewmale is the primary applicant and the black male is the second-ary, and finally (iv) white male pairs. The differences are signifi-cant. An application filed by a pair of two black males is threetimes less likely to be accepted compared to an application filedby a pair of two white males, and both pairs face discriminationcompared to the heterosexual baseline.Consistent with the social science literature, the data sug-gests that perceived gay male couples are treated differently thanperceived lesbian couples.16 While every possible racial combina-tion of same-sex male co-applicants is statistically disadvantaged,the treatment of same-sex female co-applicants is either indistin-guishable or preferable compared to the white heterosexual base-line couple. Interestingly, however, we observe the exact same ra-cial pattern as in the male pairs: within the female pair group, apair of two black females is the least likely to be approved, fol-lowed by interracial pairs of black female/white female, thenwhite female/black female pairs, and finally white female pairs.This pattern of discrimination is not isolated to a specific geo-graphical region or political ideology. Rather, we find evidence thatthis form of discrimination transcends geographical and politicalborders. In all four regions in the United States, applications ofsame-sex male pairs are less likely to be accepted compared to thebaseline white heterosexual pairs (although in certain cases, the14 See, for example, Nathanael Lauster and Adam Easterbrook, No Room for NewFamilies? A Field Experiment Measuring Rental Discrimination against Same-SexCouples and Single Parents, 58 Soc Probs 389, 401 (2011) (concluding, based on a fieldexperiment, that \"same-sex male couples saw the greatest rental discrimination ... andwere nearly 25 percent less likely to receive a positive response to a typical apartmentinquiry\" compared to heterosexual and same-sex female couples). In two different studies,Professors Ali Ahmed and Mats Hammarstedt found that gay couples are discriminatedagainst in the rental market in Sweden (compared to heterosexual couples) but could notfind a differential treatment between lesbian couples and heterosexual couples, suggestingthat the discrimination was mainly against gay male couples. See Ali M. Ahmed and MatsHammarstedt, Detecting Discrimination against Homosexuals: Evidence from a FieldExperiment on the Internet, 76 Economica 588, 592 (2009); Ali M. Ahmed, Lina Andersson,and Mats Hammarstedt, Are Lesbians Discriminated against in the Rental HousingMarket? Evidence from a Correspondence Testing Experiment, 17 J Housing Econ 234,236-37 (2008). Similar findings-discrimination against gay male individuals but not les-bian individuals-were also documented in the labor market. See Ahmed, Andersson, andHammarstedt, 17 J Housing Econ at 234, 236-37 (cited in note 14) (reviewing the litera-ture on labor market discrimination against gay and lesbian individuals and finding thatthere is little evidence for labor market discrimination against lesbians); Bruce Elmslieand Edinaldo Tebaldi, Sexual Orientation and Labor Market Discrimination, 28 J LaborRsrch 436, 436, 449-50 (2007) (finding that gay men face wage discrimination while les-bian women do not); Gregory M. Herek, Gender Gaps in Public Opinion about Lesbiansand Gay Men, 66 Pub Op Q 40, 58 (2002) (\"[A]ggregate attitudes tend to be more hostiletoward gay men than lesbians.\").[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 7results are statistically insignificant).15 Interestingly, we find thatinterracial male co-applicants (that is, white/black andblack/white) face the most discrimination in the Northeast. Theirapplications are 12.2 percentage points less likely to be acceptedcompared to the baseline (the results are statistically significantat the 99 percent level). Splitting the data by political affiliationdoes not change the results in a meaningful way. It reveals thatDemocratic states are as discriminatory as Republican statesoverall and, in fact, are the least tolerant of interracial male pairs.The same trend also holds irrespective of the size of the lender.That is, big lenders discriminate in the same way as small banks.Using a difference-in-differences framework, we do find, however,that efforts by states and localities to pass laws prohibiting sexualorientation discrimination tend to be successful in discouragingsexual orientation discrimination.The Article contributes to the economic and empirical re-search in a number of ways. First, it highlights a new dimensionof discrimination that has been previously ignored. Surprisingly,of the very few studies that attempted to explore sexual orienta-tion discrimination, to date only two studies focused on mortgagelending. The first study compared the treatment of testers posingas heterosexual couples with testers posing as same-sex coupleswith better credentials.16 The second study was also empirical innature.17 However, both studies suffered from limitations.18 Mostimportantly, their design did not allow the researchers to test howthe intersectionality of race, sex, and sexual orientation influ-ences home lending practices.19 For example, the studies could notanalyze whether black and white couples are treated differentlyor whether black female couples are treated differently than15 See Part II.C.2.16 Sexual Orientation and Housing Discrimination in Michigan: A Report of Michigan'sFair Housing Centers *5 (Michigan's Fair Housing Centers, Jan 30, 2007), archived athttp://perma.cc/CC58-WSN6 (Michigan Study).17 See generally Lei Gao and Hua Sun, The Rainbow of Credit: Same-Sex MortgageDiscrimination and Two-Sided Spillover Effect (Iowa State University College of BusinessWorking Paper, Apr 2017), archived at http://perma.cc/SGT5-MD4M.18 See Part I.D.3.19 In the Michigan Study, the couples posing as heterosexual and same-sex were ofthe same race. Similarly, Professors Lei Gao and Hua Sun tested the approval rate of allsame-sex couples, controlling for race but not exploring the comparisons or interplay be-tween race and sexual orientation. This design did not allow them to address the intersec-tionality question-how race and sex impact the approval rates-or to test how state andlocal rules impact these rates.The University of Chicago Law Reviewwhite female couples. They overlooked the existence and magni-tude of intersectional discrimination and were unable to revealthe patterns we observe here. Second, our study is also the firstto measure the presence and magnitude of sexual orientation dis-crimination regarding mortgages that are subject to the EqualAccess Rule2o-the only type of mortgage in which discriminationbased on sexual orientation is prohibited nationwide. Third, ourstudy indicates that the prior literature may have underesti-mated the magnitude of sexual orientation discrimination. Thereason for this is the failure of these studies to distinguish be-tween same-sex male couples and same-sex female couples. Thedata suggests that the second group-female couples-is treatedas well or more favorably compared to male couples and even com-pared to the heterosexual baseline. Thus, studies that treatedLGB individuals as one homogenous group likely underestimatedthe discrimination faced by gay males. Fourth, ours is the onlystudy to address the efficacy of state and local laws designed todiscourage sexual orientation-based discrimination.Our study also suggests that the observed discrimination isnot motivated by lenders' attempts to assess the risk associatedwith the applicants by segmenting the market. Rather, becausewe compare applications with the same level of risk to thelender,21 it is more likely that the discrimination is motivated bybigotry (conscious or otherwise). The distinction is important. Toeliminate discrimination, policymakers-legislators and regula-tors-must know the motivating force.Our study is timely. In May 2017, a new bill was introducedoffering nationwide protection from discrimination on the basis ofsexual orientation to those seeking credit.22 In the same year,Title VII jurisprudence experienced a tectonic change when theSeventh Circuit held, for the first time, that sexual orientationdiscrimination is prohibited under Title VII.23 A month later, thesame holding was adopted by a federal court in the Southern20 See Equal Access Rule, 77 Fed Reg at 5662 (cited in note 10). See also Part I.A.3.21 See Part II.A.1.22 See Freedom from Discrimination in Credit Act, HR 2498, 115th Cong, 1st Sess,in 163 Cong Rec H 4310 (daily ed May 17, 2017). The Act would amend the Equal CreditOpportunity Act to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in the provision of credit.Previous versions were introduced in 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015.23 See Hively v Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana, 853 F3d 339, 341 (7th Cir2017) (en banc) (holding that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is illegalsex discrimination under Title VII).[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 9District of New York;24 and by April 2018, the First Circuit25 andSecond Circuit26 joined what now seems like a trend.27 Our studycan help reinvigorate the debate and help policymakers tailorremedies that would correct the discriminatory pattern that thisstudy unravels.The rest of the Article continues as follows: Part I first out-lines the law and reveals the perverse results of the sexual orien-tation discrimination defense. It then discusses two importantforms of discriminatory practices and how two common reme-dies-which we later test-may affect these practices. Part I.Cthen turns to review the prior studies and their shortcomings.Part II discusses the study's methodology and the results. TheArticle then provides concluding remarks.I. SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND THE LAWA. Federal LawThe two main federal statutes prohibiting discrimination inmortgage lending are the Fair Housing Act2s (FH Act) and theEqual Credit Opportunity Act29 (ECOA). The first focuses on res-idential real estate transactions, while the second focuses morebroadly on any credit transaction. Together, they make it unlaw-ful for any lender to discriminate against a protected applicant bydenying a mortgage or providing unfavorable terms or condi-tions.30 The federal statutes, however, are limited in scope: they24 See Philpott v New York, 252 F Supp 3d 313, 315 (SDNY 2017) (holding that asexual orientation discrimination claim is \"cognizable under Title VII\").25 See Franchina v City of Providence, 881 F3d 32, 54 (1st Cir 2018) (holding that aplaintiff may recover under a \"sex-plus claim[ ] ... where, in addition to the sex-basedcharge, the 'plus' factor is the plaintiffs status as a gay or lesbian individual\").26 See Zarda v Altitude Express, Inc, 883 F3d 100, 112 (2d Cir 2018) (en banc) (hold-ing that \"sexual orientation discrimination is ... a subset of sex discrimination\").27 See, for example, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v R.G. & G.R.Harris Funeral Homes, Inc, 884 F3d 560, 574-75 (6th Cir 2018) (relying on the SeventhCircuit's analysis in Hively in holding that \"discrimination on the basis of transgender andtransitioning status violates Title VII\"); Wittmer v Phillips 66 Co, 304 F Supp 3d 627, 634(SD Tex 2018) (adopting Zarda's rationale and holding that \"[tihe same is true for discrim-ination based on transgender status\"); United States v Dental Dreams, LLC, 307 F Supp3d 1224, 1253 (D NM 2018) (recognizing that sexual orientation discrimination is prohib-ited under Title VII).28 Pub L No 90-284, 82 Stat 81 (1968), codified as amended at 42 USC § 3601 et seq.29 Pub L No 93-495, 88 Stat 1521 (1974), codified as amended at 15 USC § 1691 et seq.30 See 42 USC § 3605(a):It shall be unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes en-gaging in residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against anyThe University of Chicago Law Review [86:1prohibit discriminatory lending practices if they are based onrace, color, religion, national origin, or sex.31 Although the ECOAand FH Act include other bases for discrimination,32 neither pro-tects against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.33The result is that lenders can discriminate against LGB individ-uals (or those perceived as such) with impunity. There are, how-ever, a few exceptions.1. Discrimination against a protected class.Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation may be ille-gal if it also violates the prohibition against discriminationagainst a protected class. An example is declining to give a mort-gage to a gay applicant for fear of contracting HIV. 34 Such behav-ior is illegal discrimination on the basis of disability-a protectedperson in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions ofsuch a transaction, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status,or national origin.See also 15 USC § 1691(a) (\"It shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate againstany applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction ... on the basis of race,color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age (provided the applicant hasthe capacity to contract).\").31 See 42 USC §§ 3601-19; 15 USC § 1691.32 See 15 USC § 1691(a)(1) (making it unlawful to discriminate based on maritalstatus or age); 42 USC § 3605(a) (prohibiting discrimination based on familial status andhandicap).33 This interpretation may soon change. Many circuit courts view the ECOA and theFH Act as statutes in pari materia with Title VII, which is now interpreted by some courtsas also protecting against sexual orientation discrimination. See notes 23-26. For circuitsholding that Title VII jurisprudence applies in ECOA cases, see Wise v Vilsack, 496 FedAppx 283, 285 (4th Cir 2012); Rosa v Park West Bank & Trust Co, 214 F3d 213, 215 (1stCir 2000); Lewis v ACB Business Services, Inc, 135 F3d 389, 406 (6th Cir 1998). For circuitsholding that Title VII jurisprudence applies in FH Act cases, see Gamble v City of Escondido,104 F3d 300, 304 (9th Cir 1997); Larkin v Michigan Department of Social Services, 89 F3d285, 289 (6th Cir 1996); Cabrera v Jakabovitz, 24 F3d 372, 383 (2d Cir 1994); Ring v FirstInterstate Mortgage, Inc, 984 F2d 924, 926 (8th Cir 1993); Doe v City of Butler, 892 F2d315 (3d Cir 1989).34 See Equal Access Rule, 77 Fed Reg at 5668 (cited in note 10) (explaining that theFH Act \"prohibits discrimination against someone who has or is regarded as having a dis-ability, including HIV/AIDS\"). For similar examples in the context of eviction from a rentalproperty, see Memorandum for FHEO Reginal Directors regarding Assessing ComplaintsThat Involve Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Gender Expression *1 (Departmentof Housing and Urban Development, June 15, 2010), archived at http://perma.cc/LU6T-D965; Fact Sheet: Fair Housing for LGBT Persons *1 (Fair Housing Center of WestMichigan), archived at http://perma.cc/D79Q-EXU9 (noting that the FH Act's protectionagainst housing discrimination on the basis of disability applies not only \"to individualswith disabilities, but also to people who are regarded by others to have a disability whetheror not they in fact have a disability\").2019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 11characteristic under the FH Act.35 This protection includes notonly actual physical impairment but also \"being regarded as hav-ing such an impairment.\"36Similarly, courts have interpreted the prohibition against sexdiscrimination broadly to include discrimination based on genderidentity or perceived gender nonconformity.37 As a result, theECOA and FH Act now afford protection to transgender appli-cants and, under certain circumstances, to LGB individuals.38 Theleading precedent is Price Waterhouse v Hopkins39 a Title VII de-cision. Price Waterhouse involved a female plaintiff whose candi-dacy for partnership was put on hold. It was clear that her genderplayed a role in the employer's decision.40 In addition to legitimatecriticism, some of the plaintiffs colleagues described her as\"macho\" and advised her to take a \"course at charm school.\"41 Thehead of her office-her biggest supportern1--was more explicit. Headvised the plaintiff that, to improve her chances, she \"should'walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femi-ninely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry.\"' 43In a plurality opinion, the Supreme Court held that discrimina-tion on the basis of gender-based stereotypes constitutes illegalsex discrimination 4 The decision was later construed as also pro-tecting transgender plaintiffs. As the Sixth Circuit explained, ifdiscriminating against women who do not wear dresses consti-tutes sex discrimination, \"[i]t follows that employers who discrimi-nate against men because they do wear dresses and makeup, orotherwise act femininely, are also engaging in sex discrimination.' 535 42 USC § 3605(a).36 42 USC § 3602(h)(3).37 The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) adopted a similarview.

Some courts take the view that discrimination against atransgender plaintiff is unlawful only when it is based on gender stereotypes. See EtsittyThe University of Chicago Law ReviewPrice Waterhouse's holding and its progeny were adopted inthe mortgage lending context.46 But even after Price Waterhouse,sexual orientation remains an unprotected characteristic.47 Still,as in the case of disability, discrimination against LGB individualsmay be illegal if it is based on perceived nonconformity with genderstereotypes (a protected characteristic post-Price Waterhouse).This means that a gay male applicant who was wearing women'sclothing would have a valid cause of action if his application wasdenied because the loan officer thought he did not meet stereo-typed expectations of masculinity.48 If, however, the lender couldshow that sexual orientation was the sole reason for the discrim-ination-that is, the applicant was discriminated against becausethe loan officer believed he was gay-the plaintiffs suit wouldfail.49 Put differently, the LGB plaintiff cannot simply argue thatshe was discriminated against because of her sexual orientation.Rather, she needs to show that the discrimination was based ona protected basis like sex stereotyping. As Part I.B demonstrates,however, such a showing is often impossible.v Utah Transit Authority, 502 F3d 1215, 1222, 1224 (10th Cir 2007) (holding that \"trans-sexuals may not claim protection under Title VII from discrimination based solely on theirstatus as a transsexual...

Other courts have taken a more expan-sive approach, arguing that discrimination against transgender individuals is prohibitedper se. See Glenn v Brumby, 663 F3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir 2011) (\"A person is defined astransgender precisely because of the perception that [their] behavior transgresses genderstereotypes.\"); Macy v Holder, 2012 WL 1435995, *11 (EEOC) (\"[Ijntentional discrimina-tion against a transgender individual because that person is transgender is, by definition,discrimination 'based on... sex,' and such discrimination therefore violates Title VII.\").This also seems to be the view of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). SeeLetter from Richard Cordray to Michael Adams and Aaron Tax, Application of the EqualCredit Opportunity Act to Credit Discrimination on the Bases of Gender Identity and SexualOrientation *7 (Aug 30, 2016), archived at http://perma.cc/G6V6-YY47 (CFPB Letter) (re-lying on Title VII jurisprudence to conclude that \"the prohibition of sex discrimination inECOA and Regulation B affords broad protection against credit discrimination on the ba-ses of gender identity and sexual orientation\").

The plaintiff in these cases needs to showonly that nonconformity with gender stereotypes was a consideration even if other consid-erations, such as the plaintiffs sexual orientation, were also taken into account. See, forexample, Centola v Potter, 183 F Supp 2d 403, 409 (D Mass 2002) (\"[Plaintiff] does notneed to allege that he suffered discrimination on the basis of his sex alone or that sexualorientation played no part in his treatment.\").49 See Price Waterhouse, 490 US at 241-42.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 132. Agencies' interpretations and regulatory enforcement.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)-theagency responsible for enforcing and administering the ECOA5O-has taken a broader view than the federal courts. Contrary toPrice Waterhouse, the CFPB's director opined in a letter issued in2016 that sexual orientation discrimination is a form of sex dis-crimination.51 The opinion relied on two grounds: (a) recent deci-sions issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission(EEOC)52 and (b) the theory of discrimination by association. Inthe mortgage lending context, this theory prohibits a loan officerfrom denying an applicant based on her association with a personbelonging to a protected class.53 For example, the doctrine prohib-its a lender from discriminating against a white applicant whosespouse is black. The CFPB's director took the stance that thesame theory prohibits discrimination against applicants based onthe sex of their partners and, therefore, prohibits sexual orienta-tion discrimination.54 Despite the CFPB's expansive view and itsefforts to solicit complaints from consumers, it is unclear how ac-tive and effective the agency is in dealing with discriminatorypractices.553. FHA mortgage insurance and the Equal Access Rule.There is one category of loans in which sexual orientation dis-crimination is wholly prohibited and on which our study focuses:50 15 USC §§ 1691-1691f; 12 CFR Part 1002.51 CFPB Letter at *4-7 (cited in note 45).52 Id at *4.53 The doctrine was adopted already in 1985 by the Federal Reserve in its officialinterpretation of Regulation B. 50 Fed Reg 48018, 48049 (1985). It was reaffirmed by theCFPB in the restated Regulation B. 76 Fed Reg 79442, 79473 (2011); 81 Fed Reg 25323,25325 (2016); 12 CFR Part 1002, Supp I, § 2(z)-1:As used in this part, prohibited basis refers not only to characteristics-the race,color, religion... of an applicant.., but also to the characteristics of individualswith whom an applicant is affiliated or with whom the applicant associates. Thismeans, for example, that under the general rule stated in § 1002.4(a), a creditormay not discriminate against an applicant ... because of the race of other resi-dents in the neighborhood where the property offered as collateral is located.See also Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending, 59 Fed Reg 18266,18268 (1994) (\"A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because of the charac-teristics of: [a] person associated with a credit applicant.\").54 See CFPB Letter at *4 (cited in note 45).55 Unlike HUD, the CFPB does not provide any information about the number ofcomplaints alleging discriminatory behavior. A search on its database yielded only a hand-ful of discrimination-related claims, none of which seems to be in the mortgage lendingcontext.The University of Chicago Law ReviewFHA-backed mortgages. The prohibition is articulated in theEqual Access Rule adopted in 2012 by the Department of Housingand Urban Development (HUD), the agency responsible for ad-ministering the FH Act.56 The rule prohibits lenders of mortgagesinsured by the FHA (commonly referred to as FHA loans) fromconsidering applicants' actual or perceived sexual orientation,gender identity, or marital status.5 7 This means that a lenderwould be in violation of the Equal Access Rule if it denied an FHAmortgage because the applicant was (or was believed to be) gay.58The rule, however, is limited in scope and has-as our studyshows-a limited effect. To begin with, FHA loans comprise a sig-nificant but still limited portion of the market. According toHUD's Office of Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs, in2017, FHA single-family home mortgage insurance measured byloan count was only 16.7 percent.59 That market share drops to13.4 percent if measured by dollar volume.60 The upshot is thatthe majority of mortgage loans are not subject to the Equal AccessRule.Moreover, the rule does not provide applicants with a privatecause of action.61 As a result, the sole remedy available to appli-cants who believe the rule was violated is to complain to HUD.62Few complaints, however, are filed and processed every year, andeven fewer result in a charge of discrimination.6356 See Equal Access Rule, 77 Fed Reg at 5662 (cited in note 10).

Sexual Orientation Discrimination as a DefenseNot only is sexual orientation discrimination permissible, butit can also serve as a \"defense\" in jurisdictions that have not fol-lowed Hively v Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana64 andZarda v Altitude Express, Inc.65 The reason is the law of causation.In a discrimination case, the plaintiff has to show that the lenderconsidered an illegitimate motive (for example, the applicant'srace). In addition, the plaintiff must prove that the illegitimatemotive was the cause of the discriminatory decision.66 Despiteburden-shifting frameworks,67 meeting the causation require-ment is not easy. For members of the LGB community, it may beimpossible.68To illustrate, consider a black male with perfect credit whoseapplication was refused. Suppose also that he came to the lenderdressed in what some would consider feminine attire.69 Here, thebasis for the discriminatory action is unclear. It could be that theapplicant was discriminated against because of his sex (male), his64 853 F3d 339 (7th Cir 2017) (en banc).65 883 F3d 100 (2d Cir 2018) (en banc). Hively and Zarda, which held that sexualorientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination, were decided after the casesthis Section references and mark a new trend. See notes 23-27, 248-49, and accompanyingtext. However, the early line of cases this Section discusses illustrate reasoning that couldstill come into play today in jurisdictions that have not adopted or explicitly rejected Hivelyand Zarda. See, for example, Bostock v Clayton County Board of Commissioners, 723 FedAppx 964, 965 (11th Cir 2018) (adhering, per curiam, to prior Eleventh Circuit precedentsforeclosing complaints for sexual orientation discrimination under Title VII).66 See notes 31-32.67 When a single motive guides the defendant's decision, courts often apply theburden-shifting approach established in McDonnell Douglas Corp v Green, 411 US 792,802-03 (1973). See also Husman v Toyota Motor Credit Corp, 12 Cal App 5th 1168, 1182-83 (2017) (explaining that, in mixed-motives cases, courts apply the Price Waterhouseframework). Under the McDonnell Douglas test, the plaintiff must first prove a discrimi-natory decision and offer facts suggesting the decision was based on an illegitimate motive.The burden then shifts to the defendant to show that the action had a legitimate motive.If the defendant meets the burden, the plaintiff must show that the lender's reason is onlypretextual or provide evidence of intentional discrimination. See also Dee Pridgen andRichard M. Alderman, Consumer Credit and the Law § 3:16 (Westlaw 2017) (noting thatwith the exception of the Seventh Circuit, \"proof of discrimination in ECOA 'disparatetreatment' suits will be subject to the analysis of McDonnell Douglas, as is the case withother discrimination claims, such as Title VII.\"); Ring, 984 F2d at 926 (\"We have no doubtthat the three-stage McDonnell Douglas/Burdine analysis applies to Fair Housing Actcases.\").68 See also Price Waterhouse, 490 US at 251 (noting that mere remarks based on sexstereotypes do not prove that gender considerations guided the challenged decision; ra-ther, \"[tihe plaintiff must show that the [defendants] actually relied on her gender in mak-ing [their] decision\").69 The example is based on Rosa, 214 F3d 213. See notes 74-80 and accompanyingtext.The University of Chicago Law Reviewrace (black), or his perceived gender identity (failing to meet ste-reotyped expectations of masculinity as a cross-dresser). In any ofthese cases, the applicant has a valid cause of action, but thelender may have a defense. It could be argued that the discrimi-nation was based on the applicant's actual or perceived sexualorientation (being gay or perceived as gay). Here, the question ofthe lender's motive is paramount. If the sole reason for denyingthe application was an illegal consideration-for example, themale applicant's effeminate dressing style-the plaintiff wouldprevail.70 In such a case, the denial is considered impermissiblesex discrimination because it is based on the applicant's noncon-formity with sex stereotypes. By contrast, if the sole motivationfor rejecting the application is the loan officer's belief that the ap-plicant is gay, the consideration is deemed \"legitimate\" and per-missible.71 Finally, suppose that the loan officer's motivation was\"based on a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate considera-tions.\"72 In these cases, the lender can still avoid paying damages ifit proves that the legitimate motive alone (for example, denying theapplication because the applicant was perceived as gay) would haveled it to make the same decision (that is, denying the application)73If this sounds too fantastic, consider Rosa v Park West Bankand Trust.74 In Rosa, a bank employee refused to give the plaintiff(Rosa), a transgender individual wearing \"traditionally female at-tire,\" a loan application unless he \"went home and changed.\"7570 See Part I.A.1.71 See, for example, Husman, 12 Cal App 5th at 1182-83 (discussing the burden-shifting procedures in single-motive and mixed-motives cases).72 Price Waterhouse, 490 US at 241.73 See id at 252 (holding that the defendant \"must show that its legitimate reason, stand-ing alone, would have induced it to make the same decision\"). Under Price Waterhouse, sucha showing fully exempted the defendant from liability. See id. This part of the decision,however, was short-lived. Two years later, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991,which severely limited the remedies available to a Title VII plaintiff but stopped short ofimmunizing the defendant from liability. See Harris v City of Santa Monica, 294 P3d 49,57 (Cal 2013), quoting 42 USC § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B):[W]hen an individual \"proves a violation\" of Title VII and the [defendant] showsit \"would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible moti-vating factor,\" a court can \"grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief .... andattorney's fees and costs\" directly attributable to the Title VII claim but \"shallnot award damages or issue an order requiring any admission, reinstatement,hiring, promotion, or payment .... \"See also Husman, 12 Cal App 5th at 1184 (citing Harris with approval and noting thatmixed-motives cases are not infrequent).74 214 F3d 213 (1st Cir 2000).75 Id at 214.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 17Rosa brought an ECOA suit against the bank, claiming that therequirement to conform to gender stereotypes was a form of sexdiscrimination. The district court granted the bank's motion to dis-miss.76 Relying on Title VII jurisprudence and Price Waterhouse,the First Circuit reversed77 It held that Rosa had a valid cause ofaction if the bank treated \"a woman who dresses like a man dif-ferently than a man who dresses like a woman.\"78 Such disparatetreatment based on gender stereotyping would be considereddiscrimination on a prohibited basis: sex. By contrast, if the loanofficer refused Rosa because the loan officer thought Rosa wasgay, Rosa would have no federal cause of action79 The ECOA-like the FH Act and other titles of the Civil Rights Act-does notprohibit sexual orientation discrimination.80The sexual orientation defense carries a number of perverseconsequences. First, it may help explain why discriminatory inci-dents are under-reported. The reason is that the defense allowsdefendants to put the sexual orientation of the plaintiff on trial-even when the plaintiffs case relies solely on protected bases andeven if the plaintiff is not a member of the LGBT8' community.For example, the black plaintiff who sues a lender for racial dis-crimination may worry that she will need to defend herselfagainst the claim that her perceived sexual orientation was thereal reason for the discrimination. As a result, plaintiffs who havea valid cause of action may avoid litigating in the first place. This76 Id.77 Id at 216.78 Rosa, 214 F3d at 215-16, citing Price Waterhouse, 490 US at 251 (\"stereotypedremarks [including statements about dressing more 'femininely'] can certainly be evidencethat gender played a part.\").79 Rosa, 214 F3d at 215-16. The court reviewed the following possibilities:[1] It is reasonable to infer that Brunelle [the loan officer] told Rosa to go homeand change because she thought that Rosa's attire did not accord with his malegender.... If so, the Bank concedes, Rosa may have a claim .... [2] It is alsoreasonable to infer, though, that Brunelle refused to give Rosa the loan applica-tion because she thought he was gay, confusing sexual orientation with cross-dressing. If so, Rosa concedes, our precedents dictate that he would have no re-course under the federal Act .... [3] It is reasonable to infer, as well, thatBrunelle simply could not ascertain whether the person shown in the identifica-tion card photographs was the same person that appeared before her that day.If this were the case, Rosa again would be out of luck.... [4] [Finally [ ] Brunellemay have had mixed motives, some of which fall into the prohibited category.Id (citations omitted). Accordingly, the case was remanded to allow the parties to developthe evidence. Id.80 See id.81 Our focus is on members of the LGB community. See note 3. However, we refer toLGBT individuals when the discussion is also relevant to transgender individuals.The University of Chicago Law Reviewis true for all types of victims, including heterosexual applicantswho belong to a protected class.Second, LGB individuals who do not feel comfortable disclos-ing their sexual orientation may avoid filing discrimination suitsfor fear that they will be outed or simply because they do not feelcomfortable putting their sexual orientation on trial.Third, LGB individuals who are willing to disclose (or avoidhiding) their sexual orientation should think twice. If they do dis-close their sexual orientation, they increase the risk that a courtwill treat their sex stereotyping claims as masking meritless sex-ual orientation allegations. Dawson v Bumble & Bumble,82 a caseinvolving an openly lesbian employee, is such an example. Thecourt was concerned that the plaintiff was merely trying to use agender stereotyping claim to \"bootstrap protection for sexual ori-entation into [the statute].\"83 It explained that \"[w]hen utilized byan avowedly homosexual plaintiff [ ] gender stereotyping claimscan easily present problems for an adjudicator.\"4 The Dawsoncourt solved the \"problem\"-a suit filed by a LGB plaintiff-bydismissing the case. By contrast, in Centola v Potter85 the plaintiff\"never disclosed his sexual orientation to anyone at work.\"86Based on this repeated and much-emphasized fact,87 the courtconcluded that the discrimination suffered by the Centola plaintiffwas likely based on gender stereotypes. This conclusion led thecourt to reject the defendant's motion for summary judgment.8882 398 F3d 211 (2d Cir 2005).83 Id at 218 (citation omitted), overruled by Zarda, 883 F3d 100.84 Dawson, 398 F3d at 218. For other Title VII decisions accepting the defendant'ssexual orientation discrimination defense, see Vickers v Fairfield Medical Center, 453 F3d757, 763 (6th Cir 2006) (citing Dawson with approval); Simonton v Runyon, 232 F3d 33,35-38 (2d Cir 2000) (en banc) (noting that the \"[plaintiffi's sexual orientation was knownto his co-workers\" and holding that Price Waterhouse's ex stereotyping theory \"would notbootstrap protection for sexual orientation into Title VII because not all homosexual menare stereotypically feminine, and not all heterosexual men are stereotypically masculine\"),overruled by Zarda, 883 F3d 100; Ayala-Sepulveda v Municipality of San German, 661 FSupp 2d 130, 137 (D PR 2009) (citing Simonton with approval)..85 183 F Supp 2d 403 (D Mass 2002).86 Id at 410.87 The court noted four separate times that the plaintiff did not reveal his sexualorientation at work. Id at 407, 410, 412.88 See id at 410. But see Dandan v Radisson Hotel Lisle, 2000 WL 336528, *4 (NDIll) (rejecting the plaintiffs claim that, \"if the co-workers do not know his sexual orienta-tion, the verbal abuse can only be attributed to the fact that he is a man\" and explainingthat \"whether [defendant's] co-workers knew or only suspected what his sexual orientationis makes no difference\" because discrimination based on sexual orientation, real or per-ceived, is not actionable under Title VII). Still, disclosing the fact that one is a member ofthe LGB community may increase the likelihood not only of facing discrimination but also[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 19Dawson and Centola highlight a real concern. In many cases,it is impossible to separate sexual orientation discriminationclaims from sex stereotyping claims. Recognizing this difficulty,courts often refer to the line between sexual orientation and sexstereotypes as one that is \"hardly clear,\"89 \"difficult to draw,\"90 onethat \"does not exist,\"'91 and is \"illogical and artificial.92 \"[S]tereo-types about homosexuality,\" they explain, are simply too \"relatedto our stereotypes about the proper roles of men and women.\"93This difficulty has led many courts to outright reject gender ste-reotyping discrimination claims for fear that they are framed tomask a sexual orientation discrimination claim.94 Dawson was re-cently overruled by Zarda, which extended Title VII protectionsto victims of sexual orientation discrimination, but its reasoningmay apply in jurisdictions that have yet to join or have rejectedthe trend. In such jurisdictions, the teaching of cases like Dawsonand Centola is that LGB applicants who want to avoid that fateshould hide their true sexual orientation. The concern is broader.Because the test focuses on \"perceived\" sexual orientation, all ap-plicants might have the incentive to conform to societal expecta-tions concerning gender stereotypes.By contrast, LGB applicants whose sexual orientation isknown to the loan officer may be pressured to adopt mannerismsstereotypically associated with the opposite sex (for example, ahomosexual male may want to wear women's clothing or act fem-ininely). If they do not, they run the risk that any future claimof discrimination will be easily dismissed (because sexual orien-tation discrimination is permissible while gender stereotypingdiscrimination is not).To see this, consider the following example: A married gaymale with a perfect credit score enters a bank and fills out a mort-that a court would dismiss one's sex discrimination claim in jurisdictions that have notfollowed Hively and Zarda.89 Centola, 183 F Supp 2d at 408.90 Prowel v Wise Business Forms, 579 F3d 285, 291 (3d Cir 2009) (vacating the lowercourt's grant of summary judgment and \"holding that [the plaintiffs] sex discriminationclaim was an artfully-pleaded claim of sexual orientation discrimination\" because itsanalysis of \"the facts and inferences in favor of [the plaintiff] leads [to the conclusion] thatthe record is ambiguous on this dispositive question\").91 Philpott, 252 F Supp 3d at 317.92 Id (quotation marks omitted).93 Centola, 183 F Supp 2d at 410.94 As we explain, this trend is changing. See notes 23-27, 248-49, and accompanyingtext.The University of Chicago Law Reviewgage application. The loan officer is aware of the fact that the ap-plicant is gay-perhaps because the applicant submitted a mar-riage certificate during the application process. Based solely onthe applicant's sexual orientation, the loan officer rejects theapplication.If the gay male applicant appears to be stereotypically mascu-line, he may have a hard time showing that he was discriminatedagainst on the basis of a protected characteristic. By contrast, a gaymale who fails to conform to stereotypes associated with his gender(for example, if he wears women's clothing or appears to be effem-inate) will likely have an easier time stating a prima facie claim.The reason is that \"cases applying Price Waterhouse have inter-preted it as applying where gender non-conformance is demonstra-ble through the plaintiffs appearance or behavior.\"95 Thus, unlessthe plaintiff can prove that \"his appearance or mannerisms...were perceived as gender non-conforming in some way,\" his actionis destined to fail.96 In the above example, the applicant's case ismore likely to succeed if he wears what is considered women'sclothing even if he prefers not to. Behaving in such a gender non-conforming manner against one's natural tendencies, however de-meaning and ludicrous, has another strategic benefit. It shifts theburden to the defendant to show that its motive was based solelyon the applicant's perceived sexual orientation.Another perverse outcome-a slight variant of the one de-scribed immediately above-relates to the role of gender-basedstereotypes. Under Price Waterhouse, discrimination based onsuch stereotypes is illegal sex discrimination. As a result, discrim-inating against a woman who walks, talks, and dresses like a manis prohibited. But if a loan officer instead relies on such stereo-types to infer that the applicant is homosexual and then discrim-inates solely on the basis of homosexuality, the discrimination isnot actionable in most jurisdictions.To illustrate, consider again the male applicant with a perfectcredit score whose application was denied because the loan officerbelieved he was gay, perhaps because the loan officer thought heseemed effeminate. If the lender cites the applicant's (perceived)sexual orientation as the reason for denying the application and95 Vickers, 453 F3d at 763 (6th Cir 2006).96 Id (emphasis added). See also Dawson, 398 F3d at 221 (holding that \"one can fail toconform to gender stereotypes in two ways: (1) through behavior or (2) through appearance\"and dismissing the complaint after noting that the \"[plaintiff] makes no assertion with re-spect to behavioral non-conformance\") (emphasis added), overruled by Zarda, 883 F3d 100.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 21can prove that sexual orientation was the sole basis for the denial,the lender will not be liable for the discrimination. The sexualorientation discrimination defense, therefore, allows a loan officerto rely on gender stereotypes to inform the lender's belief that theapplicant is gay and then permissibly discriminate against thatapplicant because he appears gay, despite Price Waterhouse's pro-hibition against discrimination based on gender stereotypes.Finally, the sexual orientation defense likely dilutes the pro-tection afforded to transgender applicants against gender identitydiscrimination. In cases in which the gender identity of the appli-cant visibly \"transgresses gender stereotypes,\"' 97 the lender mayhave an easier time raising the sexual orientation defense. AsDawson and Centola suggest, in these cases, transgender appli-cants are more likely to have their day in court if they hide theirtransgender identities. Thus, the law not only allows discrimina-tion based on sexual orientation but also incentivizes applicantsto hide their true gender identity or sexual orientation in somecases and misrepresent hem in others.In sum, with the exception of the Equal Access Rule, federallaw does not prohibit sexual orientation discrimination when itcomes to mortgage lending. Rather, it views sexual orientation asa \"legitimate\" (if abhorrent) basis for discrimination. The resultmay be under-reporting of all types of discriminatory incidents,more discrimination, and a myriad of perverse outcomes. Both theFH Act98 and ECOA,99 however, left the door open for state andlocal legislatures to provide broader protection. As the nextSection explains, however, the majority of states and local juris-dictions have forgone the opportunity.C. State and Local LawsAlthough all states have enacted fair housing laws, onlytwenty-three states include a provision prohibiting sexual orien-tation discrimination in lending. Twenty of these states also pro-hibit gender identity discrimination. Table 1 lists the states that97 Glenn, 663 F3d at 1316. See also Macy, 2012 WL 1435995 at *9 (\"A person is de-fined as transgender precisely because of the perception that [their] behavior transgressesgender stereotypes.\").98 42 USC § 3615 (stating that \"[niothing in this subchapter shall be construed toinvalidate or limit any law of a State or political subdivision\").99 15 USC § 1691d(f) ('This subchapter does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt anyperson subject to the provisions of this subchapter from complying with, the laws of anyState with respect to credit discrimination, except to the extent that those laws are incon-sistent with any provision of this subchapter.\").The University of Chicago Law Reviewenacted fair housing laws prohibiting gender identity and/or sexualorientation discrimination, including the enactment and effectivedates of the relevant statutes. Finally, two states, Arkansas andTennessee, forbid their localities from adopting ordinances thatwould prohibit discrimination on a basis not recognized by thestate.10  The result is that the same discriminatory behavior maybe allowed in some states but not in others. Moreover, even inthose states that do not prohibit discrimination in lending againstmembers of the LGB community, discrimination may be prohib-ited in certain localities and counties. As Figure 1 below illus-trates, the annual increase in the number of such political subdi-visions sharply increased in 2010 and reached its highest point in2013-the year following the enactment of the Equal Access Rule.100 See note 9 and accompanying text.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 23TABLE 1: STATE ANTIDISCRIMINATION LAWS IN LENDING 1° 1Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityState Passed Effective Passed EffectiveCA 10/10/1999 10/10/1999* 09/06/2011 01/01/2012CO 05/29/2008 05/29/2008 05/22/2014 08/06/2014CT 05/01/1991 09/01/1993 07/01/2011 10/01/2011DE 07/02/2009 07/02/2009 06/19/2013 06/19/2013DC 12/13/1977 12/13/1977* 12/22/2005 03/08/2006HI 07/11/2005 07/11/2005 07/11/2005 07/11/2005IL 01/21/2005 01/01/2006 01/21/2005 01/01/2006IA 05/05/2007 05/05/2007 05/05/2007 05/05/2007ME 03/28/2012 09/01/2012 03/28/2012 09/01/2012MD 05/15/2001 01/01/2001 05/15/2014 10/01/2014MA 11/15/1989 11/15/1989 11/23/2011 07/01/2012MN 04/02/1993 04/02/1993 04/02/1993 04/02/1993NV 06/01/2011 06/01/2011 06/01/2011 06/01/2011NJ 01/19/1992 01/19/1992 12/19/2006 06/17/2007NM 04/08/2003 07/01/2003 04/08/2003 07/01/2003OR 05/09/2007 01/01/2008 05/09/2007 01/01/2008RI 05/22/1995 05/22/1995 07/13/2001 07/13/2001UT 03/12/2015 05/12/2015 03/12/2015 05/12/2015VT 04/23/1992 04/23/1992* 05/22/2007 07/01/2007WA 01/31/2006 06/08/2006 01/31/2006 06/08/2006NH 06/09/1997 01/01/1998 -NY 12/17/2002 01/16/2003WI 03/02/1981 03/02/1981*101 The asterisks denote that California, the District of Columbia, Vermont, andWisconsin did not specify an effective date, and we assumed it was the same as the enact-ment date.The University of Chicago Law ReviewFIGURE 1: THE NUMBER OF NEW LOCAL-LEVEL PROTECTIONSAGAINST SEXUAL ORIENTATION DISCRIMINATION INJURISDICTIONS WITHOUT STATE-LEVEL PROTECTION10245403530252015I 1050 .D. An Under-studied PhenomenonOf the very few studies that investigate sexual orientationdiscrimination, only two focus on the mortgage lending market.103As we explain below, these studies were limited in nature. Thefirst was a field experiment that was conducted in one state(Michigan), before the enactment of the Equal Access Rule, andhad only 120 observations, of which only thirty-six focused on homefinancing.o4 The second, written concurrently with this Article,was empirical in nature.0 5 This study treated all same-sex cou-ples as one homogenous group, it focused on all mortgages (notjust FHA loans), and it ignored the effect of state and local lawson acceptance rates. Importantly, due to their design, these stud-ies could not provide-not even anecdotally-answers to the ques-tions we investigate here. This Section begins with a short over-view of the economics of discrimination. It then reviews theleading studies on sexual orientation discrimination and theshortcomings of their designs.102 This data about local level protections was collected using a number of databases,including Municode, Code Publishing, American Legal Publishing, General Code Corporation,Qcode, Coded Systems, and Conway Greene.

The economics of discrimination.Discrimination in the home mortgage lending process is atopic that has received considerable attention both from aca-demics and policymakers. In his seminal book, The Economicsof Discrimination,1O6 Professor Gary Becker provided a basis formuch of the theoretical work on discrimination.107 According toBecker, some individuals act as though they have a \"taste,\" orpreference, for discrimination against a minority group.108 Butdiscrimination comes at a cost: forgoing profitable transactionswith members of the discriminated group.109Theory predicts that in a competitive market, this cost willdrive out taste-based iscrimination.110 For example, an employerwho prefers to hire only white employees forgoes the benefits thattalented nonwhite employees may bring. Those employees may behired by other firms and possibly at a lower than average salary.As a result, nondiscriminating firms may be able to offer betterproducts or services at a lower price and consequently drive thediscriminating firm out of the market.111 In the mortgage lendingcontext, the cost of discriminating can also be prohibitive. Reject-ing applicants with good credit because they belong to a certaingroup may result in fewer profits and a reduction in value. Thisis the case, for example, if the prejudicial lender reaches a pointat which sales made to his preferred groups are exhausted. Atthat point, the prejudicial lender must either offer loans to all in-dividuals or incur losses. Charging supracompetitive prices to106 Gary S. Becker, The Economics of Discrimination (Chicago 2d ed 1971).107 Id at 14-15.108 See Gary S. Becker, The Economic Approach to Human Behavior 17-19 (Chicago1976). The reason for discrimination may also be the preference of a third party who is in aposition to penalize those who decline to discriminate. See, for example, Cass R. Sunstein,Three Civil Rights Fallacies, 79 Cal L Rev 751, 754 (1991) (providing as examples \"thecase of a shopkeeper whose customers do not like dealing with blacks or women, a com-mercial airline whose patrons react unfavorably to female pilots, a law firm whose clientsprefer not to have black lawyers, [and] a hospital whose patients are uncomfortable withfemale doctors or black nurses\" and noting that, \"[i]n [ ] these cases, an employer whointroduces norms of equality into the work force will be punished, not rewarded\").109 Becker, Economic Approach to Human Behavior at 13-14 (cited in note 108).110 See id at 35-37.111 See id. See also Robert D. Cooter, The Strategic Constitution 340-41 (Princeton2000); Richard H. McAdams, Relative Preferences, 102 Yale L J 1, 92-96 (1992) (reviewingthe Becker model and offering an alternative theory of discrimination, claiming that dis-crimination may be the result of competition over social status between groups).The University of Chicago Law Reviewmembers of a protected group (for example, reverse redlining12)is also infeasible if enough lenders are willing to offer credit.113Markets, however, are not always competitive, and as a result,taste-based iscrimination may persist.114A different theory that explains why discrimination may per-sist in competitive markets, and can even be efficient, is statisti-cal discrimination, meaning discrimination that arises out of arisk assessment based on characteristics commonly held by thatgroup.\" 5 Under this theory, firms do not discriminate becausethey have a taste for discrimination. Rather, in a world of imper-fect information, these firms resort to group characteristics or ste-reotypes as proxies to evaluate outcome-relevant attributes of in-dividuals. In other words, these firms make the inference that,because an individual belongs to a certain group, she possessescertain traits associated with that group. \"In the classic textbookexample, if employers believe (correctly) that workers belongingto a minority group perform, on average, worse than dominantgroup workers do, then the employers' rational response is totreat [the two groups of workers] differently.116 Another exampleis the use of a sex stereotype as a proxy in labor markets. Basedon past experience, an employer may believe that, compared tomen, women are more likely to leave their jobs during childbear-ing years. The behavior is rational and (likely) profit-maximizing112 See United Companies Lending Corp v Sargeant, 20 F Supp 2d 192, 203 n 5 (DMass 1998) (\"Redlining is the practice of denying the extension of credit to specific geo-graphic areas due to the income, race, or ethnicity of its residents.... Reverse redliningis the practice of extending credit on unfair terms to those same communities.\").113 See Gary A. Dymski, Discrimination in the Credit and Housing Markets: Findingsand Challenges, in William M. Rodgers H, ed, Handbook on the Economics of Discrimination215, 220 (Edward Elgar 2006) (noting that the effects of racial preferences in a marketdepend on \"the freedom of market entry, and on whether market participants face trans-action and/or information costs\").114 See Gary A. Dymski, The Theory of Credit-Market Redlining and Discrimination:An Exploration, 23 Rev Black Political Economy 43-45 (Winter 1995) (explaining that dis-crimination may occur if the number of prejudicial lenders is large enough to dictate theprice to the neutral lenders); Cooter, The Strategic Constitution at 344 (cited in note 111)(explaining that collusion by social groups can result in market power).115 See Kenneth Arrow, The Theory of Discrimination, in Orley Ashenfelter andAlbert Rees, eds, Discrimination in Labor Markets 23-24 (Princeton 1973); Edmund S.Phelps, The Statistical Theory of Racism and Sexism, 62 Am Econ Rev 659, 660 (1972);Devin G. Pope and Justin R. Sydnor, What's in a Picture? Evidence of Discrimination fromProsper.com, 46 J of Hum Res 53, 53 (Winter 2011) (\"Accurate statistical discrimination iseconomically efficient for the decision maker, while taste-based iscrimination stems froman animus toward one group and is often costly to the decision-maker.\").116 Hanmin Fang and Andrea Moro, Theories of Statistical Discrimination andAffirmative Action: A Survey, in Jess Benhabib, ed, 1A Handbook of Social Economics 135(Elsevier 2011).[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 27even when the decisionmaker relies on proxies that are \"over-broad generalizations and far from entirely accurate.\"117Redlining-the practice of denying services or raising pricesto minority groups-can be the result of such statistical discrimi-nation.118 Just like employers may rely on sex and race as proxiesfor performance,119 a lender may rely on similar proxies to esti-mate risk. As a result, what might appear to be systematic taste-based discrimination against a minority group may in fact simplybe lenders avoiding loans in high-crime, low-income areas thathappen to be heavily populated by the minority group. Econo-mists refer to this form of discrimination as \"statistical.\" It is alsoreferred to as rational discrimination,120 and some have arguedthat rational discrimination should be legally permitted.121There are, of course, other theories of discrimination.122 Ourgoal here is not to review every possible theory. Rather, followingthe empirical literature, we focus on the taste-based and statisti-cal discrimination theories.123 This focus allows us to reveal andpropose new ways to deal with some of the flaws that plague pre-vious studies. It also allows us to shed new light on and challengetheir findings and conclusions. Finally, these two theories haveanother benefit: they interact differently with the ContactHypothesis,124 a theory we test. Under this theory, discriminationmay be the result of ignorance and, accordingly, can be reduced117 Sunstein, 79 Cal L Rev at 755-56 (cited in note 108) (noting that \"race or sex insome contexts may be every bit as accurate a predictor of job performance as, say, testscores, education, and previous employment\" and that, \"in some cases, reliance on moredirect and individualized devices might be too costly to be worthwhile\").11s See United Companies, 20 F Supp 2d at 203 n 5.119 See Sunstein, 79 Cal L Rev at 755-57 (cited in note 108).120 See Jack M.

If true, the em-pirical prediction is that areas with more intergroup contact ex-perience less discrimination. The prediction holds when the dis-crimination is taste-based. By contrast, contact with minoritiesmay reinforce statistical discrimination if it provides the deci-sionmaker with new proxies that will allow it to segment he mar-ket. For example, a lender who learns that members of a certainminority group suffer from a higher unemployment rate may re-fuse to sell them loans or require higher interest rates.125 If thelender learns through contact that certain groups are less likelyto bargain, the lender may attempt to command higher prices.With these two theories in mind-taste-based and statistical dis-crimination-we now turn to the world of practice.2. Two types of studies: the econometric approach and fieldexperiments.Attempts to empirically address taste-based and statisticaldiscrimination have essentially taken two forms: (a) the econo-metric approach and (b) field studies. As we explain below, thesestudies suffer from a number of theoretical and methodologicallimitations. Understanding the criticism these studies faced andthe methodologies they used not only motivates and informs ourstudy but also allows us to extend the literature on discriminationin mortgage lending to discrimination based on sexual orientation.a) The econometric approach. The first approach is to main-tain data at the individual level and assess the likelihood of loanacceptance. This is an attractive approach because lenders typi-cally have guidelines and algorithms that drive the loan ac-ceptance process. In a leading study, researchers were able to ob-tain all the data associated with whether a loan should have beenaccepted or denied.126 They were thus able to control for every fac-tor that, according to the banks, was a relevant consideration. Thestudy concluded that an application from a black or Hispanic indi-vidual was 8.2 percentage points less likely to be approved than anapplication filed by a white individual with similar bank-relevant125 See generally Stephen L. Ross and Margery Austin Turner, Housing Discriminationin Metropolitan America: Explaining Changes between 1989 and 2000, 52 Soc Probs 152(2005) (suggesting that a landlord may discriminate against members of a minority groupbased on such information).126 See Alicia H. Munnell, et al, Mortgage Lending in Boston: Interpreting HMDAData, 86 Am Econ Rev 25, 32 (1996).[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 29characteristics.127 Follow-up studies questioned the sensitivity ofthis result and argued that, if anything, it applies only to appli-cations right on the fringe of acceptance.128 Others argued that thesingle most important factor to a loan application-risk of loandefault-is not adequately considered.129The criticism that received possibly the most attention wasthat this type of modeling did not address the source of the dis-crimination, such as whether it was the result of taste-based orstatistical discrimination.10 That is, was the observed discrimi-nation evidence of bigotry? Or was race just a proxy for some otherneighborhood characteristic associated with the typical black ap-plication that lenders might rationally want to avoid? Later stud-ies attempted to answer the motivation question by aggregatingthe data away from the individual level to the neighborhood level.These studies found much weaker evidence of racial (taste-based)redlining.As we discuss below,3, we are able to address each of the con-cerns brought up by the racial redlining literature-specificallythat traditional techniques fail to disentangle race effects fromneighborhood effects-in a number of ways available to us,thanks to the thoroughness of the HMDA data.132 By doing so, ourstudy is not only the first to use regression-based analysis tostudy sexual orientation discrimination, but it also invites andsets the ground for future research.127 See id at 33.128 See Raphael W. Bostic, The Role of Race in Mortgage Lending: Revisiting theBoston Fed Study *19-21 (Federal Reserve Board of Governors Division of Research &Statistics Working Paper, Dec 1996) (on file with authors). See generally Judith A. Clarke,Nilanjana Roy, and Marsha J. Courchane, On the Robustness of Racial DiscriminationFindings in Mortgage Lending Studies, 41 Applied Econ 2279 (2009).129 See Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer, The Hidden Clue, Forbes (Jan 4, 1993)(suggesting that the observation used by Professor Alicia Munnell to justify discountingdifferences in default rates between races-the fact that there were no differences in de-fault rates across census tracts that were populated by different racial groups-was recur-sive insofar as the minority borrowers in those census tracts had presumably already beenfiltered through a lender who predicted higher default rates among minorities).130 See Geoffrey M.B. Tootell, Redlining in Boston: Do Mortgage Lenders Discriminateagainst Neighborhoods?, 111 Q J Econ 1049, 1050-51 (1996).131 See Parts I.A-B.132 For example, we are able to limit the possibility of statistical discrimination byrestricting the dataset to only FHA loans. Once issued, these loans carry the same risk tothe bank regardless of any underlying characteristic that banks think they may need toaccount for that is associated with race, or sexual orientation. We also compare changesin lending rates by minority groups from the same bank in the same county.The University of Chicago Law Reviewb) Field experiments. With very limited ability to obtain dataon the individual level, \"[m]uch of the research into housing dis-crimination, including HUD's [Housing Discrimination Studies],\"had to resort to \"paired testing.\"'133 Under this methodology, \"twotesters assume the role of applicants with equivalent social andeconomic characteristics who differ only in terms of the charac-teristic being tested for discrimination, such as race, disabilitystatus, or marital status.\"134While most studies focus on racial discrimination in mort-gage lending,135 only a few attempted to investigate sexual orien-tation discrimination. The first field experiment was conducted inSweden in 2009 and found evidence of discrimination againstsame-sex couples.136 The authors sent out two fictitious applica-tions for rental housing via the internet. One application was sentby a couple with a traditionally male and female name. The otherapplication was sent by two distinctively male names, suggestinga gay couple. Each pair also presented itself as a \"couple\" to ex-plicitly signal their sexual orientation. The authors then meas-ured the rate at which each fictitious couple was called back. Theyfound that, compared to the heterosexual couple, the homosexualcouple was 14 percentage points less likely to receive a callback.137A follow-up study carried out in much the same manner-emailcorrespondence studies-found similar results in the Vancouver,Canada rental market.18These two studies established some initial evidence of thepossibility of discrimination based on sexual orientation, but they133 Pair Testing and the Housing Discrimination Studies (Department of Housing andUrban Development, Spring/Summer 2014), archived at http://perma.cc/652L-CVE6.134 Id.135 See, for example, Lauster and Easterbrook, 58 Soc Probs at 390 (cited in note 14)(\"Much has been written about discrimination in the rental market, but the literature isalmost entirely focused on race and ethnicity.\").136 See Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 76 Economica at 595 (cited in note 14) (\"These re-sults reveal that homosexual males were discriminated [against] since the homosexualcouple in the study got fewer call-backs, fewer invitations to further contacts and fewerinvitations to showings than the heterosexual couple.\").137 See id at 594.138 See Lauster and Easterbrook, 58 Soc Probs at 403 (cited in note 14). The authorfound that, compared to the heterosexual baseline, male couples were 24 percent lesslikely to receive a positive response to a rental inquiry. By contrast, lesbian couples wereactually more likely to receive a positive response to rental inquiries than the heterosexualcouple, though the effect was statistically insignificant. Id. The study also found supportfor the Contact Theory. In areas where individuals were more likely to have contact orfamiliarity with same-sex couples (for example, downtown), landlords \"demonstrate[d]much less discrimination against same-sex male couples.\" (The authors noted, however,that these areas were also the more expensive ones.) See id.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 31have their limitations. Because each study focuses on a specificarea and addresses only rentals, we hesitate to draw too much ofa conclusion about how these results might translate to mortgageapproval rates. This is especially so because antidiscriminationlaws differ from one country to another, as do social norms.A broader concern is whether correspondence studies, whichrely on response rates to email inquiries, can serve as a propermeasure of discrimination. To begin with, such studies struggleto distinguish between taste-based and statistical discriminationbecause the underlying motivation for the housing denial is notknown to the researcher and because the audit nature of thesestudies usually prohibits the use of neighborhood fixed effects.The distinction is critical, as different forms of discrimination callfor different remedies and measures. Moreover, it is also unclearif the response rate can serve as a proxy for discrimination at all.The Swedish and Canadian studies exemplify the problem withthe methodology. In both, a nonresponse was considered a nega-tive outcome and a sign of discrimination.139 By contrast, all re-sponses were considered nondiscriminatory outcomes eventhough there are many ways bigoted landlords can mask discrim-ination through a response. Examples are email replies that raisedifficulties of actually seeing the apartment140 and responses thatredirect the applicant to a different property owner-both ofwhich happened in the Vancouver study.141 It is also likely thatsome prejudicial landlords provide untruthful responses regard-ing occupancy. These responses might be strong evidence of ac-tual discrimination, but they were considered a nondiscrimina-tory outcome.Another major challenge is whether the results, even if takenas valid, can be generalized. How much can a study in Sweden orVancouver tell us about housing discrimination generally in theUnited States? In an effort to answer the question, HUD commis-sioned a similar email correspondence study.142 Touted as the139 See id at 398; Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 76 Economica at 592 (cited in note 14).140 For example, a discriminating landlord could, hypothetically, respond positivelyto the inquiry from the homosexual couple but make it difficult for the couple to actuallysee the apartment. Examples of this in practice may look like scheduling a visit multipleweeks out at an inconvenient time or requesting a phone conversation to confirm a dateand time to tour the facility and never answering the phone.141 See Lauster and Easterbrook, 58 Soc Probs at 402 (cited in note 14).142 Samantha Friedman, et al, An Estimate of Housing Discrimination against Same-Sex Couples *2 (Department of Housing and Urban Development, June 2013), archived athttp://perma.cc/5KXM-T6YZ. Although the HUD study was conducted in 2011 before theEqual Access Rule was promulgated, it was released to the public in July 2013.The University of Chicago Law Review\"first large-scale [ ] study to assess housing discriminationagainst same-sex couples\"'143 on a \"national scale,\"'- the 2011study conducted 6,833 paired email-correspondence tests acrossfifty randomly selected markets. The study found that, comparedto heterosexual couples, same-sex couples-both male and fe-male-received significantly fewer responses as compared to heter-osexual couples.145 There was also some evidence that jurisdictionswith state-level prohibitions against sexual orientation discrimina-tion exhibited slightly more adverse treatment against same-sexcouples compared with states without such prohibitions.146The recent HUD study represents a new and improved gen-eration of field experiments. Together with a recent study con-ducted in the automobile industry, it indicates that sexual orien-tation discrimination permeates many markets.147 But what theHUD and other studies did not and could not test is how sex andrace interact. The automobile study included only white male test-ers, and in the HUD study, \"the only difference between the twoe-mails was whether the couple was same sex or heterosexual.\"'143. Sexual orientation in mortgage lending.To date, only two studies have addressed sexual orientationdiscrimination in mortgage lending. The first study (MichiganStudy) was conducted in 2007 by four of Michigan's Fair HousingCenters and included 120 pair-tests.149 Each test included twopairs: one posing as a heterosexual couple and the other posingas a same-sex couple with superior credentials (\"higher income,larger down payment, and better credit\").150 The study found dis-parate treatment in 32 (27 percent) of the 120 tests and concluded143 Id at *iv.144 Id at *6.145 See id at *vi (\"[H]eterosexual couples were favored over gay male couples in 15.9percent of tests and over lesbian couples in 15.6 percent of tests.\").146 See Friedman, et al, An Estimate of Housing Discrimination at *iv, vi-vii, 16-17.147 See Gneezy, List, and Price, Toward an Understanding at *16 (cited in note 123)(focusing on car dealerships in the Chicago area).148 See Friedman, et al, An Estimate of Housing Discrimination at vii (cited in note142) ('The study measured the response of housing providers regarding the sexual orien-tation of couples and did not examine other characteristics.\"); Gneezy, List, and Price,Toward an Understanding at *17 (cited in note 123).149 For an explanation of the methodology and its limitations, see Pair Testing andthe Housing Discrimination Studies (cited in note 133) ('Much of the research into housingdiscrimination.., relies on paired testing, a methodology in which two testers assume therole of applicants . . . who differ only in terms of the characteristic being tested for dis-crimination, such as race.\").150 Michigan Study at *3 (cited in note 16).[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 33that discrimination against same-sex couples is widespread.151The Michigan Study's conclusion, however, suffers from a numberof limitations. To begin with, the study focused on only one state:Michigan.152 The sample size was also small: a total of 120 pairedtests.15 3 Third, the study focused on three markets, of which only36 (or 30 percent) of the 120 tests were dedicated to discrimina-tion in \"home financing.\"'154 Moreover, home financing exhibitedthe least amount of discrimination: 20 percent compared to rental(33 percent) and homes sales (25 percent).155 Fourth, the studywas conducted in 2007, five years before the enactment of theEqual Access Rule. At that time, discrimination on the basis ofsexual orientation was allowed with respect to all types of mort-gages, including FHA loans. Therefore, the study could not esti-mate the effectiveness of the Equal Access Rule.The second study, conducted concurrently with ours, made anumber of important findings.156 First, based on a national sampleof 20 percent of HMDA data from 1990 to 2015, it found that,\"compared to otherwise similar loan applicants,\" the gross ap-proval rate for same-sex couples is 3 percent lower.157 Merging theHMDA sample with Fannie Mae Performance Data revealed thatsame-sex couples whose applications were accepted were chargedhigher interests expenses at a magnitude of 0.02 to 0.2 percent.158At the same time, the authors found no evidence that same-sexcouples had a higher default risk.159 Professors Lei Gao and HuaSun's study makes an important contribution. But it is differentfrom our study in a number of important respects, which do notallow it to answer the questions we investigate here. First, Gaoand Sun's study ignores the legal landscape and assumes thatsexual orientation discrimination is not prohibited. Specifically,it ignores the fact that twenty-three states now prohibit sexualorientation discrimination in mortgage lending and that, evenwithin states that do not prohibit the practice, some localities do.As a result, Gao and Sun did not and could not test the impact of151 Id at *9-10.152 Id.153 Id at *9.154 Michigan Study at *9 (cited in note 16).155 Id at *11.156 See generally Gao and Sun, The Rainbow of Credit (cited in note 17).157 Id at *4.

For this reason, thesestudies treated all same-sex couples, regardless of their sex(male/female) or race (black/white), as one homogeneous group.160This design did not allow the authors to test how the interactionbetween sex and race influences the discriminatory practicesidentified.161 Nor could the studies identify the effect of local ordi-nances162 or determine whether and how \"differences between theways lesbians and gay men are treated\" impacted the findings.163Sun and Gao's failure to distinguish between same-sex male cou-ples and same-sex female couples may also explain the low levelof discrimination found in their study-only 3 percent in theHMDA data.164 Our study suggests that same-sex female couplesare treated at least as favorably (and in some cases more favora-bly) as heterosexual couples, which implies that the actual rate ofsexual orientation discrimination against same-sex male couplesis in fact higher.165160 In the Michigan Study, like in other experiments, in each of the paired tests, thecouples posing as same-sex couples and heterosexual couples were always of the samerace. See Michigan Study at *3 (cited in note 16). Of these couples, the vast majority-113(or 94 percent)--were white, five were black, and two were inter-racial. See id at *10. Gaoand Sun controlled for race in their study but did not explore its interaction with sexualorientation in this context. See generally Gao and Sun, The Rainbow of Credit (cited innote 17).161 See Michigan Study at *9, 11 (cited in note 16) (admitting that \"[m]ore testing isneeded to see how the race and sex of testers [that is, of applicants] are influencing factorsin some housing markets\").162 See id at *9 (\"It is unclear whether [levels of discrimination found across the statediverged widely] due to differences in... the presence of local ordinances protecting sexualorientation.\"). Although inconclusive, the Michigan Study reported that there was less ev-idence of discrimination in areas with such local ordinances (22 percent compared to 30percent in areas without ordinances). See id at *16.163 Id at *9. The Swedish, Canadian, and HUD studies also suffer from this limitation.See generally Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 76 Economica 588 (cited in note 14).164 Gao and Sun, The Rainbow of Credit at *4 (cited in note 17).165 See notes 211-12 and accompanying text.2019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 35II. THE DESIGN, DATA, AND FINDINGSA. The DesignOur study is the first attempt to fill the gap and shed light onthe very issues that the Michigan Study identified as importantbut left unanswered. As this Part explains, unlike the field exper-iments, we study sexual orientation discrimination in all states,using a large number of observations (over five million) and fo-cusing solely on mortgage lending. Importantly, our study is thefirst to try to investigate how race and sex impact discriminationagainst same-sex applicants. Our data suggests that race is a crit-ical factor, that lesbians and gay men are treated differently, andthat state laws may have a real effect on discrimination againstthe LGB community.Our study builds on the prior literature in a variety of ways.As Part 11.B explains, based on the critiques of the use ofindividual-level data, we construct a model that remedies some ofthe problems identified in prior studies. Our model allows us tolook at the individual effects of potential mortgage discrimina-tion. It also takes into account the fact that different minoritygroups may self-select into neighborhoods and into mortgage ap-plications that have a higher risk of default.1. Risk considerations.We take a number of steps to ensure we do not mistake legit-imate risk considerations (including proxies that lenders may useto assess the risk of default, such as income or geographic effects)for discrimination. First, and exactly because of the concern thatdifferent applicants may carry different levels of risk, we focusedonly on FHA loans. Applicants for these loans must meet certainpredetermined criteria.166 Importantly, for applicants who metthe criteria, income and credit scores are less important. In theeyes of the lender, these FHA loans carry the same level of riskbecause each loan is insured by the federal government.167 This is166 These include the standards promulgated by the CFPB under the Ability-to-Repayand Qualified Mortgage Standards under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FedReg 35430, 35438-39 (2013), 12 CFR Part 1026, the FHA loan requirements discussed athttp://www.fhahandbook.com (visited December 17, 2018), and additional requirementsset by lenders and investors (known as \"overlays\").167 See notes 202-03 and accompanying text.The University of Chicago Law Review [86:1not to say that FHA loans are risk-free. A high delinquency rate'can translate into high servicing costs,169 costly regulatory re-view,170 and sanctions.171 It may also trigger indemnification re-quirements172 and can result in severe judgments17 and reputa-tional harm.174 However, there is nothing to suggest that lendersbelieve that same-sex borrowers are more likely to default thanother borrowers.1 75168 The \"serious delinquency rate[ ],\" defined as the \"sum of 90-day delinquencies plusin-foreclosures and in-bankruptcies,\" has been steadily reduced in recent years from 15.78percent in 2007 to 0.05 percent in 2017. See FHA Single Family Loan Performance Trends*2 (Department of Housing and Urban Development, Feb 2017), archived athttp://perma.cc/B24F-Y6PU.169 See Laurie S. Goodman, Quantifying the Tightness of Mortgage Credit andAssessing Policy Actions, 37 BC J L & Soc Just 235, 246 (2017) (reporting that in 2015 theannual cost of servicing performing loans was $181 compared to $2,386 for nonperformingloans).170 See 12 USC § 1708(c)(3); 24 CFR § 25.2 ('The Board has the authority to take anyadministrative action against mortgagees and lenders.\"); 24 CFR § 25.5 (giving the boardthe power to issue \"a letter of reprimand, probation, suspension, or withdrawal; or enterinto a settlement agreement.\").171 HUD's Mortgagee Review Board (MRB) \"is empowered to initiate the issuance ofa letter of reprimand, the probation, suspension or withdrawal of any mortgagee found tobe engaging in activities in violation of [FHA] requirements or the nondiscrimination re-quirements of the [ECOA], the [FH Act], or Executive Order 11063.\" 12 USC § 1708(c)(1).See also 24 CFR § 25.5 (detailing the effect of these administrative actions). The MRB isalso authorized \"to impose civil money penalties upon mortgagees and lenders.\" See 24CFR § 25.2(b)(2); 24 CFR § 30.15; 24 CFR § 30.35(b)-(c)(1) (\"Each day that a violationcontinues shall constitute a separate violation\" for which \"[t]he maximum penalty is$9,819 . . . up to a limit of $1,963,870 for all violations committed during any one-yearperiod.\").172 See Bernadette Kogler, Ann Schnare, and Tim Willis, Lender Perspectives onFHA's Declining Market Share *25 (Research Institute for Housing America, Aug 2006),archived at http://perma.cc/5DCV-RE5H (explaining that HUD can \"require a lender to'indemnify' the department\" when the \"insured loan [ ] was not originated in compliancewith FHA guidelines,\" and reporting that \"interviews revealed that HUD indemnificationsresult from comparatively minor documentation deficiencies that are not necessarily re-lated to a borrower's ability or willingness to repay\").173 A major source of concern for lenders is the False Claims Act (FCA), Pub L No 97-258, 96 Stat 978 (1982), codified as amended at 31 USC § 3729 et seq. The FCA allows thegovernment to recover from those who knowingly make a false record or submit a fraudu-lent claim three times the damages sustained by the government. See 31 USC § 3729(a)(1).Because FHA lenders must certify their compliance with HUD's rules, they are exposed toFCA litigation for errors committed during the origination phase. See Goodman, 37 BC JL & Soc Just at 245 (cited in note 169) (arguing that \"the big issue for FHA servicers isthe presence of the False Claims Act\" and noting that, in 2016, settlements with lendersfor FCA violations were close to $5 billion).174 See Kolger, Schnare, and Willis, Lender Perspectives at *24-25 (cited in note 172)(reporting that, in a study completed by sixty-one lending institutions, negative publicitywas \"cited as a moderate or minimal risk by most respondents\").175 In fact, there is some evidence to the contrary. See, for example, The LGBTFinancialExperience: 2012-2013 Prudential Research Study *10 (Prudential, 2013), archived at2019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 37Second, as we explain in the methodology section, whileHMDA data is limited, we do have and control for the applicant'sincome. That is, in addition to other controls, we compare loans ofapplicants with the same level of income.Finally, we recognize that the neighborhood of the home mayactually just be a proxy for bad credit (that is, bad economic neigh-borhoods generally attract applicants with bad credit). To controlfor a \"neighborhood effect,\" we include county-by-bank fixed ef-fects, which controls for any differences across neighborhoods andbanks. We are looking at how different compositions of race andgender affect loan acceptance within the same neighborhood bythe same bank.176 Moreover, while we do not have the credit scoreof the applicant, we do know if the loan got denied because of apoor credit score. Thus, while we do not know the intimate detailsof an applicant's credit history, we do know and control for thoseapplicants with bad enough credit to disqualify them for an FHAloan. As we explain further below, our empirical design allows usto compare loans of similarly situated applicants (same applicantincome, same loan amount, same loan purpose, same risk to thelender, etc.). This design--comparing loan acceptance rateswithin the same county by the same banks with multiple con-trols-has an important benefit. It offsets the concern that whathttp://perma.cc/RU4W-6MZH (\"The LGBT community has a higher median income com-pared to the general population\" and a \"high discretionary income, with 40% of gay menand 25% of lesbians spending more than $500 a month on discretionary items.\"). See alsoGao and Sun, The Rainbow of Credit at *24 (cited in note 17) (concluding that \"same-sexstatus exhibits no greater risk of default,\" that \"there is no evidence that same-sex bor-rowers are riskier for lenders, and [that some findings] suggest that it may be the oppo-site\"). Moreover, Gao and Sun find that \"HMDA estimation without extensive controls onborrower's characteristics [such as creditworthiness] seems to provide a conservative lowerbound on the magnitude of lending discrimination to same-sex borrowers.\" Id at *4 (em-phasis added).176 One possible concern could be that county data is not granulated enough to capturethe self-selection dynamic that may take place in certain neighborhoods within the samecounty. The reason is that some counties have neighborhoods that vary dramatically interms of their default risk. Thus, if same-sex couples are more likely to take a risk on beingan early entrant into a transitioning neighborhood, they may pose a higher risk to thelender, but this may not show in county-level data. Here it is important to note that, whileour main results are reported using bank-by-county fixed effects, the results are insensi-tive to using census tract-by-bank fixed effects, which can address such potential selec-tion effects. We also address this concern (although for a different purpose) by comparingmortgages within counties in other regions in the United States-particularly in ruralcounties. In these regions, the concern that there is unobserved variation in risk due toself-selection within county is mitigated. We find that the results hold when looking ex-clusively at rural counties. See note 232 and accompanying text.The University of Chicago Law Reviewwe measure is actually just a proxy for some other neighborhood-level characteristic.2. The proportion of same-sex gay co-applicants in thedata.Our design is still disadvantaged by a key element of sexualorientation discrimination. Other types of discrimination (for ex-ample, racial or gender) are typically based on characteristicsthat are easily observed by both the researcher and the lender. Bycontrast, sexual orientation is not a salient characteristic that thelender, much less the researcher, can necessarily observe. As aresult, we do not and cannot directly observe applicants' sexualorientation. While initially this may seem like a fatal flaw in ouranalysis, it is important to remember that the loan officer alsodoes not directly observe sexual orientation. The loan officer canonly infer sexual orientation based on observed characteristics(such as the applicant's style of dress, behavior, etc.) and the per-ceived relationship between the applicant and co-applicant. Whilewe do not (and cannot) observe sexual orientation, we do observeone important characteristic: whether the applicant is accompa-nied by a same-sex co-applicant. This is an important character-istic that loan officers observe.We recognize that this is not a perfect proxy for the appli-cant's actual sexual orientation. Indeed, co-applicants can be fam-ily members (for example, father and son) or friends, to give a fewexamples. However, there is strong theoretical and empirical ev-idence that our estimates do actually measure sexual orienta-tion-based discrimination despite our inability to directly distin-guish between same-sex homosexual co-applicants and same-sexheterosexual co-applicants.a) Theoretical explanations. First, it is important to remem-ber that the applicant's true sexual orientation is irrelevant. Dis-crimination is not based on the actual sexual orientation of theapplicant but rather on the applicant's perceived sexual orienta-tion. Discrimination is the result of what the loan officer believesto be true. By using same-sex co-applicants as a proxy for per-ceived sexual orientation, we are not only following in the foot-steps of other researchers;177 we are also following the legal test177 See, for example, Joshua J. Miller and Kevin A. Park, Same-Sex Marriage Lawsand Demand for Mortgage Credit *8, 20 (Department of Housing and Urban Development[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 39established in Price Waterhouse. This test focuses on the plain-tiffs \"appearance,\" behavior,\" and \"mannerisms,\" as they wereperceived by the loan officer.178Moreover, our findings, if anything, are a conservative meas-ure of the level of discrimination. The fact that we cannot distin-guish between (a) same-sex heterosexual co-applicants and(b) same-sex gay co-applicants actually makes our resultsstronger. In other words, we show that, if the data includes notjust gay co-applicants but also heterosexual co-applicants, thenthe true level of discrimination is actually higher than we report.The reason is related to the first point: the loan officer cannotobserve the co-applicants' true sexual orientation. In some cases,the loan officer may have information that we cannot observe: forexample, whether the same sex co-applicants are a father andson. In other cases, the loan officer may believe that the same sexco-applicants are a gay couple even if they are not. The concern,therefore, is that there are essentially two types of same-sex ap-plications: (a) those applications in which the co-applicants areclearly related, such as a father/son pairing (Group 1), and aretherefore not (or less likely to be) perceived179 as gay individuals,and (b) the rest of the same-sex applications, in which the rela-tionship between the applicant and co-applicant is ambiguous tothe lender (Group 2). As researchers, we cannot distinguish be-tween Group 1 and Group 2. But if (i) the loan officer has a tastefor discrimination and has additional information on the natureof the relationship either through last name or physical appear-ance (for example, Group 1 looks like a father and son versusGroup 2, in which it is unclear), and (ii) the loan officer actuallydiscriminates only against Group 2, then all that does is under-state the magnitude of the effect of discrimination. In otherwords, the inability to distinguish between the two groups, ifanything, biases our results toward zero.To illustrate this point, consider the following example. Sup-pose the bigoted loan officer does not discriminate againstGroup 1 members because he has knowledge that is not observa-ble to us as researchers. In such a case, members of Group 1 areWorking Paper No HF-020, Feb 2016), archived at http://perma.cc/9PFY-FM8R (estimat-ing, based on the reported sex of co-applicants, that states that passed same-sex marriagelaws experienced an 8 to 13 percent increase in mortgage applications).178 See notes 39-44 and accompanying text.179 A parent and child may both be gay individuals or may be perceived as such by theloan officer. It could also be that one of them is a gay individual (that is, the parent or thechild may be a gay individual).The University of Chicago Law Review0 percent more/less likely to have the loan approved (that is, theywill be treated the same as the white heterosexual benchmark).Now, because the loan officer is bigoted and does like to discrimi-nate against Group 2 members (perceived gay co-applicants), thoseloans are, say, 12 percent less likely to get accepted. The \"true\"level of discrimination is 12 percent. However, in our analysis, wenecessarily are forced to clump Group 1 and Group 2 loans to-gether. Our resulting estimates average the effect of Group 1 andGroup 2, which in this hypothetical would result in an overall ef-fect of loans 6 percent ([0+12]/2) less likely to be approved. Thus,if anything, this ambiguity only understates the level of discrim-ination (\"true\" level of 12 percent compared to the estimated effectof 6 percent) but does not invalidate our estimates.b) Empirical evidence. We further this claim empirically inthree ways. First, we track the rate of same-sex loan applicationsin states and local jurisdictions that passed laws prohibiting dis-crimination on the basis of sexual orientation.FIGURE 2: CHANGE IN SAME-SEX LOAN APPLICATIONS BEFOREAND AFTER THE PASSAGE OF ANTIDISCRIMINATION LAWS00po.2 iYears Before/AfterFigure 2 above tracks the proportion of same-sex loan appli-cations over time, centered on the year the law passed (becausenot all laws are passed in the same year). The horizontal axismeasures time in years before and after the law is passed, andthe vertical axis measures the proportion of same-sex loans. As[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 41Figure 2 demonstrates, there is a marked increase in same-sexloans after the law passes that persists through the end of ourdata range. Under the assumption that the Group 1 (perceivedheterosexual co-applicants, such as parent-child) same-sex loanswill not be affected by changes in anti-sexual orientation discrim-ination laws, Figure 2 suggests that laws are specifically openingthe door for more Group 2 (perceived gay co-applicants) loans.Figure 2 is also consistent with previous research showingthat same-sex loan applications increased after the decision inObergefell v Hodges.iso This study, conducted by HUD in 2016, ex-ploited the \"variation across states prior to the Supreme Courtdecision to investigate the effect of marriage laws on demand formortgage credit. 181 By using the same methodology that we do-looking at the reported sex of co-applicants-it concluded thatstates that passed same-sex marriage laws \"experienced [an] 8 to13 percent increase in same-sex mortgage applications.\"182FIGURE 3: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SIZE OF THE LGBTCOMMUNITY AND THE PROPORTION OF SAME-SEX LOANS BYSTATEls00C1180 135 S Ct 2584 (2015). See generally Miller and Park, Same-Sex Marriage Laws(cited in note 177).181 Miller and Park, Same-Sex Marriage Laws at *1 (cited in note 177).182 Id at *2.183 The vertical axis measures proportions for each series separated on the horizontalaxis into each state and the District of Columbia.The University of Chicago Law ReviewSecond, Figure 3 shows that the number of loan applicationswith two co-applicants of the same sex correlates to the size of theLGBT community. This suggests that many of the same-sex loanapplications in our dataset were submitted by gay or lesbian cou-ples rather than other same-sex co-applicants, such as roommatesor relatives of the same sex. In Figure 3, we compare the propor-tion of same-sex loans per state-the top line-to the actual pro-portion of individuals in the state that consider themselves partof the LGBT community-the lower line.184 Both lines trend to-gether, with a correlation coefficient of 0.71, suggesting a strongand robust correlation. Essentially, in states with a larger LGBTcommunity, more same-sex applications are filed. Figure 3 there-fore suggests that most of the same-sex applications we measureare, in fact, home loan applications filed by gay co-applicants.Part II.C reports the result of a third robustness test leading tothe same conclusion.B. The Model1. The data and methodology.Our study relies on three datasets. The first two are proprie-tary and include state- and local-level protection against antidis-crimination practices in mortgage lending.185 The third has pub-licly available data on home mortgages reported by financialinstitutions pursuant to the HMDA. We study every home loanapplication in the United States reported under the HMDA be-184 Data on the LGBT community comes from Same-Sex Couple and LGBTDemographic Data Interactive (The Williams Institute, UCLA School of Law, May 2016),archived at http://perma.cc/A9T7-LXPM.185 All state-level fair housing laws were collected from Westlaw. For states that hadsexual orientation protection, we recorded the date the statute was passed or the relevantsection was added and the date it became effective. Assembling a database that includesall local and county ordinances was more challenging. First, no one source compiles alllocal laws. In addition, we found that some localities maintain extensive histories, whileothers do not. To address these issues, we reviewed a number of leading databases, includ-ing Municode, Code Publishing, American Legal Publishing, General Code Corporation,Qcode, Coded Systems, and Conway Greene. We then compared the results to earlier listsby other organizations, such as the Human Rights Campaign, and attempted to track thelegislative history-particularly the enactment and effective dates-for ordinances withsexual orientation protection.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 43tween the years 2010 and 2015-about five million observa-tions.186 To keep the risk of the loan constant, we restrict the da-taset to include only applications made for FHA loans in whichthe applicant has a co-applicant.187Our outcome of interest is an indicator variable signifyingwhether or not the loan was accepted. The variable equals 1 if theloan was accepted and 0 if the loan was rejected.188 In addition tothe gender and racial makeup of the applicant and co-applicant,we are able to control for a myriad of factors that influence theprobability of whether a home loan is accepted. These include theapplicant's income, loan amount, property type,189 loan purpose,190whether or not the home will be owner occupied, whether or notthe applicant had been preapproved, the applicant's ethnicity,and the reason for denial, if any. We include each of these varia-bles in each model to account for any observable factor that mayinfluence the bank's decision to accept or deny the loan.To account for any national, unobserved trends in the data,we also include in each model year-fixed effects. These dummyvariables allow us to control for changes in home loan trends thatare common across all loans in a given year.19'Additionally, we control for variation between differentbanks in the same county and different branches of the same bankin different counties. To see why, suppose that Bank I and Bank IIare large national banks with branches in numerous counties inthe United States. Bank I may have different lending practicesthan Bank II. Similarly, a branch of Bank I in one county mayhave different lending practices than a branch of Bank I in a dif-ferent county. To control for these two forms of variation (inter-bank and intrabank), we create a dummy variable for each bankin each county. That is, we create a set of dummy variables forBank I for each county in each state, and we do the same for allthe other banks. These bank-by-county fixed effects absorb all186 We chose these years in an attempt to avoid the housing market crash and aftermath.187 A similar method is employed in a study of FHA loans that did not require co-applicants by Greg Buchak and Adam Jorring, Does Competition Reduce RacialDiscrimination in Lending? *7 (unpublished research paper, The University of Chicago,2016), archived at http://perma.cc/YB9F-BHM6.188 This measurement of loan application success is a common measure in the dis-crimination literature. See, for example, id at *11.1s9 There are three property types: single family, multifamily, and manufacturinghousing.190 The \"loan purpose\" can be home purchase, home improvement, or home refinancing.191 For instance, the changing landscape of home mortgages in the United States fol-lowing the housing market collapse would be accounted for with year-fixed effects.The University of Chicago Law Reviewcrossbank and crosscounty differences. All the variation that re-mains is the differences in lending practices within banks in thesame county. Put differently, including these fixed effects allowsus to look at how the same bank in the same county treats differ-ent applications. These variables allow us to exploit the within-bank and within-county variation. 192Discrimination is a comparative term. Accordingly, our com-parison group is the white male/white female pair-the most com-mon combination in the dataset. Our independent variables are aset of all the remaining fifteen possible gender and race combina-tions between a primary applicant and a co-applicant. We thushave a separate dummy variable for each of the following combi-nations: (1) white male/black male, (2) white male/white male,(3) black male/black male, (4) black male/white male, (5) whitefemale/black male, (6) white female/white male, (7) blackfemale/black male, (8) black female/white male, (9) whitefemale/black female, (10) white female/white female, (11) blackfemale/black female, (12) black female/white female, (13) whitemale/black female, (14) black male/black female, (15) blackmale/white female.Formally, Equation 1 estimates the following linear probabil-ity model:192 With the HMDA dataset, we are able to drill down to a geographical evel of gran-ularity finer than county and go all the way down to census tract, which typically consistsof neighborhoods within a county with a population of around four thousand. For compu-tational reasons, we feel county-by-bank effects are more appropriate. One major empiri-cal decision to balance in this Article is the tradeoff between very precise data and allowingfor enough identifying variation. For instance, if we compared the same banks within astate, that would provide plenty of observations nested within each fixed effect, but it mayoversimplify the mortgage process because geographic and economic conditions varywildly within a state. On the other hand, drilling down to the neighborhood level providesthe best comparison, but functionally, the analysis is weakened by the lack of diversity inapplication types. Put differently, if we compare Bank A in State 1, there will be lots ofapplications to look at, but they will be for homes in potentially very different neighbor-hoods. On the other hand, if we look only in the same neighborhoods, there is a real possi-bility that a bank may not cover all fifteen types of race/gender combinations we analyzein this study. We believe that county-by-bank effects best balance the need for a tightcomparison window while keeping a critical mass of observations in each window. Themain results are, however, completely unchanged if we instead include census tract-by-bank effects.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 45Libcy = a0 + blbmbmibcy + b2bmwmibcy + b3wmbmibcy +b4wmwmibcy + bSbmbfibcy + b6bfbfibcy + b7bfwfibcy +bswmbfibcy + bgwfbfibcy + blobmwfibcy + bllbfbmibcy +bl 2bfwmibcy + b13wfwfibcy + bl 4wfwmibcy + blswfbmibcy +Xibcy + Ty + Pbc + eibcyWhere Libcy represents whether or not loan application i was ac-cepted at bank b in county c in year y.

Accordingly, the coefficient bk can be interpretedas the percentage point change in the probability of loan ac-ceptance. The omitted group is a white male applicant with awhite female co-applicant.2. Model validity.HMDA data is rich and provides the most complete coverageof the loan application process.194 Still, there are many concernsthat need to be addressed.a) Linear probability modeling. A restricted dependent vari-able, such as a binary outcome of whether or not a loan was ac-cepted, violates the assumptions of ordinary least squares esti-mation (OLS), in part because the dependent variable is notcontinuous but also because the standard errors are misesti-mated. Additionally, it is possible for a linear probability model(OLS applied to a binary outcome variable) to produce model es-timates that yield a nonsensical predicted probability that isgreater than one. Alternative estimation techniques such as logitand probit models correct for this by constraining the model to bebound between zero and one. These models, however, come withtheir own set of assumptions and perform equally as poorly, if notworse, than linear probability models.195In the context of this Article, we are able to alleviate the typ-ical concerns associated with linear probability modeling. First,193 See notes 188-90 and accompanying text.194 See Miller and Park, Same-Sex Marriage Laws at *6 (cited in note 177).195 See generally William Greene, The Behaviour of the Maximum Likelihood Estimatorof Limited Dependent Variable Models in the Presence of Fixed Effects, 7 Econometrics J98 (2004).The University of Chicago Law Reviewwe adjust for bias in the estimation of the standard errors by clus-tering the standard errors in each model at the state level. Se-cond, in our dataset, 47 percent of the loans we analyze were ac-cepted. Thus, the oft-voiced critique that linear probabilitymodels perform poorly when there are very few events (that is, noloans were accepted) or very few nonevents (in other words, al-most all loans are accepted) is not an issue.196 Lastly, we aremostly interested in calculating marginal effects for each of thepair combinations and less concerned about making predictionsor forecasts of the full model. Accordingly, the concern that a lin-ear probability model could produce predictions of a probabilitygreater (or less) than one is not an issue. We turn to review otherpotential pitfalls discussed in the home mortgage literature,which are not specific to Equation 1.b) Demographics as an endogenous instrument for economicconditions. Many early studies of home mortgage discriminationpointed to the possibility of race, or any other demographic, asnothing more than a proxy for another, unobserved variable.197For instance, if blacks disproportionally apply for home loans inmore economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, lenders may bemore likely to deny the loan application. The reason is not due toracial discrimination but rather due to the perceived high risk ofextending a loan to applicants residing in such neighborhoods. Aswe previously mention, economists often refer to this type of dis-crimination as statistical discrimination: discrimination that isbased on a factor other than a demographic characteristic.Our study finds more conclusive evidence that the motivationfor discrimination is taste-based, or bigotry, than any previouseconometric study. The reason is that, unlike with race, lendersare less likely to rely on perceived sexual orientation as a proxyfor increased risk.198 Moreover, given the sheer magnitude of thedataset HMDA offers, we are able to control for lender-by-countyfixed effects. That is, our analysis compares loan applications con-sidered by the same lender from those who reside in the samecounty, which by definition has the same risk to the lender (they196 See Gary King and Langche Zeng, Logistic Regression in Rare Events Data, 9Political Analysis 137, 150 (2001).197 For a defense of such studies, see generally James H.

Thereis also some concern that there are factors that the lenders areable to observe and include in a risk assessment of the loan appli-cation that we, as researchers, are not able to observe in the data.The most glaring example is credit scores, which are probably thesingle strongest indicator of risk and are a factor observed by thelender.201 Despite its richness, HMDA does not include creditscores. However, as Part II.A.1 explains above, our research de-sign allows us to address and mitigate this concern in a myriad ofways, one of which is by focusing solely on FHA loans.2°2 Theunique feature of these loans is that they carry the same low levelof risk to the lender. An applicant approved for an FHA loan pays199 For computation reasons, we include county-by-bank fixed effects. Our results areinsensitive to the inclusion of census tract-by-bank fixed effects, which is an even moredirect measure of neighborhood effects.200 We add a word of caution. Although our findings suggest that the discriminationis motivated by bigotry, it is important to note that other forces may be in play that mayexplain the results. First, the discrimination observed may be the result of \"carried-over\"discrimination-that is, discrimination that occurred prior to the application process, andwhat we observe in the mortgage market is just a downstream consequence of previousdiscrimination. For example, if members of the LGB community are discriminated againstin labor markets and consequently switch jobs more often than other groups, they may beless likely to be approved for FHA loans, which require that applicants hold a steady two-year income. In this regard, we are able to control for loans that were denied due to em-ployment history, so any observed discriminatory effect is occurring independent of up-stream employment discrimination. LGB individuals may also find it harder to meet theFHA documentation requirement. One recent study reports that 57 percent of LGBTQindividuals experienced discrimination across many areas of life.\" See Discrimination inAmerica: Experiences and Views of LGBTQ Americans *2 (NPR, Nov 2017), archived athttp://perma.cc/FV28-9GZJ. Another reports that \"34% of LGBT people who experienceddiscrimination in the past year avoided public places.., and 18% avoided doctors' offices.\"Movement Advancement Project, LGBT Policy Spotlight: Public AccommodationsNondiscrimination Laws *2 (IAP, 2018), archived at http://perma.cc/EV8H-FMM5. Com-bined, these studies suggest that members of the LGBT community are less likely to pro-duce necessary documents. Similar to employment history, we are able to control for ap-plications that were denied due to improper documentation. Moreover, the observeddiscrimination may be, at least in part, the product of other agents. For example, the dis-crimination may be due to disparate treatment by bigoted appraisers who are required toassess the purchased property. However, taken together, it is more likely that discrimina-tion takes place at the point of sale-that is, with the loan officer.201 See note 168.202 For a recent article employing a similar strategy, see generally Buchak andJorring, Does Competition Reduce Racial Discrimination? (cited in note 187).The University of Chicago Law Reviewan FHA insurance premium. In case of a default, the lender re-coups the losses from the government.203 As a result, every FHAloan bears the same risk and expected return to the lender re-gardless of the demographic characteristics of the applicant. Ac-cordingly, it is unlikely that disparate treatment in FHA loan de-nial can be traced to an unobserved (to the researcher) measureof risk.C.

Column (2) reports the results with the controls men-tioned previously.205 In both models, the corrected standard errorsclustered at the state level are in parentheses. Each coefficientcan be interpreted as the percentage point increase (if positive) ordecrease (if negative) in the likelihood of a loan to be accepted foreach applicant/co-applicant pair relative to a white male/whitefemale applicant pair. For instance, from Column (2) in Table 2,a pair consisting of a white male applicant and a black male co-applicant is 4.3 percentage points less likely to have a loan ac-cepted as a white male/white female pair asking for the same loanamount with the same income from the same lender in the samecounty. This means that, if a white male/black male pair has a 45percent chance of having a loan application accepted, we wouldexpect a white male/white female pair to have a 49.3 percentchance of approval. This is so despite the fact that both pairs re-quested the same amount for the same purpose with the same in-come from the same lender in the same county and bear the samelevel of risk to the lender.205 See notes 188-91 and accompanying text.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 51FIGURE 4: EFFECT OF GENDER AND RACIAL COMPOSITION ON CO-APPLICANT LOAN ACCEPTANCE2°6LOtoCFigure 4 organizes the results in Table 2 from most negativeto most positive and includes bands that represent 90 percent con-fidence intervals. To interpret Figure 4, focus first on the pointsat the center of the intervals. A point that lies below the zero linesuggests the race/gender pairing is less likely to have a loan ac-cepted, and a point above the line suggests the acceptance is morelikely. Now focus on the intervals. If an interval intersects withthe zero line on the horizontal axis, the estimated effect is notstatistically significant at the 10 percent level.To test once again whether the results are driven by same-sex gay co-applicants (rather than by same-sex heterosexual206 This figure displays graphically the empirical results from Column (2) in Table 2.The marginal effect for each gender and race combination is measured on the vertical axis,and each combination of race and gender is measured on the horizontal axis. The firstletter in each horizontal axis label represents the race of the applicant, the second lettersignifies the gender, the third letter represents the race of the co-applicant, and the lastletter represents the gender of the co-applicant. For example, \"bmbm\" stands for a blackmale applicant with a black male co-applicant. In this specification and all other specifi-cations, we make no assumption about the symmetry of an applicant and co-applicant.That is, there might be reason to believe wmbm may be treated differently from the sym-metric pairing, bmwm, so we treat each as different. This allows us to check if there is a\"primary applicant\" or \"secondary applicant\" effect.The University of Chicago Law Reviewparent-child co-applicants),27 we remove from the dataset any ap-plicant or co-applicant that reports more than one race. The ra-tionale is that keeping only \"single-race\" applicants would (likely)exclude from the data parent-and-child co-applicants. The reasonis that it is unlikely that a co-applicant who reports one race (forexample, black) will be the parent of the applicant with only onedifferent race (for example, white). We report the results of thisregression graphically in Figure 5 below. Figure 5 shows that,when the sample is restricted to the types of same-sex loans thatare more likely representative of actual gay couples (Group 2208),the results hold and in some cases are slightly stronger.FIGURE 5: EFFECT OF GENDER AND RACIAL COMPOSITION ONAPPLICATION SUCCESS WHEN THE LOANS ARE MORE LIKELY TOBE SUBMITTED BY GAY COUPLESbmbmbmwmwmbmwmwmbmbfbfbfbfwfwmbfbmwfbfbmwfbfbfwmwfwfwfwmwfbm0 -fI.00-The empirical evidence suggests that a large portion of thesame-sex loan applications are actually loans submitted by gay207 Part II.A.2 reports two additional robustness tests.

See note 179 and accompany-ing text.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 53couples. Moreover, the differences between the results thatFigures 4 and 5 report are also consistent with our theoreticalprediction in Part II.A that our results are a conservative meas-ure of discrimination and that the actual level of discriminationis higher than we observe.1. National patterns in discrimination.With this in mind, we turn to analyze the results. Figure 4provides strong evidence of systemic and widespread discrimina-tion against gay male couples. More specifically, Figure 4 showsthat any application with a pair of males is statistically less likelyto be approved relative to the same white heterosexual pair.Within the same-sex male pair groups, race plays a role. Althoughall same-sex male applications are less likely to be accepted,black-male pairs are the least likely to be approved (-7.5 per-centage points), followed by the interracial pairs of blackmale/white male (-6.8), white male/black male (-4.3) and whitemale pair (-2.5). Interestingly, the exact same pattern holds forfemale pairs. From the least to most likely to be approved areblack female pairs, followed by interracial black female/whitefemale and white female/black female pairs, and white femalepairs. In the case of same-sex pairs (that is, male/male andfemale/female pairs), the data reveals some evidence of a statis-tically significant \"primary applicant\" effect. The differences be-tween interracial pairs, however, are statistically indistinguish-able from one another.Our results shed new light on earlier studies of discrimina-tion. Previous research has suggested significant and persistentevidence of racial discrimination in mortgage lending. Recent es-timates suggest that black pairs are 7 percentage points lesslikely to have a loan accepted.209 The evidence we present heresuggests the possibility of a more nuanced story. While raceseems to play an important role in the probability of getting ahome loan, interracial applicants and even white male pair appli-cants are statistically less likely to get accepted. The fact thateven white male pairs are less likely to get a loan in a similarfashion to other same-sex male pairs is important for at least tworeasons. First, it is evidence of discrimination on the basis of sex-ual orientation that is consistent with the pair-studies literature.209 See Buchak and Jorring, Does Competition Reduce Racial Discrimination? at *14(cited in note 187).The University of Chicago Law ReviewSecond, the evidence of discrimination against white male pairsalleviates the concern that Figure 4 measures nothing more thanracial discrimination. Finally, even after we control for the gendercomposition of the same-sex pair applicants, we do find that, com-pared to the white heterosexual baseline, a pair consisting of ablack male and a black female is still statistically less likely tohave a home loan application accepted. The effect, however, isabout half as small as previous estimates.210Another interesting finding in our results is the lack of sym-metry of effect between perceived gay and perceived lesbian co-applicants. We find that every possible racial combination of malepairs is statistically disadvantaged when getting a loan applica-tion approved. By contrast, in every case, a female pair is eitherstatistically indistinguishable from the baseline group or actuallyhas a higher likelihood of getting the loan accepted. This result isactually consistent with much of the experimental literature onsexual orientation discrimination in housing2ll and coincides wellwith the growing body of literature about the social acceptabilityof lesbian, but not gay male, relationships.212It is important to remember that we do not observe the na-ture of the relationship between the co-applicants in the data.213However, unlike other salient bases for discrimination (such asrace), sexual orientation is much harder for the loan officer to ob-serve. In many cases, the loan officer does not know with certaintyeither the orientation of the applicants or their relationship. Inthe absence of a clear signal, the discriminatory loan officer (ei-ther overtly or inadvertently) likely uses the gender and race ofthe co-applicants as a proxy for sexual orientation. We, in effect,use the same proxy in this study. The proxy is admittedly imper-fect. Surely there are times that the bias, even an intentional one,210 See id (7 percentage points); Munnell, et al, 86 Am Econ Rev at 33 (cited in note126) (8.2 percentage points).211 See generally Friedman, et al, An Estimate of Housing Discrimination (cited innote 142) (finding a similar, but larger, effect for gay men compared to lesbian women);Lauster and Easterbrook, 58 Soc Probs at 389 (cited in note 14) (finding an even morepronounced discrimination against gay men).212 See, for example, Robert Anderson and Tina Fetner, Cohort Differences in Toleranceof Homosexuality: Attitudinal Change in Canada and the United States, 72 Pub OpinionQ, 311, 314 (2008); Gregory M. Herek and John P. Capitanio, Sex Differences in HowHeterosexuals Think about Lesbians and Gay Men: Evidence from Survey Context Effects,36 J Sex Rsrch 348, 357 (1999). See also Elmslie and Tebaldi, 28 J of Labor Rsrch at 441(cited in note 14) (a labor market study noting that \"[t]he bias against gay men is muchstronger than the bias toward lesbians\").213 See Part II.A.2 and notes 207-08 and accompanying text.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 55would be the result of a mistake. For instance, the loan officermay mistakenly believe that a pair of heterosexual male appli-cants is involved in a homosexual relationship. These heterosex-ual applicants may thus receive the same discriminatory treat-ment as if they were gay. In our eyes (and in the eyes of the law),this does not mean the analysis is flawed. All it means is thatdiscrimination is happening against gay applicants and appli-cants who are perceived to be gay. What could result, potentially,is actually \"overdiscrimination\"-that is, discrimination againstthe targeted group and, in addition, discrimination against otherswho are perceived as belonging to the targeted group.2. Regional patterns in discrimination.The results that Table 2 and Figure 4 report above compareloan applications to other loan applications from the same bankin the same county, in order to control for external variables, andthen aggregate the results for the entire country by race and gen-der pairings. There may be reason, however, to believe that dif-ferent regions in the United States or different types of banks dis-criminate differently. To control for this, we first divide the datainto four census regions, re-estimate Equation 1, and replicateTable 2 and Figure 4. Instead of looking at the effect of a genderand race applicant makeup of, say, black male/black male, we di-vide that single dummy variable into four variables that signifywhether the loan was filed by (a) a pair of black males in the West,(b) a pair of black males in the South, (c) a pair of black males inthe Midwest, or (d) a pair of black males in the Northeast.214 Wedo this for each of our fifteen gender and race indicator variablesof interest and include them all in the regression. What results isan estimate of the probability of loan acceptance for each groupby region. Those results are summarized in Table 3 and Figure 6below.214 For more on census regions, see Geographic Terms and Concepts-CensusDivisions and Census Regions (United States Census Bureau), archived athttp://perma.cc/S64H-9443.The University of Chicago Law Review [86:1TABLE 3: PROBABILITY OF LOAN ACCEPTANCE BY RACE, GENDER,AND REGION215Applicant Co-applicant I NortheastII. - + . ________ ~. ________ L ________Sample SizeR SquaredTable 3 and Figure 6 indicate that all regions in the UnitedStates exhibit the same pattern of discrimination we observe on215 Unlike in Table 2, each column in Table 3 reports results for the same regressionthat splits the effect of each race and gender pairing by region.

In each region, all four groups (male, female,black, and white applicants) are discriminated against based onperceived sexual orientation. In other words, all applications filedby same-sex pairs are less likely to be accepted compared to thewhite heterosexual pair. In certain circumstances, the negativeeffect is statistically insignificant, but it is still negative. For in-stance, in the Midwest, an application filed by an interracialsame-sex pair consisting of a white male and black male pair isstatistically indistinguishable from zero. By contrast, an applica-tion filed by other same-sex male pairs is statistically less likelyto get accepted by the same bank in the same county as the whiteheterosexual pair application. That same group of applicants-white male/black male-is also statistically insignificant in theWest, but again, each of the other three highlighted same-sexgroups are still statistically worse off. Interestingly, the data sug-gests that this interracial pair is discriminated against most inthe Northeast. In that region, applications from white male/blackmale pairs are 12.2 percentage points less likely to be approved.The result is not only the worst in magnitude but also the moststatistically significant (at the 99 percent level).The University of Chicago Law ReviewFIGURE 6: EFFECT OF GENDER AND RACIAL COMPOSITION ONCO-APPLICANT LOAN ACCEPTANCE BY REGION216Northeast Midwestot- TSouth Wes00anyed sigexa rietaion is Unidestaesdado isovngted resultsspecific geographic region.

Thus,while the magnitude of the effect varies slightly, the applicationof a pair consisting of two black males is no better positioned tobe accepted in, for example, Utah than in Oregon or Wisconsin(all else equal). One interesting exception is that Democraticstates are the least tolerant to the two groups of interracial malepairs. The results are not only substantially stronger in magni-tude-in the case of the black/white male pair, the chance to beapproved in a Democratic state is about half compared to that inRepublican states-but hey are also most statically significant.More broadly, Figure 7 demonstrates that these lending patternscannot be attributed simply to the mindset of a specific region ora certain political philosophy. These patterns of discriminationare widespread and can be observed in virtually every geopoliticalsegment of the United States.FIGURE 7: EFFECT OF GENDER AND RACIAL COMPOSITION ON CO-APPLICANT LOAN ACCEPTANCE BY POLITICAL PARTY LINES222Combined20Republican,-0 +1.iDemocrat*SwingT222 This Figure replicates the results that Figure 6 presents in every way except wheneach coefficient is split by party lines instead of region. Additionally, the main result fromFigure 2 is included in the top left quadrant by way of comparison.The University of Chicago Law ReviewOne last potential source of variation that may be driving theresults is not necessarily the makeup of the community but ratherthe lenders themselves. Though unlikely, given the within bank-county analysis we conduct in this study, there may be somethingabout the way large versus medium or smaller banks operate thatmay inform the results we present here. For example, one couldargue that larger banks are less likely to discriminate because,among other possible reasons, they may have better proceduresor higher exposure. To test this, we split out the data by the tenlargest banks in terms of loan applications received. These banksmake up about 40 percent of the loan applications in our database.We then compare the \"Top Ten\" banks to all banks in the smallest25 percent by loan applications handled and all other mediumbanks in between.223 The results, which Table 5 and Figure 8 pre-sent, suggest a very similar pattern.

The same pair is 9 percentage points less likely to get ac-cepted at all other banks. Also, the effect for applications filed byinterracial pairs consisting of white male and black male co-applicants is much smaller and statistically insignificant for bigbanks.3. Remedies for reversing trends of systematic andwidespread bias.The evidence we present here suggests a systematic and wide-spread bias against FHA loan applications filed by any male pair,regardless of race. It may be the case, though, that the reason forthese discriminatory patterns is more nuanced. For instance, it225 Both subfigures come from a single regression that Table 6 reports. This figurereads and interprets the same as each previous figure.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 65could be that the results are not an artifact of regional differencesin attitudes or political opinions but the lack of contact with theaffected group. Assuming this is true, what can be done to remedythe situation?a) The \"Contact Hypothesis.\" To understand the ContactHypothesis, suppose the average loan officer identifies as straightand has well-established biases against the LGB community-specifically, biases against gay men. Research shows that effortsto reduce such intergroup bias in a meaningful and enduring waydemand thorough and intense intervention over a long period.226One type of intervention that has had some reported effect in re-ducing intergroup bias is sustained contact with individuals ofthe affected group.227 The idea behind the prevailing (yet debated)Contact Hypothesis is that, under certain conditions, intergroupbias would decrease as individual contact between differentgroups' members increases.228Could it be that our results are being driven by a lack of sus-tained contact with the affected groups? We test this by compar-ing loan acceptance rates between urban and rural environments.Under the Contact Hypothesis, one would expect to observe lessdiscrimination in urban environments. Based simply on sheerpopulation numbers, it is likely that the average loan officer op-erating in an urban area has a higher chance of sustained contactwith gay men. We loosely define an environment as urban if itspopulation density is above average and as rural if its populationdensity is below average.229 Table 6 and Figure 9 below report theresults for each of the gender and race pair variations in theseenvironments.226 For a review of intergroup bias and attempts to decrease it, see Thomas F. Pettigrewand Linda R. Tropp, A Meta-analytic Test of Intergroup Contact Theory, 90 J Personality andSoc Psychology 751, 766-83 (2006).227 As an example, see generally Shana Levin, Colette van Laar, and Jim Sidanius, TheEffects of Ingroup and Outgroup Friendships on Ethnic Attitudes in College: A LongitudinalStudy, 6 Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 76 (2003) (finding that college studentsexposed to intergroup relationships were more likely to report having friends from thosegroups and less likely to display biased behaviors in subsequent college years).228 See David Broockman and Joshua Kalla, Durably Reducing Transphobia: A FieldExperiment on Door-to-Door Canvassing, 352 Science 220, 223 (2016).229 Consider Briggs Depew and Isaac D.

While the point esti-mates in Figure 9's two graphs vary slightly, the differences arenot significant, and each of the four disadvantaged male pairgroups232 is still less likely to get a loan approved in a statisticallysignificant way. Thus, if comparing rural to urban settings is areasonable proxy for association with gay men, it appears thatcontact alone may not reduce intergroup bias.b) State and local laws. As we explain earlier, discriminationbased on sexual orientation is not prohibited under federal law.233231 This Figure reports the regression results of Table 3. See Figure 2 for more detailson the construction and interpretation of this Table.232 The groups are (i) black male pairs (experiencing the most discrimination), fol-lowed by (ii) black male/white male pairs, then (iii) white male/black male pairs, and fi-nally (iv) white male pairs.233 The Equal Access Rule, which prohibits lenders of FHA loans from engaging inthis form of discrimination, is an administrative rule. As HUD explicitly admits, the Ruledoes not create a new right for aggrieved parties. See Equal Access Rule, 77 Fed Reg at5670-71 (cited in note 10).The University of Chicago Law ReviewIn light of federal inaction, twenty-three states and over four hun-dred localities passed laws expressly prohibiting discriminationbased on sexual orientation in lending.234 These local laws mayinfluence lenders' behaviors. The reason could be intrinsic. Ex-pressive law theorists, for example, argue that \"the mere exist-ence of [a] law helps to shape and define [people's] world views\"and increase compliance.235 Or the reason may be extrinsic. Forexample, it could be that local laws result in increased compliancedue to enforcement efforts or fear thereof. Alternatively, it couldbe that jurisdictions that adopt local antidiscrimination laws doso because they are already more accepting of gay applicants.Whatever the reason may be, it is clear that the minority ofstates and localities that adopted these laws were not selectedrandomly to do so. This is important because, hypothetically, thebest way to measure the efficacy of a law, policy, or any type ofpolicy intervention would have been to randomly assign the lawto half the states and localities and keep the remaining half as acontrol group. In this hypothetical, states and localities wouldhave no control over whether they got the law; thus, any differ-ence in the underlying characteristics between the states and lo-calities would be random. The reality, however, is that antidis-crimination laws are not randomly assigned to state and localjurisdictions. Similarly, states and localities that declined toadopt such protections did not randomly choose to refrain fromdoing so. This calls into question their validity as the comparisongroup and could bias the results.236 This bias would manifest if wesimply compared states with antidiscrimination laws to states234 See Part I.C.235 Yuval Feldman and Orly Lobel, The Incentives Matrix: The Comparative Effectivenessof Rewards, Liabilities, Duties, and Protections for Reporting Illegality, 88 Tex L Rev 1151,1184 (2010).236 As a hypothetical, imagine a variable called \"tolerance toward the LGB commu-nity.\" If this were a variable we could measure, we might find that this variable is highlycorrelated with the passage of local laws prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination.That is, localities that are more tolerant toward the LBG community may be more likelyto pass laws protecting LGB individuals. The \"tolerance toward the LBG community\" var-iable would most likely also be correlated with our outcome of interest in our regressions:the probability of getting a loan approved for a perceived gay couple. Thus, if we were tojust compare loan acceptance rates from (state and local) jurisdictions with laws protectingLGB individuals to jurisdictions without such laws, we might misinterpret any differenceas caused by the law when, in fact, the driving force of the difference is not the law butrather the \"tolerance toward the LGB community\" variable.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 69without such laws.237 To alleviate this potential source of statisti-cal bias, we focus only on states and localities that changed theirlaws within the time window of our dataset, 2010 to 2015. Thisallows us to compare the same local jurisdiction to itself beforeand after it passed the law. Only three states-Maine, Nevada,and Utah-and 174 local municipalities changed their laws dur-ing this window. These states and localities processed almost aquarter million loan applications from 2010 to 2015.To analyze the effectiveness of local laws, we employ adifference-in-differences regression technique. This technique,common in policy analysis,238 is a method that helps alleviate thelack of an appropriate baseline group by focusing on two base-lines. The method works as follows: First, we focus on jurisdic-tions that adopted local laws. Each such jurisdiction is comparedto itself. Specifically, we calculate the acceptance rate in thatjurisdiction before the local law was passed and compare it tothe rate after it was passed. This generates the first difference.For example, Nevada passed a law prohibiting sexual orientationdiscrimination in 2011, and it went into effect that same year.Therefore, the first step is comparing Nevada to itself. To calcu-late the first difference, the regression calculates the difference inloan acceptance rates for Nevada before and after the effectivedate. That is, we compare the acceptance rate from 2011 to 2015to the rate in 2010.This first difference, however, is not enough. It could be that,during the year the law changed, other factors that are not uniqueto Nevada influenced the results. For example, it could be that aregional crisis influenced the acceptance rate in Nevada. To ac-count for this, the regression calculates the change in acceptancerates between 2011 and 2015 compared to those in 2010 in juris-dictions that did not adopt a local rule. This is the second differ-ence. It then compares the first difference to the second one.239237 This is the case because states with these laws are probably fundamentally differ-ent from states without them.238 For the appropriate use of difference-in-differences estimators, see generallyMarianne Bertrand, Esther Duflo, and Sendhil Mullainathan, How Much Should We TrustDifferences-in-Differences Estimates?, 119 Q J Econ 249 (2004).239 Specifically, to calculate the second difference, the regression first focuses on ju-risdictions that did not adopt a local law. For each of these jurisdictions, it compares thesecond difference: the acceptance rate before and after the effective date. The regressionthen compares the first difference (the acceptance rate in Nevada in the period between2011 and 2015 minus the acceptance rate in Nevada in 2010) to the second difference(acceptance rate in all jurisdictions that did not adopt such laws for the period of 2011 to2015 minus all the acceptance rates in these states in 2010). Formally, this techniqueThe University of Chicago Law ReviewThe idea is that, while the assignment of the law is still not ran-dom, using this technique filters out any factor relevant to theoutcome of interest. Thus, all that remains is the effect of the lawand random noise not relevant to the law or the outcome.240The results of the difference-in-differences estimates of theeffect of state and local antidiscrimination laws are presented inTable 7 and Figure 10.requires the inclusion of group fixed effects that flag the treated local and state jurisdic-tions, a time-fixed effect that flags the treated time, and an interaction between the two.240 One of the assumptions of this modeling technique, however, is that the treatedstate or locality-that is, the jurisdiction that passed a law in our time window-lookedmuch like the jurisdictions that serve as controls prior to the passage of the law in termsof the outcome variables-in our case, mortgage loan approvals. This assumption is nec-essary for valid inference. See Griffin Edwards, et al, Looking Down the Barrel of a LoadedGun: The Effect of Mandatory Handgun Purchase Delays on Homicide and Suicide *14,(University of Alabama Legal Studies Research Paper No 2629397, 2017), archived athttp://perma.cc/YM24-YHHS (\"As is often the case with any policy passed by legislators,there is concern that the laws were passed endogenously to the outcome variable. We al-leviate this concern as much as possible.., by including controls that capture the politicalatmosphere of each state.\"). In the context of our study, we compare what happened toperceived LGB couples in treated jurisdictions before the law changed and find that theylooked very similar to the control states.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation DiscriminationTABLE 7: PROBABILITY OF LOAN ACCEPTANCE BY RACE ANDGENDER IN STATES WITH CHANGES TO CITY OR STATE LAW241Applicant I Co-applicant I State LawWhite MaleWhite MaleBlack MaleBlack MaleWhite FemaleWhite FemaleBlack FemaleBlack FemaleWhite FemaleWhite FemaleBlack FemaleBlack FemaleWhite MaleBlack MaleBlack Male4 +Sample SizeR SquaredBlack MaleWhite MaleBlack MaleWhite MaleBlack MaleWhite MaleBlack MaleWhite MaleBlack FemaleWhite FemaleBlack FemaleWhite FemaleBlack FemaleBlack FemaleWhite Female5,864,0860.42241 In this table, each column represents the difference-in-differences estimate of theeffect of the passage of a state law for each applicant/co-applicant pairing.

These results are derived from changes in only a handfulof cities and states and, as a result, the precision of some of theseestimated effects may suffer. This is evident in some of the largerconfidence intervals portrayed by the vertical bands in Figure 10below.With that in mind, the results presented here are quite inter-esting. To this point, regardless of how we slice the data (by re-gion, politics, bank size, or intergroup proximity), we find thatfour groups of male same-sex loan co-applicants (black male/blackmale pairs, black male/white male pairs, white male/black malepairs and white male/white male pairs) are consistently discrim-inated against. These groups are approved for the same loanswith the same income at the same banks in the same counties at242 Each difference-in-differences estimator of the effect of the passage of a state anti-sexual orientation discrimination law on each race/gender group is represented by the di-amond dots. The bands represent confidence intervals for the difference-in-differences es-timates. By way of comparison, we have also included the baseline estimates from Figure 7with triangle dots and corresponding confidence intervals. The bands represent confidenceintervals. For more information on how to interpret this graph, see the previous figures.[86:12019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 73lower rates. With the introduction of local antidiscriminationlaws, a different picture emerges. Of the four disadvantagedgroups, three are statistically indistinguishable from zero, mean-ing there is no evidence of discrimination in lending. The fourthgroup-a pair consisting of two black males-is still statisticallysignificant and negative, meaning that that group is still lesslikely to have a loan approved, but the magnitude is smaller com-pared to the main results. In Table 7, a pair of two black males is7.5 percentage points less likely to have a loan approved, all elseequal. With the passage of a state or local antidiscrimination law,that rate drops in half to 3.1. The results suggest that state- andlocal-level attempts to discourage discrimination may be fruitful.243To summarize, the analysis of the two potential mechanismsto discourage discrimination based on sexual orientation leads, atbest, to mixed results. If population density is a good proxy forintergroup contact, we find no evidence that contact in more ur-banized areas reduces the bias toward gay male couples. How-ever, local attempts to enact laws designed to protect against sex-ual orientation discrimination may hold promise in reducingdiscrimination.CONCLUSIONDiscrimination in home mortgage lending has, unfortu-nately, a long history in the United States. Recent efforts to staveoff discrimination in mortgage lending have included the creationof mortgage application databases to which lenders are requiredto report. Drawing on this data, the Article presents the first evi-dence of systematic, nationwide bias against perceived gay maleapplicants that transcends every geographical and politicalboundary in the United States. The data further suggests thatprejudice, rather than statistical discrimination, is the drivingforce. The law has much to do with the current situation. Withfew exceptions, federal law and the majority of states do not pro-hibit lenders from discriminating against applicants based ontheir sexual orientation (although some localities do). In these ju-risdictions, sexual orientation discrimination is not only legal, itis a defense that may allow a discriminatory lender to exculpateitself.243 As we explain earlier, however, the results should be taken with caution giventhat they are derived from changes in laws in only a few states and localities.The University of Chicago Law Review [86:1This study has important implications beyond the housingand mortgage lending markets. Sexual orientation discriminationhas also been a burning topic in Title VII (employment) andTitle IX (education) cases. In 2015, the same year in which theSupreme Court decided that the states are required to license andrecognize same sex marriages,244 the EEOC held that Title VII'sprohibition against sex discrimination includes sexual orienta-tion.245 That controversial decision was considered an outlier. Forover half a century, the US Courts of Appeals resisted extendingthe prohibition against sex discrimination to sexual orientation.246Although the Supreme Court has never spoken on the question,things may soon change.27 A few months ago, the Seventh Circuit,overruling previous precedents, held that sexual orientation dis-crimination is a form of sex discrimination and, therefore, is pro-hibited under Title VII.248 The decision sent shock waves through-out the legal community. And although the Seventh Circuit'sruling was limited to Title VII purposes, it marks the beginningof a more dramatic change that may spread across jurisdictionsand Titles.249244 See generally Obergefell, 135 S Ct 2584.245 See generally Baldwin v Foxx, 2015 WL 4397641 (EEOC).246 See Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae Supporting Appellees, Zarda vAltitude Express, No 15-3775, *7 (2d Cir filed July 26, 2017) (available on Westlaw at 2017WL 3277292) (DOJ Brief) (\"[Ulntil the Seventh Circuit's en banc decision in Hively earlierthis year, the ten other Courts of Appeals to have addressed the issue had uniformly joinedthis Court in holding that Title VII's prohibition on sex discrimination does not encompasssexual orientation discrimination.\").247 On May 29, 2018, the defendant-employer in Zarda filed a petition for writ forcertiorari, asking the Supreme Court to reverse the Second Circuit's decision and hold thatTitle VII does not prohibit sexual orientation discrimination. See generally Petition forWrit of Certiorari, Altitude Express, Inc v Zarda, No 17-1623 (US filed May 29, 2018). Afew days prior, on May 25, 2018, an opposing petition was filed by an employee, askingthe Supreme Court to reverse the Eleventh Circuit in Bostock v Clayton County Board ofCommissioners, 723 Fed Appx 964 (11th Cir 2018), and hold that Title VII does prohibitsexual orientation discrimination. See generally Petition for Writ of Certiorari, Bostock vClayton County Board of Commissioners, No 17-1618 (filed May 25, 2018).248 In Hively, 853 F3d at 341, the Seventh Circuit became the first court to hold that\"discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination,\" explain-ing \"the common-sense reality that it is actually impossible to discriminate on the basis ofsexual orientation without discriminating on the basis of sex.\" Id at 351. Interestingly, theSeventh Circuit is the one circuit that has explicitly rejected the Title VII framework inFH Act and/or ECOA cases. See, for example, Latimore v Citibank Federal Savings Bank,151 F3d 712, 715 (7th Cir 1998) (rejecting McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting in favor ofdirect or circumstantial evidence).249 Recent developments in the Second Circuit are illustrative. On April 18, 2017, theSecond Circuit upheld its precedent that sexual orientation discrimination is not prohib-ited by Title VII. See generally Zarda, 855 F3d 76. The decision did not last long. On May3, 2017, two weeks after the decision in Zarda, the District Court for the Southern District2019] Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination 75This Article can inform the ongoing debate over Title VII andother laws in pari materia. Indeed, with one exception,250 all UScircuit courts now adopt and apply Title VII's jurisprudence inmortgage lending.251 The same is true for the agencies in chargeof enforcing the ECOA and FH Act.252We end with an open invitation. Sexual orientation discrimi-nation research is in its very early stages, with the first majorstudy conducted overseas as late as 2009. We hope that our studywill add to an important discussion that, to date, involves manytheories but little empirical evidence. In that sense, a major con-tribution of our study is setting the grounds for a new form ofeconometric studies in the area.of New York defied the Second Circuit's precedent. See Philpott v New York, 252 F Supp3d 313, 317 (SDNY 2017). Relying on the Seventh Circuit decision in Hively, it held thatTitle VII's prohibition against sex discrimination also prohibits sexual orientation discrim-ination. See id at 316-17. On May 25, 2017, the Second Circuit granted Zarda's requestfor rehearing en banc to consider whether Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basisof sexual orientation through its prohibition of discrimination \"[b]ecause of... sex.\" SeeZarda, 883 F3d at 113. On July 26, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an amicuscuriae brief on behalf of the United States arguing that \"the en banc Court should reaffirmits settled precedent holding, consistent with the longstanding position of the Departmentof Justice, that Title VII does not reach discrimination based on sexual orientation.\" DOJBrief at *1 (cited in note 246). On February 26, 2018, the Second Circuit rejected the DOJ'sargument and reversed its decision. Deciding en banc, it held that sexual orientation dis-crimination is a \"subset of sex discrimination,\" thereby overruling Simonton and Dawson.See Zarda, 883 F3d at 112; see also notes 23-27 and accompanying text.250 Of the circuits that have considered the issue, the Seventh Circuit stands alone inrejecting Title VII jurisprudence to evaluate ECOA cases. See Latimore v Citibank FederalSavings Bank, 151 F3d 712, 715 (7th Cir 1998). In Latimore, Judge Richard Posner, theauthor of the Hively decision, held that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting frameworkfor establishing a prima facie case in the employment discrimination context is unsuitablein credit discrimination cases because \"there is no basis for comparing the defendant'streatment of the plaintiff with the defendant's treatment of other, similarly situated per-sons.\" Id. Accordingly, in ECOA cases in the Seventh Circuit, the plaintiff must prove hercase \"in a conventional way, using direct or circumstantial evidence.\" Id. See alsoMatthiesen v Banc One Mortgage Corp, 173 F3d 1242, 1246 n 4 (10th Cir 1999) (decliningto reach the question of whether the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting standard appliesin ECOA cases).251 See note 248.252 See Part I.A.2.",

    "abstract": "This study is the first to empirically demonstrate widespread discrimination across the United States based on perceived sexual orientation sex and race in the mortgage lending process Our analysis of over five million mortgage applications reveals that any FHA loan application filed by samesex male coapplicants is significantly less likely to be approved compared to the white heterosexual baseline holding lending risk constant The most likely explanation for this pattern is sexual orientation based discrimination  ” despite the fact that FHA loans are the only type of loan in which discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is prohibited brbrMoreover we find compelling evidence to support the intersectionality theory According to this theory when sex and race unite a new form of discrimination emerges that cannot be explained by sexism and racism alone The data unequivocally indicates that the race and sex of samesex applicants play a role and result in a unique and previously unobserved pattern This discriminatory pattern plagues every region in the US and it transcends party lines ie it is present in red blue and swing states Furthermore upending conventional wisdom the data reveals that big banks discriminate at the same rate as small banks and lenders in urban environments are as discriminatory as rural lenders Prior studies failed to reveal this phenomenon due to data constraints and design flaws These studies relied on testers posing as applicants and none could investigate how intersectionality influences lending practices brbrDespite the grim results a silver lining exists We find that the pattern of discrimination diminishes or disappears in states and localities that pass antisexual orientation discrimination laws These findings have important and timely implications In 2017 a new bill offering nationwide protection from sexual orientation credit discrimination was introduced The same year has experienced tectonic changes in Title VII jurisprudence Our study can reinvigorate the debate and help policy makers tailor remedies that would correct the discriminatory pattern this study unravel",
