The language is intended to create a desire to give and for good reason: every two seconds someone needs blood!3  But, it also sends an implicit message about heroism and morality; if heroes give blood then those who do not must be morally corrupt.4  It’s a logical fallacy, especially because some choose not to donate while others are prohibited from doing so, but words impact society’s perceptions and opinions.5  This unintended  © 2018 Heather Printz *The Journal of Health Care Law and Policy originally received this piece for publication in late 2015.

The roots of characterization run deep.  In the 1980s, a mysterious epidemic swept the nation.10  No one could pinpoint its cause or origin, creating a public health crisis but eliciting few ideas for an appropriate response.11  Initially, the group of infections later known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) were thought to be transmitted exclusively by men having intercourse with other   6.

Facially, the revised ban allows more MSM to donate but in practice it continues to prevent most from doing so, based solely on sexual orientation.30  From the first suggestions that HIV was uniquely or particularly related to male homosexuality, advocates have advanced public policy, scientific, administrative, and constitutional arguments against singling out the group and later against the lifetime deferral.31  In light of the revised deferral, this Comment departs slightly from those paths and argues that the revision maintains the same discriminatory effect by going against notions of administrative constitutionalism, equal protection, and principles of bioethics.  This Comment further argues that the revision does not effectively reflect scientific advancements, that science does not support singling out MSM as a category, and that the relevant science does not exist in a vacuum but must consider the social impact. Part I describes the evolution of HIV/AIDS and the prohibition on MSM blood donation.32  Part II describes previous attempts to revise the ban, the contours of the revision, and some defenses and reactions to the FDA’s proposal and final guidance.33  Part III argues that the FDA has an obligation to interpret its guidelines in tune with standard constitutional interpretations, that the direction of constitutional jurisprudence with respect to members of the LGBTQ community has been racing toward elevated scrutiny so the policy could soon face a potentially fatal constitutional challenge, and that despite scientific support for a one-year deferral over a lifetime ban, the use of MSM as a category is not supported by science.34 I. EVOLUTION OF BLOOD DONATION GUIDELINES IN THE CONTEXT OF HIV The obscure infections later known as HIV were identified in 1980.35  Between October 1980 and May 1981, five otherwise healthy, homosexual men in Los Angeles were treated for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia—a rare lung infection.36  On June 5, 1981, the CDC described these cases in the Morbidity   30.

Traditional Substantive Review Ordinarily, administrative procedure dictates that an agency is uniquely responsible for creating and giving meaning to its own guidelines and must adhere to the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) in doing so.126  The APA allows judicial review of an agency action for “[a] person suffering legal wrong . . .,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.”127  Assuming arguendo that the FDA followed the proper procedure in enacting the guideline, an MSM prevented from donating blood could challenge it, if the guideline is entitled to judicial review.128  After determining it is entitled to judicial review, a reviewing court would use one of three standards to determine whether the guideline is permissible: arbitrary and capricious, de novo, or substantial evidence.129  The most appropriate standard would be arbitrary and capricious.130  In utilizing this standard, the court would evaluate “whether the [action] was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.”131  The court would also invalidate an action as arbitrary and   125.

MSM who remain celibate for one year are now aligned with that of other high-risk groups, so the policy purports to treat at least some similar situations the same.137  But the FDA ignores the similarity between “high-risk” heterosexual behaviors like general promiscuity, which are not even questioned, let alone addressed, and the perceived high-risk of sexually active MSM.  These heterosexuals arguably present a higher risk than sexually active MSM because that group incudes those who are not actually at high risk.  The FDA rests its justification for the disparity on the statistic that MSM are more likely to have HIV but takes that statistic at face value and obscures the actual risk of MSM, an act that is not risky in and of itself, as compared to the actual risks of heterosexual sexual behavior.  MSM are deferred for one year but heterosexuals are only deferred for one year if they have engaged in one specific risky sexual practice: prostitution.  Leaving this group unaddressed allows the FDA to ignore the principle of treating like health risks alike. A court may also consider an agency action irrational if the agency “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.”138  The FDA entirely fails to consider all relevant factors and important aspects of the HIV problem.  First, it does not account for the growing number of heterosexuals with HIV.  Almost thirty years to the day after the CDC published the original guidelines outlining   132.

If heterosexuals possess approximately one-third of the risk in transmitting HIV, why are they freely permitted to donate with little accountability for their sexual history?  Additionally, the FDA ignores the fact that AIDS disproportionally burdens African Americans of any sexual orientation by 21%.140  Second, the FDA fails to address data indicating that the chances of getting AIDS through blood transfusions are greater than through risky sex in the first place.141  The CDC’s website clearly states that for every 10,000 people exposed to AIDS, 92.5% of the infections will have come from a blood transfusion but only 1.49% of infections will have come from anal sex and only 1.61% from all sex practices by persons of any orientation.142  Despite this scientific data, the guideline singles out MSM-specific sexual practices but does not address any of these factors that are also relevant to protecting the blood supply. Administrative challenges permit a court to evaluate a guideline on its merits without reaching the question of constitutionality, if it is able.143  The court prefers to avoid constitutional challenges whenever possible.  No version of the MSM guideline has been challenged in court on any grounds but some foreshadowing of a discriminatory challenge, although in the context of geographic and national origin as a basis for deferral, arose at the 1990 BPAC meeting.144  One director at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) stated that the “primary responsibility of the FDA is to assure the safety of the national blood supply.

Canon of Constitutional Avoidance All branches of government are guided by the Constitution and, as part of the executive branch, agencies have a “legally enforceable duty to avoid” infringing it, in addition to their responsibilities under the APA.146  There is a unique link between constitutional and administrative law because some administrative doctrines are created to meet constitutional requirements and “agencies are encouraged to take constitutional concerns seriously in their decision-making.”147  This means administrative law runs parallel to the idea of “constitutional common law,” as coined by Henry Monaghan, which refers to “a substructure of substantive, procedural, and remedial rules drawing their inspiration and authority from, but not required by, various constitutional provisions [and] subject to amendment, modification, or even reversal by Congress.”148  Constitutional common law finds an unacknowledged mooring in administrative law which has requirements under both the APA and the Constitution, although constitutional common law has been criticized as “judicial lawmaking” and the Supreme Court has downplayed the influence of the Constitution on judicial review.149  However, the constitutional gloss over administrative agencies generally lends credence to the idea that the FDA has somewhat of an obligation, similar to the court’s use of the canon of constitutional avoidance, to avoid reaching constitutional lines when creating guidelines that may face judicial review. In F.C.C v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., the Supreme Court rejected the argument that “agency decisions implicating constitutional liberties trigger more stringent arbitrary and capricious review.”150  Writing for the majority, Justice Scalia found “the canon of constitutional avoidance was an interpretive tool to be used only to construe ambiguous statutory language to avoid serious constitutional doubts.”151  He noted that no precedent required the Court to apply the canon to limit the scope of authorized action and that the APA distinguishes   146.

Because the separation between administrative and constitutional law is not as wide as Justice Scalia suggested, “concern that a reviewing court may invoke the canon in lieu of [another test determining] deference may [incentivize] an agency to forgo broad assertions of authority or interpretations of ambiguous statutes” that would otherwise draw the agency toward the perpetually blurry lines that make up the parameters of the Constitution.165  In doing this, the agency gives up some deference to make policy but also averts unfavorable judicial review that could undermine its decisions altogether.166  The FDA should reevaluate its guideline so as not to implicate the Constitution because the current policy risks evaluation under   160.

If an MSM challenged the guideline, a court would necessarily have to attempt to decide the question before it without reaching the constitutional question but if it could not, it faces other problems explained below.  Yet, even if a guideline might pass constitutional muster, agencies should not disregard issues that draw it near a constitutional question in the first place.167   However, actual constitutionality becomes less important if an agency can justify and explain its constitutional considerations in decision-making.  “[C]areful explanation of how constitutional concerns were accommodated or why [they] are outweighed is all that an agency must supply.  It then becomes the courts’ responsibility to determine whether the agency’s decision accords with constitutional requirements.”168  In the context of the MSM guideline, the FDA might be required to explain the science they rely upon to justify the continued use of a policy that is so clearly discriminatory, which could pose problems explained below. Even without a requirement that an agency consider constitutional concerns or an incentive to avoid judicial review lest the Court overturn the agency action, decision-making in enacting guidelines should be inspired by the reaches of the Constitution.169  Congress gives agencies significant independent discretion in shaping national policy.170  Sometimes “taking constitutional values into account may change shape of federal regulation and make it less effective in achieving congressional regulatory goals but Congress might well accept a trade-off of regulatory effectiveness for greater protection of constitutional values.”171  Congress gave the FDA, as an agency of HHS, power to protect the health of the nation but Congress has also made clear it disfavors the FDA’s revised MSM blood ban.  As shown by the statistics above, it is not even clear Congress has to trade effectiveness for a non-discriminatory policy.  A blood deferral policy based on screening questions and risky behavior would satisfy both goals of policy effectiveness and constitutional avoidance. But agencies should also want to embrace their influential role as leaders.172  Agencies can exercise considerable influence in making polices that have   167.

Rather than simply adjusting the ban based on “science,” the FDA should amend its guideline to affirmatively promote the values and address the concerns of recent jurisprudence on LGBTQ discrimination. B. Constitutional Complications Commentators also argue the new deferral for MSM blood donations is as discriminatory as the original and may violate some guarantees protected by the Constitution.  Both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution are used to provide a framework to analyze possible discrimination, however the Due Process Clause is reserved for deprivations of a fundamental liberty or right and blood donation is unlikely to qualify as either.175 Therefore, this comment proceeds via challenge to the Equal Protection Clause. Although the ban unquestionably discriminated against homosexual men when it was enacted, and the new guideline likely does as well, traditional Equal Protection arguments have not gained traction because sexual orientation has never been considered a suspect or quasi-suspect class subject to elevated scrutiny against governmental discrimination.  This section argues that the FDA’s revision amounts to both de jure and de facto discrimination and that, although it would be analyzed under (and may pass) rational basis scrutiny because sexual orientation is not a suspect class, given the Court’s recent decisions and the pro-LGBTQ direction of the other government branches, the Court is likely to make sexual orientation a suspect or quasi-suspect class soon, which would raise the scrutiny level of government action and require a complete overhaul of the FDA’s new guideline. 1.

If a government action is plainly discriminatory on its face, a plaintiff need not make any other showing before the action is evaluated.  If a government action is facially neutral but a plaintiff claims a discriminatory impact, that plaintiff will also need to show discriminatory intent or purpose before evaluation.177  To show discriminatory intent, the “challenged classification must single out a particular class for disadvantageous treatment and that such was motivated by discriminatory purpose.”178  “Discriminatory purpose implies the decision maker selected or reaffirmed a course of action at least in part because of, not merely in spite of, its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.”179  Proof is obtained from non-exclusive factors like whether history “reveals a series of official actions taken for invidious purposes,” substantive “departure from normal procedure,” or legislative and administrative history of discrimination.180 Both the original guideline and the revision to the MSM deferral result in de jure discrimination against MSM because the language of the guideline singles them out, although the FDA attempts to downplay the impact of the unambiguous language.  The FDA website states the policy is not discriminatory because it is “based on the documented increased risk of certain transfusion transmissible infections, such as HIV, associated with male-to-male sex and is not based on any judgment concerning the donor’s sexual orientation.”181  Despite this self-serving statement, the FDA does make a judgment concerning sexual orientation, as illustrated by the 1992 memorandum and the BPAC meeting that preceded it.  At the meeting, the agency discussed changing the deferral period for MSM and their female sexual partners.182  Changing the deferral for female sexual partners but not MSM was justified as a “distinction between a person who themselves engaged in risky behavior versus persons who   176.

The revised guideline claims to be based entirely on scientific data, suggesting MSM is still viewed in the same light—that their lifestyle choice is risky—but despite this lifestyle choice, some blood donations are now acceptable because science can protect the blood supply enough to overcome them. This discussion at the meeting alternatively reflects de facto discrimination.  The impact of the ban is clear but its intent and purpose is demonstrated in noting that historically, the ban has been motivated by fear and discrimination.185  With respect to de facto discrimination, proof in the form of a substantive departure may be relevant, “if the factors usually considered important by the decision-maker strongly favor a decision contrary to the one reached.”186  As long as the MSM deferral has existed, the FDA has relied on the fact that the MSM group is statistically more likely to have HIV.  Although it now claims science allows it to move the deferral from a lifetime to one year, that statistic while mostly irrelevant is still true.  The blood tests the FDA relies upon have been in existence for years and can detect the presence of HIV in men who have had sex with men since last year or last month.  Although the latency period plays a role in length of deferral, risky behavior should be deferred rather than people who identify with a certain sexual orientation.  A factor that has continued to be important to the FDA is safety of the blood supply.  It now finds it safe to allow a small portion of MSM to donate blood but entirely ignores the risk factor presented by a group that can already give it almost without restriction: heterosexuals. 2. The Scrutiny Level Should Be Elevated Beyond Rational Basis Equal Protection claims are reviewed under three standards of scrutiny: strict, intermediate, and rational basis.187  Rational basis is the lowest form of review for an Equal Protection challenge.188  Under rational basis review, “legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification   183.

The revision does not change that analysis; the same arguments made against the lifetime deferral apply with equal force to the one-year deferral minus those that spoke to the inequality of the timeframe.  If the guideline is presented as a constitutional question, the Court may apply rational basis scrutiny because sexual orientation is not a class that automatically requires heightened scrutiny and the FDA relies on science to enact a guideline that relates to public health.  Unless the Court found the scientific evidence the FDA relied on in perpetuating the ban was scientifically untenable, which it might for reasons discussed in Part III, C, the FDA could win.  However, the Court is also poised to increase the scrutiny level for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation as evidenced by the recent social and legal changes with respect to LGBTQ rights and a challenge to the FDA’s one-year ban would not survive elevated scrutiny. a. The Possibility of Heightened Scrutiny Due to Animus The next official step on the scrutiny ladder is intermediate but between that and rational basis lies an unofficial level sometimes labeled “rational basis with bite.”191  Scrutiny beyond rational basis but not quite reaching the intermediate level has been found where the Court established “animus.”192  An exact definition of animus has never been clearly delineated by the Court but it has been described as a “bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group” or demonstrated by “fear, stereotype, bias, or a simple desire to exclude.”193  Laws that reflect the latter grouping qualitatively “express, create, and enforce distinctions between social groups, tending to create a caste society” and both describe what the Equal Protection Clause is purported to protect   189.

Texas extended the idea first considered in Romer v. Evans, that homosexuals should be given greater protection under the Equal Protection Clause and that a heightened scrutiny level might be more appropriate.196  The Lawrence holding rested on the Due Process Clause but Justice O’Connor’s concurrence implicated the Equal Protection Clause and purported to deviate from rational basis to protect persons affected by a law that reached and burdened sexual orientation but did not make it an official class due heightened protection.197  More recently, in U.S. v. Windsor, Justice Kennedy spoke of animus and disparate treatment in the context of same-sex marriage, referring to variations of the word “dignity” eleven times in driving home the point that all persons seeking to get married should be viewed as equal under the law.198  He spoke of the dignity of same-sex couples, their families, and their marriages and scolded Congress for interfering with it, noting that discrimination was not just the effect of the statute but its very essence as demonstrated by House reports defending “traditional heterosexual marriage.”199  He also noted that “[t]he avowed purpose and practical effect of the law here in question was to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma . . . [was] made lawful.”200 It is possible that if the FDA guideline were brought before the Court on the discrimination question, it could be evaluated under the same “rational basis with bite” standard.

The judicial concept of animus toward LGBTQ rights discussed in a multitude of cases suggests the direction of jurisprudence makes it suitable for LGBTQ to become a protected class in the near future. b. The Possibility of Heightened Scrutiny Due to Changing Legal Climate In the past five years, our country has seen monumental steps toward LGBTQ rights in the abandonment of major federal policies that differentiated groups based on sexual orientation.  In 2010, President Obama signed legislation to repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the code that prohibited openly LGBTQ people from serving in the military.203  The military is certainly not a “social service agency” and yet issues of discrimination did not “lie outside of its province.”204 The very first objective of the law is to “determine any impacts to military readiness,” suggesting the primary goal in seeking to change its discriminatory policy is to evaluate any potential consequence to national security.205  The FDA’s primary objective in considering a change to its policy was also to maintain safety, but rather than removing its discriminatory characteristics, the FDA promoted safety by only allowing a small number of additional donations from those on the outermost fringes of “risky behavior,” but continues to categorizes people based on their private sexual choices.  In a formal statement addressing the repeal, the President stated he was proud to sign the legislation because it “bring[s] us closer to the principles of equality and fairness that define us as Americans.”206  This example of the executive branch changing   201. See Bensing, supra note 11, at 503 (explaining that an administrative guideline, while not generally considering binding or having the force and effect of law, can be construed as such if its “impact ‘is sufficiently direct and immediate and has a direct effect on . . . day-to-day business’”).   202.

Further, both the legislative and executive branches often compel “statutory and regulatory restrictions on administrative decision-making” that demonstrate their intention that agencies consider constitutional implications, further suggesting that the FDA be guided by the leader of its own branch of government as well as by the legislative branch.207 Three years later, U.S. v. Windsor struck down a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”) as unconstitutional because its definition of marriage served to undercut the dignity afforded to people in same-sex marriages and violated their liberty interest under the Due Process Clause.208  Then on June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court held that all same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges.209  This opinion, also written by Justice Kennedy, focused on the institution of marriage and its meaning to anyone who seeks to enter into it.210  The holding is grounded in the Due Process Clause but Justice Kennedy cited earlier cases as evidence that due process and equal protection are often two sides of the same coin, stating that “rights implicit in liberty and rights secured by equal protection may rest on different precepts and are not always co-extensive, yet each may be instructive as to the meaning and reach of the other.”211  The opinion outlined how marriage has evolved, an evolution that has “strengthened, not weakened, the institution,” then analogized that evolution to treatment of the LGBTQ community, from the initial condemnation to the eventual public acceptance.212  Implicit in the language is a principle reminiscent of a different opinion Justice Kennedy took part in, Planned Parenthood of Pennsylvania v. Casey.  In considering the clear impropriety of earlier cases, Casey explained that in times of “national controversy,” “changed circumstances may impose new obligations.”213  In both   207.

The message also serves to “characterize animus as something akin to unconscious bias as opposed to malicious intent” in that bias is often perpetuated by history rather than by something darker.214  In considering those judicial remarks, the FDA should take a hard look at the shadowy history of the MSM deferral and reconsider whether keeping a categorical ban on MSM behavior is the best way to preserve the safety of the blood supply or if there is an obligation to overhaul an entire deferral system that was predicated on discrimination. The combined impact of the statements on LGBTQ rights from the judicial branch, including the criticism of the legislative branch in Windsor, the President repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” and Congress’ continued support for a less discriminatory revision of the MSM blood donation deferral suggests the FDA must move toward a less discriminatory practice in order to conform with other areas of government.  While the revision from a lifetime deferral to a one-year deferral hides behind science for support, it was discriminatory when it was enacted and it is equally discriminatory now.  A meaningful revision to the policy must be grounded in safety but the FDA cannot ignore the inherent discrimination in light of the governmental direction with respect to LGBTQ rights, even if ameliorating social justice is “not in their province.” Although the FDA’s revision to the MSM deferral policy does not yet violate the Constitution as it does not relate to a liberty interest or affect a protected class due heightened scrutiny, it is difficult to say the FDA can ignore the current social climate or the potential for sexual orientation to become a protected class in the near future.  With changes to major laws affecting LGBTQ rights and the Supreme Court’s recent decisions on the issue, it is possible the Court will soon elevate the scrutiny afforded to sexual orientation and the laws that discriminate against LGBTQ to a level beyond rational basis and the FDA should be prepared. C. Synthetic Science Solves the Wrong Problem Scientific advancements in determining what causes HIV, as well as improved blood testing, have done much to prevent the spread of the disease through blood transfusion, making a lifetime deferral on MSM donating blood   214.

PRINTZF1 FINAL (DO NOT DELETE) 11/12/2018  12:52 PM 104 JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE LAW & POLICY [VOL. 20:073  unnecessary.215  The FDA acknowledged this when it announced that moving to a one-year deferral was scientifically supported.216  Although science technically supports the fact that moving from lifetime deferral to one year is safe, science does not support a celibacy requirement exclusively for MSM.  MSM are statistically more likely to have HIV but HIV is neither exclusive to nor caused by men having sex with other men.  Therefore, the FDA should consider the scientific arbitrariness of the classification and the scope of the ban should be revised rather than the length. When AIDS was first reported, it was thought to come from being gay.217  Although that was disproved less than two years later, all versions of the guidelines have mentioned some variation of homosexual men as a high-risk category.218  Risky behavior such as unprotected sex, multiple partners, and sharing needles leads to the spread of AIDS.219  The act of men having sex with men is not inherently risky.220  The new policy prevents sexually active homosexual men from donating blood based on their sexual orientation rather than their actual risk to the blood supply—that isn’t science.  The agency forges a scientifically flawed distinction between MSM and heterosexual donors by categorizing and deferring donation based on one group’s risky behaviors but not the other group’s arguably riskier behaviors.221  The FDA recognized early on that “describing behavior is a better way to achieve public policy goals rather than using labels,” but never ameliorated the negative impact of its categorical distinctions.222  The oldest guidelines specified homosexual men as a high-risk category and newer ones addressed risky behavior of men having sex with other men generally, but all variations only address risky behavior of homosexual men and no one else.

Yet, even if one concedes that “men who have had sex with another man even one time since 1977,” or even since last year, may have a statistically higher prevalence of AIDS than any other group, it is merely correlation, not causation.223 The FDA stated it examined alternatives to the one-year deferral but the available scientific evidence best supported this option.224  The policy chosen has a demonstrated success rate in other countries with epidemiology similar to ours and was “based both on how the disease circulates in this country and on how donors here are screened.”225  Information for less than a twelve-month deferral was not available.226   The FDA noted that HIV is too prevalent in this country to completely lift the ban and move to risk-based screening like some countries.227  By the agency’s calculation, individualized screening would cause the risk of receiving infected blood to quadruple from its current likelihood of one in 1.5 million.228 But in response to one advocacy group who protested the December 2014 deferral announcement, the FDA is on record stating that self-assessment is unreliable, burdensome to donation centers, and offensive to donors.229  Self-assessments are used to screen heterosexual donors so it does not make sense that they would be less reliable for MSM donors.230  Considering the blood shortage, it is hardly likely blood donation centers would be burdened by potentially eligible donors that might increase their workload.  The claim that self-assessment might be offensive arguably pales in comparison to the offense currently claimed by advocacy groups. The FDA claims to rely on science, but despite extensive research, the FDA admitted it “suffered from serious scientific deficiencies” and separately justified   223.

Further, its continued reliance on antiquated and illogical categorizations in the face of actual science and social progress sabotages their overall credibility.232 In considering the grand scheme of protecting the nation’s blood supply, donor deferral is but one piece.233  Blood testing itself is another large component.  It should not be surprising that human error in handling the blood detracts from the overall safety of the supply.234  That includes both at the donation level and use level.  The related medical fields have utilized a concept called “purity in the bag,” which allows for more donors and the possibility of an increased blood supply by focusing on testing blood after it has been received.235  While it is not advantageous to let just anyone donate, the practice would still ensure the safety of the blood supply regardless of deferral reason. Currently, blood testing is so accurate that the possibility of anyone getting AIDS from a blood transfusion is small.236  Despite this, successful transmission of AIDS is actually more likely to occur through transfusion of infected blood than through intercourse with an infected person, so the chances of getting HIV from blood donated by MSM is actually infinitesimal.237  Regardless of the donor, at least one test can reveal an HIV infection in less than two weeks and all tests can detect blood-borne pathogens “within 45 days of exposure.”238  The National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) explained that positive HIV test results   231.

The length of the ban is not what troubles advocates; it is the implications of stigma and a de facto ban for all men who continue to safely engage in the behavior the FDA is so adamant about singling out. Another consideration for protecting the blood supply is that our country is experiencing a blood shortage of crisis proportions.  “In September 2014 ABC News reported severe blood shortages in major cities including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Detroit, Philadelphia and Baltimore, with some hospitals reporting to being down to a single day’s supply.”242  The FDA claims it has a responsibility to maintain blood product safety but cannot ignore the fact that entirely removing the MSM ban could save approximately 657,000 lives, annually.”243 The FDA promised it would continue to assess the policy as science progressed.244  If the one-year deferral is considered only a starting point, its trajectory should be to eliminate broad overgeneralizations and end with a guideline that focuses on meaningful questions about risky behavior, focused on individual evaluation with assessment for donor suitability.  One example would be to ask all donors, regardless of sexual orientation, “[i]n the past [two months],   239.

The safety of moving to a risk-based screening has been documented abroad.  In 2001, Italy began using to an individualized, “risk-based questionnaire for donors, as opposed to a blanket deferral of MSM donors.”247  They saw an increase in HIV-positive donations but found heterosexual donors caused that increase.248  In November 2015, France also reported an upcoming change to their MSM policy: MSM who have been celibate for one year may donate and MSM who have been monogamous or celibate “could donate after four months.”249  Moving to a risk-based assessment system here would also allow a significant increase in blood donations, would help to decrease the blood shortage, and would work to erase the continued belief that homosexual men are “contaminated.” Some may consider the additional costs and risk of error in screening so many donors as an obstacle, but those issues would arise with any increase in blood donation, as demonstrated in Italy.250  There is no way to combat an increased risk in error; any increase in donor pool logically increases the risk of error.  If ending the blood shortage is a priority, the FDA must be prepared to screen more blood and expect more errors.  However, with respect to the additional cost, the FDA is unable to “consider financial matters when making policy decisions.”251 Risk, as a concept has been evaluated extensively and experts agree it is a “social, moral, economic and political concept as much as a scientific one.”252  As one representative from the NIH predicted ten years ago, the MSM policy isn’t just about science, it’s a social justice problem and a fairness problem.253   245.

The Ban Goes Against Patient Autonomy and Social Justice Almost as long as the MSM deferral has been in place, the weight of scholarly authority has attacked it from administrative and constitutional law perspectives.  This Comment also evaluates the deferral from the bioethical and public health ethics standpoint.255 The height of the civil rights movement brought recognition to ideas of dignity and equality, impacting philosophical study, which began to focus on practical ethics as opposed to abstract ideas about morality.256  Philosophers started to consider pragmatic issues like “abortion and euthanasia, the ethics of war and of capital punishment, and the allocation of scarce medical resources.”257  This was one piece of a larger puzzle that created bioethics as a discipline.258  The law powerfully informs “ethical reflection on moral responsibilities” which explains why lawmakers, government administrators, and a variety of professional organizations often seek bioethicists for consultation.259  Therefore, the principles of bioethics and the study of dignity and fairness are relevant to a discussion about the need for a safe blood supply and the use of a discriminatory policy to achieve it.  It has been argued that BPAC, and likely the FDA, lacked “the social, ethical, political, and economic expertise necessary to understand the full ramifications of the decisions it was making.”260  Although the statement refers to the very early deferral conversations, it is arguably still true.261 There are various ethical paradigms in which to consider the breadth of issues that arise when considering the influence of bioethics on the law but this Comment will evaluate the MSM deferral under the Four Principles Approach, which employs the following duties: respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.262   254.

Respect for Autonomy: “Otherness” The first pillar of bioethics describes the idea of choice and one’s ability to make certain choices for himself.263  Setting aside the question of whether being homosexual is a choice or an innate and immutable characteristic, engaging in homosexual behavior is a choice.  A blood donation deferral category that singles out men who choose to engage in homosexual behavior is one of many ways the government acts to question the legitimacy of same-sex relations and the choice to engage in them.264  Judicial precedent disfavors that governmental propensity in the context of continued oppression of people who choose to engage in homosexual acts or marry someone of the same sex.265  In Obergefell, Justice Kennedy noted that the liberty contemplated by the Due Process Clause “extend[s] to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs.”266  The very holding of Obergefell rests on notions of autonomy and the freedom to engage in certain acts that are considered a fundamental right.267  To be sure, there is no fundamental right to donate blood but there is a right to have the government respect one’s autonomy and at the very least, notions of administrative constitutionalism instruct agencies to consider issues like discrimination.268  Continued use of this particular deferral language is another avenue for the government to attempt to control disfavored behavior.   Discouraging autonomy calls to mind the notion of “otherness” which occurs when those of “privilege and power” are called on to define discrimination to the exclusion of anyone else.269 This creates an “us” versus “them” scenario which contributes to a backhanded loss of autonomy.  No one wants to be excluded from the “in” crowd so to avoid the “otherness”, people who otherwise would not are forced to hide their true identity. A second consideration is that the blood donor questionnaire itself assumes a “gender binary” or “an understanding of gender that classifies all persons as male or female and ignores persons who identify otherwise.”270  Again, setting aside the question of whether that sense of self-identity is something that can be altered, not all people simply identify as male or female, which can be confusing in the blood donation context.  This results in burdening people in a certain   263. Quinn, supra note 262, at 39 (quoting Beauchamp & Childress).  264. See Murphy, supra note 245.  265. See generally Obergefell v.

The new blood donation guideline perpetuates problems of gender binary, exclusion, and government challenge to homosexual practices and conflicts with the ideas of autonomy.  2. Nonmaleficence: Moral Panic Techniques The second pillar of the bioethical framework is maleficence; the idea that it is unjust to harm or inflict suffering on others.272  One problem with the continued use of homosexual male behavior as a deferral indicator is what it implies.  In one example, it was noted that monogamous homosexual men are barred but promiscuous heterosexuals are not, which “support[s] a longtime, ugly belief that gay men are in some sense contaminated.”273  Others assert that because homosexuality was historically classified as a mental disorder and people still find homosexuals to be ill-omened, the lifetime ban is a way to repress homosexuality using science to instill fear.274 The revision lifts the lifetime ban in favor of a one-year deferral but because it functions as a de facto lifetime ban, the effects are the same.  Whether there is a way to quantitatively say that people believe homosexual men are contaminated or have a mental disorder, the FDA deferral acts to perpetuate that belief.  The simple act of singling them out without more than an unjustified reliance on science perpetuates a “moral panic.”  A moral panic is defined as “a method of placing a social issue in terms of an illness. A panic links one suspect thing with one definitely bad thing, which gives the message that the suspect thing must actually be bad.”275  Here, the deferral works to keep HIV synonymous with homosexual males, perpetuating the fallacy that they are more closely related than is actually correct.276 A second justification on which the FDA may implicitly rely is the history of HIV impact on hemophiliacs.277  Hemophiliacs receive regular blood transfusions and were deeply and tragically affected by the lack of early information about HIV.278  Much of the blame fell on those who delayed ensuring   271.

Beneficence: Ideas of Civil Duty The bioethical principle of beneficence articulates the idea of “promoting good.”282  The revised FDA ban deprives an entire class of persons from engaging in what some consider a civic duty: the opportunity to engage in the altruistic act of donating blood to save a life.  Some men find a way to “beat the system” and lie on the blood bank questionnaire, just to have the ability to help those in need.283  Many homosexual men did just that after the World Trade Center attacks.284  The FDA recognizes that people want to help yet they cling to the stated obligation that safety is paramount.285  This is a “classic framing of ethical dilemmas in public health: a collective good . . . is posited as in conflict with the interests or rights of individuals.”286  In this case “donor rights to give blood and recipient rights to receive safe blood” are set up as necessarily opposing views, preventing any solution for both goals to be achieved.287  Rather than promote good, the deferral policy constrains it.   279.

Justice-Language The last pillar of bioethics focuses on fairness.288  Discrimination, or the unfair treatment of a group, is the ultimate injustice.289  “Social justice requires not the melting away of differences but promoting respect for group differences without oppression.”290  Through the power of language, the deferral revision reinforces injustice in two ways.  Much like the use of moral panic techniques, subtle use of language reinforces stigmatization.291 First, blood donation centers “have developed a metaphor that giving blood makes one morally virtuous.”292  The implied alternative is that people who do not may be “morally suspect” or defective in some way, whether physically or in a social sense of not valuing life enough to donate blood to support it.293  Although the blood donation industry fought to change the policy, they are constrained by the FDA through licensing and can only accept donations within FDA parameters. Second, the FDA’s change in terminology through the years reflects at least a slight move away from sexual orientation and toward risky behavior.294  Despite this, their continued singling out approved donors based on sexual orientation rather than actual risk perpetuates the stigma that advocates have been trying to overcome since the ban was enacted.  Removing the lifetime deferral to include at least some MSM donors subtly reflects its acknowledgement of original overinclusiveness but it does not go far enough.  CONCLUSION Although the move from a lifetime deferral to a one-year ban is a step in the right direction, it still acts as a de facto lifetime ban on most men in the MSM category.  The new policy will allow more homosexual men to donate, increasing the blood supply, but this amendment to the deferral category continues to hold the MSM population under unnecessary scrutiny in light of scientific, legal, and social advancements.  The FDA engages in a mindset that if a MSM continues to engage in risky behavior, he should be deferred. While the new policy brings MSM in line with other groups designated high-risk, the whole deferral system   288. Quinn, supra note 262, at 40.  289.

The only fair and viable solution is to move away from categorical screening and toward risk-based screening.  ",
