This research focuses on the experiences of 30 LGB individuals (23males and 7 females), with a mean age of 25.07 years (SD = 4,578), living in urbanand rural areas of Southern Italy. Focalized open interviews were conducted, and theGrounded Theory Methodology, supported by the Atlas.ti 8.0 software, was used fordata analysis. The textual material was first coded, and then codes were grouped intofive macro-categories: Freedom of identity expression in the urban and rural context,identity construction and acceptance process, need of aggregation and identificationwith the LGB community, role of the interpersonal relationship in the process of identityacceptance, socio-cultural context, and LGB psychological well-being. The resultsshowed a condition common to the two contexts that we can define as “ghettoization.”The young LGB is alone in the rural area due to a lack of places and people to identifywith and greater social isolation. On the contrary, although there are more opportunitiesin the urban area, young people feel stigmatized and ghettoized because “their places”are frequented exclusively by the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transexual, queer (LGBTQ)community. The work will extensively discuss the limitations of the research, futureproposals, and the practical implications of the results.Keywords: LGB, youth, well-being, identity construction, citizenshipINTRODUCTIONThe seminal work of D’Augelli (1994) opened the scientific debate on sexual orientation issues byintroducing significant elements to understand the effects of gender-based stereotypes and socialexclusion. Consequently, hetero-sexism was specifically depicted as a form of oppression, andfurther, in this respect, Harper (2005) highlighted the need to listen to the changing voices of thelesbian, gay, bisexual, transexual, queer (LGBTQ) people in the pursuit of liberation and well-being.The LGBTQ experience has been strongly connected to cultural, social, and legal aspects ofa given area. In many countries in the last half-century (1969–2019) the engagement in theLiberation Movement for LGBTQ citizenship has pursued the imperative of leaving no one behind,Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 787211fpsyg-12-787211 January 12, 2022 Time: 11:52 # 2Agueli et al. Well-Being of LGB Youthachieving basic goals in human rights recognition (Arcidiaconoand Carbone, 2021). Therefore, the disclosure of non-binarysexual orientation and gender identity became a milestone inthe life of LGBTQ youth. However, this experience had differentperspectives in different contexts and social conditions.Hence heterosexism was “defined as an ideological system thatdenies, denigrates, and stigmatizes any non-heterosexual formof behavior, identity, relationship, or community” (Herek, 1990,p. 316). Similar to racism and sexism, heterosexism manifesteditself in two forms: cultural heterosexism (societal customand institution) and psychological heterosexism (individualattitudes and behavior) (Herek, 1990). Therefore. LGBTQ peopledeveloped negative feelings toward their sexual identities as aconsequence of living in a heterosexist society (Amodeo et al.,2018; Bochicchio et al., 2019).Indeed, exposure to heterosexism, homosexual-relateddiscrimination, perceived stigma, or other stressors wereassociated with poorer mental health for sexual minorities.The minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003) postulated thatsexual minorities experience unique stressors related to theirsexual minority identity and negatively impact their health(Scandurra et al., 2020c, 2021). Particularly, the minority stresstheory distinguishes two types of stressors: distal stressors,which are external, such as prejudice or discriminatory events,and proximal stressors, which are internal stressors, negativeinternalized self-experiences such as internalized homophobia ortransphobia, and psychological distress (Meyer, 2003).The acquirement of integral identity had effects on individualand social well-being. Lingiardi and Baiocco (2015) describedtwo connected processes: the building up and the integrationof identity. The first one refers to the development ofawareness about one’s sexual orientation. Meanwhile, thesecond one refers to accepting one’s own identity, resolvinginternalized homophobia, and communicating one’s sexualorientation to others.Several scholars have already highlighted the importance ofadopting an ecological approach in understanding the processesthat explain the construction of identity and sexual orientations(Alderson, 2003; Shilo and Savaya, 2011). The ecologicalapproach considers the close connection of internal individualfactors as well as the interpersonal and territorial factorsinvolved; the ecological model also facilitates the identificationof the factors on which to intervene to improve the conditionsof individual well-being as well as the identity processes(Prilleltensky et al., 2001). Evans and Prilleltensky (2007) addedthat to eliminate any form of oppression and limitation of well-being it is necessary to promote the experience of self-efficacyand self-esteem at an individual level; respect and affirmation ata relational level; and acceptance of diversity and solidarity at thecommunity level.In a study with gay individuals, Fingerhut et al. (2010) arguedthat those who were higher in gay identity expressions reportedhigher levels of psychological well-being. Still, at the same time,gay identity was significantly associated with exposure to boththe distal stressor of discrimination and the proximal stressorof perceived stigma. Therefore, LGBTQ individuals show higherlevels of psychological distress and lower levels of well-being(Everett, 2015; Watson et al., 2018), that is, social isolation andconnectedness affect the well-being of LGBTQ youth (Scandurraet al., 2017; Garcia et al., 2020).However, as a matter of fact, around the world, there are stillspecifically emerging challenges.Connection with the LGBTQ community is an essential factorfor the well-being of sexual minorities as it can buffer the effectsof stigma and oppression that lead to minority stress (Meyer,2003; Frost and Meyer, 2012). In this sense, it is essential torecognize the impact of prejudices during identity developmentand subsequent identification with the minority group (Everett,2015; Scroggs and Vennum, 2020). For this reason, the LGBTQcommunity represents a protective factor toward distal andproximal stressors.The social support of the LGBTQ community is significantas being part of an internal group that understands this specificstressor is a resilience factor (Fingerhut et al., 2010).In this vein, the social support of LGBTQ depends on thephysical and socio-cultural characteristics of the contexts towhich the sexual minority belongs.Contextual variables can affect coming out. Even today, insome contexts, it is common to adopt the principle that Boulden(2001) defined “don’t ask, don’t tell,” an approach whereby, ifsomeone suspects a person’s homosexuality, they do not askdirectly. In case he/she knows for sure, the homosexual personcannot explicitly share information about it. This modality,therefore, translates into the need to keep one’s sexual orientationsecret and, therefore, negatively affects the acceptance processand the subsequent coming out.This particular way of approaching homosexuality is anexample of how hetero-sexism (Herek, 2004) is reflected inthe behavior of communities and therefore contributes to theperpetuation of closure toward sexual minorities and discouragespeople from talking about it, feeding instead, the need toremain invisible.The traditional values of which contexts are bearers anddefenders are very often based on religious beliefs thathave historically condemned homosexual conduct andcontributed to the perpetuation of homophobia. Indeed,religious fundamentalism is closely related to homophobicprejudice. Hence different studies have shown that the basisof negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians is preciselythe system of religious beliefs: many religious denominationsdeny homosexuality and therefore the faithful internalize theseprecepts and take a negative view of homosexuality (Whitley,2009).In these contexts, young people are more likely to experiencesocial isolation and exasperated feelings of loneliness dueto homophobia and pressure to adhere to heteronormativeexpectations (Hubach et al., 2019).This aspect is one of the reasons that very often pushes youngLGBTQ people to move away from their families, from theircommunities, and move to urban areas where they are more likelyto find that support or, more generally, that lifestyle they seek.In the city, it is more likely to find gay communitiesthat encourage encounters; big cities offer more significantopportunities for socialization, anonymity, and sexual partnersFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 787211fpsyg-12-787211 January 12, 2022 Time: 11:52 # 3Agueli et al. Well-Being of LGB Youth(Hubbard, 2012; Procentese and Gatti, 2020). Many studieshighlighted adverse reactions from parents (D’Augelli et al., 1998;Willoughby et al., 2006; Baiocco et al., 2015) or siblings (Hiltonand Szymanski, 2014; Pistella et al., 2020) and family rejectionis investigated as a factor that could threaten the psychophysicalwell-being of young LGBTQ people at an individual level(Newcomb et al., 2019; Scandurra et al., 2020a,b).Therefore, the need to leave their families and relocate meetstheir need to strengthen their acceptance, find support for theiridentity, and form social support networks. In the cities far fromhome, the first sexual experiences and the first step of acceptingone’s sexuality occur (Annes and Redlin, 2012).At first, in most studies, attention has mainly focused onconsidering the areas where sexual minorities are settling thatis, in big cities, in contexts where the homosexual liberationmovement had created the conditions for the settlement of thefirst LGBTQ communities and neighborhoods. Indeed, cities arethe only possible contexts of life for sexual minorities becausethey are “where the modern gay identity is constructed” (LangaritaAdiego, 2020, p. 1349).Moreover, many studies highlighted the need to investigaterural and small town’ sexual minorities because they face moresignificant difficulties due to intense stigmatization (Swank et al.,2012), social exclusion (Waldo et al., 1998), and less access tosupport services (Fisher et al., 2014a,b). Moreover, they appearmost disadvantaged in mental health, social service, and healthcare (Whitehead et al., 2016).Furthermore, literature has amply demonstrated that sexualminorities living in rural areas are more likely to experiencevictimization and discrimination, less identification andengagement with the LGBTQ community, and less social supportreceived (D’Augelli, 2006; Rickard and Yancey, 2018).However, although many studies have focused on urban areasor highlighted the difficult living conditions experienced in ruralcontexts, different studies show that rural areas are not allanti-LGBTQ. Recent work has shown that LGBTQ individualsare out and accepted in rural areas; indeed, gay and lesbianidentities in rural areas are not all closed, hidden, and oppressed(Kazyak, 2011).As highlighted by Kazyak (2016), life experiences in rural areasare different and many people may experience certain conditionssuch as a slower pace of life or close relationships with family andfriends as positive elements that allow them to face isolation andlack of connection with an LGBTQ community.Compared to the rest of the European Union, Italy representsa particular case in terms of LGBTQ issues.Callahan and Loscocco (2021) underline how socio-historicalfactors and social institutions, such as the Catholic Church,the family, and the political system, are among the maincauses of resistance to the inclusion and legitimation of sexualminorities in Italy.The presence of the Vatican on Italian territory represents adeterrent to the possibility of openness toward sexual minoritiesas well as an obstacle to laws that guarantee the rights ofhomosexual couples. Often in Italy, the laws that affect moralityhave gone through negotiations with the Vatican (Moscati, 2010).Moreover, in Italy, according to the most recent FRA report(European Union Agency For Fundamental Rights [FRA], 2019),the LGBT community claims that its living conditions haveworsened due to an increase of prejudice and intolerance and alack of confidence in the real commitment of public institutions.On this basis, the present research aimed to analyze, inan ecological approach, the acceptance and construction ofLGB identity in Italian young people and their well-being,taking into particular consideration the influence of contextualfactors, the territorial community of belonging. Indeed, themain purpose of the study was to highlight the conditions ofdiscrimination perceived by young LGB people in their urbanand rural contexts and how these conditions determine theirperception of well-being. Moreover, the study is the first at anItalian level that considers the role of rural contexts for thewell-being of LGB people.MATERIALS AND METHODSParticipantsThe participants were 30 young LGB people (23 males and7 females), aged 18–35 with a mean age of 25.07 years(SD = 4,578), living in metropolitan and rural areas of southernItaly. Specifically, 15 come from the metropolitan city of Naples(Campania), the third city in Italy by population and one ofthe most densely populated urban areas in Europe, and 15 fromthe province of Foggia (Puglia), a large, geographically extensiveagricultural province, characterized by numerous municipalitieswith a very low population density.Mainly, LGBTQ associations are territorially rooted in Naples,and the city is increasingly becoming a gay-friendly city. TheLGBTQ community can find different reference points to havefun, discuss and participate in cultural events in clubs, bars,squares, and even beaches. In addition, there is the Houseof Cultures and Reception for LGBTQ people in Naples, thecountry’s first emergency municipal residence for LGBTQ peoplewho are victims of discrimination or social marginalization.The situation in Foggia is different. Although many associationsdeal with the rights of sexual minorities and contrast allforms of discrimination, they have a shorter tradition than theNeapolitan realities.Moreover, there are only a few gay clubs in the city andprovince and few places of aggregation and meeting.The interviewees were recruited with a snowball or nominatedsampling (Morse, 2010), considering sexual orientation, place oforigin, and age range (young and young adults). This type ofsampling involves choosing a certain number of individuals withspecific characteristics in line with the research questions andasking them for other names to be interviewed. It is mainly usedin cases where the population is made up of people who tendto hide their identity or are challenging to find, as in this case(Sullivan and Losberg, 2003). The group of participants was builtand then extended using the social network of the participantsthemselves and the researchers.For all participants’ characteristics (see Table 1).Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 787211fpsyg-12-787211 January 12, 2022 Time: 11:52 # 4Agueli et al.

This type of interview is based on adialogical approach, that in the interaction requires some specificcriteria: (a) to let the flow of the interviewee’s thoughts be asfree as possible; (b) to deepen the meanings attributed to theinvestigation topic; (c) to consider the materials that emerge; (d)to explore personal and intimate aspects depicting the experience.It gave interviewees enough freedom to share their lifestories while narrowing down the narrative to specific areas.In this research, the grid of interviews included the followingsites to explore: coming out; interpersonal relationships(families, friends, and partners); relationship with the context;discrimination and bullying; future; needs provided by services.Participants were contacted by telephone, making anappointment with each of them, according to the mostconvenient days and places. In some cases, the participants, inturn, brought with them a friend to interview; the contact, in thiscase, did not take place directly.The interviews took place at the interviewees’ home or, insome cases, at the interviewer’s home and lasted on averagebetween 45 and 90 min.After establishing the first contact with participants, informedconsent was presented to them, explaining the researchobjective in question, the data disclosure methods, respect foranonymity, and the privacy regulations. In the case of anagreed agreement, the interview was carried out. The universityethics committee approved the entire procedure (CERP n.18/2019 del 13/5/2019).Data AnalysisThe interviews collected were transcribed verbatim, subsequentlycombined into a single corpus. Then, textual material wasanalyzed using the Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM)(Corbin and Strauss, 2008; Bryant, 2017; Charmaz and Belgrave,2018), supported by the ATLAS.ti 8.0 software (Muhr, 2017).The data analysis, carried out through a bottom-up approach,involved three coding phases. The first phase (open coding)started with the attribution of code to significant words andsentences; in the second phase (axial coding), the numberof codes was reduced through a criterion of similarity ofmeaning in codes groups and framed in wider macro-categories.Finally, the third stage (selective coding), involved the abstractconceptualization of the data and the identification of the corecategory around which to articulate the complex interpretativemodel of the phenomenon (Corbin and Strauss, 2008).The whole research was conducted by a team of senior andjunior researchers, also composed of researchers belonging to thetwo different contexts. After a first reading of the textual material,the whole research team discussed the codes attributed to thetext (open coding), identifying common and specific conceptualcategories. The coding was then re-discussed with members ofthe local LGB community. The research steps and phases werefollowing the guideline for qualitative research (Critical AppraisalSkills Programme, 2018).RESULTSThe analysis of the textual material resulted in 130 codes,subsequently grouped into 12 categories and five macro-categories: Freedom of identity expression in the urban andrural context, identity construction and acceptance process, needfor aggregation and identification with the LGB community,Role of the interpersonal relationship in the process of identityacceptance, socio-cultural context and LGB psychological well-being.Freedom of Identity Expression in theUrban and Rural ContextThis macro-category collects categories that describe thepeculiarities, the physical and socio-cultural characteristics of thecontexts of belonging, especially the differences between urbanand rural contexts.In urban contexts, there seems to be greater freedom to say:“there is an objective difference because in the city you create yourown space, you have the opportunity of being able to create it, [. . .].In the village you are forced: to go out with people of your age, yourschool friends, or you are forced to do certain things that are goodfor the village: you have to get married, you have to consider beinga man, so there are different laws” (Interviewee 9, M, 25, rural);conversely, in rural contexts, the possibility of being discoveredis more outstanding: “in the small village there is the fear thateverything can get caught and judged respectfully, as opposed to thebig city where you can also find out about things, but still allow youto live more freely” (Interviewee 7, M, 33, rural). Furthermore,in the countryside, the possibility of being the object of pryingFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 787211fpsyg-12-787211 January 12, 2022 Time: 11:52 # 5Agueli et al. Well-Being of LGB Youtheyes is more likely: “I realize that maybe if you walk hand in handwith your boyfriend and walk around the city, they may not giveyou as many strange looks as they do in the country” (Interviewee28, M, 19, urban).The differences are due to a particular socio-cultural conditionthat characterizes the rural contexts, in which emerge closure andintense pressures to conformism: “my village is the classic of thesouth, very closed, very retrograde, very backward, [...] due to acultural background of the people, of their own life” (Interviewee4, M, 25, rural).However, the freedom of expression that characterizes urbancontexts does not represent a large city’s whole area. In fact, inthe case of Naples, there is a distinction between the historiccenter and the suburbs, since the historic center represents themost active part, with a more significant presence of youngpeople and therefore the heart of social life: “in the historic center,since there are many people of our age, one does not make anyproblems, places where perhaps there is more presence of elderlypeople I am also sorry to say that the presence of a political rightparty, however, could cause you a problem also for your physicalsafety, because it is not the first time that a person is also beatenfor a public manifestation of too much affection” (Interviewee18, F, 20, urban).A dimension that has a strong influence in both contexts isreligion. Indeed, participants refer to a level of homophobia,which is legitimized by the Christian creed, which seeshomosexuality as a perversion: “bigotry yes, although perhapsthings are changing, because in the end there are old generationsof people who are truly bigots, and there is always discrimination,you are always afraid of the different person who is not like you;regardless of religion there will always be someone who will notthink so.” (Interviewee 22, M, 20, urban).Finally, university marks a fundamental transition, from highschools, which are a closed and protected ecosystem, to anecosystem open to exchange. The transition from high schoolto university is perceived as a positive event, as participants caninterface with different peers, without fear of being stigmatizedand can be freely themselves: “I enrolled in university, which forme was a moment of strong social knowledge [...] I interfacedwith anyone, and dynamics were also born where I had mydynamic; my dynamic was of an unreported homosexual type, butsimply because I told my friend to my colleague how beautiful thisprofessor is, I never had to justify anything” (Interviewee 29, M, 29,urban). Furthermore, the transition to university often involvesthe transfer from the rural context to the urban one: “The factof enrolling at university and then moving to a big city, to be ableto have independence from my mother, helped me a lot. [. . .] Theenvironment of a big city or, in any case, being distant from yourmother telling you what to do, what not to do, or where to go helpedme to come out” (Interviewee 4, M, 25, rural).Identity Construction and AcceptanceProcessThis macro-category includes categories that refer to the identityconstruction process, the experiences of the young peopleinterviewed, and their needs and prospects. The method ofbuilding one’s identity and the consequent unveiling of one’ssexual orientation turned out to be the result of a series ofintrapsychic and social factors and coming out represents acritical moment that is the last step in the acceptance process.In this process, basic feelings are common in urban andrural contexts. In fact, in both contexts, feelings of diversity,inadequacy, and non-acceptance of one’s sexual orientationemerge. Participants assert that their path of awarenesswas influenced mainly by the diversity and non-acceptanceexperienced in the peer groups “ten years ago there were noassociations, there was no one to help, and you had no guidelines”(Interviewee 10, M, 25, rural), “there were no tools to identify it,and if I, allowed myself to say something like that, that is, that I wasattracted to boys rather than girls, I was seen differently. So, I keptit to myself.” (Interviewee 15, M, 25, rural).It is difficult for young LGB to accept that their attraction istoward their own sex: “It took time because at the beginning I didnot accept this thing [. . .] I do not know, I saw a strange thing, I didnot see myself accepted, maybe” (Interviewee 23, M, 21, urban).Disorientation characterized feelings such as inadequacycompared to the heterosexist cultural model and disadvantage: “Ithought it would be better if I had never been. But for the situation,for the general discrimination of the thing not because I thought itwas a bad thing, just for the easier life I could have. But still, we arewhat we are” (Interviewee 19, F, 21, urban).Therefore, the interviewees claim that they had to go throughtheir own path of personal acceptance, which resulted, in mostcases, in a more or less public coming out.The main difference between the two territorial contexts,therefore, does not concern the process of acceptance andconstruction of one’s own identity but rather the possibility ofrevealing one’s sexual orientation to others or not. Differentintrapsychic and interpersonal variables have influenced thisprocess. The socio-cultural characteristics of the context theybelong to have made finding answers to these questions oftenpainful. In the rural context, young LGB people find it difficult tocome out. For example, in some cases, this ended by perpetuatingthe silence and the need to pretend: “I cleverly pretended to feelattraction towards the boys, and this led me not to live as manyexperiences as I wanted” (Interviewee 6, F, 26, rural).Participants in an urban context, despite managing to publiclydeclare their sexual orientation, believe that having to come outis a kind of discrimination, compared to heterosexuals who donot have to do it publicly and whose orientation is taken forgranted: “I have met many people and the question when you meeta homosexual is: are you out? But do your folks know? And so, Ilearned to answer. [. . .] Still, I’m not saying it so as not to createthe superstructure or the hierarchy; it’s something that comes outspontaneously” (Interviewee 29, M, 29, urban).Moreover, coming out is problematic in terms ofdiscrimination and harassment for women, who also feelmore concern for their physical safety: “it is doubly difficultfor me, because I am a woman and because I am a lesbianand therefore, I have to be careful when I am around with mygirlfriend” (Interviewee 6, F, 26, rural). Therefore, being lesbianis a double minority in a patriarchal context: being women andnon-conforming girls.Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 787211fpsyg-12-787211 January 12, 2022 Time: 11:52 # 6Agueli et al. Well-Being of LGB YouthThe Need for Aggregation andIdentification With the Lesbian, Gay,Bisexual CommunityThe need for aggregation and identification with the LGBcommunity is powerful in both contexts: “when they are thereeven just one of these many people, you feel calm so if you haveto exchange a kiss or a caress you do it” (Interviewee 26, M, 25,urban); “I saw this desire to need to be with someone like me.For example, if a black boy is discriminated against, he goes homeand has a black family or at least one of his parents, so thereis a necessary belonging, always needed, even more so in thosemoments. When I returned home, I had a heterosexual family,that is, I had a family, but I was in dire need of people like me”(Interviewee 10, M, 25, rural).Common to both contexts, the importance of meeting placesfor young people emerges; a supportive community contributesto achieving full awareness of oneself: “it really helps the senseof belonging to someone, of being good for who you are and that’sokay. It helps a lot; it helped me a lot. The sense of belonging waswhat prompted me to come out” (Interviewee 12, M, 22, rural).But a peculiarity of the rural context is the translation of theneed to be part of a group into activism which represents thealternative to remaining isolated and invisible.Indeed, activism represents a strong element of aggregation: “Istarted attending Arcigay, slowly I experienced, I met, I shared mystory with other people and with the fact that I was equally able tolive there without many problems” (Interviewee 15, M, 25, rural).The Role of the InterpersonalRelationship in the Process of IdentityAcceptanceThis collects all categories referring to family, intimaterelationships, and virtual communities.First of all, the family’s reaction to coming out was not alwayspositive in both contexts. In some cases, people who have sufferedviolent reactions move away from the family: “I felt so much angertowards my family, anger that I continue to feel” (Interviewee17, F, 21, urban).Family represents a powerful element of influence sinceparents are carriers of values and traditions: “they reproach mefor not dressing up as a girl, perhaps even before reproaching mefor anything else. They didn’t take my statement well” (Interviewee14, F, 24, rural).But the variables that influence the reactions and theconsequent acceptance of their children’s sexual orientation arenumerous and closely related to the socio-cultural context.Participants from the rural context report their parents’concerns and shame due to the possibility of being judged,criticized, or derided by their fellow citizens: “Then what willothers have to say to me that I have a lesbian daughter?”(Interviewee 6, M, 26, rural).And again: “I cannot accept it, because, in my opinion, it isnot like that, it is just your obsession. Don’t you think about theconsequences of shame [...], the humiliation that we have to suffer,that you have to suffer for a lifetime; at this point, it is better to bealone. If this is to be the case, it is better that you remain alone”(Interviewee 5, M, 27, rural). This statement also informs us onthe beliefs about the origin of homosexuality, which appears to bea whim or something that can be controlled, managed, and, lastbut not least, inhibited.For this reason, mainly in the rural context, participants feelthe need to move away from their family and therefore fromtheir country of origin: “the positive rush I had toward my life,so taking possession of my life was the blessing of this home. It wasessential for me to have a door that closes and opens as I pleased”(Interviewee 3, M, 34, rural).Another participant adds: “When I moved to a city in northernItaly, I was free, quietly. Because I was far from family ties,however, we are well known in the village, this is also what stopsme from unbalancing” (Interviewee 2, M, 32, rural).Secondly, intimate relationships mark an essential stage in theprocess of accepting one’s homosexuality. In this regard, whatemerges as data characterizing the experience of young LGB isan almost total lack of stable relationships common to both ruraland urban contexts. Specifically, in the rural the small numberof inhabitants, (young people in particular) makes it even lesspossible for young homosexuals to meet a potential partner:“The context is important; even this affects me a lot, my love lifeaffects me a lot, here there are no possibilities [. . .] Maybe okay,you can have sex, it ends there, that’s not what I’m looking for,which is something solid, someone you can rely on, a relationship.”(Interviewee 12, M, 22, rural).In the urban context too, there are relational difficulties but, inthis case, they are due to a stereotyped vision of homosexuality: “itis awful because it seems that homosexuals are more promiscuousthan heterosexuals and it is a bad feeling, also because I amnot like that, I seek a stable relationship in my life” (Interviewee17, F, 21, urban).The use of the internet represents for both, urban and ruralLGB youth the preferred tool to “connect” with the rest ofthe LGB community, the privileged means of making newacquaintances. All participants believe that virtual reality plays afundamental role, as they use apps to make love encounters, giventhe limits of meeting places. For example, in the initial phaseof uncertainty about the sexual orientation, they look for same-sex experiences through the web: “I have always had difficulty ingetting involved, let’s say at that sentimental level, and I thought,let’s say it could be a compromise situation, that is, I expose myselfup to a certain point, not in real life, but virtual life” (Interviewee21, M, 21, urban); or they are looking for possible partnerswho would otherwise be difficult to meet precisely because oftheir living in small towns: “I have difficulty meeting someonebecause this is the countryside and it is not easy, because it is notpossible to leave a cafe and find the man of my life” (Interviewee9, M, 25, rural).Socio-Cultural Context and Lesbian,Gay, Bisexual Psychological Well-BeingParticipants internalize prejudice and social stigma, and inthe acceptance phase, their stress level increases exponentially,putting a strain on the psycho-physical well-being of theparticipants: “I said to myself it would be like this all my life, ifthat’s already the case at school imagine then at work, when youFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 787211fpsyg-12-787211 January 12, 2022 Time: 11:52 # 7Agueli et al. Well-Being of LGB Youthhave a family we don’t talk about it just because I couldn’t think ofa family at the time, I felt limited in many things, and it was ugly, soI felt panic” (Interviewee 20, M, 27, urban) or also: “I am unhappyfor other things. I have many mental problems, in the sense that aperson has many hardships in life and my opinion a little related tohomosexuality” (Interviewee 30, M, 30, urban).In particular, the factor, transversal to both contexts andwith a strong impact on the well-being of LGB young people,is internalized homophobia, which represents “the gay person’sdirection of negative social attitudes toward the self ” (Meyer andDean, 1998, p. 161). In its extreme forms, it can lead to therejection of one’s sexual orientation. Internalized homophobiais further characterized by an intrapsychic conflict betweenexperiences of same-sex affection or desire to be heterosexual(Herek, 2004). It, therefore, concerns all the factors that reflect theinfluence that the socio-cultural environment has on the thinkingand behavior of young people.Indeed, participants do not recognize the possibility ofnaturally exchanging gestures of affection with their partnerbecause they feel the discomfort, feel exposed, and judged: “Idon’t like to do it in the public square where it might bothersomeone, that is I would feel it offends them if there is one thingthat bothers me, I avoid doing it” (Interviewee3, M, 34, rural), “Atfirst it was strange for me to walk hand in hand with a man, thatis, it bothered me, then over time I got used to it” (Interviewee30, M, 30, urban).A certain degree of non-acceptance of effeminateness is anindicator of internalized homophobia; respondents describe theneed to remain within limits and not be too excessive in theirbehaviors: “there are too many effeminate people, we are stillmen, and we must remain so” (Interviewee 2, M, 32, rural) aswell as the need not to “flaunt”: “without expressing love fora person of the same sex together. If you are in a place wherethings are accepted, this does not authorize you to exaggerate orexternalize this thing. You can live it naturally, but unfortunately,it does not happen; the vast majority of cases, in the placeswhere this thing is accepted, tend to abuse it” (Interviewee 3,M, 34, rural). It is those who have a negative opinion abouthomosexual people, who show effeminate behavior in public andaccuse them of conducting a bad and deviant image of beinghomosexual: “the worst homophobe is gay, I think that becominga freak phenomenon only makes our situation worse” (Interviewee30, M, 30, urban).Finally, the sentence of a participant about the perceptionhe has of his sexual orientation is significant and reflects thetendency to internalize homophobia: “it’s not the end of the world,I mean. It is a bit like discovering that you have diabetes; one isnot happy with it but lives with it, has a quality of life, an equallife expectancy. Not that I want to assimilate homosexuality to adisease, but surely if I had to express myself, I do not think it isthe most beautiful thing in the world, the most normal thing in theworld.” (Interviewee 3, M, 34, rural).GhettoizationGhettoization is the core category that better expresses thecondition experienced by the interviewees of Italian rural andurban communities as emerged in the categories defined.The term “ghetto” refers to areas within European cities thathad the aim of keeping the Jewish people “in quarantine” andphysically separated from the rest of the population, due to theirdiverse culture (Žižek, 1997). More generally, Hiebert (2009)defines the ghetto as a place where there is a high residentialconcentration of a particular social group (such as Jewish, black,gay, etc.), marginalized by the wider society.Thus “ghettoization” refers to restricting or confining aparticular group to a particular social area or category, andimplies social isolation (Debnath, 2018).In our study, Ghettoization emerged as a commonpsychological condition due to the lack of freedom to expressthemselves and to increase the awareness of one’s own identity aswell as to the sense of isolation caused by the absence of supportof the interpersonal network and the wider context.However, this condition presents different modalities andintensities in the two contexts.While in the rural area one is alone because of lack of placesand people with which to identify and relate to and for thegreater social isolation; in the urban area, although there aremore opportunities, young people are equally stigmatized andghettoized because the places they frequent are exclusive to theLGB community. It is, therefore, a group ghettoization ratherthan an individual one.In the urban context, the vital need for aggregation emerges,even if there is still the risk of feeling ghettoized in exclusivelyhomosexual places. Participants also affirm that the limit ofmeeting places is that they only allow sexual relationships,like the online community. At the same time, they woulddesire to undertake relationships of acquaintance, friendship, andrelationships that result in a proper relationship.Finally, ghettoization seems to have different effects on youngLGB people in the two different contexts. While in the ruralcontext it leads to low personal, interpersonal, and communitywell-being, in the urban context its main consequence is difficultyin participation in the community life (see Figure 1).This study has highlighted how the life context influencesthe process of building a solid identity by inducing unstablesentimental relationships.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONThis study investigated the process of identity acceptance andconstruction and the well-being of young LGB in rural and urbanterritorial communities of South Italy, in an ecological approach.The results lead us to reflect on the close interconnectionof individual, relational, and community dimensions, on LGByoung people’s well-being (Evans and Prilleltensky, 2007).The participants assume that a socio-cultural element thathinders the process of acceptance of their identities in theterritorial communities to which they belong is due to thestrong religious tradition that characterizes Italy. In fact,this factor may indeed negatively affect the well-being ofLGB young people (Higa et al., 2014). Different studies haveshown that the basis of negative attitudes toward gays andlesbians is precisely the system of religious beliefs: manyFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 787211fpsyg-12-787211 January 12, 2022 Time: 11:52 # 8Agueli et al. Well-Being of LGB YouthFIGURE 1 | Core category, ghettoization.religious denominations deny homosexuality and therefore thefaithful internalize these precepts and take a negative viewof homosexuality (Whitley, 2009). Therefore, in Italy, andparticularly, in Southern Italy, which are bearers of strongreligious values and beliefs, the acceptance of homosexuals ismore difficult and heteronormativity is more dominant. Thiscan be explained if we consider religion not only as a culturalbackground but as a real factor capable of shaping a country’sstrategies and policies (Fink, 2009).The relations with the family of origin are undermined byhomosexual choice, respect, and social recognition are alsoharmed. The difficulty of having relationships of respect andrecognition within the family, relational and social circle isevident in all the interviews.Another important result is that for many of the youngpeople interviewed, the university environment, beyond itseducational potential, is transformed into a place of opportunitiesfor relationships and encounters (Carbone et al., 2021) wherethe possibility of experimenting with one’s own identity asgender is facilitated. In this regard, Mitha et al. (2021) researchon LGB exclusion experience stated that “Being geographicallydistanced from his community, by living away from his family andcommunity, facilitated being able to explore his sexuality withoutfear or judgment from others.” (p. 1).To overcome the difficulties caused by the lack of supportreceived from both the territorial and family context,participation in LGB associations responds to the need foraggregation and identification and coming out of the isolationcondition. Therefore, activism offers a chance to break the wallof silence and get out of hiding. Moreover, it will enable actionon governments to promote fairer, more connected, and civicallyengaged societies.Actively participating in LGBTQ associations is configured asa possibility of improving one’s living conditions and legitimizingone’s identity (Nieves-Lugo et al., 2017).Participation in feminist or LGBT activities (Watson et al.,2018) and engaging in activism (Singh et al., 2011) isstrongly associated with wellbeing. Socio-political involvementor community participation increases well-being by facilitatingcommunity connectedness (Prilleltensky, 2005; Gilster, 2012).This is particularly important for young LGB who need socialsupport and identification with their communities to reach anintegrated identity and higher levels of well-being. Studies onLGBT youth suggested that community engagement facilitatesempowerment, which is related to well-being (Wernick et al.,2014; Wagaman, 2016). Although there is strong evidence thatsocio-political involvement can lead to well-being in the generalpopulation, additional research is needed to understand therelationship between LGBT-specific socio-political involvementfor LGBT people.Some important differences emerged in the two territorialcontexts. The rural communities considered are characterized bya lack of support networks and resources for LGB people and thenegative climate toward sexual minorities hinders public comingout and, consequently, also hinders the development of supportnetworks among LGB individuals in rural areas (D’Augelli andHart, 1987). As the research showed, the rural context amplifiesin symbolic terms the concern of being discovered, of not beingable to create one’s own “space” since there is a lack of places ofaggregation and meeting.Moreover, at a relational level, it remains challenging todevelop a relationship free from anxiety, much less if with anotherhomosexual, since he often shares the same fears and anxieties.This situation is reflected in mental states of hopelessness,despair, and self-contempt and in receiving less social andinstitutional support than urban dwellers (Bell and Valentine,1995). The ghettoization experienced in rural contexts, therefore,takes on the connotation of social isolation and occurs whenthe spaces that should provide support to young people (e.g.,families, schools, religious organizations, online platforms) createan atmosphere of rejection, bullying, and stigmatization (Garciaet al., 2020) leaving people alone to themselves.On the other hand, in the urban context of a large townin Southern Italy, although there is a community, someoneFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 787211fpsyg-12-787211 January 12, 2022 Time: 11:52 # 9Agueli et al. Well-Being of LGB Youth“like me,” it is, in any case, a community outside the communityin the broader sense. The difficulty of accessing the broadercommunity generates the perception of ghettoization in theinterviewees belonging to urban contexts.In fact, “LGB neighborhoods,” where people can meet,develop relationships and build communities, social andpolitical spaces to share face-to-face contact (Gieseking, 2016)are created by a homophobic, bi-phobic, and transphobicheterosexual community. Therefore, the areas of homosexualaggregation are experienced as ghettos, in which LGB individualsare confined, and sexuality can be acted out. Still, thereare no opportunities to build relationships and bonds. So,these spaces, despite being associated with community andsecurity, are often associated with segregation and stigmatization(Hubbard et al., 2015).Recently, the new generation of gays and lesbians may findtraditional gay villages limiting, considering them as a historicaland political area no longer relevant for them (Vaccaro, 2009;Nash, 2013). This is due to greater social and political inclusion,in fact, attitudes about homosexuality have changed and LGBTindividuals have become more widely accepted and integratedinto mainstream culture (Gratwick et al., 2014) and this allowedyoung LGBT to be better able to connect with others in differentways which therefore make the gay village superfluous (Usherand Morrison, 2010). In this sense, young LGBT people showa preference for belonging to the community, reducing self-segregation (Hess, 2019).The ghettoization and the consequent social isolation led toa lack of involvement in the enlarged community with strongnegative effects on the well-being of the sexual minority (Higaet al., 2014), also favoring the implementation of risk behaviorsfor the own health, such as suicide attempts and substance abuse(Garcia et al., 2020).However, there are some critical limitations. First, thissituated research considered two specific contexts of SouthItaly: a rural area and a large city. Hence, the participantsonly belong to South Italy and therefore they are notrepresentative of other urban and rural communities in northernand central Italy.Second, the sampling procedure had to deal with recruitingparticipants who fully recognize themselves as being gay, lesbian,or bisexual and who wanted to share their visions with theresearch team. This led specifically to difficulties in recruiting amore significant number of females among the respondents. Thenumber of interviewees is, for the most part, made up of youngmales, all of the same ethnicity.This situated study allowed us to understand the differentimpacts on the well-being of a rural context and an urban one.However, further studies have to develop a better description ofthese contexts. There is a need to understand LGB well-being inother large cities of different national and international contexts.What is LGB life in a large metropolis such as London andNew York or Northern Italy such as Milan? Moreover, what arethe relational features of the countryside to consider? Does livingin the rural area of Foggia have a similar impact, as, say, inLancashire County in the United Kingdom?Finally, the aim of the study was not directed to depictthe transgender experience, but this could also be the goal forfurther investigations.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, our research has highlighted the need tointervene on social, cultural, and relational levels to increasethe inclusive capacity of Italian urban and rural territorialcommunities to promote citizenship rights and equal well-beingopportunities for LGB youth.Well-being for LGB people is closely linked to the possibility ofliving their choices in a context that protects their rights. In fact,for LGB youth, the interdependence of citizenship and personalrights interfaces with personal and collective well-being.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will bemade available by the authors, without undue reservation.ETHICS STATEMENTThe studies involving human participants were reviewed andapproved by the Ethics Committee of the University of NaplesFederico II.

    "abstract": "The study investigates how the territorial community can influence the individual and social well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) youth and especially the recognition of their feelings and the construction of their own identity as well as their needs to be socially recognized. This research focuses on the experiences of 30 LGB individuals (23 males and 7 females), with a mean age of 25.07 years (SD = 4,578), living in urban and rural areas of Southern Italy. Focalized open interviews were conducted, and the Grounded Theory Methodology, supported by the Atlas.ti 8.0 software, was used for data analysis. The textual material was first coded, and then codes were grouped into five macro-categories: Freedom of identity expression in the urban and rural context, identity construction and acceptance process, need of aggregation and identification with the LGB community, role of the interpersonal relationship in the process of identity acceptance, socio-cultural context, and LGB psychological well-being. The results showed a condition common to the two contexts that we can define as “ghettoization.” The young LGB is alone in the rural area due to a lack of places and people to identify with and greater social isolation. On the contrary, although there are more opportunities in the urban area, young people feel stigmatized and ghettoized because “their places” are frequented exclusively by the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transexual, queer (LGBTQ) community. The work will extensively discuss the limitations of the research, future proposals, and the practical implications of the results",
