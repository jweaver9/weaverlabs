Bostock and Contact Theory: How Will a Single U.S. Supreme Court Decision Reduce Prejudice Against LGBTQ People?  MANTAS GRIGOROVICIUS* ABSTRACT In 1954, Gordon Allport, one of the nation’s leading social psychologists, laid out a hypothesis explaining how prejudice could be reduced by intergroup contact. Decades later, his hypothesis became a theory with thousands of research hours behind it. Under contact theory, one of the factors that facilitates a reduction in prejudice between two groups is support of authorities or law. This Comment focuses on Bostock v. Clayton County, a recent Supreme Court decision holding that Title VII prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. Allport suggested that anti-discrimination laws help to “lead and guide the folkways,” and this Comment explores how Bostock could do just that in the context of prejudice. Bostock will allow for more contact with LGBTQ people and, by sending a message that discrimination is not condoned, Bostock can eventually change how society views LGBTQ people. Under contact theory, Bostock’s antidiscrimination protections will establish antiprejudicial societal norms and, as a result, religious groups that show animosity toward nontraditional couples may eventually begin to accept them. INTRODUCTION When President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, few people could have ever imagined that Gorsuch—a conservative picked by a Republican President—would not only side with the members of the LGBTQ1 community but would also author a landmark decision protecting their rights. The Court in Bostock v. Clayton County—decided in the middle of Pride month on June 15, 2020—held that an employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.2 Writing for the majority, Gorsuch emphasized that the decision is limited to Title VII,3 but whether he realized the holding’s implications or not, Bostock is a landmark victory that will have far-reaching, positive consequences for the LGBTQ movement and its fight for equality.  This Comment discusses these far-reaching consequences through the lens of social psychology and contact theory, under which intergroup contact has the          * J.D., May 2021, Indiana University Maurer School of Law.

First, this Comment explains the psychological nature of prejudice and discrimination and their negative effects on society. Next, this Comment discusses Bostock and how the decision effectively creates a universal antidiscrimination agenda that protects LGBTQ people. Then, the Comment discusses the genesis of contact theory and how Bostock will reduce prejudice against LGBTQ people. Finally, the Comment discusses whether the free exercise of religion uncertainties created by the Court will hamper the societal reduction of prejudice against LGBTQ people. I. THE NATURE OF PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION Everyone has an identity.4 When asked, a white, heterosexual, cisgender man might describe his identity as a loving husband and a father of two, while a black, nonbinary person might describe their identity as a reader who likes to delve into the beauty of 17th century British prose. Sometimes, social groups to which people belong help form their individual identities.5 And even though there are similarities that people share, whether through politics, faith, or hobbies, it is the differences between people that often separate them.6 These differences may be challenging for some people to understand and reconcile, which can lead to prejudice.7 Prejudice is a negative feeling or attitude toward someone based on that person’s actual or perceived identity.8 For example, a Red Sox fan might be prejudiced against all Yankees fans just because they are Yankees fans. If that Red Sox fan acted on these negative feelings toward a Yankees fan (for example, by firing a Yankees fan), this action would be discrimination. Thus, when people act on their prejudices, their actions are discriminatory.9 Discrimination can make people feel powerless, especially when they try to access work, education, and other opportunities that people who do not experience discrimination can easily access.10 Even people who do not experience discrimination are negatively affected by it because discrimination has indirect consequences on the entire society, which cannot reach its full potential.11 So, how can a society reduce prejudice and discrimination that certain social groups face? This Comment will answer this question specifically for LGBTQ people. No experience is the same, and the fight for equality and equal rights has    4.

Awareness of homosexuality as the basis for interpersonal relationships in the United States goes back to as early as the 1800s.16 However, unlike heterosexuals, who were able to live freely, most gays were forced to hide their sexual orientation because homosexual behavior was a crime punishable by jail time.17 There was no way for society to accept LGBTQ people because people were afraid to come out.18 The gay rights movement of the 1960s and 70s began the fight for change—the first step was to eliminate the criminalization of homosexual behavior.19 However, the movement had a major setback in 1986 when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Georgia sodomy law.20 Finally, seventeen years after that holding, the LGBTQ rights movement won the battle against criminalization when the Court finally held sodomy laws to be unconstitutional in 2003.21 Lawrence v. Texas was the first, and arguably the most important, step toward the fight for equality and societal acceptance.22 The    12.

II. BOSTOCK V. CLAYTON COUNTY Congress made history when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964—a landmark piece of legislation that was intended to fight discrimination in our society.27 Title VII of the Act makes it “unlawful . . . for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”28 Title VII also protects employees beyond firing and hiring: the statute makes it “unlawful” for employers “to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.”29 Compensation discrimination includes wages, insurance, sick and vacation leave, overtime pay, and retirement programs.30 But what does “sex” mean? Does the Act prohibit discrimination based on someone’s sexual orientation? These are the questions the Court answered in Bostock.   Court’s Historical Treatment of Gay Litigants, 11 WIDENER L.

Three cases were consolidated because they each presented a similar fact pattern: a long-time employee was fired shortly after the employee came out as gay or transgender.31 Gerald Bostock worked as a child welfare advocate in Clayton County, Georgia.32 He was an exceptional employee under whose leadership the county won multiple national awards.33 After ten years of service, he began participating in a gay recreational softball league.34 The county immediately fired him, stating the reason for his termination was “conduct unbecoming of a county employee.”35 The county fired him because he was gay. Donald Zarda worked as a skydiving teacher at Altitude Express, Inc.36 After the company found out that he was gay, it fired him.37 Aimee Stephens, who was born male, worked in a funeral home in Garden City, Michigan.38 When Stephens was hired, Stephens presented as a man.39 However, after two years of service, Stephens informed the funeral home about an intention to “live and work full-time as a woman.”40 The funeral home told Stephens “this is not going to work out,” and fired Stephens.41 All three parties separately sued their employers, arguing that Title VII prohibits unlawful discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.42 After navigating through the court system, all three cases reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which consolidated them to decide whether Title VII prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or transgender status.43 And six justices agreed that it does.  Justice Gorsuch, writing for the majority, looked at the ordinary public meaning of the words comprising Title VII’s protections and held that employers violate Title VII when they intentionally fire an employee because of that employee’s sexual orientation or transgender status.44 Gorsuch explained that discrimination on the basis of homosexuality or transgender status requires the employer to intentionally treat employees differently because of their sex.45 Gorsuch conceded that nobody in the 1960s would have expected Title VII to apply to discrimination against LGBTQ people, but he gave no weight to legislative history because the language of Title VII prohibited the practice.46 Gorsuch provided a simple, yet clear and direct, explanation    31.

Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer’s mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague. Put differently, the employer intentionally singles out an employee to fire based in part on the employee’s sex, and the affected employee’s sex is a but-for cause of his discharge.47  In response to the thirty-three-page majority opinion, Justice Alito exploded in a vehemently opposing fifty-four-page dissent. Alito criticized the majority for trying to “pass off its decision as the inevitable product of the textualist school of statutory interpretation,” while at the same time rebranding Title VII to “better reflect the current values of society.”48 Alito also pointed out the uncertainty of free-exercise-of-religion protections that the decision has created, which is discussed in the last section of this Comment.  Alito bashed Gorsuch for issuing a “radical decision,” for which Gorsuch “should have given some thought to where its decision would lead.”49 But Gorsuch was aware of where the decision would lead.50 So, what does Bostock really mean? Even though the majority explicitly stated that the decision only applies to Title VII,51 the central holding of the case—that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on sexual orientation or transgender status—will undoubtedly impact other laws, including administrative guidance and regulations. For example, in May 2016, the Obama administration issued guidance to public school districts across the nation clarifying and explaining that Title IX, a federal law banning sex discrimination in education programs and activities, unequivocally protects transgender students.52 The guidance was also supplemented by a twenty-five page document detailing acceptable and good practices that should be used to support transgender individuals in schools across the nation.53 The guidance also served as a necessary and powerful tool for transgender students and their families    47.

On June 16, 2021, Biden reversed the administrative guidance back to protecting transgender students,60 and thanks to Bostock, these protections will stay in place.61  Another example of where Bostock would potentially play a role is Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, age, race, national origin, or disability in covered health programs or activities.62 However, the actual words do not appear in the statute’s text; instead, the section refers to other statutes: Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 794 of Title 29, and Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.

Furthermore, in 2012, the Obama administration also promulgated a rule to cover LGBTQ people under the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability.67 Courts have treated definitions of sex under the Fair Housing Act in the same way they have treated definitions of sex under Title VII.68 The Trump administration also tried to eliminate these protections when it proposed a rule limiting definitions of sex to biological sex.69 However, once Biden took office, he immediately rescinded all of Trump’s attempts to reduce protections of LGBTQ people.70 The past several administrations have shown how unstable protections of LGBTQ people can be and how much chaos changing guidance    63.

Finally, the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the government from denying people equal protection under the law.71 When a law is challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment, courts generally apply a rational-basis test, under which the law will be upheld as long as there is a rational reason for the law.72 However, courts apply heightened scrutiny when a law targets suspect classes, such as sex.73 In Craig v. Boren, the Court created the intermediate scrutiny test and applied it to a statute that discriminated on the basis of sex.74 Since then, courts have found that sex is a protected class and any statute that discriminates on the basis of sex must undergo the intermediate scrutiny test.75 Under the test, the challenged statutory classification must be substantially related to an important governmental objective.76 Because discrimination based on sex and discrimination based on sexual orientation have never been held to be the same by the Court, LGBTQ people were not afforded the same level of protection.77 But Bostock is already changing that. Thirty-two days after Bostock was decided, a federal district court, citing Bostock, held that an Idaho law discriminating against transgender people had to overcome intermediate scrutiny because “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being . . . transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”78 Similarly, a Minnesota state court also used the reasoning of Bostock to hold “that requiring a transgender student to use a different locker-room facility because of his sexual orientation is discrimination” under a Minnesota state statute.79 Justice Alito was correct in that “[o]ver 100 federal statutes prohibit discrimination because of sex.”80 And states are also likely to adopt the reasoning of Bostock and protect LGBTQ people at the state level.81 But how will Bostock reduce prejudice against LGBTQ people? How will Bostock lead to more societal acceptance of LGBTQ people? The answers to these questions come from social psychology and contact theory.    71. U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1.  72.

Intergroup contact theory is one of the most extensively researched theories in social psychology.82 The theory has been studied for decades and has a central prediction—contact between members of diverse groups, under certain conditions, reduces prejudice.83 The first examples of this theory can be traced back to white and black seamen during World War II. Ira N. Brophy showed that the more trips white seamen took with black seamen, the more positive their racial attitudes became.84 Similarly, in 1951, sociologists looked at how living in desegregated and segregated areas was related to prejudice, and they found that in places like New York, where housing was desegregated, white participants of the study reported much lower prejudice than their white counterparts in Newark where housing was segregated.85 Several other researchers noticed similar results from other types of contact, but the birth of the theory as we know it today is credited to Gordon Allport and his famous book The Nature of Prejudice, published in 1954.86 Allport’s book is one of the most influential books in social psychology, and many of its ideas and propositions on prejudice are still used today in modern research.87 The most-cited part of the book is Allport’s explanation of how prejudice can be reduced by intergroup contact: Prejudice . . . may be reduced by equal status contact between majority and minority groups in the pursuit of common goals. The effect is greatly enhanced if this contact is sanctioned by institutional supports (i.e., by law, custom or local atmosphere), and provided it is of a sort that leads to the perception of common interests and common humanity between members of the two groups.88 This entire paragraph boils down to four positive factors that facilitate a reduction in prejudice between diverse groups: “(a) equal status within the contact situation, (b) intergroup cooperation, (c) common goals, and (d) the support of authorities, law, or custom.”89 Equal status means that both groups must engage equally in the interaction, and both groups should have similar qualities, backgrounds, and social status.90 Common goals means that effective contact should involve an active effort toward a united goal. For example, every member of an athletic team composed of    82.

First, contact fights prejudice because it reduces feelings of anxiety.94 Second, contact increases empathy and helps others see and analyze things from a different perspective.95 Third, contact changes how people categorize others.96 Finally, contact helps build relationships and friendships.97 The reduction in prejudice can also lead to formation of allyships: the majority group members can work to fight oppression and systemic injustice.98  Many scholars have built on Allport’s work. In 2006, a group of researchers conducted a meta-analysis by reviewing hundreds of previous studies including over 250,000 research subjects.99 The researchers found major support for the theory, and they also found that the results were not affected by self-selection100 as the contact had a positive effect even when the subjects had not chosen whether to have contact with people from other groups.101 The researchers also found that the theory is not limited to racial prejudice—it applies to all marginalized groups.102 In 1988, Gregory M. Herek found that people who report interacting with someone who is gay generally report more positive attitudes toward other gay people.103 Many other    91. Id. at 265.  92.

The establishment of legal norms through antidiscrimination laws cultivates a public conscience and expected standards for behavior that check for overt signs of prejudice.109 Thus, antidiscrimination laws help to “lead and guide the folkways.”110 These laws do not directly control prejudices (because thoughts cannot be controlled), but they control the discriminatory actions.111 And once these actions are controlled, thoughts too are likely to change because “outward action, psychology knows, has an eventual effect upon inner habits of thought and feeling.”112  Finally, Bostock will allow for more contact with LGBTQ people to occur. Before June 2020, there were no federal laws protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination in employment, housing, insurance, military, and other areas.113 All that is changing due to Bostock. The decision will create something that our society has never had before: an equal ground on which people can interact and get to know members of the LGBTQ community. Whether it is a child welfare advocate, a skydiving instructor, or a funeral home employee, Bostock will allow society to meet more LGBTQ people. And that is all it takes—making a difference one person at a time.   Correlates and Gender Differences, 25 J. SEX RSCH. 451, 470 (1988).  104. Sara J. Smith, Amber M. Axelton & Donald A.

IV. WHAT ABOUT RELIGION? Justice Gorsuch acknowledged the difficult dichotomy between religious views and the central holding of Bostock: “[T]he First Amendment can bar the application of employment discrimination laws to claims concerning the employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers.”114 Furthermore, Gorsuch acknowledged the problems presented by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA): “Because RFRA operates as a kind of super statute, displacing the normal operation of other federal laws, it might supersede Title VII’s commands in appropriate cases.”115 But Gorsuch did not explain how RFRA would interact with the central holding of Bostock.  RFRA was enacted to strengthen free exercise protections.116 RFRA prohibits the government from substantially burdening an individual’s exercise of religion, unless the government establishes that burdening the exercise of religion is the least restrictive means of promoting a compelling government interest.117 The Sixth Circuit in Harris Funeral Homes (one of the three cases consolidated by the Court in Bostock) held that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission protecting a transgender employee’s Title VII rights did not substantially burden sincere religious exercise because “tolerating [an employee’s] understanding of her sex and gender identity is not tantamount to supporting it.”118 And that was not the same as endorsing the employee’s transgender status.119 Similarly, the presumed customer biases could not have constituted a substantial burden.120 The Sixth Circuit ultimately held that enforcing Title VII was the least restrictive means of achieving the compelling goal of eliminating workplace discrimination.121  Because the employer in Harris Funeral Homes abandoned its defense based on RFRA, the Sixth Circuit’s opinion will continue to apply in Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio.122 This decision suggests that RFRA may not always shield    114.

People who do not support LGBTQ rights tend to cite religion as their reason for doing so.129 Homosexuality has been denounced by most Christian denominations for centuries, and so naturally people of Christian faith often express animosity toward LGBTQ people.130 The reasoning behind this view is beyond the scope of this Comment. However, over the last few decades, Christianity and many of its denominations have been experiencing a decrease in numbers of people of faith.131    123. Xavier D. Lightfoot & Devon D.

What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered.”138 Those were the words of Pope Francis, who is now calling for unity and inclusivity as the leader of one of the world’s largest religions.139 Many commentators see the Pope’s words as a first official step toward more    132.

For the past several years, Pope Francis had been spending time with LGBTQ people because he wanted to get to know them and their struggles.141 How his attitude has changed toward LGBTQ people is a prime example of what contact theory can do.  Justice Gorsuch acknowledged that religion is another consideration in the Bostock decision.142 And it is unclear how the courts will treat religious exceptions after Bostock.143 Eliminating these exceptions would allow for more contact with LGBTQ people, but even with the exceptions, Bostock will still prompt more contact. People of faith work, and when firing employees for being gay is unlawful, these people will have more opportunities to get to know members of the LGBTQ community. And with more contact leading to more Christian denominations accepting LGBTQ people,144 the RFRA concerns identified in Bostock may eventually become obsolete.  CONCLUSION  Bostock is undoubtedly a milestone in the LGBTQ rights movement. The decision aligns federal employment discrimination law with public opinion data that show strong support for LGBTQ equality in the workplace. Even though the majority in Bostock was explicit that the decision only applies to Title VII, the reasoning of Bostock is already being adopted in other federal and state courts. Because of Bostock, LGBTQ people will finally receive necessary antidiscrimination protections that have been long overdue. These protections, in return, will establish    140.

    "abstract": "In 1954, Gordon Allport, one of the nation’s leading social psychologists, laid out a hypothesis explaining how prejudice could be reduced by intergroup contact. Decades later, his hypothesis became a theory with thousands of research hours behind it. Under contact theory, one of the factors that facilitates a reduction in prejudice between two groups is support of authorities or law. This Comment focuses on Bostock v. Clayton County, a recent Supreme Court decision holding that Title VII prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. Allport suggested that antidiscrimination laws help to “lead and guide the folkways,” and this Comment explores how Bostock could do just that in the context of prejudice. Bostock will allow for more contact with LGBTQ people and, by sending a message that discrimination is not condoned, Bostock can eventually change how society views LGBTQ people. Under contact theory, Bostock’s antidiscrimination protections will establish antiprejudicial societal norms and, as a result, religious groups that show animosity toward nontraditional couples may eventually begin to accept them",
