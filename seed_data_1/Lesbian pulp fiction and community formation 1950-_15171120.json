    "fullText": "Conclusions The definition of community need not adhere to the confines of geographical space. Epistolary contact and  mass-produced publication allowed individuals (lesbians) to be part of a community; though physically separated, print culture allowed for emotionally fulfilling  connections between lesbians to be formed. Through the theories of feminist groups in the 1970s, community has come to mean: a network of individuals who provide emotional guidance and support for others; a group that helps the individual feel less isolated and alone in the face of adversity. This community operates on notions of equality and egalitarian relationships. Using this definition, I will be able to conduct further textual analysis of the portrayal of lesbian community and the characterization of lesbian identity in my primary texts; I will be able to investigate the function of space (or lack of space) in lesbian pulp fiction and other lesbian narratives disseminated in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s.  S Lou Stratton , Dr Danielle Fuller  School of English, Drama, and American and Canadian Studies Compulsory   Heterosexuality  Adrienne Rich’s oft-mentioned article ‘Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence’ (1980) highlights the dire need for feminist theorists to incorporate lesbian experience in their attempts to question and counter-act patriarchy. ‘Compulsory heterosexuality’ not only creates bias within mainstream (or ‘malestream’) sociology, but also inflects feminist theory that questions it. Just as mainstream sociological theory has a history of ignoring feminist theory (Chaftez, 1997), so too does feminist theory have a history of ignoring or misappropriating lesbian experience. Utilising   a   Sociological   Methodology On its own, mainstream sociological thought is inadequate because there is an implicit denial of the lesbian community as a community.  Though foundational to the formation of Sociology, the theories of Comte, Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel are inadequate when describing that which lies outside of normative concepts of gender. An overall focus on the heteropatriarchal family in sociological study, in addition to the influence of Freudian psychoanalysis (Millet 1970) on the sociological schools in the United States, leads to heterosexist definitions of community.  Post-1900 sociological definitions of community become gender-dependent when conceived of mainstream (or male stream) sociological thought. For an examination of lesbian community, a view focused on the image of the 1950s nuclear family would lead to warped interpretations of community structure.  The  Daughters  of  Bilitis  (DOB) The DOB formed in 1955 and published  The Ladder. Historically grouped with male homophile organisations, including the Mattachine Society and One, Inc., the DOB initially sought integrationist strategies, minimising the publicly perceived difference between lesbians and straight women, before allying ‘with the militant segment of the homophile movement’ in the 1960s (Esterberg 1994, pp.426-427). In the context of homosexual and communist persecution of the McCarthy Era (Esterberg 1994 and Schultz 2001) it was perhaps necessary for the DOB to ‘[sacrifice] lesbian sexuality to protect its members’ (Schultz 2001, p.385). While the actions of Homophile  organisations seem lack-lustre in comparison to their successors in the gay civil rights movement, groups like the DOB and their publications show substantial proof of community formation around a readership.   Groups   Formed   After  1960  Radicalesbians (1970-1971): published ‘The Woman Identified Woman’ 1970.  They argued that women (and lesbians) needed to free themselves through looking within the self, and not through internalised male culture. The Furies (1971-1973):  lesbian feminists participating in communal living and worked together. Dissolved due to  difficulties in applying political theory to personal lives.  Redstockings (1969 – Present): radical feminist group. Believe women are an oppressed class; regardless of racial background. Believe male supremacy was the root of all forms of oppression. Women do not need to change, but men do. Cohambee River Collective (1974-1980): Formed partially in response to white feminist groups placing gender oppression ‘above’ racial oppression. Their manifesto, ‘A Black Feminist Statement’,  notes their dedication to working against ‘racial, sexual, heterosexual and class oppression.’ Various images of The Ladder: lesbian periodical published from 1956-1972.

    "abstract": "The study of lesbian pulp fiction is an integral aspect of working against what Adrienne Rich calls ‘Compulsory Heterosexuality.’ Society has a tendency to assume an individual’s identity in heterosexual terms: assuming that a community is comprised of heteropatriarchal family structures. Using alternative definitions of community, my research investigates the formation of lesbian community around the readership of lesbian pulp fiction and lesbian periodicals published between 1950 and 1970. As a proto-political group, the lesbian communities that formed in the United States were able to access a sense of self and community – in part – because of lesbian publications.  \n\n\n\nThrough sociological and historical methods, I investigate both historical communities and the portrayal of lesbian community in genre fiction. In order to do so, I have consulted sociological texts for a working definition of ‘community.’  As these definitions lack cohesion and assume heterosexuality in all members of society, I have consulted the work of lesbian separatist groups in the 1970s. These groups – such as The Furies and Radicalesbians – and feminist sociologists and philosophers produced work that helped to question heteropatriarchal definitions of ‘community.’ While an anachronistic approach, using 1970s feminism and subsequent Queer Theory into a redefinition of community is vital to counteracting compulsory heterosexuality. \n\n\n\nThe objective of my research is to incorporate Queer and Feminist (and ‘queer feminist’) concepts of community and individuality into the analysis of Lesbian Pulp Fiction. While anachronistic to a historical study of 1950s and 1960s lesbian communities, using more contemporary theories would address the role that lesbian pulps once held in lesbian community formation. Moreover contemporary feminist and Queer Theory could figure the analysis of how lesbian pulp fiction is read both inside and outside present-day lesbian communities. \n\n\n\nThus far, I have found that the definition of community need not adhere to the confines of geographical space. Through epistolary contact and  mass-produced publication --lesbians reading pulp fiction and lesbian-produced magazines (such as The Ladder)--allowed for individuals to be part of a community. For the purposes of my study, community has come to mean: a network of individuals who provide emotional guidance and support for others; a group that helps the individual feel less isolated and alone in the face of adversity. Using this definition, I will be able to conduct further textual analysis on the portrayal of lesbian community and the characterization of lesbian identity in my primary texts. Additionally, I will be able to investigate the function of space (or lack of space) in lesbian pulp fiction and other lesbian narrative disseminated during the 1950s and 1960s",
