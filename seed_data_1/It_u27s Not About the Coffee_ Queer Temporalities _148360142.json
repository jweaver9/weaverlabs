The corner of Broadway and \nJunipero roughly marks the center of the gay ghetto and is home to Hot Java “The Community \nCoffeehouse”.  The customers there are loyal and through ethnographic inquiry this paper \nhighlights the importance of Hot Java as a queer site of resistance and community \nbuilding.  Through interviews, observation, and exploration of queer theoretical models of space \nand time, this paper illustrates Hot Java as a queer temporal space marked by trauma, \nresistance, and community building. \t\r  \nThe city, a densely populated urban location, is one that is marked by its shared geography \namong different populations with various cultural commitments and attachments.  \nNeighborhoods, or small sections of cities are often created to house communities that share \ncultural ties with one another.  “Gayborhoods”, urban areas where “gay people are or appear to \nbe the majority of visitors and residents” are found in many cities within the United States \n(Reuter 1).  David Higgs explains, “Queer city histories attract a readership because gay men are \nintensely urban.  Few live by choice in the country on a permanent basis since they usually feel \nthat cities offer a much greater variety of ways in which to enjoy one’s life” (Higgs 2).  One such \ngayborhood is located in Long Beach California.\t\r  \n Long Beach California is located in southern Los Angeles County and is home to almost \n500,000 people, making it among the 40 largest cities in the nation (U.S. Census).  Long Beach \nis known for being a “gay friendly2” city and as such is home to a number of LGBTQ3 residents, \nmany of whom call Long Beach’s “gay ghetto”4 home.  The gay ghetto is a stretch of Broadway \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  1 The Los Angeles Times refers to the “gay ghetto” as an “affectionately named neighborhood, less nightlife-\noriented than West Hollywood.”\t\r  2 Websites like www.gaycities.com describe, “most of Long Beach is as gay-friendly as it is sunny.” \t\r  3 LGBTQ, throughout this paper, refers to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer.\t\r  4 “The gay ghetto” or less commonly “The Gayto” is a common name used to describe the neighborhood that is \nhome to a number of LGBTQ residents.  However, due to the stigma of the word “Ghetto” some residents have \nbegun referring to the area as the “Gayborhood.”\t\r  \n1\nDavis: It's Not About the Coffee: Queer Temporalities at a Community Coffeehouse\nDavis 2 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \nfrom Alamitos Avenue to just beyond Redondo Avenue including a few blocks north and south \nthat features bars, coffee shops, and businesses that cater to the LGBTQ population.  It is a \ndensely populated area that includes a generous mix of single-family homes, small and large \napartment buildings, businesses and a range of apartments that are, compared to nearby \nneighborhoods, “affordably” priced.  Though there are no distinct lines drawn, the Gay and \nLesbian center on 4th Street is said to mark the north border of the gay ghetto.  \t\r  \n Contemporary understandings of space and time help to shape our social and political \nformation.  Geographies are filled with “politics and ideology” and as such gayborhoods such as \nthe gay ghetto are also established via politics (Keith & Pile 4).  Feminist theorist bell hooks5 \ndefines an alternative spaciality of “radical openness” (hooks 1991, 149).  hooks explains:\t\r  \t\r  \nOur living depends on our ability to conceptualize alternatives, often \nimpoverished.  Theorizing about this experience aesthetically, critically is an \nagenda for radical cultural practice.  For me this space of radical openness is a \nmargin- a profound edge.  Locating oneself there is difficult yet necessary.  It is \nnot a ‘safe’ place.  One is always at risk.  One needs a community of resistance \n(149). \t\r  \nThe gay ghetto is a “community of resistance” and is a visible marker highlighting the very real \npast, present and future of the LGBTQ community.  As a neighborhood with a geographical \nboundary it establishes the LGBTQ community as a fixture of the larger city of Long Beach.\t\r  \n The corner of Broadway and Junipero Avenue roughly marks the center of the gay ghetto \nand is home to Hot Java “The Community Coffeehouse”.6  Two gay-identified men opened the \ncoffeehouse in 1991, and although it has changed ownership over time, it has always been owned \nand operated by “out” LGBTQ people.  The customers are loyal and through ethnographic \ninquiry I will highlight the importance of Hot Java as a queer site of resistance and community \nbuilding.  Through interviews, observation and explorations of queer theoretical models of space \nand time, I aim to highlight Hot Java as a queer temporal space that is marked by trauma, \nresistance and community building. \t\r  \t\r  \nSite Description and Explanation of Methodology\t\r  \n Hot Java, “The Community Coffeehouse” serves as the site of interest in this \nethnographic exploration.  The coffeehouse is a two thousand square foot space that seats ninety-\nsix customers inside and thirty-two outside.  Hot Java currently occupies the corner of Broadway \nand Junipero, though it used to be positioned one store front down before it was remodeled and \nexpanded.  Located within the Broadway corridor, the site of most of the LGBTQ-owned and \nfrequented businesses, Hot Java’s customer base is roughly 70% LGBTQ identified (Jeff, 7 Oct \n2011).  While there are a number of bars catering to the LGBTQ population there are only two \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  5\t\r  bell hooks is the pen name of author Bell Hooks. \t\r  6 “The Community Coffeehouse is part of the Hot Java brand name and as such it is written prominently on the \nawning outside of the storefront. \t\r  \n2\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 2 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol2/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201301.09\nDavis 3 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \ncoffeehouses within the confines of the gay ghetto, consistently identified 7  as “gay \ncoffeehouses.”8  Hot Java is the only one, out of those two, that is owned by gay-identified \npeople.  While gay bars have historically been the focus of much research within LGBTQ \npopulations as locations of resistance and community building, I chose to focus on Hot Java in \norder to examine a location that allowed for diversity in age, sex, gender, religion, and economic \nclass.9  Since it is a coffeehouse it is open to anyone regardless of age and since it does not serve \nalcohol it allows for a different experience amongst its patrons.  Coffee is more affordable than \nalcohol and can be refilled for fifty cents, meaning someone can spend hours at a coffeehouse for \na fraction of the cost of spending time in a bar.  Alternatively, coffeehouses serve as a location \nfor those that have had issues with alcohol as a place to congregate and socialize without the \ntemptation or presence of alcohol.  Personally, as a queer-identified woman, I was interested to \nunderstand what drew other people to the “gay coffeehouse.”  In my own life, it was gay \ncoffeehouses, not bars that played an important role in my coming out experience as well as in \nthe formation of the queer social circles I now frequent.  Gay coffeehouses were places I could \ngo at eighteen years old and meet other LGBTQ identified people.  It was at a gay coffeehouse \nthat I met my partner of nearly ten years and met and/or got to know better most of the close \nfriends I have in my life.\t\r  \n This research was conducted across a three-month span in the fall of 2011.  The majority \nof my work involved participant observation and interviews.  I conducted three one-on-one \nformal interviews with customers, one formal interview with an employee, and one formal \ninterview with one of the owners of Hot Java.  Due to the political climate surrounding sexual \norientation I have decided to change all participants’ names in order to secure their safety and \nprivacy.  All participants were informed of the research I was doing and were recorded with their \nwritten consent.  \t\r  \n My characterization, analysis, and choice of research sites is no doubt informed by my \nstatus as a queer-identified woman living in Long Beach.  I have patronized Hot Java for about \nten years and am on a first name basis with the owners and a number of the customers.  While \nthis directly affects the outcomes of my research, I think in large part it has a positive impact.  \nFirst and foremost I was able to conduct in-depth participant observations without signaling to \nthose within the site that I was doing so.  Second, as a longtime patron of the coffeehouse, the \nowners were assured that my intentions were positive and were not intended to harm their \nbusiness in any way.  Third, as a queer woman I was able to conduct longer and more in-depth \nand personal interviews with my participants without eliciting fear that I would intentionally \ndamage their stories in any way or reveal their identities.  As an insider I was able to gain access \nto a more authentic version of the community within the “community coffeehouse.”  For the sake \nof transparency, I have included myself in this project so as to highlight my involvement and the \ndirect impact it has had on my research.

Lillian Faderman and Stuart \nTimmons explain this in their book Gay L.A.: A History of Sexual Outlaws, Power Politics, and \nLipstick Lesbians, “As historians and lovers of that city, we wondered how such a history could \nhave been discounted or left un-commemorated, and we grew determined to fill in what we \nconsidered a huge gap in the record of lesbian and gay America” (Faderman and Timmons 2009, \n3).  Recuperative historical methods set out to fill in the gaps of history for those left out of the \narchive in order to gesture toward a more positive future of inclusion.  It is precisely this fear of \nforgetting that Andreas Huyssen addresses in his book Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a \nCulture of Amnesia.  Huyssen explains, “As we approach the end of the twentieth century and \nwith it the end of the millennium, our gaze turns backwards ever more frequently in an attempt to \ntake stock and to assess where we stand in the course of time” (Huyssen 1995, 1).  Huyssen’s \nbook highlights the obsession with memory as illustrated by the popularity of museums and \n4\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 2 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol2/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201301.09\nDavis 5 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \nmonuments.  However, this crisis over forgetting can also be applied to the history of those in the \nmargins.  Sitting outside of Hot Java one warm fall afternoon, I discussed the history of the area \nsurrounding Hot Java with Daniel, a 33-year-old gay man who visits Hot Java daily.  He \nexplained that he knew there was a history to the area, but that he did not know the specifics:\t\r  \t\r  \nI mean, I know there were a lot of arrests in this area, and probably still are.  I \nheard once that the reason that there are so many gays in this neighborhood is \nbecause of the port and the Navy.  Those navy men were kicked out for being gay \nand they settled here because this is just where they were.  I don’t know if I \nbelieve that, but it is kind of a cool story.  I wish I knew more about the area and \nhow we all ended up here.  I guess it would make me feel better to know how far \nwe’ve come.” (Daniel, 3 October 2011)\t\r  \t\r  \nDaniel seeks solace in the progress narrative.  That is, Daniel’s desire is to learn the trauma of \nthe past so that the present as well as the future seem more positive. \t\r  \n Daniel’s desire to uncover the trauma of the past in order to march toward a more \npositive future is similar to what Elizabeth Freeman describes as “homogenous empty time.”  \nFreeman explains that homogeneous empty time is that which takes its meaning “from, and \ncontributes to, a vision of time as seamless, unified, and moving forward” (Freeman 2010, xxii).  \nHomogeneous empty time describes that which functions based around progressive and forward \ndawning markers of time (e.g. development, domesticity, marriage, reproduction, etc.).  Similar \nto homogeneous empty time, Freeman introduces the concept of “chronormativity” or “the \ninterlocking temporal schemes necessary for genealogies of descent” (Freeman 2010, xxii).  This \nwould mean that in order to write the history of the gay ghetto within Long Beach, one would \nneed to start with the past and show progress into the present to imagine a more positive future.  \nHowever, this model requires a vision of time that is “seamless, unified, and forward moving” \n(xxii).  The idea of “forward moving” time requires a commonly held understanding of what \nprogress means.  This is troubling in that it measures progress based on a unitary version of \nidentity and it is assumes that the present is always better than the past.  This excludes allowance \nfor differences in race, class, gender or sexuality.  For LGBTQ populations, progress is generally \ndefined based on legal rights, laws and visibility.  One of my participants, Jack a twenty-six year \nold butch10 explains that this version of progress does not always work:\t\r  \t\r  \nI guess for most of the world progress for gays and lesbians would mean access to \nmarriage rights, adoption rights, greater acceptance in general society, less \nviolence and just generally more tolerance.  But for me, I guess, I don’t really see \nmyself getting married or playing that whole game.  So I’m not sure how you’d \nmeasure progress for me. (Jack, 30 September 2011)\t\r  \nJack’s narrative does not fit neatly in a uniform definition of progress.\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  10\t\r  Jack is female-bodied and identifies his gender as ‘butch.’  He prefers male pronouns and performs a queer \nversion of masculinity.\t\r  \n5\nDavis: It's Not About the Coffee: Queer Temporalities at a Community Coffeehouse\nDavis 6 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \nLooking back on the history of Long Beach it would be easy to construct a \nchrononormative archive of the gay ghetto.  That is to look for the trauma of the past and mark \n“progress” into the present.  In 1914 Long Beach began campaigning to rid itself of “social \nvagrants” who had infiltrated the city.  This included the arrests of thirty men and the publishing \nof their photos and names in all of the newspapers in California.  Lilian Faderman explains, “the \narrests of these men unleashed a tsunami of homophobia in the newspapers that described the \nrelationships among them as ‘a holocaust of vice’ and the men themselves as ‘social vagrants’ \n(Faderman and Timmons 2009, 30).  Long Beach wanted to do what it could to rid itself of any \nsocial deviance.  The November 15, 1914 Los Angeles Times article titled “Takes His Life \nThrough Shame,” details the suicide of John A. Lamb.  They explain that the, “banker and \nprominent churchman […] ended his life […] on the rocks near Point Firmin as a result of the \nexpose of a clique of “social vagrants” that has shaken this city of its very foundations” (“Takes \nHis Life”).  The article further details the temporary ban on the “sale of all poisons as the result \nof an attempt by another citizen implicated to buy carbolic acid” (“Takes His Life”).  Lamb’s \nsuicide note details the trauma experienced by men accused of “social vagrancy” in Long Beach \nat the time.  He writes: “My darling sister: God knows, and will have mercy, through Christ.  I \nam crazed by reading the paper this morning.  I never knew of such a place, or of such orgies.  I \nam innocent but the victim of a situation.  I could not endure this publicity as I had not a chance \nto deny it” [sic] (“Takes His Life”).  Lamb served as a reminder that Long Beach wanted to do \nwhat it could to rid the city of any “social deviance”.\t\r  \nHowever, looking to the present moment, in 2011, Long Beach just hosted its annual \n“Long Beach Lesbian and Gay Pride” event.  The event drew 80,000 participants making it the \nthird largest gay pride celebration in the United States (LBLGP).  Looking back to 1914 from the \npresent moment one could argue that progress has been achieved.  From the pain of the past \ncomes more acceptance and visibility; the past has helped to shape the future.  Sitting at Hot Java \non any given day one is bound to see the rainbow flags decorating the windows, two men \nembracing in a public kiss, or a group of lesbians playing a game of cards on a very busy street.  \nIn this linear model, the past becomes something that has already happened, something that is no \nlonger a part of the present.  However, Hot Java is a location that relies upon simultaneous \nhistories and interweaving spaces.  While Hot Java is a “community coffeehouse” that has been a \npresence in the neighborhood for twenty years, it stands in the exact location at which men \nincluding Herbert N. Lowe were arrested for “having unnatural tendencies” which caused them \nto “make advances to other men” (“LB Uncovers “Social Vagrant” Clan”).  Thirty men were \narrested in 1914, but of course, they were not the last to be arrested in this location.  Jeff, one of \nthe owners of Hot Java, explains some other arrests that have happened in the area:\t\r  \t\r  \nSome of the guys that hang out here in the morning used to be a part of the flower \nbrigade.  When the guys would get arrested in the park for cruising, they’d show \nup to the jail with flowers for them when they got out.  There’s been a long \nhistory of arrests in this neighborhood.  Thankfully not as much anymore (Jeff, 7 \nOct 2011). \t\r  \n6\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 2 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol2/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201301.09\nDavis 7 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \nThe customers of Hot Java are deeply imbedded in the trauma of the past and the present.  From \nthe flower brigade to protests and marches, the trauma serves as a painful reminder of the \nimportance of a space such as Hot Java.\t\r  \n Judith Halberstam describes queer temporality as that which “disrupts the normative \nnarratives of time” (Halberstam 2005, 152).  She explains that queer uses of time and space \ndevelop, at least in part, in opposition to the institutions of family, heterosexuality, and \nreproduction.  They also develop according to logics of location, movement, and identification \n(152).  For my participants, Hot Java stands as a location that resists normative institutions of \nheterosexuality, family, gender, sex, etc.  Hot Java is an escape from those normative \ninstitutions.  Daniel explains, “For me it’s nice to be able to not talk about straight relationships \nall the time.  I mean that’s all that’s all over the media, so it’s nice to get to talk to other gay \ncouples and hear what their lives are like.  I find it very refreshing” (Daniel, 7 Oct 2011).\t\r  \nHot Java disrupts the normative narratives of time and allows for a discussion that challenges \ndominant ideologies.  For Daniel that exists in the alternate conversations he sees possible only \nin a location such as Hot Java.\t\r  \n Jeff explains the current status of Hot Java as “welcoming and inclusive,” though he \nadmits that “even in the Gayborhood we still have our issues” (Jeff, 7 October 2011).  I asked \nJeff if anything had ever happened at Hot Java to leave him feeling unsettled.  He explained,\t\r  \t\r  \nOf course, we’ve had eggs thrown at customers, vandalism on the walls: Someone \nspray painted, “Don’t Eat Here, Jeff has AIDS” and I’m not HIV positive, but \neven still it was a horrible thing to have spray painted on the building.  We have \nincidences of eggs being thrown, a lot of drive-bys of people being called faggots \nor other derogatory names just by being associated here.  I think it’s also that we \nare pushing people’s comfortability.  The fact that gay marriage is moving \nforward and DADT11 has been over turned is causing people to react.  But in \nsome ways it’s a good thing.  It’s still not Nirvana, we still have work to do. [sic] \n(Jeff, 7 October 2011) \t\r  \nFor Jeff, the trauma of the present is an important part of community building.  The screaming \nthat comes from cars and the eggs that are thrown bond the patrons of Hot Java together and \nremind them that the trauma of the past is alive in the present moment.  Jeff illuminates this: “In \nsome way, I hate to say this, I think sometimes the screams that come from the cars, and the eggs \nthat get thrown remind us [the LGBTQ community] that we have to keep fighting” (Jeff, 7 \nOctober 2011).  While legislative gains are being made, the trauma brought on by vandalism and \nshouting reminds the patrons of Hot Java that they are still living on the margins.\t\r  \n While Hot Java builds a visible presence of LGBTQ bodies it does so in opposition to \ndominant ideologies that might allow for a more permissive view of homosexuality, provided it \nstay hidden and not quite as visible.  Aaron Betsky explains:\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  11 DADT stands in here for “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.” Jeff referred to the policy by its acronym.\t\r  \n7\nDavis: It's Not About the Coffee: Queer Temporalities at a Community Coffeehouse\nDavis 8 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \nQueers are supposed to be in the closet. You might say that queer space is born in \nthe closet.  What is the closet? It is the ultimate interior, the place where \ninteriority starts.  It is a dark space at the heart of the home.  It is not a place \nwhere you live, but where you store the clothes in which you appear.  It contains \nthe building blocks of your social constructions, such as your clothes.  The closet \ncontains the disused pieces of your past.  It is a place to hide, to create worlds for \nyourself out of the past and for the future in a secure environment […] Being in \nthe closet means that you surround yourself with the emblems of your past and \nwith the clothes you can wear, while covering yourself in darkness. (Betsky 1997, \n16-17) \t\r  \nHot Java challenges the concept of the closet.  It provides a socially visible setting that allows \ncustomers to gather based on sexual orientation and to create a sense of social life and cultural \ncapital.  The visibility of queer bodies at Hot Java challenges normative ideologies of gender and \nsexuality.  Although some of the customers at Hot Java might live “in the closet” while at work \nor school, while they are at Hot Java they are “out” by association.  As such, while sitting at Hot \nJava studying or conversing with friends, it is probable that one will hear someone shout \nsomething derogatory from a car window sometime throughout the evening.  While most of the \ntime customers ignore it, on rare occasions the tension is addressed head on.  Daniel explains \nwhat happens when that challenge is most visible:\t\r  \t\r  \nJust, like, a week ago these guys drove by in this big van and screamed \n“FAGGOTS” really loud.  And, you know, we all usually just sit back and shake \nour heads or something.  Well, one of the guys who works here, apparently just \nwasn’t having it that night.  He hopped on his motorcycle and road up the street \nand chased after them.  He pulled the guy out of his van and pushed him against \nthe wall.  Everyone down here at the coffeehouse could hear him screaming like a \nlittle girl [the man in the van].  He didn’t hit him or anything, but I bet that guy \nwill never do that again.  The guy who works here came back and shook his head \nand just said ‘I shouldn’t have pulled him out of the van’.  It was pretty great. \n(Daniel, 21 Oct 2011)\t\r  \nWhile this type of resistance might be rare at Hot Java, a different type of resistance emerges \ndaily.  \t\r  \nResistance Through Coffee\t\r  \n Though the slurs keep getting shouted and the eggs are continually thrown, each day \nmore LGBTQ identified people return to Hot Java.  The solidarity felt amongst the customers of \nHot Java seems to drive the feeling of safety that most participants described while being at Hot \nJava.  This feeling of solidarity and community allows customers to continue sitting at Hot Java, \ndespite the stigmatization being pushed via the larger community.  Hot Java serves as a visible \nsite of resistance for the LGBTQ community.  Unlike the gay bars in the neighborhood, the \nnature of Hot Java allows its patrons to remain extremely visible, even while inside.  The corner \n8\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 2 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol2/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201301.09\nDavis 9 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \non which Hot Java is located on is a very busy one, and often during my interviews we had to \npause to wait for the sound of the traffic to quiet.  The front of Hot Java is made up of giant \nwindows that open in the summer time to allow a breeze to enter the space.  The tables outside \nallow patrons to sit in the fresh air and interact with the community outside of the coffeehouse.  \nThe store hours, 6 a.m. – 10 p.m. during the week and 6 a.m. – 11 p.m. on the weekends mean \nthat there is a queer presence even in the daylight, as opposed to gay bars, which are only open at \nnight.  This is quite different than most of the windowless gay bars in the neighborhood, Hot \nJava is alive all day long.\t\r  \n Hot Java serves a diverse population of people, though Jeff, one of the owners of Hot \nJava identifies approximates that 70% of their business comes directly from LGBTQ identified \npeople (Jeff, 7 Oct 2011).  Another participant puts the percentage at closer to 85%.  Daniel, a \n33-year-old gay man explains:\t\r  \t\r  \nI would definitely classify this as a gay coffeehouse.  It used to be that all of the \nemployees and the owners were gay.  Then 85 percent of the clientele are gay and \nif they’re not they’re extremely comfortable with gay people or prefer gay people, \nso it’s pretty much geared for that. (Daniel, 3 Oct 2011) \t\r  \nWhile there is not a sign outside signaling that Hot Java is a gay coffeehouse, patrons of the shop \nhave no problem identifying it as such.  Daniel explains, “I mean straight people come here, it’s \nnot as if they aren’t welcome, but this place is definitely gay” (Daniel, 3 October 2011).  Jeff, the \nowner of Hot Java explains that the space is coded, though unintentionally, so that LGBTQ \nidentified people know they are in a welcoming establishment.  He explains, “We have the small \nrainbow flags in the windows, we have the gay rags [magazines] out and we have the equality \nboard with news from the community.  But a straight couple coming in off the street might not \nnotice.  I think there is insider knowledge that codes this space” (Jeff, 7 Oct 2011).  During the \nsummer a big rainbow flag flies outside of the coffeehouse, and Jeff explains that it would fly all \nyear if it were not so expensive to maintain.  \t\r  \n Hot Java is a political site of resistance in a number of ways.  From political organizing, \ncommunity building, sharing news and discussing ideas pertinent to the queer community, Hot \nJava serves a lot more than coffee.  Jeff explains that Hot Java is:\t\r  \t\r  \nPolitical because of the ideas and the conversations that are shared.  We have the \narticles posted on the “Equality Board” which is a way we can get things out that \nare important to the community.  It started organically from my employees \nsurrounding Prop 812  The Prop 8 rally that happened originated here with a text \nmessage.  It was a rally after the vote that approved Prop 8; it was a way to direct \nthe anger at the results of Prop 8.  Right after that we were all sitting out here and \nwe said ‘let’s get together and have a candle light vigil’.  Then it went viral, from \ntext messages to Facebook.  I mean my sister called me and said, ‘I see the top of \nHot Java from Cairo Egypt on CNN,’ and it all started here. (Jeff, 7 Oct 2011)\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  12 Proposition 8 “Eliminates Rights of Same-Sex Couples to Marry” was a ballot initiative in the November 2008 \nCalifornia Election.  It passed, overturning the rights of same-sex couples to marry.\t\r  \n9\nDavis: It's Not About the Coffee: Queer Temporalities at a Community Coffeehouse\nDavis 10 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \nAll of my correspondents discussed Proposition 8 in regards to Hot Java being a political site.  \nThey all remembered sitting at Hot Java throughout the campaign and discussing the election.  \nMost of them had been approached by “No on 8”13 organizers while at Hot Java to volunteer for \nthe campaign.  After the 2008 election and the victory for “Yes on 8,” all of my participants \nremembered the organizing of the march/rally to protest the election results.  Molly, a thirty-six-\nyear-old queer identified woman explains:\t\r  \t\r  \nI don’t even want to get married, but I knew it was important to get involved in \nthe protest movement after the vote came down.  We marched from Hot Java \nthrough downtown and back again.  That was the organized part of the march that \nstarted here.  But after everyone got back here, people weren’t done yet.  They \ntook over the streets and moved the march even further.  Hot Java was the place \nthat all that was organized at. (Molly, 9 Oct 2011).\t\r  \nOne of my participants, Jack, was an organizer for the No-on-8 campaign and explained that Hot \nJava was one of the known locations they could always count on to find supportive volunteers.  \nJack explains, “Hot Java is always the go-to place for anything LGBTQ related in Long Beach.  \nIf you need volunteers for something, signatures, etc.  Hot Java is a consistent gold mine” (Jack, \n30 September 2011).  While Hot Java is traditionally political in that it is an organizing ground \nfor LGBTQ related legislation, awareness, and support, it also serves an alternate political \npurpose as well.  Molly explains:\t\r  \t\r  \nJust having this many queer bodies together in one place is a political act.  I mean \nthere’s something really powerful about the transgression of heteronormativity \ngoing on in a site like this.  It’s not like a bar where the music is turned up too \nloud for people to talk.  Instead, at Hot Java, it’s set up for people to talk.  I have \nhad some of the best political conversations here, discussing queer theory, gender \ntheory, politics, etc.  There’s something very powerful in occupying a space that \ntransgresses gender norms like that (Molly, 9 Oct 2011).\t\r  \nSuch power comes from the feeling of possibility of political action, social interaction and shared \nexperience.  Hot Java is a place to shed feelings of isolation, make a friend, find a date, or even \ntake one.\t\r  \nQueering Community: It’s Not About the Coffee\t\r  \n In a day and age where there is a Starbucks on every corner and independent businesses \nare having a difficult time competing with larger corporations, Hot Java stands out as a local \nbusiness.  All of my participants began their introduction to the LGBTQ social scene through the \ngay coffeehouse The Library, located just one mile from Hot Java on Broadway.  Jeff, the owner \nof Hot Java explains that when he first moved to Long Beach in 1991 he went to The Library \nevery night.  In fact, it was The Library that kept him in Long Beach and made it his home.  He \nexplains:\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  13 “No on 8” was the side in support of same-sex marriage.\t\r  \n10\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 2 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol2/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201301.09\nDavis 11 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \n\t\r  \nThe weather, the community, actually Hot Java.  Well, at first it was The Library.  \nI was there every night with my partner at the time.  I knew everybody there, I’d \nget off work and go there and sit down and talk to people.  It was the place to be \nback in the nineties, it was just a great place to be.  The Library, and eventually \nHot Java made Long Beach my home.  (Jeff, 7 Oct 2011)\t\r  \nAll of my participants made the transition from The Library to Hot Java for political reasons.  \nThe Library went through a series of owner changes, but the biggest change was back in the \nearly nineties when one of the original gay owners of The Library died due to complications \nfrom AIDS.  Jeff marks this as the turning point for him and explains why he could no longer go \nto The Library:\t\r  \t\r  \nI know exactly why I stopped going there.  When one of the original owners died, \nan out gay man died of HIV/AIDS.  His family told people that he died of cancer.  \nI felt very betrayed by them that they couldn’t tell people that he passed away \nfrom HIV/AIDS and I couldn’t support it anymore.  I thought it was beneath him, \nI thought they cared more about the business and what it might mean to people to \nhear that he died of AIDS.  I stopped going and started coming here to Hot Java. \n(Jeff, 7 Oct 2011)\t\r  \nAll of my participants explained that it was not the coffee that drew them to Hot Java.  Much like \nJeff’s transition from The Library to Hot Java, all of my participants explained that the openly \ngay owners of Hot Java are the number one reason they support the business.  Jack transitioned \nfrom The Library to Hot Java because he “wanted to support local gay businesses,” and “knew a \nlot of people who spent time at Hot Java” (Jack, 30 Sept 2011).  Jack spends at least three nights \na week at Hot Java but does not actually enjoy the coffee.  Jack explains, “I do not like the coffee \nat Hot Java.  I’ve spent time at another coffee shop but I never felt as comfortable there.  It’s a \ncommunity coffeehouse too, but more like a Long Beach community thing.  They have better \ncoffee for sure, and are very LGBT friendly but it is definitely not a primarily gay space.  I feel \nmore comfortable around a lot of gays (Jack, 30 Sept 2011).  The sense of community that the \nloyal customers of Hot Java feel is the thing that seems to drive them back to Hot Java again and \nagain.  None of my participants view Hot Java as a place to stop in and grab a coffee to go.  They \nall cite the experience of being at Hot Java as the reason for being there.  Daniel, who lives a \nshort walking distance from Hot Java, explains his reasons for going to Hot Java:\t\r  \t\r  \nI almost never grab a cup of coffee and go.  I could make it at home; I have a \nKeurig [coffee maker].  So if I was going to do that, I’d just make it at home.  \nWhen I come here in the morning I come down and I chat with the older guys \nwho hang out here.  In the evening I usually come because I’ve been working all \nday at home and need an escape.  I always know that I will run into someone I \nknow.  Sometimes I bring work here, or will come down here if I am stuck on \nsomething I am working on.  I know if I am stuck one of my coffee shop friends \n11\nDavis: It's Not About the Coffee: Queer Temporalities at a Community Coffeehouse\nDavis 12 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \nwill stop by, and every time they inspire me to the point I need to get to.  Every \ntime I am here I run into people I know.  I love it. (Daniel, 3 Oct 2011)\t\r  \nAll of my participants believe that Hot Java lives up to its “Community Coffeehouse” signage.  \nThe sign came from a previous owner of Hot Java, but was purposeful in its use.  Under previous \nownership, Hot Java was simply known as “The Community Coffeehouse” at least in print.  \nCustomers referred to it as Hot Java, but the cups and signs stated otherwise.  The current owners \nkept the name because they felt it was important to mark Hot Java as a place for community \nbuilding and engagement. I asked Jeff if he thought that, as business owners, they lived up to the \nname and to describe what he thinks a community coffeehouse is.  He answered:\t\r  \t\r  \nI hope so, I think there’s a lot of things: Being very out and open as the owners as \nbeing gay identified, gives it a sense of legitimacy in the queer community.  We \nvolunteer and give our time to the community and people see that. Our employees \nare a mixture of gay and straight but everyone is open minded and welcoming.  \nMy customers know that my employees are accepting of everybody and have no \nissues or hang-ups.  But yes, I think we do live up to our name. (Jeff, 7 Oct 2011)\t\r  \nThroughout my interviews it seemed that the definition of “community” went even deeper than \nJeff would admit.  Daniel passionately defended the community status of Hot Java and \nexplained:\t\r  \t\r  \nThe owners are so involved in the PRIDE festival and that makes this sort of the \nhub of everything.  You have people coming in who don’t necessarily live right \nhere, meetings and all that.  The owners do a lot in the community.  The other \nthing is, if you tell the owner Jeff ‘I am doing x, y and z’ he will pull out the \nrolodex and pull out the numbers to get things done.  He can literally help you \nwith anything and he will.  I can’t tell you how many times he gave me a number \nto help me with something. (Daniel, 3 October 2011) \t\r  \t\r  \nThe customers of Hot Java are passionate about their relationships with one another and with the \nowners of Hot Java.  They are particularly fond of Jeff and no one had anything negative to say \nabout his involvement in the LGBTQ community.  Every participant mentioned a relationship (or \ntwo) that had been formed at a ‘gay coffeehouse.’  Daniel met his best friend at a gay \ncoffeehouse and finds the coffeehouse to be a much bigger driving force toward community \nbuilding:\t\r  \t\r  \nI met my best friend at The Library coffeehouse.  I went up to her because I \nthought she was someone else.  As I got close I realized I didn’t know her so I \nwalked away.  The next day she came up to me and said ‘You’re an asshole.’  I \nsaid ‘I thought you were someone else.’  We’ve been best friends ever since and \nwe’ll be friends for life.  I have made so many connections here [at Hot Java].  \nIt’s so nice to go to a place where people know you and it isn’t all about straight \npeople and their issues.  Here we can talk about politics, it’s really neat.  You can \nbe around people that are like-minded, there’s no time pressure and you can see \n12\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 2 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol2/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201301.09\nDavis 13 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \npeople you know at any moment…even more so than being at a bar. (Daniel, 3 \nOct 2011)\t\r  \nAaron Betsky in his book Queer Space: Architecture and Same-Sex Desire examines the \nimportance of queer space.  He explains, “Queers continue to queer our cities, our suburbs, and \nnow our exurbs because they must, as they continue to redefine who we are as individuals, as \nbodies, as part of a society.  They continue to restage the promise that we can make ourselves by \nmaking a place for ourselves” (Betsky 1997, 14).  Hot Java is an example of this queer space.  \nThrough the work of the customers, as well as the owners (previous and current), Hot Java has \nbecome an important aspect of community building.\t\r  \n I asked each of my participants what the awning outside of Hot Java marking it as “A \nCommunity Coffeehouse” meant to them.  While everyone believed it directly related to the \nLGBTQ community, some thought it might also have to do with the Long Beach community in \ngeneral.  However, one point that continually came up was the idea of family.  “I mean, \ncommunity to me means an extended family,” Mark explained (Mark, 7 Oct 2011).  The idea and \nrole of family is a long-standing one within the LGBTQ community.  In fact, “family” has long \nbeen a term that LGBTQ people would identify one another.  One might say, “She’s family” to \nsignal that the other person was also a lesbian.  However, the feeling of family seems to come to \nthe forefront of Hot Java’s community.  Jeff explains this:\t\r  \t\r  \nFor a lot of people, when they come out [of the closet], their families betray them \nand they’re isolated.  I want Hot Java to be the place that those folks can go.  \nThat’s why we’ve always been open on the holidays.  It works on a volunteer \nsystem, I always allow my employees to have the choice to work or not.  I always \nwork it though, that’s a given.  But, I keep the doors open for those customers that \ndon’t have a family to go to.  For a lot of us, this is our family.  All of my closest \nfriends I have I met here, they are my family. (Jeff, 7 Oct 2011) \t\r  \nThe relationships built and maintained at Hot Java go deeper than relationships amongst casual \nacquaintances, and according to Mark, that’s purposeful: “We have to create relationships like \nthat, family type relationships.  Who else is going to have our back?  Who else understands what \nit is like to live like we do?” (Mark, 7 Oct 2011).  For Mark, the family relationships he has built \nat Hot Java help to negotiate life on the margins.\t\r  \nDiscussion of Results\t\r  \n While sitting at Hot Java one evening, I began talking to another customer, a young \nwoman in her early twenties.  We were discussing the closure of a neighborhood lesbian bar and \nwhat it meant for the community.  She was adamant that it closed because lesbians did not need \nspaces like that anymore, that we had made enough legal strides and places like the gay ghetto \nwere just not as needed.  My research proves otherwise.  Hot Java is a “community of resistance” \nthat builds itself through acknowledgement of the trauma of the past (and present), through \nresistance to dominant ideologies and retaliation, as well as through the building of familial \nrelationships.  \t\r  \n13\nDavis: It's Not About the Coffee: Queer Temporalities at a Community Coffeehouse\nDavis 14 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \n It should be apparent that for the customers of Hot Java, the desire to spend time and \nmoney at Hot Java is quite clearly “not about the coffee,” and instead is an important extension \nof their being.  As a part of the gay ghetto, a neighborhood with a geographical boundary, Hot \nJava establishes the LGBTQ community as a fixture within the larger city of Long Beach.  In the \nwords of Daniel, “Of course places like this are still important.  I live in this city because of \nplaces like this; I love being able to surround myself with other gay people.  It’s powerful, now \nthat I really stop to think about it, it’s revolutionary” (Daniel, 7 Oct 2011).\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n14\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 2 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol2/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201301.09\nDavis 15 \n\t\r  \nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Volume 2 \n© Claremont University Consortium, December 2012  |  http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/ \t\r  \nReference List\t\r  \nBetsky, Aaron.

    "abstract": "Long Beach California’s “gay ghetto” 1 is a loosely defined neighborhood with bars, coffeehouses and businesses that cater to the LGBTQ community. The corner of Broadway and Junipero roughly marks the center of the gay ghetto and is home to Hot Java “The Community Coffeehouse”. The customers there are loyal and through ethnographic inquiry this paper highlights the importance of Hot Java as a queer site of resistance and community building. Through interviews, observation, and exploration of queer theoretical models of space and time, this paper illustrates Hot Java as a queer temporal space marked by trauma, resistance, and community building",
