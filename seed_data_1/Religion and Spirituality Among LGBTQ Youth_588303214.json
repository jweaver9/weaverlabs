    "fullText": "Religion and Spirituality Among LGBTQ YouthDecember 2022BackgroundReligion and spirituality play important roles in the lives of many Americans. Overall, 68% of young adultsages 18\u000029 in the United States report that they believe in God, and 30% report that they believe God hearspeople’s prayers and can intervene (Jones, 2022\u0000. Numerous studies have documented the ways thatreligion and spirituality are associated with positive mental health and healthy development amongadolescents, including prosocial behavior and be er physical health (Hardy et al., 2019; Canda et al., 2019;Koenig, 2018; Smith & Denton, 2005; Yonker et al., 2012; Nadal et al., 2018\u0000. Despite this, religion andspirituality can be fraught topics among LGBTQ communities due to historical anti-LGBTQ sentimentsamong many religious groups. Religious dogma has been used to dehumanize LGBTQ people, and LGBTQpeople have often been excluded from religious spaces, ceremonies, and communities (Sherkat, 2019;Taylor & Cuthbert, 2019\u0000. While some American religious communities are shifting toward a irming andcelebrating their LGBTQ members (Barton & Currier, 2019; Rodriguez & Etengo , 2016\u0000, significant stridesremain to ensure LGBTQ inclusion in many religious communities and spaces. Perhaps due to this historicalexclusion and dehumanization, religion and spirituality have mixed associations with mental health amongLGBTQ youth and adults. While, LGBQ young adults who report that religion is important to them also reporthigher odds of recent suicidal ideation (Lytle et al., 2018\u0000, LGB adults who report that they left their religiondue to conflict with their sexual identity report higher odds of a empting suicide, compared to their peerswho had no conflict between their faith and sexuality (Gibbs et al., 2015\u0000, suggesting the mental healthimpact is related to how they are treated in these spaces. Historical conflicts between religiouscommunities and LGBTQ people have created a common misperception that LGBTQ people cannot bereligious or spiritual. Using data from The Trevor Project’s 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth MentalHealth, this brief sheds light on the importance of religion and spirituality in the lives of LGBTQ youth.ResultsOne in five \u000021%) LGBTQ youth reported thattheir religion or spirituality is important orvery important to them. LGBTQ youth ages18\u000024 \u000026%) reported higher rates of theirreligion or spirituality being important or veryimportant to them, compared to LGBTQ youthages 13\u000017 \u000019%). LGBTQ youth who reportedjust meeting or struggling to meet their basiceconomic needs \u000025%) reported higher ratesof their religion or spirituality being importantor very important to them, compared to their| 1peers whose basic needs were more than met \u000021%). LGBTQ youth in the South \u000023%) reported the highestrates of their religion or spirituality being important or very important to them, compared to their peers inthe Midwest \u000022%), Northeast \u000021%), and West \u000021%). Native and Indigenous LGBTQ youth \u000034%) reportedthe highest rates of their religion or spirituality being important or very important to them, followed byMiddle Eastern / Northern African youth \u000033%), Black youth \u000027%), Multiracial youth \u000024%), White youth\u000021%), Latinx youth \u000020%), and Asian American / Pacific Islander youth \u000019%). These findings are similar toThe Trevor Project’s previously published researchbrief on religiosity.Nearly one in four \u000023%) LGBTQ youth reportedengaging in prayer, meditation, or privatereflection on their religion on at least a weeklyor daily basis. When asked about prayer,meditation, and private reflection frequency, 44%of LGBTQ youth reported that they never do it, 33%reported that they do it monthly or less, 16%reported that they do it weekly, and 8% reportedthat they do it daily. Rates of prayer, meditation,and reflection were higher among LGBTQ youthwho reported that their religion or spirituality isimportant or very important to them. AmongLGBTQ youth who reported thatreligion/spirituality is important or veryimportant to them, only 4% reported that theynever pray, meditate, or reflect, and 70%reported that they do so on a weekly basis ormore.LGBTQ youth who reported that their religionor spirituality is important or very importantto them reported significantly lower rates ofsymptoms of depression \u000055%), compared totheir peers for whom religion and spiritualitywere not at all or only a li le important \u000058%).LGBTQ youth reported similar rates of recentanxiety and suicidality, whether theyconsidered their religion or spirituality to beimportant or not.| 2MethodsData were collected from an online survey conducted between September and December 2021 of 33,993LGBTQ youth recruited via targeted ads on social media. Youth were asked, “How important is yourreligion/spirituality to you?” Response options included: 1\u0000 Not at all important; 2\u0000 A li le important, 3\u0000Important, and 4\u0000 Very important. This variable was re-coded into two groups: 1\u0000 respondents who selectednot at all important and a li le important, and 2\u0000 respondents who selected important or very important.Youth were also asked, “How often, if ever, do you pray, meditate, or reflect on your religion, by yourselfalone?” Response options included: 1\u0000 Never, 2\u0000 Less than once a month, 3\u0000 One to two times a month, 4\u0000About once a week, 5\u0000 A few times a week, 6\u0000 About once a day, and 7\u0000 Many times a day. This variable wasre-coded into four groups: 1\u0000 respondents who selected never, 2\u0000 respondents who selected less thanonce a month or one to two times a month, 3\u0000 respondents who selected about once a week or a few timesa week, and 4\u0000 respondents who selected about once a day or many times a day. Recent anxiety wasassessed using the GAD-2 (Plummer et al., 2016\u0000, and recent depression was assessed using the PHQ(Richardson et al., 2010\u0000. Items measuring seriously considering and a empting suicide in the past 12months were taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey(Johns et al., 2020\u0000. Chi-square tests were used to examine di erences between groups.Looking AheadThese findings suggest that religion and spirituality are important to many LGBTQ youth in the U.S. One infive LGBTQ youth reported that their religion or spirituality is important or very important to them, andnearly one in four reported that they pray, meditate, or reflect on their faith at least weekly. Demographicdi erences were observed: LGBTQ youth over age 18, those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, andthose living in the South all reported higher rates of their religion or spirituality being important to themcompared to their peers. Native/ Indigenous youth and Middle Eastern/Northern African youth reported thehighest rates of religion or spirituality being important to them compared to other racial/ethnic groups.Among LGBTQ youth who reported that their religion or spirituality is important to them, 70% reportedpraying, meditating, or reflecting on their faith weekly or daily. Unlike previous studies with LGBTQ youngadults (Lytle et al., 2018; Gibbs et al., 2015\u0000, no significant relationship between the importance of religionand spirituality and suicidal ideation or a empts was observed. That said, LGBTQ youth who reported thattheir religion or spirituality is important to them reported slightly lower rates of recent depressioncompared to their peers for whom religion and spirituality were not important. These findings suggest thatthe relationship between religious and spiritual importance and mental health is mixed and requires moreresearch, but may also not be as harmful as it is often perceived.It is important to note that this survey did not ask young people which religion or spirituality they practiced.Di erences in rates of importance and mental health impact across di erent faith communities or practiceswere unable to be examined. Given the wide diversity of religious practices in the United States, futureresearch should examine religious a iliations among LGBTQ youth. It is also possible that youth in thissample reported rates of meditation, which is not necessarily religious in intention, but rather a secular| 3practice often used to address mental health symptoms. It is also important to note that these data reflectLGBTQ youth’s own reported religious importance and spirituality and not that of their parents/caregivers,which may have di erent associations with mental health (The Trevor Project, 2020\u0000.Nonetheless, these findings paint an important picture of religion and spirituality among LGBTQ youth.They demonstrate that LGBTQ youth may be interested in participating in a irming religious communities.To that end, religious leaders must work to make sure that their congregations and communities are safeand a irming spaces for LGBTQ members. Denominations seeking to become more LGBTQ- inclusive shouldconsider how their language and messaging may alienate LGBTQ people – which includes ending theharmful practice of conversion therapy, ensure that LGBTQ people are able to fully participate in thecommunity, and work directly with LGBTQ young people and organizations to be er understand how bestto support them.At The Trevor Project, we are dedicated to improving support for all LGBTQ young people. Our public trainingteam is commi ed to training professionals and organizations – including faith-based organizations – thatare in direct contact with LGBTQ youth to be more accepting of their identities. The Trevor Project alsooperates TrevorSpace, a safe space social networking site, as a way for LGBTQ youth to connect withsupportive peers, and our advocacy team works to advance LGBTQ-inclusive policies. For youth who mayfind themselves in crisis, Trevor o ers 24/7 crisis services that are available via phone, chat, and text.Finally, The Trevor Project’s research team will continue to examine all LGBTQ youth, and how the di erentaspects of their identities intersect to paint a holistic picture of who they are and the challenges they face.ReferencesBarton, B., & Currier, A. \u00002019\u0000.
