Exploring Polyamorous Relationship Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and PansexualIndividualsA dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor ofPhilosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University.byJiale Man, M.S. June 2023Director: Dr. Naomi Wheeler, Associate Professor, Department of Counseling and SpecialEducationVirginia Commonwealth UniversityRichmond, VirginiaJune 20232AcknowledgmentsIt all started with an innocent joke I learned through my mom’s memory. She used to tellme that as a toddler, I would burst out “I wanna have a wife” whenever my neighboring adultsteased me about my dream of the future. Every time, my grandma would correct me and let merepeat after her “I wanna go to college.” Growing up in a working-class family in the 1990s in arural town of China, my dream was actually more achievable than my grandma’s. Yet, the ironyis I ended up pursuing a Ph.D. degree at a U.S. university without a wife. I do, though, have ahusband, whom I love deeply and dearly. Regardless of a million moments that have happenedsince my toddlerhood leading to my current academic trajectory, I do believe my longing andpassion for love guided me to eventually choose polyamory as my dissertation study.It has been a long journey since the finalization of my dissertation topic. Movies aroundthe world, Apple Fitness+, pop music, hot pot, and podcasts, have reminded me of the beauty inthe world when I was distressed or frustrated. More importantly, I have received tremendoussupport and wisdom from different people in my life to complete the dissertation. I forever owemy gratitude to the late Dr. Vivian Lee. You saw my strength and resilience and believed in mymaturity and ability to pursue a doctoral degree. You supported and guided me throughout theapplication process. You have influenced me to always hold my counselor identity to my heart,and to show kindness, love, and care in this chaotic world. I cannot appreciate my dissertationcommittee chair Dr. Naomi Wheeler enough for her endless guidance, support, patience,encouragement, and feedback throughout the dissertation process. I would not be able to finishmy dissertation without your mentorship. I will also miss our weekly meetings where we ignoredour agendas and philosophized various “random” topics. In addition, I want to thank the rest ofmy dissertation committee. Dr. Philip Gnilka, your wisdom on research and academia will3always guide me as I am navigating my future career as a scholar and educator. Dr. DonnaDockery, your unconditional support and passion for education will motivate me to devotemyself to the field of counselor education. Dr. David Naff, your feedback and suggestions willcontinue to help me to develop my ability and skills in future qualitative inquiries. I alsoappreciate other faculty members, including Dr. Abigail Conley, Dr. Mary Hermann, and Dr.Kaprea Johnson for their guidance as I grew to be a counselor educator and researcher.I am privileged to receive personal and professional support from my amazing cohort,especially Amber Livingston and Bisola Duiyile. Our little triad has given me so muchempowerment and motivation to continue my Ph.D. and dissertation journey. I am fortunate to besurrounded by all of you who are breaking the glass ceiling in different ways.I want to express my special gratitude to my family. I am grateful for having my momwho loves and supports me through her actions. Her toughness and resilience have been acontinuous source of inspiration for me to move forward with my life. Dad, I was in luck toabsorb your wisdom of living a life with integrity and honesty and defying authoritarianism. Myfriends in China and U.S., who are my chosen family, your encouragement and belief in me havegiven me the strength to beat all odds in a foreign country.Last but not least, my deepest gratitude to my husband, Xiaoming Shi, the love of mylife. For 15 years, you have stood by me through highs and lows. Your unconditional love andsupport not only help me grow in my ability to love but also give me the freedom to pursue mydreams in academics. Whenever I look into the future, I feel safe and secure as I picture you bymy side.4Table of ContentsAcknowledgements 2Abstracts 8CHAPTER ONE: Introduction 10CNM and Polyamory 10Attitudes Toward CNM and Polyamory 12CNM and Polyamorous Relationship Quality 15Relevance to Counseling 18The Current Study 20Key Definitions 25CHAPTER TWO: Review of Literature 26Consensual Non-Monogamy 26Prevalence of CNM 28Attitude Toward CNM 31Consensual Non-Monogamy and Sexual Orientation 36Polyamory 38Polyamorous Relationship Structures 40Polyamorous Experiences 42Relationship Quality 46Minority Stress Model 49Process of Minority Stress for Nonheterosexuality 51Process of Minority Stress for Polyamory 53Minority Stress for Nonheterosexuality and Polyamory 555Resilience and Minority Stress 58Summary 61CHAPTER THREE: Methods 63Positionality 63Theoretical Framework 66Rationale for Utilizing Minority Stress Model 67Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis 69Phenomenology 70Hermeneutics 72Idiography 73Rationale for Utilizing Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis 74Research Procedure 75Recruitment 75Research Participants 76Data Collection and Analysis 78Data Collection 78Data Analysis 81Validity and Quality of Study 86Ethical Considerations 90CHAPTER FOUR: ResultsParticipants 92Group Experiential Themes and Sub-Themes 95GET One: Polyamory Is an Evolving and Purposeful Journey 966GET Two: Poly Satisfaction Is a Systemic Experience 112GET Three: Dynamic Interplay of Sense of Self 126and Interpersonal ExperiencesGET Four: Interwoven Personal, Relational, 154and Systemic ChallengesGET Five: Ecological Systems for Relationship Maintenance 183Conclusion 207CHAPTER FIVE: Discussion 208Interpretation of Findings 208Minority Stress in Polyamory 208Minority Resilience in Polyamory 217Implications for Counseling 223Ethical Considerations in Practice 224Case Conseptualization 225Poly Affirmative Counseling 227Counselor Education and Preparation 230Directions for Future Research 231Limitations 233Conclusion 235References 237Appendix A: Research Recruitment Email 262Appendix B: Research Flyer 265Appendix C: LGBP Polyamorist Experience Interview Protocol 2667Appendix D: Participant Information Sheet 269Appendix E: Mental Health Resources 2738AbstractPolyamory is a type of relationship under the consensual non-monogamy relationshipumbrella that assumes the possibility, validity, and worthwhileness of maintaining romantic,sexual, and intimate relationships with multiple people simultaneously. In Western society, theprevalence and domination of mononormativity have led to the marginalization of relationshipsalternative to monogamy (i.e., polyamory). As a result, individuals in polyamorous relationshipscontinue to experience bias, stigma, and discrimination at varying levels. With a rise in publicinterest in CNM in the past two decades, scientists and researchers have slowly started toexamine various topics related to CNM, including its prevalence, public attitudes toward CNM,and CNM relationship quality. However, empirical research designated to investigatepolyamorous relationships is lacking, let alone polyamorous relationships of sexually minoritizedpopulations. Therefore, the current qualitative study investigates the polyamorous relationshipexperiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals. Utilizing InterpretativePhenomenological Analysis, the current study explored the minority stress and resilience ofpolyamorous relationship experiences of 14 participants. Five group experiential themes wereconstructed based on the convergence of participants’ experiences, including (1) polyamory is anevolving and purposeful journey, (2) poly satisfaction is a systemic experience, (3) dynamicinterplay of sense of self and interpersonal experiences, (4) interwoven personal, relational, andsystemic challenges, and (5) ecological systems for relationship maintenance. Overall,participants utilized personal, relational, and community resources to build strengths, skills, andresilience to address challenges that come within and outside of their polyamorous relationships.Implications for counseling practice, counselor education, and recommendations for future9research are discussed, with a focus on developing multicultural and social justice counselingcompetencies for counselors to work with clients in polyamorous relationships.Keywords: Polyamory, LGBTQ+, relationship experiences, IPA, minority stress, minorityresilience10Chapter One: IntroductionMonogamy naturalized in Western culture contributes to the devaluation andsubordination of alternatives to monogamy (Anderson, 2010). Consequently, individuals who arein consensually non-monogamous (CNM) relationships face bias and discrimination in theUnited States due to their alternative relationship orientation (Conley et al., 2013a; Balzarini etal., 2018; Matsick et al., 2014. Moors et al., 2013). In general, CNM relationship structuresinclude but are not limited to, open relationships, swing, polyamory, and monogamishrelationships (Hamilton, et al., 2021; LaSala, 2004; Parson et al., 2012). Each form of CNM isdistinct in terms of the typical relational dynamics and boundaries inferred. For example,polyamory (the focus of the current study) refers to the multiple short- or long-term extra-dyadicrelationships that can be intimate, sexual, and/or romantic (Hamilton et al., 2021; Taormino,2008). Research suggests that intensified attention to CNM as internet searches of the terms“open relationship” and “polyamory” have been rising in public between 2006 and 2015 (Moors,2017). In the U.S., approximately 4%-5% of adults report being in a subtype of CNMrelationships (e.g., polyamory) and about 20% of single adults report previous experience inCNM relationships in their lifetime (Fairbrother et al., 2019; Haupert et al., 2017; Levine et al.,2018; Rubin et al., 2014). In theory, the number of CNM relationships may be underestimateddue to the concealment of relationship status in the face of anti-CNM stigmas (Conley et al.,2013a). It is plausible to assume that a fair number of U.S. adults experience or identify withCNM in spite of social bias toward non-monogamous relationship structures. Therefore, thecurrent study aims to explore the relationship experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, andpansexual individuals in polyamorous relationships.CNM and Polyamory11Unlike some other forms of CNM relationships (e.g., open relationships, swinging) thatmainly emphasize sexual aspects of multi-partnered relationships, polyamory assumes thepossibility, validity, and worthwhileness of maintaining “intimate, sexual, and/or lovingrelationships with more than one person” (Haritaworn et al., 2006, p518). Existing literaturesuggests that individuals who have sexual/affectional- and/or gender-expansive identities aremore likely to engage in polyamory compared to their heterosexual counterparts (Balzarini et al.,2019; Haupert et al., 2017; Moor et al., 2014). It is possible that because of a long history ofqueer oppression for alternative identities, individuals in the queer community are inclined toexplore alternative relationship configurations rather than conforming to mainstreamheteronormativity in society.To date, the estimate of the prevalence of polyamorous relationships in the U.S. remainsunknown due to a lack of research, not to mention that of polyamorous relationships amongindividuals identifying as nonheterosexual. In addition, the scarcity of research on polyamorycontributed to the knowledge gap in polyamorous relationships and the factors that influencerelationship experiences in a multi-partnership (i.e., Balzarini et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2014;Moors et al., 2021). Few scholars have shed light on the negative influences of the minoritystress non-heterosexual individuals( e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual) in polyamorousrelationships live with on personal and relational well-being (e.g., Moors et al., 2021;Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). Yet, less is known about the polyamorous relationshipexperiences of non-heterosexual individuals to inform counselors to support the mental healthand relational well-being of this population. Given that most models of relationship counselingwere developed on heteronormative and mononormative ideas (e.g., marriage and couples12counseling), a need exists to incorporate the polyamorous relationship experiences ofnonheterosexual individuals to enhance queer and poly affirmative counseling services.Attitudes Toward CNM and PolyamoryCNM, including polyamory, is not well accepted in Western culture, probably due to itsviolation of the norms of monogamy and a perceived threat to monogamy (Moors. et al., 2013).Individuals who are in CNM relationships are often perceived as immoral, unfaithful,promiscuous, and sexually riskier (Balzarini et al., 2018; Moors et al., 2013). Moors et al. (2013)also found a “halo” effect around monogamy based on arbitrary qualities (e.g., a cognitive biaswhere respondents rated monogamous targets as being more likely to engage in unrelatedbehaviors such as flossing their teeth daily) and relationship-related behaviors such as perceivedratings as less likely to use condoms. Moors et al. (2013) hypothesized that less condom use maybe perceived as a higher level of sexual intimacy and trust between couples among monogamouscouples who do not engage in extra-dyadic sexual activities. Findings for a mononormative biasare consistent with the perception of individuals in CNM relationships being lonelier, lesssexually satisfied, and having lower relationship quality (Moors et al., 2013). Furthermore, inone European study, respondents rated the extent CNM partners experience secondary emotionslike happiness, love, guilt, or embarrassment significantly lower than in monogamous romanticrelationships (Rodrigues et al., 2018). The authors theorized that the different perceptions inemotion-based attribution reflect the dehumanization process common within societies biasedagainst CNM to favor monogamy.In addition, the levels of negativity seem to differ based on the CNM subtypes (e.g.,polyamorous relationships, swinging, open relationships). For example, polyamory is rated morefavorable than both swinging and open relationships (Matsick et al., 2014). Survey respondents13perceived polyamorists as more moral, more motivated by duty than by pleasure, and lessself-oriented than swingers and those in open relationships. One plausible explanation for thereported differences in public perceptions is that polyamory violates fewer monogamous normsbecause it involves social and emotional intimacy, which is typically absent in swing and openrelationships. The involvement of social and emotional intimacy in polyamory may also explainthe negative attitudes swingers toward polyamory because it still upholds aspects ofmononormativity. Conversely, those in polyamorous relationships perceived swingers as dirtier,emotionally unavailable, and more sexually risky, which is similar to the perception of thegeneral public (Balzarini et al., 2018). In general, monogamy, Christianity, and politicalconservatism predict negative attitudes toward CNM (Conley et al., 2013a; Balzarini et al., 2018;Hutzler et al., 2016; Matsick et al., 2014. Moors et al., 2013). Therefore, biases andmisperceptions towards CNM exist not only within the community but also in the larger society.Furthermore, attitudes toward CNM also seem to differ based on one individual’spersonality trait, attachment style, and socio-sexual orientation (also called sociosexuality whichrefers to the openness to engage in casual sex; Kinsey et al., 1948). An avoidant attachment styleis associated with a more positive attitude toward CNM and more willingness to engage in CNM,whereas an anxious attachment style predicts negative attitudes (Moors et al., 2015, 2017).Individuals who are highly organized, neat, careful, and success-driven tend to have negativeattitudes toward CNM and less desire to engage in CNM (Moors et al., 2017). An extravertedpersonality predicts only negative attitudes toward CNM but not willingness for CNMengagement. Related, active imagination, openness to new experiences, and a preference forvariety predict positive attitudes toward CNM and a greater willingness to engage in CNMrelationships. Meanwhile, individuals with a more unrestricted socio-sexual orientation are more14likely to hold a positive attitude toward CNM and are more willing to accept and engage inCNM, whereas a restricted socio-sexual orientation predicts apprehension towards CNM (Cohenet al., 2017). While social and cultural factors can contribute to the development of restrictedsocio-sexual orientation, Moon (2021) discussed the connection between reproductive religiosityand sexual morality. In particular, certain reproductive-based religions imply a mating choicecharacterized by long-term, investment, and commitment, which facilitate trust in relationships.Therefore, religion can be used as a social cue to infer restricted socio-sexual orientation(Jackson et al., 2015; Moon et al., 2018; Moon et al., 2020). In fact, religious beliefs, morals, andvalues significantly predict non-engagement of CNM among African Americans, even thoughreligious membership does not significantly predict attitudes toward and willingness to engage inCNM (St. Vil & Giles 2022). Taken together, these findings may suggest that religion-basedmorality can influence a restricted socio-sexual orientation, which leads to the preference formonogamy. In sum, certain characteristics of an individual, such as personality, attachment style,and sociosexuality, can predict their attitudes toward CNM.The negative attitudes toward CNM, however, seem not to be static or unchangeable. Forexample, the level of negative attitudes that participants hold toward polyamory reduced whenprovided more descriptions of polyamory definitions and relationship characteristics to increaseunderstanding of as well as familiarity with polyamory (Hutzler et al., 2016). The changes inparticipants’ attitudes indicate that exposure to and relevant education on CNM may changepeople’s biases against and misperceptions of CNM, which is consistent with the contact theory(i.e., enhancing knowledge of outgroups to reduce privilege; Allport, 1954; Pettigrew & Tropp,2008). Meanwhile, people who are non-heterosexual, non-cisgender, have experienced CNM inthe past, and/or have knowledge of CNM hold a less negative attitude toward CNM (Conley et15al., 2013a, Conley et al., 2013b; Balzarini et al., 2018; Matsick et al., 2014. Moors et al., 2013).One possible explanation is the high prevalence of CNM within the LGBTQIA+ community maybe attributed to more exposure to CNM and a long history of practicing alternative relationships,leading LGBTQIA+ individuals to have more CNM knowledge and hold a more positive attitudetoward CNM. These findings suggest that education on and exposure to CNM, includingpolyamory, can contribute to addressing anti-CNM stigmas prevalent in Western society.CNM and Polyamorous Relationship QualityAlthough still in a nascent stage, research exists on the CNM relationship quality (such asBricker & Horne, 2007; Hoff et al., 2010; LaSala, 2004; Moors et al., 2021; Parsons et al., 2012;Séguin et al., 2017; Træen & Thuen, 2021). According to the research studies, CNMpractitioners report the same level of, or even higher, relationship satisfaction compared tomonogamous couples. In addition, few studies focused on exploring polyamorous relationshipquality (Balzarini et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2014; Flicker et al., 2021). Specifically, thesestudies examined the differences in relationship quality between hierarchical polyamory (e.g., aprimary dyad with secondary partners, who may be casual or committed) and non-hierarchicalpolyamory (e.g., all partners share similar levels of bonding, intimacy, and commitment).Individuals in non-hierarchical polyamory reported higher levels of relationship satisfaction thanthose in hierarchical polyamory (Balzarini et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2014; Flicker et al., 2021).Moreover, in primary-secondary hierarchical polyamorous relationships, individuals report agreater sense of closeness, emotional support and security, and higher levels of nurturance inprimary relationships compared to secondary relationships (Balzarini et al., 2019; Mitchell et al.,2014; Flicker et al., 2021). However, It is worth noting the limitations to the findings due to theinconsistencies in the definitions of primary and secondary partners across these three studies. In16addition, all three studies utilized quantitative methods to investigate the level of relationshipsatisfaction in different domains, which leaves room for further explorations of factorsinfluencing relationship satisfaction and nuances in relationship maintenance experiences.Many scholars have conceptualized factors that may influence individuals’ experiences inpolyamory (such as Ritchie & Barker, 2007; Robinson, 1997; Ziegler et al, 2014). Characteristicsof a polyamorous relationship may liberate women from the patriarchy that socializes them withvalues of caretaking, romance, family over personal pursuits, and financial independence(Ritchie & Barker, 2007; Robinson, 1997; Ziegler et al, 2014). Such arguments are consistentwith narratives from one study, where polyamorous women reported a feeling of liberation fromtraditional gender, maternal, and relationship roles (Sheff, 2005). A more balanced distribution offinancial and emotional resources in multi-partnered relationships may also benefit takinghousehold responsibilities and child-rearing (Emens, 2004; Sheef, 2010). Although polyamory isno exception to feelings of jealousy, it is also possible that open communication on such feelingsmay lead to greater awareness of oneself as well as others and a rise of compersion (a feeling ofjoy when seeing a loved one have a positive romantic and/or sexual experience with another;Deri, 2015; Veaus & Rickert, 2014). However, Jordan et al. (2017) also cautioned againstautomatic assumptions about such polyamorous benefits due to the varied social status ofindividual partners and relationship dynamics. For example, egalitarianism could collapse due togendered divisions of labor in a polyamorous relationship (Klesse, 2014). In addition, powerdifferentials can also lead to inequitable shared decision-making (e.g., decisions related to sex,allocation of veto power, addressing difficulties among partners, integration of new partners) cancontribute to discomfort and power struggle among partners (Wosick-Correa, 2010). Given the17diversity of polyamorous relationship structures and dynamics, partners can experience differentlevels of hierarchy, power, and intimacy.Factors Influencing CNM and Polyamorous Relationship QualityCurrently, only limited empirical studies have examined the internal and externalstressors that may influence polyamorous relationship quality. Witherspoon and Theodore (2021)also suggested that CNM-related minority stress can predict an increased level of psychologicaldistress, such as depressive and anxiety symptoms. In addition, Moors et al. (2020) suggestedthat the length of polyamorous relationships may predict relationship satisfaction and attachmentsecurity. Low levels of satisfaction with romantic and sexual relationship agreements with bothpartners and lower commitment to their primary partner are also evident among CNMpractitioners holding anti-CNM negativity. Additive stressors unique to polyamory, such ascommunication about relationship rules or contracts and the maintenance of attachment as wellas commitment across multiple relationships, can also contribute to negative mental health andrelationship well-being (Deri, 2015; Weitzman et al., 2009). Further, individuals in polyamorousrelationships face systemic challenges outside their relationship: namely a lack of legal andsocial recognition, social stigma (e.g., promiscuity, infidelity), and discriminatory laws andpolicies (Haritaworn et al., 2006; Klesse, 2005; Morrison et al., 2013; Sheff, 2011; Weitzman etal., 2009; Wright, 2014). Internalized stressors by individuals in CNM relationships can lead todeveloping negative attitudes towards CNM and personal discomfort (e.g., feelings of guilt andshame for non-monogamous feelings and desires), which predict lower levels of relationshipsatisfaction (Moors et al., 2021; Weitzman et al., 2009). Due to the experiences of additivestressors at different levels, polyamorists face more challenges in maintaining their personal andrelational well-being.18Relevance to CounselingMany individuals in CNM relationships reported negative experiences of biases andmicroaggressions when interacting with their healthcare providers (Vaughan et al., 2019).Healthcare providers demonstrated a lack of awareness and knowledge regardingnon-monogamous relationships and exhibited explicit and implicit judgment (e.g., language,facial expression) characterized as highly stressful (Vaughan et al., 2019). Sexual/affectionalexpansive individuals in polyamory may experience parallel stress in mental health services. In arecent study where 1, 220 participants currently engage in CNM, 20.3% reported at least oneexperience of explicit discrimination from a medical doctor, 19% reported discrimination frommental health providers, and 9% reported discrimination from other providers associated withtheir CNM status (Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). In their study on exploring CNM clients’perceptions of helpful and harmful mental health practices, Schechinger et al. (2018) suggestedthat counselors’ behaviors deemed to be harmful include being judgmental, pathological,dismissive, unknowledgeable, and overly focused on CNM. The stigmas, biases, anddiscriminations CNM practitioners face daily within their community as well as in the healthcaresystem based solely on relationship status contribute to frustration, stress, and concealment ofrelationship status that negatively influence their well-being and relationship quality (Moors etal., 2021; Vaughan et al., 2019). Contrarily, counselors who exhibit affirming behaviors, areknowledgeable about CNM, remain nonjudgemental, and provide helpful techniques onrelationship navigation and improvement were considered helpful (Schechinger et al., 2018).Similarly, participants in the Kisler and Lock (2019) study suggested family therapists seekeducation relevant to polyamory-related issues, challenge assumptions about relationships, andavoid pathologizing polyamorous relationships. While further research is needed to explore19CNM clients’ experiences in counseling, it is obvious that participants in previous studiescommonly reported healthcare providers, including counselors and therapists, demonstrated alack of competence in non-monogamous relationships to exhibit explicit and implicit judgment(e.g., language, facial expression) that is unhelpful and even harmful.The lack of empirical research and professional training may partially contribute to sucha lack of competence among healthcare providers, including counselors, to provide services toclients in polyamorous relationships. For example, CNM practitioners are significantlyunderrepresented in couples counseling research (Gebel et al., 2023). In addition, all currentWestern models of marriage and couples counseling used in counselor education programs areestablished under the premise that two adults join a monogamous relationship with/without thepurpose of creating a family, which leaves out the possibility of addressing alternativerelationship types, such as CNM. In theory, structural therapy may be adjusted to benefit CNMclients since it has been updated to treat alternative family configurations and focuses on thestructure, boundary, and dynamics among partners in CNM relationships (Gebel et al., 2023).Specifically, structural therapists may utilize joining and accommodating to build a strongtherapeutic alliance with CNM clients and understand the marginalization of CNM in amononormative society (Gebel et al., 2023). Other interventions (e.g., family mapping,enactment, unbalancing, mimesis) of structural therapy can be adapted to understand theboundaries and dynamics within as well as across different subsystems in a CNM relationshipand assist CNM clients in building healthy boundaries that are appropriate and fluid (Gebel et al.,2023). However, no empirical evidence exists to support the effectiveness of adapting andapplying Structural Therapy in the treatment of CNM clients. In addition, Fern (2020) developeda nested model based on her counseling practices to demonstrate how multi-dimensional trauma20and attachment injuries (i.e., self, relationship, home, local community, societal, collective) caninfluence individuals’ relationship experiences in polyamory. Fern (2020) pointed out theimportance of addressing attachment as the foundation for developing a sense of safety andsecurity in polyamorous relationships. To date, there are no known evidence-based counselinginterventions to support polyamorous clients in navigating their relationships.It is crucial for counselor researchers to investigate the establishment and maintenance ofpolyamorous relationships to support clients in considering, exploring, and navigatingpolyamory. Currently, the American Psychological Association has created a permanentCommittee of Consensual Non-Monogamy within Division 44 (the Society for the Psychology ofSexual Orientation and Gender Diversity) to focus on CNM-related research, psychologicalpractice, and education and outreach (Hamilton, 2021; Moors & Schechinger, 2014; Schechinger2017). Since non-heterosexual individuals are more likely to engage in non-monogamousrelationships (Balzarini et al., 2019; Haupert et al., 2017; Moor et al., 2014), the purpose of thecurrent study is to contribute to the advancement of sexuality and poly-affirmative care throughan empirical investigation of the barriers and resilience that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual(LGBP) individuals in polyamorous relationships experience. Acknowledging the need to updatecurrent marriage and couples counseling models or create a new model to meet the needs ofpolyamorous clients, the current study meets the urgency for counselors to enhance theircompetence in working with clients in polyamorous relationships through gaining moreknowledge of their relationship experiences.The Current StudyTo date, there is a paucity of research focusing on the relationship quality ofpolyamorists, and no known study is designed to specifically explore that of polyamorists who21have sexual/affectional expansive identities (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual). So far, onlythree empirical studies focused on examining the quality of polyamorous relationships (i.e.,Balzarini et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2014; Flicker et al., 2021). Specifically, it is consistent thatindividuals in a non-hierarchical relationship structure reported higher levels of relationshipsatisfaction (e.g., intimacy, commitment) than their counterparts in a hierarchical relationshipstructure (Balzarini et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2014; Flicker et al., 2021). In addition, amongindividuals who are in hierarchical polyamorous relationships, the level of relationshipsatisfaction is higher between primary partnerships in areas of intimacy, emotional support,security, and nurturance than between primary partners and tertiary partners (Balzarini et al.,2019; Mitchell et al., 2014; Flicker et al., 2021). More studies are warranted to explore factorscontributing to the differences in relationship satisfaction between non-hierarchical polyamoristrelationships and hierarchical ones and between primary partners and primary partners andtertiary partners. Moreover, the constructs of polyamorous relationship structures andpartnerships lack a universal definition in the current literature (Flicker et al., 2021). Forexample, Balzarini et al. (2019) asked participants to self-identify as their primary partners,while Mitchell et al. (2014) labeled primary partners as significant others and non-primarypartners as other significant others. It may be necessary to inquire from a qualitative approachthat allows participants themselves to define their relationship structures and provide insightsinto their experiences navigating multi-partnered relationships under such structures.According to research, individuals who have alternative sexual/affectional orientationsare more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to engage in polyamory and face parallelminority stress in mental health services as well as in society (Balzarini et al., 2019; Haupert etal., 2017; Moor et al., 2014; Vaughan et al., 2019; Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). It is also22suggested that CNMs in general have the same or a higher level of relationship quality thanmonogamy, although CNM practitioners, including individuals in polyamorous relationships,experience challenges in some aspects of their relationship. Therefore, the purpose of the currentstudy is to explore the lived experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals inpolyamorous relationships and the meaning ascribed to their relationship maintenanceexperiences. Specifically, the qualitative investigation will be completed by the followingresearch questions:RQ1: How do lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals establish theirpolyamorous relationships?RQ2: How do lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals in polyamorousrelationships perceive their sexual/relationship orientations influencing their relationshipexperiences?RQ3: How do lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals in polyamorous perceivetheir sense of identity influencing their relationship experiences?RQ4: How do lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals respond to personal,relational, and societal challenges in order to maintain their relationship?Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA; Smith et al., 2022) under the theoreticalframework of minority stress theory (Brooks, 1981; Meyer, 2003) will be utilized to answer theresearch questions. The minority stress theory pays close attention to the stress individuals faceand the resilience built for relationship maintenance (Meyer, 2003; Meyer, 2015). It isappropriate for the study as individuals who are sexual/affectional expansive and poly experiencesociopolitical stigma and may build personal as well as relational resilience. I will discuss theminority stress theory in detail in Chapter Two.23The current study recruited 14 participants, which is slightly beyond the recommendednumber of interviews for IPA (n<10, Smith et al., 2022). However, the rationale for includingover 10 participants is to provide different perspectives on polyamorous relationship experiencesbased on intersectional identities and experiences. In addition to following recommendedrecruitment strategy of IPA to use snowball sampling in order to achieve a certain level ofhomogeneity (Smith et al., 2022), LGBTQIA+ organizations (e.g. Society for Sexual,Affectional, Intersex, and Gender Expansive Identities) and polyamory organizations (e.g.,Polyamory Virginia) will be identified and contacted in an effort to include different perspectivesand voices from individuals with diverse backgrounds. Participants participating in the study willsit in a 60-75-minute individual Zoom interview. The rationale for interviewing individualsinstead of some or all partners in the polyamorous relationship is to ensure a safe andnon-judgmental environment to facilitate honest and genuine disclosure.The methods used based on the IPA (Smith et al., 2022) will be discussed in detail inChapter Three. Three theoretical components (i.e., phenomenology, hermeneutics, idiography;Smith et al., 2022) of IPA guided the data analysis process in Microsoft Word and Excel.Specifically, phenomenological and hermeneutic components focus on the lived experiences ofLGBP individuals in polyamorous relationships in maintaining their relationships and themeaning they have made out of the relationship maintenance experiences. The ideographiccomponent requires IPA researchers to attend to the particular, not only a particular phenomenonand a particular context but also a particular participant. Therefore, detailed and repetitive dataanalysis was carried out on each individual participant, including writing exploratory notes,constructing experiential statements, and identifying connections across experiential statementsfor personal experiential themes before comparing and contrasting across the group sample for24similarities and differences to develop group experiential themes across cases (Smith et al.,2022). As such, the inherent limitation of the current study lies in the limit to the generalizationof findings since it focuses on the experiences (i.e., relationship maintenance) of a small group ofa particular population (i.e., LGBP individuals) in a particular context (i.e., polyamorousrelationships, residing state, U.S.). However, the goal of the IPA is not to achieve a certaingeneralization of rules for human behaviors but rather to explore the details of individualexperiences that can add valuable insight into the generalization of theories (Smith et al., 2022).The choice of using IPA as the analytic framework for the current study aligns with thetheoretical emphasis of IPA on the exploration of subjective experiences of a phenomenon andthe meaning-making attached to them (Smith et al., 2022). In addition, my personal andprofessional philosophy that no absolute neutrality exists is in line with IPA’s acknowledgment ofthe influence of researchers’ beliefs, attitudes, and contexts on the data analysis andinterpretation (Smith et al., 2022). Therefore, as suggested by IPA, it is crucial that I discuss mypositionality in Chapter Three, including my experiences, beliefs, values, and potential beliefs,which I brought into the study process to ensure the rigor of the current study.As I have provided my rationale for the study in this chapter, I aim to provide existingliterature on the research topic, the methods for the study, an outline of results, and a discussionof the findings and their implications for counselors. Specifically, Chapter Two will include acomprehensive review of the literature on CNM and polyamory, including CNM prevalence,attitudes toward CNM, CNM and polyamorous relationship quality, CNM relationshipexperiences (e.g., polyamory), and minority stress process for being sexual/affectional expansiveas well as being polyamorous. I will provide an in-depth description of the theoretical frameworkand methodology of the study in Chapter Three. Themed categorized grounded in participants’25narratives will be included in Chapter Four, In Chapter Five, I will discuss the findings,including the interpretation of participants’ experiences and implications for counselors,followed by a brief conclusion.Key DefinitionsConsensual Non-Monogamy: Consensual Non-Monogamy (CNM) refers to intimate, sexual,and/or romantic relationships in which participants are aware of and consent to, the involvementwith more than one partner at a time for some aspect of the relationships (e.g., sexual, romantic,a combination of both; Conley et al., 2013a; Conley et al., 2013b; Grunt-Mejer & Campbell2016; Hamilton 2021; Muise et al., 2018).Polyamory: Polyamory assumes the possibility, validity, and worthwhileness of maintaining“intimate, sexual, and/or loving relationships with more than one person” (Haritaworn et al.,2006, p518).Relationship Satisfaction: Subjective evaluation of experiences, opinions, and feelings in one’srelationshipHeteronormativity: The assumption of normalcy, naturalness, and superiority of heterosexualityMononormativity: The assumption of normalcy and naturalness of monogamy (Pieper & Bauer,2005)Minority Stress: The stressors (internal and/or external) an individual with a minoritized identityare subject to in addition to normal everyday ones (Brooks, 1981; Meyer, 2003).Resilience: The quality of surviving and thriving in adversity (Meyer, 2015)26Chapter Two: Review of LiteratureIn Chapter Two, I provide a review of the theory and research related to consensualnon-monogamy polyamory. The chapter begins with a discussion of consensual non-monogamy,CNM prevalence in the U.S., and social attitudes toward CNM, followed by a detailed review ofpolyamory, including polyamorous relationships, polyamorous experiences, and legal, social, aswell as cultural barriers that individuals in polyamorous relationships face. Next, I present theprimary theoretical framework, the minority stress model (Brooks, 1981; Meyer, 2003), and itsrelevance to investigating issues related to sexual/affectional orientation and polyamory. Finally,I conclude the chapter with a summary of how current literature on CNM and polyamory providecontext and support for the current research study.Consensual Non-MonogamyConsensual Non-Monogamy (CNM) refers to intimate, sexual, and/or romanticrelationships in which participants are aware of and consent to, the involvement with more thanone partner at a time for some aspect of the relationships (e.g., sexual, romantic, a combinationof both; Conley et al., 2013a; Conley et al., 2013b; Grunt-Mejer & Campbell 2016; Hamilton2021; Muise et al., 2018). Generally, CNM relationships include but are not limited to openrelationships, swing, polyamory, and monogamish relationships. Each form of CNM is distinct interms of the typical relational dynamics and boundaries inferred. Open relationships typicallyrefer to those where partners consent to the sexual non-exclusiveness aspect of a relationship(Hamilton, et al., 2021; LaSala, 2004). Many CNM relationship configurations may also bedescribed as open. Polyamory refers to individuals having multiple short- or long-termextra-dyadic relationships that can be intimate, sexual, and/or romantic (Hamilton et al., 2021;Taormino, 2008). Swinging involves a couple having sexual but not intimate and/or romantic27relations with other couples and/or evolving “swapping” partners (Hamilton et al., 2021).Monogamish relationships feature a couple being monogamous primarily but engaging inextra-dyadic sexual activities together (e.g., threesome) or engaging in such activities with theother partner being present (Hamilton et al., 2021; Parson et al., 2012). Therefore, CNM broadlyencompasses several types of relationship dynamics that differ in terms of exclusivity with oneor more partners for intimate, romantic, or sexual involvement.To date, U.S. research on intimate relationships primarily focused on monogamousrelationships (e.g., Conley et al., 2012b; Hazan et al., 2006; Schmookler & Bursik, 2007).Monogamy refers to an exclusive long-term and committed relationship between two partners(Haupert et al., 2017). Trends in monogamy-focused research in the Western culture contribute tomonogamism or mononormativity and the devaluation and subordination of alternatives tomonogamy (e.g., CNM; Anderson, 2010). Monogamism is defined as a preferable attitudetoward monogamy and an assumption that all individuals desire and conform to monogamousrelationships (Blumer et al., 2014). The notion of monogamism is rooted in mononormativity,which deems monogamy as normalized and natural (Pieper & Bauer, 2005). However,monogamy-based research fails to concede the variety of relationship practices that exist. Forexample, scientists suggest that only a few known human cultures practice monogamy, not tomention that it is even less common in other animal species (Barash & Lipton, 2002; Rubin,2001; Ryan & Jetha, 2010). In addition, some revolutionary biologists argue a failure in researchto distinguish the difference between sexual monogamy (i.e., the establishment and maintenanceof sexual exclusivity between two partners) and social monogamy (i.e., the forming of an intensephysical and social bond between two partners; (Carter & Cushing, 2003; Gray & Garcia, 2013).Due to a lack of recognition and acknowledgment by researchers in many academic fields,28including counseling, it is possible that academia and the general public are interpreting theterms (i.e., social monogamy, sexual monogamy) in different ways. Furthermore, individuals inrelationships who claim themselves to be monogamous may not function as such, as Vangelistiand Gerstenberger (2004) documented approximately 60% of non-consensual non-monogamy(i.e., infidelity) in marriage. Nevertheless, monogamism or mononormativity still pervades andnon-monogamy is rarely investigated in the academic literature until recently.Research in the 1980s focused on the association between non-monogamy and gay men(Blasband & Peplau,1985; Blumstein & Schwartz, 1983; Hickson et al., 1992), with a decreasein research on this topic during the AIDS pandemic. Interestingly, trends in internet searchesshow an intensified attention to CNM for searches of the terms “open relationship” and“polyamory” rising in public between 2006 and 2015 (Moors, 2017). Some major media (e.g.,New York Times, Huffington Post) also published articles featuring positive accounts for CNM(e.g., polyamorous, open relationships, and swinging; Monroe, 2013; Oppenheimer, 2011; Reich,2014). Scientific American and Rolling Stone even claimed consensual non-monogamy to be thenext sexual revolution (Morris, 2014; Pappas, 2013). The rising interest in CNM among thegeneral public has led to a return of research interest. Now, researchers are slowly catching up toexamine the prevalence of CNM, individuals’ interest in and practice of CNM, and levels ofsocial, cultural, and legal acceptance of CNM (e.g., Barker & Langdridge, 2010; Haupert et al.,2017; Klesse 2005; Levine et al., 2018; Moors et al., 2013; Rubin et al., 2014). The findings ofthese studies provided valuable insights into the structures and dynamics of various types ofCNM relationships.Prevalence of CNM29The exact prevalence of non-monogamy is unknown due to a lack of census data and aconsistent definition of non-monogamy. Existing literature suggests that approximately 4%-5%of adults in the U.S. are in a CNM relationship, and about 20% of adults report previousexperience in CNM relationships in their lifetime (Fairbrother et al., 2019; Haupert et al., 2017;Levine et al., 2018; Rubin et al., 2014). Contrary to public assumptions that those who engage inCNM are more likely to self-identify as White people with a higher socioeconomic status (SES,e.g., middle class, upper class), Haupert et al. (2017) argued there was no association betweenengagement in CNM and such demographic variables (e.g., race, ethnicity, class, educationlevel). People of color are equally as likely to engage in CNM as White people, with thepercentage of people of color in each study ranging from zero to a high of 48%. One studyexamining the demographic comparison of American individuals in polyamorous andmonogamous relationships also suggests that multiethnicity is associated with a higher likelihoodof endorsing CNM (Balzarini et al., 2019). However, CNM phenomena are more commonamong individuals with lower education level, lower income, and/or unemployment (Balzarini etal., 2019). These findings were inconsistent with existing literature that socioeconomic statuswas not associated with engagement in CNM (Haupert et al., 2017; Rubin et al., 2014). Suchinconsistent findings from current research warrant further investigation into thesociodemographic factors associated with endorsement and engagement in CNM relationships.Some studies contend that religious affiliation, political affiliation, and geographic regions do notpredict the likelihood of engaging in CNM (Haupert et al., 2017, Rubin et al., 2014). However,Balzarini et al. (2019) suggested that individuals who were more likely to endorse CNM werecharacterized by gender as a woman or transgender person, non-heterosexual orientation (i.e.,lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual), no Christian affiliation, liberal or small political party30affiliations (e.g., Democratic, Green Party, Liberation), or experiences of divorce or separation. Itis also noteworthy that individuals identifying as non-binary or transgender are more likely topositively endorse or engage in polyamorous relationships (Balzarini et al., 2019). The mixedfindings for predictors of polyamory warrant further research investigations into the associationbetween CNM and an individual’s demographic variables.With regard to the association between sexual orientation and CNM, it is suggested thatnon-heterosexual individuals are more likely to hold a favorable attitude toward and engage inCNM, although the number of heterosexual people engaging in CNM is higher than that ofnon-heterosexual people (Haupert et al., 2017; Moors; 2014). In fact, one study suggests that78.6% of the people who had ever engaged in a CNM relationship identified as heterosexual(Haupert et al., 2017). The number of men reporting engaging in a CNM relationship is higherthan women, a pattern that is consistent across sexual orientations. There is a greater portion ofpeople who identify as non-heterosexual (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual) engage in aCNM relationship than do heterosexual people. Related, Moors (et al., 2014) documented nodifference between lesbians and gay men in their endorsement of CNM and willingness toengage in CNM relationships. Moreover, bisexual individuals are more likely than gay men andlesbians to engage in CNM (Balzarini et al., 2019; Haupert et al., 2017; Taormino, 2008).Meanwhile, heterosexual men and individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual are alsomore likely to be in a current CNM relationship (Haupert et al., 2017). Lesbians and gay menshare a variety of similarities in their love styles, specifically passionate love, gameplaying love,friendship love, practical love, obsessive love, and altruistic love (Moors et al., 2014). In fact,higher levels of openness to new experiences and conscientiousness predict attraction tomultiple-partner relationships among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals (Moors et al.,312017). These findings suggest that CNM is a practice that is not uncommon among individuals inthe lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual (LGBP) community instead of being exclusive to gaymen. No known study has examined contributors to LGBP individuals’ higher rate of engagingin a CNM relationship. However, scholars attempted to offer plausible explanations for such aphenomenon, which will be discussed further in the section on Non-Monogamy andNon-Heterosexuality.Attitude Toward CNMIn the past two decades, in addition to exploring the prevalence of CNM in Westernsociety and culture, researchers also have managed to investigate the public’s perception of andattitude toward CNM (e.g., Cohen & Wilson, 2017; Moors et al., 2013; Moors et al., 2015;Moors et al., 2017). Nevertheless, CNM is still not well accepted by society, probably due to itsviolation of the norms of monogamy and a perceived threat to monogamy (Moors. et al., 2013).Several studies yield findings that monogamy, Christianity, and political conservatism are robustpredictors of negative attitudes toward CNM (Conley et al., 2013a; Balzarini et al., 2018;Matsick et al., 2014. Moors et al., 2013). For example, individuals in a CNM relationship wereassumed to be promiscuous and sexually riskier (e.g., contracting sexually transmitted infections,STIs) than those in a monogamous relationship (Balzarini et al., 2018; Moors et al., 2013). CNMrelationships and the parties involved are also viewed as lower in relationship quality, lesssexually satisfied, and lonelier (Moore et al., 2013). In sum, anti-CNM stigma is prevalent inWestern culture where monogamy is the optimal relationship structure.Researchers also found a “halo” effect around monogamy as some positive ratings ofmonogamous relationships are based on arbitrary qualities (e.g., more likely to floss teeth daily)and less likely to use condoms, which suggests a higher level of sexual intimacy and trust32between partners (Moors et al., 2013). However, when considering that 60% of individuals inmonogamous marriages engaged in non-consensual extra-dyadic sexual activities, the risk ofcontracting STIs can be high among those individuals (Vangelisti & Gerstenberger, 2004). Infact, several studies suggested that CNM practitioners emphasize the importance of safe sex(e.g., condom use) for STI prevention (Conley et al., 2012a; Conley et al., 2013b; Lehmiller,2015). In addition, individuals in CNM relationships are more likely to discuss relationship rules,including safe sex (Hosking, 2013; Stewart et al., 2021), and men in CNM relationships are morelikely than their counterparts in nonconsensual non-monogamous relationships to engage in safesex (e.g., wearing a condom; Træen & Thuen, 2021). In sum, however, the public generally holdsnegative attitudes toward CNM, and some of them are rooted in mononormativity andmisperceptions of CNM.While CNM relationships are often perceived as negative, the levels of negativity seem todiffer based on the CNM subtypes (e.g., polyamorous relationships, swinging, openrelationships). For example, Matsick et al. (2014) explored the public's prescription, includingindividuals in monogamous and CNM relationships, on various types of CNM relationships.Participants rated polyamorous relationships as more favorable than both swinging and openrelationships and consider polyamorous relationships as more moral, more motivated by dutyrather than by pleasure, and less self-oriented than swingers and those in open relationships(Matsick et al., 2014). Individuals in open relationships are also perceived more negatively (e.g.,less moral) than those in polyamorous relationships. Swingers were perceived as the leastfavorable among the three subtypes of CNM relationships and viewed as kinkier, dirtier, lessresponsible, more adventurous, more radical, and more open to new experiences (Matsick et al.,2014). One possible explanation is that polyamorous relationships violate fewer norms of33monogamy since it involves social and emotional intimacy, which typically is absent in swingingand open relationships. Interestingly, the involvement of social and emotional intimacy alsocontributed to the negative attitudes toward polyamorous relationships held by swingers (Barker& Langdrige, 2010; Frank & DeLamater, 2010). Research documents narratives from swingersthat individuals in polyamory still uphold heteronormative and mononormative practices (Barker& Langdrige, 2010; Frank & DeLamater, 2010). Conversely, those in polyamorous relationshipsperceived swingers as dirtier, emotionally unavailable, and more sexually risky, which is similarto what the general public believes (Balzarini et al., 2018; Ritchie, 2010). The biases andmisperceptions exist not only within the CNM community but also in the larger society.Attitudes toward CNM also seem to differ based on one individual’s personality trait,attachment style, and socio-sexual orientation. For example, Moors et al. (2015; 2017) found thatindividuals with an avoidant attachment style are more likely to express a positive attitudetoward CNM and more willing to engage in CNM, while an anxious attachment style predicts anegative attitude. A possible explanation is that individuals who have an avoidant attachmentstyle may consider having multiple romantic and/or sexual partners to avoid a deep bond withone (Moors et al., 2015). In addition, active imagination, openness to engage in new experiences,and a preference for variety predict positive attitudes toward CNM and a greater willingness toengage in CNM relationships (Moors et al., 2017). Individuals who seem to be highly organized,neat, careful, and high in conscientiousness (which indicates success-driven) tend to perceiveCNM negatively and are less desired for CNM engagement. Negative attitudes toward CNM arealso evident among individuals who are extraverted (e.g., outgoing, assertive, and gregarious);however, extraversion is not associated with willingness to engage in CNM (Moors et al., 2017).Meanwhile, Cohen et al. (2017) examined perceptions of CNM based on one’s socio-sexual34orientation and found that both men and women with a more unrestricted socio-sexualorientation (also called sociosexuality which refers to a measure to assess the openness to engagein casual sex; Kinsey et al., 1948) held a more positive attitude toward CNM and are morewilling to accept and engage in CNM. In addition to social and cultural factors that contribute tothe development of restricted socio-sexual orientation, reproductive religiosity is associated withcertain sexual morality (Moon, 2021). In particular, certain reproductive-based religions imply amating choice characterized by long-term, investment, and commitment, which facilitate trust inrelationships. Therefore, religion can be used as a social cue to infer restricted socio-sexualorientation (Jackson et al., 2015; Moon et al., 2018; Moon et al., 2020). In fact, religious beliefs,morals, and values significantly predict non-engagement of CNM among African Americans,even though religious membership does not significantly predict attitudes toward and willingnessto engage in CNM (St. Vil & Giles 2022). Taken together, these findings may suggest thatreligion-based morality can influence a restricted socio-sexual orientation, which leads to thepreference for monogamy. However, these findings need to be interpreted with caution asattitude and willingness do not necessarily translate to behavior. Overall, a number of personalfactors influence how individuals consider CNM a viable relationship option or not.Individuals who actually practice CNM reported facing stigmas and/or biases in thehealthcare system (e.g., hospital, mental health service). For example, Vaughan et al. (2019)documented the negative experiences reported by CNM people when interacting with theirhealthcare providers. Participants shared that healthcare providers demonstrated a lack ofawareness and knowledge regarding non-monogamous relationships and exhibited explicit andimplicit judgment (e.g., language, facial expression) characterized as highly stressful.Witherspoon and Theodore (2021) also found among 1,220 participants currently engaged in35CNM, 20.3% reported at least one experience of explicit discrimination from a medical doctor,19% reported discrimination from mental health providers, and 9% reported discrimination fromother providers associated with their CNM status. The stigmas, biases, and discriminations CNMindividuals face daily within their community, in society, as well as in the healthcare systembased solely on relationship status, contribute to frustration, stress, and concealment ofrelationship status that negatively influence their well-being and relationship quality (Moors etal., 2021; Vaughan et al., 2019). For example, internalized personal discomfort (e.g., perceivingCNM as unnatural) is linked to lower satisfaction with romantic and sexual relationshipagreement, overall relationship satisfaction, and relationship commitment. Such a findingindicates the negative impact of monogamism on one’s self and their CNM relationship quality.The negative attitudes toward CNM, however, seem not to be static or unchangeable. Astudy compared the levels of negative attitudes of participants by only providing a briefdefinition of polyamory and a detailed description of CNM (e.g., definition, experience; Hutzleret al., 2016). The level of negative attitudes of participants reduced when provided moredescriptions of CNM definitions and relationship characteristics to increase understanding of andfamiliarity with CNM. The findings indicate that exposure to and relevant education on CNMmay change people’s biases against and misperceptions of CNM, which is consistent with thecontact theory (Allport, 1954; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). Meanwhile, people who arenon-heterosexual, non-cisgender, have experienced CNM in the past, and/or have knowledge ofCNM hold a less negative attitude toward CNM (Conley et al., 2013a, Balzarini et al., 2018;Matsick et al., 2014. Moors et al., 2013). Contact theory may also explain the higher levels ofpositive attitudes toward CNM among non-heterosexual persons (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual,pansexual) and non-cisgender persons (e.g., transgender, non-binary, agender, other). It is36assumed that the higher prevalence of CNM within the LGBTQIA+ community contributes tomore frequent exposure to CNM, which may have led non-heterosexual and non-cisgenderindividuals to acquire relevant CNM knowledge and hold more positive attitudes toward CNM.Although CNM and sexual orientation are two distinct constructs, individuals who are in a CNMrelationship or who are non-heterosexual often share parallel lived experiences of facing stigmaand discrimination in society.Consensual Non-Monogamy and Sexual OrientationPersons in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual (LGBP) community are more likelyto endorse and engage in a CNM relationship than heterosexual individuals, although the numberof heterosexual people engaging in CNM is higher (Haupert et al., 2017; Moors; 2014). Thishigher prevalence of CNM among non-heterosexual individuals may be related to the fact thatqueer people are less constrained by heteronormative expectations, such as monogamy, in spiteof facing historical experiences of oppression and pathologization (Hamilton et al., 2021).Therefore, LGBP individuals may embrace more opportunities to explore and define theirsexuality and relationship outside the socially and culturally prescribed hetero- andmononormativity.More research expanded their target populations across sexual orientations, includingheterosexuality (Levine et al., 2018; Moors et al., 2015, Moors et al., 2017, Séguin et al., 2016;Træen & Thuen, 2021). Yet, it is important that we remember the history of CNM and itsconnections to marginalized sexualities (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual; Hamilton et al., 2021). Mostearly CNM studies (i.e., open relationships) in a Western society focused on gay men’s livedexperiences due to the high prevalence of CNM in this population (Blasband & Peplau,1985;Blumstein & Schwartz, 1983; Hickson et al., 1992). Recent literature also suggests an equal37prevalence of CNM among lesbians and an increased likelihood of CNM engagement amongbisexual and pansexual individuals when compared with lesbian women and gay men (Haupertet al., 2017). As aforementioned, non-heterosexual individuals and people in a CNM relationshipshare parallel marginalization and oppression in society due to violation of social and culturalnorms (e.g., heteronormativity, mononormativity). Religious and political conservatism (e.g.,Christianity, republic party) contribute to the challenges of social, cultural, and legal acceptanceof both non-heterosexuality and CNM (Balzarini et al., 2018; Hutzler et al., 2016). In fact, manyconservative politicians and pundits connected CNM (i.e., polyamory) to their position to opposethe legalization of same-sex marriage (Kurtz, 2003; Lithwick, 2004). For example, Kurtz (2003)argued that the legitimacy of same-sex marriage would also lead to legitimizing all forms ofpassion deemed immoral or illegal while leaving society defenseless against an onslaught ofunbounded desire. Furthermore, Kurtz (2003) argued that polyamory would be a pivotal stepdown the slippery slope from same-sex marriage to social debauchery and chaos. ManyLGBTQIA+ activists in the past distanced themselves from polyamory advocacy (Klesse, 2018),perhaps fearing advocating for social and legal acceptance of CNM in their agenda mayjeopardize the community’s effort to fight for marriage equality (i.e., the legalization of same-sexmarriage).While non-heterosexual individuals and individuals in CNM relationships share paralleland even some overlapping social biases and prejudices, it is also crucial to identify the uniquechallenges they face. In a study investigating the stigma against CNM relationships, participantsrated gay and lesbian couples in monogamous relationships as sexually riskier and less sociallyacceptable to society than heterosexual couples (Moors et al., 2015). On the other hand, CNMrelationships were perceived as a threat to monogamy; CNM practitioners were viewed more38negatively than those engaging in monogamy regardless of their sexual orientation (Moors et al.,2013). Loneliness, high level of sexual risk, low relationship quality, low level of sexualsatisfaction, less likelihood of condom use, and low social acceptability were often associatedwith couples in CNM relationships (Moors et al., 2013). In sum, individuals whopractice/identify as CNM experience negative attitudes, biases, and even discrimination based ontheir sexual identity and/or practice.In theory, non-heterosexual individuals who engage in CNM may face double oppressiondue to their sexual orientation and relationship structure. Therefore, it is crucial for researchers toinvestigate factors influencing the establishment of CNM relationships and the maintenance ofrelationship quality among this population. Within the field of psychology, the Division 44 of theAmerican Psychological Association (APA) is the Society for the Psychology of SexualOrientation and Gender Diversity, within which a permanent Committee of ConsensualNon-Monogamy focuses on research, psychological practice, and education and outreach(Hamilton, 2021; Moors & Schechinger, 2014; Schechinger 2017). Such scientific exploration ofCNM, sexual orientation, and gender identity may reduce the negative biases against individualswith gender identities, LGBP sexual/affectional orientations, and consensual non-monogamy.PolyamoryThe word polyamory was a combination of the Greek word “many” and the Latin word“amores”, which can be translated as many loves (Klesse, 2011). The term polyamory wasclaimed to be invented by the founders of a neo-pagan church in the U.S. in the early 1990s,while its variations in terminology have existed since the 1950s (Alan, 2010; Anapol, 2010). Thechallenge in a universal definition of polyamory persists given that its meaning varies amongindividuals in polyamorous relationships ( Barker, 2005; Bettinger, 2005; Keener, 2004; Klesse,392006; Klesse, 2011; Sheff, 2011). In general, polyamory assumes the possibility, validity, andworthwhileness of maintaining “intimate, sexual, and/or loving relationships with more than oneperson” (Haritaworn et al., 2006, p518). Since the 1990s, research on polyamory has grown inthe fields of social sciences (e.g., Barker & Langdridge 2010). For example, Lano and Parry(1995) suggested polyamory as an umbrella term for multiple approaches to responsiblenon-monogamy. The endorsement of consensus and a series of values (e.g., honesty,self-knowledge, self-possession, integrity, value of sex and love over jealousy) imply varioustheories on polyamory, which contend a philosophical discourse (Emens, 2004; Klesse, 2014).Polyamory is also defined as a relationship orientation, describing a love style of entering and/ormaintaining multiple intimate and/or sexual relationships simultaneously (Anapol, 2010).In recent years, scholars also attempt to categorize polyamory as an identity, which isevident in participants’ narratives from previous research (e.g., Barker, 2005, Klesse, 2007). Inone study, Barker (2005) focused on the construction of a polyamorous identity, narratives aboutpolyamorous as a natural state of being are not uncommon among participants, although somedescribe polyamory as a choice of practice – a behavior that people can choose and/or work at.The identity reference to polyamory is tied closely to the LGBT coming-out process researchliterature and political writing (Weitzman, 2006; Rambukkana, 2004). For example, the words“natural” and “hard-wired” expressed by participants in Barker’s study (2005) resonate with thesexual orientation accounts for the insistence on stability and durability (Klesse, 2014). Amongresearchers who claimed polyamory as a sexual orientation, Tweedy (2011) argued such aclassification of polyamory could benefit polyamorous individuals with regard to state-basedworkplace anti-discrimination legislation. In her argument, Tweedy (2011) stated that polyamorypeople experienced discrimination in marriage law (e.g., couples only), criminal law (e.g.,40anti-bigamy and adultery laws), and family law (e.g., discriminatory custody decisions). Shesuggested that the sexual orientation category defined in the current anti-discrimination lawscould be accommodated for polyamory. However, Klesse (2014) criticized such categorization ofpolyamory as one sexual orientation, arguing that equating polyamory with sexual orientationmay only achieve selective legal protection for polyamory while failing to seek poly alliance andallyship to foster “a politics of recognition” (p.92). Klesse pointed out a limited readiness for thepolyamory movement to build an advocacy coalition with other consensually non-monogamousrelationships, as polyamorous people often held negative biases and even distanced them fromother sex-orientated styles of non-monogamy (e.g., swing, casual sex; Klesse, 2007). To date, theattempt to define polyamorous varies from a philosophical lens to the perspectives ofrelationship orientation and sexual orientation. Yet. the discourse on the definition of polyamorycontinues, accompanied by scholarly efforts to understand polyamory based on its differentrelationship structures.Polyamorous Relationship StructuresThere is no one way to polyamory given the diversity of polyamorous relationshipstructures. An attempt to categorize polyamorous relationship structures may fall into ignoranceof such diversity, which limits polyamory within a monogamous culture (Emens, 2004; Heckert,2010). Nevertheless, existing literature described some prominent polyamorous relationships(such as Bettinger, 2005; Strassberg, 2003). Hierarchy exists in some polyamorous relationships,which refers to the existence of a primary dyad with secondary partners, who may be casual orcommitted (Fin et al., 2012; Wosik-Correa, 2010). Some polyamorous relationships can be morecomplicated depending on the level of commitment, involvement, and agreement amongmembers (Klesse, 2014). For example, triad or quad relationships can involve three or four41partners sharing relationships with each other, characterized by deep bonding, intimacy, andcommitment (Aoki, 2005; Bettinger, 2005). However, it is also not uncommon that one personmay have two relationships with equal priority where two partners share no relationship with oneanother (Witherspoon & Wilson, 2013). In addition, a polyamorous relationship can be closed,meaning partners remain committed and intimate exclusively with one another, or open, whichallows new members emotionally or sexually to enter the relationship system (Taormino, 2008;Witherspoon & Wilson, 2013). Due to the diversity of polyamorous relationship structures, arigid conceptualization of polyamory should be cautioned (Barker, 2005; Jordan et al., 2017).Many feminists argued that polyamory could lead women to liberation from relationshipscharacterized by patriarchal and gendered influences (e.g., Ritchie & Barker, 2007; Robinson,1997). Such arguments are consistent with narratives from one study, where polyamorouswomen reported a feeling of liberation from traditional gender, maternal, and relationship roles(Sheff, 2005). So, some individuals who engage in polyamory report positive experiences ofliberation; however, power differentials often still exist among partners, which can complicatethe creation and maintenance of polyamorous relationships (Goldner, 1985; Klesse, 2004;Klesse, 2006; Rampage, 2002). In addition, Sheff (2013) suggested that a power differential canexist in the structure of a polyamorous relationship. In a primary-secondary polyamorousrelationship, for example, the primary partners may mainly prescribe rules for their extradyadicrelationships, which can create a hierarchy between partners (Bettinger, 2005; Veaux & Rickert,2014). Even in a polyamorous relationship (e.g., polyfidelity) where partners are committed toeach other, power differentials can still emerge during the decision-making process of partners(e.g., majority rule, consensus; Aoki, 2005; Gilmore & de Arcana, 2015; Strassberg, 2003).42Wosick-Correa (2010) also documented some other commonly known decisions inpolyamorous relationships, including decisions related to sex, allocation of veto power,addressing difficulties among partners, and integration of new partners. Inequitable shareddecision-making can contribute to power imbalance which leads to discomfort and powerstruggle among partners. Some polyamorous relationships establish ground rules, boundaries,and relationship contracts and are open for negotiation as well as communication (Anapol, 2010;Deri, 2015; Easton & Hardy, 2011; Gilmore & de Arcana, 2015; Heaney, 2011; Taormino, 2008;Veaus & Ricket, 2014). So far, existing research offered insights into the hierarchy (e.g.,hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical polyamory) and power dynamics (e.g., equal sharing ofdecision-making vs. unbalanced decision-making) among partners in various polyamorousrelationship structures. In the next section, I discuss existing literature related to individuals’lived experiences within the relationship structure and in the larger context of society.Polyamorous ExperiencesIndividual experiences in a polyamorous relationship can vary due to the relationshipstructure and external influences (e.g., legal recognition, social and cultural acceptance). Withina polyamorous relationship system, some research characterized polyamorous relationships asegalitarianism, deep commitment, loving, and open communication among partners (Aguilar,2013; Séguin, 2019). Contrary to a common belief that multi-partnered relationships benefit menover women, it is argued that polyamorous women report feeling liberated from traditionalgender, maternal, and relationship roles (Sheff, 2005). It is possible that the characteristics of apolyamorous relationship can create opportunities for polyamorous women to free themselvesfrom the patriarchy that socializes women with values of caretaking, romance, and family overpersonal pursuits and financial independence (Ziegler et al, 2014). In addition, the distribution of43financial and emotional resources among partners in a polyamorous relationship can also benefittaking household responsibilities and child-rearing (Emens, 2004; Sheff, 2010). However, Jordanet al. (2017) cautioned against automatic assumptions about such polyamorous benefits due tothe varied social status of individual partners and relationship dynamics. For example,egalitarianism could collapse due to gendered divisions of labor in a polyamorous relationship(Klesse, 2014).Open communication and negotiation start at the beginning of a polyamorous relationshipand continue to happen during the maintenance of the relationship. Common issues and concernsthat partners negotiate in a polyamorous relationship include relationship parameters,agreements, boundaries, coming out as polyamorous (e.g., to family members, friends,workplace, children), identifying social support and resources, and challenges due to separation(Weitzman et al., 2009). The ground rules, boundaries, and relationship contracts established canbenefit the resolution of those issues and concerns (Easton & Hardy, 2011; Taormina, 2008).However, as aforementioned, a polyamorous relationship can include a hierarchy betweenmembers (e.g., primary-secondary partner formation) and can also be closed or open. Such arelationship structure implicates who can attend to the negotiations on those issues and who hasthe power to make decisions, which may contribute to an inequitable share of thedecision-making process. For example, power imbalance can arise when partners discussopening their previously monogamous relationship, as one partner may experience pressure toconform to their partner’s desire to introduce new partners to their relationship (Klesse, 2014).Power dynamics can also be changed or shifted when new partners enter an already-establishedrelationship system (Wosick-Correa, 2010). Existing literature suggests that polyamorousrelationships are no exception to jealousy (Deri, 2015; Heaney, 2011), although polyamory is44established on the premise of consensual non-monogamy. Some partners, especially the oneswho perceive themselves with less power, may experience jealousy characterized by a sense ofbetrayal and a need to control the relationship (Deri, 2015; Keener, 2004; Mint, 2010; Pines,2013). However, it is also possible in a polyamorous relationship that feelings of jealousy can beattended to with open communication, which can create opportunities for greater awareness ofoneself and others and a rise of compersion (a feeling of joy when seeing a loved one engage in apositive romantic and/or sexual experience with another; Deri, 2015; Veaus & Rickert, 2014).The lived experiences in a polyamorous relationship can further be complicated due tostructural power influenced by intersecting political, social, and cultural identities (Haritaworn etal., 2006; Klesse, 2006). Race, gender, class, dis(ability), and sexual orientation can influence apartner’s experiences in society (e.g., workplace discrimination, fewer earnings), which in return,creates a power imbalance that can lead to a sense of insecurity and dependence (Haritaworn etal., 2006; Klesse. 2006; Wilson, 2002). External forces (e.g., legal acceptance, discrimination,social support) can also influence polyamorous experiences.Experiences Outside PolyamoryIndividuals in polyamorous relationships may experience negativity in society (e.g.,school, workplace, community) due to their relationship orientation (i.e., polyamory), which inturn influences their experiences within their relationships. Monogamous privileges have beentaken for granted through the process of social, cultural, and legal recognition in many countries,although it faces criticism for promoting a heteronormative and patriarchal culture that benefitsmen over women (Robinson, 1997; Rosa, 1994; Ziegler et al, 2014). For example, monogamy isinstitutionalized in the U.S. as the optimal relationship through policy, religion, and social norms(Coontz, 2004; D’emilio & Freedman, 1997; Smith, 1993). Polyamory is not legally45acknowledged and protected in the U.S. (Aviram & Leachman, 2014; Davis 2010; Tweedy,2011). Such a lack of legal recognition can contribute to challenges for partners in polyamorousrelationships (e.g., unable to obtain government tax deductions or medical insurance, challengesin seeking child support and alimony after separation, discriminatory custody cases; Aviram &Leachman, 2014; Barnett 2014; Black, 2006, Davis, 2010; Dryden, 2015, Sheff, 2013;Strassberg, 2003). In fact, custody issues have been recorded as the frequently mentionedconcerns and fear expressed by divorcing patterns in polyamorous relationships (Barnett, 2014;Black, 2006).A monogamist and mononormative culture also contribute to discrimination andstigmatization experienced by individuals in polyamorous relationships. CNM practitioners facebeing stigmatized as immoral, corrupt, promiscuous, and deviant (Moors et al., 2013). It is notuncommon for a person in a polyamorous relationship to live double lives, avoiding disclosingtheir relationships in public, in an effort to protect themes from potential stigmatization anddiscrimination (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2010). For example, a feeling of exclusion is often reported bythose who disclose their polyamorous relationship status to friends, family, and colleagues(Sheff, 2011). Partners can also feel rejected if family members and friends refuse to accept thepartnerships. A physical and emotional cutoff can also occur between polyamorous practitionersand their rejecting families and friendships, which then can lead to feelings of isolation (Sheff,2013). Both parents and children from polyamorous families also experienced stigmatization inschool from students, teachers, and other parents (Otter, 2014; Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2006). The lackof recognition of CNM relationships in the workplace can also potentially contribute to feelingsof exclusion and potential discrimination (Klesse, 2014). Experiences of stigmatization and46discrimination in a monogamist society can create a deleterious impact on polyamorousrelationships and cause tensions in partnerships (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2006; Sheff, 2011).The over-sexualization of racially minoritized groups, LGBTQ, and working-class peopleand the asexualization of persons with disabilities can be exacerbated when individuals engage inpolyamorous relationships that are considered promiscuous and immoral (Haritaworn et al.,2006; Hutchinson, 1999; Klesse, 2012, Klesse, 2014; Sheff & Hammers, 2011). Some argue suchdiscrimination can contribute to a sense of invisibility of intersecting identities in polyamory,which can be detrimental to the relationship quality (Klesse, 2018; Rambukkanna, 2015).Therefore, different aspects of one’s identity also contribute to the varied experiences inpolyamorous relationships and therefore influence the levels of relationship quality.Relationship QualityRelationship satisfaction is a common indicator of relationship quality that researchersused across different types of CNM relationships (Bricker & Horne, 2007; Hoff et al., 2010;LaSala, 2004; Flicker et al., 2021; Moors et al., 2021; Parsons et al., 2012; Séguine et al., 2017;Stults, 2019; Whitton et al., 2015). Some researchers suggest no difference between gay andbisexual men in monogamous and non-monogamous relationships with regard to relationshipsatisfaction, communication quality, and sexual satisfaction (Bricker & Horne, 2007; Hoff et al.,2010; LaSala, 2004; Parsons et al., 2012; Séguine et al., 2017; Stults, 2019; Whitton et al., 2015).In addition, individuals with a consensual extradyadic experience report high levels of bothrelationship intimacy, and positive attitudes toward sex and sexuality, regardless of their sexualorientation and gender (Træen & Thuen, 2021). Contradicting the popular Western belief thatmonogamy is the optimal relationship for intimacy, relationship satisfaction, and sexualsatisfaction, less sexual jealousy was documented among men in monogamish and open47relationships and greater levels of intimacy among heterosexual polyamorous men and women,compared to their monogamous counterparts (Parsons et al., 2012). Yet, inconsistencies alsoexist, in spite of these positive findings for CNM relationship quality.With a closer examination of CNM relationship quality, it is suggested that individualsmay report less favorably on certain aspects of their relationships. For example, in a studyconducted in 1983, CNM lesbian couples reported less sexual satisfaction and less commitmentto the main relationship, whereas no relationship between those variables was identified amonggay men (Blumstein & Schwartz, 1983). However, the study may be outdated as genderdifferences in sexual satisfaction and commitment may have changed in the past four decades.Hosking (2013) also suggested lower levels of passion among Australian gay men in openrelationships compared to those in monogamous and threesome-only relationships. This findingindicates that CNM types may predict relationship quality.So far, only fewer studies focused on exploring polyamorous relationship quality(Balzarini et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2014; Flicker et al., 2021). In primary-secondaryhierarchical polyamorous relationships, individuals may have a greater sense of closeness,emotional support and security, and higher levels of nurturance in primary relationshipscompared to secondary relationships (Balzarini et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2014). However, thedefinition of primary partner was inconsistent across the two studies. Specifically, Balzarini et al.(2019) asked participants to self-identify as their primary partners, while Mitchell et al. (2014)labeled primary partners as significant others and non-primary partners as other significantothers. Such inconsistencies can complicate the interpretation of findings as the ill-establisheddefinition of ‘primary partners’ may not match the participant's perception of their partners.Moors et al. (2020) provided more insight into the differences in relationship quality between48hierarchical and non-hierarchical polyamorous relationships. Specifically, no statisticallysignificant differences were documented in variability in relationship satisfaction betweenhierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships. However, individuals in hierarchicalrelationships reported lower levels of overall relationship satisfaction compared to those innon-hierarchical relationships. Furthermore, individuals reported lower relationship satisfactionwith secondary partners, although no such significant differences were suggested betweennon-hierarchical and primary partners (Flicker et al., 2021). In sum, the three studies all shedlight on the influence of hierarchy on polyamorous relationships, namely partners innon-hierarchical polyamorous relationships reporting a higher level of relationship satisfactionthan those in hierarchical polyamorous relationships. However, research attention topolyamorous relationship quality is limited, and none of the existing studies examined thespecifics within different polyamorous relationship structures that contributed to the differencesin relationship quality. Therefore, more research is warranted to examine the factors that impactindividual experiences in polyamory that influence relationship quality.Limited studies also explore factors that may influence polyamorous relationship quality.For example, the length of a polyamorous relationship may predict relationship satisfaction andattachment security (Flicker et al., 2021). Specifically, for individuals in polyamorousrelationships of five years or less, greater attachment avoidance and lower relationshipsatisfaction were detected among hierarchical relationships than those in non-hierarchicalrelationships. Such a finding seems inconsistent with current research on relationship quality ofmonogamous relationships, within which relationship satisfaction decreases over time whilestability increases (Karney & Bradbury, 1995). Therefore, a longitudinal study investigatingpolyamorous relationship satisfaction and stability is warranted. In addition, Moors et al. (2021)49seemed to provide some insight into the influence of internalized CNM negativity on relationshipquality. Specifically, people in CNM (i.e., polyamory, swinging, open relationships) who expressnegative attitudes toward CNM and personal discomfort with CNM report lower levels ofrelationship satisfaction. Low levels of satisfaction with romantic and sexual relationshipagreements with both of their partners and lower commitment to their primary partner are alsoevident among CNM practitioners holding anti-CNM negativity (Moors et al., 2021). Suchfindings shed light on the negative influence of internalized CNM negativity on relationshipquality, although how individuals internalize CNM negativity and how such internalizationinfluences relationship quality needs further research. It also suggested that individualexperiences outside their relationship may influence their engagement with partners and affecttheir relationship quality.Minority Stress ModelMinority stress theory was first developed to conceptualize a multilevel model of culturaland social stressors (e.g., interpersonal stressors, economic factors) faced by lesbian women(Brooks, 1981). These external stressors can be transmitted into biophysical and psychologicalstressors that influence the cognitive structure of the individuals and consequent readjustment oradaptational failure. Meyer (2003) adapted the minority stress theory and created a minoritystress model for understanding mental health discrepancies among minoritized populations dueto one’s identities (e.g., sexual orientation, gender, race). The model posits that individuals with aminoritized identity are subject to internal and external stressors in addition to normal everydaystressors. Specifically, a minority status can lead one to be more susceptible to prejudiced events(e.g. discrimination, violence), which Meyer (2003) defined as “distal minority stressors” (p.5).Such stressors are more objective and are not based on one’s perceptions or appraisals. For50example, besides general stressors, an Asian gay man may experience racism and homophobiadue to his racial identity and sexual orientation in a racist and heteronormative society.In addition, an individual with a minoritized identity may also experience a “proximalstressors” process (p.5), such as expecting rejection and discrimination, concealing identity in anattempt to avoid discrimination, and internalizing oppressive ideologies. For instance, the sameAsian gay man may be hypervigilant when interacting with others, conceal their sexualorientation to avoid homophobia, and internalize the idea that ‘gay men will go to hell.’ Duringthe minority stress process, the additive effects of minority stressors can create discrepancies inmental health outcomes that lead to disproportionate levels of mental health symptoms (e.g.,depression, anxiety) among minoritized individuals (Meyer, 1995; Meyer, 2003).In the process of minority stress, other factors, including salience, valence, andintegration with one’s other identities can modify the effects of minority stressors on one’s life.(Meyer, 2003). The level of identification, commitment, and development of identity cancontribute to the extent to which the emotional impact of stressors on one’s life (Meyer, 2003;Thoits, 2013). It should be noted that identity is fluid rather than static, with the prominence ofidentity shifting with social contexts (Brooks, 1981; Crocker & Quinn; 2000). Meyer (2003)referred to valence as the evaluative features of identity and is connected to self-validation.While positive valence may contribute to higher levels of self-acceptance and lower levels ofinternalized stigma, negative valence may predict mental health problems (e.g., depression;Allen et al., 1996; Woolfolk et al., 1995). Furthermore, integrating one’s minoritized identitywith other identities can also predict the level of self-acceptance, which may ameliorate minoritystressors.51Such factors can be a source of strength and resilience for individuals with a minoritizedstatus, especially when one develops high levels of self-acceptance, commitment to communityengagement to build social support, and coping skills (Branscombe et al., 1999; Meyer. 2003;Meyer, 2015; Miller & Major, 2000). Meyer (2015) cautioned that resilience building shoulddepend on both individuals and communities, although individual resilience can be beneficial toameliorate the impact of minority stress. In sum, a person’s minority status can be both a sourceof stress and a crucial modifier of stress effect during the stress process (Meyer, 2003). Theminority stress model provides considerable theoretical value when examining the externalstressors that influence mental health outcomes among marginalized groups (Borgogna et al.,2019; Brooks, 1981; Meyer 2003).Process of Minority Stress for NonheterosexualityThe minority stress model provides a theoretical framework useful for investigating theassociation between minoritized identities (e.g., LGBTQIA+) and the high prevalence of mentalhealth symptoms (Meyer, 2015; Meyer & Frost, 2013; Testa et al., 2015). Anti-gaydiscrimination experienced by LGB individuals predicted a higher likelihood of mental healthsymptoms (Herek, et al., 1999). Social and cultural stigma against non-heterosexual individualscan lead to experiences of alienation, lack of integration with the community, and challengeswith self-acceptance (Grossman & Kener, 1998; Meyer, 2003; Stokes & Peterson, 1998). Suchstress processes are linked to mental health symptoms, such as depressive symptoms, substanceuse, and suicide ideations (Meyer, 1995; Waldo, 1999). In a meta-analysis of 179 effect sizesfrom 32 research reports on the association between minority stress and relationship well-being,Cao et al., (2017) found that minority stress was significantly and negatively associated withrelationship well-being, although the effect size was small - the more stress from experiences of52being minoritized, the lower a person’s report of relationship quality. In addition, internalizedhomophobia moderately predicted low levels of relationship well-being. However, sexualorientation visibility and heterosexist discrimination did not predict relationship quality in thesame way. Such findings suggest that the proximal factors in the minority stress process have astronger influence on same-sex relationship well-being (Meyer, 2003).Historically, nonheterosexual individuals were subject to human rights abuses andmistreatment, including denial of human dignity, anti-gay violence, and even murder, many ofwhich were sanctioned by governments through discriminatory laws and religious organizationsthrough religious traditions (Meyer, 2003). In the U.S., for example, sexual orientation was not aprotected class in the original Title VII of Civil Rights until President Obama signed anexecutive order in 2014 adding sexual orientation and gender identity protections for all federalemployees (McAnallen, 2015). The decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Bostock v.Clayton County protected nonheterosexual and transgender individuals against employmentdiscrimination (e.g., hiring, promotion, training), as cited that prohibition against sexdiscrimination in Title VII included employment discrimination against one’s sexual orientationor transgender status (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 2021). However, TitleVII may not apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees, Tribal nations, independentcontractors, religious organizations, and religious educational institutions (U.S. EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission, 2021). The legalization of same-sex marriage in the U.S.in 2015 provided non-heterosexual individuals with equal marriage rights and contributed to asteeper decline of both implicit and explicitly anti-gay biases across the country (Ofosu et al.,2019). While the findings suggest that legislation can shape public attitudes, the authors alsocautioned that attitudes and legislation could be mutually reinforcing, meaning that attitudes53towards gay men and lesbians can be momentum for state and federal legalization (Ofosu et al.,2019). Given the rise of anti-LGBTQIA+ legislation passing in some states in the U.S. (e.g.,Florida, Texas, Virginia), continuous effort to advocate for LGBTQIA+ equality is stillwarranted.Process of Minority Stress for PolyamorySimilar to the minority stress process experienced by non-heterosexual individuals due totheir minoritized sexual orientation, CNM individuals can also face bias, stigma, anddiscrimination based on their identity and behavior. Researchers argued the theoretical value ofthe minority stress model in conceptualizing the lived experiences of CNM practitioners, as theyhold a marginalized status within mainstream Western society (Hutzler et al., 2016; Johnson etal., 2015; Moors et al., 2013; Ritchie & Barker, 2007; Weitzman et al., 2009). Asaforementioned, CNM individuals may face a lack of legal and social recognition, social stigma(e.g., promiscuity, infidelity), and discriminatory laws and policies (Haritaworn et al., 2006;Klesse, 2005; Morrison et al., 2013; Sheff, 2011; Weitzman et al., 2009; Wright, 2014). Suchexternal stressors can be internalized by CNM individuals, which leads to feelings of guilt andshame for non-monogamous feelings and desires (Weitzman et al., 2009). In addition, additivestressors unique to CNM, such as communication about relationship rules or contracts and themaintenance of attachment as well as commitment across multiple relationships, can alsocontribute to negative mental health and relationship well-being for CNM individuals (Deri,2015; Weitzman et al., 2009).The minority stress theory provides valuable conceptual insights into the minority stressprocess of polyamory. However, only limited empirical research focuses on examining theimpact of external and internal stressors on the personal and relational well-being of CNM54individuals. Borgogna et al. (2021) suggested higher levels of depression and anxiety amongCNM individuals regardless of their relationship status compared to non-CNM individuals. Theirfinding suggests notable mental health discrepancies among CNM individuals compared to thosewho did not engage in CNM relationships. In addition, CNM individuals were more likely toself-identify as gender/sexual minorities, and experience higher rates of emotional/physicalabuse and sexual assault in the past 12 months compared to non-CNM individuals (Borgogna etal., 2021). It should be noted that the mechanisms behind the high reports of intimate partnerabuse (IPV) and sexual assault remain unknown and need further research. One possibleexplanation is that CNM individuals may have more knowledge related to IPV and consent,given their open and continuous communication on relationship rules and contracts (Borgogna etal., 2021). Such knowledge may benefit them with regard to reporting experiences of IPV andsexual assault. However, the study provided valuable insight into CNM being an additive stressorto mental health concerns (i.e., depression), as CNM individuals report higher rates of depressioncompared to those who were dating or married/partners, regardless of the participant's racialidentity, gender identity, and sexual orientation (Borgogna et al., 2021). Witherspoon andTheodore (2021) also suggested that CNM-related minority stress can predict an increased levelof psychological distress, such as depressive and anxiety symptoms. Such findings are consistentwith the minority stress process in which minoritized identities add unique stress and contributeto additive effects on mental health concerns.One study examined the relationship between internalized negativity toward CNM andrelationship quality. Moor et al. (2021) found that individuals engaging in CNM who expressnegative attitudes toward CNM and personal discomfort with CNM (e.g., wanting to changerelationship styles, perceiving CNM as unnatural) also report lower levels of relationship55satisfaction and satisfaction with romantic and sexual relationship agreements with their partners.In addition, CNM negativity significantly predicted lower commitment to the primary partner(Moors et al., 2021). The findings highlight how proximal factors (i.e., internalized oppressiveideologies) can contribute to minority stress, which negatively affects CNM relationships.Minority Stress for Nonheterosexuality and PolyamoryAlthough sexual orientation and relationship orientation are two distinct concepts, manyargue that nonheterosexual individuals (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual) and people who engage inCNM (e.g., polyamory, open relationships) share some parallel minority stress process(Borgogna et al. 2021; Moors et al., 2021; Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). Under the minoritystress framework, both groups can face stress due to stigma, discrimination, and internalizednegativity, although the sources of such are distinct since they challenge different underlyingsocio-cultural norms, namely heteronormativity and mononormativity, respectively (Witherspoon& Theodore, 2021). For example, concealment of identity/relationship, expectations of familyand social rejection, and experiences of political and social discrimination are common amongboth non-heterosexual individuals and CNM practitioners, which may lead to internalization ofhomophobia and mononormativity and negative consequences (e.g., lower well-being, lowerrelationship satisfaction, and mental health symptoms; Borgogna et al., 2021; Deri, 2015; Meyer,2003; Moors et al., 2021; Weitzman et al., 2009; Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). In addition,non-heterosexual individuals who endorse and engage in monogamous relationships and CNMpractitioners may hold stigmas against each other. For example, CNM practitioners may seeLGB individuals entering marriages are upholding and assimilating to hetero-monogamistnorms, which hinders the progress of sexual liberation (Aviram & Leachman, 2015; Marsh,2021), whereas LGB individuals may believe that CNM can threaten the efforts LGBTQIA+56have made to gain legal, social, and cultural legitimacy and that CNM can increase social,sexual, and ethical risk-taking (Cardoso, 2014; Mogilski et al., 2020).Furthermore, other aspects of identity can also affect the minority stress processesnonheterosexual and CNM individuals experience. For example, it is theorized that sexualdouble standards may contribute to higher levels of perceived anti-CNM stigma among women(Rubin et al., 2014). In addition, the narrow sample size of White and middle-class participantsin CNM research may also contribute to the absence of individuals with other identities in theCNM community (Pallotta-Chiarolli 2010; Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020). The lack of representationof diverse racial, gender, religious, and social class identities can lead to the perpetuation of thepopular belief that only White and middle-class individuals practice CNM and to the furthermarginalization of those who may not fit the stereotype (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020). In fact. Whitepolyamorous communities frequently fetishize, exoticize, and exclude CNM individuals of color(Patterson, 2018; Shef & Hammers, 2011). Racism and sexism also exist in the queercommunity, which contribute to the exclusion, microaggression, and stigmatization experiencedby LGBTQIA+ individuals who do not fit the Eurocentric ideologies of queer identity (Le &Kler, 2022; Patel, 2019). For example, the internalization of negative views about Asian men’sattractiveness affects the perceived desirability of queer Asian men (Le & Kler, 2022). Therefore,nonheterosexual individuals and CNM practitioners may face stigma and discrimination fromdifferent but paralleling directions based on their other aspects of identity within their owncommunity.The intersecting aspects of identity further complicate the minority stress process for gay,lesbian, bisexual, and pansexual CNM practitioners. For example, the legalization of same-sexmarriage can promote social acceptance and cultural legitimation of nonheterosexuality.57However, distancing from CNM including polyamory and demanding poly-marriage equality canlead to the assumption that all non-heterosexual individuals are monogamous and themarginalization of alternative relationship formations within the LGBTQIA+ community(Klesse, 2018; Zimmerman, 2012). Therefore, a new hierarchy was established within thecommunity, where the “good gays” are looking for monogamy and marriage whereas the “badqueers” reject assimilating to monogamism (Eades & Vivienne, 2018). In addition, thestigmatization of bisexuality and pansexuality can be exacerbated when one bisexual orpansexual individual engages in CNM (Witherspoon et al., 2019). This is consistent with theprejudice against bisexual and pansexual people by heterosexual and lesbian/gay people due topromiscuity stereotypes and illegitimacy of sexual identity (Barker et al., 2012; Brewster &Moradi, 2010; Klesse, 2005).Furthermore, race, gender, and socioeconomic status can add intersectional bias anddiscrimination against LGBTQIA+ individuals (Mereish et al., 2022; Shangani et al., 2019;Williams et al., 2020). Specifically, individuals with both sexual and gender minority identitiesare susceptible to greater exposure to minority stress, which resulted in higher risks of worseningmental health (Williams et al. 2020). Sexually minoritized adults with an African American orLatinx identity reported greater anticipated stigma compared to their White counterparts, andAfrican American sexual minority with a lower socioeconomic status experienced a higherdegree of enacted stigma (Shangani et al., 2019). Until recently, one study has examined theimpact of intersectional minority stressors on depressive symptoms among sexual and genderminority adolescents of color (i.e., Mereish et al., 2022). The findings suggest that intersectionalminority stressors indirectly influence depressive symptoms through lower self-esteem and asense of mastery of identities among sexual and gender minority adolescents of color (Mereish et58al., 2022). Therefore, it is possible that individuals with multiple marginalized identitiesexperience complicated intersectional minority stressors as they maintain their CNMrelationships.Resilience and Minority StressResilience is defined as the quality of surviving and thriving in adversity (Meyer, 2015).Therefore, some suggest the use of the term resilience should only be used “when referring to theprocess or phenomenon of competence despite adversity” (Luthar et al., 2000, p. 554). Resilienceis an essential part of the minority stress process given that it only has meaning when oneencounters stress (Meyer, 2015). On the one hand, distal stressors refer to external forces, such asday-to-day discrimination, microaggressions, and chronic strains, which may create a diversity ofanti-CNM stigma leading to intensifying the negative effects on the lives of many CNMpractitioners (Meyer et al., 2015; Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2010; Shef, 2014). On the other hand, theproximal stressors, which focus on stressors a person experiences through internal cognitiveprocessing of lived experiences, implicate that the level of proximal stress may be linked to one’scoping and resilience (Meyer, 2015). Hypothetically, in the face of marginalization based onsexual orientation (homo/bi phobia) and relationship structure (anti-poly/CNM), one maydevelop a greater capacity to cope with experienced minority stress (Cyrus, 2017). For example,individuals in polyamorous relationships may utilize and develop resiliencies o mitigate theimpact of the negative effects of stigma and discrimination (Sheff, 2016). Some scholars alsoargued that layers of cultural identity might be sources of resilience against the negative effectsof stigma-related stressors (Balsam & Mohr, 2007; Figueroa & Zoccola, 2015; Hill &Gunderson, 2015). In addition, commitment and engagement to one’s community can also be a59source of social support that buffers the effects of stressful life experiences (Hobfoll et al., 2002;Meyer, 2003).It is important to note the distinction between individual- and community-basedresilience (Meyer, 2015). Individual-based resilience can be constructed from the concept ofmastery (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978), personal qualities (e.g., powerlessness, helplessness, locusof control; Rotter, 1966; Seeman, 1959; Seligman, 1975), personality traits, and worldview(Antonovsky, 1979). Existing literature suggests no differences in relationship quality betweennonheterosexual individuals and their heterosexual counterparts and between CNM practitionersand monogamist couples (Bricker & Horne, 2007; Hoff et al., 2010; LaSala, 2004; Parsons et al.,2012; Séguin et al., 2017; Stults, 2019; Whitton et al., 2015). It is hypothesized thatnonheterosexual or CNM individuals may have developed resilience to withstand and even thrivein the face of social stigma and discrimination (Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). For example,CNM participants may focus on developing personal and relationship skills (e.g., self-reflection,emotion regulation, and open communication) to cope with the challenges of creating andsustaining multiple romantic/social/sexual relationships (Labriola, 2010; Sheff, 2014). However,with numerous hypotheses so far on the buffering effect of resilience on the harmful anti-CNMeffects, only one study investigated resilience factors that are against the negative effects ofanti-CNM stigma and discrimination (Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). Specifically, mindfulnesscan reduce psychological distress and minority stress through both direct and moderating effects.In addition, cognitive flexibility positively predicts psychological stress and strengthens theinfluence of minority stress on psychological stress, suggesting that greater cognitive flexibilitymay lead to increased anticipation of stigma and discrimination which in turn exacerbates stress(Brewster et al., 2013; Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). However, the level of psychological60stress is not associated with either a positive CNM identity or a connection to the CNMcommunity (Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). These findings seem inconsistent with theminority stress theory that identity can be a source of strength to attenuate stress and thatcommunity can be a source of social support to overcome life challenges and obstacles (Hobfollet al, 2002; Meyer, 2015). Therefore, further research needs to be conducted to explore the effectof these resilience factors against anti-CNM stigma and discrimination.Individual-based resilience bears an important value in lessening psychological stress andstrengthening relationship well-being for minoritized individuals (e.g., nonheterosexual,polyamory). However, Meyer (2015) cautioned limitations to overly focusing onindividual-based resilience, suggesting that it can potentially perpetuate meritocracy andindividualism, and thus lead to an attitude of blaming the victim (Meyer, 2015). As minoritystress theorizes the negative influence of social stigma, prejudice, and discrimination on thehealth of minoritized populations, attention should be given to correcting the “pathogenic socialenvironment” (Meyer, 2015, p.51). Community-based resilience can be understood as thecapacity that communities have to further help individuals to develop and maintain well-being(Hall & Zautra, 2010). For example, tangible and intangible resources within a community (e.g.,role models, community centers, support groups, affirmative care clinics) can provideopportunities for social and legal support and for the reframing of social values and norms(Crocker & Major, 1989; Meyer, 2015). Community-based support can also mobilize resourcesand advocate for equality (e.g., same-sex marriage) to achieve changes on the national level(Meyer, 2015). Therefore, in theory, community-based resilience can help minoritizedindividuals to mitigate minority stress in different contexts and at different levels.61It is important to note, however, that community resilience is not equitably accessible toall members of the community. For example, Meyer (2015) suggested that social identity (e.g,non-heterosexuality, polyamory) and affiliation with the related community can influence theextent of community resources to which one member can access. Identification with andengagement in a community can be crucial steps to benefiting from community resilience. At thesame time, structural inequalities within one community (e.g., racism, bi/pan phobia, sexism) canlimit certain members in identifying and affiliating with the community and deny their access tocommunity resilience. To better understand the resilience of nonheterosexual individuals inpolyamorous relationships, Pallotta-Chiarolli and Pease (2014) proposed the term “situatedagency” (p.35) to scrutinize the intersection of political, economic, social, cultural religious, andhealth systems and their restraints on individuals’ effort to maintain wellbeing. Therefore, it isimportant to consider sociodemographic factors, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, andsocial class, when conceptualizing community resilience.SummaryWith a growing research interest in CNM, limited studies focused on the relationshipquality of CNM practitioners and the factors that influence relationship quality. It is suggestedthat CNM practitioners have the same level of, or even higher, relationship satisfaction,compared to monogamous couples (Balzarini et al., 2019; Séguin et al., 2017). As CNMindividuals face unique stressors within their relationship (e.g., negotiation on relationshipcontract/rules, maintaining multiple romantic relationships) and from society (e.g., anti-CNMstigma, discrimination), exploring how CNM practitioners maintain their relationship qualityunder a minority stress framework can provide valuable insights into the improvement of thefunctioning and wellbeing of CNM relationships and those within. Although prior research62quantitatively examined relationship quality across different types of CNM (e.g., Moor et al.,2021; Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021), the current study aims to deepen our understanding ofthe factors that influence CNM relationship quality through qualitative inquiry. In the followingchapter, I will discuss in detail the methods used for the current study, including research design,data collection, and data analysis.63Chapter Three: MethodsThe purpose of the current study is to explore the polyamorous relationship experiencesof lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals (LGBP). Under the framework of minoritystress theory, I will use interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) to explore the livedexperiences of LGBP individuals with regard to the meaning ascribed to the establishment andmaintenance of their multi-partnered relationships. For this chapter, I will discuss mypositionality, including how my intersecting identities and related experiences influence thedesign of the current study and how I plan to minimize such influence during the researchprocess. Then I will discuss the research methods, including a brief review of minority stresstheory as the theoretical framework, proceeded by the history and relevance of IPA, researchprocedure, data collection as well as analysis, efforts to ensure the validity and quality ofresearch, and ethical considerations.PositionalityAs a form of establishing trust and researcher reflexivity in qualitative inquiry, it iscritical for researchers to situate their experience and identity with the constructs and populationto be researched (Holmes, 2020). Therefore, I provide a statement of positionality that includesmy personal and professional connections to the study of LGBP polyamory. My positionalityincludes professional experiences in the classroom and in the conduct of relationship research, aswell as, personal experiences in my family of origin, current relationship, and sense of self. To begin, I co-instructed a sexuality counseling class with primarily couple and familycounseling masters students, which kindled my research interest in the relationship experiencesof lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals in polyamory. With existing stigmas andbiases against consensual non-monogamy in society, pop culture, and the field of relationship64counseling (as outlined in Chapter Two), limited empirical evidence indicating high levels ofrelationship quality among CNM practitioners led me to question the socially and culturallyaccepted perceptions of CNM. I grew an intellectual curiosity to investigate the lived experiencesof individuals in CNM relationships, which may add more knowledge of CNM relationships tocounselors and the public. After reviewing the current literature on CNM, I identified theresearch gap through in-depth explorations of lived experiences in polyamorous relationships. Asa member of the LGBTQIA+ community, I designed my dissertation to focus on exploring thepolyamorous relationship experiences of LGBP individuals and the meaning-making attached torelationship maintenance experiences. Throughout the study, my own intersectional identitiesmay play a complex role that creates both barriers and connections to understanding theparticipants' lived experiences, which can also potentially influence how I analyze and interpretthe data. I was born in China and was raised in a traditional Chinese family that valuesmonogamous marriage between a man and a woman. However, witnessing several familymembers in my extended family engage in non-consensual monogamy even when they were inan assumably monogamous relationship has influenced my values on intimate relationships. Forexample, I may still have implicit biases against extradyadic romantic and sexual relationships,even though they may be consensual. Currently, I am in a committed monogamous relationship,which can also affect how I perceive relationship rules, communication between partners, andemotional as well as sexual intimacy. Therefore, as an outsider to the poly community, I must beaware of my biases and approach participants with respect and affirmation. While not activelydisclosing my relationship configuration and status to participants during the research process, Iapproached such questions with honesty and transparency when asked, followed by restating the65purpose and potential impact of the study. In addition, I face some barriers to understanding thecomplexity of American culture (e,g., metaphors, slang,) as an international student, although Ihave lived in the U.S. for four years. However, my identity as a foreign-born citizen also puts mein a privileged position where I can approach participants with cultural curiosity and humilityinstead of with established perceptions.Growing up in a working-class family, I have also been conditioned to certain work andlife philosophies that may not resonate with my participants born in a family with a highersocio-economic status. For example, the value of personal pursuits over family may contradictmy values of prioritizing family needs over my own. Meanwhile, my education in a master’s anddoctoral program in the U.S. also privileged me with more power as a researcher than theparticipants, as I will interpret their subjective experiences in polyamory. While my identity as acounselor can help me build a rapport with my participants quickly, I need to be aware of myposition as a researcher in the study and avoid providing counseling services.While I identify as an atheist, my beliefs and values are partially affiliated with Buddhismand Daoism. Therefore, I may not resonate with the oppression and marginalization thatLGBTQIA+ individuals have experienced based on Western religions, such as Christianity.Although being part of the LGBTQIA+ community, I have the privilege of not being subject toreligion-based anti-queer oppression because religious institutions do not hold sociopoliticalpower in China. Moreover, I hold male privilege and have internalized patriarchy as a cis-genderman, although I firmly stand with feminism and advocate for gender equity. My identity andsocialized beliefs and values can influence not only the interview process with participants ofother gender identities but also my analysis as interpreting the data. Lastly, as a person with no66known disability, I can be unaware of my ability-based privilege, which influences myperceptions of participants’ experiences based on their ability status. In summary, I am biased because of my experiences, beliefs, and values based on myintersecting identities. During the research process, I used voice memos to constantly check andbracket my assumptions and biases about consensual non-monogamy, including polyamory. Iwas attuned to the details that my participants shared during the interview to inquire further withhumility and curiosity, rather than my assumptions based on my own experiences. My sexualidentity as a gay man plays an important role in my decision to design the study under theminority stress framework because it interrogates the systemic oppression that impacts thehealthy development of LGBTQIA+ individuals (Meyer, 2003). Utilization of an IPAmethodology allows me to explore the in-depth subjective experiences in polyamorousrelationships (Smith et al., 2022). In the next sections, I address the theoretical framework brieflyand discuss my analytical approach in detail.Theoretical FrameworkThe minority stress model examines how social and cultural stressors impact the highprevalence of mental health issues among minoritized communities (e.g., sexual orientation,gender, race; Brooks, 1981; Meyer, 2003). The model posits that an individual with a minoritizedidentity can be subject to internal and external stressors in addition to normal everyday stressors.According to Meyer (2003), distal minority stressors refer to the susceptibility to prejudicedevents, including discrimination and violence, whereas proximal stressors refer to theexpectation of rejection and discrimination, concealment of identity in an effort to avoiddiscrimination, and internalization of oppressive ideologies. The additive effect of minoritystressors can contribute to the discrepancies in mental health outcomes that lead to67disproportionate levels of mental health symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) among minoritizedindividuals (Meyer, 1995; Meyer, 2003). The combination of external and internal stressexperienced by individuals with a minoritized status can be detrimental to personal well-being. In addition, other factors (e.g., salience, valence, and integration with one’s otheridentities) can moderate the effects of minority stressors and the emotional impact of stressors onone’s life (Meyer, 2003; Thoits, 2013). For example, these factors can be a source of strength andresilience for individuals of a minoritized status, especially when one develops high levels ofself-acceptance, commitment to community engagement to build social support, and copingskills (Branscombe et al., 1999; Meyer. 2003; Meyer, 2015; Miller & Major, 2000). However,resilience building should not depend solely on individuals as it may perpetuate the meritocracyand ignore the systemic oppression that minoritized communities face (Meyer, 2015). Therefore,building community-based resilience, centering resources and support, should also beemphasized to help minoritized individuals to mitigate minority stress in different contexts and atdifferent levels (Crocker & Major, 1989; Meyer, 2015). In the past few decades, the minoritystress theory has provided considerable theoretical value when examining the external stressorsthat influence mental health outcomes among marginalized groups (Borgogna et al., 2019;Brook, 1981; Meyer 2003). It posits that a person’s minority status can be both a source of stressand a crucial modifier of stress effect during the stress process. Rationale for Utilizing Minority Stress ModelIndividuals who identify with nonheterosexuality and polyamory face stigmatization anddiscrimination in Western society due to the violation of heteronormativity and mononormativity,respectively (Meyer, 2003; Moors et al., 2013). Therefore, individuals who are nonheterosexualand/or polyamorous experience minority stress that can influence the healthy development of self68and relationships (Moors et al., 2021; Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). For example, individualsexperiencing high levels of minority stress are more likely to report mental health symptoms,such as depressive symptoms, substance use, and suicide ideations, and poor relationship qualityas well as well-being (Cao et al., 2017; Meyer, 1995; Waldo, 1999). While the legalization ofsame-sex marriage on the federal level contributed to a steeper decline of both implicit andexplicitly anti-gay biases across the country (Ofosu et al., 2019), nonheterosexual individualsstill face stigmas and discrimination at institutional (e.g., independent contractors, religiousorganizations, and religious educational institutions) and state levels (e.g., Florida, Tennessee).Meanwhile, CNM practitioners, including individuals in polyamorous relationships face a lack oflegal and social recognition, social stigma (e.g., promiscuity, infidelity), and discriminatory lawsand policies (Haritaworn et al., 2006; Klesse, 2005; Morrison et al., 2013; Sheff, 2011; Weitzmanet al., 2009; Wright, 2014). It is theorized that such external stressors may lead to feelings ofguilt and shame for non-monogamous feelings and desires (Weitzman et al., 2009). In addition,communication and navigation related to relationship rules or contracts as well as maintenanceof attachment and commitment to multiple partners, a unique additive stressor to individuals inpolyamorous relationships, may also contribute to negative mental health and relationship quality(Deri, 2015; Weitzman et al., 2009). In fact, CNM-related minority stress predicts higher levelsof depression and anxiety among CNM practitioners compared to their non-CMN counterparts(Borgogna et al., 2021; Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). Moors et al. (2021) also suggested thatinternalized anti-CNM stigma can contribute to minority stress, which negatively influencesrelationship satisfaction and satisfaction with romantic and sexual relationship agreements withtheir partners. Based on the conceptual understanding and empirical evidence, the minority stressmodel aligns with the research goals to answer the research questions.69Specifically, the current study aims to answer the following four research questions:RQ1: How do lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals establish theirpolyamorous relationships?RQ2: How do lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals in polyamorousrelationships perceive their sexual/relationship orientations influencing their relationshipexperiences?RQ3: How do lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals in polyamorous perceivetheir sense of identity influencing their relationship experiences?RQ4: How do lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals respond to personal,relational, and societal challenges in order to maintain their relationship?It is established that heteronormativity and mononormativity influence individuals’personal and relationship well-being (Cao et al., 2017; Meyer, 1995; Moors et al., 2021; Waldo,1999; Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). Therefore, utilizing the minority stress model as thetheoretical framework supports the focus of the study on investigating how external and internalstressors influence polyamorous relationship experiences of LGBP individuals and how theyrespond to those stressors while maintaining their relationships. The minority stress modelgrounds the interview protocol and analytical approach to pay close attention to the stress createddue to participants’ minoritized statuses and to the resilience building to cope with the stress.Moreover, the minority stress model examines human experiences from a social constructivistperspective, which is in line with the IPA used for research design and data analysis.  Interpretative Phenomenological AnalysisResearchers utilize IPA to investigate personal lived experiences and the sense-makingattached to such experiences (Smith et al., 2022). In the past 27 years since Jonathan Smith70argued its scholarly importance in capturing the experiential and qualitative in 1996, IPA hasbeen used in research in health psychology, counseling, and social as well as educationalpsychology (Smith et al., 2022). According to Smith et al. (2022), IPA is a qualitative approachrooted in three theoretical axes, including phenomenology, hermeneutics, and idiography.Phenomenology is a philosophical approach that aims to investigate the experiences of particularimportance that an individual has lived. Hermeneutics refers to the endeavor of researchers tointerpret the senses individuals make out of their lived experiences (Smith et al., 2022).Furthermore, the idiographic aspect of IPA lies in its commitment to the examination of detailedexperiences of each case before moving to more general claims (Smith et al., 2022). Therefore,IPA requires researchers to be attuned to the personal account of each participant, interpret themeaning-making based on the participant’s reflections of their experiences, be aware of theinfluence of personal biases on the research process and data analysis, and gain a deeperunderstanding of each participant’s experiences that contribute to the group themes. In the nextfew sections, I will discuss in detail each theoretical tenet of IPA. PhenomenologyPhenomenology, originally developed by Husserl, concerns the meaning humans makeout of their lived experiences (Smith et al., 2022). The philosophical component ofphenomenology provides researchers with a source of perspectives on how to investigate andunderstand lived experiences. Although not directly related to IPA, many leadingphenomenological philosophers, including Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty, developedaspects of phenomenology that are relevant to IPA research (Smith et al., 2022). For example,Husserl suggested that phenomenology aims to carefully examine human experiences andidentify the essential qualities of those experiences (Smith et al., 2022). In order to reach the71aims, one needs to adopt a “phenomenological attitude” that moves oneself away from theobjects in the world to one’s perception of the objects (Smith et al., 2022, p.8). Husserl alsoargued that the focus of a phenomenological inquiry is on what is experienced in theconsciousness of an individual, which indicates that phenomenology concerns more about thesense-making of an experience, rather than the experience itself (Smith et al., 2022). Bracketing,a term coined by Husserl, refers to the effort to put one’s pre-knowledge aside in order to identifythe essence of the experiences (Smith et al., 2022). Such a phenomenological method helps IPAresearchers silence their biases, values, and perceptions in order to enter the world of participantsand try to understand their experiences on their own terms (Smith et al., 2022). According toHusserl (1927), bracketing can be achieved through a process of reductions, which involvesconstantly checking one’s perceptions and consciousness and reducing the noise in thephenomenological examination. While Husserl’s work was primarily conceptual and lackedempirical evidence, it has helped IPA focus on the process of reflection on human experiences.Heidegger’s work diverged from Husserl’s with regard to his focus on the interpretativestance, as meaning is fundamental to understanding the conscious processing of the significanceof one’s world (Smith et al., 2022). The interpretative stance is closely tied to hermeneutics sinceaccording to Heidegger, a phenomenon can not be understood without interpretation.Interpretation is central to IPA as researchers attempt to interpret participants’ meaning-makingactivities as the center of inquiry. In addition, Heidegger’s central interest was the conceptualbasis of existence, such can be objects, language, and relationships (Smith et al., 2022).Heidegger was also concerned with intersubjectivity, which refers to the relational andintersecting nature of our involvement in the world (Smith et al., 2022). Such aphenomenological concept influences IPA with regard to the view of human existence as72constantly in-relation-to somatic and semantic objects in the world (Smith et al., 2022). Carryingon the intellectual legacy of Husserl and Heidegger, Merlau-Ponty (1962) developedphenomenology in a different direction by emphasizing the embodied nature of humanrelationships to the world (a situated perspective) that leads to individuals’ unique perspectiveson the world. The implication of contextualization is crucial for IPA since the lived experiencesof researchers are a significant part of understanding the perspectives of participants. In addition,IPA researchers need to analyze the meaning of participants' experiences, even though theycannot be completely captured or reflected (Smith et al., 2022). Both Heidegger andMerlau-Ponty emphasized the importance of interpretation in phenomenological inquiry, whichis another theoretical underpinning of IPA: Hermeneutics.HermeneuticsHermeneutics theorizes methods for interpretations, which is the sense-making process(Smith et al., 2022). Hermeneutics was initially developed to provide foundations for interpretingbiblical texts but later was used for a wider range of texts, including historical and literary texts(Smith et al., 2022). Notably, Heidegger (see the previous section), Schleiermacher, andGadamer contributed to the hermeneutic component of IPA (Smith et al., 2022). Schleiermacherinvoked the terms grammatical interpretation (the objective meaning of texts) and psychologicalinterpretation (the author’s individuality; Smith et al., 2022). Both terms are linked to IPA sincethe researchers attempt to not only report the participants’ interpretations of their livedexperiences but also offer meaningful insights that are beyond the participants’ claims (Smith etal., 2022). One caveat is that IPA researchers should refrain from viewing their analyses ofparticipants’ experiences as being more true than those of the participants (Smith et al., 2022).Gadamer’s hermeneutics primarily focused on historical documents and literary works (Smith et73al., 2022). The hermeneutic phenomenologist argued that one could only know theirpreconceptions until they start the interpretation, which points out the dynamic process of IPAanalysis of data (Smith et al., 2009). While IPA researchers may acknowledge somepreconceptions and their influence before entering and interpreting participants’ experiences,many may emerge during the process (Smith et al., 2022). As researchers’ preconceptions will beinevitably present, engaging the dialogue about the position between researchers themselves andthe texts is crucial to avoid those preconceptions hindering the interpretation process (Smith etal., 2022). Gadamer’s point echoes the importance of bracketing as IPA researchers need toconstantly check their beliefs, values, and perceptions of the phenomenon of inquiry in order todo justice to the accurate interpretation of participants’ experiences. The hermeneutic circle, which describes the dynamic and non-linear thinking process ofinterpretation, provides a useful method for IPA research (Smith et al., 2022). Essentially, itfocuses on the “dynamic relationship between the part and the whole” such as between a wordand a sentence within which the word is used, a single extract and a complete test, and theinterview and the research project (Smith et al., 2022). IPA researchers engage in thehermeneutic circle by analyzing the data through different perspectives and understanding themeaning at different levels (Smith et al., 2022). Hermeneutics is central to IPA since it is aninterpretative phenomenological approach to interpreting the interpretations of participants’ livedexperiences.IdiographyThe final theoretical component of IPA is idiography, which focuses on the particular(Smith et al., 2022). Specifically, IPA is committed to two levels of particular, namely in-depthanalysis of the particular and a deep understanding of how a particular phenomenon is74interpreted by particular individuals in a particular context (Smith et al., 2022). Therefore, ratherthan concerning generalizing rules of human behaviors, IPA locates such generalizations in theparticular and develops them with more caution (Smith et al., 2022). The idiographic tenet ofIPA requires researchers to recruit a small sample of participants with a purposive and situatedmethod (Smith et al., 2022). Smith et al. (2022) caution that a large sample can lead IPAresearchers to focus on the whole and generalization of findings while neglecting the details ofindividual experiences. As such, IPA prioritizes the detailed analysis of particular cases of livedexperiences of individuals, which adds valuable insights into the phenomenon being studied.Rationale for Utilizing Interpretative Phenomenological AnalysisThe three theoretical components of IPA, namely phenomenology, hermeneutics, andidiography, aligns with the research purpose and research questions. While a quantitative methodmay help examine different aspects of polyamorous relationship experiences among LGBPindividuals, phenomenology supports exploring the experiences that are significant to LGBPindividuals maintaining their polyamorous relationships. Such nuances in relationshipmaintenance experiences have important implications for counselors to approach LGBP clientsin polyamorous relationships with cultural humility after understanding the diversity inpolyamorous relationship experiences. In addition, hermeneutics allows answering the questionsrelated to the meaning that LGBP individuals make out of their polyamorous relationshipmaintenance experiences. Hermeneutical phenomenology helps me pay close attention to howparticipants understand the events, incidents, resources, and people that happened in their livesand allows me to add my interpretations that may exceed their claims during the interview.Finally, since polyamory is not a normative relationship experience in Western society, attendingto the details of individual particular experiences is rational. Taking an idiographic stance, I step75away from pre-established knowledge of polyamorous relationship quality to focus on theindividual’s subjective account of their unique experiences. Research ProcedureUpon the passing of the dissertation prospectus hearing and obtaining approval from theVCU Institutional Review Board (HM20025919), the research recruitment information was sentto LGBTQIA+ and polyamory organizations (e.g., SAIGE, Polyamory Virginia) to inquire aboutinterest in sharing research information (i.e., research flyer) among their members. Individualswho had met inclusion criteria and expressed interest in participating in the study based on therecruitment email and flyer were sent the participant information sheet (see Appendix D) toreview the process of research participation and ask questions or concerns. After participantsconfirmed that they had fully understood the research study and their involvement via email,semi-structured interviews were scheduled and conducted remotely via Zoom. Each participantwas offered a $15 Amazon gift card after the interview as compensation for their time. Theinterview was audio recorded for verbatim transcription, which was then sent back to participantsfor reviewing and editing. Upon receiving the verified transcript, I conducted the coding andtheme categorization for each individual case and then collaborated with the research teamconsisting of two then-doctoral students and the dissertation committee chair in the CounselorEducation and Supervision program at Virginia Commonwealth University on identifying groupexperiential themes. In addition, the themes and commonalities were sent back to participants formember checking before the completion of data analysis. RecruitmentConvenience sampling was utilized for participant recruitment, including contactingLGBTQIA+ and polyamory organizations, social media, and word of mouth. Specifically, the76research participation request email (see Appendix A) and research flyer (see Appendix B) weresent to LGBTQIA+ and polyamory organizations (e.g., SAIGE, Virginia Polyamory) to inquireabout their interest in sharing the research information among members. One request email wassent to each organization, which had full autonomy to decide whether they would assist inresearch recruitment. The organizations that supported research recruitment shared researchinformation on their official website, social media platforms, and/or group chats. In addition,snowball sampling was used as the other primary recruitment method. Specifically, participantswho completed the interview had the autonomy to share research information with individualswho might be interested in or benefit from participating in the study. In order to avoid potentialcoercion to individuals with whom I socialize to participate, sharing of study information on mypersonal social media was not used as a recruitment method. All recruitment methods aredesigned to recruit diverse populations within the LGBP polyamory community with carefulethical consideration.Research ParticipantsThe current study attempted to recruit 10-15 participants. The number of participants wasslightly beyond the recommended number of participants (n<10) by Smith et al. (2022). Theauthors suggested approximately six to 10 interviews for professional doctorates as such anumber of interviews can yield rich data for analysis. For example, Farmer and Byrd (2015)interviewed 10 participants to explore genderism and gender binarism within the LGBTQIA+community. Nevertheless, the rationale for recruiting 10-15 participants in the current study wasto include diverse perspectives on polyamorous relationship experiences based onintersectionality. Such rationale was also supported by existing literature (e.g., MacLeod et al.,2017; Petalas et al., 2015).77Regardless, IPA aims to explore the subjective experiences of a phenomenon and themeaning attached to it (Smith et al., 2022). Therefore, the goal of the current study is toinvestigate the meaning of LGBP individuals with regard to their polyamorous relationshipmaintenance experiences for theoretical transferability rather than to generalize knowledgeinferred from findings based on a large sample. Moreover, IPA values quality over quantity andrequires time, reflection, and dialogue throughout the research process (Smith et al., 2022).Therefore, with the timeframe of the study in mind, a number of 10-15 participants was rationalfor a high degree of commitment to the recruitment, interview, transcription, and data analysis.Lastly, the research population is LGBP individuals in polyamorous relationships, who are asmall population (the estimated percentage of current CNM practitioners in the U.S. is about4%; Haupert et al., 2017) and often conceal their sexual, affectional, and/or relationshiporientations due to fear of stigmatization and discrimination (Conley et al., 2013a). It will bechallenging and time-consuming to recruit a large number of participants for qualitativeinterviews. In sum, the number of 10-15 participants was determined based on the nature of IPA,the degree of commitment to analysis, and the complex phenomenon of the polyamorousrelationship experiences of LGBP individuals. In order to participate, Individuals needed to meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) beat or above the age of 18 at the time of participating in the study, (2) self-identify as lesbian, gay,bisexual, or pansexual, (3) be in a polyamorous relationship, (4) be able to complete theinterview in the English language, and (5) live in the U.S. at the time of participating in thestudy. Individuals who failed to meet the inclusion criteria were excluded from the study. Theinclusion criteria were crucial to answer the research questions that aim to explore theexperiences of and meaning ascribed to the maintenance of multi-partnered relationships. The78decision to limit the research focus on the polyamorous relationship experiences of LGBPindividuals living in the U.S. aligned with the suggestion from Smith et al. (2022) that IPA needsa certain degree of homogeneity in the population of research (e.g., sexual/affectionalorientation, relationship status, country of residence). However, Pallotta-Chiarolli (2010; 2020)also hypothesized that the narrow sample size of White and middle-class participants in CNMresearch might contribute to the absence of individuals with other identities in the CNMcommunity (e.g., race, gender, religion, socioeconomic status), which further marginalization ofthose who may not fit the stereotype. Therefore, I acknowledged that individual experiencescould vary depending on not only their intersecting identities but also the social, political, andcultural climate of the geographic location in which a participant resided in the U.S. As IPA alsoaims to analyze the convergence and divergence within the data to examine variability within thepopulation of research (Smith et al., 2022), I made efforts to achieve diversity in the populationof research so that participants can share their diverse experiences in maintaining theirpolyamorous relationships.Data Collection and AnalysisData CollectionTo collect data, a total number of 17 semi-structured virtual interviews for 15 participantswere conducted via Zoom with all participants. Specifically, 13 participants completed theinterview in a single setting, and two participants completed the interview in two settings. Oneparticipant was excluded from the study after the interview due to questions about the validityand reliability of what had been shared during the interview. Therefore, the final number ofparticipants included in the study and data analysis was 14. The time of the interviews for eachparticipant ranged from 62 to 133 minutes. One participant also provided additional information79via email after completing the interview, which was included in the data for later analysis.Virtual interviews were selected in order to reach participants residing in other states in the U.S.and for safety and privacy considerations. A VCU-affiliated Zoom account is consideredethically acceptable to complete interviews and collect data by the VCU Institutional ReviewBoard. All interviews were both audio and video recorded, which is a default recording methodby Zoom. Video recordings were deleted immediately after the interview, and only audio fileswere stored securely for transcription.The interview process followed the protocol consisting of a preparation script, interviewquestions, demographic questions, and an ending script (see Appendix C for interview protocol).The preparation script is to ensure that participants fully understand the interview process as wellas the participant information sheet and confirm their willingness to proceed with the interview.The interview started once the participant consented to be recorded, during which a total of 10interview questions were asked to explore the meaning of lived experiences in establishing andmaintaining multi-partnered relationships.Specifically, To answer research question one “How do lesbian, gay, bisexual, andpansexual individuals establish their polyamorous relationships,” the following three questionswere asked, “Could you describe your journey to enter polyamory?” “What communications didyou have with your partner(s) when entering polyamory?” “What suggestions do you have forfolks who are considering polyamory?” In addition, questions two “How do lesbian, gay,bisexual, and pansexual individuals in polyamorous relationships perceive theirsexual/relationship orientations influencing their relationship experiences?” and question three“How do lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals in polyamorous perceive their senseof identity influencing their relationship experiences?” are interconnected as both questions aim80to explore how participants’ sense of intersecting identities influence their perceptions of self andrelationship experiences. Therefore, the following four interview questions were asked duringthe interview to answer both questions: “Could you describe your current relationshipstructures?” “In what areas are you satisfied in your relationships?” “What other experiencesrelated to your sexual orientation and polyamory have influenced the way you see yourself?”“How do you see those experiences influence your relationships with multiple partners?” Lastly,to explore the question of “How lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals respond topersonal, relational, and societal challenges in order to maintain their relationship,” the followingthree interview questions were asked, “What challenges do you face maintaining yourrelationships with multiple partners?” “How do you address the challenges as you maintain yourrelationships with multiple partners?” “Could you share your coming-out journey?”In addition, prompts and questions on the spot were utilized following IPA interviewguidelines by Smith et al. (2022) based on the lived experiences shared by each participant. Thisapproach was in line with the goal of my study using IPA to inquire about the subjectiveexperience of participants in their polyamorous relationships at an individual level. Utilizingprompts and questions on the spot also created spaces and opportunities for each participant toshare the deeper and unique meaning of their polyamorous experiences given the diversity inpolyamorous relationships.To ensure privacy, participants were advised against mentioning real names during theinterview and were able to choose a pseudonym at the end of the interview. Out of 14participants, 12 chose their own pseudonyms that were used to place their real names ifmentioned in interviews, and two participants requested me to assign pseudonyms for them.While the interview was less likely to cause greater than minimal risks to participants, mental81health resources were sent to participants via email upon the completion of the interview toaccess national mental health hotlines. Each participant was offered a $15 Amazon gift card ascompensation for their time upon the completion of the interview, and two participants chose toparticipate without compensation.All video recordings were deleted immediately after the interview, and audio recordingswere stored on the VCU-affiliated Google Drive account of the dissertation committee chair forverbatim transcription. Out of 16 interview recordings, 12 were transcribed by me, one by thedissertation committee chair, and three were sent to Panda Transcription, a third-partytranscriber, for transcription. Transcripts were sent back to all participants for reviewing andediting, and eight participants completed the process and returned the verified and editedtranscripts. Data analysis proceeded after the member-checking procedure.Data AnalysisMicrosoft Word and Excel were utilized for data analysis. Specifically, Microsoft Word, aword processor that fits the goal of IPA in the organization of data analysis, was used during thesingle case coding process of data analysis (Smith et al., 2022). Microsoft Excel, a spreadsheetprogram, was used to organize Personal Experiential Themes and cross-case data analysis. In thefollowing section, I detail the specific data analysis process that follows the seven stepssuggested by Smith et al. (2022).Step 1: Reading and Reading the TranscriptsReading and rereading the data is crucial for an immersive experience and activeengagement with the original data, which is also the foundation for gaining an understanding ofthe life stories of the participants (Smith et al., 2022). I listened to the audio recordings regularlywhile reading the transcript to reflect on the voices of the participants during the interview,82which assisted me with a more comprehensive analysis (Smith et al., 2022). Meanwhile, Irecorded voice memos about my recollections of the interviews and my observations of thetranscript while reading the transcript to capture the data and track their potential influence onsubsequent analyses (Smith et al., 2022). Thoughts and feelings associated with the recollectionsand observations were also recorded in order to bracket them from biasing my analysis andinterpretation of the data. In addition, I regularly discussed with my dissertation committee chairmy reflections on the lived experiences of participants to identify my biased and bracket themfrom the following data analysis procedure. In sum, repeated reading aimed to facilitate thedevelopment of the overall interview structure and a deep understanding of how narrativesconnect sections of an interview together (Smith et al., 2022).  Step 2: Exploratory NotingThe exploratory noting step is similar to a free textual analysis, which allows me toannotate the transcript with an open mind and note anything of interest within it (Smith et al.,2022). This step was completed on Microsoft Word, as Smith et al. (2022) suggested genericworld processing applications over specialized coding software. Specifically, I noted thecomments of participants that are closely tied to the phenomenon and identified explicitmeaning. For example, specific events, persons, and places related to polyamorous experiences(e.g., entering polyamory, relationship with a particular partner, coming-out settings) as well asascribed meanings were at the center of the account during the exploratory noting process. Inaddition, I added descriptive, linguistic, and conceptual notes when necessary (Smith et al.,2022). Descriptive notes were used to focus on the content of what the participants had sharedduring the interview, which included keywords, phrases, or explanations that the participantsused to highlight their thoughts and experiences relevant to their polyamorous relationships (e.g.,83relationship satisfaction, relationship challenges). I also used linguistic notes to explore thespecific language participants use, identify the constituents of the participants’ world, and inducethe meaning of participants’ experiences (Smith et al., 2022). This process involved noting thepauses, silence, tone, repetition, and other functional aspects of language. For example, Catrepeated the word “permissive” during the interview to imply the sense of powerlessness andhelplessness due be the public silence over anti-trans legislation across the U.S. Sylvia pausedseveral times when sharing her coming out experiences as polyamorous, which indicated hernegative attitudes (e.g., less brave) towards self because of lower levels of poly outness thanpartners. Furthermore, conceptual noting requires a more interrogative and conceptual level ofthe data (Smith et al., 2022). Since this is an early stage of data analysis, I approached the datawith questions and attempt to reach some tentative answers. To achieve this goal, I shifted myfocus to a more abstract level to analyze the participant's understanding of their experiences. Forexample, I annotated parts of each transcript with questions about what certain languages (e.g.,analogy, metaphors) of importance mean to me as well as to the participants. According to Smithet al. (2008), IPA researchers are using themselves as a tool to help make sense of theparticipants. Therefore, I used my own perception and understanding to identify the meaning ofkey events and processes for the participants. Lastly, I engaged in an analytical dialogue betweenmy pre-established perceptions of the participants’ experiences and my newly emergingunderstanding of their experiences. Step 3: Constructing Experiential StatementsConstructing experiential statements is crucial to consolidating and crystalizing thethoughts of the researcher, and the analytical focus is shifted away from the transcriptsthemselves to the exploratory notes (Smith et al., 2022). Therefore, I constructed experiential84statements in Microsoft Word for each transcript that were directly related to experiential notesattached to the participant’s experiences and the associated meaning-making. In addition, Ireorganized the data by breaking up the narrative flow of the interview and fragmenting theparticipant’s experiences in order to interpret the analysis. According to Smith et al. (2022), theexperiential statements reflect both the participants’ original words as well as their thoughts andinterpretations of the researcher. Moreover, experiential statements should be constructed fromanalytical work rather than reconfiguring the original data (Smith et al., 2022). Therefore, Iensured to construct experiential statements that were concise and abstract yet captured andreflected the understanding of participants’ experiences.Step 4: Searching for Connections Across Experiential StatementsSearching for connections across experiential statements involves chattering andclustering statements based on the researcher’s analysis of the connections among statements(Smith et al., 2022). Therefore, for each participant, I fragmented their experiential statements inMicrosoft Word in order to examine possible connections across them in a single case. I alsoremained open-minded and flexible with clustering the experiential statements, given that theycould be connected in different ways. Meanwhile, I referred back to the research questionsregularly to ensure the clustering could answer the questions. Multiple attempts were made as Imoved around experiential statements to consider the optimal way to demonstrate the mappingof their interconnections. In sum, personal experiential statements were clustered based on theircommonalities. It is worth noting that few personal experiential statements were not grouped dueto irrelevance to the rest of the themes, which was acceptable according to Smith et al. (2022).Step 5: Naming Personal Experiential Themes for Consolidation and Organization85According to Smith et al. (2022), this step involves giving a name to each culture ofexperiential statements, which then becomes the participants’ Personal Experiential Themes(PETs). In this step, I created a spreadsheet for each participant in Microsoft Excel that includesthe PETs, subthemes, and original experiential statements with corresponding page numbers inthe transcript. This supporting information helped me locate the exact place in the transcript thatgenerated the statements and offered keywords from the participant that stimulated thegenerating process (Smith et al., 2022). Step 6: Constituting the Individual Analysis of Other CasesThis step involves repeating the aforementioned five steps to conduct the analytical workon the rest of the transcripts (Smith et al., 2022). Smith et al. (2022) suggested treating eachtranscript on its own terms and as a “complete universe of inquiry” (p.99). Therefore, I cautionedagainst reproducing ideas from previous analyses, although it was inevitable to identify similarpatterns in the latter transcripts and to be influenced by prior analyses. To prevent thereproduction of ideas from happening, I again engaged in the analytical dialogue between mypre-established perceptions of the participants’ experiences and my newly emergingunderstanding of their experiences. The process was repeated until the completion of the lastindividual transcript. Upon the completion of the first six steps, 14 Excel spreadsheets werecreated that included the PETs, sub-themes, and original experiential statements of eachparticipant.Step 7: Develop Group Experiential Themes Across Cases  The construction of group Experiential Themes (GETs) involves a process of identifyingthe convergencies and divergencies across the PETs generated in Step 5 (Smith et al., 2022).Specifically, after completing the previous six steps individually, I collaborated with the research86team to discuss the connections across all PETs to process the convergences and divergences,provide a name for the group themes, and annotate the PETs to demonstrate the connections.Before developing the GETs, the research team met to process potential biases and prejudicesdue to positionality and bracket them. In addition, the research team discussed importantconcepts and terminologies related to IPA (i.e., data analysis process and goals) and polyamory(e.g., relationship hierarchy, metamour, unicorn, open/closed relationship systems). This processaimed to ensure every member of the research team understood the protocol of data analysis andapproached data with an unbiased stance.PETs and sub-themes were printed and cut into pieces so that the team could move themaround on the floor for constant comparison and contrasts to determine at which level they fit theemerging GETs (e.g., theme, sub-theme). In addition, we identified the PETs that did not fit theemerging GET to determine if they might fit together for a different GET. After the completionof constructing GETs, I examined how they reflected the participants’ experiences and answeredthe research questions, and sent them to participants for member checking. Following the sevenIPA analytical steps suggested by Smith et al. (2022), the research goal is to provide a venuewhere participants can share stories about the understanding of their polyamorous experiences ata group level while also demonstrating the individual uniqueness reflected in the sharedexperiences.Validity and Quality of the StudyVarious strategies have been taken to ensure the validity and quality of the current study.Following the interview protocol to approaching the semi-structured interviews with participants,I acknowledged the possibility of reactivity during the data collection process. For example, mypresence, including my race, gender, and body language, might have influenced participants’87responses to the interview questions. In addition, reminding participants to only discuss whatthey feel comfortable with at the beginning of the interview may have influenced participants’ways of answering the interview questions. Furthermore, encouragers such as “um-hmm,”“yeah,” and “uh-ha” could lead participants to react by either continuing on the topic or changingthe topic of the conversation. To address these concerns, I remained transparent with allparticipants during the data collection process about the purpose of the study, benefits and risksof participation, and my professional background. Using counseling attending skills (i.e., eyecontact, encouragers), I managed to create a warm and safe environment in which participantscould share their experiences without fear of being judged. During the interviews, I also utilizedsome counseling micro-skills (i.e. reflection, paraphrasing) to ensure an accurate understandingof participants’ experiences and the meaning ascribed to such experiences. As a result, a majorityof interviews exceeded the scheduled time, which indicated participants’ comfort in discussingtheir experiences in the interviews.I recorded voice memos after each interview to reflect on my experiences with theparticipants, particularly my thoughts and feelings on their lived experiences. In addition, Idiscussed my reflections during the weekly meeting with my dissertation committee chairthroughout the process of data collection and analysis. These strategies served two mainpurposes. The reflection process helped me recollect specific moments during which Iexperienced positive and negative thoughts and feelings toward participants’ experiences andidentify biases and prejudices contributing to them. During the weekly discussion, mydissertation committee chair and I also generated strategies to minimize the influence of mybiases and prejudices during the data collection and analysis.88While following the aforementioned seven steps to conduct my data analysis, it is alsocrucial to ensure the validity and quality of my study throughout the research process.Specifically, as suggested by Smith et al. (2022), I followed the guidelines of Levitt et al. (2018)to maintain the rigor and validity of my research design and practice, including maintainingtransparency, contextualizing the participants’ world, and maintaining methodologicalintegrity. Specifically, I utilized several methods to maintain transparency throughout theresearch. I shared the research purpose, research questions, and interview questions withpotential participants if requested to ensure each participant entered the interview with a clearunderstanding of the research purpose and process. Transcripts were sent to participants forreviewing and editing before data analysis. In addition, as suggested by Levitt et al. (2018), Ihave shared in detail the data collection and data analysis strategies that strictly follow theguideline of the VCU Institutional Review Board. Furthermore, I also discussed in this chaptermy positionality, the influence of my intersecting identities on research design and data analysis,and the strategies (i.e., voice memos, regular discussion with my dissertation committee chair)that I used to minimize the influence of my standpoints and positionality on analyzing andinterpreting the data.Since IPA (Smith et al., 2022) focuses on exploring the subjective experiences of aphenomenon and the meaning ascribed to the experiences, it is important that I develop thefindings that are bound to the contexts of my research participants (i.e., LGBP polyamorousrelationships in the U.S.; Levitt et al., 2018). To achieve this, in addition to giving the context ofmyself as a researcher and my relationship to polyamory, I discussed the context within whichthe study topic was construed in my positionality statement. Since it is important to consider thecontexts of data sources (Levitt et al., 2018), I limited the population of research participants to89LGBP individuals in polyamorous relationships in the U.S. with the awareness that the influenceof sexual orientation and geographic location could influence the individual and sharedexperiences of participants. As for maintaining methodological integrity, I have taken the following steps to achievethis goal. I conducted a thorough review of existing literature related to CNM, polyamory, andsexual/affectional orientation in Chapter Two to situate my study and its purpose. In addition, Idiscussed the inquiry approach and specific procedures that I used to address the purpose of thestudy. The purpose of the study, research questions, and interview questions were sent to thechair and methodologist of my dissertation committee to ensure trustworthiness. To ensurefidelity to the research participants (Levitt et al., 2018), I discussed how my own perspectivescould influence the research process and the steps taken to minimize such influences.Participants with diverse identities and experiences were recruited to increase the variations inthe polyamorous relationship experiences of LGBP individuals. In addition, I improved mygroundedness in data by engaging in analytical dialogues and recording voice memos, to ensuremy findings are rooted in data (Levitt et al., 2018). To ensure utility in achieving the researchgoals, I intentionally selected procedures helpful to answer the research questions and addressthe study’s purposes. For example, based on the review of the literature, the minority stresstheory (Brooks, 1981; Meyer, 2003) was chosen as the theoretical framework because itaddresses the stress and resilience that are relevant to the polyamorous relationships experiencesof LGBP individuals in the U.S. where monogamy is naturalized and institutionalized. Thechoice of IPA (Smith et al., 2022) as the analytical framework was in line with the purpose of thestudy to explore the subjective experiences of maintaining polyamorous relationships and themeaning made through such lived experiences.90Lastly, I followed the suggestions of Smith et al. (2022) to form a research teamconsisting of myself, two doctoral students, and my dissertation committee chair in theCounselor Education and Supervision program at VCU as a method of triangulating the analysisof data. While Smith et al. (2022) did not mention finding checking, I used member-checking bysending the GETs to participants to ensure they had captured and reflected the understanding oftheir lived experiences. With all the procedures I have taken in the research process, I amconfident that the research design and methods I utilized were appropriate to answer the researchquestions and achieve the study’s goals. Ethical Considerations        Maintaining ethical standards is a priority for me personally and professionally.Therefore, I utilized several strategies to ensure the research procedure was conducted ethically.Throughout the research process, I deferred to the expertise of my dissertation committee as theyprovided feedback on my research design and methodology to the rigor of my research and itspositive impact on affirmative counseling approaches to LGBP individuals in polyamorousrelationships. I obtained approval from VCU Institutional Review Board for my research andstrictly followed its guidelines to safeguard the participants’ privacy and minimize potentialrisks. Specifically, I ensured that the research recruitment methods did not coerce individuals toparticipate. Interested individuals received the participant information sheet that providedimportant information related to the study (e.g., the purpose of the study, participant’sinvolvement, participant’s rights, potential benefits and risks). Interview scheduling andconducting only happened after receiving confirmation from participants that they had fullyunderstood the participant information sheet and agreed to proceed with participation. During theinterview, I respected the rights, beliefs, and values of the participants, asking questions only in a91respectful and culturally sensitive manner. In addition, I also provided mental health resources toparticipants after the completion of the interview. To ensure the safety of data, interview audiofiles and anonymized transcripts were stored in the cloud (i.e., the VCU-affiliated Google Driveaccount of my dissertation committee chair). Lastly, I shared the research findings (i.e., GETs)with my participants. Cognizant of the vulnerability of the research participants in the study, Iadhered to these ethical standards throughout the research. In summary, I utilized IPA through a minority stress lens to explore the polyamorousrelationship experiences of LGBP individuals and the meaning ascribed to these relationshipmaintenance experiences. The theoretical axes of IPA (i.e., phenomenology, hermeneutics,idiography) grounded the research focus on the particular (a small number of LGBP individualsin polyamorous relationships in the U.S.), phenomenon (relationship quality), and meaning of thephenomenon. As outlined in this chapter, I followed the seven steps of the IPA data analysisguideline to analyze each particular case and compare and contrast to identify convergences anddivergences across cases to reflect unique and shared experiences in maintaining polyamorousrelationships. I am mindful of these theories and practices as writing the results of the currentstudy in Chapter Four.92Chapter Four: ResultsThe current study aimed to explore the polyamorous relationship experiences of lesbian,gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals. I utilized minority stress theory as the guidingframework and analyzed transcripts of semi-structured interviews with interpretivephenomenological analysis (IPA). Data analysis included interviews with 14 participants, whichresulted in Five Group Experiential Themes (GETs) and 16 subordinate themes. In this Chapter, Iinclude a summary of participants' demographics (see Table 1), an abbreviated table of GETs andsub-themes (see Table 2), and in-depth descriptions of GETs and sub-themes.ParticipantsA total of 15 participants completed the interview process. One participant was removeddue to the questions about the validity and reliability of responses during the interview. As aresult, the data for the current study was based on the interviews of 14 participants. The meanage of the participants was 36, with a range between 25 and 46 years. While participants werenot interviewed about the length of their polyamorous relationships, 12 participants indicatedthat they had a long-term relationship with at least one of their partners, and three participantshad less than three years on their polyamorous journey. Six participants identified as cis women,five as cis men, one as a trans woman, one as a trans man, and one as a woman and gender fluid.The majority of participants identified their affectional/sexual orientation as bi/pansexual (n =10). It is worth noting that no participant identified as lesbian, although it was not an exclusioncriterion. Although not directly asked, several participants also disclosed neurodivergence as apart of their intersectional understanding of self. The majority of participants identified their raceas White (n = 10), with two as Asian, one as Latina, and one as Biracial. Almost all participantsobtained a bachelor’s degree or higher, with a middle-class or higher background (n = 13). In93addition, the majority of participants identified as not currently religious. When asked about thesocial climate in their state of residence, only one participant perceived the level of inclusivenessof polyamory as friendly.

Pseudonyms used as names to protect participant identity.95Group Experiential Themes and Sub-ThemesAnalysis of 14 participant interviews resulted in the construction of five GETs with 16sub-themes. The GETs described the meaning participants have made in their polyamorousrelationship experiences, which include (1) polyamory is an evolving and purposeful journey, (2)poly satisfaction is a systemic experience, (3) dynamic interplay of sense of self andinterpersonal experiences, (4) interwoven personal, relational, and systemic challenges, and (5)ecological systems for relationship maintenance. Table 2 below displays the GETs andsub-themes.Table 2: GETs and SubthemesGroup Experiential Themes Subordinate ThemesPolyamory Is an Evolving andPurposeful JourneyContinuous Exploration in PolyamoryContinuous Improvement in Polyamorous RelationshipCurrent Polyamorous Structure Reflects RelationalPhilosophyPoly Satisfaction Is a SystemicExperienceMulti-Partnership Satisfies Needs and Wants in DifferentWaysPolycule Satisfaction Enhances ConnectednessDynamic Interplay of Sense ofSelf and InterpersonalExperiencesCompatibility Between Self and PolyamoryContinuous Development of IntersectionalityManaging Outness under Hetero/MononormativityInterwoven Personal, Relational,and Systemic ChallengesHegemony across Cultures within a Normative SocietyInternalization of Adversity Strains Individual andRelational Well-BeingMulti-Partnership Amplifies Relational ComplexityEcological Systems forRelationship MaintenanceOn-Going Personal Work for GrowthTogetherness in Addressing ChallengesPersonal and Relational Efforts in Managing JealousyThe Cruciality of CommunicationAccessing Resources in a Support System96GET One: Polyamory Is an Evolving and Purposeful JourneyParticipants shared how they entered polyamory and described their journey to establishthe current relationship structure that reflects their beliefs, values, and expectations ofrelationships. All participants described their continuous exploration in and reflection onrelationship experiences that facilitated their evolving relationship structure to fulfill personaland relational needs. Therefore, this GET consists of three sub-themes, including (1) continuousexploration in polyamory, (2) continuous improvement in polyamorous relationships, and (3)current structure serves particular purposes.Continuous Exploration in PolyamoryIn many of the experiences shared, participants relayed an ongoing exploration processinherent in navigating polyamory. Exploration in polyamory included the efforts and experiencesreported by participants to initiate polyamorous relationship structures, evaluate the process, andnegotiate intra- and interpersonal needs. Early exploratory stages of participants’ polyamorousjourney included participant experiences of changes in their relationship structures. Participantsdiscussed various reasons for departing from monogamous relationships. Some participantsexperienced a sense of constraint in conforming to monogamy, which contributed to explorationsof different relationship configurations (e.g., nonmonogamy, polyamory) for personal liberation.Specifically, some described feeling “distressed,” “faking,” or “trapped” in an attempt to fit intomonogamy. For example:Right around my sophomore year of college, I’d say, like my freshman year college, thefirst time I completely fell in love with two people at the same time, and I'd never heardof the concept of polyamory. And I just remember sitting with friends on the floor of thekitchen being like, “I don't understand why I have to pick. I'm equally distressed about97both of these…” It's like it, I wish I could just have an apartment and a cat with both ofthem, and that just them just being like, “Sure, okay.” I have supportive friends whodidn't understand what I was talking about. And then once stuff like those sorts of rollingcrushes constantly happening, continued to happen by the end of my sophomore yearcollege, I had discovered the term polyamory, and it kind of resonated with me. (Amy, cisWhite bisexual woman, 25, lower-middle class)Here, Amy described her frustration and confusion in the constant dilemmas of choosinga monogamous relationship in emerging adulthood before gaining awareness of the polyamoryconcept. The discovery of polyamory gave her a sense of validation of her feelings and beliefs inrelationship configurations. Later, she continued to discuss that entering a polyamorousrelationship was a significant decision to “be true to myself” and “be true to what’s happening”even with the fear of potentially losing the life that centered her monogamous relationship withher ex-fiancé. Similarly, Sylvia also echoed the same dilemma of conforming to monogamy (e.g.,“end the first relationship” “cheat”, “not let this relationship escalate”) despite uncertainty for herrelationship outlooks at early adulthood. In her early dating experiences, Cat described that shewas “faking” and “being somebody I wasn’t” as she tried to fit into the relationship expectationsand standards of monogamy. For these participants, Lynna’s sense of liberation frommonogamous constraints during consensually non-monogamous experiences was shared.I think my year of casual dating or whatever when I was just in multiple relationships andstuff, that was very much like an awakening kind of wake-up moment for me of like, oh,okay, non-monogamy is a thing you can do and it feels really good for you. It feelsnatural. It feels correct with what you're looking for in terms of your relationships withother people. It was this realization that like when I meet a new person, I love having all98possibilities on the table for where that relationship is going to go. (Lynna, cis Asianbisexual woman, 28, middle class)Lynna utilized casual dating and short-term relationships in adolescence and earlyadulthood to avoid the feelings of being “trapped” and “weird” in monogamy. Later, herone-year-long experiences in multiple relationships simultaneously contributed to her realizationof the naturalness and fitness of nonmonogamy for her expectations of flexible and organicrelationship development. While these participants discussed the sense of personal liberationthrough non-monogamous and polyamorous experiences, some others opened their monogamousrelationships to fulfill unmet needs in the dyad. For Gabe, polyamory allowed him to engage invarying explorations that were inaccessible during his early adulthood and within the dyadicrelationship with his nesting partner (i.e., partner with whom he cohabitates).I grew up in [city and state names]. The gay culture is also just particularly limiting. Ifyou don't look a certain way, if you're not white, and then, or older and wealthier, it's notlike there is really a place for you, and if you don't drink, forget about it. So having,accessing gay culture through sex and leather was pretty interesting. And it's a space thatwe could not have accessed through a monogamous relationship if that makes sensebecause those spaces somewhat require you to be of a similar open mind to those kinds ofthings…‘Cause we both wanted to connect more with gay culture. We wanted to connectmore as adults, post-graduation of school. We didn't want our jobs to be the main thing.We wanted to explore all parts of our identity, and it was hard. It was hard to try to accessit in this particular way, as our identities. And I think part of the benefit of being open isthat, like people, are more likely to connect with you in a lot of different ways. There wasa difference with when people connected with me platonically only versus when people99almost allowed them to feel an infinite possibility with us. (Gabe, cis Asian gay man, 33,middle class)This quote encompasses the challenges Gabe experienced in exploring different aspectsof gay culture due to his intersectionality and monogamous relationship. Polyamory opened theaccess to explore all possibilities (e.g., sexual, romantic, platonic) with different people. A fewparticipants also shared a similar mindset of fulfilling unmet personal needs and interests in theirdyadic relationship with other individuals. For example, Rosa’s reported only having had sexualexperiences with one person, her husband, which facilitated her “curiosity” in extradyadic sexualencounters. Dominic and his nesting partner “stumbled into” polyamory because of sexualincompatibility with different levels of sexual desire. Luna discussed how the relationalchallenges in her marriage (e.g., unsupported romantically and as a father to children)contributed to her “ultimatum” to her partner to either “reopen the relationships” or “seek adivorce.” In addition, Rachel emphasized the “stress and complication” related to “having aninactive sex life” for “over a decade” with her then-boyfriend motivated her to initiate multipleconversations on opening their relationship after marriage. It is worth noting that although sexualincompatibility contributed to the opening of monogamous relationships for some participants,all stressed the benefits of polyamory for allowing all relationship possibilities (e.g., romance,emotional connection, friendships, sex).In contrast, some participants entered non-monogamy or polyamory with an organic entryin their relationship experiences. Reports of ‘unplanned’ paths to polyamory exploration werecharacterized by openness, organicness, and experimentation. For Jack, his first triadic journey“fell into my lap.”100I was in a relationship with my ex...And so I was with [ex-partner’s name] at that time,and there was another one of our friends who we both kind of wound up having a sort ofcrush on. And that wasn't something that was new to me, because like until that point Ihad been identifying as bisexual. And so like other people who I had been in relationshipswith like, there was often an amount of, you know, like aesthetically appreciating otherpeople like, “Oh man, look!” right. But kind of having a crush on an additional personwhile I was in a relationship, and my partner also having a crush on that person, was kindof new. Uh, and it wound up, working out such that that person had a crush on both of usas well. And so it kind of just fell into my lap that way. (Jack, trans White pansexual man,27, upper-middle class)Jack pointed to the shared crush that facilitated the development of a triadic relationshipeven before he had “explicitly considered or evaluated” the concept of polyamory. He consideredthe triadic experience as “organic” and “experimental,” which aligned with his experiences ofattraction and affection in relationships. Such openness to organic and experimental experiencesin nonmonogamy also resonated with Puffin who greenlighted his then-wife to pursue anextradyadic experience with a mutual friend after she developed “a crush,” which later led to adevelopment of a triad characterized by “strong feelings” and “a very strong emotionalconnection.” In sum, participants shared diverse pathways that led them to enter a polyamoryjourney, during which they all went through the trial and error stage.Participants experienced high degrees of personal and relational challenges at theexploratory stages of polyamory. Specifically, many participants mentioned “insecurity” in selfand relationships, making “mistakes,” and “unethical” practices as they initially engaged withpolyamorous partners. For example, Glenn temporarily paused polyamory after being “hurt” by101her husband’s “infidelity” and dishonesty in extradyadic experiences. While the dyad improvedtransparency and honesty in a later extradyadic exploration, Glenn also considered it unethical.And so we ended up having a relationship with this person, it really was not ethical, but itdid bring us more experiences…The relationship wasn't ethical for a number of reasons,because they worked together and his job role was a position of power compared to hers,she was a lot younger than us, and also that person's partner didn't know. Also, I couldn’tsee it at the time, but once it was over and I gained more perspective about the situation, Icould see that I was coerced in a way. While it was happening, I felt that if I didn’t goalong with participating in this relationship, they would cheat anyway, their connectionwas clearly very strong, and they wouldn’t be able to resist, so it seemed like the betteroption for me to be involved. I also didn’t totally trust her. I was between a rock and ahard place. I think she also felt coerced in a way, I don’t think she was really interested inbeing with me, but going along with dating both of us allowed her to be with him.(Glenn, cis White pansexual woman, 43, middle class)For Glenn, the unbalanced dynamics (e.g., power, connection) contributed to a sense ofcoercion and mistrust in the triad that seemed only to benefit her husband. In addition, theirtriadic relationship also violated the ethics of consensual nonmonogamy as one partner engagedin infidelity. As such, Glenn and her husband ended the triad to avoid further “hurt” and practicepolyamory more “ethically.” Personal struggles due to unbalanced power and connections arealso echoed in Peter’s newly established polycule. For example, Peter experienced“powerlessness” “stress” and “sadness” in the early stage of his polyamorous relationshipbecause it reinforced relationship hierarchy as a barrier to his relationship goals in polyamory.While connections with partners may vary in their polycule, some participants also identified a102decrease in connections between original partners because of the prioritization of newrelationships at the exploratory stage. For Rosa, her reflection on the mistakes that the dyad hadmade at the beginning of their polyamorous journey:It was scary at the beginning because I definitely didn't wanna ruin my marriage. And Iwanted to be careful, but I also blew it multiple times. And I've done things that I shouldrun by my partner, by my husband. I prioritize sometimes partners over our… I've mademistakes. Same thing for him; he has made mistakes. (Rosa, cis Latinx bisexual woman,42, middle class)Rosa experienced fear of destroying her marriage because of the mistakes in her earlypolyamorous experiences such as the prioritization of other partners over marriage. In addition,the prioritization of new partners in the exploratory phase of polyamory exacerbated the sense ofinsecurity for some other participants. For example, Sylvia developed more insecurities andjealousy when her husband started dating his other partner because “I could tell he was reallyexcited about her.” Puffin also grew insecure in self and relationships because of the charmingcharacteristics and unknown intentions of the new metamour. To many participants, thebumpiness in the early polyamorous explorations related to personal insecurities and relationalmistakes.Contrary to some participants’ stressful experiences, a few reflected on perceivedstability, security, and confidence in their relationship as a foundation for positive experiences atthe exploratory stage of polyamory. For example,I came to it slowly through this explorative kind of process of like, “What do I want?What will create a meaningful experience for me and my husband?”... And I can say, andmy husband can, also have said this before, all of the connections that we have made in103this poly sort of way have been very satisfied, very meaningful, you know. (Elijah, cisbiracial gay man, 36, upper-middle class)Here, Elijah points to the importance of reflection on personal and dyadic needs for “intentional”polyamorous explorations that contributed to positive experiences. He stressed that open andhonest communication about desire and attraction contributed to a solid long-term dyadicrelationship in which he was able to explore polyamorous relationships that fulfill both his needsand his husband’s. Similarly for Gabe, the stability of a long-term relationship contributed to asense of feeling “secure” and “safe” between the dyad to “access the cis gay community in avery different lens and different avenue” through polyamorous exploration. It is worth noting,however, that a long-term dyadic relationship does not guarantee a smooth polyamorousexploration, especially when there is existing relationship dissatisfaction (e.g., infidelity (Glenn),frustration of inactive sex or sexual desire discrepancy (Rachel), unsupportive partner (Luna). Inspite of varying reasons for entering polyamory and experiences during polyamorousexplorations, all participants shared the commonality of continuous investment in improvingtheir polyamorous relationships.Continuous Improvement in Polyamorous RelationshipsParticipants discussed individual and relational efforts made to maintain and improvepolyamorous relationships. Relational efforts included teamwork and communication to helpestablish or manage effective boundaries. Personal efforts are characterized by self-reflection andself-education. Additionally, personal and relational areas of effort interacted to supportcollaborative efforts for deeper connection such as ongoing assessment of the needs and goals ofthe relationship. For many participants, their primary improvement in the early stage of their104polyamorous journey was an increased ability to address personal and relational insecurities. Forexample,We had set updates or just, for me and him, where we hang out and have time together,and also check-in, in specific dates there are check-ins. And then we have to talk abouthow we are feeling, how things are going through the week. You don't have to do themweekly. You can do a monthly as things progress better, but we had that. So we knew thatthat date was coming, there was gonna be specifically to talk about what has happened inthe past week and discuss openly what made you uncomfortable, what didn't. That's howwe approach that. (Rosa, cis Latinx bisexual woman, 42, middle class)Here, Rosa pointed out that the regular “check-ins” and “updates” with her husband helped thedyad to process their polyamorous experiences and “uncomfortable” feelings, which facilitatedthe “progress” of their polyamorous relationship. Similarly for Puffin, realization of theimportance of open communication in a previous polyamorous relationship facilitated hiscomfort level to be vulnerable and vocalize his relationship anxiety. His growth in confidence inopen communication later enhanced the trust level between him and his current partner, as she“began opening up a lot more about her desires and her anxieties.” In contrast, Lynna and Lunadiscussed how they “negotiate” “veto power” with their partners in open communicationcontributing to a deeper understanding of their “concern,” and “jealousy” to better navigatedyadic and extradyadic relationships. For these participants, teamwork with their partners (i.e.,communication) increased the sense of security in self and relationships.While some participants collaborated with their partners to reduce insecurities duringpolyamorous exploration, others went through the process with more individual efforts. Forexample, Glenn conducted “internal work” to increase “self-esteem” and decrease insecurities to105“make polyamory functional.” As Gabe started to address his “own insecurities” that were “lessemphasized in monogamy,” he realized that[Polyamory] means to me, is reinforcing like I have to, I am responsible in ourrelationship too making sure [partner’s name] feels important, and [partner’s name] alsois responsible for taking that energy and appreciating it. So if anything, it just kind ofhighlighted the work that we have to do for each other. ‘Cause like he'll talk “Well, youdon't get jealous or cheating.” And I told, I started to realize over time it's not… No otherperson really hurts our relationship; it's just how the two of us end up reacting andholding each other accountable or trying to hold things against each other. It's the two ofus that make or break the relationship, not anyone else. (Gabe, cis Asian gay man, 33,middle class)For him, the realization of personal and dyadic responsibility for each other led to an increasedsense of security in exploring “cis gay culture” through polyamorous experiences whilemaintaining the dyadic relationship. When Amy started exploring polyamory, her self-reflectionassisted her in recognizing the toxicity in her relationships, which motivated her to “make acommitment” to “listen to my gut more and stop letting fear make [relationship] decisions.”Following her true feelings enabled her to let relationships “develop naturally” and “cut off”relationships if “major incongruity” was identified.In addition, individual and relational efforts to improve polyamorous relationships alsoinvolved seeking education from outside resources (e.g., literature, poly groups). For example,And also outlets. We had a good resource of friends that we can reach out to wheneverwe have questions. And there is people in the group that are… They know what you're106going through at the beginning, so they're very helpful. (Rosa, cis Latinx bisexualwoman, 42, middle class)Rosa pointed to the support that she received from the poly group helped her “grab some of theirexperiences to work for me, for my marriage.” Similarly, Dominic discussed that by immersinghimself in queer culture with “non-monogamous people, he “identified, and then disidentified,and counter-identified” elements that worked for his polyamorous journey. Luna also discussedthat her “network[ing]” with different people and learning about “values,” “cultures,” and“etiquette” through the local poly community provided a sense of enjoyment in polyamorousrelationships, which increased energy for social and dyadic relationships. Sylvia attributed theimproved communication on personal feelings with her nesting partner to the “non-violentcommunication” workshops hosted by a local poly group. To these participants, access tocommunity resources added strengths and skills to improve their relationship experiences.Meanwhile, the value of literature on personal and relational improvement in polyamorousexploration was emphasized by almost all participants, which will be discussed in detail in GET:Ecological Systems for Relationship Maintenance.Furthermore, constant reflection and communication on the changing needs andexpectations contributed to the development of polyamorous relationships. For example, someparticipants discussed a shift of their expectations in polyamory experiences from sexualgratification to building various connections with extradyadic partners.At this time, the idea of a steady partner was appealing to us. Our desired situation hadevolved from just a fun sexual experience like a threesome to more of a true ongoingrelationship where we were all three partners and loved each other and could develop into107a deeper relationship between the three of us. (Glenn, cis White pansexual woman, 43,middle class)Glenn remembered a transition of relationship expectations during their polyamorousexploration after episodic nonmonogamous experiences with her nesting partner. Instead ofseeking casual sexual monogamish encounters, the dyad desired to build a triad that centered onlove and deep connection. In parallel, Gabe discussed honest acknowledgment of the “closeness”and “romantic connection” with extradyadic partners led to the dyad evolving their openrelationship to polyamory. In addition, Peter entered polyamory “flippantly” with the mindset of“hooking up” with extradyadic partners. Later after developing love and romantic connectionswith his polyamorous partner, his ideal polyamorous structure changed from “need a lot ofhierarchy” to “feel comfortable even entertaining” the theoretical conversation on polyamory to“looking for non-hierarchical” polyamorous relationships. It is common for participants todevelop new relationship expectations during their polyamorous exploration, and many stresstheir openness to different “possibilities” as they continue their polyamorous journey.Current Polyamorous Structure Reflects Relational PhilosophyThis sub-theme was constructed on the convergence and divergence in participants’polyamorous relationship structures that reflect their beliefs, values, and expectations inrelationship experiences. Particularly, participants discussed two types of relationship structurehierarchy (e.g., explicit hierarchy, de-facto) or non-hierarchy (e.g., non-hierarchy, relationshipanarchy). In addition, some participants discussed the meaning of a closed polyamorousrelationship system. For example,I am in a triad with a female and a male. Female and I started dating about two years ago.About a year into that, she expressed interest in another male. I'm pansexual myself so I108didn't really have a problem with it. He's [bi] curious, but nothing has progressed betweenthe three of us. We have a relationship where me and the female have our relationship,and then separately, she has a relationship with him…It is closed. In the beginning, therelationship that wasn’t made clear to the other male, but that was quickly brought outbetween the three of us that if I had wanted to enter into another relationship, or hewanted to enter another relationship, that the three of us would have to agree on that toprevent jealousy and really mainly prevent a sexually transmitted disease, kind of protectthe three of us. (Puffin, cis White pansexual man, upper-middle class)Here, Puffin discussed the dynamics in his current ‘closed Vee’ relationship structure andthe factors contributing to the agreement on closing the system. Later he appreciated the“egalitarianism” in relationships and the appealingness of a “close” and “strong”multi-partnership involving no “more than four people” over monogamy or open relationshipsthat were “purely sexual or friendly.” Likewise, Glen described her closed non-hierarchical triadas “very much like a marriage” where the relationship between partners was characterized bycommitment (e.g., “wedding ceremony”), togetherness (i.e., “nesting”), equality (e.g., “we areequal”) and belonging (e.g., “own our home together”). For Glen and her partners, the decisionto close the system was based on their “content with our triad” “having the commitment,”“knowing we are solid” and not having “bandwidth or interest to continually date.” The closedsystem reflected also reflected their evolved relationship expectations from having recreationalsex to building deeper relationships.In contrast to these participants who created a closed non-hierarchical system, somediscussed their non-hierarchical polyamorous relationship in an open system within which theyavoided prioritization on particular partners, even if they had a nesting partner. For example,109Rosa emphasized the dyadic intention of maintaining equal priority and importance innon-hierarchical polyamory to fulfill different needs and expectations (e.g., “relationship” vs.“simply dating”). Gabe and Cat enjoyed different types of relationships (e.g., “romanticrelationships,” “friendships” “partnerships”) in the practice of “relationship anarchy.”Specifically, Gabe described practicing relationship anarchy led to him “decolonizing ofrelationships” by “think[ing] critically” about people involved in his relationships and“highlight[ing]” different components of relationships. Similarly for Cat, the meaning ofrelationship anarchy lies in the experiences of uniqueness with “everyone” and “everyrelationship” so that she is “considering each relationship on their own terms” without “havingthe same societal and gender expectations.” Cat enjoyed immersing herself in a communitywhere relationship anarchy is emphasized to deconstruct the “colonialism” and “imperialism”that contributed to the “arbitrary social norms about monogamy” and relationships.Some participants managed to avoid emotional hierarchy during their engagement withdifferent partners. Nevertheless, a de-facto hierarchy seemed to exist in their polyamorousstructures, mainly due to cohabitation with their nesting partner or outside perceptions of thepre-established dyadic system.The thing is for us, there's a de-facto hierarchy. That the city we live in, the fact that weare both from the same place. So he [husband] is [nationality], I am [nationality], we'vebeen together for 13 years, we're married to each other, we are both very educated people.We, although each of us has different class backgrounds, we do occupy a similar kind ofclass and social economic status now. So there were things, which, de-facto to the outsideworld, make us seem like primary, does that make sense? So we don't need to be like,“Oh, he's the number one or anything,” because for any person who comes into even like110just friends or whatever, a word I have heard only use once but I think it's accurate, isintimidating, that there's a sense of a couple who are comfortable with each other, thatthere's a rapidity for where we have similar cultural references, and that can beintimidating for people who are trying to come from outside in. (Dominic, cis White gayman, 37, upper class)Here, Dominic stressed the de-facto hierarchy manifested in the intimidation tonewcomers entering the existing dyadic system in which two partners had shared cultures,backgrounds, and experiences. Later, he discussed how the dyad had made efforts to flatten thehierarchy by focusing on equitable attention to partners and removing relationship labels andrules. Similarly, Rachel expressed the dilemma between trying to practice a non-hierarchicalrelationship and outside perception of relationship hierarchy due to her marriage and relationshiplengths with her nesting partner. In contrast to outside perceptions, some participants recognizedthe natural existence of a de-facto hierarchy due to their nesting with one partner even thoughthey did not perceive an emotional hierarchy among partners. For example, I would say that the reason that we live together is not because they are my primarypartner, but the reason that they are my primary partner is because we live together, right?That necessitates, you know, a certain amount of communal decision-making, etcetera.And we have, you know, a 6-year-old kid, which is my partner’s from a previousrelationship. But the necessities of maintaining a household, and child raising togetherdoes mean that we have more involved communication on the day-to-day. Where myother partners who I have uh are not like less involved, but they're long-distance, and wedon't have the same sort of stuff going on. (Jack, trans White pansexual man, 27,upper-middle class)111For Jack, even though partners differed only in terms of the emotional connection (rather than apredetermined hierarchy), a de-facto primary partnership influenced negotiation and coordinationto balance different relationships and nesting responsibilities. In parallel, Luna discussed thereason for “classify[ing]” her nesting partner as “primary partner” from a “realistic day-to-daystandpoint” is based on more “logistical” and “emotional” support in shared lives andresponsibilities. Regardless of differing practices in the non-hierarchical relationship structure,these participants tried to strive for “equity,” “equality” and “egalitarianism” in theirpolyamorous relationships.Meanwhile, a few participants discussed the existence of hierarchy in their polyamorousrelationships. Specifically, Elijah and Lynna both explicitly identified their nesting partner astheir primary partners. For example,The way that tends to play out in other relationships that I might pursue is that myhusband is an active part of my decision-making in kind of every other relationship…Theway the hierarchy really plays out is that right now one of our rules is that every time I’mabout to take something that would be considered a next step with someone, and that canbe as minor as, \"Oh, we've been talking on the dating app and I want to give them myphone number, or we've been texting and I want to meet them in person, or this is aperson who's already a friend of mine and I’d like to take them on a date and see whathappens or something.\" (Lynna, cis Asian bisexual woman, 28, middle class)For Lynna, her marriage with her husband was an implication of a hierarchical relationshipstructure under which her husband, as the primary partner, had certain power and control in thedecision-making for her extradyadic relationships. While experiencing challenges due to aperceived loss of freedom and autonomy, she believed the structure helped her to have more112intentionality in polyamorous experiences. Therefore, her current hierarchical relationshipstructure resulted from a series of negotiations with her primary partner to balance themaintenance of dyadic marriage and freedom from the constraints of monogamy. For Elijahhowever, it was the opposite. He highlighted the importance of primary partnership as “it’s allabout the dyad” and “it all comes back to the dyad.” The hierarchical relationship structureallowed the dyad to simultaneously engage in the same polyamorous relationship where heexperienced a high level of “compersion” and “joy” as his primary partner was “desirable”“relationally, emotionally, physically” “by another person.” While polyamorous experienceswere “meaningful” and “satisfying,” they were also “extra” “like frosting on a cake” to Elijah.Such hierarchical structure ultimately strengthened Elijah’s relationship with his primary partnerby deconstructing homonormativity in the dyadic relationship through polyamorous engagementtogether. In fact, participants shared varying areas of relationship satisfaction under their currentrelationship structure. Their unique systems provide additional resources to fulfill needs andwants, which they were unable to access in their previous monogamous relationships.GET Two: Poly Satisfaction Is a Systemic ExperienceThis GET comprises two subthemes that describe the various areas of satisfaction and thebenefits of a polycule that participants experience in their multi-partnered relationships.Particularly, participants discussed their satisfaction in romantic, platonic, physical, andemotional domains. Most participants highlighted the difference in areas of satisfaction theyexperienced in polyamory rather than comparing the level of satisfaction across theirrelationships.Multi-Partnership Satisfies Needs and Wants in Different Ways113A multi-partnered relationship, to all participants, means that they can diversify theirneeds and wants across different partners. Needs and wants met in the relationships varied bypartner, were fluid over time, and included elements of support, enjoyment, pleasure, fulfillment,shared interest or identity, and connection. A majority of participants discussed how theirpartners were fulfilling their needs in different ways.Like again [nesting partner] and I really resonate in our, in our shared therapy journey. Ireally appreciate the entrepreneurial spirit of my partner, [another partner]. Heencourages me to try doing a lot of different businesses that I never would haveconsidered doing and gives me that energy and drive. I enjoy the ways that both [nestingpartner] and [another partner] have supported us all like exploring sexually. So, forexample, as [nesting partner] and I like explored early on in our sense of safety of like, atthe time, of trying gay bathhouses or going to different events. And [another partner]helps me express it by being excited about it, interested in and knowledgeable aboutgoing into public sex spaces like gay bathhouses, or bookstores, or sex bars, and whathave you, and feeling more interested in and exploring those things together. (Gabe, cisAsian gay man, 33, middle class)Here, Gabe listed different types of satisfaction with two partners based on sharedinterests, spirits, and experiences that fostered a sense of companionship. He described that hislife was “enriched” by his partners in different ways “like multivitamins,” which madecomparing satisfaction levels between each relationship like “comparing apples to oranges.”Such a mindset was shared by many other participants who denounced the quantification ofrelationship satisfaction. For example, Dominic shared having different partners who “scratcheddifferent itches” (e.g., “platonic, the academic, and the romantic, economic, and erotic” needs).114Similarly, Cat elaborated on the unique experiences she had with different partners tofulfill different needs (e.g., “math nerd” “romantic attraction” “sexual attraction”“communication” “honesty” “trust”, living compatibility with nesting partner) to explain theunproductiveness in comparing levels of satisfaction with each partner “on a ladder.” To her,varying types of relationships are “different flavor[s]” and comparing relationships was a“pressure” based on mononormativity. In addition, Cat and Jack also acknowledged satisfactionwith partners could fluctuate based on specific situations. Specifically, Cat used an analogy ofsaving one person from a sinking boat to describe the fluidity of satisfaction based on specificmoments.Who I save in that situation [from a sinking boat] doesn’t mean who I like the most. Truthbe told, in a weird situation like that, heaven forbid, I’d probably rescue a particularperson just because in terms of living situations, and convenience, and all that stuff. (Cat,trans White pansexual woman, 32, lower class)Ultimately, Cat valued the unique satisfaction each relationship could offer instead of comparingtheir levels of importance. Jack also discussed how the level of satisfaction with partnersfluctuated depending on how needs were met in specific contexts while experiencing different“affectional” and “romantic” expressions with different partners. Specifically,I think the levels of satisfaction. It feels like it varies, based on what need feels mostprominent at a given time. Right? Like when there's really something that I need or likeI'm feeling really insecure about work or something. And one of my partners is able tokind of say the right thing that makes me feel better, right, naturally, I'm going to feel alittle bit more satisfied with that partner than potentially the other 2 at that time. Right,but then, like the next time that something happens, right, and I get a different by a115different partner, it'll kind of just fluctuate in those ways that I feel like are pretty organicand natural, and I imagine that it's the same way you know, with them and their partners,including me, right when they get their needs met by those different people as well. (Jack,trans White pansexual man, 27, upper-middle class)In summary, most participants who practice non-hierarchical polyamorous relationships hesitatedto compare the levels of satisfaction with different partners. Meanwhile, some participantsaddressed the influences of intensified satisfaction with their nesting partner on theirpolyamorous experiences. For example,I would say that because of how satisfying my relationship has become with [nestingpartner], because of the fact that we have found ourselves to be sexually compatible,lifestyle compatible meaning like the family compatible, you know that sort of thing.Because we have been able to reach a certain level of satisfaction with each other and acomfort and trust level, when we do go out and explore you know possibilities with newpartners, it makes me a lot more discriminating or discerning when I do take on newpartners. And it makes it easier to determine what level of commitment there is going tobe if that makes sense. (Luna, cis White pansexual woman, 46, upper-middle class)The high level of satisfaction with her nesting partner led Luna to set higher standards forpotential partners. She would assess different areas of compatibility between potential partners,self, and current polyamorous structure to determine the worthiness of building a newpartnership. Such a mindset is also shared by Lynna who set higher standards for low-stakesextradyadic relationships and lowered expectations for companionship with extradyadic partnersbecause of a high level of fulfilled needs. This approach allowed her to withdraw fromextradyadic relationships when experiencing dissatisfaction. For Luna and Lynna, polyamorous116experiences need to add more satisfaction to the already satisfied dyadic relationship with theirnesting partner. Similarly, Puffin and Sylvia expressed their high level of satisfaction with theircurrent triadic relationship, which reduced their need to actively seek new relationships.I know that if I did develop feeling for somebody else, it's something that could be talkedabout. But I don't feel the need or the want to search outside of our relationship, because Iam getting everything I need from our relationship now. (Puffin, cis White pansexualman, upper-middle class)For Puffin, a high level of satisfaction in intimacy, romance, and trust with the current ‘closedVee’ relationship contributed to no perceived need for or interest in seeking new relationshipseven if it is acceptable. Sylvia also shared that “my needs are met by my current relationship” butwanted to have the freedom and ability to explore new interests (e.g., “go to movies” “kinkylifestyle”) with additional partners. To these participants, polyamory provided a sense ofopenness and freedom to explore new relationship experiences even if their needs are highlysatisfied in their current relationships.In addition, certain participants pointed out an increased level of sexual satisfaction intheir polyamorous relationships. For Luna, a high level of sexual satisfaction was a result ofexploring and enjoying different kinks with different partners who have differing kink skills andtechniques to elicit different sensual experiences.Definitely the sexual part of it. It's been really exciting to be able to explore differentareas of kink with different people, you know. Maybe one person is really good at impactplay, which is essentially spanking, but it can mean other things too obviously. Butimpact play. But you know, there's some people, yeah, it's something of somebody's justlike spanking you. But if somebody's really good at it and as practice different techniques117with different implements and different, you know, different things like that. And if it’swith different people, it can be a whole different experience, because they know how toelicit certain responses from you right? So that can be very interesting to explore in a waythat honestly took me by surprise. I always thought that part sounded boring, but it'sactually something I found that I really enjoy. I would not have known that if I hadn'tbeen able to explore different partners. So different areas of kink. (Luna, , cis Whitepansexual woman, 46, upper-middle class)Here, Luna pointed out the differences in kink experiences even though they all contributed to ahigh level of sexual satisfaction in polyamorous relationships. In common, Rachel commentedon the high level of sexual and intimate satisfaction with two partners that wakened long-ignoredsexual needs in previous monogamy. Specifically, she described different kinds of two kinky”itches” that her partners “scratch” that stimulate “physical,” “emotional,” and “mental”connections which led her body from “hibernation and dormancy” in monogamy into“overdrive.” Similar to Rachel's experiencing higher sexual satisfaction with non-nestingpartners, Peter also gained a sense of sexual appeal from the sexual dynamic in his non-nestingpartner’s shift of sexual preference (from “topping” to “bottoming”). In addition, Dominicdiscussed how multi-partnerships helped fulfill complicated sexual desires and needs. Puffinbriefed a stable and high level of sexual satisfaction in his polyamorous relationships. And, Gabeattributed to polyamory his access to explore sexuality and different kinks outside his nestingpartnership.It is crucial to emphasize that all participants discussed the importance of emotionalconnection with their partners, even though the level of emotional connection may vary. Forexample, Puffin was surprised by how quickly a deep connection with his current partner was118developed in a short period of time even “without constant physical attachment,” compared tohis previous experience with his wife in monogamy. In addition, Elijah and Jack described theimportance of building a connection with partners in polyamorous relationships because theywere on the asexual spectrum. For Jack, the essence of emotional connection manifested in thefact that his relationships were typically “born out of” close friendships. Elijah discussed thecruciality of connection and enjoyed “texting and having butterflies” to express his desire tofacilitate emotional experiences in polyamory. To further make his point,When I'm in connection, when you connect with me, you're gonna get a lot, you know. Isay, I'm like the advanced level, you know. And because, you know, you're, I'm going tonotice you. I'm going to observe things about you, going to care about things, about youlike. I reserve that for very few people, because of how intense that connection can be.(Elijah, cis biracial gay man, 36, upper-middle class)Here, Elijah explained he gained satisfaction and even self-growth from providing emotionalcare and support to partners in polyamorous experiences once he connected with them. To him,polyamorous encounters helped him “ convey human empathy and human connection” toextradyadic partners. As aforementioned, for all participants, the connection among partners hassignificant meaning because it opens different possibilities in their polyamorous relationships,which as many mentioned “love is not finite.”Polycule Satisfaction Enhances ConnectednessThis sub-theme reflects the special benefits participants experienced in their relationshipsunique to a polyamorous structure. Overall, participants reported belonging and joy from thesense of connectedness to a larger whole in their poly network. Many participants described their119multi-partnership as “community,” “tribe,” “family,” and “marriage,” which indicated thetogetherness and connectedness dynamic. For example,I'm not like hiding who I am, I'm having this true relationship, even though it'sunconventional and… Also I'm proud of myself for living my truth, and doing theemotional kind of work that it has taken to get here. I think it's no small thing what the 3of us have done to get here. I'm proud of us to have navigated this, there's not like a rulebook or many examples, you know. We've created a really nice life. So I am proud of it.I'm proud of myself for that. (Glenn, cis White pansexual woman, 43, middle class)Glenn pointed out the sense of pride from her polyamorous relationship. On one hand, she feltproud of herself for living authentically and creating a meaningful triad relationship through“growing pain.” On the other hand, the togetherness of the triad exploring and navigating life ina monogamous world also gave her a sense of pride. She discussed the triad had enriched her lifeby receiving multiple love, support, and intimacy from her two partners. Their recent weddingsymbolized deep connection and commitment among all partners despite the politicalunrecognition of polyamorous marriage in the U.S.For Dominic, even though his polyamorous relationship was not a closed system likeGlenn’s, commitment and togetherness across his nesting partner’s two separate relationshipswere also evident. Specifically, Dominic would have “a 10-year wedding anniversary,restatement of vows” with his nesting partner and also stand in the wedding where his nestingpartner and metamour were “getting handfasted.” Later, he discussed that despite relationshipcomplexity, the process of creating a new relationship system with more fluidity challenged thedyad to deconstruct the mononormative middle-class structure and dynamic, which in turnstrengthened the dyadic relationship.120I mean, still, like with [nesting partner], for example, I feel like our relationship actuallygot better after becoming poly. I think maybe, you know, well, the thing is though, it'slike measuring an electron right? Like the moment you measure it, suddenly it changes,because, like the very effect of like us opening our relationship, which is what we neededto do, as we became consensually non-monogamous change the nature of our relationshipbecause we would suddenly talk about it. And so changing the dynamic, challenging thekind of normality that we had internalized as to what our relationship should be, gave usthe pathway to greater satisfaction. We could be able to examine the things that you knowif we were to knock this down and start again, this institution of relationships, we couldcreate them in a way that works for us which can be more fluid. So yeah, I think I, I thinkthere is greater satisfaction. (Dominic, cis White gay man, 37, upper class)Here again, Dominic emphasized “we” during creating a new relationship structure, whichimplied togetherness and commitment both he and his nesting partner had to their dyadicrelationship besides additional ones. Such relational effort in restructuring their relationshipcontributed to greater satisfaction. Dominic’s experience resonated with Elijah who alsodiscussed that by deconstructing mononormativity together, the dyad enjoyed more openness andhonesty in their relationship and gained more “insights” into their relationship quality. As aresult, Elijah experienced greater satisfaction from relational effort in validating andstrengthening the dyadic relationship. Likewise, for Lynna, there was a perceived “recursivity”between her primary and extradyadic relationship, as her “confrontation with newness inextradyadic experiences” increases positive attitudes toward her primary partner.In addition, Dominic and Glenn's narrative indicated the differences betweencommitment in polyamory and commitment in monogamy, given the nature of a121multi-partnership. While this mindset was hinted by all participants, some explicitly discussedtheir perspectives on commitment in polyamorous relationships. In particular,I think a lot of people take commitment meaning I'm only gonna be faithful to this oneperson. But I think commitment is I am committed to making this relationship work, andnot because I wanted to work, but because it's a good relationship, like we have anexcellent relationship and I wanted it to work…I think commitment, like I believe themeaning of that word changes a lot when you're polyamorous because it's not about…Ithink a lot of people think commitment is the only being with that person. But you canmake a commitment to a friend and still have other friends. So you can make acommitment to somebody romantically, and like we have financial commitments to eachother because we own a house together, we have a child together. And those aren't gonnachange if I start dating somebody else. This commitment still remains. So my romanticcommitment can still remain. (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 46, middle class)Here, Sylvia used the friendship analogy to explain the possibility of having varying types andlevels of commitment to multiple partners simultaneously. For her, commitment in apolyamorous relationship is different from the mononormative definition of commitment asbeing faithful to one person. Therefore, she recognized the two parallel commitments that hernesting partner had: one to her, the other to her metamour. Similarly, Amy also believed thatrelationship potential in polyamory contributed to her having multiple commitments, whichdiffers from the monogamous definition of commitment. Specifically,I tell people “I don't think I'm polyamorous ‘cause I am unwilling to commit. I'mpolyamorous ‘cause I'm too willing to commit.” I'm ready to commit to multiple people.And so that's what I'm doing right now, is I'm committing to building these relationships122because they feel like they have a real potential, and they're making me very happy. I'mfeeling, I’m feeling I'm appreciated for all of the facts of my being. I feel very seen. Ihave a very fun time with them. They both make me laugh. They both think I'm funny.That's a big thing for me. (Amy, cis White bisexual woman, 25, lower-middle class)For Sylvia, Amy, and other participants, multiple commitments exist simultaneously. Theexistence of multiple commitments and connections in a polyamorous relationship also provideda sense of communality. For example,One thing I love about polyamory in our larger family is that it does allow us to go takevacations more often and easier, because things like, if we flew to [country], I go see mymom very often, the four of us could split the cost of a car way easier, you know. Or ifwe, if we went to [city] together, the four of us sharing one hotel room is extremelyviable and fairly affordable, you know. Two is not bad, two is really good, especially if,like financially if you share all the costs, but four could be really helpful. And we did fiverecently, and that was actually nice. (Gabe, cis Asian gay man, 33, middle class)Here, Gabe pointed out the communal element of polyamory manifested in the financialdistributions among partners and metamours on vacations. Later, he also shared how the sharedexperiences and understanding of otherness despite different racial identities deepenedconnections with his two partners. Similarly, Donomic also described his metamour as anextended “family member” with whom he socialized and maintained a friendly relationshipthrough his nesting partner. Luna also gained a “family perspective” or “tribe perspective”through various relationships in polyamory that bonded through “child-rearing,” “politics,” or“professional work.” To these participants, the larger family concept in polyamory helped them123navigate different relationships with partners and metamours. It was also noted that manypartners described the support they either received in polyamorous relationships. For example,Nothing will be stranger to me than being in tears on my husband's shoulder about havingbroken up with my boyfriend. That was a new experience, and I feel like, in terms of youknow it to be a book about formative poly experiences, that will be one of them. Like, oh,is it okay to be like go to your existing partner for support for a breakup with anotherpartner. Am I allowed to feel this? So that was, so that was a moment. But realizing thatthat is like, that's a great strength to be like, what is the point of having a relationship ifthey're not the people that you can turn to when you're upset right? (Dominic, cis Whitegay man, 37, upper class)Here, Dominic pointed out the relationship strength manifested in receiving emotional supportfrom his nesting partner for the dissolution of one extradyadic relationship. He later discussedhaving multiple partners also give him more insights into relationship issues with a particularpartner. In a similar way, Peter also narrated the relational support he had received from hisnesting partner when he was “at odds” with another partner. As for Luna and Lynna, their nestingpartners were like a “sounding board” to their extradyadic relationships. To these participants,the relational support signified the togetherness with partners in navigating polyamory. Forothers, the communal aspect of polyamory reduced the pressure of fulfilling their partners’ needsas they were diversified across partners. Specifically,With her having another partner, it helps kind of diffuse, I won't say burden, but somedistress on me, and trying to meet her physical and emotional needs, especially with usliving separated. She currently lives about an hour away. We spend our weekend together.But because we only saw each other two days out of the week, there was a lot of texting,124phone calls towards the beginning of relationship where she felt she needed moreemotional connection that I couldn't always provide, because with work and school andthe stress of my own things, sometimes it was difficult to keep that up. Sometimes withher being in a separate relationship, she's able to defuse that to where if I'm not available,she'll talk to him, or if he's not available because he also has a full-time job, she’ll talk tome. (Puffin, cis White pansexual man, upper-middle class)Puffin discussed how the closed Vee relationship helped diffuse his distress over his inability tomeet his partner’s needs due to long-distance and personal responsibilities. His partner havingtwo resources to meet needs in polyamory increased a perceived sense of closeness between thedyad. Puffin’s experience also resonated with Jack as he discussed how polyamorous practicesreleased the pressure of not meeting his partner’s needs for physical intimacy as they were ableto fulfill them somewhere else. Regardless of their relationship with metamours, theyacknowledged the additional resources metamours provided that reduced their own pressure indyadic relationships. For Dominic, Rachel, Gabe, and Peter, their distress over inactive sex withnesting partners was reduced or minimized in polyamory as both themselves and their partnerswere able to meet physical and sexual needs outside the dyadic relationship. For some, love withnesting partners persisted even without the sexual component.Furthermore, a few participants discussed the remaining connections with ex-partnersafter the relationship dissolution, which was the communal component manifested in the largerpoly network. Specifically, Elijah, Puffin, Sylvia, and Dominic discussed the end of a romanticrelationship had been a transition to another relationship. For example, Elijah attributed themeaningfulness of polyamorous experiences to lasting connections with extradyadic partnersafter relationship dissolution. Puffin maintained positive connections with his ex-partner and125ex-wife after leaving the triad, which to him did not fit into the operation of monogamy. Heassumed that his strong feelings toward his current partner would motivate him to continuemaintaining a different relationship if the Vee relationship dissolved. For Sylvia,And a lot of times, failed romantic relationships have become some of my best friends. Ihave two, two of my best friends were failed romantic relationships that I just remained,remained friends with them. (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 46, middle class)Here, Sylvia specified the dissolution of romantic relationships in polyamory as a transition tofriendships. For these participants, the change in the nature of relationships did not terminatetheir connections with ex-partners, as they were still a member of the larger poly network orcommunity.Lastly, compersion arose in many participants’ polyamorous relationships as theywitnessed the happiness or joy that their partners experienced in extradyadic relationships. Forexample,I love it when my partners find new people. Especially when I introduce people and theyreally like each other. I’m a very compersionate person. I don't know if you heard thatword thrown around in polyamory circles or anything. I just love seeing my partners andloved ones happy. (Cat, trans White pansexual woman, 32, lower class)Here, Cat pointed out her constant experiences of compersion from her partners’ joyfulexperiences. To her, it was part of her nature as a person. Similarly, Lynna also described a highlevel of compersion in her current polyamorous relationship because of the stability and trustwith her primary partner. In addition, Elijah described that “for compersion of my primarypartner in that he gets joy and meaning out of it, and then I get joy and meaning out of that.” Hiscompersion arose when knowing his primary partner was desired by another person and126experienced joy and meaning out of polyamorous experiences. These participants gained thebenefit of communality in polyamory by experiencing compersion.GET Three: Dynamic Interplay of Sense of Self and Interpersonal ExperiencesThis GET consists of three sub-themes that encompass the dynamics betweenparticipants' sense of themselves and their experiences in different types of relationships. Allparticipants discussed how they perceived certain compatibility between themself andpolyamory. Some reflected on their journey of exploring their intersectional identities throughtheir polyamorous experiences. In addition, all participants shared the impact of managing thelevel of outness of different non-normative identities on their relationships.Compatibility between Self and PolyamoryThis sub-theme discusses how participants perceived the compatibility betweenpolyamory and their sense of self. Compatibility included associations with sexual identity,personality, and personal values. For example,Previous to my relationship with my husband, I was with a woman for about 10 years,and prior to that, I had had male partners. So that previous relationship went a littlelonger than it probably needed to. And there were times when I felt kind of constrained,and I guess sort of missed being with men, while at the same time, I did enjoy being withher. That relationship went longer than it maybe needed to. When I ended thatrelationship and became single I kind of wondered “Is monogamy right for me? Am Ireally going to be satisfied long-term with just one partner?” And I came across that bookThe Ethical Slut…So I read that book, and I found it really intriguing and just interesting.And I thought the concept was really cool, like the ability to love multiple people, and127that that could work out, you know, ethically, and everyone would be honest, and thatwas sort of that. (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 46, middle class)Here, Glen pointed out the dilemma she had experienced in previous monogamy because of herpansexuality. After the monogamous relationship dissolved, her reflection on the relationshipconfiguration led her to seek self-education from literature where she found and personallyresonated with the concept of polyamory. During her exploration of polyamory, she continued todevelop her pansexual identity through learning and exploring. She used the metaphor of “havingyour cake and eating it too” to describe her current closed triad where she was “able to beintimate with both a man I love and a woman I love.” While she believed that her pansexualitynever undermined her capability of committing to monogamy, the happiness and fulfillment shewas experiencing in the current triad were “the best of all worlds.” The positive influence ofpansexuality on polyamorous relationships was also highlighted by many other participants.Many described pansexuality “unlock[ing] possibilities” in their relationship with partners of allgenders. For Puffin, his pansexuality led to his acceptance of a male metamour in the closed Veerelationship and openness for a possibility of a throuple relationship. Additionally, a fewparticipants discussed the compatibility between asexuality or demisexuality and polyamory. Forexample,So as a demisexual person, and this is very important and key to my experience inpolyamory, I need connections. Connection fosters, you know, both relational and sexualdesire for me. I mean, and so, which desire being different from just attraction… So forme, the demisexual component to my polyamory was really important, because theconnection is so crucial, and that's how I discovered, oh, demi and poly can work right.(Elijah, cis biracial gay man, 36, upper-middle class)128Here Elijah discussed his realization of the compatibility between demisexuality and polyamory.He remembered his struggle to fit into the hookup culture and emotional distress in theexploration of open relationships. For him, the “connection” was the central piece that connectedhis sexuality and polyamory, which led the dyad to develop meaningful extradyadic relationshipstogether. In a similar way, Rachel, Cat, and Jack discussed their need to foster connections withpartners in order to experience affection and attraction. For Jack in particular, polyamory fit hissexuality as he was able to maintain different connections with different partners without facingpressure to meet their sexual needs.In contrast, some participants also discussed how polyamory aligned with theirpersonality traits. For example, Lynna and Peter pointed outed their “flirtatious nature” in socialinteractions. Specifically, Lynna described herself as an “extremely extroverted and flirtatiousperson.”I’m a very flirtatious person, and I flirt platonically, and I flirt professionally. It’s part ofthe way I move through the world. I think there is a certain politics to informing peoplethat you are in fact sexually available when they might not have thought you were. I thinkthat always comes up for me a little bit in terms of like when telling someone that I’mpolyamorous, what I’m basically telling them is I am available for sex. I’m on the table asa romantic or sexual interest. (Lynna, cis Asian bisexual woman, 28, middle class)Here, Lynna discussed how polyamory fits her personality traits of enjoying the freedom toexperience flexible and spontaneous attraction and stimulation outside the nesting partnership.She remembered her sense of constraint in early monogamous relationships during adolescence.Her engagement in non-monogamous relationships contributed to her realization of thecompatibility between such relationship configurations and her desire for fluidity, openness, and129ambiguity in relationship development without constraints. Similarly, Peter described the“affirming” moment, when he received friends’ support and validation of him beingpolyamorous because of his personality (i.e., flirtatious) and relationship history (i.e., hookupdating). He attributed the external affirmation to his decision to explore polyamory with hisnesting partner and build multiple relationships.Furthermore, while diversifying needs across multi-partnership was implied by allparticipants, a few also explicitly denounced the value of one partner meeting all of their needs,which led to the awareness of the compatibility of polyamory and relational values. For example,It’s very much, like I said, I have some partners who like to do some things with me andfor some partners, those aren’t their things. I’m a math nerd. I love talking aboutmathematics and stuff. I have some partners such that just terrifies them. Gives themflashbacks and stuff so I don’t talk about math with them. If I weren’t polyamorous, itwould almost be a thing where it feels like I’d have to find somebody that was an exactcopy of me to even fulfill every niche. (Cat, trans White pansexual woman, 32, lowerclass)For Cat, polyamory matched her values of relationship anarchy to experience “free association”with different partners based on shared interests, which seemed impossible to her in monogamy.Similarly, Lynna elaborated on accepting the reality that the dyad would not always connect inthe same way for varying reasons (e.g., intersecting identities, mental well-being). She valuedpolyamory as it fit her non-monogamous mindset that one partner did not have to meet all herneeds. With retrospection, these participants discussed certain levels of compatibility betweenpolyamory and their sense of self, whether it was their sexuality, personality, and/or value.Continuous Development of Intersectionality130This sub-theme was constructed based on the journeys of participants to develop variousaspects of their identities (e.g., sexuality, race, gender, disability, parent). Intersectionality wasevident in how participants described engagement with different partners, exploration of sense ofself, redefining norms, and in how participants conveyed diverse meanings of polyamory. Manyparticipants rejected or hesitated at the idea of polyamory as part of their identity for differingreasons. For example,Yeah, I’ve thought about that a lot, I’ve thought about that a lot because, on the one hand,it's part of who I am. I see it as non-negotiable part of who I am. I see it as non-negotiablein the sense that I don't see myself being successful in a monogamous relationship. I don'tthink that those structures work for me, work with my needs, work with my desires.Whenever you talk about something being like a non-negotiable, it kind of feels like youshould tie it to an identity category. But to me, it feels more like a non-negotiable the waylike I’m a lifelong vegetarian. That's not going to change just because my partner wantsto eat meat. I’m not going to compromise on that. There are certain things about myselfthat like I don't... But I don't consider myself like an innate vegetarian, like that's a part ofmy identity. I think my problem with the discourse around polyamory as an identitycategory is that I’ve very quickly seen that get co-opted and turned into peopleappropriating discourses of queer oppression into the conversation of polyamory…I havecomplicated feelings about this. I’m a little resistant to discourses of polyamory as anidentity even while I do recognize it as a non-negotiable part of the way I engage withother people. (Lynna, cis Asian bisexual woman, 28, middle class)Here, Lynna elaborated on reasons for her resistance to consider polyamory an identity, evenwith the recognition of it as a non-negotiable part of her relationship configuration. Her131perceived appropriation of queer oppression in poly identity discourse was based on straightWhite men appropriating polyamory, which historically had been part of queer relationshipstructures, for pure sexual benefits. To Lynna, identifying oneself as polyamorous could foster aself-serving mindset while ignoring relational dynamics. Similarly to Lynna, Gabe also rejectsthe idea of polyamory as a primary part of his identity.When I think of what identities I ascribe to, I don't necessarily think of poly as one of thefourth or even the fifth thing you know; I have a lot of other identities that perhaps takemore priority. It is a part of my experience and part of who I [am]. But I don't know, it's, Idon't really adhere to it in the same. But I will say I have some mixed feelings about thegreater polyculture, I think, in [city] in particular, like people who… I don't, I don'tnecessarily always enjoy talking with people who specifically ascribe themselves as polyas one of their primary identities, because it also just demonstrates a difference in valuesand how we express these identities. If polyamory is like a huge part of your identity,what about the other parts? And that doesn't really, it doesn't really show curiosity if thatmakes sense or a letter of reflection. It kind of reminds me of younger, early twentiespeople exploring themselves through identities, you know, rather than being.For Gabe, it was more important to prioritize other aspects of identity and demonstratedifferences in values and identity expressions. He later discussed his distance from the generalpolyamory culture because of his own intersectional experiences blended with gay, polyamory,and open relationship cultures, which were different from heterosexual polyamorousrelationships. To him, there was an interwoven influence of his sexuality, race, polyamory, andkink on his “breathing.” Gabe and Lynna actively reflected on their relationship with thepolyamory concept. Whereas, Puffin and Peter hesitated to identify themselves as polyamorous132because of new experiences in polyamory and not “dwelling much” on the meaning ofpolyamory. Regardless, these participants believed that polyamory was their preferredrelationship configuration.In contrast, some participants discussed that polyamory had grown into part of theiridentity over time. For example,Now that I'm thinking about it, like, maybe it is part of my identity, because if I can't goback to being monogamous. I don't know, I can't think of a situation where I would belike, “Okay, I'm gonna be monogamous now.” So maybe it has become…Like it hasn'talways been, but maybe it has become part of, part of my identity over time because Idon't think, I don't think I could go back to not being poly…I guess it has become part ofmy identity over time. I didn't, I didn't realize that until you asked me that question.That's funny. (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 46, middle class)Here, Sylvia experienced a realization during the interview that polyamory perhaps had becomepart of her identity over the years of polyamorous experiences. Although she had situationalmonogamy after entering the polyamorous journey (e.g., pregnancy, childcare), she considered ita temporary break. For her, polyamory is preferred over monogamy and other types of CNMsbecause of her value in building different connections with a fluid mindset. Similar to Sylvia,Rachel also discussed the consolidation of polyamorous identity through her exploration of andreflection on polyamorous experiences. To Elijah, it was important to acknowledge polyamory aspart of his identity because such identification provided him with a sense of power to deconstructmonogamy. Identifying herself as “polyamorous” also liberated Cat from the struggles ofconforming to monogamy and gave her strength to resist the institution of monogamy under133“capitalism” and “imperialism.” In sum, to different participants, the meaning of polyamory andits association with identity remained different.In addition, many participants discussed the development of other aspects of their identitythrough polyamorous experiences. Some particularly reflected on the deepened understanding ofdynamics between their sexuality and relationship experiences. For example,I think my pansexuality has influenced my view of polyamory itself, because I can relateto the guys who would say “How can you let somebody else be with your woman,”because I think I might have felt that way myself a while back. When I thought of apolyamorous relationship or a throuple, it was always a guy, girl, girl, you know; my girlswith somebody else, I'd be okay with that, but if my girl was a guy that I wouldn't beokay with that. So, finding the attractiveness in men more so, you know, being withmasculine women has helped me get into see myself more as a whole and not bethreatened by other men, because I see more than myself that makes me think morehighly of myself that makes me feel less threatened by somebody else, because you knowhow I might find them attractive, too. (Puffin, cis White pansexual man, upper-middleclass)Puffin remembered that his friend questioned his masculinity when disclosing his Veerelationship. Through his pansexual identity development in polyamory, he gained a deeperunderstanding of his attraction to masculinity, which increased his self-image andself-confidence. Meanwhile, this development journey also led him to deconstruct internalizedsexual double standards in polyamorous relationships, which then helped him process andaddress his jealousy due to a metamour’s gender. Similarly, Cat described that throughpolyamorous experiences, she was able to explore all relationship possibilities with people134without “the same societal and gender expectations.” For Lynna, the fulfillment of relationalpreferences by her primary partner motivated her to make intentional choices in extradyadicexperiences to seek solidarities of other aspects of her queer identity (e.g., sexuality, gender).Specifically,Now, it's like now that that part of my life is stable and secure, I feel a lot more liberatedto have these more alternative relationships with women, with non-binary people, withgender fluid people, and kind of feel that out in a way that feels safer than it did when Iwas like single and looking to settle down. (Lynna, cis Asian bisexual woman, 28, middleclass)In addition, Lynna pointed out the sense of liberation in developing relationships with people ofdifferent genders, which facilitated her growth in understanding her bisexuality and genderfluidity. Because of the difference between herself and her primary partner (e.g., race, gender,queer expression), she made intentional decisions to seek solidarities of queer identity throughextradyadic experiences with people sharing similar identities or experiences. During the“disidentification” process of “spouse identity,” she reached a high level of integration betweenpolyamory and queerness. Similar to Lynna who emphasized “queer” as their whole identity,Elijah and Cat also reflected on how polyamory had integrated as part of their queer identity, as itallowed more fluidity, ambiguity, and growth than prescribing a specific label. Furthermore, Catand Jack discussed their trans identity development in polyamory (e.g., awareness of non-binary,gender transition, coming-out) and how their gender identity influenced their relationshipexperiences. Specifically,I’m open completely, who I am and everything. I don’t want to get into a relationshipwith somebody, and then it turns out we’re just incompatible. I want to weed that out135right off the bat. If you’re incompatible with all this, whatever. That’s cool. But I’mlooking for particular people that I am compatible with. (Cat, trans White pansexualwoman, 32, lower class)Here, Cat pointed out the importance of being upfront about non-normative identities as a filterto establish compatible relationships where openness and spontaneity of feelings were allowedand accepted. She remembered living openly as trans, queer, and polyamorous “ flourished” herrelationships because she was able to “approach every relationship on their own terms.” To manyparticipants, there was a mutual reinforcement of their queer identity and polyamory.Meanwhile, participants of color discussed the relationship between their racial identityand polyamorous experiences. For example,I tried to move away from thinking about relationships like rejection and approval if thatmakes sense. It's really rather trying to find compatibility. And people who are not able torespect that part of my life, like people who don't understand my relationship with[nesting partner], even if we don't necessarily engage in sex anymore, we still love eachother. People don't understand that [nesting partner] is an important part of my life, that Ilike “No, that's not gonna work.” People who don't care about my experiences withracism, I can't, I can't do that. So if anything, both these negative experiences that I did ismicroaggression or just aggression, and also I would prefer to see that and not have tofind out later. (Gabe, cis Asian gay man, 33, middle class)Here, Gabe discussed how he determined incompatibility when experiencing aggression towardhis racial identity or relationship dynamics with his nesting partner. For him, sexuality,polyamory, and racial identity were interweaving; and together, they provided him with access toexplore his sexual preference and connection with his own ethnic community through different136lenses. For Rosa, her polyamorous experiences allowed her to deconstruct internalizedmononormativity under the religious and cultural influence of her home country. Rejectingmononormativity for its limits to fulfilling personal needs and growth, she developed a beliefthat happiness could be found in different relationships rather than in the longevity ofmonogamy. Similarly, Lynna rejected the hegemonic beliefs and values of her ethnic identity andmaintained a strong sense of ethnic identity with queerness and poly relationship even thoughthey are perceived as incompatible in her conservative ethnic community. For these participants,their polyamorous experiences and relationships facilitated the development of their own senseof racial and ethnic identity rather than following certain norms, beliefs, or values in their racialand ethnic community.Moreover, for some participants who identified themselves as neurodivergent, most oftheir relationships were developed with people who share a similar background. Specifically,Jack and Cat mentioned that almost all of their partners were neurodivergent (e.g., autism,ADHD). To them, the need for “explicit” and “honest” communication was crucial wheninteracting with partners because they could not “read minds.” For example,I’m also autistic and have ADHD. Growing up neurodivergent, I questioned a lot ofsocial structures, and authority, and stuff like that. A lot of it just never made sense to me.Finding out there’s other people like me. We can live like this, and it’s wonderful.Yesterday, I had a wonderful Valentine’s Day with a couple of my partners. We went todinner and just hung out together. Just really nice. (Cat, trans White pansexual woman,32, lower class)Cat remembered the sense of loneliness in questioning normativity and power because of herneurodivergence. Seeking and interacting with people with autism and/or ADHD gave her a137sense of togetherness. It was a significant aspect of her identity, which was disclosed upfront inrelationship engagement as a part of the compatibility assessment for potential partners. ForJack,There's definitely an aspect of emotional object permanence. I guess. And part of that Iknow, is a factor with literally all of my partners are neurodivergent in some way. And so,part of that is just, baked into the way that we are, right? And also when you don't seesomeone for a long time like people say, “Absence makes the heart grow fonder orwhatever.” But it's also like “I haven't seen you in months and months, maybe more.”And that can kind of blur a line that I feel has always been blurred for me, but I'm notsure how much of it is related to the way that I am, and how much of it is related to theexperiences that I've had, right? But kind of the blurred line between friendship andromantic relationships, where, when, like, you can be really, really close with someone.But if you haven't seen them in a long time, and you haven't been taking care to kind ofnurture that romantic aspect, right? Sometimes it feels like, “Oh, yeah, that's just mybuddy who lives far away, who I say gay things about sometimes right?” And I guessthat's something that I haven't quite untangled. What I do know is that tends to sort itselfout. I guess. (Jack, trans White pansexual man, 27, upper-middle class)Here, Jack discussed the perceived influence of shared neurodivergence with long-distancepartners on the phenomenon of emotional object permanence in maintaining long-distancerelationships. In the meantime, he acknowledged that the shared autism identity withlong-distance partners createed a mutual understanding of its impact on the communicationprocess. For both participants, their neurodivergence played an important role in their navigationof polyamorous relationships.138Lastly, some participants shared how their identity as a parent influenced theirpolyamorous experiences. In particular, Luna and Sylvia discussed their withdrawal frompolyamorous relationships during pregnancy and the maternity period because of reduced“mental capacity” or “emotional capacity” for additional relationships. For example,Yeah, I didn't have time to, you know…There's like a searching process involved indating, and I didn't, didn't have time for it, or like the emotional capacity to deal with it.So I was actually talking to somebody when I found out that I got pregnant, but, so I justput that on hold and told them I didn't, you know, “I wasn't able to proceed for rightnow.” But I'm, I'm still kind of friends with them. (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman,46, middle class)Here, Sylvia shared about withdrawing from developing extradyadic relationships to give fullmental focus on pregnancy. She discussed that this situational monogamy allowed her to focusmore energy and time on pregnancy and maternal care. At the time of the interview, she hadrecently restarted seeking polyamorous experiences. Sylvia’s experience highly resonated withLuna as she stepped out of polyamorous relationships during her pregnancy. Under this theme,participants’ experiences in polyamory may relate or differ based on their intersectionalidentities. As they were living with non-normative identities and polyamory, all participantsfaced an important task in interpersonal relationships outside of polyamory: managing the levelof outness.Managing Outness under Hetero/MononormativityThis sub-theme encompasses different levels of outness with regard to participants’sexuality and polyamory and how such levels of outness influenced their relationshipexperiences with partners, friends, colleagues, and family. For all participants, coming out is an139ongoing process, during which most of them need to conduct “internal processing” or “mathprocessing” (i.e., intentional calculations about safety and needs) to determine whether theywould disclose their sexuality and/or polyamory. In addition, it seemed unanimous thatparticipants perceived coming out about their sexuality (e.g., gay, bisexual, pansexual,demisexual) as easier than coming out about polyamory. For example,I think polyamory is a lot more challenging to come out. Sexual orientation has definitelybecome more normalized in America right now to where I don't feel as much of a stigmasaying that I have a preference of men or preference of women, whichever I happen to befeeling at the time, because there are so many other people out there who feel the sameway and [inaudible] lives. And there's so many protests and everything going against a lotof the very biblical beliefs around the country; maybe that's the wrong term, maybefar-right biblical beliefs, because I don't mean religion as a whole as a bad thing, it’s justthe way people tend to take it to an extreme. (Puffin, cis White pansexual man,upper-middle class)Here, Puffin credited the community effort in normalizing sexual orientations in the U.S. to thede-stigmatization of pansexuality, which makes coming out as pansexual easier than polyamory.His outing process as pansexual was characterized by authentic being, subtleness, and activism(e.g., putting a gay sticker on his car, vocalizing support for LGBTQ+, disclosing sexuality whenasked). Similarly, many other participants discussed the normalization of sexual orientation inthe U.S. facilitated a reduced worry or concern about disclosing their sexuality. For example,Amy teased about the ease of coming out as bisexual because “these days everyone knows a gayperson.” Elijah also discussed coming out as demisexual with same-sex attraction was not aschallenging as coming out as polyamorous because “ I can explain a little, then we move on.” It is140also worth noting that the level of outness about sexual orientation depended on the residingstates of the participants. For example, Puffin used “hostile” to describe people’s attitudes towardnon-heterosexuality in his state. Similarly, Peter also pointed out the perceived threat to personalsafety as a gay man in his state. Specifically,[Patner] who's never explored with a man before, to him, holding a guy's hand on mainstreet is awesome. Like he's like “This is cool. I never thought I get to do this before.”And I'm looking around A- for like do people know me, and they know [metamour], likethey're gonna see me holding hands with the person they know as her fiancé, and B- justlike in general, I'm in [state], thinking there is a chance that someone's gonna attack me.So Tim, who's not, had to grow up with that concern, It's different for him to like, it's easyfor him to be, “Yeah, this is cool.” So that's been an unforeseen dialogue between him andI is what that looks like in public. (Peter, cis White gay man, 29, upper-middle class)For Peter, there was a need to discuss with his partner about public display of affection becauseof differing perceptions of its consequences. Regardless, all participants, in general, had higherlevels of comfort in coming out of their sexual orientation, even though some had experiencedcertain negative experiences in the past.As for participants who identified as transgender, both pointed out the challenges in theircoming out process. For example,It was really just them [parents], honestly. I was worried that they were going to disownme. They didn’t really take me being trans super well. They actually warmed up to it. Ithink honestly, seeing me really happy. Me and my partners went down to visit thembecause they live an hour south of where I live now. Them seeing me and my partnersjust really happy together, I think that really were like, “Wow, I’ve never actually seen141them that happy in their life before. Maybe they’re onto something.” I think that reallyenlightened them, honestly. (Cat, trans White pansexual woman, 32, lower class)Cat reflected on overcoming fears to disclose her trans identity to her parents, which contributedto a sense of freedom to live authentically in public. For Cat, the perceived fear was attributed toyears of indirect “sexual repression and sexual abuse” through “the Catholic Church” duringchildhood. While Cat’s disclosure of her trans identity to her parents was an active decision,Jack’s trans identity was accidentally outed by one of his siblings. Jack shared how this outing“fueled that decision” to disclose his gender identity to his immediate and extended familybecause “when I come out to them it won't be like it's a huge, fucking surprise.” In addition, Jackcontinued to navigate his trans outness at work and in public based on perceived safety andacceptance.With regard to the level of polyamory outness, all participants had kept polyamorousrelationships secretive in some aspects of their lives due to perceived mononormativity. There isa commonality that disclosure of polyamory among close friend circles has been relatively easyby comparison with family, professional, and general social settings. For example,My close friends know, a couple of my close friends. They, what's really cool is, it's, theyshare their stuff with me, you know their intimate stuff. We can talk about it withoutshame or fear of being judged. (Elijah, cis biracial gay man, 36, upper-middle class)Here, Elijah pointed out that closeness with friends facilitated disclosing polyamory to thembecause of no perceived fear of facing judgment. For many other participants, the openness andacceptance of close friends toward their non-normative identities reduced their fear of sharingtheir polyamorous relationships and experiences. However, disclosure of polyamory to family142seemed to be more complicated for most participants. Some participants chose to maintain theirpolyamorous relationship in the closet. For example,I mean, my parents are certainly not aware that I’m polyamorous…I do have this fear of,like oh my gosh what if it got back to my parents somehow? What if the wrong personheard about it or saw me on Hinge? There is kind of this constant fear that I’m going tobe found out and have to explain myself to my parents, which is a very fraught and toxicrelationship that we don't really need to get into. But the stakes of that are very high forme and we can maybe just leave it there. The stakes of my parents finding out are quitehigh. It's something I would really like to avoid if I can help it. (Lynna, cis Asian bisexualwoman, 28, middle class)Here, Lynna described her persisting fear of being accidentally outed to her parents, which wouldworsen the already complicated relationship with them. For Lynna, the decision to not disclosepolyamory to her parents was based on perceived negative attitudes towards polyamory due tocultural and religious conservativism and disinterest in sharing relationship experiences due to afraught parent-child relationship. Similarly, Amy chose not to share her polyamory with herparents because of perceived mononormativity based on lived experiences in heteronormativityagainst her bisexuality. Specifically,My parents still can't fully deal with the bisexuality thing. So if they, if they can't get theirheads around that, the polyamory things absolutely going to, they're gonna see it as somemoral issue, I feel. (Amy, cis White bisexual woman, 25, lower-middle class)In addition, Dominic had not come out as polyamorous to his family because “I have a very, verydistant, don't really have a relationship with my mom, dad, sister, that's my family.” For these143participants, complicated relationships with parents and perceived negativity of parents towardpolyamory contributed to the concealment of polyamorous relationships.In contrast, many participants discussed their slow process of disclosing theirpolyamorous relationships to their families. For example,I had to tell her that we were doing this, and she got all these kinds of ideas from it, thatyou know it was his idea; that we weren't serious about each other, and you know, like allof these other things that happen, because I told her that we had an open relationship.And you know she's got an idea in her head of what that means, which is not the same,you know, idea that we had about each other. So, and it took like a couple of months forme to like get to all the things that she was coming up with that she thought this meant‘cause it didn't mean we weren't serious about each other, (pause) and it wasn't his idea. Itold her; I said, “I was doing this before I met him, so this wasn't even his idea like heeven knew this had existed before I met him.” (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman,46, middle class)Sylvia pointed out her experiences of mononormativity when disclosing polyamory to hermother. Eventually, with a long process of educating on polyamorous relationships andexperiences, Sylvia reduced her mother’s negative perceptions of polyamory. Afterward, thespecialness of a metamour motivated her to disclose polyamorous relationships to individualfamily members at different stages. In fact, it was common that participants had faced negativereactions from parents initially, which later shifted to more tolerant or accepting responses. Forexample, Luna remembered that her father was “flipped off” when she disclosed her polyamory.His change of attitude toward polyamory to tolerance was due to witnessing the merits of herpolyamorous relationships and intention to maintain involvement in grandchildren’s lives.144Rarely, few participants shared the privilege of having parental acceptance of their polyamorousrelationships. For example,When I came out to her [mother] it was a matter of “So just you know, this is what'shappening, this is what it is, this is how things are going, this is why.” And I think therewas some empathy there because I told her that Gabe had stepped out; she'd had thatexperience as well with my dad. But she also has always, despite us being very differentpeople, has always been very open to hearing what my life experiences are becausethey're so different than hers. And as a result, she was like, “Is there a website or somekind of material you could tell me to read up on this more when we're not talking?” And Ilet her borrow a copy, my copy of More Than Two, the book More Than Two, the bookThe Ethical Slut, and the book Polysecure, the book Unfuck Your Boundaries. And I'vegiven them to her, and she kind of educated herself and is kind of catching up so that sheunderstands where everything is. (Rachel, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 39,working-middle class)For Rachel, the physical and emotional closeness with her mother facilitated the decision todisclose her polyamorous relationship. She also anticipated empathy from her mother for herrelationship experiences based on shared adversity in their partners’ infidelity (i.e., both Racheland her mother had experiences of husband engaging in infidelity during monogamy). Rachel’sdisclosure of polyamory facilitated her mother’s willingness to educate herself on polyamorydespite her hetero/mononormative background. Similarly, Peter and Cat also identified theirprivilege of having accepting parents compared to most of their partners and metamours.Specifically,145I don't really have any of the barriers with that. I mean, my parents don't really get it, butthey're, they're like, “I don't get it, but sure tell me how many plates to have at the dinnertable.” So they're, they're generally supportive. (Peter, cis White gay man, 29,upper-middle class)Peter discussed that the lack of understanding of the polyamory concept was not a barrier forparents to demonstrate support. While many participants might not have supportive parents likePeter and Rachel, a few shared their disclosure of polyamory to family members in their samegeneration even though they had not come out to their parents. For example,I actually came out to them [cousins]. I told them, “Hey, listen!” I took them to dinner, Iasked if this was a good time for them to talk, and that's when I told them that “Jake andI, we are polyamorous. If you see us with somebody else outside, it's, you know, we haveconsent. This is what we're doing. We’re not separating. And also, I want to explore otherthings. I might be dating a woman; I might not. And you just don't know. So I'mexploring myself right now, and that's something that we both have agreed that we'regoing to try to be supportive.” They listened. We did that, I'm gonna say, right before thepandemic, and they know, they know about me. They know that I've had girlfriends. Theyknow that we have dated other people. (Rosa, cis Latinx bisexual woman, 42, middleclass)For Rosa, the decision to disclose her polyamorous relationship to her cousins was driven by thesense of security and safety of having a support system (e.g., “husband,” “poly community”).Here, she discussed the intention of disclosing polyamory was to address the potential confusionof her cousins about her polyamorous experiences in public. Later, she also received supportfrom her sister for her polyamorous relationships yet kept them secretive from older generations.146Similarly, Jack also disclosed his polyamorous relationship to one of his siblings based onperceived acceptance. To both participants, a perceived higher level of acceptance of polyamoryin younger generations led to their decision to come out.In contrast to the complicated coming out process to family, managing poly outness inprofessional and general social settings seemed straightforward: non- or minimum disclosure ofpolyamory. For most participants, such a decision helped avoid potential negative attitudes orconsequences because of their polyamorous relationship. For example,I worked in a very conservative field. I was working in construction with a bunch ofmale engineers. Like I didn't, I didn't tell them that I was bisexual, I didn't tell them I waspolyamorous, because I feel like it takes away from the job that I'm doing, you know. It'smore focused on than you know the actual work that I'm doing. So I just never told.(Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 46, middle class)Here, Sylvia reflected on the reason for the concealment of polyamory and her bisexuality atwork. She chose concealment to avoid perceived negative impacts of hetero/mononormativitywhen she worked in a male-dominant conservative profession. Later, she discussed a perceivedincrease in comfort for disclosing polyamory in the future because of varying factors: leaving ahetero/mononormative work environment, less concern about people’s perception because ofaging, and confidence in herself and relationships. The majority of participants sided with Sylviato conceal their polyamorous relationship in their professional life. More importantly, a few ofthem made such a decision to avoid complaints or punishment. For example,I'm not gonna tell them [students], because some parent is going to end up calling thefront office in a tizzy for promoting polygamy, you know. They all know that their kidsare in the queerest classroom in school. It just, and that seems to be a trend, where it's like147people who will be unashamedly out about certain elements of their queer identity willkeep that part very quiet. That's where it's going to be treated as inappropriate asinherently sexual in a way that people used to treat queer identities. I think people arevery strongly associated with a purely sexual experience, and therefore inappropriate forchildren inherently, instead of just like being like any other relationship, just different.(Amy, cis White bisexual woman, 25, lower-middle class)Amy decided to conceal her polyamorous relationship to avoid dealing with the negativeconsequences of mononormativity in school culture. While she felt comfortable disclosing herbisexual identity in the classroom, she perceived polyamory would be considered too radical tobe accepted by the adults. Similarly, Puffin was “absolutely secretive about my polyamorousrelationships” at work to avoid the negative consequences of mononormative culture and policy(e.g., violation of policy if married, unemployment). His inability to share his experiences andfeelings about his relationships with co-workers contributed to a sense of shame (i.e., “it made itfeel like it was almost a dirty thing”) for disguising his polyamorous partner (i.e., “It was alwaysjust a friend”). For these participants, perceived negative attitudes and consequences based onmononormativity led to concealment of polyamorous relationships at work.Meanwhile, some participants discussed how the closeness with certain colleaguesfacilitated their decision to disclose their polyamorous relationships. For many, there was a senseof trust in their colleagues to keep their polyamorous relationship in confidence. In particular,I'm definitely more of an open person. And also like I'm you know, “out” at work, I'mfriends with my coworkers. I'm the only one that's friends with every single person in thedepartment. So, it's easy for me to be open with them; some of them, not everyone knowsthat I'm dating [metamour] fiancée, just because we all do work together. But it's kind of148an inside joke between [metamour] and I, you know. We’ll hang out socially as “friends.”But some coworkers do know. (Peter, cis White gay man, 29, upper-middle class)Here, Peter pointed out that closeness with colleagues influenced the extent of polyamoryoutness at work. He later discussed that he deferred perceived closeness with people to determinehis comfort level of disclosing polyamorous relationships. Similar to Puffin’s experiences, Peterdisguised his partners as “friends” before colleagues who were unaware of his polyamorousrelationships. Likewise for Rachel,My bosses know. I'm in a, I'm in a very unique system situation where my bosses are alsomy friends. We used to work at a different place together, and our boss at our previousjob was polyamorous openly and knew all his partners. One of his partners actually endedup being his business partner at one point. So they were already exposed to it via him.When [nesting partner] and I opened up, I, one of my bosses was one of my best friends;she was one of my bridesmaids. So I'm again in a kind of unique situation where comingout was easy. It was easy. I didn't, that wasn't a challenge at all, not at all. (Rachel, cisWhite bi/pansexual woman, 39, working-middle class)The “unique system” where colleagues were open-minded about polyamory because of differentkinds of exposure eliminated Rachel’s challenge in disclosing her relationships at work. Amyonly disclosed her polyamorous relationship to two colleagues because of shared backgrounds(i.e., “polyamorous,” “bisexual,” “have ADHD”). To Peter, Rachel, and Amy, being “friends”with colleagues was an important facilitator in disclosing their polyamorous relationships.Parallel to minimizing the level of polyamory outness at work, all participants discussedhow they managed to maintain the secrecy of their polyamorous relationship in most social andcommunity settings. For example,149I kind of don't want my neighbors to know, because they could be totally cool with it orthey could be super religious in a way that makes them kind of nasty to us, or whateverthe reason may be. And if they are, they're my neighbor, and I have to live with that rightnext door, and that would make me very uncomfortable. I am sensitive to mysurroundings, and I want to feel safe, even though I know that like “Who really cares orwhatever.” I would feel that negative energy, and I don't want to feel that. So I guess it'sjust, and this has been tricky, like I don't even totally have the answer to your question,because it's something that's been hard for me to figure out. Like what am I scared of,exactly? And I'm not totally sure. (Glenn, cis White pansexual woman, 43, middle class)Here, Glenn discussed her intention to maintain her polyamorous relationship secretive in herneighborhood because of her proximity to neighbors and uncertainty about their attitudes towardpolyamory. For her, disclosing polyamory to an unaccepting neighbor might lead to constantlyliving with a sense of unsafety and negativity. Later, she reflected that knowing people’s politicaland religious philosophies (i.e., “liberal,” “not right-wing religious” “appreciates diversity”) wasimportant to determine her level of safety in disclosing polyamory. Likewise, Luna chose not toactively disclose her polyamorous relationships to neighbors to avoid potential misinterpretationof her behaviors as promiscuous (i.e., “hitting on them”). In addition, for many participants,concealing polyamorous relationships in public was to avoid mononormative negativity. Forexample,The [ethnic] community is a place where I’m very hesitant just because people talk andmy parents know everybody. It's just a... It's very specific... It would be complicated forthat community. Even with people who I do think would probably be on board or wouldunderstand, there's this hesitation of, okay, but what's the trail? How is this going to get150back to my parents with this person? I’m also, I’m a professional flutist in the [ethnic]community. So, I’m in a lot of more traditional conservative spaces. Obviously, that's notgoing to come up in those spaces. (Lynna, cis Asian bisexual woman, 28, middle class)Lynna had kept her polyamorous relationship secretive in her own ethnic community due toperceived cultural conservativism and mononormative values. For her, even if polyamory couldbe accepted by certain individuals, there was also a risk of being accidentally outed to parents.Similarly,[Husband] and [primary partner] and I would show up together at events, and just kind ofnot say anything, and let people wonder what the hell was going on. (Luna, cis Whitepansexual woman, 46, upper-middle class)Luna remembered how she had managed the public presentation of their polyamorousrelationship in her previous Vee relationship. The outside confusion of her relationship statusbrought enjoyment and amusement to fulfill her “ mischievous” spirit. In sum, the level ofpolyamory outness in general social settings was determined by the sense of safety and comfortin a particular place, time, and relationship.For most participants, they perceived coming out as a personal decision unless it wouldaffect their partners. Many participants who had nesting or primary partners discussed thecoming out process with them to determine the extent of polyamory outness. For example,We take our dog around the neighborhood, and we just walk. And that's like our therapytime when we talk to each other as a couple without our phones and stuff. And I told himI said, “You know, I really want to talk about what we've been doing.” And he goes, “Oh,we have been talking about.” I said, “Oh, yes, you and I have been awesome, and we'retalking about that. I need to tell somebody else.” Part of it is because I don't want it to be151a secret, because secrets, people keep secrets about things are ashamed of. That was mybelief. That I told him that. He kind of got that. I said, “I'm not gonna tell everybody, I’mnot gonna write it on a big sign and put it in our front yard or anything. But there areimportant relationships in my life, of people I need to talk this through with because thereare certain things that I just need to talk about that and get perspectives on. And he goes,“Okay, who?” And then I kind of told him who I was thinking, and he was like “All right,yeah, absolutely.” (Elijah, cis biracial gay man, 36, upper-middle class)Here, Elijah discussed how his dyad had communicated to make decisions on coming out aspolyamorous to certain people in his life. For him, coming out was to confront the perceivedshame of polyamorous relationships. Similarly, Lynna and Puffin also reflected on thecommunication process with their partners with regard to whom, when, and how to come out.As polyamory is a multi-partnership, many participants also discussed how the relationalcomponent of polyamory outness sometimes influenced their relationship experiences withpartners. For example, similar to Peter and Puffin, many other participants labeled their partnersas “friends” or “neighbors.” While some partners offered understanding and empathy to theconcealment of polyamorous relationships, a few participants discussed the negative impacts ofsuch concealment on their relationships. For example,Some people that I have dated, they did in the poly community for so long that they'reopen, they're fine with it, and they get slightly uncomfortable because I do have to shyaway from something. And that's been difficult because some people don't want that.They don't wanna be the second person, they wanna be a primary, and it (pause) makes itdifficult. It does, at times. But some of them are okay to go through a transition, and evensome of them have met my family. Sadly, some of them have met them as friends, and152two of them have met them as friends, and they weren’t my friends, and they… It, it putsus in a difficult position. It kind of causes a little bit of resentment without intentionallywanting to, because then they see my husband as a primary, and that's why they assumethat there is some sort of hierarchy and it makes us so uncomfortable. (Rosa, cis Latinxbisexual woman, 42, middle class)Here, Rosa pointed out the non-disclosure of polyamorous partners in family settingscontributing to the resentment of some partners due to a perceived hierarchy. For Rosa, varyingpolyamorous experiences and cultural values (collectivism vs. individualism) influenced thecomfort level of polyamory outness that had strained some of her polyamorous relationships.Similarly, Luna briefed on her challenges in managing the outness of polyamorous relationshipsbecause of individual differences among partners. As for Amy,But I make that clear to my partners, and it's like, you know, hopefully, by making thatclear, they don't feel like I'm trying to hide them from people who are important in mylife that I'm ashamed of them, ‘cause I don't want them to think I'm ashamed of them. I’mnot. My friends know about them. I'm happy to introduce them to my friends. (Amy, cisWhite bisexual woman, 25, lower-middle class)By explaining to her partners her rationale for concealing polyamory from her parents, Amy triedto reassure her partners of their importance to her and her life even though she chose not tointroduce them to her family. Amy believed her polyamorous relationships were not her parents’“business,” and she considered her friends more trustworthy and important to introduce herpolyamorous partners to. In contrast, Rachel discussed her mixed feelings about defaulting to herpartner and metamour with regard to polyamorous outness.153So, whatever her comfort level and her boundaries, as far as that goes, as far as being outwith [one partner], I have made the choice to default to whatever [metamour] needs, tosay as much as it sucks to let somebody else dictate your actions, if I have those specificboundaries, I would want those boundaries to be respected as well. So when it comes tobeing out with [one partner], I default to Misha’s boundaries and comfort levels. (Rachel,cis White bi/pansexual woman, 39, working-middle class)For Rachel, her level of public outness with a specific partner depended on the boundaries andcomfort level of her metamour. Her mixed feeling about managing polyamorous outness with herpartner came from losing control of personal coming-out decisions and compromising to respectmetamour’s boundaries. Later, she discussed how she was able to enjoy a higher level ofpolyamory outness with another partner in the family and public due to his openness aboutpolyamorous relationships.Furthermore, Glenn reflected on how her own lower level of polyamory outness hadinfluenced the triad on navigating social life together. Specifically,The effect that it has is that everybody already knows my husband and I are marriedright? That’s been a very visible thing since he and I got together. And so it doesn'tnecessarily feel very good for my wife in the arenas where I'm not out, because itbasically is like she's invisible, and I don't like that at all. (Glenn, cis White pansexualwoman, 43, middle class)Here, Glenn pointed out that her low level of polyamory outness contributed to a sense ofinvisibility in public for her wife who did not have a legal status. Again, because of theunrecognition of polyamorous marriage and low public acceptance of polyamorous relationships,154Glenn’s triad experienced stress over making decisions on “how we can operate in the world, orthe places we want to go.”As aforementioned, most participants considered coming out as polyamorous as arelational decision that needed to be made with certain partners. In addition, different levels ofpolyamory outness among partners influenced their relationship experiences. As participantsnavigate their polyamorous relationship in a hetero/mononormative society, they face varioussocietal challenges that permeate their personal and relational lives.GET Four: Interwoven Personal, Relational, and Systemic ChallengesThis GET include three sub-themes that describe various levels of challenges participantsexperience while maintaining their relationships. Some of the challenges were inherent due to theadded complexity of a multi-partnered relationship; for most participants, however, the primarychallenges come from a societal level that influences their personal and relational well-being.Overall, internalization of these experiences of challenge influenced psychological andrelationship distress and resilience.Prevalence of Hegemony in a Normative SocietyParticipants described various types of normativity in their lived experiences (acrossvarious social systems from school, work, home, and when accessing mental health support) withtheir intersectional identities (e.g., sexuality, gender, disability) and polyamorous relationships.For most participants, the additive stressors were rooted in the mononormativity against theirpolyamorous relationships. For example,Even as far as the HOA, right? So there’re 6 units in my building. The rules say, howmany keys you are allowed, right? So like well, it was like a whole thing to get[metamour] a key, so now we only have one key for our guests, because it was like, what155if you have children? So wait, I could have like 10 children and get 10 extra keys, butbecause I've got like one boyfriend, it’s a big deal. (Dominic, cis White gay man, 37,upper class)Here, Dominic pointed out the mononormativism that contributed to his experience of injusticewith the homeowners association. Later, he further elaborated on challenges in dealing withanother social system (i.e., hospital) due to the systemic unrecognition of polyamorousrelationships. Dominic’s experience was not an exception. Particularly,If we were allowed to get legally married, we would…That can be a source of difficultybecause that doesn't always feel great for her. That he and I not only have the history, butalso the legal marriage, and also practical things like health insurance and…Uhm, owningproperty, we were able to do. We own our home together like we're all on the deed. Yeah.It does come up. It was important to us to have the wedding, you know, even though itwasn't legal, with our community and have that ceremony. But there is kind of a trickyspot sometimes that we can't all be legally married. (Glenn, cis White pansexual woman,43, middle class)There were systemic challenges that Glenn’s triad had experienced due to the unrecognition ofpolyamorous relationships. Such discrimination then complicated their relationship. For Glenn, atriad effort to flatten the perceived hierarchy by centering equality, commitment, togetherness,and belongingness was important because of her long relationship and legal marriage status withher husband compared to her wife. Similarly, Jack also attributed the mononormativism in theU.S. healthcare system to the perceived dilemma in selecting her partners and child for insurancecoverage. He also discussed how the perceived level of inclusion in different states to polyamory156along with non-heterosexuality and transgender identity would limit relocation options. Such adilemma resonated with Peter. For example,So as far as politically or whatever, part of the concern just in general for being LGBTlike, what states can I live in and not get, you know, kicked out of housing or fired frommy job? And I'm already in [state]. And I don't want to go further south. But there's apretty nice job opportunity, [state], which is even worse. So if that would be harder evenwith not just being gay, but having multiple boyfriends, just hard for people to acceptpotentially… But now it's, “Okay, is this where we want to be long-term? Do we want tobe in a society or an area that is more accepting of not just LGBT relationships butpolyamory in general, surrounded by friends or isolated in a Southern State? (Peter, cisWhite gay man, 29, upper-middle class)Perceived levels of inclusiveness for sexual orientation and polyamory in different statescomplicated Peter’s decision-making for housing, employment, and state of residence, whichcontributed to the experience of extra stress.In addition, several participants discussed the influence of religion on negative attitudestoward their sexuality and polyamory. For example,We once got into a fight because I was wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow stripe on it andwe were going to pick up my wedding dress. My mom was like, \"For me, a wedding is areligious thing. I’m going to pray the Ganesh before we get your dress. I don't need youdressing this way in that context.\" It was this kind of this idea that Hinduism andqueerness were these incompatible categories. I would say my parents would probablyfeel that way, that something about being poly is incompatible with Indian ideologies orHindu ideologies or whatever. (Lynna, cis Asian bisexual woman, 28, middle class)157Here, Lynna experienced criticism from her mother who perceived Lynna’s queerness as a threatto her ethnic identity. Such criticism led Lynna to develop a perceived rejection of polyamoryfrom her parents. Similarly, several other participants also discussed how their parents’ religiousbeliefs contributed to negative attitudes toward their sexuality, which eventually led them toconceal their polyamorous relationships. Specifically, as quoted earlier, Amy’s past experiencesof encountering heteronormativity against bisexuality led to the perceived parental rejection ofpolyamory. Glenn, Puffin, and Cat also discussed the negative influences of religious extremismon the public attitude toward sexuality, gender, and polyamory. Similarly, Elijah and Rosa alsodiscussed their decision to conceal their polyamorous relationships was based on unreadiness tounpack their hetero/mononormativism rooted in Christianity (i.e., Mormonism, Catholicism).While mental health care is supposed to support and help clients in challenging times,many participants shared their unpleasant experiences of mononormativity in their interactionswith mental health providers. For example,I've had, I had a counselor that they told me that I need to leave my marriage so that I canexplore myself. I had that advice that maybe I just need to be on my own, so I can figuremyself out. And I disagree with that. That's not what I wanna do. (Rosa, cis Latinxbisexual woman, 42, middle class)Here, Rosa remembered experiencing an explicit anti-poly bias from her previous counselorswho had hetero/mononormative philosophies. She reflected on her counselor being confused byher polyamorous relationship. Later, Rosa acknowledged the benefits of finding a supportive andaffirming counselor, yet she faced another barrier to receiving mental health services: costs.Similar to Amy, the benefits of mental health care came with a financial cost that she was unableto afford. Meanwhile, Lynna elaborated that even though the therapist never “explicitly158denounced it,” she perceived an implicit anti-CNM bias from her current therapist (i.e.,“conflated the open relationship part of it with the other problems in the relationship”). Inaddition, Peter perceived the incompetency of his current relationship counselor due to hisexhibition of microaggression toward his sexuality (i.e., “homosexual acts”).Some participants in the mental health field also recognized the perpetuation ofmononormativity in the counseling curriculum and research. For example,I don't want to take you back to CACREP, But I'm doing Intro to Family Counseling.And, my goodness, you know I feel like I should invoice my professor for my therapyco-pays because tell you the textbook I had from 2011 written by professors in Chicago,I'm like “I wanna, I'm gonna write them an angry letter.” As you know that the“alternative families.” Oh my god, all that… and why is it that gay people have lifestylesbut straight people have lives, right? But our idea of what home institutes a family, we'restill in America, wedded to the nuclear family myth, which we've known has been a mythfor 50 years, but I haven't got 50 years to wait for us to realize that like the nontraditionalfamily is actually the norm. (Dominic, cis White gay man, 37, upper class)Here, Dominic pointed out his frustration over the microaggressions toward his sexuality andrelationship configuration in counseling course materials. He reflected on the constant emotionalstress (i.e., “fish out of water”) from stepping out of his queer bubble to experiencinghetero/mononormativity in CACREP-accredited counseling training. Later, he continued todiscuss his perception of the mental health field perpetuating the unfair institution of marriagethrough biased research. Similarly,I'm not convinced that even your traditional couples are reproducing the developmentalmodels because of social desirability and under-reporting in research. I'm, you know, for159instance, it's even in the name couples counseling. Couples, that's exclusionary of polypractitioners. So I've really been pushing for like intimate counseling, and intimaterelationship counseling, or some kind of way to frame it that says we're not just interestedin the couple. We, it's so embedded in our culture, it's in our language. We don't havewords to describe it. (Elijah, cis biracial gay man, 36, upper-middle class)For Elijah, some of the findings to support the traditional relationship developmental modelsmight not be as empirical as they had appeared to be. The mononormative language in thecounseling field also contributed to a sense of perceived exclusion of polyamory. JoiningDominic, Elijah also intended to advocate for inclusion and justice for polyamory in thecounseling profession.With a high prevalence of mononormativity in society, many participants experiencedchallenges due to a lack of research and discourse on polyamorous relationships. For example,Because often like the culture that you're up against as a polyamorist, is that, well, likewho is your partner, right? And we've been together, if I've been with my boyfriend for 6months, but I've been with [nesting partner] for 13 years, generally, the duration is themarker of success. And one of the biggest lessons that [nesting partner] and I had to learnis, how do you know your relationship is healthy if you've already done all the things ona checklist that most people think is a healthy relationship, right? I already own a house,right? We don't want kids. I've got married already. I'm not doing all that again. So whatdoes it look like with my other partners? (Dominic, cis White gay man, 37, upper class)Here, Dominic pointed out the dearth of models to assess the health of polyamorousrelationships. He continued to discuss the lack of social discourse on the healing of attachmentwounds perpetuating senses of isolation and insecurity that could hinder relationship160development. In addition, he experienced a lack of resources assisting him in navigating thecomplexity of polyamorous relationship dissolution. Elijah also echoed that the scholarlyignorance of polyamorous populations contributed to a sense of uncertainty in his lifespandevelopment. In addition, Rosa and Elijah discussed the limitation of the current language todescribe their polyamorous feelings and partners. Amy also attributed the lack of visibility andnormalization of polyamory in society to the perpetuation of anti-polyamory biases thatchallenged her living and outing as polyamorous. In sum, these participants explicitly discussedtheir perceived or lived challenges in a mononormative society. It is also crucial to point outagain, all participants either implied or stated their decision to conceal their polyamorousrelationship was based on low acceptance of polyamory in the U.S.In addition, some participants also discussed their experiences of micro/macroaggressionin their interpersonal relationships. For example,And it's really funny, too, because I think, like some of my friends who have cheated likebefore, when I tell them that I'm doing this, they get offended, and I'm like, “But you..”you know, “You cheated on somebody.” I'm not doing that, like everybody knows aboutit. So it's different than what you did. I think that mindset, like you were saying, like theheteronormative relationship mindset, is so ingrained in our society that people struggleto understand how that works. (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 46, middle class)For Sylvia, the anticipated receptiveness of friends to polyamory failed to match her experiencesin reality. Friends who had engaged in infidelity exhibited negative attitudes toward herpolyamorous relationship which contributed to her sense of confusion. Sylvia believed that theinternalization of hetero/mononormativity had contributed to her friends’ biases againstpolyamory. Similarly, Luna also encountered implicit biases against polyamory from her friends161who were “curious” if polyamory caused the relationship dissolution with her now-separatedhusband. In addition,I feel like any challenge, they’re going to be like, “Oh, it's because you're polyamorous.”And I will be like, “Well, don’t you have communication issues with your monogamouspartner?” So, some of it is that I don't want to set a precedent when it's in this negativestate, it's going to influence the people, even though I feel safe telling them aboutpolyamory, I don't tell them all the details, because I don't want them to be predisposed tobe like “you shouldn't do that.” (Peter, cis White gay man, 29, upper-middle class)Peter perceived biases from friends toward polyamory (i.e., judgment, blaming polyamory forrelationship challenges), contributing to his lower comfort level of sharing polyamorousrelationship experiences with certain friends. Many participants share the same “concern” and“stress” about seeking support from their monogamous friends because they might blamepolyamory as the cause of their relationship problems. For these participants, the need to justifytheir polyamorous relationships was “exhausting.” In addition to Peter, Amy, and Elijah alsodiscussed their emotional exhaustion from “justifying” their polyamorous relationships.I mean the poly thing is so, it's, it's such a loaded, I mean, there's so much explanationyou have to do that you almost feel like you're trying to justify it to the person you'recoming out to… If I say, “I’m a demisexual person who engages in polyamorousrelationships,” that derails the whole purpose, you know what I mean. And you have todo so much explanation, and it's exhausting. (Elijah, cis biracial gay man, 36,upper-middle class)Amy and Elijah both perceived exhaustion from justifying their polyamorous relationships inhypothetical scenarios. For them, the institutionalization and prevalence of mononormativity162contributed to the internalization of mononormativity that challenges people to understand theirpolyamorous relationship. It is worth noting that a few participants (i.e., Sylvia, Amy, Elijah)perceived the institutionalization of polygamy also contributed to outsider misperceptions ofpolyamory that led to anti-polyamory biases and stigma.In addition, the LGBTQIA+ community is not an exception to anti-poly biases andstigmas. Some participants discussed how mononormativity prevailed in the community. Forexample,Usually, we have a one-on-one shortly after [the pride event], we tell people we're gonnado that If they wanna come listen. And I had this person walk up, and I started to explainit, and they said, “I don't, I don't wanna be recruited,” or something, and then like walkedaway so fast, they were walking to the next sign from the next booth, and I was like, “Idon't understand where this perception comes from that we're trying to recruitpeople.”...We wanted to tell people that it existed, but nobody's trying to recruit peopleinto it. If you don't want to be there, nobody wants to date somebody who doesn't wannabe polyamorous. (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 46, middle class)Sylvia remembered an encounter with anti-poly bias while she helped her poly group to promotepoly visibility in the LGBTQIA+ community. Such a bias contributed to the development ofconfusion because it contradicted her perceived diversity and inclusion within the LGBTQIA+community. Similarly, Gabe and Dominic also discussed encounters of mononormativity ondating apps where people accused them of “stealing” “good candidates.” Particularly,I remember one interaction where someone on Scruff accused me of stealing all thesingle men. And I, and I said, “Okay, let me give you a math lesson, darling. We're two163married guys who are poly. We are literally adding to the pool, the entropy of availablemen.” (Dominic, cis White gay man, 37, upper class)Dominic discussed how prominent homonormativity that marginalized the intersectionality ofgayness and polyamory contributed to the anti-poly stigma in the gay community. Adding to hisencounter with poly negativity from another user in the dating app, he elaborated on theexistence of mononormativity in the design of the current gay dating apps (i.e., Scruff).Similarly, Gabe faced various microaggressions on dating apps, such as “Oh, you'repolyamorous,” “You're just taking away people who are good dates,” “Why can you just behappy with the one person that you have,” or “You’re just greedy.” Eventually, Gabe rationalizedthese microaggressions were people’s projection of their own “sense of scarcity and insecurity inthemselves.”Furthermore, biases and misconceptions existed in many participants’ polyamorous orCNM worlds because of their sexuality, gender, and relationship structure. For instance,I definitely have a self-consciousness of having like a straight presenting male husbandespecially when I reach out to women on the apps because a lot of them will assumewe're just looking for a unicorn, looking for a threesome like looking for whatever. Hispicture is on my profile, and that's by our agreement. People need to be told upfront thathe exists and that he's part of the conversation and stuff. But I definitely, like I see certainwomen's profiles where they're like — not interested in meeting your boyfriend and kindof like this whole... So, I definitely also have that experience of feeling like certain queerwomen will take me less seriously because I’m married to a man. (Lynna, cis Asianbisexual woman, 28, middle class)164Here, Lynna perceived bias from other queer women due to their misconceptions about hermarriage and her primary partner’s involvement in polyamorous experiences. Later, shediscussed her witnessing biases and dismissiveness from her CNM friends toward relationalchallenges in non-primary partnerships because they were considered “casual” or “lessimportant.” In a similar way, Sylvia also discusses internalized hetero/normativity of herpolyamorous friends contributed to their misinterpretation of her relationship configurations asmonogamous. In addition,I think a lot of people join, being like, “Oh, then I can sleep with whomever I want.” Andthat's like it's not really the way that it works. On some levels of ethical non-monogamy,it does work that way, but polyamory specifically is that's not the goal, basically, for mostpeople that are polyamorous. And I think that, too, is a misconception ‘cause a lot ofpeople come to our meetings about polyamory and call it ethical non-monogamy, and it'slike, well, they're related, but they're not really the same (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexualwoman, 46, middle class)Here, Sylvia recollected the moments where newcomers to the poly group lacked an accurateunderstanding of polyamory. To her, polyamory was more than extradyadic sex, whichdifferentiated it from the general CNM. A similar mindset was witnessed by Lynna in herpolyamorous experiences, where some approached polyamory with a “free-for-all” mindset,which was contrary to Lynna’s understanding of polyamory where rules and boundary settingshould be an ongoing process to avoid hurting partners. In addition, Elijah experiences CNMfriends’ misperception of polyamory as an open relationship.My partner has disclosed it to a few people only after they disclosed their situations…When we say “We're poly, or we lean more in that, we kind of lean more that direction.”165They're like, “Oh, you mean you're open.” And it's “No, we're not open” because thatdifference makes is really important to me, because it doesn't describe who I actually am,right? Just calling myself queer or gay, or whatever. And so they'll go, “Oh, but you'reactually open right?” “No, we're not.” (Elijah, cis biracial gay man, 36, upper-middleclass)For Elijah, the misperception of polyamory as an open relationship was rooted in the “hook-up”culture and the prevalence of open relationships in the gay community. As he emphasized, thedifference between polyamory and open relationships was crucial to acknowledging hisdemisexual identity.Meanwhile, some participants reflected on their experiences of biases against theirpolyamorous relationship based on their sexuality and gender. For example,We opened up our marriage because there had always been a thought or a thread ofpracticing polyamory or having an open marriage since we had gotten together as acouple not necessarily just as a married couple. Also, it was one of those things where,when we started having discussions early in our relationship, it was something where hewould have been more comfortable if we were both just seeing other women. My, in poly,they call that OPP; they call it a one penis policy, which means he can see other women, Ican see other women, but I then can't see other men. That's inequitable, so that wasn'tanything that I then pursued. I was like “It's gonna be, it's gonna be more equitable, orthis isn't gonna happen.” So it didn't happen. (Rachel, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 39,working-middle class)Here, Rachel remembered her perceived unfairness and inequity from previous discussions withher nesting partner about polyamory led her to reject the idea of OPP (i.e., one penis policy)166polyamory. Later with continuous negotiations with his nesting partner, the dyad finally enteredpolyamory with an equitable agreement. Similarly, while Cat and Amy had not personallyexperienced such explicit unfairness, they witnessed the prevalence of OPP in the polyamory andCNM community. In addition,My bisexuality, it’s interesting in that way, is that I found that men seem to be okay withthe concept of having a female partner, of me having a female partner in a way they arenot with there being another male partner. They'll find something attractive with meseeing another woman, and I think there's sort of this weird, it's not as real if it's awoman, you know. Yeah, that the cult of the penis, the idea that like, that's what's actuallypowerful. That's what’s gonna change me and sway me. And so that's an interesting thing,is it's like men will be okay with the concept of their girlfriend having girlfriends, but thesecond a guy looks at her sideways, it's, that's when the jealousy kicks in. They'll evenfetishize both my bisexuality and my polyamory for other women. (Amy, cis Whitebisexual woman, 25, lower-middle class)Here, Amy elaborated on her confusion about the sexual double standards of some male partnerson her bisexual and polyamorous experiences with people of different genders. She attributed theinternalized patriarchy to their negative attitudes toward her bisexual experiences with men.Similarly, Rosa also experienced such sexual double standards in her polyamorous experiences.The other thing is that I had to let go of some friendships because I don't feel comfortablewith jokes. I don't feel comfortable with people questioning that my husband is less of aman because he's allowing me to do this, because I'm the one with the boyfriend rightnow. He doesn't, he's not dating right now. And that to me is disrespectful, and even in167the small jokes, and even, I just rather go away from that, from that group that is not goodfor me. (Rosa, cis Latinx bisexual woman, 42, middle class)Here, Rosa discussed the microaggressions towards her polyamorous experiences that hadcontributed to ending long-term friendships. Some of her friends perceived Rosa’s polyamorousexperiences with other men as a threat to her husband’s masculinity. From her view, suchmicroaggressions disrespected her bisexuality and her husband. Likewise, Puffin remembered aconversation with friends also led to developing a sense of discomfort.When I talked to men about polyamory, they go immediately to “How could you let yourwife or girlfriend or whoever be with somebody else?” And they kinda make, they seemto take a frown to it. They, it’s like, “My God. I can't believe you. I could never do that.”They say that in a way that makes it sound like I'm less of a man for allowing that.(Puffin, cis White pansexual man, upper-middle class)Here, Puffin discussed his encounter with patriarchy when sharing his polyamorous relationshipswith friends. In addition, perceived sexual double standards in society later led Puffin tocommunicate with his partner on the coming-out process to avoid negative impacts on her. Tothese participants, internalized patriarchal beliefs and values contributed to their livedexperiences with anti-poly biases.Moreover, two participants with trans identities discussed how the ongoing trend ofanti-trans legislation had contributed to a perceived existential threat. For example,My entire community is scarred by that. My entire community, the shooting in Coloradoreally fucking tore a scar. Then all these Republican politicians started saying that it wasour fault because we were “grooming children” or whatever. We’re fucking deeplytraumatized. We’re constantly being killed and being the scapegoat for everything. The168most recent trans teenager in the UK, brutal murder just happened. All these people geton TV and spread their hatred and lie. The lies. The fucking lies that they do. If you havethe power to get on TV, and say that, and you spread your lies, people believe you. Wedon’t have a lot of positions where you can speak the truth unless you’re wealthy andhave a platform. If you’re wealthy and have a platform, you’re probably invested in thissystem to begin with. You don’t really have an interest in doing that. I’m very terrified ofthe future of the way that power is continually being consolidated. (Cat, trans Whitepansexual woman, 32, lower class)To Cat, there is a sense of powerlessness and hopelessness underneath her anger toward theattack on the queer community by the political far-rights to deflect the corrupt systems. Sheelaborated on how her understanding of the process of genocides also added to her pessimismabout the future because there is a lack of united activism against the threat of anti-trans trends.Similarly, Jack relayed the unnecessary stress of making decisions on relocation because ofongoing anti-trans legislation in his residing state. In addition, he also shared Cat’s sense ofpowerlessness (i.e., “they could just, instead of doing that, don't do that.”).Lastly, although the impacts of COVID on personal lives were not the focus of theinterviews, some participants shared their unique relationship experiences during the pandemic.For Jack, the intensified sense of isolation during quarantine facilitated his dyad to enterpolyamory and his building long-distance relationships with other partners. Lynna discussed theforced situational monogamy during the COVID pandemic gave the primary dyad an opportunityto deepen their senses of connection and security, which later reduced her primary partner’sperceived threats by her extradyadic experiences. For Rosa, however, the pandemic-relatedstressors (i.e., loss of employment, social quarantine) challenged her previous triadic relationship169(i.e., “no outlets”), which eventually led to relationship dissolution. Through the interviews, allparticipants discussed their encounters with societal challenges, some of which permeated theirpersonal and relational lives and negatively impacted their well-being.Internalization of Adversity Strains Individual and Relational Well-BeingThere were various personal challenges that participants experienced during theirpolyamorous journey, most of which also influenced their relationship experiences with differentpartners. Navigating stigma, shame, jealousy, and past trauma added strain at both the personaland relational levels. Some participants discussed their negative emotions due to theinternalization of hetero/mononormativity. For example,So it's just a shame piece that just, ‘cause it's not like you conquer the shame and youmove on. The shame is still there. It always comes up. It's in, it’s threaded into youreveryday reality. And you, you get better at addressing it, but it never fully goes away. It'sthat internalized homophobia, that internalized heteronormativity is like there's a voice inmy head going. (Elijah, cis biracial gay man, 36, upper-middle class)Here, Elijah discussed the relationship between internalized heteronormativity, himself, and dailylife. For him, internalized heteronormativity is an inner voice that he could only turn down ratherthan turn off. He remembered “grieving” the loss of heterosexual privilege when he came out asgay and desired to follow homonormativity (i.e., “replicate that heterosexuality” “marry” “havekids”). In his polyamorous relationships, he described the constant confrontation with shame dueto internalized hetero/mononormativity. Likewise, Gabe briefed how his “own shame” about his“kinks” and sexual preferences had challenged open communication with his nesting partnerwhen they started polyamorous exploration. As for Dominic, the internalized heteronormativity170delayed his healing process of sexual trauma that had changed his sexuality over time andchallenged his relationship with his nesting partner. In addition,As far as heteronormative society, I feel a lot of my frustration with that is kind ofembodied through [metamour] of what [metamour] expects, heteronormative monogamy,you know, a lot of those beliefs that I kind of thought is more external to the unit feelslike it's inside the unit. And that's been a challenge for me, even though I can admit thathe's making progress. (Peter, cis White gay man, 29, upper-middle class)For Peter, the hetero/mononormativity came within his polycule, in which metamour’sinternalized hetero and monogamous beliefs had created a challenge for him. Specifically, hediscussed the reinforcement of hierarchy from metamour contributed to an ongoing powerstruggle among members in the polycule. There was a sense of powerlessness and sadness inPeter as he continued to develop a polyamorous relationship with his partner in the hierarchicalstructure (e.g., “[partner] and I are being kept from each other” “more crying”). In addition, hismetamour also developed negative attitudes toward him, which eventually led Peter and him tobe “antagonistic with each other.” Such a sense of powerlessness was also shared by Sylvia inher previous polyamorous relationship with a couple.I did try to date a married couple at one point, and that was extremely difficult becausethere is so many relationship connections. So it was like me and the wife, and then meand the husband, and then me and the married couple. Because they would haveconversations, and then come tell me about their conversations, and I'm like, “Shouldn't Ibe involved in that conversation if it affects me?” And they only wanted to date metogether, which is, it was very hard for me. I wanted to make connections individuallywith them. (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 46, middle class)171For Sylvia, the sense of powerlessness in relationship decision-making and development camefrom being a unicorn (i.e., a third partner joining with an existing couple to create a triad orthrouple) in a hierarchical relationship based on an extension of heteronormativity. For theseparticipants, the relational influence of individuals’ internalized hetero/mononormativitymanifested in different ways.In addition, some participants shared how their trauma or adversity negatively impactedtheir polyamorous relationships. For example,Things fell apart a little bit with my platonic partner. It happened, and that was more withdrama, with someone else he was seeing. I had the impression that she was lessconsenting to it than she was giving him the impression of. I was, I got the feeling that heput off telling her about me too long, and that made me uncomfortable. I didn't want to bea part of that, so I was like, “Listen, I gotta step back. This reminds me too much of whatI've been through before. I can't be a part of this.” (Amy, cis White bisexual woman, 25,lower-middle class)Earlier, Amy discussed her confusion over her ex-fiancé’s opposite attitudes and behaviorstoward her polyamorous relationship (supportive prior to extradyadic sex v.s explosionafterward). The retraumatization in her relationship with her platonic partner and metamourresulted in her withdrawal from that polyamorous relationship. Similarly, Rachel and Glennremembered the “pain” and “hurt” from their partners’ infidelity in monogamy contributed to asense of mistrust and insecurity as they explored polyamory together. Rachel also identified agenerational pattern in one of her previous polyamorous relationships.When I began establishing a friendship with his wife and sharing her experiences of whather relationship with [partner] was like, it became clear that he was censoring and very172heavily curating my perceptions of how he conducted himself towards me and alsotowards his wife. He was gaslighting and lying to both of us, either outright or byomission. He would use the idea that was jealous or feeling insecure against me bymaking me feel immature and irrational for experiencing these emotions. (Rachel, cisWhite bi/pansexual woman, 39, working-middle class)Rachel remembered her witnessing and involuntary involvement in the emotional abuse andinfidelity of her father toward her mother, which traumatically influenced her values onrelationships and marriage. Here, she pointed out the generational pattern where she hadexperienced similar emotional abuse and dishonesty in her previous polyamorous relationships,which led her to “question my self-awareness” and “emotional distress.” In addition, Gabebriefly discussed how individuals’ past traumas were manifested and amplified in polyamorousrelationships through a sense of fear and insecurity in relationship stability, which thencontributed to relationship “tumultuousness.” It is noteworthy that although some participantsreflected on the relationship challenges due to past trauma or adversity, no participants impliedor stated the association between trauma and the decision to enter polyamory.Furthermore, jealousy is not absent in participants’ polyamorous relationships. For veryfew, such as Cat and Lynna, the feeling of compersion is constant in their relationship, whichcontributes to the rarity of jealousy. For many others, however, jealousy “creeps in” from time totime. For example,I had to learn not to be jealous. I grew up in a very traditional [ethnic] environment, andyou even think that jealousy is a helpful thing and acting out on it; it's a healthy thing.That's how I grew up. And that's how I was for 15, 10 years of my life with my husband.I was extremely jealous, controlling, and we had to do a lot with my own insecurities. But173opening up and going through the process of becoming polyamorous has helped metremendously as well as him because we feel so secure with each other. We're gonna betogether for a very long time at least, while we're still trying to make it work. And thejealousy part did hit my husband, who is not a jealous person, and we work through that,as well as me when I was constantly jealous. (Rosa, cis Latinx bisexual woman, 42,middle class)Here, Rosa discussed how her jealousy was conditioned by her own ethnic community as a toolto manipulate her relationship experiences in monogamous marriage. As jealousy arose from asense of insecurity, she experienced various relational challenges at the beginning stage of herpolyamorous explorations with her nesting partner. For example, she remembered hercomplicated feelings (e.g., “happy” “jealous”) when her nesting partner developed extradyadicrelationships and her challenges in respecting her partner’s privacy in other relationships. Inaddition, insecurity-driven jealousy was evident in some other participants’ relationshipexperiences. Specifically,I definitely think it [jealousy] was personal insecurities. With her being with somebodyelse, the sexual decline happened a little bit in the beginning, so I was insecure aboutwhether I was providing enough gratification to her in that area. I didn't interact with himas often, so I didn't know what they were talking about or what his intent was. So I’ll besitting there thinking what if she likes him better than me, and she does want to leave ourrelationship, because, even though I am absolutely amazing, he's also pretty cool? Sothere are definitely some insecurities going on in my side of the area to where I wasn'tsure what she was thinking, or maybe he would get jealous, and wherever way that felt to174him, and not want to be in a poly relationship with her, and kind of put a choice on her.(Puffin, cis White pansexual man, upper-middle class)Puffin pointed out that the sense of insecurity contributed to feeling jealous at the beginningstage of his Vee relationship. The uncertainty about the changing relationship dynamic andcomparison between self and metamour led him to question the relationship stability with hispartner. Later, he conveyed that such a sense of insecurity was also shared by his metamour atthe beginning due to skepticism of each other’s attitudes toward the Vee relationship.Furthermore, Sylvia discussed her insecurities in a previously monogamous relationshipcontributed to “self-sabotaging” behaviors that eventually led to relationship dissolution. In herpolyamorous relationships, her “self-esteem issues” contributed to a sense of insecurity in herdyadic relationship when her nesting partner was “very excited” about her metamour.While these participants reflected on how their own jealousy influenced their relationshipexperiences, a few remembered the relational challenges they had experienced due to thejealousy of their partners. For example,I was constantly reassuring my fiancé, saying, “No, no, no, I still have feelings, exactlythe same way. This doesn't steal from my feelings for you.” Like “This isn't gonna makeme want to leave you.” You know, “I don't want to leave you for him, because that's nothow I'm feeling.” You know, “It's not like one or the other.” You know we didn't talk, butit ended up being like I have to talk to him, reassure him, and comfort him for hoursevery day. (Amy, cis White bisexual woman, 25, lower-middle class)Amy discussed how her communication with her ex-fiancé after entering polyamory started tocenter on reassurance and comfort to reduce his insecurities. For her, her ex-fiancé’s insecurities175manifesting in the daily polyamorous experiences contradicted his claim that “he was not ajealous person.” Similarly,It's something that my partner has articulated that he doesn't think he'll ever get to. He'skind of like, \"I don't think that's on the table for me. I think what we're shooting for isneutral.\" He's like, \"As long as your other relationships aren't hurting me, that's kind ofwhat we should be shooting for. Don't hurt me with your actions.\" But I mean, he kind offeels pretty confident that he doesn't think he's capable of experiencing compersion at thethought of me hooking up with someone else. (Lynna, cis Asian bisexual woman, 28,middle class)For Lynna, her primary partner’s feelings towards her polyamorous experienced would fluctuatebased on perceived impact on himself. Lynna remembered constant negotiation of rules andboundaries to balance her own autonomy in polyamorous experiences and her primary partner’ssense of security in the established hierarchical structure. For these participants, insecurity wasthe primary factor contributing to the feeling of jealousy in their polyamorous relationships. Forsome others, jealousy arose from the desire for longingness. Particularly,Where, in the way that I feel like most people experience when they are interested insomeone new, right? There's a lot of you know, warm, fuzzy feelings, and wanting to bewith them all the time. And you know lots of hugs and kisses and love letters andplaylists, you know, like all that kind of crap, and where [nesting partner] and I have beentogether for 5 years. A lot of our relationship has kind of burned down to something thatis very steady and no less affectionate, but kind of lacks some of those grand gestures.And so there's always been like an understanding of, I get that this is not happeningbecause you like them more than me, just because it's new and exciting. But also, “When176was the last time you made me a playlist, bud?” (Jack, trans White pansexual man, 27,upper-middle class)For Jack, the “jealousy-like” feelings were derived from longing for excitement, affection, andrelationship gestures at the early stage of the dyadic relationship. He also perceived challenges inapproaching communication on relationship gestures with his nesting husband because it couldbe “tricky” for causing perceived blaming or misunderstanding (i.e., “Why don't you do thosethings with me anymore? ”). Similarly, Gabe and Elijah also discussed how they or their partnersexperienced jealousy in polyamorous relationships due to longingness (i.e., “fear of missingout”). For these participants, there was a lower level of jealousy in their relationships eventhough they perceived a high level of relationship stability and security. In sum, jealousy ebbsand flows in most of the participants’ relationships.Multi-Partnership Amplifies Relational ComplexityThis sub-theme reflects the added relationship complexity due to the nature of amulti-partnership. Participants discussed how the involvement of multiple partners andmetamours simultaneously created relational challenges. It seemed universal across participantsthat scheduling quality time with partners was challenging. For example,This is gonna sound so dumb (chuckle). But there's only so many colors on GoogleCalendar. Like, look at this, look at this (show his Google calendar). Okay, like this is juststupid. This is what I see every day, and Google only has so many colors for me to livemy life. I needed, I need more colors…And so that becomes, that is a practical butactually a really central issue, right? Because when you're dating so many people, thetime that we're spending with each other is important. And I'm not suggesting to be asany retentive as like, “I want like a weekly report like how much time did I spend with177each of these people,” like “How am I doing” so I can like, “Oh, hang on a minute, likemy metrics are down last week for partner number three, I need to bump that up. Butmore just because of a sense of like, “Oh, I'm doing this thing” like, ‘Who have I invited’or like ‘How many people am I expecting” like “Is my parking spot gonna be availableright now?” Or, it becomes very…There's a lot of practicalities, which one conventionalcalendar just doesn't really handle. (Dominic, cis White gay man, 37, upper class)Here, Dominic pointed out a practical challenge in scheduling differentiated events with partnersas such differentiation was not supported by conventional calendars. Similarly, Rachel, Gabe,and Lynna also discussed balancing self-care and quality time with different partners based ontheir schedules could be challenging. For Glenn, scheduling was still challenging even in herclosed triad.I'm someone who likes to plan things when I'm in the mood, my mind works really fast,and I get ideas, and I want to make plans. And with two other people you have to consult,phew, it slows me down you know, So it's just different that I can't just go and schedulethings and make plans and I have to wait till we're all together to be able to talk about it.By then, I'd have like a list of 5 things, and that can be overwhelming, you know, to theother person. ‘Cause my wife is more of a processor and can get overwhelmed whenpresented with a whole list of things, my husband's kind of quick with that kind of stuff.So for her, to come home after a long day of work and for me to fire off 5 different thingsto think about, it's like a lot. So I had to adjust there and say, “When is a good time for meto run some things by you.” And maybe even plan the time so that everyone knows we'regonna sit down and talk about some scheduling things. Otherwise, I can createoverwhelm, and I've noticed that. (Glenn, cis White pansexual woman, 43, middle class)178There was a challenge in scheduling triadic events due to multi-partnership and differentplanning styles and personalities among partners. For Glenn, scheduling a meeting for a triadicmeeting to schedule events was often needed to avoid overwhelming one partner. In addition, forthree participants (i.e., Luna, Jack, Sylvia), child-rearing added complexity in schedulingbecause they and their nesting partners need to consider childcare when scheduling relationshipevents as a dyad and with extradyadic partners. As aforementioned, it is common thatparticipants expressed limited time for their multi-partnered relationship maintenance. Rosa’sexperience was an excellent summary,I believe that you can love indefinitely; the only thing that's limited is time. That's what Irun into. Time is the killer, and the killer of relationships, too. (Rosa, cis Latinx bisexualwoman, 42, middle class)Here, Rosa pointed out the finiteness of time in maintaining relationships even though love couldbe infinite. The metaphor “time is the killer,” based on Rosa’s experiences, had two meanings.As she tried to manage different relationships in polyamory, she encountered moments when shestrained her relationships because of prioritizing one over others. In addition, she implied thedecline of relationship satisfaction in monogamy over time. Particularly, Rosa experiencedchanges in her own values, beliefs, and expectations, which could have destroyed her marriage ifthe dyad were not polyamorous.Another prevalent relational challenge existed in many participants’ polyamorousexperiences due to the relationship structure. Particularly, some participants discussed difficultiesin establishing and balancing boundaries. For example,Because the three of us are so close now, if there's an issue between him and I, or him andher, and like I wanna help, but I also feel like I shouldn't get really involved in it. So I'm179like open to listening, and you know, if they wanna throw information off me, I'm finewith that. But like, we basically handle those individually like, it's not like a three-personmeeting, like our relationship is our relationship, and their relationship is theirrelationship. And I don't wanna get, if there's something going on between them, I don'twant to be, you know, pulled into that necessarily. (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexualwoman, 46, middle class)Here, Sylvia pointed to the emotional proximity with her partner and metamour creating achallenge for her to balance between providing relational support and maintaining the boundariesof two separate relationships. She continued to discuss the unique challenges in her previousexperience of providing support to her partner throughout a polyamorous relationship lifespan(i.e., dating, conflict, dissolution), because she needed to manage her own emotions and maintainappropriate boundaries. Similarly, for many other participants, managing boundaries betweenseparate polyamorous relationships was challenging. For example, Puffin discussed hisdiscomfort with his partner sharing his personal information and dyadic relationship withmetamour. For him, relational boundaries must be maintained in the current Vee relationshipuntil developing a deeper bond between the three of them. In addition, some participantsdiscussed relationship challenges where they experienced negativity between their partners. Forexample,One person tried to throw [nesting partner] under the bus for something. And I was like,and it was something that didn't sound like something [nesting partner] would do. And Iwas like, “Why would you shit-talk [nesting partner] to my face?” “Of all people, like[nesting partner] is my husband. I love them dearly. This doesn't make me want to talk to180you, you know, at all. In fact, I would rather you get away from me now.” (Gabe, cisAsian gay man, 33, middle class)Gabe remembered one encounter where he ended the relationship with one ex-partner whodisrespected his nesting partner. For him, it was crucial that potential partners maintained theboundary by demonstrating respect for his current partnerships. Similarly, Lynna also withdrewherself from polyamorous relationships when perceiving disrespect for her primary partners orprimary partnership. In addition, Lynna and Luna discussed their challenges in navigatingrelationships because of the veto power of their nesting or primary partners. Both participantsreflected on the negotiations with their partners to determine how to proceed with polyamorousrelationships. The hierarchy itself posited a boundary between their dyadic and extradyadicrelationships where Luna and Lynna needed to balance “delicately.” While by agreement theirnesting or primary partners could dictate their polyamorous relationships to some extent,extradyadic partners did not have such power to cross the relationship boundary.Earlier, Jack discussed how long-distance relationships and neurodivergence contributedto experiencing the phenomenon of emotional object permanence in maintaining relationships.Similarly, Luna, Peter, and Cat reflected on physical distance as a barrier to relationshipdevelopment or maintenance. For example, Cat remembered one of her polyamorousrelationships had dissolved due to her partners’ relocation. For Luna and Peter, residing indifferent states with some partners contributed to a sense of uncertainty in their relationshipoutlooks.Furthermore, most participants discussed the challenges in communication with theirpartners. For some, a lack of openness, transparency, and honesty contributed to relationalproblems at some point in their polyamorous relationships. For example,181Then a thing came up where my husband came to me after months of flirting with thiswoman and said, “Hey, I've got this thing with a woman all set up for us.” And I didn'tknow he had been doing that, and then a bit later, he confessed that there had been someinfidelity as well, and it ended up being a very hurtful situation. It took a long time for usto work through that hurt. (Glenn, cis White pansexual woman, 43, middle class)Glenn remembered the emotional harm caused by her husband’s dishonesty in communicationand infidelity led the dyad to withdraw from polyamorous exploration to heal the dyadicrelationship wound. It took the dyad years to rebuild the trust through consistent communicationto resume their polyamorous journey. Similarly, Peter also briefed withholding certaininformation about extradyadic experiences from nesting partners, which contributed to emotionalpain. Amy also experienced a sense of confusion after her ex-fiancé finally revealed his truefeelings about her polyamorous relationshipsBut then, the first time I had sex with my friend. I got home, and my ex-fiancé lost hismind, absolute screaming at me, furious. And it kind of turned out that he'd sort ofsecretly, internally been thinking of this as like a test, like, “If you love her, let her go,and she'll come back.” And I'd failed. And this was very confusing, because he had beenfully supportive up until that point, and we've been communicating so much. (Amy, cisWhite bisexual woman, 25, lower-middle class)Amy felt confused by the sudden changes in her ex-fiancé’s attitudes and behaviors towardpolyamory after her first experience of extradyadic sex. Her ex-fiancé’s explosion to herextradyadic encounter made her realize the concealment of his true intention for supportingpolyamory: A test of her love and commitment to monogamy with him. The revelation of herex-fiancé true attitudes and feelings toward polyamory eventually contributed to Amy dissolving182two relationships, including her engagement and polyamorous relationship. In addition, herexperiences of emotional manipulation in her previous engagement caused a lasting negativeimpact on her later polyamorous relationships, as she developed nervousness and anxiety indisclosing sexual experiences due to perceived concern about her partner’s unacceptance.Amy was not alone in having the challenge of discussing sexual experiences withpartners. In fact, several other participants commented that sex-related topics were the mostchallenging in their communication with their partners. For example, Gabe briefed about hisshame and embarrassment in talking about his kinks and sexual preferences with his nestingpartner when they started their polyamorous exploration. For Dominic, the discomfort inaddressing sex-related topics persisted in his polyamorous relationships.It took a very long time for that to be anything like comfort around sex. I still don't feellike it's necessarily there. I still think that there's a kind of, you know, if [metamour] ishere, whenever [metamour] is here, the white noise machine would be beyond thebedroom or something. But the white noise machine, I use it in my office for clients, butthey use it, they use it when having sex, or be told that euphemistically right? (Dominic,cis White gay man, 37, upper class)For Donomic, the white noise machine was a euphemistic way to indicate sexual encountersbetween his nesting partner and metamour, and the dyad continued to improve their comfort incommunicating sex-related topics. Even though his articulation of past sexual trauma helped thedyad address their sexual incompatibility, such an incompatibility continued to linger in theirrelationship dynamic. In contrast, Luna experienced challenges in setting sexual boundaries withnon-primary partners. Specifically,183 I feel like the barrier talk is often uncomfortable. People can talk about fluid bonding, allthat stuff, basically having unprotected sex…But that can be a difficult conversationsometimes because emotionally, there's something to not using barriers. You’re definitelymore naked, literally with that person, and so that can be uncomfortable having to talk…(Luna, cis White pansexual woman, 46, upper-middle class)Here, Luna reflected on the discomfort of communicating sexual boundaries because they couldelicit certain emotional reactions. She continued discussing how different attitudes toward andcosts of testing could complicate communications on sexual safety with non-primary partners.For these participants, approaching sex-related topics with partners contributed to personaldiscomfort, which many had made individual and relational efforts to address it. In addition, asall participants experienced various levels of challenges, they also managed to build a supportsystem to help maintain their personal and relational well-being.GET Five: Ecological Systems for Relationship MaintenanceThis GET encompasses the strengths, resources, and resiliencies that participants built toaddress various challenges in their relationship maintenance. All participants credited theirpersonal effort and relational support, especially in relationship communication, for managingrelationship problems. For some, accessing community resources and cultures facilitated a senseof belonging, normalization, and liberation.Ongoing Personal Work for GrowthThis sub-theme reflects the personal efforts participants have made to achieve personalgrowth in deepening self-understanding and managing their polyamorous relationships. Thisongoing work included the development of critical consciousness, self-acceptance, flexibility,and relational factors such as relationship effort, quality time with partners, and awareness of184partners' needs/wants. For many participants, literature was a resource to obtain informationalsupport. For example,A lot of times it's just me reading also. There's a lot of resources on the Internet. Youhave to be careful which ones you choose of course, but even there are books out. There,just recently finished reading Polysecure. (Rosa, cis Latinx bisexual woman, 42, middleclass)Here, Rosa discussed seeking guidance and education from reaching high-quality materials tonavigating relationship challenges. Similarly, Dominic also mentioned the importance ofselecting non-heteronormative polyamory literature to gain relationship education. Rachel,Glenn, Peter, Sylvia, and Elijah also echoed the usefulness of seeking personal and relationalwisdom from books or other materials. While these participants voiced different opinions aboutpopular polyamory books, the book Polysecure was universally praised by them. Specifically,Dominic, Gabe, and Sylvia especially appreciated approaching polyamorous relationships froman attachment perspective. Specifically,And like, I've been, I'm enjoying, uhm, I forget which one it is, the attachment theoryfocused one where… (Interviewer: Polysecure?) Yes, Polysecure. I’m enjoying that one,where they're using a bit more attachment work, attachment healing involves relationshipand connections (Gabe, cis Asian gay man, 33, middle class)For Gabe, the emphasis of individuals in some other polyamory literature still reflect whitesupremacy in polyamory. Focusing on communal healing rather than individualistic healingprovides an “antidote” to white supremacy. He later discussed decolonizing white supremacy asan important component of his polyamorous experiences. Similarly, Dominic sided with Gabethat a lack of social discourse on the healing of attachment trauma perpetuates a sense of185isolation and insecurity that hinders relationship development. He read Polysecure andrecommended it to his poly friends for community healing.In addition, many participants reflected on developing a critical consciousness that helpedconfront and resist oppressive messages. For example,Essentially what I've had to do is throw out my entire value system that is built onChristianity, Mormonism, you know Western ideals of family and everythingheteronormativity, all I had to throw it all out, and there's, there's nothing left. What doyou use then, as your value system If you had to throw out everything else that hasoppressed you? So slowly, I've had to recreate and rebuild my own version of my values,and over in, the kind of key ingredients have been empathy, connection, and ethics…Iforgot the fourth one, which is consent (Elijah, cis biracial gay man, 36, upper-middleclass)For Elijah, living against Christianity, heteronormativity, and mononormativity could beexhausting and non-productive. It is crucial for him to deconstruct his old value system based onthese types of normativity and recreate a new one to liberate him from shame about his sexualand polyamorous identities and create meaningful polyamorous relationships. Similarly, Lynnatried to deconstruct traditional beliefs in the institution of marriage through a disidentificationprocess to “subvert” the traditional definition of “spouse identity” in polyamory. For her, theterms “marriage” and “wife” were defined by herself and the dyad, rather than the outsideperception. “Chop” and “bleach” her hair, “change my pronouns,” and “dress more masculine”after her wedding were her efforts for resistance to the traditional definitions of a “spouse”identity. In addition,186I’m a wife, but again, I’m a wife in my way. I’m a wife who still gets to have sex withstrangers, and I’m a wife who gets to flirt as much as she wants to and who's going tosend her husband on vacation to Miami with his hot single female friend. (Lynna, cisAsian bisexual woman, 28, middle class)Again, Lynna managed to develop her definition of marriage and spouse through herpolyamorous relationship experiences. Correspondingly, Rosa had gone through a process ofdeconstructing the conditioned value system based on Catholicism and the ethnic community inher home countryThe only standard, the only standard that we've seen is just marriage, one person forever,and the longevity of the marriage is what makes it happy, and that's not true sometimes,it's more short amounts of chapters in your book, like I call it. You can be happy. You canbe, and you can find contentment in many ways. (Rosa, cis Latinx bisexual woman, 42,middle class)Rosa discussed reconstructing her relationship philosophy under which she could find happinessand fulfill changing needs in different short chapters rather than in the longevity of monogamy.For her, disclosing her polyamorous relationships and experiences to her cousins and sister wasan intentional effort to set an example of exploring one’s own happiness instead of followingpre-established norms. Similarly, developing political and moral radicalism, such as “moralantirealism,” “anti-capitalism,” “anti-white supremacy” and “anti-authoritarianism,” Cat focusedon empathizing and reducing the current suffering in the queer and poly community.Furthermore, some participants reflected on the benefits of counseling in managingpersonal and/or relational issues. For example,187Mainly I use my counselor. I had a counselor that I, (pause) that it's I guess impartial andhelps me whenever we have issues. And they're friendly to their LGBTQ+ community,and they are supportive, and they understand the, it's slightly, I guess because I don'tthink it's very… Anyway, they… I bring my relationship to a counselor so that they helpme navigate certain problems that we're having. And even though it can get expensive,it's, to me, it's worth it because it doesn't put me in a position because I am not good atdealing with this either. So I need guidance, and that's what I’ve done, through anappointment over Zoom to discuss when that issue gets bigger and heavier. (Rosa, cisLatinx bisexual woman, 42, middle class)Here, Rosa pointed out the important characteristics of a multiculturally competent counselor,who helped her navigate challenges in polyamorous experiences. Similarly, Gabe summarizedhis current counselor’s curiosity, humility, acknowledgment, and validation of his polyamorousrelationships strengthened their therapeutic relationships and facilitated positive counselingexperiences. In addition, Dominic stressed another important benefit of having a polyamorouscounselor.The therapist, who is, themselves, poly…The person whose appointment is right beforeme in the office with my therapist is my ex-boyfriend’s new boyfriend, right? I, we meetin the hallway, and it's like, “Oh hey, I don't know you started to see him. And it’s like“We see each other once a week.” And it's now got the point, so my friend goes to him,and then I refer someone else who's now his 10 o'clock on Thursday morning, and his 10o'clock’s husband is [friend] husband's client. And suddenly it's like the sense ofcommunity is initially kind of terrifying, when you're like, “Well, if I fuck thisrelationship up, suddenly that goes everything. But then it so very quickly twists into,188“Oh, hang on a minute, there is more color, texture to be found in connections withpeople with whom you like in a relationship and then not, but that doesn't stop you fromhaving connection to them. (Dominic, cis White gay man, 37, upper class)Here, Dominic pointed out the sense of community built around polyamorous clients andcounselors, even though intricate connections could be challenging to navigate. For him, there isa crucial difference between a counselor being “knowledgeable” and a counselor with “livedexperiences” of polyamory or CNM; the latter acknowledged the diversity in polyamorous andCNM relationships. In contrast, Peter and Lynna discussed the benefits of counseling inaddressing non-polyamorous problems or issues. In sum, almost all participants utilizedcounseling to facilitate their personal growth at some point in their lives.Moreover, most participants made personal efforts (e.g., self-reflection, negotiation,setting boundaries) to address relationship challenges. For example,I do take some pride in the way that I was able to kind of recognize that about myself andhold steadfast in that even as I went through some really not effective and not healthyversions of non-monogamy. I was kind of like, \"Okay, this isn't working, but the conceptis good. We're still going to make this work for us somehow. This is not it. This is notworking. So, we need to like to figure out another model that maybe does.” (Lynna, cisAsian bisexual woman, 28, middle class)Lynna remembered the self-examination of her non-monogamous relationship experiences thathelped her explore more healthy models rather than questioning the validity of non-monogamy.Identifying the causes of her relationship failures later motivated her to interact withpolyamorous people to adopt “healthy and ethical” practices. In addition, to overcome the189limitations of scarce poly models, she constantly negotiated with her primary partners onboundaries, expectations, and rules to address personal and relational challenges. Similarly,That's when I was really confronted by myself. It's just like this is gonna keep happening,if like I’m trying to force myself into a monogamous relationship structure withoutmaking it clear to partners that like, “If I'm in a monogamous relationship with you, it's achoice to not act on feelings for other people, not a promise to never have feelings forother people.” I need to really acknowledge this about myself. And so then I spent likethe next year, really exploring that. This last year has been very educational for me interms of my own romantic inclinations. So that was kind of the journey to the fullrealization. (Amy, cis White bisexual woman, 25, lower-middle class)For Amy, the end of her polyamorous relationship with her ex-fiancé and ex-partner forced her toreexamine her relationship orientations. Realizing monogamy was a choice to not act onextradyadic feelings, rather than denying their existence, motivated her to liberate herself fromfear and make relationship decisions based on her true feelings. In addition, most participantsstressed the “trust” in their relationships as one of the most important resiliency that had beenmotivating them to overcome challenges in polyamory. Furthermore, it is worth noting that allparticipants continued to develop and maintain their polyamorous relationships despite varioustypes of challenges, which itself is resiliency. Some participants named this effort an authentic“being” and “living.” For example,I was just like, “You know what? I’m just going to be openly queer, openly autistic,openly polyamorous, openly trans.” It was like a freaking mental load was lifted off ofme…Just committing to being just completely open and honest about everything. It’s190nice. It was just really, really nice. That’s one of the guiding principles I live my life by.(Cat, trans White pansexual woman, 32, lower class)Here, Cat discussed how disclosing her queer, trans, and polyamorous identities to her parentsliberated her from the “baggage” of identity concealment. For her, it became essential to liveopenly and authentically with who she was despite the perceived danger to her life. Similarly,Glenn discussed her sense of pride in living authentically and creating a meaningful triadicrelationship in the face of stress over the concealment of polyamorous relationships. In fact, allparticipants implied authenticity as resiliency as they continued to stay true to their sexuality andpolyamorous inclinations.Togetherness in Addressing ChallengesThis sub-theme describes the importance of team support in the face of personal orrelational adversities. All participants emphasized “we” and “us” when reflecting on overcomingtheir personal or relational challenges in their polyamorous experiences, which indicated a strongsense of togetherness with their partners and/or metamours. For example,It again comes down to like jumping in both feet first, like I know, I know what the poolthat [one partner] looks, and I know [the other partner] Pool. And there's a matter of likeyour relationship with your metas as well, the other members of the village that's takingcare of them, and being able to have that, those lines of communication open, you needthem. Like, not having to bear the brunt and take the weight of everything yourself, andmeeting those challenges head-on, and doing whatever you know is within yourcapability to take care of this other person, and be able to say to your metas, “Hey, I'mhaving these experiences. Can you shed any light on what's going on so that way I knowexactly what I'm dealing with?” And just really again, just both feet forward, jump right191in, and let's tackle this together, and see what we can do. (Rachel, cis White bi/pansexualwoman, 39, working-middle class)Here, Rachel stressed the importance of collaboration in her polycule for personal and relationalsupport. She believed it also takes a “village” to take care of an adult. For her, being fullyinvolved in polyamorous relationships, socializing with metamours, and making joint efforts addstrengths to address challenges. Likewise, Sylvia remembered moments when metamourssupported her childcare, which reduced her logistical and emotional pressure.Similar to Rachel, many other participants remembered seeking insights or perspectivesfrom their partners in relationship problems. For Donomic,I guess the one advantage I have is I can also consult people whom I've been in arelationship with, so they have a little more insight into the dynamics. So I, ‘cause I couldbe like, “Hey, hey, guys, you know what it's like having me as a boyfriend, like you havea perspective on this thing.” (Dominic, cis White gay man, 37, upper class)Dominic’s multi-partnership helped him gain more perspective to assess himself in relationships.He remembered his other partners reassured him when being blamed for relationship conflict byone partner (i.e., “those things that that person said about you, we don't believe that they're truebecause we have data about how we..”). As quoted in an earlier section, showing his emotionalpain of relationship dissolution in front of his nesting partner and receiving support from himwas “strange” and “new” but “a great strength.” Such a phenomenon was also experienced byother participants, including Lynna, Luna, Rosa, and Elijah, as they discussed that they couldalways count on their nesting or primary partners if their extradyadic relationships ended. Forthese participants, relational support from other partners was a unique strength that polyamory192provided. Furthermore, Puffin also perceived another relational support unique to polyamorousrelationships.In the fact that the older you get, God forbid something happens to somebody, in aone-on-one partner relationship, that sense of loss is… It creates a lot of grief, and youhave friends, and you have family you can lean on. But the idea that if you're in a partnerrelationship, if you do come across that sense of loss, you have somebody absolutelycares about you and loves you and will help you through that loss while they're grievingthrough and going through the same motions. (Puffin, cis White pansexual man,upper-middle class)Here, Puffin pointed out a perceived relational resilience in multi-partnership in the loss of apartner. To him, there is a difference between grieving with partners and receiving support fromparents or friends.In addition, many participants discussed that the continuous commitment and effort theyand their partners had made strengthened the trust, understanding, and security in theirpolyamorous relationships. For example,And so we had to work through those triggers that we had for each other. But it's, and it'sbeen a long, you know, long 8-year process. But we've gotten to a point now, where likeif something's bothering me, we both trust each other now to the point, where it's stillmuch easier to talk about things because we're in, we've learned the triggers, and workedthrough them. (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 46, middle class)Here, Sylvia pointed out the continuous dyadic effort contributed to a deeper trust andunderstanding of different communication styles, which eventually improved theircommunication. Sylvia remembered providing support to her nesting partner in healing from193childhood emotional abuse to differentiate emotional expressions and blaming. Similarly, Jackalso discussed the ongoing dyadic effort in deepening their relationship, which helped overcomerelational challenges because of different communication styles and affectional needs. ForLynna, an increased sense of connection, stability, and security with her primary partnerbenefited both of them in polyamorous experiences (e.g., “compersion,” less perceived “threat”by extradyadic partners). In fact, many participants resonated with Lynna’s experiences. As theyworked individually and together with their partner to deepen trust and security, jealousy becamemore manageable, and some started to experience the feeling of compersion more frequently.Personal and Relational Efforts in Managing JealousyMany participants discussed making various types of efforts to address jealousy in theirpolyamorous relationships. For some, the process started within themselves. Particularly,When processing jealousy and processing anger or my views on certain things, I havebeen able to stop and think… I'd ask myself “Why am I feeling this way?” if I'm jealousabout something, why am I jealous about it? And that's when I really kind of went in adeep think mode, forwarding through all the reasons why, like “Oh, it's because of thisinsecurity.” “Why do you feel this insecurity?” (Puffin, cis White pansexual man,upper-middle class)Here, Puffin pointed out that personal reflection helped him process feelings of jealousy or anger,which facilitated his personal growth in polyamorous relationships. Gaining a deeperunderstanding of his feeling helped him increase his sense of security and confidence in himselfand his relationships. Similarly,I’ve learned to hold on, to let go of anger or jealousy by working on myself, looking in,in myself “Why am I feeling like this? Why am I feeling insecure? Why am I feeling194sad?” And then I address it, and a lot of times it has to do with me feeling insecure aboutmyself (Rosa, cis Latinx bisexual woman, 42, middle class)The process of self-reflection to process her feelings of anger and jealousy helped Rosa toidentify and address her personal insecurities. Likewise, Sylvia discussed the improvement ofself-esteem through personal work (e.g., “accepting of myself,” “communicate effectively,” “dealwith my own emotions”) increased her confidence in herself and relationships.In addition, a few participants discussed providing relational support to help address thejealousy of their partners. For example,One time [nesting partner] said, “I'm kind of jealous that you got to go to this restaurant,and there was live music, and you had a great time.” And I, and we kind of boil it down;it came down to “I wish I could go with you.” And like “Then let's go, like Thursday? Doyou have time Thursday? Let's go.” And so like just addressing that need or just soothingthat pain and fear, and vice versa for me, too. (Gabe, cis Asian gay man, 33, middle class)Here, Gabe remembered providing support to help process his nesting partner’s feelings ofjealousy. This process helped the dyad to identify the sources of jealousy (unmet needs, longing)and generate solutions (fulfilling the needs, offering comfort). Similarly, Lynna discussed her“healthy” approach to address her primary partner’s jealousy is to validate his feelings, processthe sources of jealousy, and renegotiate rules and boundaries in polyamorous relationships. Tothese participants, open communication with partners to process jealousy helped reduce itsnegative effects on polyamorous relationships.In contrast, a few participants reported that scheduling quality time with partners helpedmanage jealousy in their relationships. For example,195Some of it is like taking active steps to spend more time together. Like, “You know, youand I haven't had a date night in, you know, a couple of months,” like, “Can we set asidesome time to just do stuff right? Have dinner, play video games, whatever.” (Jack, transWhite pansexual man, 27, upper-middle class)For Jack, dyadic effort in planning for quality time together helped address jealous-like feelings.In parallel, Rosa also discussed intentional planning for relationship activities with differentpartners, which reduced their level of jealousy over time.There was a high level of familiarity with the term “compersion” among participants. Asaforementioned, few participants frequently experienced compersion, while some participantsdiscussed managing jealousy helped increase the feeling of compersion. For instance,It’s basically like the, I would say, like it's light and dark, right? So when you take care ofthe problem that's causing jealousy; for me, it was low self-esteem. Then this compersionis much more likely to be able to happen because you're not focusing on thisemotion...And then when she gets all, like “Oh, he's so cute!” Then I'm like, “Oh, he’s socute!” (Sylvia, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 46, middle class)Here, Sylvia used the metaphor “light and dark” to describe the opposition and interconnectionbetween compersion and jealousy. For her, improving her self-esteem, socializing withmetamour, and receiving reassurance of her nesting partner’s commitment helped her reducejealousy to experience more compersion. Similarly, Elijah discussed the rise of compersion in hisprimary partnership from the reassurance of relationship hierarchy to primary partner, knowingprimary partner is desirable, as well as open and non-judgmental communication. In fact, asevident throughout the interview process, communication played a crucial role in all participants’experiences of maintaining and strengthening their polyamorous relationships.196The Cruciality of CommunicationAll participants emphasized the importance of communication throughout their journey inpolyamory. For most participants, open communication started when they entered theirpolyamorous exploration. For example,[Nesting partner] did say, “Peter, no, you're not going to be on the initial selection part.But maybe if I go on a date or two with somebody, and if you'd like to meet them, or lookat their profile, or like, if you notice any red flags about how they're treating with,treating me,” He said, “I will take your word for it.” So kind of similar to veto power tosome extent in the beginning, which made me feel a little bit more comfortable at thetime, but we never explored that because we met [metamour] right away. (Peter, cisWhite gay man, 29, upper-middle class)Here, Peter remembered discussing the selection process of polyamorous partners with hisnesting partner, which increased his sense of power and control in polyamorous relationships.Such experience was shared by many others (e.g., Glenn, Amy, Sylvia, Rosa, Rachel), whodiscussed relationship expectations and rules with their partners when they wanted to open theirrelationships for polyamory. Similarly, Elijah also remembered communicating different CNMconfigurations to identify a fulfilling relationship structure for the dyad.So long as we've been 100% honest with each other, he's been extraordinary, you know,because it'd be very easy for him to be like, “Why can't we just find somebody to fuckand move on?” And I'm like, “We can do that; I can do this, but I'm not getting anythingout of it.” Like “It's just purely, we're inching, we're scratching your itch. I don't getanything out of that, and, quite honestly, it's just something I don't want to do. I'm notinterested in that.” So then he's like, “Well, how do we make this, interesting or197meaningful?” And then that's this way. (Elijah, cis biracial gay man, 36, upper-middleclass)Here, Elijah discussed how open and honest communication between his primary dyad on desireand attraction helped identify a CNM structure that was equitable for both of them. Many otherparticipants also discussed their communication with partners since the beginning of thepolyamorous journey to explore and determine relationship structures.In addition, for most participants, communication meant being “open,” “honest,”“transparent,” and/or “explicit” to talk about anything and everything. For example,Really, just everything, because you have to, you really have to discuss everything, fromthe mundane, like grocery lists, grocery lists, picking up the kids at night, who's makingdinner that kind of thing to “how do you feel about me seeing this person?”... Boundaries.“Are you planning, how far are you planning to go with this person?” “Is kissing okay?”“Is intercourse okay?” “If intercourse is okay, is everybody's testing up to date?”... Soyou're talking about safety. You're talking about the emotions that go along with some ofthese things, talking about the emotional relationships that you have with eachperson…So I can't think of anything we didn't really discuss even if it wasuncomfortable. One of the things that I really enjoyed about polyamory is that I feel likeit makes the uncomfortable more comfortable, or at least helps, for me personally, it'shelped give me the bravery, the confidence to tackle those sensitive subjects that maybeother people, you know, don't wanna tackle. (Luna, cis White pansexual woman, 46,upper-middle class)Here, Luna discussed various topics in her communication with her partners even though somecould elicit discomfort. For her, communicating uncomfortable topics helps her gain insights into198how she and other people operate in relationships. Similarly, Lynna, Sylvia, Puffin, and Dominicdiscussed communication and/or negotiation with their partners about “boundaries,”“responsibilities,” “rules,” and“expectations” to balance different relationships. In addition,Puffin discussed polyamorous experiences that helped him realize the importance of opencommunication in polyamory.The polyamory that I've experienced, the communication is just so much more open thanwhat I was used to in a monogamous relationship, in which seems kind of weird. But itturns out to be or has been very important for us to communicate everything like “Hey,I'm kind of being a little sexually left out. You've been with this other person like twoweeks, me and you haven't been together in a month” that type of thing. (Puffin, cisWhite pansexual man, upper-middle class)Puffin discussed that his realization of the importance of open communication helped himincrease his confidence in vocalizing his feelings and insecurities without the fear of hurting hispartners’ feelings. In addition, Puffin perceived a higher level of open communication inpolyamory than in monogamy, as he mentioned that “I would have never said that [feelingsexually left out] to my wife when it was just me and her, because she would definitely feel hurtand I think it could have built some resentment between the two of us.” In fact, manyparticipants echoed Puffin on an increased level of open communication with their partners afterentering their polyamorous journey.Furthermore, several participants shared their improved communication skills throughpolyamorous relationship experiences over time. For example,I've already mentioned how the strong communication piece of polyamory has definitelyinfluenced relationships at work and that sort of thing because it helps me see the world199in just such a different way. I feel like it helps me communicate with my children more,and I feel like it helps me communicate with them about being accepting of people'sdifferences. (Luna, cis White pansexual woman, 46, upper-middle class)Here, Luna reflected on the positive influence of polyamorous experiences on her improvedcommunication as a professional and a mother. She had become more comfortable with “callingout BS” at work and normalizing polyamory with her children (i.e., “not be embarrassed orashamed”) while cautioning them against potential discrimination (i.e., “persecute us”).Likewise, Lynna, Sylvia, and Rosa reflected on how their polyamorous journey facilitated theirgrowth in communicating with their partners on different topics.Lastly, some participants pointed out the benefit of communication to their polyamorousrelationships. It was common for these participants to experience an increased sense of trust andsecurity in their relationships. For example,A lot of her worries were about me liking her enough, or she was doing somethingwrong. And whenever we discuss these things, she wouldn't entirely believe me, becauseyou have to develop that trust how does she know that I really mean the things that I say.When I introduced her to be able to date someone else as well, I think it opened her doora little wider to trust me because it showed that I did mean what I said. It's like, “No, ifyou wanna date somebody else, if that helps meet your emotional needs, then that'sokay.” And I've been completely open and honest with her about attractiveness I feel forother people. It helped give more trust and weight to what I was saying to her. So that sheknew that when I said something to her, she could believe it. (Puffin, cis White pansexualman, upper-middle class)200Here, Puffin reflected on how his openness and honesty in communication proved histrustworthiness and reliableness to his current partner, which helped decrease her insecureattachment to develop more trust in him and their relationship. Similarly, Sylvia, Elijah, andRosa perceived a higher level of trust and security in their nesting or primary partnershipsbecause of continuous dyadic communication. For Glenn, open and honest communication alsohelped her dyad overcome the emotional pain from her partner’s infidelity at the early stage oftheir polyamorous explorations. It took a long time for us to work through that hurt. So then, you know, we left it[polyamory] alone again for a couple of years, and during that time, we communicated alot about what was wrong with that situation, and if there were to be a situation in thefuture how it would need to be. So we grew through all that, and it got us talking morein-depth and realistically about how to go about it better. (Glenn, cis White pansexualwoman, 43, middle class)For Glenn, pausing polyamory and communicating with her nesting partner helped rebuild thetrust between the dyad and reestablish approaches to develop polyamorous relationships. Inparallel, Rosa remembered constant communication with her nesting partners benefited the dyadin overcoming their past mistakes (e.g., prioritization of extradyadic relationships overmarriage). Clearly, all participants have engaged in building strengths and skills withinthemselves and their polycule to maintain their relationships. In the meantime, all of themdeveloped a support system in addition to their polycule to tackle various personal and relationalchallenges.Accessing Resources in a Support System201This sub-theme encompasses the importance of social support and the various resourcesparticipants accessed in their support system (e.g., family, friend circle, and community) toaddress challenges. For those participants who had disclosed their polyamorous relationship tofamily members, a few received care and support from family members for their polyamorousexperiences. For example,Like introducing [one partner] to my mom, my mother asks about him every time wetalk. She's like, “How's [one partner]? How's [the other partner]?” (Rachel)Here, Rachel mentioned the acceptance and care from her mother about her polyamorousrelationships. As quoted earlier, she had experienced a great sense of empathy and support fromher mother who was willing to self-educate on polyamory. Similarly, Peter and Cat also sharedtheir family’s acceptance of polyamorous relationships even without a clear understanding of thepolyamory concept. Specifically,What’s funny is then I mentioned I’m here spending the holiday with my partners. She[grandmother] was like, “I didn’t know.” I said with my girlfriend. My partners areboth… She [grandmother] was like, “I didn’t know you had girlfriends.” I said, “Yeah.You want to say hi to them?” They both said hi over the phone or whatever. She was like,“That’s nice.”... We visited her and everything. She’s just really happy to see me happy.(Cat, trans White pansexual woman, 32, lower class)Cat remembered the positive conversation during which her queer, trans, and polyamorousidentities were accepted by her grandmother. However, she also acknowledges that her familialacceptance (i.e., parents, grandmother) of non-normative identities was one privilege among herpolycule. In addition,202I actually have, we call her Mamala, my, our adopted Jewish mother, the woman that[nesting partner] met at a party, who lives in the gay district, has two sons, same age asus, but we live with her, and she's like my adopted mother. She knows all about it. Likeyou, you know, she is having dinners with a bunch of us, so we've never had to do thatcoming out. (Dominic, cis White gay man, 37, upper class)Choosing not to disclose their polyamorous relationships to their families of origin, Dominic andhis nesting partner received acceptance and support from their adopted mother. For many otherparticipants, selecting supportive non-family members was part of living with non-normativeidentities and polyamorous relationships. They reflected on the support from their friends fortheir polyamorous relationships. For example,My friends, absolutely. My best friend and her partner and her husband, and, like some ofmy closest friends, are again polyamorous. So it's like, “What is your experience beenwith this?” Like “What toxic situation have you been in?” “What have you seen before?”“Even if you haven't experienced it firsthand, I know you probably know somebody,monogamous or polyamorous, who’s gone through something similar. Can I glean fromyour experience?” “Can you offer me…” I'll get 1,000 different outside perspectives tohelp me be able to make me, advocate for my own self and my own relationship as wiselyas possible. (Rachel, cis White bi/pansexual woman, 39, working-middle class)Here, Rachel discussed various types of support she could access from her poly friend circles toaddress personal and relationship issues. Similarly, Rosa, Gabe, Dominic, Lynna, and Amydiscussed seeking different insights and shared that these perspectives had helped them analyzetheir relationship experiences. Specifically,203I mean, definitely my friend circle. I talk to my friends about my dating life a lot. What'scool is that I have queer friends and I have straight friends, and I have monogamousfriends, and I have poly friends. I kind of, I’m able to source multiple perspectives onsomething like that where, you know. \"As a straight monogamous person, how wouldyou feel about being approached in this way,\" or like things like that. I have a verydiverse friend group. I definitely use them as resources a lot to kind of talk through, likewhat am I not getting about this person's perspective or stuff like that. (Lynna, cis Asianbisexual woman, 28, middle class)For Lynna, having a friend circle with diverse backgrounds and experiences helped her gaindifferent perspectives to address relationship issues. In contrast, Amy discussed the support fromfriends with professional knowledge of relationships.Two of my very close friends are therapists. So I talk, talking to them about it. They havean education in being able to analyze that kind of thing, and even though I tell them, like“You don't have to be a therapist around me.” They can't help but share their opinions onthat kind of thing whenever it comes up. That can be nice, if I need that kind of advice,especially ‘cause one of them absolutely would be brutally honest with me. (Amy, cisWhite bisexual woman, 25, lower-middle class)Amy appreciated the relationship insights or advice from her therapist friends, which she couldapply to address her relationship issues. She remembered the conversation with one of herfriends that helped her identify the toxicity in the previous relationship with her ex-fiancé andbreak the engagement.204As aforementioned, many participants had remained friends with their ex-partners, andsome discussed seeking support from them to address their current relationship issues. Inparticular,The other one is the one that I was in a polyamorous relationship with. We just talk likenormal and feel comfortable talking about the other partners rather than not bringing itup. (Puffin, cis White pansexual man, upper-middle class)Here, Puffin pointed out a sense of comfort in sharing current polyamorous experiences withex-partners the same way as before relationship dissolution. While unable to access communityresources to benefit his polyamorous relationship maintenance, having support from previousand current polyamorous relationships helped him process personal and relational issues.A majority of participants discussed that accessing tangible and intangible resources inthe queer and/or polyamory community had provided them with strengths, skills, and resilienciesto tackle their challenges. For example, some participants shared that the utilization ofcommunity resources provided a sense of normalization, validation, and connectedness.Specifically,I mean part of the reason I wear this [heart infinity] bracelet is so that I can find otherpeople so that we can see each other and know that we're out here and we're not alone. Alot of people complain about the polyamory pride flag thing; they think it's ugly andweird and stupid. I love it ‘cause it's older than I am. How can I be so odd and ashamedand alone in this if someone 26 years ago got in his equivalent of MS Paint to make a flagabout it? I can't be. There's, we've been out here this whole time. (Amy, cis Whitebisexual woman, 25, lower-middle class)205Here, Amy described an increased sense of empowerment from polyamory symbols. For her,polyamory and bisexual symbols were self-validation and -motivation to live with love ratherthan in fear and shame. Similarly, Puffin and Amy also utilized social media to seeknormalization and validation of their polyamorous relationships. For many other participants, the polyamory community also provided a resource to seekeducation, information, and insights on polyamorous relationships. For example,I use the friends in that poly group mainly. And we have events once a month that we cango to or go to Reddit in case you have questions and address issues like that. And a lot ofthem are very open like, “Hey, I'm feeling jealous about this. My partner went out withsomeone and forgot that we had a date.” Or something like that. We talk about it openly,and it's uncomfortable, but it's worth it, and that's all what I’ve been doing. (Rosa, cisLatinx bisexual woman, 42, middle class)Here, Rosa pointed out that discussing polyamorous experiences with her poly group helped hernavigate polyamorous relationships. She remembered connecting with a local poly group whichallowed her to learn about the diversity in polyamorous relationships and identify those that fitherself and her marriage. In addition, she discussed engaging in poly-community activism hadreinforced her motivation to increase poly visibility through her own polyamorous relationships.Similarly,I think the support group has probably been the biggest because that's a place, they have,like monthly talk, so we can go there, and you know, even new people can ask questionsand stuff like that. So that's, that's been, I think, the biggest help. (Sylvia, cis Whitebi/pansexual woman, 46, middle class)206For Sylvia, her poly support was the biggest community resource for facilitating personal andrelational growth. There was a sense of privilege that she was able to receive support from herpoly support groups since the beginning of her polyamorous journey. She remembered variousmoments utilizing poly group workshops to improve her polyamorous relationships, such asclarifying relationship configurations with her nesting partner and improving communicationskills. Like Rosa, Sylvia also engaged in community activism (e.g., promoting poly visibility,normalizing polyamory).In fact, it was not uncommon that many participants both received support from and gaveback to the polyamorous community. As quoted earlier, Dominic also described how his polyfriends and counselor created a sense of community where they could share resources.And then today in therapy session, my therapist said, “Oh, I got this book recommendedto me by my client earlier today, and it was Polysecure.” And I was like “You can eitherconfirm or deny that the client that recommended it to you was probably called [friend]because that is my friend, who lives in the suburbs. I just started putting him to read that.”He was like “I can’t confirm nor deny if it was from [friend] who was..” So that isresilience, like that there is, there, that something that is kind of that network at the rightmoment. (Dominic, cis White gay man, 37, upper class)For Dominic, sharing books with his poly network demonstrate the effort in building communityresilience. He remembered moments when he scanned book chapters and sent them to hiscounselor. Helping his counselor stay educated on CNM and polyamory was his indirect supportfor more polyamorous individuals. Correspondingly,I also help maintain a community Discord server with a lot of people in the queercommunity. A lot of us are polyamorous, and a lot of overlap with different things. I have207certain skills and stuff that I try to use when I’m able to help people. I do a lot oftransportation for people. I’m always available to help people with mathematics if thatever happens. (Cat, trans White pansexual woman, 32, lower class)Here, Cat pointed out a sense of enjoyment from engaging with and supporting other people inher queer and polyamorous community. Focusing on the presence and community advocacyprovided her with resilience over her pessimism and uncertainty for the future queer community.In sum, while the size of support systems varies based on individual situations, it was universalthat all participants had the awareness and made efforts to create one to support them throughpersonal and relational challenges.ConclusionIn summary, 14 participants discussed their relationship experiences during theirpolyamorous journey. I used interpretive phenomenological analysis to examine transcripts andexplore the polyamorous relationship experiences of LGBP individuals. Based on analyzing theconvergence and divergence, five GETs were constructed to capture the meaning of participants’lived experiences in polyamorous relationships, including (1) polyamory is an evolving andpurposeful journey, (2) poly satisfaction is a systemic experience, (3) dynamic interplay of senseof self and interpersonal experiences, (4) interwoven personal, relational, and systemicchallenges, and (5) ecological systems for relationship maintenance. In Chapter Five, I willdiscuss interpretations of findings, implications for counseling, strengths, and limitations, as wellas directions for future research.208Chapter Five: DiscussionThe current study is the first known Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA; Smithet al., 2022) study that explores the polyamorous relationship experiences of lesbian, gay,bisexual, and pansexual individuals in the U.S. through the lens of minority stress and resilience(Brooks, 1981; Meyer, 2003; Meyer, 2015). The four research questions were designed toinvestigate specific phenomena in the polyamorous journey, including the establishment ofpolyamorous relationship structure, the influence of sexual orientation on relationshipexperiences, the influence of a sense of identity on relationship experiences, and responses torelationship challenges. Based on data analysis of 14 participants who met the inclusion criteria,five Group Experiential Themes with 16 corresponding sub-themes were constructed, including(1) polyamory is an evolving and purposeful journey, (2) poly satisfaction is a systemicexperience, (3) dynamic interplay of sense of self and interpersonal experiences, (4) interwovenpersonal, relational, and systemic challenges, and (5) ecological systems for relationshipmaintenance. Findings add valuable knowledge to the current limited understanding ofpolyamory and polyamorous relationship experiences. As such, this chapter includes theinterpretations of findings from a minority stress and resilience perspective, followed byimplications for counseling practice and counselor education. In addition, the strengths andlimitations of the current study will be identified. Lastly, suggestions for future research will bediscussed based on the findings of the current research.Interpretation of FindingsMinority Stress in PolyamoryIn the current study, polyamorous relationship experiences of LGBP individuals wereinvestigated under the framework of minority stress theory (Brooks, 1981; Meyer, 2003). The209model posits that individuals with a minoritized identity are subject to internal and externalstressors (in addition to normal everyday stressors) that can influence coping, social support, andhealth. Distal stressors (e.g., discrimination, violence) and proximal stressors (e.g., identityconcealment, rejection, internalized oppression) can create discrepancies in mental healthoutcomes that lead to disproportionate levels of mental health symptoms (e.g., depression,anxiety) among minoritized individuals (Meyer, 1995; Meyer, 2003). Yet, other factors,including salience, valence, and integration with one’s other identities can modify the effects ofminority stressors on one’s life. While polyamory-based minority stress was not quantified inthe study, participants discussed its existence in and influence on their relationship experience.Hetero/MononormativityThe minority stress model highlights the effect of norms within the environment onidentity development and stress associated with minority status (Meyer 2003). The effects ofhetero/mononormativity influenced each of the GET and sub-themes derived from participants inthe current study. Most notably, participants discussed the Interwoven, Personal, Relational, andSystemic Challenges (GET Four) associated with their polyamory experiences and tied many ofthese to the Hegemony across Cultures within a Normative Society. Participants describedvarious types of normativity in their lived experiences (across various social systems fromschool, work, home, and when accessing mental health support) with their intersectionalidentities (e.g., sexuality, gender, disability) and polyamorous relationships. For mostparticipants, the additive stressors were rooted in the mononormativity against their polyamorousrelationships. Lived experiences of anti-polyamory stigma, bias, and discrimination were evidentin the worlds of many participants in interaction with different social systems (e.g., family, friendcircle, neighborhood, legal and healthcare institutions). One possible explanation is the210marginalization of alternative relationship configurations due to the prevalence and dominationof hetero/mononormativity in the U.S. (Anderson, 2010; Conley et al., 2013a; Balzarini et al.,2018; Matsick et al., 2014. Moors et al., 2013). These stressors are consistent with findings ofexisting literature on the prevalence of negative attitudes toward polyamory (Conley et al.,2013a; Balzarini et al., 2018; Matsick et al., 2014. Moors et al., 2013). For example, severalparticipants discussed their polyamory was scapegoated as the cause of their relationshipproblems and challenges by their monogamous friends. One possible explanation for that biascan be polyamory being considered deviant and abnormal because of mononormativism (Conleyet al., 2013a; Balzarini et al., 2018; Matsick et al., 2014. Moors et al., 2013). The lack ofrecognition for polyamorous relationships by the U.S. legal system may also explain thestructural discrimination of polyamorous relationships in several participants’ experiences. It isnot uncommon that participants have experienced a certain level of anti-polyamory bias orstigma when interacting with their counselors. Their experiences seem to align with the findingsof Schechinger et al. (2018) that counselors display explicit or implicit anti-CNM bias andstigma characterized as harmful and stressful. As such, these participants have perceivedminimized benefits of counseling to support polyamorous relationships or changed theircounselors to avoid continuous harm.In addition, there seemed to be a gender difference with regard to participants’experiences of stigma and bias in polyamory based on participants’ experiences discussed underthe sub-theme Continuous Development of Intersectionality of GET Three Dynamic Interplay ofSense of Self and Interpersonal Experiences. Particularly, participants’ recollections suggest thatwomen in polyamory can be viewed as promiscuous and overly sexualized, whereas men inpolyamory can be seen as less masculine for letting their female partners date other men. It is211possible that the sexual double standards based on heteronormative tradition have contributed tosuch gender bias against women in polyamorous relationships (Rubin et al., 2014). Such anegative attitude toward men in polyamory may be rooted in the historically patriarchal beliefsand values that a man claims ownership of a woman through marriage.Concealment of Polyamorous RelationshipMeyer (2003) discussed identity concealment as part of the proximal stress process whichcan contribute to negative mental health consequences (e.g., depression) among sexuallyminoritized populations. In the current study, all participants discussed the Interwoven Personal,Relational, and Systemic Challenges (GET Four) due to the Dynamic Interplay of Sense of Selfand Interpersonal Experiences (GET Three) in a hetero/mononormative society. Manyparticipants reflected on how Managing Outness under Hetero/Mononormativity andInternalization of Adversity Strains Individual and Relational Well-Being. Almost all participantsmaintained a low level of polyamory outness, although the degree varies by participants and byspecific contexts. Specifically, participants are more likely to feel comfortable disclosing theirpolyamorous relationships and experiences in close friend circles, while concealing theirrelationships in other settings (i.e., family, work, neighborhood). There are perceived biases,stigma, and rejection associated with participants’ decision to concealment of polyamory.According to Meyer (2003), individuals with a sexually minoritized identity often choose toconceal such an identity in an effort to avoid discrimination. As such, it is highly possible thatthe naturalization and normalization of monogamy have led participants to conceal theirpolyamorous relationships to avoid potential biases, stigma, and rejection from family members,colleagues, and neighbors. In addition, many participants attributed religious beliefs (i.e.,Catholicism, Mormonism, Hinduism, Christianity) to the perceived rejection of polyamory from212their family members. Several authors have discussed the institutionalization of monogamy inthe U.S. through policy, religion, and social norms (Coontz, 2004; D’emilio & Freedman, 1997;Smith, 1993). More specifically, conservative religious beliefs predict the attitudes of social,cultural, and legal unacceptance of CNM and polyamory (Balzarini et al., 2018; Hutzler et al.,2016). Therefore, it is possible that lived experiences in a religious environment have contributedto the anticipated and perceived familial rejection of polyamory for participants. There was acommon phenomenon among participants that their level of sexual orientation outness (i.e., gay,bisexual, pansexual, demi-sexual) is higher than that of polyamory outness. Almost allparticipants discussed that disclosing polyamory was more challenging than disclosing theirsexual orientation. It is possible that social and political activism (e.g., legalized same-sexmarriage) has contributed to the decrease of explicit and implicit stigma and discriminationagainst non-heterosexuality in the U.S (Ofosu et al., 2019)., which led to participants’ highercomfort levels in disclosing sexual orientation. Another possible explanation for thisphenomenon is that participants may have a higher developmental level of sexual identity, whichincreases their self-image and confidence to disclose their sexual orientation.Many participants discussed the negative impact of polyamory concealment on theirpersonal and relational well-being (e.g., stress, depression, resentment of invisibility in public,low self-image as less brave). Specifically, participants reflected on labeling their partners asfriends, withdrawing from sharing relationship experiences, and avoiding appearing in social andfamily events with multiple partners simultaneously. Several participants also discussed theshame, embarrassment, and guilt associated with their polyamorous experiences and/or sexualorientation. According to Brooks Meyer (2003), identity concealment is part of the proximalstressor process, which is associated with disproportionate levels of mental health symptoms213(e.g., depression, anxiety) among sexually minoritized individuals (Meyer, 1995; Meyer, 2003).In addition, existing literature echoes that concealment of polyamory and CNM can contribute tothe internalization of heteronormativity or mononormativity and negative consequences (e.g.,lower well-being, lower relationship satisfaction, and mental health symptoms; Borgogna et al.,2021; Deri, 2015; Moors et al., 2021; Weitzman et al., 2009; Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). Inthe current study, a few participants discussed that either themselves, their partners, or theirmetamours had experienced shame, embarrassment, and guilt because of sexual orientation orpolyamorous relationships. Such negative emotions rooted in internalized heteronormativity andmononormativity negatively influenced their relationship experiences (e.g., emphasis onrelationship hierarchy, difficulty in communicating kinks or sexual preference, relationshipdissolution, see sub-theme Internalization of Adversity Strains Individual and RelationalWell-Being of GET Four Interwoven Personal, Relational, and Systemic Challenges). Therefore,the proximal stressor process (i.e., concealment of polyamory, internalizedhetero/mononormativity) may explain the personal and relational challenges participants haveexperienced as they navigate the world with multi-partners.Ignorance of Polyamory in SocietyAnother minority stress participants have discussed is based on the societal and scholarlyignorance of polyamorous relationships, which is one specific demonstration of the sub-themeHegemony across Cultures within a Normative Society within the GET Four InterwovenPersonal, Relational, and Systemic Challenges. In particular, many participants experiencedchallenges in describing their relationships and/or partners due to limited polyamorousterminology and language. Some other participants also encountered difficulties in assessingtheir relationship development (e.g., health, goals) in polyamory because of the scarcity of214polyamorous development models. It is also prevalent that most participants have gone through atrial-and-error phase during their polyamorous exploration because of limited models orresources for polyamorous relationship development. Specifically, many participants discussedmore challenges experienced in the early stage of their polyamorous journey, which suggests alower level of relationship satisfaction. Such a finding aligns with that of Flicker et al. (2021)that polyamorous relationships of less than five years reported a lower level of relationshipsatisfaction than those together more than five years. All the mentioned challenges may beexplained by the dearth of polyamorous discourse in our current society. For example, societalignorance of polyamory may have contributed to a lack of models, terminologies, and languages,which then lead to difficulties individuals experience as they start exploring polyamory.Until recently, most research on intimate relationships in the U.S. has primarily focusedon monogamous relationships (Conley et al., 2012b; Hazan et al., 2006; Schmookler & Bursik,2007). With an increased interest among the general public in CNM in the last two decades(Moors, 2017, Monroe, 2013; Oppenheimer, 2011; Reich, 2014), scientists and researchers wereslowly catching up to examine the prevalence of CNM, individuals’ interest in and practice ofCNM, and levels of social, cultural, and legal acceptance of CNM (e.g., Barker & Langdridge,2010; Haupert et al., 2017; Klesse 2005; Levine et al., 2018; Moors et al., 2013; Rubin et al.,2014). While these studies have provided valuable insights into the structures and dynamics ofvarious types of CNM relationships, the polyamorous relationship has been empiricallyunderstudied. Therefore, mononormativity may contribute to a lack of scholarly investigationand societal discourse, which has led to unique challenges in developing, maintaining, andmeasuring polyamorous relationships.Relationship Complexity Amplified Due to Multi-Partnership215Amplified relationship complexity is a unique minority stress participants haveexperienced due to the nature of a multi-partnership. Many participants discussed challenges intheir scheduling, balancing boundaries, and communications because of being in relationshipswith multiple partners simultaneously (see sub-theme Multi-Partnership Amplifies RelationalComplexity under GET Four Interwoven Personal, Relational, and Systemic Challenges). Thesechallenges may align with the common concern of power dynamics manifested in thedecision-making process of polyamorous relationship experiences (Weitzman et al., 2009;Wosick-Correa, 2010). Specifically, for participants in hierarchical polyamory, scheduling can bechallenging due to the prioritization of the primary partnership while maintaining additionalrelationships. As such, the complexity of ongoing communication, negotiation, and maintenanceof boundaries between their primary partnership and additional relationships can add morepersonal and relational stress (Bettinger, 2005; Veaux & Rickert, 2004). While participants innon-hierarchical polyamory may not experience such stress, balancing power dynamics to ensureequality and/or equity in a multi-partnership (e.g., shared decision-making in a closed triad,respecting relationship boundaries) may explain their experienced emotional exhaustion.Multiplied Stress Due to IntersectionalityParticipants with multiple marginalized identities have experienced different yet parallelminority stress in polyamory. For example, some participants discussed how Hegemony acrossCultures within a Normative Society has contributed to Interwoven Personal, Relational, andSystemic Challenges (GET Four). As participants continued to develop their view of their ownintersectionality, there was an interconnection between their sense of self and their relationshipexperiences (i.e., GET 3 Dynamic Interplay of Sense of Self and Interpersonal Experiences)Specifically, bisexual and pansexual participants experienced bi/pansexual negativity in their216polyamorous experiences (i.e., one pines policy, limiting metamour’s gender, sexuallyfantasizing bisexuality). There is historical prejudice against bisexual and pansexual individualsby heterosexual and lesbian/gay people due to promiscuity stereotypes and illegitimacy of sexualidentity (Barker et al., 2012; Brewster & Moradi, 2010; Klesse, 2005). Witherspoon et al., (2019)also suggested that the stigmatization of bisexuality and pansexuality can be exacerbated whenone bisexual or pansexual individual engages in CNM. Therefore, it is possible that suchprejudice penetrates into the polyamorous community which added more stress to bisexual andpansexual participants in their relationship experiences. In addition, participants with transgenderidentities and autism discussed exacerbated challenges in society (e.g., family, work, generalpublic) because of such intersectionality, even though the negative impact of suchintersectionality on their polyamorous relationships was minimized or manageable. There are noknown studies investigating the polyamorous or CNM experiences of individuals with a transidentity and disability. Nevertheless, the lasting stigma and discrimination against transgenderindividuals and persons with autism may have contributed to the exacerbated challengesexperienced by these participants.Furthermore, Gabe reflected on aggressions toward his racial identity in engaging inpolyamorous experiences with potential partners. His experience of racism in polyamory can beexplained by the perpetuating myth that polyamory is primarily practiced by White middle-classindividuals. In addition, racism in the queer community contributes to the exclusion,microaggression, and stigmatization experienced by LGBTQIA+ individuals who do not fit theEurocentric concept of queer identity (Le & Kler, 2022; Patel, 2019). As individuals withdifferent intersectional identities explore and develop their polyamorous relationships, they aresusceptible to multiple minority stress.217Moreover, a few participants experienced anti-polyamory stigma and bias in the queercommunity. Such anti-polyamory negativity (e.g., stealing good dating candidates, recruiting,greedy) is rooted in hegemonic mononormativity in the U.S. Historically, political conservativeshave connected CNM with their opposition to the legalization of same-sex marriage (Kurtz,2003; Lithwick, 2004). Specifically, Kurtz (2003) argued that the legitimacy of same-sexmarriage would also lead to legitimizing all forms of passion deemed immoral or illegal whileleaving society defenseless against an onslaught of unbounded desire. Perhaps fearing thatadvocating for CNM may jeopardize community efforts to fight for marriage equality, manyLGBTQIA+ activists in the past distanced themselves from polyamory advocacy (Klesse, 2018).Therefore, despite the fact that queer individuals are more likely to endorse and engage in CNM(Balzarini et al., 2019; Haupert et al., 2017; Moor et al., 2014), institutionalization andnormalization of monogamy have led to the internalized mononormativity within the queercommunity, which contributed to the anti-poly stigma and bias experienced by some participantsin the current study.Minority Resilience in PolyamoryResilience refers to the “process or phenomenon of competence despite adversity”(Luthar et al., 2000, p. 554). In the minority stress model, resilience includes coping and socialsupport that address relevant stress associated with minoritized identities (Meyer, 2003; 2015).Resilience is an essential part of the minority stress process given that it only has meaning whenone encounters distal and/or proximal stressors (Meyer, 2015). Some authors have suggested thata minoritized identity can be a source of strength to attenuate stress and that minoritizedcommunity can be a support system accessed to overcome life challenges and obstacles (Hobfollet al, 2002; Meyer, 2015). In the current study, participants have managed to build an ecological218system that allows them to gain strength and resilience in navigating their polyamorousrelationship in a hetero/mononormative society.Personal ResilienceParticipants discussed varying areas of satisfaction in their polyamorous relationships andtheir ongoing journey in polyamorous explorations, which seem to echo the findings ofWitherspoon and Theodore (2021) that nonheterosexual or CNM individuals may havedeveloped resilience to withstand and even thrive in the face of social stigma and discrimination.In fact, a majority of participants reflected on varying strategies to develop strengths, resources,and resilience to achieve personal and relational growth in polyamory. Specifically, manyparticipants discussed seeking wisdom from online resources and literature to gain a deeperunderstanding of themselves and polyamory during the Continuous Improvement in PolyamorousRelationship (GET One Polyamory Is an Evolving and Purposeful Journey). In addition, underthe sub-theme On-Going Personal Work for Growth of GET Five Ecological Systems forRelationship Maintenance, some participants discussed how they managed to develop criticalconsciousness by deconstructing internalized oppressive ideologies (i.e.,hetero/mononormativity, imperialism, capitalism) and reconstructing their personal and relationalphilosophies. A few also discussed the benefits of counseling in managing personal andrelational difficulties. It is worth noting that only one study has empirically investigated thebuffering effects of resilience against the negative effects of anti-CNM stigma and discrimination(Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021). The positive effects of developing cognitive flexibility amongparticipants in the current study contradict the findings of Witherspoon and Theodore (2021) thatsuggest greater cognitive flexibility may lead to increased anticipation of stigma anddiscrimination which in turn exacerbates stress. Moreover, the development of personal skills219(e.g., self-reflection, coping skills) and positive mindsets (e.g., a growth mindset, pride inauthentic living) among participants seem to confirm the hypothesis that CNM individuals mayutilize these methods to cope with the challenges of creating and sustaining multi-partneredrelationships (Labriola, 2010; Sheff, 2014).Some scholars have argued that layers of cultural identity might be sources of resilienceagainst the negative effects of stigma-related stressors (Balsam & Mohr, 2007; Figueroa &Zoccola, 2015; Hill & Gunderson, 2015). Such theory is partially attested by participants’experiences under the GET Three Dynamic Interplay of Sense of Self and InterpersonalExperiences. The strong association with polyamory as their preferred relationship configurationmay be a source to develop resilience against the negative effects of stigma-related stressors,even though there is no agreement among participants on polyamory as an identity. It is possiblethat these participants have developed resilience to mitigate the impact of the negative effects ofanti-polyamory sigma and bias on their personal and relational experiences (Sheff, 2016).However, further research is warranted to explore the influence of resilience building onpolyamorous relationship experiences.Finally, participants discussed how their Current Polyamorous Structure Reflects theirRelational Philosophy in GET One Polyamory Is an Evolving and Purposeful Journey. Scholarshave engaged in philosophical discourse for how to best conceptualize polyamory (e.g.,relationship orientation, identity; Anapol, 2010; Barker, 2005, Emens, 2004; Klesse, 2007;Klesse, 2014). As aforementioned, many participants in the current study did not describepolyamory as part of their identity. However, all participants reported experiencing a sense ofcompatibility and congruence between their self-perception and identity (i.e., sexuality,personality traits, gender identity) with polyamory. Most participants discussed how their220openness to different possibilities led them to depart from monogamy and prefer polyamory overother types of CNM relationships. As participants developed their polyamorous relationships,many also deconstructed internalized relationship beliefs and values rooted inhetero/mononormativity. Several participants mentioned a liberatory mindset awakened duringtheir exploration journey that affirmed a sense of self and relationship values such as equality,openness, and the potential of human connection. Therefore, it is possible that participantsdeveloped their own relationship philosophy during polyamorous explorations rather thanascribing to scripts associated with hetero/mononormativity. In turn, this polyamorousrelationship exploration motivated and enabled them to create a relationship structure thatreflects such relationship philosophy.Relational ResilienceAll participants have discussed the benefits of collaboration with their partners andmetamours to address their personal and relational challenges. Specifically, many participantsemphasized the interconnectedness between increased trust, commitment, as well as security andimproved communication with their partners (See sub-themes Togetherness in AddressingChallenges and Cruciality of Communication under GET Five Ecological Systems forRelationship Maintenance). Jealousy is present in many participants’ experiences inpolyamorous relationships, which aligns with findings of existing literature (e.g., Deri, 2015;Heaney, 2011). However, relational efforts (e.g., open and honest communication, quality timetogether, reassurance of commitment) have led to a reduced level of jealousy over time. Inaddition, communication with partners on relationship expectations and coordinating,scheduling, and balancing relationship activities has improved mutual understanding inpolyamorous experiences. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that open221communication on jealousy may have led to greater awareness of oneself as well as others and arise in compersion (Deri, 2015; Veaus & Rickert, 2014). Moreover, relational resilience alsomanifested itself in GET Two Poly Satisfaction is a Systemic Experience. For example,participants discussed how they had diversified their needs across partners, which led to highlevels of satisfaction in different areas of their relationships (see sub-theme Multi-PartnershipSatisfies Needs and Wants in Different Ways). Under the sub-theme Polycule SatisfactionEnhances Connectedness, a few participants mentioned the communal and tribe perspective ashaving their partner’s needs met by other partners or metamours had reduced their relationalanxiety and distress. It is possible that participants see their polycule as a community and theirhigh levels of relationship satisfaction derived from accessing different resources to meetpersonal and relational needs help build the community resilience to buffer varying types ofchallenges (Meyer, 2015).In addition, under the subtheme Accessing Resources in a Support System of GET FiveEcological Systems for Relationship Maintenance, some participants reflected on the networkwith previous partners and metamours. A few of them discussed socialization with metamourshas facilitated developing positive attitudes toward their partner’s polyamorous relationships andreceiving emotional and logistical support. While there are known studies on the role ofmetamours in polyamorous relationship experiences, it seems that building a positiverelationship with metamours can be considered a part of relational resilience building inpolyamory. Some participants also maintained a positive relationship with their partners fromdissolved polyamorous relationships. It is possible that maintaining positive connections withex-partners despite the change in relationship nature is a unique part of relational resilience in222polyamory (Sheff, 2016). In summary, participants in the current study have utilized relationalresources within their polycule or poly network to build resilience in the face of adversities.Furthermore, participants’ experiences suggest their resilience in the face of thechallenges in exploring and developing polyamorous relationship structures due to societalignorance of polyamory. Under the GET One Polyamory Is an Evolving and Purposeful Journey,almost all participants discussed constant reflection, discussion, and negotiation that facilitatedcontinuous adjustment and exploration intra- and interpersonally. The journey and evolvingprocess of finding how polyamory worked for them helped to consolidate their currentrelationship structure in a manner that fulfilled the needs of themselves and their partners.According to Meyer (2015), resilience can be anything that facilitates positive adaptation thatmitigates the negative impact of minority stress. As such, participants in the current study mayhave relied on relational efforts to continuously assess and adapt their relationships to meetchanging needs and expectations, thus reducing the negative influence of different challenges onpersonal and relationship health.Community ResilienceIndividual- and relational-based resilience bears an important value in managing minoritystress and strengthening personal and relational well-being in polyamory. Meanwhile, thesub-theme Accessing Resources in a Support System under GET Five Ecological Systems forRelationship Maintenance demonstrates the positive influences of community resources onparticipants’ personal and relational well-being. In particular, many participants discussed thecrucial benefits of accessing resources in the queer and/or polyamory community. For example,some participants discussed the support from local polyamorous groups and communities thatassisted them in the exploratory and maintenance stage of polyamorous relationships (e.g.,223identifying polyamorous models, improving communication, seeking relationship advice,normalizing polyamorous inclinations). Amy also pointed out the special meaning of queer andpolyamorous symbols (i.e., bi pride flag, poly pride flag, heart infinity bracelet) in validating andempowering her sexual identity and polyamorous relationships. In addition, several participantsdeveloped resilience in an increased sense of empowerment and togetherness through advocacywith the queer and/or polyamorous community (e.g., promoting visibility, sharing resources).While no study has examined the benefit of community-based resilience in polyamorousrelationship experiences, it is suggested that tangible and intangible resources within acommunity can provide opportunities for social and legal support and for the reframing of socialvalues and norms (Crocker & Major, 1989; Meyer, 2015). As such, it is possible that byaccessing and utilizing various community resources, these participants manage to develop astronger sense of self, strengths, skills, and resilience to maintain their personal and relationalwell-being in spite of hetero/mononormativity. As the benefits of community-based resiliencedepend on the capacity that communities have to further help individuals to develop andmaintain well-being (Hall & Zautra, 2010), it is crucial that continuous effort is to be made tosolidify the queer and polyamorous communities and ensure equitable access to communityresources among its members.Implications for CounselingCounselors may apply the results of the current study in several ways. First, connectionsbetween experiences shared by participants and the ethical and multicultural practice ofcounseling will be discussed. Next, multicultural considerations for case conceptualization andtreatment planning will be identified, with an emphasis on the minority stress theory as aframework for assessment. Furthermore, professional learning and continuing education need to224advance poly-affirmative counseling will be discussed. Finally, applications of findings torelationship counseling will be identified, although tentative given that this current studyinteracted with individuals only.Ethical Considerations in PracticeThe findings of the current study have several significant ethical implications forcounseling practices on diversity, inclusion, and social justice. For counselors, it is crucial tounderstand the diversity in relationship configurations. Counselors must avoid assuming clients’relationship status or relationship inclinations based on hetero/mononormative beliefs and values(American Counseling Association, ACA, 2014). For example, using more inclusive languagewhen inquiring about clients’ relationship backgrounds can create a safe and non-judgmentalspace for polyamorous clients to disclose their partners and their relationship experiences(Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020; Schechinger et al., 2018). It is also important that counselors minimizeor avoid hetero/mononormative language (e.g., couple) when providing counseling services topolyamorous clients. Similarly, a discourse within the counseling field is warranted with regardto reframing certain professional titles (e.g., couple’s counseling, marriage counseling) to includedifferent relationship configurations. In addition, participants of the current study come fromdiverse backgrounds and experiences. Therefore, counselors need to understand the diversity andintersectionality (e.g., sexuality, gender, race, ability, religion/spirituality) in polyamory, insteadof perpetuating the myth of polyamory being exclusive to White middle-class populations (ACA,2014; Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020; Ratts et al., 2015). Moreover, the diversity lies in the varyingpathways (e.g., establishing a polyamorous relationship since the beginning, openingmonogamy) to and structures of polyamory (e,g., hierarchical, non-hierarchical, closed system,open system). For instance, the relationship experiences of a closed non-hierarchical triad can225differ from those of hierarchical relationships. As such, counselors must avoid assuming allpolyamorous relationships are the same but approach the relationship experiences ofpolyamorous clients with an open mind and cultural curiosity (Ratts et al., 2015).Moreover, counselors working with polyamorous clients must be aware of two otherimperative ethical considerations (ACA, 2014). In particular, confidentiality and boundaries canbe complicated when working with a polycule simultaneously. For counselors working withindividual polyamorous clients who are in the same polyamorous network or friend group,maintaining clients’ confidentiality and boundaries can be especially challenging. Therefore, it iscrucial that counselors follow ethical guidelines to avoid breaking confidentiality and boundarieswith an understanding of the unique cultures of polyamory (ACA, 2014).Case ConceptualizationMeanwhile, rather than pathologizing polyamory when conceptualizing presentingconcerns, counselors must understand the minority stressors individuals in polyamorousrelationships experience because of hetero/mononormativity (Brooks, 1981; Meyer, 2003;Schechinger et al., 2018). Due to a lack of polyamorous relationship models, polyamorousclients may experience different challenges at different stages of their relationships (e.g.,transitional stage, exploring stage, developing stage, stable stage; Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020).Specifically, a dyad planning to open a monogamous marriage may face different challenges thana dyad thinking about changing the current hierarchical relationship structure to anon-hierarchical one. Therefore, it is imperative that counselors understand the relationshipdevelopmental stage of their polyamorous clients to develop treatment goals and plans.Additionally, polyamorous clients face hetero/mononormative stigma, bias, and discrimination atdifferent levels ( Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020). Therefore, many experience challenges disclosing226their polyamorous relationships and navigating social systems with their partners, which in turnnegatively influence their personal and relational well-being. The current study also echoes theresults from Moor et al., (2020) that internalized hetero/mononormativity negatively impactsrelational attitudes and behaviors which then negatively influences relationship experiences. Forpolyamorous clients who have multiple marginalized identities (e.g., sexuality, gender, people ofcolor, disability), their intersectional experiences may differ from those of Cis Whiteheterosexual abled polyamorous clients (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020). Thus, during caseconceptualization, counselors must explore the varying and unique challenges polyamorousclients face while developing and/or maintaining their multi-partnered relationships.Moreover, the nature of a multi-partnered relationship can add more complexity torelationship development and maintenance (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020). For example,communication, balanced scheduling, relational dynamics, and relationship dissolution inpolyamorous relationships depart from mononormativity and can drastically differ depending onthe polyamorous relationship structure and the polyamorous relationship developmental stages.As a result, counselors must contextualize clients’ relationships to provide targeted care andsupport benefiting their navigation of polyamorous relationships (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020). Forexample, counselors may help a newly polyamorous triad to improve their communication skillsto openly and honestly discuss their feelings and thoughts without blaming, whereas for aseasoned polyamorous dyad struggling with current relationship agreements, counselors canassist them in renegotiating them based on their changing needs and expectations. Relationshipdissolution in polyamory can be complicated. For example, many polyamorous individualsgrieve the loss of a romantic relationship while also considering it as a transition to anotherrelationship. Counselors must approach such a relationship issue based on clients’ specific227situations and needs while avoiding imposing hetero/mononormativity. Furthermore, counselorsmay advocate for and with their polyamorous clients on social justice issues (e.g., inequitable ordiscriminatory policies against polyamory and non-monogamy)Poly Affirmative CounselingCounselors can develop poly affirmative counseling approaches to more effectively workwith polyamorous clients. At the beginning of the counseling process, counselors adapt elementsof structural therapy to explore the boundaries and dynamics between different sub-systemswithin the polycule (Gebel et al., 2023). The findings of the current study suggest thatparticipants faced complications in the development of boundaries and interpersonal dynamicswithin a polycule. Therefore, an exercise such as an adapted eco-map and/or genogram may behelpful to visualize connections between partners and metamours in polyamorous relationshipsor poly networks. For example, counselors may ask “How would you describe your relationshipstructure” and “How does your relationship structure influence engagement with individuals inthe polycule” to guide polyamorous clients in the relational mapping process. It is crucial thatcounselors adopt clients’ language with regard to labels for relationships and specific individualsin the polycule, rather than imposing hetero/mononormative language or assumptions. Ascounselors collaborate with polyamorous clients on mapping out relationship structures anddynamics, they can gain a clearer understanding of the context for presenting concerns.Schechinger et al. (2018) suggested that counselors approach polyamorous clients with anaffirming mindset. For example, validating clients’ polyamorous identity, inclination, or lifestyle(depending on clients’ language) can strengthen the therapeutic relationship and increase aclient’s comfort level for sharing about relationships and experiences during treatment. Inaddition, rather than overfocusing on their polyamorous relationships, counselors need to listen228effectively and ask relevant questions to gain a clear understanding of polyamorous clients’presenting concerns and needs from counseling services (Schechinger et al., 2018;Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020). Poly affirmative counselors must avoid scapegoating or blamingpolyamory for clients’ relationship problems or challenges; instead, exploration of polyamorousclients’ experiences needs to be conducted without judgment and pathologization in order toidentify the sources of challenges in their relationships (e.g., personal level, relational level,systemic level; Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020). For example, practice-based evidence suggests thatattachment injuries and traumas can contribute to personal and relational challenges inpolyamory (Fern, 2020). Likewise, several participants in the current study mentioned the needfor ‘personal work’ and healing from past trauma as an integral step in their journey topolyamory that can enhance relationship quality. Thus, examining attachment styles amongpartners may facilitate a growing awareness of attachment, trauma, and current relationshipbehaviors, which leads to attachment-based healing and an increased sense of safety and securityin polyamorous relationships (Fern, 2020). The influence of past trauma or attachment torelationship quality is not unique to poly relationships; however, participant statements about themanagement of jealousy as an ongoing process reflect a potential unique influence observable inpoly relationships. So, poly affirmative counselors may support the process of assessing theinfluence of attachment and trauma for relational experiences associated with jealousy,compersion, and managing boundaries and logistics with partners.All participants in the current study suggested communication is crucial to ensure afunctional polyamory. According to their experiences, many discussed that challenging topics incommunication include sex-related topics, jealousy, and negative emotions. As such, polyaffirmative counselors must acknowledge the complexity of communication in polyamorous229relationships and assess polyamorous clients’ communication skills. Depending on the stages ofpolyamorous clients’ relationship development, counselors can utilize interventions (e.g.,coaching, psychoeducation, role-play) to empower the clients to develop confidence and improvetheir communication skills characterized by openness, transparency, and honesty. Counselors canalso provide communication skills training (e.g., active listening, managing conflict, sharedproblem-solving) for polyamorous partners in relationship counseling so that polyamorousclients can express their feelings and emotions without blaming. For example, opencommunication on jealousy may lead to greater awareness of oneself as well as others and a risein compersion (Deri, 2015; Veaus & Rickert, 2014). Counselors can normalize jealousy inrelationship experiences and assist polyamorous clients in communicating the source of jealousyand generating personal and/or relational solutions to minimize its negative impact onrelationships.In addition, it is imperative that counselors develop a strength-based mindset whencollaborating with their polyamorous clients in the counseling process (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020).For example, polyamory can provide many benefits for individuals, such as improvedcommunication, diversified needs across partners, multiplied sources for support, and authenticbeing. Therefore, counselors can work with polyamorous clients to identify the strengths andskills developed in their multi-partnered relationships to tackle current personal and relationalissues (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020; Schechinger et al., 2018). In addition, counselors can assistpolyamorous clients in building a support system (e.g., family, friends, community) to accessmore tangible and intangible resources (Meyer, 2015). Counselors can apply the minority stressmodel by empowering and enhancing resources (internal and external) for coping and mentalhealth.230In order to develop poly affirmative counseling, it is crucial that counselors take thenecessary steps to address their explicit and implicit biases and stigmas against polyamory basedon hetero/mononormativity (Schechinger et al., 2018). For example, continuing education (e.g.,literature, seminars, continuing education workshops) can be valuable to challenge one’shetero/mononormative beliefs and values, reflect on one’s positionality with polyamorousclients, and develop poly-affirmative counseling approaches. In addition, poly-affirmativecounseling manifests itself through counselors’ knowledge of polyamory concepts andterminologies (Schechinger et al., 2018). Therefore, counselors need to become knowledgeableabout polyamory and its diverse relationship structures and experiences to avoid a monolithicand hegemonic understanding of polyamory. Developing awareness and knowledge ofintersectionality can benefit counselors in affirming and validating polyamorous clients’intersectional experiences within and outside their multi-partnered relationships.Counselor Education and PreparationIn order to train counselors with multicultural and social justice counseling competencies(Ratts et al., 2015) to work with polyamorous clients, counselor education programs can take thefollowing steps. It is imperative that counselor educators acknowledge the perpetuation ofhetero/mononormativity in the counseling profession and counselor education pedagogy(Graham, 2014; Schechinger et al., 2018; Weitzman et al., 2009; Zimmerman, 2012). Counseloreducation programs need to reflect on the implications of the terms “couple,” “marriage,” as wellas “family” in educational and clinical settings and adopt more inclusive and equitable languagesthat reflect the diversity of relationship and family structure. For example, replacing course titles,such as “couple’s counseling” “marriage counseling,” or “family counseling,” with “relationshipcounseling” can demonstrate a departure from hetero/mononormative standards on relationship231formation, development, and health. In addition, counselor educators can add diversity to humansexuality and relationship education in the curriculum (Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2020). For example,selecting reading materials (e.g., textbooks, articles) with inclusive language to sexuality, gender,and relationships can assist counseling students in developing multicultural awareness andknowledge. Integrating polyamory into sexuality and relationship education can also helpstudents confront their internalized hetero/mononormativity and develop a fluid and criticalmindset to relationship structures and experiences.It is also crucial for counselor educators to avoid perpetuating hegemonic beliefs andvalues when educating counseling students on human sexuality and polyamory. Specifically,counselor educators need to address within-group diversity because of the intersectionalidentities and experiences of individuals. As such counselor educators can design researchstudies to examine polyamory through an intersectional lens to gain a deeper understanding ofconvergence and divergence in relationship structures and relationships (Pallotta-Chiarolli,2020). In summary, it is imperative that counselors and counselor educators continue tostrengthen their competencies to provide ethical and affirmative care to polyamorous clients. Insum, counselors need to seek continuing education to develop their counseling competencies inworking with polyamorous clients.Directions for Future ResearchThe current study sheds light on the meanings of LGBP individuals have made out oftheir polyamorous relationship experiences. Therefore, the findings provide several directions forfuture research studies. First, participants in the current study used different terms (e.g., identity,lifestyle, or relationship orientation) to reflect the meaning of polyamory. Thus, future researchcan focus on the philosophical aspect of polyamory by exploring how people in polyamorous232relationships define the meaning of polyamory. A clearer understanding of the polyamoryconcept can add invaluable contributions to future research designs on polyamorousrelationships. In addition, more individuals identified as bisexual and/or pansexual, whichseemed to be consistent with the findings of Haupert et al. (2017). Some participants discussedspecific biases and discriminations targeting their bi/pansexuality in polyamorous experiences.Therefore, future research can investigate how bi/pansexual individuals make meanings based onthe relationship between sexuality and polyamory. As such, there is also a necessity to explorethe polyamorous relationship experiences of individuals with a specific identity to develop adeeper understanding of the convergence and divergence within a relatively homogenous group.Since three participants in the current study also discussed how their ability status (i.e.,neurodivergence) influences their interpersonal relationships, future research can explore thepolyamorous relationship experiences of individuals with a disability. Moreover, participants inthe current study came from different states in the U.S., which has influenced their access tosocial and community resources. Therefore, future research can focus on polyamorousrelationship experiences in a particular geographic location to investigate relevant relationshipchallenges and resiliencies for multicultural and social justice advocacy.Meanwhile, participants in the current study discussed the creation of their polyamorousrelationship structure and their relationship experiences under such a structure. Given the natureof a multi-partnered relationship, future research design can utilize group interviews to gainmultiple perspectives of polyamorous relationship experiences from different partnerssimultaneously. Since there is diversity in polyamorous relationship structures, future researchcan investigate relationship development and maintenance under a specific polyamorousstructure. For example, exploring a closed triadic system can provide more insights into the233relationship dynamics among three partners and their interactions with the outside world.Moreover, the current research includes participants at different stages of their polyamorousrelationship development. The findings suggest pronounced challenges at the early stage ofpolyamorous relationships and a higher level of relationship satisfaction as the relationshipprogresses over time, which is consistent with findings in existing literature (i.e., Flicker et al.,2021). Therefore, future research can investigate the association between relationship length andrelationship experiences, which can provide more insights into counseling practice to supportpolyamorous clients. A longitudinal study can also be especially valuable to create polyamorousrelationship development models that benefit not only counselors but also individuals inpolyamorous relationships in examining their relationship growth and health. Moreover, giventhe paucity of research studies (e.g., Witherspoon & Theodore, 2021) on resilience as a bufferingfactor to mitigate minority stress in polyamorous relationships, it is crucial that future researchexplores how individuals develop resilience to manage various challenges in their relationshipmaintenance.Furthermore, participants discussed the varying attitudes of their counselors towardpolyamory and CNM. Future research can focus on examining factors that contribute tocounselors’ attitudes toward and approaches to consensually non-monogamous relationshipconfigurations. It is imperative to understand counselors’ barriers to developing multicultural andsocial justice counseling competencies in polyamory in order to develop relevant counselingtraining programsLimitationsThe current study is the first qualitative study to our knowledge that specifically exploresthe polyamorous relationship experiences of LGBP individuals. However, the current study is no234exception to limitations. Due to the nature of an IPA study, the findings based on a small sampleof LGBP individuals in polyamorous relationships are not generalizable to reflect universalpolyamorous relationship experiences, and neither the goal of this current study is to reach such ageneralization. Second, there are also limitations in the inclusion criteria of the current study.Specifically, LGBP individuals who have experienced dissolved polyamorous relationships anddeparted from polyamory were excluded from participation. Therefore, it is possible thatparticipants in the current study discuss more satisfaction with their polyamorous relationshipexperiences, which may yield biased findings. Furthermore, there are limitations to the findingsof the current study due to the recruitment strategy. Specifically, most of the participants wererecruited through LGBTQIA+ organizations (e.g., SAIGE) and polyamory organizations (e.g.,Polyamory Virginia). Access to or affiliation with LGBTIA+ and polyamory organizations mayexplain a high representation of counseling practitioners in the participants as well asparticipants' high levels of knowledge of polyamory concepts and terminologies (e.g., unicorn,compersion), utilization of community resources for resilience, and engagement in communityadvocacy. Most of the participants had at least a bachelor’s degree and identified their SES asmiddle class or above, which also may have influenced access to and utilization of resources tomaintain their polyamorous relationships. Therefore, these findings yielded based on therecruitment strategy have potential bias and may not be representative of the generalpolyamorous population. Meanwhile, all of the interviews were conducted at the individual levelfor convenience, safety, and privacy concerns. However, such an interview procedure onlycaptures one party’s perception of their relationship experiences while leaving out space fordifferent perspectives and voices emerging from all partners involved in polyamorousrelationships. Regardless of these limitations, the findings add valuable contributions to the235current limited knowledge of polyamorous relationships and experiences (e.g., relationshipdevelopment, relationship maintenance, minority stress, resilience) within the sexuallyminoritized community. A significant strength of the current study is its qualitative nature whichallows participants to discuss the nuances of defining their partnerships. In addition, the currentstudy partially examines the influence of intersectional identities on polyamorous relationships,which avoids perpetuating a hegemonic understanding of polyamory and polyamorousrelationships. Lastly, as mentioned in the previous two sections, the findings stress the diversityof polyamory which provides insights into counseling practices, counselor education, and futureresearch.ConclusionThe current study explores the polyamorous relationship experiences of LGBPindividuals. Specifically, utilizing IPA (Smith et al., 2022), the study is designed under aminority stress theory framework (Brooks, 1981, Meyer, 2003; Meyer, 2015) to investigate themeanings made out of the polyamorous relationship journey, the relationship between sense ofintersectional identities and polyamorous experiences, and resilience to varying challenges. Thefive GETs reflect the convergence and divergence of participants’ experiences in theirpolyamorous relationships, including (1) polyamory is an evolving and purposeful journey, (2)poly satisfaction is a systemic experience, (3) dynamic interplay of sense of self andinterpersonal experiences, (4) interwoven personal, relational, and systemic challenges, and (5)ecological systems for relationship maintenance. As the first known qualitative study thatinvestigates polyamorous relationships within the sexually minoritized community, the GETsprovide valuable contributions to the current limited knowledge of polyamory, which can be used236for future training for counselors to advance their multicultural and social justice counselingcompetence and poly-affirmative counseling approaches to working with polyamorous clients.237ReferencesAguilar, J.

    "abstract": "Polyamory is a type of relationship under the consensual non-monogamy relationship umbrella that assumes the possibility, validity, and worthwhileness of maintaining romantic, sexual, and intimate relationships with multiple people simultaneously. In Western society, the prevalence and domination of mononormativity have led to the marginalization of relationships alternative to monogamy (i.e., polyamory). As a result, individuals in polyamorous relationships continue to experience bias, stigma, and discrimination at varying levels. With a rise in public interest in CNM in the past two decades, scientists and researchers have slowly started to examine various topics related to CNM, including its prevalence, public attitudes toward CNM, and CNM relationship quality. However, empirical research designated to investigate polyamorous relationships is lacking, let alone polyamorous relationships of sexually minoritized populations. Therefore, the current qualitative study investigates the polyamorous relationship experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals. Utilizing Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, the current study explored the minority stress and resilience of polyamorous relationship experiences of 14 participants. Five group experiential themes were constructed based on the convergence of participants’ experiences, including (1) polyamory is an evolving and purposeful journey, (2) poly satisfaction is a systemic experience, (3) dynamic interplay of sense of self and interpersonal experiences, (4) interwoven personal, relational, and systemic challenges, and (5) ecological systems for relationship maintenance. Overall, participants utilized personal, relational, and community resources to build strengths, skills, and resilience to address challenges that come within and outside of their polyamorous relationships. Implications for counseling practice, counselor education, and recommendations for future research are discussed, with a focus on developing multicultural and social justice counseling competencies for counselors to work with clients in polyamorous relationships",
