Through \ncumulative attrition, key interactions and encounters at each stage influence non-\nprogression to the next. Using asexuality as an example, we identify three main \ntrajectory stages of non-awareness, communicative negation and non-consolidation, \neach involving interactional contingencies. With a wider applicability to other \nrepudiated identities, this model shows how even negational symbolic social objects \n(non-issues, non-events and non-identities) are constituted through social interaction. \n \nKeywords: asexuality, identity, non-becoming, career trajectory \n \nIntroduction \n \nSometimes research takes us in unexpected directions. What had seemed the obvious \napproach leads to a dead end, while an apparently blind alley opens out into a \nbeautiful new landscape. Serendipitous findings can be the most interesting, so there \nis value in disobedience to scholarly conventionality (Åkerström 2013). The project \non which this article reports was designed to be a study of asexual identities and \nstories of becoming. However, we also discovered, amongst a subset of participants, \naccounts of non-identification and non-becoming, whereby they recognised, engaged \nwith, communicated and managed the term ‘asexual’, but ultimately rejected it as a \ncentral basis of identity. This was narrated as a journey, unfolding over the life course \nand mediated by social interaction. Key events, relationships and memorable \nencounters served as contingent factors that led actors away from rather than towards \nan asexual identity. Stories of non-becoming reflect a mirror image of the stories of \nbecoming conventionally recognised within Symbolic Interactionism. They share \nsimilar features but in reverse: distorted, refracted and leading back towards \nuncertainty. This article examines stories of not becoming asexual, but the same \nprinciples could apply to other cases of unrealised, unwanted or unsuccessfully \nclaimed social identities. \n \n \nContextual background \n \nBecoming asexual \n \nAsexuality, defined as a low or absent level of sexual desire and/or attraction (Bogaert \n2012) is a meta-category encompassing a diverse range of orientations towards sex, \nattraction, romance and gender (Carrigan 2011). Recently brought into the \nsociological domain, it has immediate relevance to questions of identity. \nPoststructuralist theorists view asexuality as a subversive challenge to the dominant \ndiscourses of ‘sexu-society’ (Przybylo 2011). Micro-politics of intimate citizenship \n(Plummer 2003) play out in online communities, where members mobilise a complex \nlexicon of subcategorical labels, such as grey-A, demi-, homo-, hetero- or bi-romantic \nor aromantic. Recently, there has been a turn towards qualitative studies of asexual \npeople’s lived experiences (Scherrer 2008). Carrigan (2011) outlines a sequence of \nstages of private self-reflection, through which individuals arrive at an asexual \nidentity: feelings of difference, self-questioning, assumed pathology, self-\nclarification, biographical narration, and communal identity. However, such models \nstill neglect the social interaction context in which these meanings are negotiated. \nTaking a Symbolic Interactionist approach, our study aimed to explore this missing \ndimension, through stories of micro-socially ‘becoming’ asexual.  \n \n \nBecoming ourselves \n \nSymbolic Interactionism understands identity as a social process that unfolds over the \nlife course. The concept of the career trajectory, theorised by Goffman (1961a), \nBecker (1963) and Strauss (1969), points to successive stages of identity formation, \nmediated by micro-level interaction, through which we develop social selves. Identity \nis not a fixed state of being but an ongoing process of becoming, whereby actors make \nprogressive commitments to their roles (Becker, ibid.). The meanings attached to \nthese, like all symbolic social objects, are negotiated through interaction (Blumer \n1969). Identities are not just private and subjective but social and relational matters \n(Williams 2000), defined through dialogue with significant others (Mead 1934). \nActors use these co-constructed narratives to make sense of themselves and perform \nidentity work (Snow and Anderson 1987) by telling stories of the self (Holstein and \nGubrium 2000). \n \nIdentity careers were defined by Strauss (1969) as a series of movements through a \nsequence of social positions, roles or statuses, resulting in self-transformation. \nGoffman (1961a: 119) referred to “any social strand of any person’s course through \nlife”. This is both subjectively experienced and objectively organised, involving a \n“patterned series of adjustments made by the individual” to their placement and \npositioning by others (Becker 1952: 470). In organisational settings, such transitions \nmay be normatively regulated by institutionalised status passages (Glaser and Strauss \n1971) and marked by ceremonial rites of passage (Van Gennep 1909).  \n \nTypologies and taxonomies show how identity trajectories vary in their content, form \nand temporal patterning. They may involve a sudden or dramatic change that causes a \nradical reorganisation of the self (Athens 1995) and biographical disruption (Bury \n1982), such as spinal injuries ending a sporting career (Smith and Sparkes 2008). \nConversely, there may be a more protracted process of gradual realisation that a \nprevious role no longer fits, such as the decision to leave religious orders (Ebaugh \n1988). Temporary disruptions (Strauss, ibid) lead to the suspension of normal duties, \nfor example in Parsons’ (1951) sick role, while actors who play an unexpected role \nsuccessfully (Strauss, ibid.), such as surviving a terrorist attack, find that it gives them \na fresh perspective. Coming out is the interactional sequence triggered by the \nproclamation of private information to a public audience (Strauss, ibid.), most \nobviously with non-normative sexualities. Finally, turning points or moments of \nepiphany (Strauss, ibid.) represent critical junctures in the life course. Pivotal events \nsymbolically divide the life into a time ‘before’ and ‘after’ self-transformation, \nevoking revelatory ‘awakenings’ (DeGloma 2010).  \n \nMoral careers involve status evaluation by significant others (Goffman 1961a), such \nas ‘moral entrepreneurs’ (Becker 1963): powerful authority figures, such as police \nofficers, who decide which labels are applied to whom, and how much they stick. \nDeviant careers involve a sequence of rule-breaking action being caught and publicly \nlabelled, with consequences for self-identity. This can involve the management of \nstigma, or spoiled identity (Goffman 1963). Moral and/or deviant careers are familiar \nconcepts in Symbolic Interactionism, widely applied in empirical studies of people \nbecoming marijuana users (Becker 1953), homosexuals (McIntosh 1968), runners \n(Altheide and Pfuhl 1980), skydivers (Hardie-Bick 2005) and shy (Scott 2007). \n \n \nBecoming a ‘non-’ versus non-becoming \n \nHowever, implicit in these theories is the assumption that actors follow trajectories in \npursuit of a positively defined identity. One learns how to play a role, present a self, \nor manage an attribute, as a symbolic social object (Blumer 1969). This applies even \nwhen the object is undesired, such as a stigmatising label: it is still a ‘something’ with \na recognised presence, whose implications are inevitably ‘fateful’ (Goffman 1967) for \nsocial relations. Paradoxically, identities based on difference and otherness share this \nassumptive basis, being defined relationally, by contrast to something else that they \nare not (Williams 2000). The marginalised, ‘abject other’ (Kristeva 1982) exerts a \npowerfully strong presence through its conspicuous absence, bringing into question \nnormatively proscribed identities.  \n \nNegatively defined identities can also be proudly claimed, and thereby become \npositive. Dramaturgical role distance (Goffman 1961b) allows actors to perform \ndetachment from a resented ‘negational self’ (Chriss 1999), but with the motive of \ndefensively asserting another, preferred identity. Thus Mullaney (2006) discusses \nvoluntary virginity as an example of  ‘never identities’ based on ‘not doings’, but \nemphasises that this involves active identity work in repudiating the potential attribute \nthrough ‘demonstrated resistance’ to compulsory sexuality. Meanwhile, Ebaugh \n(1988) outlined the process of role exit, or ‘becoming an ex-’, as a career trajectory of \nprogressive disengagement from a previously significant identity. Thus just as one \ncan become a something, one can become a non-something, an ex-something, or a \nsomething-else, and all of these are positively defined identities.  \n \nBut what about those who do not become a something - who start to move along a \ncareer trajectory but never reach the end? The identity is still meaningful and \nreflectively considered, but does not turn out to be a centrally significant ‘master \nstatus’ (Hughes 1945). A persistent identity potential draws people along, but \ndisengagement with one or more aspects of it leave this ultimately unfulfilled. \nBrekhus (1998) suggests there has been a lack of research into such ‘unmarked’ \nidentities, even though they comprise the majority of social life. Most people are not \nthings or types, and do not fall into remarkable categories, but we do not study them. \nBy contrast, ‘marked’ identities, which are deviant or extraordinary, command a \ndisproportionate amount of sociological attention. This article responds to Brekhus’s \ncall for more empirical studies of unmarked identities, to foreground mundane and \nordinary experiences.  \n \nStages of non-becoming mirror those of conventional becoming, but appear as \ninverted mirror images: not finding out, not coming out, and so on. The process of \nidentity repudiation and dismissal involves ‘non-events’ and ‘non-issues’, which are \nsignificant in their unremarkableness. Traversing these nebulous objects involves \nerratic journeys compared to the linear logic of becoming. Crucially, however, these \nare still socially negotiated processes, mediated by interaction with significant ‘career \nothers’ (Lindesmith et al 1999).  \n \nCareer contingencies - the social encounters and relationships influencing the \nlikelihood of pursuing a trajectory (Becker 1963) - still occur, but instead of \nencouraging progressive commitments, support non-identification. Some social \nidentities are less discernable and harder to imagine as realistically ‘possible selves’ \n(Markus and Nurius 1986). They may be less culturally valued, ratified and \nsanctioned, and so unavailable to claim, or reluctantly attributed by others. Their \nmeanings may be unfamiliar, fuzzier or harder to negotiate in interaction, and the \npaths towards them less well-trodden. Identities may be picked up, toyed with but \nultimately dropped, or put aside to use as mere ‘adjuncts’ or ‘reserves’ (Gross and \nStone 1964) when other roles become more salient (Stryker 1968). Moral \nentrepreneurs may intervene to dissuade rather than encourage deviants to engage \nwith labels. There may be no sudden, epiphanous turning point towards the new \nidentity, but conversely, a gradual drift away from it.  \n \nJourneys of negatively non-becoming are therefore important to study as a \nphenomenon in their own right, which are qualitatively different from journeys of \npositively becoming.  \n \n \nMethodology \n \nThe data presented here come from a two-year study funded by the Leverhulme Trust \n(grant code RPG-2012-575) exploring asexual identities and practices of intimacy. \nThis combined two qualitative methods: biographical interviews with 50 people, of \nwhom 27 kept two-week diaries. The data were thematically analysed using the \nsoftware program NVivo 10.  \n \nWe recruited participants from asexual online communities such as AVEN (Asexual \nVisibility and Education Network), Tumblr and Twitter, but also the local press, \ncommunity centres and LGBTQ groups. We hoped to reach a greater diversity of \npeople, avoiding the usual demographic bias of asexuality research (Carrigan 2011). \nDespite this, the majority of our sample were white, female, college-educated and \naged 18-29. Volunteers described a range of orientations, including hetero-, bi-, pan- \nand homo-romantic; aromantic; grey-A; demi; polyamorous and sex-averse. 150 \npeople contacted us, of whom we selected 50 by random number generator. \n \nThe biographical interviews (on which we focus in the article) asked participants to \nreflect on their identity over the life course, focusing on how and to what extent \nasexuality had affected it. Their unstructured form, as ‘conversations to a purpose’ \n(Burgess 1984), asked interviewees simply to “Tell me about the key events and \nexperiences in your life where asexuality has been relevant.” Author B conducted \nmost of the interviews via Skype, given the international dispersal of the sample, \nthough some were conducted face-to-face within the UK.  \n \nThe diaries were kept for 14 consecutive days, in all but one case after the interview. \nDiaries are well-suited to exploring the micro-level of everyday life (Elliott 1997) and \nintimate relationships (Gabb 2009). We asked participants to consider three questions \neach day. These were to recall: a social interaction that had made them aware of their \nasexuality; an occasion when they had felt close to someone or something; and an \nexperience concerning asexuality that had felt difficult or uncomfortable. Participants \nwere encouraged to write free-text responses, and the electronic format of the \ndocuments meant they could take as much space as they wished.  \n \n \nAsexuality as non-identity \n \nContrary to expectations, one striking finding was that asexuality was not always \nexperienced as a social identity. Although all participants had volunteered because \nthey felt the term described them in some way, some regarded asexuality as an \nattribute of marginal importance, not centrality, to their sense of self.  While it was \nuseful as a pragmatic description of behaviour, or a label for their feelings, they did \nnot claim it as a fully fledged identity. This was not a universal rule across the \nsample, and some participants did express a strong asexual (‘Ace’) identity. Delphi \nsaid, “I think it’s a very big part of how I see myself… if I had to come up with five \nwords, it would definitely be one of them. I don’t see any aspect of my life that would \nreally have been the same if I hadn’t been asexual.” We do not wish to underplay the \nimportance of asexual identification for these people, and report on their experiences \nelsewhere (Dawson, McDonnell and Scott, in press). However, the focus of this paper is \non a notable subset of the sample (seven out of 50) who resisted such strong \nassociations.  \n \nOften, asexuality was not a foundational basis of self-identity because it was negatively \ndefined, as a lack or absence of sexual desire and/or attraction. Participants spoke about \nit as an emptiness, a gap in their lives where something was missing, although not \nmissed. In terms of life trajectories, asexuality was a path not chosen, a social action not \nperformed, a way of being not practised. When asked about asexuality, there was \nliterally nothing to talk about: \n \nI haven't been very militant about pursuing it. I am very reluctant to define \nmyself with a negative and I feel that's exactly what asexuality does. You’re \ndefining yourself by what you're not.  (Immy) \n \nI see asexuality as something that defines who you are, but because it’s \nsomething you don’t do… there’s millions of things I don’t do, and I don’t go \ntelling people those things either... You know, I don’t go round telling people \nthat I don’t like dusting! (Nate) \n \nWith hindsight, this seemed obvious. If social identities are defined by claimed \nattributes, values and preferences (Jenkins 2004), then how (and why) would people \nform an identity around something that does not exist and has never been there? \nAlthough there are existentialist philosophical arguments for regarding ‘nothingness’ as \na conscious state of being with which one should engage in ‘good faith’ (Sartre 1943), \nthis was not a meaningful interpretation in this group’s lived experiences. \n \nOther participants acknowledged asexuality but saw it as a relatively insignificant \naspect of their lives. It was a partial and peripheral, but not central, feature of a multi-\ndimensional self (Lindesmith et al 1999), and ultimately of limited relevance:  \n \n \nIt doesn’t feel like an identity much. It feels like something that’s part of me, but \nit’s not who I am. (Sophie) \n \nIt is a part of who I am. But, you know, it’s in with all the other parts, so it \ndoesn’t rule my life… It just ‘is’. (Ed) \n \nIn Stryker’s (1968) structural Symbolic Interactionism, identity is imagined as a \nhierarchical cluster of roles, varying in two dimensions. Salience refers to the \nprominence and likelihood of enacting any particular role rather than others, while \ncommitment indicates the depth of meaning attached to it. This group explained that \nasexuality was less important to them than other, more salient characteristics, and/or \nless socially visible:  \n \nI have other things that are more deeply ingrained in me that I know are true \nand important…  I’m a teacher, that’s a big thing. And I’m whatever, an \nempathetic person, a curious person... it means more to me to use those terms to \nthink about what makes me who I am. (Lizzie) \n \nActually, because nobody else knows that [I’m asexual], it’s fairly \nmeaningless. Nobody else would say I have that identity because I don't, to \nthem. If identity is the way you identify yourself to the world - I don't. (Lisa) \n \n \nThey then felt uncommitted to asexuality as a role-identity, describing it as a ‘non-\nissue’, unimportant and comparatively boring: \n \nIt’s not really important because it’s - asexuality, it’s basically a non-issue from \nthe start so it doesn’t really matter. I don’t really care, because I think there are \nso many more important things in life and since sex isn’t important to me, I \ndon’t think about the lack of it either. I think about what I have to read for next \nweek, or I think about how many pages I have to draft to my supervisor for next \nmonth for my thesis, and I think about what types of courses I’m going to take \nlater in the autumn... that’s what my life is about right now and so I don’t really \ncare about the non-issue that asexuality is.  (Kath) \n \nNon-becoming is still a journey, however, and in the remainder of this paper, we \nshow how these seven non-identified participants had reached this point. Occasional \nquotations from others are included for the purpose of comparison, but the main focus \nis on this subset. We suggest three phases in this process, identifying the relevant \ncareer contingency factors (key events and interactions) within each that contributed \nto an overall pattern of non-progression. Mirroring inversely the sequential stages of \nbecoming, the accounts convey a gathering momentum that led actors away from the \nidentity that could have been. Through a process of cumulative attrition, everyone \nbegan from the same starting point of potential positive identification, but progressed \nto differing extents, additional numbers falling off the path at every step.  \n \nIt should be noted that this is an ideal typical model that, for the purposes of \nexplanatory clarity, presents an artificially neat chronology. In reality, non-becoming \ntrajectories are messy and do not unfold in a smooth, linear fashion. Stages can occur \nsimultaneously rather than consecutively (e.g. dipping one’s toe into online \ncommunities whilst not coming out to family), although some do imply chronological \nsequencing (‘not finding out’ must logically precede ‘not communicating’), and \npeople may move erratically between them, trying out different ideas, returning to \nplaces and changing their minds. If we imagine a line of stepping-stones over a river, \npeople may take one or two steps before turning back or falling off, hop on and off \nthe same stones, move hesitantly back and forth, or reach the end but not make the \nfinal jump to shore. The stones may be arranged non-linearly, like a mosaic, \nencompassing an infinite array of circuitous routes. Participants’ recounted stories \nwere not coherent narratives but complex, entangled plotlines, further complicated by \nthe specific life circumstances of the traveller. Thus in the following discussion, some \nparticipants appear at more than one stage, although others illustrate one in particular.   \n \n \n1. Non-issues: false starts \n \nAsexuality must be recognised and engaged with before it can be accepted (or \nconsciously dismissed). The first trajectory stage of becoming asexual involves a \nperiod of self-questioning, discovery and making sense of the term ‘asexual’, just as \nCarrigan (2011) outlined, although we add that this is a socially interactive process. \nParticipants in our study who did positively self-identify realised that the concept was \nrelevant after comparing themselves to significant others in their social milieux, from \nfriends and family to media representations. The sexual imperative (Przybylo 2011) \nwas culturally pervasive: as Liam said, “It just comes up. It’s just everywhere.” \n \nThis echoes classic models of social selfhood, whereby actors construct ‘looking glass \nselves’ (Cooley 1902) by viewing themselves from the perspective of others. \nRegarding oneself as a symbolic object (Blumer 1969) allows the actor to discern an \nimage of ‘Me’ that is publicly perceived and socially consequential, in contrast to the \nprivately subjective ‘I’ (Mead 1934). Many participants came to think of themselves \nas different through social comparisons to the generalized (sexual) other who \nconfronted them throughout their everyday lives. As Milkie (1999) argues, ‘reflected \nappraisals’ – beliefs about what others believe or consider important – can affect self-\nimage, even if the individual does not believe or value the same things themselves.  \n \n \nNon-difference and normalization \n \nHowever, different experiences of interaction can lead to a non-awareness of \nasexuality. Reflected appraisals that do not strike the individual as incongruent with \ntheir own self-image are unlikely to highlight the attribute as remarkable. Thus for our \nseven non-identified participants, one contingency was that they might encounter \nothers who prompted comparisons based on similarity rather than difference, as \ndialectical aspects of identity (Lawler 2008). As Sophie explained, this could have a \ncounteractive, normalizing effect: \n \nI think that’s part of the reason I didn’t have any suspicions that I was asexual, \nbecause I was still interested in romantic relationships. And so that was very \nnormalizing for me… when I was in high school, people that were my friends \ndidn’t talk about sex very much either, for religious reasons… I don’t know if it \nwas just around me, or if that was true in general, or if I just lived in such a \nsmall, conservative town that nobody thought it was important to talk about it. \n(Sophie) \n \n \nUnmarked identity \n \nA second contingency concerned whether or not actors were aware of the word \n‘asexual’ and its potential as an identity category. This resonates with Brekhus’s \n(1998) discussion of marked and unmarked identities: whereas those who felt \ndifferent from significant others and then came across the term might use it to explain \nthis otherness, those for whom the label was absent formed identities around \nalternative attributes. Asexuality was perceived not as a central figure in their lives, \nbut as an unmarked background.  \n \nLisa, in her late thirties, was older than most of our participants who positively self-\nidentified, and reflected on this generational difference. Lisa described herself as \n‘asocial’ and introverted, and said her young adulthood had preceded the Internet age. \nUntil recently, she had not encountered the term ‘asexual’ in public discourses, much \nless used it in her social circles. Instead she had built up a strong occupational \nidentity, with asexuality remaining dormant as an unexplored blind spot:  \n \nIn my day-to-day life at the moment, nobody knows that I am asexual… It’s \nnever been discussed and I would never bring it up so it’s not an explicit \nfeature of my life at all. I don't really think about it and that has been the case \nfor quite a while... I didn't have a word to describe my lack of attraction. Before \nreading the stuff on AVEN and online, I wouldn't even have had the concept of \nidentity - there is a whole language and way of thinking about things which is \njust completely not part of my thinking. (Lisa) \n \n \n2. Non-events: communicative negation \n \nFor those who passed through the stage of  (not) ‘feeling different’ and (not) ‘finding \nout’ about asexuality, the next step on the trajectory was not communicating or \nmiscommunicating the identity in ways that negated its existence. Whether or not \nasexuality emerged as a symbolic social object (Blumer 1969) depended on its \nnegotiated meaning in situated interaction contexts: it was only when the term was \ninvoked and used that it became pragmatically effective, or ‘real in its consequences’ \n(Thomas and Thomas 1928). To the extent that it held shared meanings, the object \nwas communicated successfully, but often this conversation of gestures (Mead 1934) \nwas interrupted. Thus a second set of contingencies concerned the extent to which \nasexuality ‘called out’ the same set of interpretive meanings in actor and audience \n(ibid.), and was procedurally (in-)consequential (Schegloff 1992). \n \n \nNon-announcements and misplacements \n \nIdentity claims are negotiated between actors and audiences in social encounters, as \noccasions of joint social action (Blumer 1969). In Stone’s (1962) model, actors make \n‘announcements’ about their current roles and characteristics, but these claims may \nnot be accepted. Audiences make their own interpretations, and their attributions or \n‘placements’ of the actor may locate them in different social categories. An \nincongruity between announcements and placements renders an identity claim \nunsuccessful, echoing Goffman’s distinctions between virtual and actual identities \n(1963), or impressions given versus given off (1959).  \n \nSome participants explained that they had attempted to engage with the asexual \nidentity category, but that others had been unreceptive to it, or defined them \ndifferently. Hostile reactions to coming out were occasionally reported, although \nthese tended to backfire by making actors more defiant. More often, asexual peers \noffered certain prescriptions of the identity that did not resonate with the actor’s \npersonal experience. Kath explained how she had struggled to locate herself within \nthe array of sub-lexical categories presented by the online communities. She felt \nobliged to ‘label myself’ and give the ‘correct response’ in order to be accepted into \nthis group, but remained privately sceptical: \n \nWell, I have been thinking about this because what I‘ve found out with this \nAVEN website is that people label themselves to a great degree – you know, \nthey have sub-categories of everything.  And so I really tried thinking about that \nand so I would sort of say that I’m probably hetero-romantic... [But) I mean \nsometimes they’re just really confusing. I had to Google, basically and got to \nsome kind of Wikipedia article… before learning all the, what do you call it - \nwhat they all sort of mean and not mixing them up. I know what I am, but if \nother people need me to label myself I also need to know what they mean in \norder to give the, I don’t know, correct response....  (Kath) \n \nThus even if the asexual identity is personally meaningful, actors may not be able to \ndevelop it as a recognised social identity, and vice versa. Lack of audience validation \nis an important contingency factor mediating non-progression. Failing to be placed in \na desired category, and/or being placed in the wrong one, means that attempted \nidentity announcements remain limited in their procedural consequentiality.  \n \nNon-legitimation: guardians and gatekeepers \n \nRelated to this issue of (in)validation is the role of people in positions of authority, \nsuch as doctors, teachers and religious mentors. Becker’s (1963) model of the deviant \ncareer pointed to ‘moral entrepreneurs’, whose status allowed them to make \ninfluential judgements about the actor’s fate. Police officers, for example, could \ndetermine whether or not a deviant activity was classified as a crime and the \nindividual treated as a criminal. However, in careers of non-becoming, moral \nentrepreneurs wield power differently, as guardians and gatekeepers: they can block \naccess to social categories, denying actors the right to self-define in their preferred \nways:  \n \nI thought it was a good idea just in case... Because people do have hormonal \nimbalances...Maybe it was because of that, so I went for the blood test. And I \nwas absolutely convinced they would find something wrong... A couple of weeks \nlater, rang up the surgery. ‘Yeah, the tests are back: perfectly normal.’…  I was \na bit disappointed, yeah, ’cos I thought there’d be a fix. (Nate) \n \nThus trajectories of non-becoming, just like those of becoming, can involve key \nevents and fateful encounters, which are recalled as memorable turning points \n(Strauss 1969). However, the effect of this is reversed: instead of reinforcing a \nburgeoning identity, they quash it, turning the actor off towards a different path. \n \n \nComing out: non-events and non-responses  \n \nA final contingency at this stage is whether the actor decides to ‘come out’ to their \nsignificant others, and the reactions that ensue. Strauss (1969) saw coming out as a \nmeans of self-transformation, involving the public proclamation of a private identity: \none may self-identify with a group or category, but it is only when audiences bear \nwitness to the testimony of this that one’s social identity is transformed. Stories of the \nself must be ‘tellable’ (Smith and Sparkes 2008) in the audience’s eyes, with \nconventional features that provide shared horizons of expectation (Tonkin 1995). \nThus Plummer (1995) identified coming out stories as a distinct genre of biographical \nself-narratives, characterised by themes of ‘suffering, surviving and surpassing’ social \nstigma and triumphing over adversity. Meanwhile the situations in which coming out \ndramatically unfolds may be recalled as epiphanous turning points (Strauss, ibid.) in \nthe process of becoming. \n \n \nNot coming out \n \nStories of non-becoming, by contrast, feature the absence of a ‘coming out’ event, or \nits meaning being defined as insignificant. While for those holding normative \nsexualities ‘coming out’ is impossible (i.e. you don’t have to ‘come out’ as \nheterosexual to be recognised as heterosexual), for our participants ‘coming out’ \ncould be one part of a positively held asexual identity.  However, many of our \nparticipants compared their experiences to those of other groups within the LGBTQ \narray, whose positively-defined sexual orientations made coming out important, \npolitically and personally. By contrast, their own negatively defined status did not \nlend itself inevitably to this social action. Viewing asexuality as a non-issue led them \nto disregard proclamation as an irrelevance: \n \nI wouldn’t even say asexuality was that kind of thing... ‘Cos homosexuality - sex \nis still a big issue. Heterosexuality - having sex is a big issue... But asexuality - \nsex isn’t a big issue. So why do you need to go round telling people about it? I \ndon’t see it as a big deal at all. (Nate) \n \nOthers agreed that coming out was socially unnecessary, serving no pragmatic purpose: \n \nI feel like I wouldn't get anything necessarily helpful out of it… I had toyed with \nthe idea in the past of sitting all my friends down and telling them all at the \nsame time and it being this whole thing, which - it just doesn't feel like useful to \nme because the idea of coming out is weird to me. (Lizzie) \n \nThe absence of a transformative event meant that nothing subsequently changed in the \nparticipants’ everyday lives. The term remained unused in communicative social \naction, and the identity category it invoked lay dormant. Related to this was a lack of \npolitical activism, with a reluctance to reduce oneself to a misrepresentative label:  \n \n I don’t think I would ever go to like, an AVEN event. I don’t want it to be that \nhuge, of like my identity…  It’s just, it’s something incidental, I guess, which \nplays into me not necessarily wanting to come out to people, because it makes it \nfeel like it’s bigger than it is to me. It’s incidental, so it’s not really something to \ntell people. (Lizzie) \n \n \nNon-response as anti-climax \n \nSome participants attempted to come out, but the reactions of significant others \ndampened the effect. Whereas the social ratification of a proclaimed identity can create \na liberating sense of legitimation (Rubin et al 1993), a non-response, or disappointing \none, can close off this interpretative pathway. The ‘dramatic self-change’ that Athens \n(1995) described cannot occur if its staging is not supported by a receptive audience.  \n \nHowever, this also depended on the actor’s interpretation of the encounter: the same \n(non-)reaction could be experienced differently, with contrasting implications for \nidentity. Individual life circumstances and current priorities affected these \ninterpretations. For example, asexually-identifed Leah, in her early twenties, “had all \nthis worry built up inside me” and welcomed the bathos of acceptance as a delightful \nrelief (“To have it be a complete non-event was wonderful... we just went on with what \nwe were doing“). By contrast, non-identified Ed, in his forties and less concerned with \npeer approval, interpreted it as confirmation that his asexuality was a non-issue. \nNonchalance, bland indifference and dull inconsequentiality punctured and deflated \nwhat, for Leah, would have been a critical moment: \nErrr, well, it actually didn’t go that bad. [Mum] didn’t see seem shocked or \nanything by it, wasn’t upset; she just accepted it. And as for my ex… I don’t \nthink it’s something we talk about too much. (Ed) \n \n \n3. Non-consolidation: managing deviance and stigma \n \nThe third stage of the non-becoming trajectory concerns how actors experienced their \nasexuality as a socially significant attribute over the longer term. Those who had \npassed through the previous stages - engaging with the identity category, \ncommunicating it and having it socially ratified - could nevertheless end their \njourneys here, before the final stop, and not consolidate an asexual identity. Further \ncontingency factors arose as actors learned to manage the impact of asexuality on \nsocial relations, for the strategies they devised could reduce the attribute’s fatefulness. \nRather than progressively committing to asexuality as a deviant career (Becker 1963), \nthey drifted away (cf. Matza 1964) and pursued other pathways to identity. Asexuality \nremained peripheral to their sense of self, and was not consolidated into a centrally \ndefining ‘master status’ (Hughes 1945). \n \n \nNon-permanent identification  \n \nThe first contingency here was the impact of finding out about asexuality, especially \nlearning the word, upon actors’ sense of self. Medical sociologists have documented \nthe subjective importance to patients of receiving a diagnosis for contested conditions \n(Glenton 2003). Professional validation, backed by the authority of a ‘scientific’ \ninstitution, provides legitimation of both the illness’s reality and the patient’s \ncredibility, allowing access to the Parsonian sick role.  Social identities built around \nhealth statuses are consolidated by the impact of the diagnostic moment (Jutel 2009), \nas a biographical turning point in the social process of becoming sick. \n \nHowever, finding out about an unwanted or repudiated label can have a much less \npowerful effect upon identity and social relations, failing to ignite and fuel a deviant \ncareer. As with the anti-climactic experience of coming out, discursive verification is \nless of a majestic firework than a damp squib: \n \nMy perception of myself has not necessary changed. I feel like I understand \nmyself but I have been the same this whole time and so, in that sense it is also \nsort of, I don’t want to say insignificant because it’s important, but it’s not like \nmy day-to-day life will change. (Lizzie) \n \nMany participants, within and outwith our non-identifying sub-sample, recounted a \n‘Eureka!’ moment when they first stumbled across the word ‘asexual’, and the official \nvalidation of their experiences came as a relief. Yet, for many, this was a short-lived \neuphoria, which did not lead to making progressive commitments to an asexual \nidentity. Rather than experiencing a dramatic moment of epiphany (Strauss 1969), \nparticipants described a more mundane, pragmatic process of gathering and digesting \ninformation, then moving on. It was as if they simply needed to confirm their hunch, \n‘tick the box’ and stow the name away in their vocabulary of motives (Mills 1940) for \nwhen it might be needed. Finding out was just a pragmatically useful means to an end \nrather than a rewarding end in itself. It represented a transitory stage within a broader \njourney of identity exploration: a springboard on to other things: \n \n[I thought] “Yeah. That’s useful to know, yeah”. You know, like finding the \ndiagnosis for some ailment you’ve had for a long, long time. It’s just nice to \nknow. And you just get on managing it for the rest of your life. (Nate) \n \nTied in with this was an idea of provisionality and impermanence. Asexuality was not \nregarded as a definitive pathway or one-way street, but rather a situationally variable \nstate. Actors could drift (Matza 1964) in and out of this, making pragmatic choices \nabout when (not) to be asexual:  \n \nI think, because I’ve switched back and forth, it’s become more of a tool... a hat \nthat I can take on and off when it seems appropriate... I don’t like the idea of \nrestraining myself to one thing. I prefer to think of it as like, this is how I \nexperience things now and there is possibility that I might experience things \ndifferently in the future. (Lizzie) \n \n \nInvisibility and unknownaboutness \n \nA second contingency factor at this stage was the extent to which actors believed their \nasexuality was apparent to the generalized other (Mead 1934) and must be \nacknowledged in their interactions. In his account of stigma, Goffman (1963) makes a \ndistinction between attributes that are discrediting - already visible on the person and \nundeniable, such as physical disabilities, and those that are discreditable - hidden and \nconcealable, such as having a criminal record or mental health condition. The \n‘knownaboutness’ of the former means that they must inevitably be dealt with in \nsocial encounters, whereas the latter allow the possibility of  ‘passing’ as ‘normal’ \n(someone not possessing the characteristic). Managing a discreditable stigma involves \ntechniques of ‘information control’, as actors make strategic decisions about what \n(not) to reveal about themselves. However, for our seven non-identifiers, this \ncircumspection was not motivated by fear or shame, but rather a view that their \nasexuality was not anyone else’s business: \n \nI feel like all kinds of sexuality, or lack of sexuality, belong in the private \nsphere… I'm always talking to people - individually, one on one conversations, \nemails that sort of thing, but I don't feel the need to make it a public declaration \nor statement. I do believe that asexuality should have an invisible component…. \nI am very happy with the hard-won perspective on life I have acquired over the \npast couple years, but that does not make me confident that I should be \nanyone’s spokesperson! (Immy) \n \n \nExtinguishing interpretations \n \nThe final contingency here is the interpretations offered by the significant others \n(Mead 1934), especially friends, with whom the actor chooses to socialise. Such \nfigures are important in the formation of any social identity, as reference groups \nagainst whom actors develop a sense of relational selfhood (Williams 2000). \nFurthermore, in any identity trajectory, career others (Lindesmith et al 1999) mediate \nthe individual’s progression along sequential stages. However, in cases of deviant or \nstigmatised identities, significant others are particularly important to those who find \nthemselves positioned as outsiders to social norms. Goffman (1963: 32) said that \nfellow victims provide a backstage haven of comfort and moral support, “a circle of \nlament into which he [sic] can withdraw”.  \n \nIn Becker’s (1963) model of the deviant career, peer group members play a key role \nin negotiating the interpretative meaning of deviant activities (such as smoking \nmarijuana) and altering the actor’s perception of the associated identity. When \nsignificant others positively endorse an otherwise stigmatised way of life, this makes \nit easier for individuals to become progressively committed to it. Logically, then, the \nsame must happen in reverse: negative, neutral or normalising interpretations can \ndecrease the appeal and potency of a deviant identity. \n \nGoffman (1963) identified two social groups from whom the stigmatised find support. \nThe ‘own’ are people who share the attribute and understand the social predicaments \ncommonly faced. The ‘wise’ are those who do not share the attribute but are \nnonetheless knowledgeable and sympathetic to its implications. Both of these groups \nfeatured in our participants’ accounts as significant others whose attitudes had \ndiscouraged them from developing an asexual identity. \n \nOnline communities, such as AVEN, functioned as the main ‘own’ group. Many \nparticipants said that when discovering asexuality, they felt relief, comfort and \nreassurance from like-minded others who understood them. However, amongst our \nnon-identifying sub-sample, these feelings were short-lived, and online encounters \nonly fleeting. As with the prior stage of engaging with asexual discourses, participants \ndescribed more instrumental motives: they pragmatically took what they needed from \nthe group before moving on. Furthermore, the ‘own’ group’s politicised interpretation \nof asexuality could be unappealing. Few seemed willing to commit to long-term \nmembership, and this was connected with a generally apathetic attitude towards \nonline activism: \n \nI remember when I was in the first, fledgling stages of this, I went on AVEN a lot \nand I would read it and I would think about joining it, but there was something just, \nI didn’t necessarily like. Not about AVEN, but about the idea of sort of subscribing \nmyself to the asexual community, and having a stamp, and being like, “I’m asexual, \nI am part of the community, I am part of this movement.” (Lizzie) \n \nThere are YouTubers who are passionate about asexuality and explaining what \nasexuality is, [but] I didn’t want to become one of those people, so I’ve been very \nhesitant to use the term, even now. I think that I’m not necessarily engaging my \nrelationships with asexuality very much. Kind of on purpose, ‘cause I’m trying to \nkeep it all in my head, kind of keep it a little under control, ‘cause it doesn’t really \nneed to be out… I guess I don’t see a whole lot of ties with asexuality outside of \nmyself, and so I don’t have to work with my asexuality as I navigate friendships or \nmy family or anything like that. (Sophie) \n \nThe ‘wise’ group comprised friends, family and particularly relationship partners, \nwho were not asexual themselves but nonetheless sympathetic and accepting. Many \nparticipants had been or were currently involved in practices of intimacy (Jamieson \n1998), ranging from romantic flirtations to casual sexual encounters, polyamorous \narrangements, and long-term monogamous relationships. For those who identified as \nasexual, this required explicit discussion and negotiation over whether, to what extent \nand how sex would (not) figure in the relationships (Dawson, McDonnell and Scott, \nin press). For the non-identified, however, accommodating partners were those who \nshared their disinterest in sex and disinclination to talk about it. Together, they tacitly \nagreed to co-define this absence as a non-issue: \n \nI don’t know if it’s just pure luck, but I’ve never gone out with people who were \nhighly sexed anyway… You know, you’d start of being all enthusiastic and after \na while it would just peter out and neither or you would be particularly \nbothered about it; you’d rather stay at home and have a cup of tea, watch \ntelly…. So it was easy. (Nate) \n \n \nConclusion \n \nStories of non-becoming reflect an inverted mirror image of the stories of becoming \nrecognised by Symbolic Interactionism. While we know that social identities develop \nas interactionally-mediated careers, leading to positively becoming a something, non-\nsomething, or ex-something, little is known about the ‘unmarked’ process of non-\nbecoming, whereby actors start but do not continue along a path towards an identity. \nWe can discern a non-linear trajectory of stages, each involving career contingencies \nthat influence non-progression. Interactions with significant career others co-define \nthe identity’s emergent meaning as non-relevant, lacking procedural consequentiality. \nWhile most embark on the initial stages, a process of cumulative attrition means that \nmany do not reach their journey’s end. Instead of making progressive commitments to \na burgeoning identity, actors become disengaged and uncommitted. \n \nThe case of asexuality presents an illustrative example. Participants pragmatically \nconsidered, communicated and managed the term ‘asexual’, but ultimately rejected it \nas a core identity. This involved three socially interactive stages of (1) non-awareness \nthrough low role hierarchy salience, (2) communicative negation through non-\nannouncements and misplacements, non-legitimation, and anti-climactic non-\nresponses; and (3) non-consolidation of a deviant career, through non-permanent \nidentification and potency-extinguishing interpretations. \n \nThe principles outlined here hold a wider applicability to other under-researched \nsocial identities that are unmarked, unwanted, unsuccessfully claimed, rejected or \nrepudiated. For example, while atheism (as positive disbelief) is much debated, \nagnosticism (the mere absence of faith) is not. We need to learn more about why most \npeople do not become social types rather than why some do. This model of a non-\nbecoming trajectory shows how even negational symbolic social objects (non-issues, \nnon-events and non-identities) are constituted through social interaction and mediated \nby a myriad of career contingencies, emerging from encounters and relationships \nthroughout the life course.  \n \n \nReferences \n \nAltheide, D.L. and Pfuhl, E.H.
