Dissertation Committee     Sarah J Noonan, Ed.D., Committee Chair     I        February 2, 2022  Final Approval Date       /  iv ABSTRACT This qualitative narrative inquiry investigated the experiences of gay men and lesbians in a Christian church.  Thirteen participants shared stories of growing up in a Christian church, how their Christian church background influenced their sexual and spiritual journeys and what happened when the church challenged their sexuality.  They described what occurred when their sexuality came in conflict with the church.  Participants reflected on their relationships and how they had to continuously come out to people in their friendship circles, their family members, and their churches.  The study revealed how participants hide their sexuality to remain comfortable and accepted in the church. Participants told stories about how the church treated its gay men and lesbian members when they addressed policies and practices regarding sexuality.  Participants described their missions to take on leadership roles in the church, and obstacles they faced because of their sexuality.  The gay men and lesbians of the study encountered threats and suffered emotionally when churches tried to exclude them from leadership roles, wedding ceremonies, and worship activities.  Theoretical analysis was conducted using Tajfel and Turner’s (1979) social identity theory, Banaji’s unconscious bias theory (2013) and Steele and Aronson’s stereotype threat theory (2009).  This study demonstrated hardships that gay men and lesbians face in the Christian church but also includes a message of hope when churches fully embrace their LGBTQ+ members.  This study includes recommendations for further research and a call to action for churches, church leaders, members, and allies.   Keywords: church, LGBTQ+, gay, lesbian, sexuality, spirituality, ally, Human Sexuality Statement (SSHS), social identity, unconscious bias, stereotype threat    v DEDICATION  I dedicate this work to my husband, my two boys, my mom, my uncle, and family friend Melinda.  I know I have said “No” to you more times that I can make up for.  You have all given me so much room to make this happen and I could not have done it without the love and support of each of you.  I am especially grateful for Jim, Kaleb, and Zander, who loaded and unloaded an insane number of books and materials for every weekend at the cabin or trip to Colorado.  You waited for me to finish reading, or writing, or to get off a Zoom meeting even when it meant it inconvenienced you greatly.  I missed your events when it broke my heart to do so, so please know your sacrifices did not go unappreciated.  You are my reason and purpose for everything, so thank you for giving me the space to make this happen.  I love you all so very much.    I am also dedicating this to two people I lost in the beginning of this journey but who were on my mind every step of the way.  My brother Ryan and my grandma Marlys.   When I think back to how this all began, I remember the writing assignment that was required for admittance.  My brother had passed away unexpectedly just days before it was due, and I was a mess, but I wanted a Doctorate in Leadership more than anything I could imagine, so I wrote though the tears with you on my mind.  When I got accepted, the first person I called was my grandma, and I can still hear the pride in her voice when she imagined me as Dr. Elling.  Neither one of those loved ones got to see me finish this work, but I dedicate this work to both because their voices were in my head as I pushed past the hard parts.     Long before this study came to life, I was standing in my kitchen arguing with my brother over the ELCA’s Human Sexuality Statement.  I remember the conversation like it was yesterday because it was the first sign of hope for me that change was possible.  He recognized that he was fighting against one of the most foundational messages from Jesus, which is to just  vi love each other, and he completely changed his mind.   I had no idea that when I started the program that this would be my topic, but that conversation was a guiding light as it became clear this needed to be.     My grandma would have been proud of this study.  She never hesitated to embrace the LGBTQ+ community with open arms, the same as she would anyone who came across her path.  Her open compassion and the way she said “Love you little girl” to me even though I was several inches taller than her, kept me going well after I wanted to give up.   I also dedicate this work to Pastor Tim and his wife Susan.  You are the best thing to happen to our little church.  The day you walked in the Pride Parade in Sioux Falls, was the day I knew you stood for so much more than just being an open safe space for the LGBTQ+ community behind closed doors. You wore your love and support for the community on your shirt! You are the reason that I have hope that the church can make a difference and can be what the LGBTQ+ community needs.  There’s more work to be done, but you are part of what is making it possible.   Finally, but with no less enthusiasm, I need to thank the friends that stood by me through some crabby days, who got me out of the house, or on the bike when I needed a break, and who made me laugh when I wanted to cry, and sometimes just let me cry.  I thank Shelly and her family for putting up with me lugging my laptop and hiding in my room to write during our annual trip! For impromptu breakfasts, movies, card games and desserts to keep me sane.   And thank you to Beth and Angie for our girls’ getaways, and for making sure I exercised when I was spending too much time in a chair.  To each of you I am eternally grateful. You put up with a lot and you never gave up on me.  Thank you for being there, I love you all!   vii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  Who could have imagined that after this all came together that the most difficult words to come up with would be ones to adequately thank those that have helped make this happen?  There were days, weeks, even months where I wasn’t sure this would ever come together, but there were a few who believed in me, kept pushing me and encouraging me not to give up.  When I found out that Dr. Sarah Noonan would be my chair, I squealed in delight because I knew she would care deeply about this work and push me to carry it through.  That said, I am not sure she knew what she was getting on the other side.  I am so thankful to her for her constant bits of encouragement and motivation.  Her insights, her expertise, and especially her patience were the bright colored flag at the top of the mountain, telling me to keep climbing.  When Dr. Noonan established Club 21, she demonstrated her commitment to going above and beyond to see her students through and I learned tools that will be with me for a lifetime through those sessions.      I extend my sincerest appreciation to Dr Chou for her leadership and grace and for her constant guidance and encouragement.    I am grateful for the time spent, the challenging questions raised, and advice and encouragement received from my committee members, Dr. Latanya Daniels and Dr. Dana Kelly.    I am thankful for the Doctors coming out of Club 21 who shared their pain, frustrations, and valuable tools during the final stretches of our work.  Thank you to Gail Weinhold, Dale Stahl, Timothy Berndt, Maria Nakku, and Penny Dupris for paving the way to the finish line for me! Congratulations on your accomplishments!!  To Cohort 3, I would love some of Poornima’s butter chicken, I’ve missed our time together in class.  From the first week hanging out in the dorms to the many long weekends we  viii spent on our course work, I am thankful for our time together and for all I learned from each of you.  I need to give a special shout-out to Bahne Bahnson, whom I think was the first and whom I most want to be like when I grow up.  And finally, a huge thank you must go out to Nick Poppens, who never gave up on me.  I know I took forever to reply, but each nudge via text of Facebook messenger, helped push me one step closer to this final stage.  It really made a difference, and I will always be grateful.   To the Educational Leadership faculty who made the trek to Sioux Falls some cold winter weekends to lock yourselves in a room with the Sioux Falls cohort, I extend my deepest gratitude for making this program available to us.  I have treasured the experience and am a bit sad to see it end.    To Jackie Grossklaus, who works so hard behind the scenes and made everything happen for us along the way, I thank you.  To the rest of the staff at UST who made yourselves available to irregular questions at odd times, and who provided insight and guidance, please know that your work did not go unnoticed or unappreciated.   Finally, I want to thank Jack and Sherry Fonder.  You two have taught me so much about the LGBTQ+ community and you have been my guiding force to keep pushing along the way. When you stepped in to help the crazy lady who wanted to get a Pride Network going at Citi, you reminded me why this work is important.  But most importantly, you have shown me patience and grace when I mess things up as an ally and you reminded so often along the way, why this work matters.  Thank you for letting me in!     ix TABLE OF CONTENTS TABLE OF CONTENTS ABSTRACT

orientation is just another feature of our diversity as a human family.  How wonderful that God has made us with so much diversity, yet all in God’s image” (Desmund Tutu, 2011). Gay men and lesbians who seek Christian Church membership often encounter having to make a choice between their sexuality and their Christianity (Wolkimir, 2001).  Conflict within Christian churches about human sexuality exerts an adverse effect on the entire congregation, particularly on those members who may be marginalized because of their sexuality.  In the past decade, the debate on sexuality and the church has increased in focus and intensity with at least two major denominations hosting nationwide votes on related topics (SSHS, A Social Statement, 2009; Brooks, 2009, & Crary, 2019). Members and church leaders were pushing their denominations, synods, and churches to address their stance on sexual identity within the church.  My study concerned how a proposed denominational policy on human sexuality impacted the participation and experiences of gay men and lesbian members in Christian churches.     My interest in this issue started with an important event in the history of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA).  The event concerned a vote on a controversial new policy called:  Social Statement on Human Sexuality (SSHS): Gift and Trust (SSHS, 2009).  The SSHS described the church’s position of same-gender relationships.  The SSHS was the result of an extended study of how the ELCA should address sexuality within the denomination.  Two main points of contention within the SSHS were at the heart of the debate between church members: (1) whether to accept members who were in “long-term, monogamous, same-gender relationships” and, (2) whether to allow those who were in “long-term, monogamous, same-gender relationships” (A Social Statement, 2009, p. 18) to become ordained ministers within the ELCA.  The study proposed that churches be allowed (but not forced) to call gay and lesbian  2 ministers who meet the criteria mentioned above to lead their church, as well as to perform same-gender weddings and recognize and welcome people in same-gender relationships.   During the time the Human Sexuality Statement was proposed to the ELCA, I served as a youth director of a small community ELCA congregation.  Numerous people, including members of the youth group became involved in a campaign for our church to vote on whether or not to leave the ELCA.  Many young people experienced a lot of difficulty expressing their support of the SSHS because their positions often contradicted the position held by their parents.  Some students asked to help but requested to stay behind the scenes so that their parents did not discover their involvement.  As the vote neared, the tension in the church and the differences of opinion caused a lot of debate, argument, and harm as members quarreled about the SSHS.   Ultimately, my church voted to stay with the ELCA, but the vote cost the church and its members spiritually, financially, and relationally.  Many members left the church over the vote.  One member sent a letter to the church declaring that too much damage had been done and they needed to walk away.  I still read the words they sent to me with tremendous sadness over what it cost them to participate in this event.  Unfortunately, this last round was all I could handle, and I submitted my membership resignation to [XLC] today.  It’s been a long time in the coming and with lots of consideration, turmoil, and reasoning, I have come to realize that I don’t have the faith or the belief any longer.  I am strangely relieved in my revelation and am happy with it as well as to be freed from the burden of trying to believe in something (religion) that promotes the hatefulness and discrimination that it does.  No one or nothing is going to change my mind, I am at peace with my decision.  My experience as a member of an ELCA church before, during and after the vote, my position at the time as a youth director, and my personal role as an ally, all influenced my need to research this topic in depth.  As a straight cisgender female, I faced challenges in gaining the trust of the gay men and lesbians I interviewed.  I had to work harder to ensure the participants  3 understood that I would treat their stories without bias in my analysis.   I carry both ally and Christian biases that I needed to set aside as I analyzed their stories.  I also had to remain diligent in recognizing and addressing any biases I hold for or against churches based on their human sexuality policies and practices.     ELCA and UMC leaders and members need to hear the stories of those who endured countless campaigns against them.  Churches and its members fought against the LGBTQ+ communities’ ability to attend or lead worship, serve as Sunday School teachers, or marry in the Christian church — all because of who they love.  I believe other churches and denominations will also benefit from hearing those stories.  My study concerns the experiences of members who were asked to choose between their spirituality and sexuality.   Statement of the Problem, Purpose, and Significance In the past two decades, two major Christian denominations made controversial decisions on the place for LGBTQ+ members within their church (SSHS, 2009; Ioviono, 2019).  In August 2009, the ELCA, with their adoption of the Human Sexuality Statement, determined that churches within their denomination could perform weddings for same sex couples and could ordain members who are in long-term, same sex, monogamous relationships.   In Ioviono’s (2019) article on the special conference held by the United Methodist Church (UMC), the denomination took the opposite approach and voted 53% to uphold their traditional plan within the Homosexuality: Full Book of Discipline Statements (2013), which claims the following views on LGBTQ+ church participation and membership:  a. All are welcome to attend services and participate in worship;  b. “The practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching” (para. 3); c. Financial support of LGBTQ+ based groups is forbidden; d. Same sex marriages are not to be recognized or celebrated, and not conducted within UMC churches.   4 e. “Self-avowed, practicing” (para. 4) gay, lesbian and bisexual persons cannot be ordained or appointed to serve.     Some regions of the UMC have chosen to break church law by vowing not to discriminate against LGBTQ+ members seeking ordination (Human Rights Campaign, 2019).  Transgender members are not to be discriminated against and can be called to ministry within the UMC.   Although these two major denominations appear to be at odds with their stance on LGBQ+ ordination and marriage, both denominations state that all are welcome regardless of their sexuality.  Christian churches tend to agree that being a gay man or a lesbian is not a matter of choice, but some churches still claim that acting upon premarital sex is sinful.  This doctrine alone can lead to gay men and lesbian members feeling excluded from full acceptance within their church (Bozett & Sussman, 1990).  The church has led many LGBTQ+ members to feel oppressed by religion, some to the point of open hostility.     Members of the LGTBQ+ community who seek a relationship with God hear a variety of messages about how God sees their sexuality (Wolkimir, 2001).  LGBTQ+ members are forced to reconcile their relationships with their spirituality.  Some struggle to determine how they as part of the LGBTQ+ community fit within a Christian church.  If LGBTQ+ members continue to seek church membership and/or a relationship with God, they are often taught to choose between their sexuality and their Christian church membership, participation and even God’s love.  This internal conflict can lead to distress for members of the LGBTQ+ community.  LGBTQ+ members may stop believing in a Christian God or abandon their faith completely (Wolkimir, 2001).    5 Gay men or lesbians as Christians often struggle with a conflict in their identities as an LGBTQ+ person within the church, or their identity as a Christian within their LGBTQ+ community (Pitt, 2009).  LGBTQ+ Christians, often must compartmentalize their sexuality versus their spirituality or reject either their spirituality or their sexuality.  Many see the two as being incompatible (Rodriquez, 2010).  To understand what LGBTQ+ members face when their sexuality comes in conflict with desire to participate in a Christian church, it is important to learn, understand, and highlight the stories of those who have faced this struggle. This study exhibits what happens to LGBTQ+ people when they try to hold on to their Christian church membership.  I investigated the stories and personal experiences of gay men and lesbians who have participated in membership within a Christian church.  My mission was to better understand how the policies and practices of Christian churches influence gay men and lesbian membership and participation.    I designed my research to contribute to the literature on human sexuality and the Christian church and to provide perspective to churches who pose limitations on gay men and lesbian membership and participation.  I recognize that many churches have been able to avoid the topic of sexuality for many years.   When same sex marriage became legal in the United States, church leaders experienced pressure to address LGBTQ+ issues and same-sex marriage within the church (Jackson, 2019).  For the purpose of this study, I focused on three categories of Christian churches based on their policies regarding human sexuality. Churches vary from highly restricted (gay-exclusionary), to welcoming (gay-friendly), and to fully accepting (gay-embracing/Rainbow Churches) of human sexuality in all its expressions.  For simplicity I will focus on gay-friendly versus gay-exclusionary churches.   6 Research Question I adopted the following question to conduct my study: How do Christian Church policies and practices concerning the expressions of identity and human sexuality affect the experiences and faith journeys of gay men and lesbians?  The following sub-questions supported my research question: 1. How do lesbians and gay men make sense of their experiences within a Christian Church?  2. How do/did the experiences of lesbians and gay men as current or former church members affect their views of Christianity and/or Christian churches?  3. How do the experiences of lesbians and gay men in Christian Churches affect their relationships within the LGBTQ+ community or the reverse?   I used these questions to guide my research as I interviewed lesbians and gay men who were past or present members of gay-friendly or gay-exclusionary Christian churches.   Overview of the Chapters My study reveals the stories of gay men and lesbians who were faced with reconciling their spirituality and sexuality because of their involvement in a Christian church.  I interviewed 13 participants who grew up as members of either gay friendly or gay exclusionary churches and who were challenged by family members, church or school authorities, friends, or other church members because of the church’s beliefs, practices, and policies regarding sexuality.  I introduced the study and its purpose in Chapter One and described my motivation and background supporting my interest in this topic.  I provided some historical background and context based on the sexuality studies conducted by two major denominations.  I presented the challenges that churches face when addressing sexuality within the church.  I established my  7 research question and provided a statement of the significance of the problem. I ended Chapter One with the definition of terms used throughout the study.     In Chapter Two, I highlighted the literature and research relevant to my topic.  I organized the literature reviewed around the historical background of the LGBTQ+ element of the human rights movement, I shared the context of the debates from the two major Christian church denominations regarding human sexuality and I highlight political milestones that have helped elevate the conversations within churches on same gender marriage and LGBTQ+ rights.  I followed the review of literature with analytical theory that was used to examine the experiences of my participants.  I shaped the theoretical research using Tajfel and Turner’s (1979) social identity theory and Banaji’s unconscious bias theory (2013).  I also analyzed the data using Steele and Aronson’s stereotype threat theory (2009).   In Chapter Three I highlighted why a qualitative study was used and how narrative inquiry helped shape the understanding of the participants experiences in church.  I explained narrative inquiry as a methodology and described how participants were recruited and selected, what questions guided the narratives and how I collected and protected the data.  I ended Chapter Three with the limitations I faced as well as ethical considerations due to the sensitivity of the topic.    I structured the data into three themes: (1) relationships (2) church and (3) belonging.  In Chapters Four through Six, I shared the participants’ stories as related to these three themes.  In Chapter Four I described how participants faced coming out to people they were closest to and how they handled their sexuality during key periods of their life.  Finally, I described how Christian participants faced conflict with the LGBTQ+ community, including those who were hurt by the church.  In Chapter Five, I shined a light on how participants navigated their  8 experiences in church starting with early involvement, experiences with coming out to the church. and what occurred when participants came in conflict with regard to their sexuality and spirituality.  The final data chapter, Chapter Six, included stories about the importance of belonging to a community and what occurred if the community connection was broken by the church.   I included stories about participants who found their sense of community elsewhere and ended with stories about the participants current relationship to the church and church members.    Chapter Seven included the analysis of participant stories with an emphasis on how participants related to their social identities using Tajfel and Turner’s (1979) social identity theory.  I also used Banaji’s unconscious bias theory (2013) to assess what occurs when participants face church members who hold biases, which they may not be aware of regarding their sexuality and the church.  Additionally, I reviewed stereotype threat theory (Steele & Aronson, 2009) to help understand how participants responded to the pressures placed on them regarding their sexuality in the church.    In Chapter Eight I provided a summary of my research, shared what limitations were present, and provided recommendations to advance the research.  I also included a call to action to for church members, ministers, leaders, and allies to improve the experience of marginalized participants in a church.   Definition of Terms I adopted the following terms to conduct my study: Ally: “A person who is not LGBTQ [+] but shows support for LGBTQ(+) people and promotes equality in a variety of ways.” (Human Rights Campaign, 2019, para 2).  Bisexual: “A person emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to more than one sex, gender or gender identity though not necessarily simultaneously, in the same way or to the same  9 degree.  Sometimes used interchangeably with pansexual.”  (Human Rights Campaign, 2019, para. 5).  Christian: One who professes belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ (Merriam-Webster.com, n.d.).  Cisgender: “A term used to describe a person whose gender identity aligns with those typically associated with the sex assigned to them at birth.” (Human Rights Campaign, 2019, para 6).  Concealable Stigma: Preconceived perceptions about a minority that is not easily identifiable by physical characteristics, such as sexual orientation (Herek & Capitani, 1996). Conversion Therapy: A harmful, dangerous, and extreme practice used to attempt to change an individual’s sexual orientation or sexual identity (Born Perfect, 2019).   Don’t ask, don’t tell (DADT): “The discriminatory […which] prohibited qualified gay, lesbian and bisexual Americans from servicing in the armed forces and sent a message that discrimination was acceptable.” (Human Rights Campaign, 2019, para.1) ELCA: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, a Lutheran Christian Denomination. Gay: “A person who is emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to members of the same gender.  Men, women and non-binary people may use this term to describe themselves.” (Human Rights Campaign, 2019, para 9). Gay-Exclusionary: Used for the purpose of this study, to describe churches that exclude LGBTQ+ individuals as leaders or members in their churches.  Gay exclusionary churches will most likely not allow LGBTQ+ members to serve in leadership roles or become ministers.  They may allow LGBTQ+ members to attend services, but they may require celibacy and some may even ask that LGBTQ+ participants seek conversion therapy.   10 Gay-Welcoming: Used for the purpose of this study to describe churches that welcome gay and lesbian members, may even let them serve in leadership roles or become ordained ministers, but may not fully embrace their sexuality or gender.  Gay friendly churches may or may not perform same sex weddings.  Rainbow Church: Multiple participants used the term “Rainbow Church” to describe churches that fully embrace LGBTQ+ members to come as they are, serve in all leadership roles, and be ordained ministers or priests.  I adopted this term throughout the study due to participant recognition. Rainbow churches actively promote welcoming LGBTQ+ members, celebrate their sexuality and regularly host LGBTQ+ wedding ceremonies and celebrations.   Homophobia: “The fear and hatred of or discomfort with people who are attracted to members of the same sex.” (Human Rights Campaign, 2019, para. 17).  Human Sexuality:  The way people experience and express themselves sexually.  This involves biological, erotic, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual feelings and behaviors (Wikipedia, n.d.) Lesbian: “A woman who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to other women.” (Human Rights Campaign, 2019, para 18). LGBTQ+: “An acronym for “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer.” (Human Rights Campaign, 2019, para 19).   Minority Stress: Stress related to stigmatization due to minority status.  Internalized self-value based on experiences with discrimination, rejection, marginalization or hatred (Meyer,1995).     11 Queer: “A term people often use to express fluid identities and orientations that are counter to the mainstream.  Queer is often used as a catch-all to include many people, including those who do not identify as exclusively straight and/or folks who have non-binary or gender-expansive identities.  This term was previously used as a slur but has been reclaimed by many parts of the LGBTQ[+] movement.”  (Human Rights Campaign, 2019, para. 23).   Readily Apparent Stigma: Preconceived negative perceptions about a minority that is easily identified. Examples of readily apparent stigmas could be race and physical disability (Herek & Capitani, 1996). Religious Right: Conservative Christians heavily engaged in driving right winged politics (Dodds, 2012). Moral Majority: A group of socially conservative Americans organized to establish a political majority, officially disbanded in 1989 (Dodds, 2012).  Transgender: “An umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from cultural expectations based on the sex they were assigned at birth.  Being transgender does not imply any specific sexual orientation.  Therefore, transgender people may identify as straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc.” (Human Rights Campaign, 2019, para. 28).     12 CHAPTER TWO: REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE  LGBTQ+ people have historically been marginalized.  Research related to the history of the LGBTQ+ movement will open the doors to a better understanding on how progress in the movement has challenged churches to address LGBTQ+ issues within the church.  The literature provides a historical background that set the tone for the research for this study. The LGBTQ+ Human Rights Movement   Scholars claim the beginning of the LGBTQ+ movement can be traced back to a specific event that occurred on June 28 –29,1969, called the Stonewall Riots (Gordon, 2009).  The Stonewall Riots ensued over a two-day period at the Stonewall Inn bar in New York City.  The “movement” is marked with an official timestamp of “1:20 am on Saturday, June 28th, 1969” (Engel, 2001, p. 20).  During the 1960s, police raids were not uncommon for gay and lesbian bars.  In 1969, liquor licenses could be revoked if an establishment was caught serving alcohol to the LGBTQ+ community (Swenson & Peltz, 2019).  The Stonewall Inn did not have a liquor license and members were required to sign in at the door, however many used pseudonyms to preserve their anonymity (Gross, 2000).  In the early morning hours of June 28th, police were sent to the Stonewall Inn to halt liquor sales (Swenson & Peltz, 2019).  The Stonewall police raid did not go unopposed (Engel, 2001).  According to Engel (2001), over 2,000 individuals and over 400 police officers were involved in the riot, which went on for two days because of the raid.     Claims have been made that the death of Judy Garland, whom many consider to be a gay icon, triggered the events of the movement (Gross, 2000).  Her death occurred just days before the Stonewall Inn riots and her funeral was held just hours earlier on June 27th, 1969 (Romesburg, 1994).  Figure 1 shows the crowd outside the chapel where Judy Garland’s funeral  13 was held.  Some claim that due to the emotions from the death of their icon, the community decided to fight back.  Yvonne Itter, who identified as a transsexual stated, “A lot of people attended the funeral and were just sick and tired of being pushed around by the cops” (Romesburg, 2001, p. 1).  Others claim that the gay youth of the streets who were involved in the riots likely did not know who Judy Garland was or what she may have meant to the community. Fifty years later at the Stonewall 50 celebration, DJ John Michael Di Spirito closed out the night by playing Judy Garland’s “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” as he remembered those who pioneered the movement and paved the way for him and others to live with Pride as part of the LGBTQ+ community (Di Spirito, 2019).   Figure 1  Crowd Outside the Frank Campbell Chapel During Judy Garland's Funeral a Few Hours Before the Stonewall Riot 1969     While this one incident is widely known as the start of the LGBTQ+ movement, the gay men and lesbian movement undoubtedly did not commence overnight (Haider-Markel & Meier,  14 1996).  The mass gathering of gay men and lesbian participants was well underway prior to this event (Engel 2001).  While the movement itself started before Stonewall, this raid generated the spark needed to set things in motion.  Additional protests went on for several additional days (Swenson & Peltz, 2019).  Until this time, the gay men and lesbian population had cooperated with police during the raids because people lacked the support needed to resist their oppression (Engel, 2001).  The Stonewall raid and riot led to the formation of multiple groups organized to start a movement towards political change.  On June 28th, 1970, the Christopher Street Liberation Day March took place to celebrate the anniversary of the riots (Swenson & Peltz, 2019).    According to Engel (2001), several key factors played a role in the progression of the movement.  The introduction of lesbian and gay men relationships in literature and film demonstrated an interest in and recognition of those relationships in a more positive light.  Newspapers started to use the term gay instead of homosexual, recognizing and viewing same sex relationships in a more positive context.    Out of the Stonewall Inn event, several movements began to take place, signifying progress politically. However, the movement within Christian churches did not begin to shift until much later.  The LGBTQ+ movement took shape throughout multiple organizations.  The military has played a role throughout United States history in how the LGBTQ+ movement progressed.  I reviewed how the military influenced the movement in the next section. The Lesbian and Gay Men Movement in the Military The Stonewall riots are used by many to mark the beginning of the LGBTQ+ rights movement, however, Engel (2001) argued that progress was made as early as World War II.  Although being gay was not banned in the military, gay men were excluded and discriminated against based on their sexual orientation (Engel, 2001).  Gay men and lesbians were “subjected  15 to constant discrimination and stigma while trying to do what most heterosexual individuals take for granted, serving their country” (Sinclair, 2009, p. 1).  Because of these circumstances, both men and women had to make a choice between their sexuality and serving their country (Bérubé, 2010).    According to Bérubé (2010), psychiatrists at the time believed that lesbians and gay men were not suitable for combat and thereby warned against accepting them into the military.  In 1940, to become a stronger voice in the war, psychiatrists pushed for psychiatric evaluations of military personnel before they entered the war (Bérubé, D’Emilio, & Freedman, 2010).  Sexuality, including whether men experienced erotic feelings toward other men, became part of the screening process in determining emotional fitness to serve.  If applicants offered a positive response, men were rejected and considered mentally ill (Engel, 2001).      During this time, gay men and lesbians were disqualified from the war because of their sexuality (Bérubé et al., 2010).  Due to an overflow in the prison system in 1941, people were discharged instead of jailed.  If a soldier serving in the military was caught in a sexual act with someone of the same sex, they could be discharged as mentally ill.  The military response to gay men opened the doors for other organizations to use the mental health defense as a reason to deny membership to gay men and lesbians.    When World War II (WWII) generated a significant increase in need for military support, officials opened enlistment to include gay men and lesbians (Bérubé et al., 2010).  Surveys indicated that 650 thousand to 1.6 million gay men or lesbians enlisted during WWII.  According to Engel (2001), it is unlikely that this was due to more people changing their sexuality, rather, it was likely influenced by the proximity of larger groups of men in the military and women in the  16 labor force.  The war led to gay men and lesbians being around people of the same sexual identity in close quarters with limited privacy (Bérubé et al., 2010).   Some would say this “caused” gayness in men, but gay men were more likely to find and forge relationships with other gay men (Engel, 2001).  Although enlistment restrictions were loosened, gay men still felt the need to hide their sexual activities due to social and systemic discrimination and oppression (Sinclair, 2009).  Gay men became the target of dismissal when the war concluded and the need for military personnel became less prevalent.  (Bérubé et al., 2010).   Women in the Women’s Army Corps had opportunities to explore their sexuality and were encouraged to form intense friendships (Engel, 2001).  The Army discouraged supervisors from questioning or punishing same sex relationships between women.  That said, lesbians faced additional challenges during the movement.  Women in the early 1970s viewed their involvement in the movement as both a personal struggle and a survival strategy. They kept their sexuality a secret, but lesbians needed the solidarity of other women in the women’s right movements.  Engel argued people likely needed to feel valued before anyone would take their rights seriously as lesbians.   According to Engel (2001), the gay rights movement faced some serious tests by the early 1970s.  Law enforcement arrested gay men with greater frequency and the movement identified more closely with, and put more emphasis on, the issues men faced.  Women began to abandon the gay rights movement in favor of working with women’s liberation groups, instead they became more inclusive and focused on the needs of women.   Similar connections regarding how the LGBTQ+ rights movement progressed through the Christian Church may be made.  The policies and practices enacted by the military and the  17 politics surrounding these decisions share a common pattern.  LGBTQ+ members who wished to serve in the military or participate in church activities did so in silence.  I explore the concept of serving in silence with a comparison between military and church policies in the next section.  Serving in Silence Within the 1994 National Defense Authorization Act was the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy (DADT) (Belkin, 2003).  This policy opened the doors for LGBTQ+ people to serve in the military by restricting recruiters from asking those enlisting if they identified as gay.  In exchange for being allowed to serve, LGBTQ+ people were required to maintain secrecy regarding their sexuality.   While the official DADT policy was designed for the military, the concept showed up in other major groups as well.  Large groups such as academia, the workforce (Bilimoria & Stewart, 2009), sports (Campbell, 2011), and other large organizations (such as the Christian Church) used silence to oppress the LGBTQ+ members within organizations.   Silence in the Church Religious leaders, followed closely by mainstream Christians, have claimed that you cannot be a gay man or a lesbian and be a Christian (Piazza, 1999).  Churches tended to address sexuality as a celebration of heterosexual marriage (Johnson, 1998).  Because celibacy is a requirement for relationships between unmarried participants in many churches, same sex relationships are forbidden under that umbrella (Johnson, 1998).  Some churches that have specific policies regarding same sex relationships may choose to avoid preaching specifically to those relationships and avoid asking about partnerships.  LGBTQ+ Christians, in return, may hide their identities within the church and avoid sexuality conversations with other church members.  This may lead to same sex couples feeling invisible if they attend a Christian Church (Piazza, 1999).    18 Silence as a Risk Regardless of which organization a member of the LGBTQ+ community belongs to, (which may be multiple), hiding an integral part of a personal identity can have lasting negative implications.  Imposing restrictions on sharing personal details of oneself may produce harmful effects, such as feelings of loneliness and isolation (Davis & Franzoi, 1986).  An additional danger exists when keeping one’s sexuality a secret.  Hiding this fact from people close to LGBTQ+ individuals, such as friends and colleagues, may lead to a breach of trust (Sinclair, 2009).      Gay members of groups or organizations risk facing minority stressors if stigmas related to their sexuality exist (Meyer, 1995).  Brooks (as cited in Balsam, 2008) defined minority stress as the experience of feeling inferior based on one’s minority status, such as race, gender, or sexual orientation which could lead to negative life events.  Military members who identify as LGBTQ+ faced the additional danger of not being able to find mental support for the minority stresses encountered due to the fear associated with coming out and facing unfavorable discharge (Johnson & Buhrke, 2006).  Further, according to Balsam (2008), lesbians have a heightened risk of negative life events related to minority stress due to their sexual identity and gender.   AIDS Influence on the LGBTQ+ Movement The Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic delivered a hard blow to the gay men and lesbian movement due to the number of deaths AIDS caused (Piazza, 1999).  Warning signs ignored in the first several years of the epidemic escalated to mounting tragic deaths in 1985 (Shilts, 2007).  AIDS clinics did not have the resources, skills, or knowledge to handle the overwhelming number AIDS patients coming through their doors.   It was not until tragedy also took a surprising turn that the public, including people outside the LGBTQ+ community, came together to fight the AIDS epidemic (Engel, 2001).   19 Unfortunately, it took recognition that the disease extended to heterosexuals before significant action commenced (Shilts, 2007).  The growing number of cases from blood transfusions and talk of wide-spread heterosexual transmissions began attracting media attention, which would eventually translate into funds and resources.    The Normal Heart, a play written by Larry Kramer and performed in New York City public theater reached people as nothing had to date (Shilts, 2007).  Even before the initial performance, New York Mayor Ed Koch swiftly established a plan for local AIDS services, including long term care, day-care programs for children with AIDS, and funds for AIDS patient care teams.    Skeptics within the community insisted that it would take a huge event, such as the disease infecting someone famous (at the time rumored to be Burt Reynolds) before sufficient attention was received by the press (Shilts, 2007).  The diagnosis and death of Rock Hudson in 1985 became the distinction between the time leading up to the epidemic to the time of significant and urgent action.  Unfortunately, by the time America responded it was too late to stop the spread of the disease.  Awareness levels reached new heights, which finally inspired people outside the gay men and lesbian populations to support the cause and become involved in the movement (Engel, 2001).  This response, in turn, generated noteworthy financial support for research by the American government (Shilts, 2007).       To progress the research and funding support, it became critical to ensure that society was not viewing AIDS as a gay disease (Gamson, 1989).  Fear of discrimination deterred some members of the LGBTQ+ community from supporting the movement (Engel, 2001).  For the movement to progress, finding activists who were outside the LGBTQ+ community was essential (Reger, Myer, & Einwohner, 2008).  Allies who took a stand regarding the rights of  20 LGBTQ+ persons, contributed to the movement (Engel, 2001).     When the AIDS epidemic first appeared, one of the major deterrents to getting involved in the AIDS movement was the desire to keep one’s sexuality a secret (Engel, 2001).  It took the scare of heterosexual infiltration of the disease to escalate involvement (Shilts, 2007).  When the movement no longer treated AIDS as an exclusively gay disease, heterosexuals became active participants in the search for a solution.  Although several years delayed, the LGBTQ+ community, along with a growing number of heterosexuals, began to raise influence through private health, medical research, federal funding, and resources. Heterosexual participation in the AIDS epidemic influenced others to join and participation in the movement increased at an accelerated rate (Engel, 2001).  Heterosexuals found commonalities with their gay men and lesbian partners in their desire to find a common solution (Reger et al., 2008).      Separating the gay movement from the AIDS movement did not come without consequences for LGBTQ+ equality.  The separation made the fight to normalize being gay or lesbian more difficult (Gamson, 1989).   The Movement Towards “Normalization”  The language used when speaking about gay men and lesbians has played a role in the movement towards normalization. Traditionally, six passages in the Christian Bible are frequently used to portray homosexuality as something unnatural or sinful (Rodriguez, 2010).  Terms such as “perverted,” and “an abomination” often appear in reference to LGBTQ+ relationships by fundamentalist groups. The shifting of the language used to identify LGBTQ+ people away from the more clinical term “homosexual” has provided favorable progress for the movement.  “Gay Pride” (Engel, 2001, p. 14) has become the positive force in developing a more affirmative vocabulary around same gender relationships.  Forging the LGBTQ+ and Ally  21 relationship helped take the focus away from the negative and gave LGBTQ+ people and their allies a sense of “we-ness” in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights (Reger et al., 2008).   Gay Pride also provided a boost of confidence surrounding sexuality.  In 1988, Robert Eichberg and Jean O’Leary established a day of celebration of the LGBTQ+ community by commemorating the anniversary of the 1987 march on Washington for gay and lesbian rights (George Mason University, 2017).   This date is celebrated worldwide as a day to highlight the community and to provide support and encouragement for LGBTQ+ individuals to openly share their sexuality with their families and/or friends (National coming out day, n.d.).  National Coming Out Day occurs every October 11th.  Prior to establishing a gay pride movement, the fear of being discovered as a gay man or as a lesbian was almost unbearable for many (Engel, 2001).  The establishment of Pride Month as an official commemorative month occurred in 1995 and is celebrated each year in June to honor the community and celebrate the progress that was started with the Stonewall Riots in June of 1969 (Library of Congress, n.d.). Ally Influence An ally is defined as “A person who is a member of the ‘dominant’ or ‘majority’ group who works to end oppression in his or her personal and professional life through support of, and as an advocate with and for, the oppressed population” (Washington & Evans, 1991, p. 195).    Allies share a common ground with those they are advocating for, without being direct beneficiaries of the cause (Myers, 2008).  While there is little self interest in the results of the movement, allies play a vital role in progressing the gay civil rights movement and can generate significant gains for the movement over what the beneficiary group alone may produce (Myers, 2008).     Allies often face challenges in becoming involved in the gay rights movement.  Their  22 engagement may be unpopular with family and friends, but they may also face resistance from the LGBTQ+ community they are trying to support (Washington & Evans, 1991).  Allies should be cognizant of their heterosexual privileges and sensitive to their LGBTQ+ partners as they engage in the movement (Washington & Evans, 1991).  Because the minoritized community are an at-risk population, allies may have to prove their alignment and that they understand the depth of what is at stake (Myers, 2008).  Allies do not face the same risks as LGBTQ+ people in the cause (Washington & Evans, 1991).   According to Myers (2008), allies are often caught in the middle of not being able to fully connect with the beneficiaries of the movement, and also excluded from the population they are challenging.  They may even face anger towards the heterosexual population and personal guilt for being a part of the out-group (Washington & Evans, 1991).  These challenges can make ally recruitment difficult.  One of the challenges heterosexual allies face involves their need to recognize that they cannot fully experience what their gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer+ counterparts face to transition to full advocacy (Washington & Evans, 1991).  Listening, acceptance, support, and inclusiveness are important efforts of advocacy for the ally towards LGBTQ+ rights (Washington & Evans, 1991).  Whether in a church or a place of employment, allies become important advocates during policy and program development.  Allies see engagement in the gay rights movement as a moral issue and a principle of justice.    Political Influence on the Movement Gordon (2009) claimed that in 1998 in Texas, two men were arrested while having sex and later convicted of sodomy.  The United States Supreme Court overturned the lower courts’ ruling in the case of Lawrence v. Texas in 2003.  At the time of the ruling, only four states enforced sodomy laws.  Because the courts believed that laws against sodomy violate a human’s  23 right to privacy, the Supreme Court ruled that sodomy laws were unconstitutional.  In essence, this ruling legalized sex between men (McBride, 2006).  This was the first major civil rights win for gay rights which inspired the movement to move on to the next battle in marriage equality (Posner, 2005).    Former President Bill Clinton made the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) a law in 1996, ensuring that all language around marriage and spouses referred to the relationship between people of the opposite sex (Gordon, 2009).  In November of 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Court deemed same-sex marriages as constitutional (Becker & Scheufele, 2009).  Consequently, in 2004, banning same-sex marriage became a key driving force in the Presidential election (Abramowitz, 2004).  In addition to serving as a Presidential platform, the same-sex marriage ban became a ballot measure in 11 states during the 2004 election (Becker & Scheufele, 2009).  States involved in the Gay Marriage Ban ballots of 2004 sought to define marriage explicitly as between a man and a woman (Campbell & Monson, 2008).     Republicans considered millions of Evangelical Christians a strong voter base during the 2004 election (Abramowitz, 2004).  The same-sex marriage position pulled in the Evangelical Protestant base, while alienating a portion of the secular vote (Campbell & Monson, 2008).  According to Campbell and Monson (2008), at the time of their study, approximately 65% of the Evangelical Protestant population strongly opposed same-sex marriage.  Additionally, the secular vote claimed only 12% of their voter base strongly opposed same-sex unions.  Becker and Scheufele (2009) argued that religious beliefs about same-sex marriage are even more influential on public opinion than mainstream media and specific political knowledge of the issue.     In 2006, midterm elections led to 13 states proposing same-sex marriage legislation with 12 voting to ban same-sex marriage (Becker & Scheufele, 2009).  The Arizona measure  24 proposed a ban to same-sex weddings and put benefits offered to domestic partnerships (which includes both same and opposite sex long term relationships) at risk (Gordon, 2009).  Arizona was the first state to formally reject a proposal to ban same-sex unions (Campbell & Monson, 2008).  The California Supreme Court ruled in May of 2008 to legalize same-sex marriage (Becker & Scheufele, 2009).  Voters responded by adding the California Marriage Protection Act to the 2008 ballot.  It is believed that late mobilization of powerful religious groups led to the success of the measure.  Studies are currently limited past the 2004 elections regarding the influence of religion towards same-sex marriage initiatives.  At the time of its publication, a study presented by Gordon (2009) found that 41 states prohibited same-sex marriage.  In June 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in all states (Graham, 2015).  The 2016 Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates weighed in almost immediately with opposing views on the ruling (Kelly & Roller, 2015).  Republican support increased following the ruling due to political surveys demonstrating that 57% of American voters supported the ruling and 59% would accept it (Roller, 2015).  Most of the Republican presidential candidates at the time were vocally opposed to the ruling.    The perceived threat to heterosexual marriage often becomes a topic of debate used both politically and within the Christian Church (Sherkat et al., 2011).  Opponents to the movement advocated that gay and lesbian marriage was a threat to the institution of heterosexual marriage (Mucciaroni, 2008).  Some argued that heterosexual marriage was an exclusive privilege and should not be redefined to include same-sex couples.  At the height of the legal debate, most U.S. citizens who opposed the movement, believed that civil unions between same-sex couples were more acceptable than traditional marriage (Schmitt et al., 2007).    25 Once the gay rights movement gained a major win in the 2003 Lawrence ruling and later same-sex marriage became part of the conversation, doors opened for churches to explore the topic more in depth. In the next section I describe the historical background and progression of human sexuality policies and practices within Christian churches, including those in gay-embracing (Rainbow), gay-welcoming, and gay-exclusionary churches.  This section is the heart of my literature review as it reflects deeply on how the political history has shaped how churches respond and influence same sex relationships within the church walls and within society.  Church Debates on Human Sexuality: Membership, Marriage, and Ministry Many people view being part of the LGBTQ+ community and being a Christian as an incompatible relationship (Rodriguez, 2010).  The LGBTQ+ movement gained momentum and changes in the political climate led Christian churches to respond either positively or with additional resistance to the movement.  Wilcox (2007) claimed beginning as early as the 1960s and continuing through today, there has been an intertwining of sexuality, politics, and religion in public discourse.  Yet, the studies on human sexuality and religion are relatively new (Thumma & Gray, 2005).  The debate on human sexuality is one of the most contentious issues within the Christian Church today (Djupe, Olson, & Gilbert, 2006).  The shift in attention to politics has forced religions to grapple with sexuality within the church.  In the past 10-15 years, the push for Christian Churches to make public denominational statements regarding sexuality has escalated.  Sexuality and religion can become so engrained in a culture that it becomes difficult to study without gaining a full understanding of one without the other (Wilcox, 2007).  I explored the church’s response to the LGBTQ+ political movement in depth in the sections that follow.   26 Christian Church Influence on the Human Sexuality Debate  “It is usually assumed that being gay or lesbian and being Christian is contradictory” (Walton, 2006, p. 1).  Because of this belief, Christian church clergy play an influential role on their congregants’ response to concerns over human sexuality and even towards gay men and lesbians (Djupe et al., 2006).  News stories focusing on the debate over how LGBTQ+ Christians fit within the church can be found almost daily (Crary, 2019, Fitzsimons, 2019, Gold, 2019, Guerra, 2019 & Joe, 2019).  Most of these stories are not harmonious, yet groups of Christians supporting LGBTQ+ membership, marriage, and ministry are active and flourishing (Thumma & Gray, 2005).  The nature of the gay rights discussion can be very divisive within the church; church clergy may hesitate to seek a formal statement addressing the place for the LGBTQ+ community within the church (Djupe et al., 2006).  Determining whether to pursue a formal denominational human sexuality statement puts clergy at risk that the outcome of the statement might not align with their personal political views on gay and lesbian rights.      Activist groups have made attempts to work closely with Christian churches to bring the church and the LGBTQ+ community together (Rodriguez, 2010).  In 1999, 2000 LGBTQ+ members and allies met with 200 fundamentalists along with both a fundamentalist minister (Rev. Jerry Falwell) and gay minister (Rev. Mel White) with the goal of improving relationships between the Christian Church and the LGBTQ+ community.  The religious right protested the meeting.  The results of the meeting included a commitment from Rev. Falwell to diminish his anti-gay slogans.  Three years later the relations deteriorated when Rev. Falwell made claims that some of the LGBTQ+ participants in the original meeting had come forward to abandon their sexuality, which Rev. White claimed was Rev. Falwell’s original intent of the joint session.     In addition to the toll the topic of human sexuality may take on a church, there is often a  27 political dynamic that also comes into play.  The subject of human sexuality as addressed within the church causes internal strife between theological and political opinions (Djupe et al., 2006).    Church leaders in some denominations seek to influence the political climate as well.  The Religious Right, a well-known fundamentalist Christian group, exhibited strong anti-gay rights policies and dedicated time and resources to influence elections and court appointments (Hankins, 2009).   Many politically active Christians aggressively campaigned against lesbian and gay men full inclusion within the Christian Church (Kolden, 2005).  Prior to the adoption of the 2009 SSHS, the ELCA’s beliefs claimed that same gender relationships were immoral or sinful and that same gender marriages should not be blessed, and ordained ministers should not be called for those in long-term, same-gender relationships.  In 2002, the Task Force for ELCA Studies on Sexuality (Dart, 2005) was formed to lead a four-year study on human sexuality and prepare a human sexuality statement (“ELCA Boards Appoint,” 2002).  The purpose of the study was to make meaning of same gender relationships and the role of the church in ordaining ministers who are in same gender relationships as well as the church’s role in blessing same gender unions.     While recognizing that not all ELCA members could fully embrace same gender relationships, the ELCA’s Sexuality Task force planned to present their study’s early findings regarding human sexuality to the national assembly scheduled for August 2005 (Dart, 2005).  In its pre-assembly report from 2005, the Sexuality Task force recognized a strong difference of opinion in how the Bible addresses same gender intimacy.  Although disagreement was strong, and both sides remained unhappy, the final recommendation stated that the assembly should vote not to allow same gender unions and not to call pastors in long-term same gender relationships to be ordained.    28 The recommendation left the door slightly ajar for ordination.  Regional authorities were granted authority to provide permission to the calling of gay men or lesbian pastors (Dart, 2005).  Churches seeking to call gay men or lesbian pastors for the sake of ministerial outreach would not be disciplined or punished.  The task force also recognized that pastoral care may go beyond embracing gay men and lesbians as members.  Pastors should also provide unconditional pastoral support for same-gender couples.  The task force did, however, provide clear direction that this support did not also mean endorsement or full blessing of same gender relationships or unions.   In a 2005 journal publication, a theology professor from Minnesota published a declaration pleading with the ELCA to vote against ordination of ministers in long-term same gender relationships and to vote against allowing same gender weddings within the ELCA (Kolden, 2005).  Kolden’s article sought to support the then current ELCA policies by providing biblical context to the argument.  Kolden stated that although most churches accept those who are in same gender relationships as they would all sinners, acknowledging or blessing same gender unions goes against biblical teachings and that the institution of marriage must remain between a man and woman.  Church leaders often use biblical theology to advocate against the full acceptance and inclusion of LGBTQ+ members, ministers, and to reject same gender marriages or unions.  The recommendation to the ELCA consisted of a number of Bible verses utilized to encourage the vote against marriage and ordination for gay and lesbian members.   In 2009, the ELCA voted to change their policies regarding same-gender unions and ordination of ministers in long-term same gender relationships by approving the social statement on human sexuality (Mike, 2012).  Within the 2009 Human Sexuality Statement the ELCA recognized that many were divided on the issue of marriage and ordination of those in same  29 gender relationships.  The full recommendation of the sexuality statement allowed for discernment and interpretation by individual churches.   To summarize Chaplain Mike (2012) stated that the ELCA’s Statement on Human sexuality recognized four points related to member beliefs on human sexuality within the church: 1. Members may not be able to give up the notion that same-gender relationships are sinful. Pastors should support and care for those members as any others within their church. 2. Members may have strong beliefs that marriage should remain between a man and a woman and the church should recognize and support those members who many choose not to endorse or participate in same gender weddings.  3. Members may be convicted in their beliefs that the Bible does not address same-gender unions and that those relationships should be blessed and cared for but not considered a marriage which is reserved for a relationship between a man and a woman.  4. Members may believe that those in same gender relationships should be lived out in the same manner that heterosexual couples live out their unions and that they should be held to the same standard of pastoral care and community support as any other member of the congregation and to live in ways that glorify God with their lifelong partner. (Mike, 2012, para. 2-5)    Although the ELCA took a “vanilla” approach to the statement, the church-wide assembly voted in 2009 to allow members who were in same-gender, committed life-long, monogamous relationships to be ordained (Mike, 2012).  In that same assembly, the ELCA also voted to approve the allowance of ministers to host weddings of same-gender couples.  While the statement made it clear that no church was obligated to either call a minister in a same-gender relationship or to perform a same-gender union ceremony, their vote was not embraced by all members.  A significant number of ELCA members chose to leave and either join or form other groups because of the vote.      In 1972, The United Methodist Church (UMC) added language to the UMC Book of Discipline, which is considered the denomination’s book of policies and doctrines, that forbids ministers to perform same gender weddings and requires celibacy for non-heterosexual ministers  30 (Udis-Kessler, 2003).  In addition, funding any program that supports LGBTQ+ advocacy is forbidden.  The UMC is the second largest Protestant denomination, (“Fifteen Largest,” 2015) claiming nearly seven million members, in the United States (Crary, 2019).  In February 2019, the UMC held a special conference in St. Louis where delegates voted 438-384 to prohibit bishops from ordaining “self-avowed homosexuals” (Crary, 2019, p. 1) and to suspend minsters without pay who perform same-gender unions.  The special assembly voted both to uphold current policies against same-gender weddings and ordinations, as well as increase the severity of punishment against those who break from UMC doctrine (Nichols, 2019).  According to Crary (2019), a nine-member judicial council within the UMC upheld the majority of the plan in April 2019.  The plan was scheduled to become active on January 1, 2020 (Guerry, 2019).   Some United Methodist Church leaders chose to remain within the UMC to continue to fight for change within the church.  One gay pastor in Michigan who hoped to marry someone of the same gender upon retirement took the vow of celibacy within the church to remain as a Christian Church leader and continued to advocate for change (Nichols, 2019).  Although the church is split on whether to stay and fight for change or to separate off and form other groups, progressive leaders appear to be advocating members who support the LGBTQ+ community to remain within the church and press for change.  JJ Warren, a current student seeking ordination, spoke at the conference and recently shared the following thoughts “What I’m encouraging people to do is stay the course, because we’re sharing our stories, we’re no longer issues right? We’re people” (Nichols, 2019, p. 1).     In June of 2019, the Dakota Conference of the UMC, which is made up of members from 245 congregations in both North and South Dakota, passed a vote with 62% approval to contest the bans on same-sex marriage and LGBQ+ pastor ordination in the UMC (Guerry, 2019).   31 Although gay-friendly churches welcome LGBTQ+ members, they tend to avoid addressing the topic of sexuality (Rodriguez & Oulette, 2000).  Pastors and members have recently established gay-embracing churches to merge the need to share both gay and Christian positive messages.   Gay Embracing (Rainbow) Church    A growing number of religious support groups have been working tirelessly to open the doors of churches to LGBQ+ individuals by providing both gay and Christian positive messages (Rodriguez, 2010).  Churches that specifically invite the LGBQ+ community to call their church home are considered gay-embracing churches.  Several of my participants referred to churches they had attended as Rainbow churches. I adopted this term and used it interchangeably with gay-embracing in response to the participants regular use of this term.  Rainbow churches share interpretations of the Bible that focus on God’s love of all people and preach messages of hope for the LGBTQ+ community (Rodriguez & Ouellette, 2000).   In 1968, the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) was established connecting human rights with the Christian Church, and later became the first church to perform same-gender weddings (“About Metropolitan Community Churches (MCC),” n.d).  In 2019, the South Dakota Synod ELCA established a call to be more welcoming to the LGBTQ+ community and as a result, Pastors walked in the first ever Sioux Falls Pride Parade.  Figure 2 illustrates an ELCA Pastor and his wife after walking in the parade in Sioux Falls, SD, June 15, 2019.           32 Figure 2 Photo at Community’s First Ever Pride Parade 2019  The Church of the Village in New York City hosted services performed by the MCC and was the original home of PFLAG (a support group for parents and families of LGBTQ+ individuals; Louis, 2019). According to Louis (2019), the Church of the Village has embraced the LGBTQ+ community since the early 1970s.  In 1992, the church held the funeral of Marsha P. Johnson who paved the way for transgender advocacy by co-founding the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) and establishing (along with Sylvia Rivera) the STAR House, considered the first home for transgender youth.  Jeff Wells, lead pastor explained the purpose of the Church of the Village:  We provide just general support for all our members.  So pastoral care and counseling, you know, spiritual growth and you know the fact that we are welcoming of everyone but especially affirming of people who are considered to be on the margins or oppressed.  We incorporate that ethos into everything that we do so in our worship, we continually lift up people of color and L.G.B.T.Q persons.  We call ourselves a radically inclusive congregation. (Louis, 2019, p. 7)    In 2015, Colin Collette and Jull Piccolino established an alternative Catholic Church near Chicago, Illinois (Susnjara, 2019).  The church started in a basement after Collette was fired as a  33 music director because of his sexuality. The church’s intent was to remain faithful to the Catholic Tradition, while emphasizing that the definition of being Catholic is to be inclusive of all.    Gay-Exclusionary Churches  Gay-exclusionary churches may take an extreme stance against gay men and lesbian inclusion in the church.  Some churches require LGBTQ+ members to attend conversion therapy to rid themselves of the desire for sex and reorient their sexual identities (Wolkomir, 2006).  Conversion therapy, also referred to as reparative therapy, is still legal for minors in many states (Fadel, 2019).  Companies, such as Exodus International, offered conversion therapy with a claim to help Christians relieve themselves of their unwanted same-sex desires (Wolkomir, 2006).  The American Psychological Association denounced the practice of conversion therapy in a published report in 2009 (Gold, 2019).  Indeed, medical professionals stated that the practice was traumatizing to minors.  Due to its harmful effects, 16 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico currently banned conversion therapy (Fadel, 2019).  New York (Gold, 2019) and Massachusetts (Fitzsimons, 2019) joined the ban in January and April of 2019.    Many LGBTQ+ Christians also experience a sense of loss or abandonment in relationships when they come out and their church is not supportive of their sexuality (Beagan & Hattie, 2016).  Examples of such losses may include their social networks (youth groups, choir, committees, etc.), friends, family, and even their relationship with God.  According to participants in Beagan and Hattie’s study, it is a challenge to replace the deep connection they experienced with their church.  Self-esteem may also take a direct hit when LGBTQ+ people hear consistent messages condemning their sexuality or telling them to cleanse their impure thoughts, causing extreme depression and thoughts of suicide.   34 Identity Conflicts between Spirituality and Sexuality  Because most mainstream Christian denominations are still wrestling with how to approach policies regarding same-gender relationships, LGBTQ+ individuals often struggle with how to reconcile their sexuality and their spirituality (Yip, 2005).  In a study conducted by Breagan and Hattie (2016), LGBTQ+ people who were raised as Christians experienced painful struggles between their sexuality and spirituality and felt deep shame and guilt and described their sexuality as something “dirty” due to the anti-gay messages delivered in church.  The message from the pulpit was that because of their sexuality, they are going to hell because of their sexual sins (Breagan & Hattie, 2016).  Participants in Breagan and Hattie’s study also stated that in general the church message was “sex-negative” (p. 100) but that same-gender sex was doubly sinful.  Participants described delaying sex until much later in life and often struggled with guilt and shame for sexual attraction.    The 50th Anniversary of the Stonewall Inn Riots in 2019 marked a year of milestones in celebration of progress of the gay rights movement.  I highlighted some of those in the section that follows.  Recent Milestones   The year 2019 was a noteworthy year in the progress of the LGBTQ+ movement.  Celebrations throughout the United States took place throughout the entire month of June 2019, marking the 50th Anniversary of the Stonewall Inn Riots (A list of Pride, 2019).  For the first time in history, New York City (home of the Stonewall Inn) hosted World Pride in June of 2019 (Swenson & Peltz, 2019).  World Pride kicked off with an opening ceremony on June 26th, 2019, and followed with several key events, such as the Stonewall 50, Pride Island Music Festival, and a World Pride Parade (Celebrate World Pride, 2019).  Prior to the celebrations, the  35 Human Rights conference gathered LGBTA+ activists and other key individuals from around the world to focus on key issues.  Sessions were held over two days on topics such as Allyship with Black and Brown LGBTQ+ groups, Global LGBTQ+ rights, and Faith and Sexuality, with a focus on addressing exclusion (Human Rights Conference, 2019). On June 29th, 2019, an alternative Catholic Church in Palatine, IL opened its doors to host a Pride mass for the LGBTQ+ community and their allies, friends, and family members (Susnjara, 2019).   Summary The LGBTQ+ movement has made significant progress in the past fifty years since the Stonewall Riots of June 1969.  Same-sex marriage rights led some churches from the message of “love the sinner, hate the sin” to presiding over gay and lesbian unions.  While progress is being made in many cultural settings, the place for the LGBTQ+ community in the church still poses a significant dilemma.  I used analytical theory to diagnose the challenges LGBTQ+ members face when encountering people within the Christian Church and how these experiences impacted them.   Theoretical Literature  Analytical theory helps guide and organize the data gathered and helps illuminate concepts that might not otherwise appear in your analysis (Bickman, 2009).  Analytical theory is a valuable tool used to better comprehend the concepts which drive the experiences of the subjects.  Theories stemming from quantitative research may not adequately solve for the lived experiences of participants in a qualitative study (Creswell, 2018).  I analyzed the challenges LGBTQ+ individuals faced when reconciling their faith with their sexuality through a theoretical lens.  In this study, I reviewed multiple theories that may provide insight as to how the church’s stance on sexuality affects members who identify as LGBTQ+.    36 I adopted two theories to analyze the experiences of gay men and lesbians in the Christian Church.  The purpose of my theoretical analysis was to understand what roles these theories play when sexuality and spirituality intersect.  I selected social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) because my goal was to understand what happens when one’s identity as part of one group collides with the expectations held by another one of their social identities.  I then studied unconscious bias theory (Banaji, 2013) for the role it plays in how even the subtle encounters with Christians who proclaim to “love the sinner” can be harmful for a gay man or a lesbian who seek to be fully embraced by the Christian Church.  These stories analyzed through social, gender, and stereotype related theories contribute to the main concern regarding spirituality and sexuality.   Social Identity Theory British social psychologists Henri Tajfel, John Turner, and colleagues developed social identity theory (SIT) in 1979. SIT explains the relationship between personal and social identities (Ellemers, 2017; Huddy, 2001). One study examined what it means to take on the role of a member of a group and the role group dynamics play in social situations (Ellemers, 2017).  While a case has been made for merging identity theory with social identity theory, there are some differences.  Identity theory emphasizes the role of the individual, whereas social identity theory focuses on the membership or participation in a group (Stets & Burke, 2000).  Identity theory states that individuals categorize themselves into roles they identify with and establish behaviors that fit those roles (Tajfel & Turner, 1979).  While both identity theory and social identity theories are likely to emerge during this study, for the purpose of this theoretical review, I evaluated the social identities of the participants as part of the LGBTQ+ community and as past or present participants in a Christian church.  I also took note of the gaps identified in my study  37 as part of SIT and I assessed what emerges when the participants shared the choices they made and how they assessed their options as part of their encounters with the Christian Church.  Having a social identity occurs when someone is a member of a group and shares the beliefs or practices within that group (Stets & Burke, 2000).  Individuals construct their own experiences by establishing their social identities and choosing their ingroups (Punt, 2011).  Members take on the social norms of their group and behave according to the group dynamic.  An individual’s social identity is developed through a merger of three related processes: “social categorization,” “social identification,” and “social comparison” (Ellemers, 2017, para. 10).  Social categorization demonstrates the view that someone is part of a variety of groups, rather than seen as an individual.  Social identification explains the idea that people identify themselves as part of a group rather than as a bystander.  Finally, social comparison reveals ranks within social groups according to a social standard.   The separation of ingroups and outgroups based on differences can lead to a power dynamic with one group holding a real or perceived dominance over the other (Punt, 2011).  Participants in the social group exhibit favoritism towards members within their ingroup (Hawley, Hosch, & Bovaird, 2014).  Often one’s self-esteem is lifted by the positive reinforcement of the similarities they share with their ingroup, and in contrast with the shared negative perception of the contrasting outgroup (Stets & Burke, 2000).  Group status also plays a role in one’s connection to their ingroup or outgroup.  Social identities solidify as part of a higher status group but may struggle to develop within a lower status group (Huddy, 2001).  This could be because members within a lower status group may take action to enhance their group standing, an example of this is while recognizing the challenges of the ingroup they may draw attention to the negative attributes of the outgroup.     38   Members of a disadvantaged ingroup may respond in one of three ways: (1) they may choose to accept the position of the group and their role within it, (2) they may take action to move up to an advantaged group, or (3) they may challenge the group to work together to elevate the ingroup’s status (Taylor, Moghaddam, Gamble, & Zellerer, 1987).  Current SIT studies do not address how or why individuals follow any of those three paths.  I look further at the variances between ingroup and outgroup relationships in the subset of social identity theory that follows.  Ingroup/Outgroup Bias   People hold memberships in a variety of groups and work to maintain the positive associations they feel within that group and protect the image outsiders may have of that group (Hawley et al., 2014).  This may lead to favoritism shown towards ingroup members, even if those members make decisions which negatively impact the group.  A cross-over effect can also occur between rival ingroup and outgroup members.  Members of the outgroup who deviate from the practices of that group may find themselves in favor with the ingroup because their actions align with the beliefs or practices of the ingroup instead (Abrams et al., 2014).  According to Malina and Neyrey (as cited in Punt, 2011, p. 3), “In-group members are treated with loyalty, openness, allegiance and support.  Those falling outside the in-group boundaries belong to the out-group, dealings are indifferent, even hostile.”  There is a gap in what social identity theorists have studied regarding how or why members within a group respond to a shift in the circumstances of the groups in which they belong (Taylor et al., 1987).  According to Huddy (2001), one of the challenges in SIT is the omittance of choice.  This will be an important factor in my study as Christian Church membership and participation are choices where human sexuality is not.  That said, some Christian Churches claim that acting upon one’s sexuality is a choice and may even require one  39 to choose between their church membership, participation, or leadership roles over their sexuality. Religion and Social Identity As I studied the gay men and lesbian experiences within a Christian church, it was important to understand the role that hermeneutics played in social identity.  Theorists claimed that there is an openness in interpretations of texts and of one another (Warnke, 2014).  Warnke (2014) further explained that while interpretations of texts remain open, they may be discriminatory.  How those interpretations factor into the social identities of gay men and lesbians in the Christian Church helped to shed light on the meaning one makes of those experiences.    The interpretations of Biblical texts are often used in the case against gay men or lesbian inclusion in the Christian Church.  Interpreting text can lead to a “hermeneutic circle” (Warnke, 2014, p. 577).  The hermeneutic circle occurs when a text is challenging to interpret so one digs deeper into the text to try to understand the context, while trying to mold the text to their understandings.  Warnke (2014) further explained the hermeneutic circle as reaching full understanding of the text and translating that understanding into meaning.  Warnke claims that individuals fail to understand identities when they use historical texts (in this case the Christian Bible) to shape their view of social identities.  A shift in hermeneutics is occurring, resulting in a struggle for interpretation.  Revisionists are challenging interpretations, opening avenues for a shift in identity whereas absolutists are holding on to original interpretations of the text (Punt, 2011).  Hermeneutics can lead institutions to take on prejudices, which require participants within them to take on a social identity that does not align with their personal identity (Warnke, 2014).  An example of this could mean that a gay man or a lesbian feels the need to assimilate to a heterosexual person within the Christian Church.   40 Political Identity The surge in groups seeking recognition on a political scale call for a focus on theories tied to identity and politics (Huddy, 2001).  Earlier studies of social identity are somewhat flawed in their affiliation to political identity due to lack of specific political focus, particularly in studying social identity within the complexities of historic and cultural surroundings.  One key element of political identity research relevant to this study is the controversial meaning that some US citizens believe that to be a “True American” you must believe in a Christian God (Citrin, Reingold, & Green, 1990).  Sears and Citrin (as cited in Huddy, 2001) claimed that members who are part of a minority group identify first with their US identity and their minority identity falls secondary which contradicts the work of social identity theorists.   Huddy (2001) encouraged resolution of several key issues before social identity can be truly tied to political identities.  One example provided by Huddy stated that not all US citizens view their identity as a US citizen through the same lens and strong ethnic or racial identities may underscore an individual’s national identity.  Huddy declared that one of the gaps identified in using social identity theory to dissect political identities is that social identities have not been studied for how they hold up over time and under varying circumstances.  Individuals crave positive recognition, therefore when they experience negative or in some cases misrecognition it can inflict suffering on the member (Taylor, 1994).  These connections and flaws were important to evaluate as part of my study on how gay and lesbian people experienced the Christian Church.   Group members can face threats to their identity within the group.  When a group’s status is jeopardized due to devaluation of the group or negative moral behavior, group status threat transpires (Ellemers, 2017).  Group members may respond differently to the different types of threats to themselves as members or their groups status.  Members who take their transgressions  41 too far may find themselves ousted by their ingroup.  I explored that experience briefly in the next section. “Black” Sheep Effect Members of the ingroup often have a powerful connection and are passionate about the success of their group (Abrams, Palmer, Rutland, Cameron, & Vyver, 2014).  Members of the ingroup who more frequently adhere to the practices of the group may encounter approval over those who deviate from the social norms of the group.  Biases can be expressed with either a negative or positive response to members within the same group.  Powerful connections to the group could lead to members taking a harsher stance against members who bring negative consequences to the ingroup based on their behaviors (Hawley et al., 2014).  Members will prompt a more extreme evaluation of their likeability or unlikability from members of their ingroup than from the outgroup (Marques et al., 1988).  For example, members who stray from the practices of the ingroup may be on the receiving end of harsher criticism than someone who might elicit the same behavior in the outgroup (Abrams et al., 2014).  Offending members may then find themselves ousted by their group.  This experience is known as the black sheep effect (BSE; Hawley et al., 2014).   Whether the group favors the deviant member’s actions or takes a harsh stance against them has more to do with context and the behavior itself than it does with the individual (Hawley et al., 2014).  Beyond deviance from the ingroup, members may be a part of a group that hosts practices that conflict with the identity of the member.  Members who justify those conflicting practices for a variety of reasons participate in what is known as system justification theory (SJT).  I explored SJT in the next segment.     42 System Justification Theory   Scholars consider system justification theory to be a neighboring theory to social identity theory (as well as other social theories) in that people respond with bias according to their social networks (Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004).  Jost (2001) considered social identity theory a precursor to system justification theory.  To better understand the connections between social identity theory and system justification theory, it is important to explore the similarities as well as the key differences.   There are at several connections between social identity theory and system justification theory. According to Jost (2001), social identity theory sheds light on the social-psychological link between ingroup and outgroup relationships.  Finally, social groups tend to justify their legitimacy either by dominance or acceptance of stereotypes within the disadvantaged group as part of their identification as part of the in-group or out-group.  According to a study conducted by Jost et al. (2004) some of those contrasts include the following:  a) There is an ideological motive to justify the existing social order  b) The motive is at least partially responsible for outgroup favoritism and the internalization of inferiority among members of disadvantaged groups  c) It is observed most readily at an implicit, nonconscious level of awareness and  d) Paradoxically, it is sometimes strongest among those who are most disadvantaged by the social order. (p. 912)  System justification theory proposes that members with a personal investment in a social system may experience conflict with their personal identity.    There may be a personal discord between an individual’s personal belief system and their social interests (Moss, 2016).  Individuals begin to justify the system they belong to even if disparate, because they believe overall that the universe is fair and just (Blasi & Jost, 2006).   The stereotyping of disadvantaged groups leads to the justification of inequalities for the disadvantaged groups (Jost, 2001).  This results in a desire for participants to defend and justify  43 their social group’s practices even if they personally are disadvantaged by those practices (Blasi & Jost, 2006).  As a result, they begin to legitimize their place of inequality within their group even if that means they are negatively impacted by that inequality (Blanchar & Eidelman, 2013).  One reason for this type of behavior can be linked to the desire for someone of a disadvantaged group to be a part of something higher than themselves (Blasi & Jost, 2006).  As it relates to this study, this could mean that someone’s sexuality could conflict with their membership in a Christian Church but their desire to be a part of something bigger than themselves could cause them to justify the Christian Church’s position on homosexuality.  Relationships are challenged when someone’s desire to be a part of the social network (i.e., a Christian Church) conflicts with their (sexual) identity (Jost et al., 2004).     People look to other institutions to provide stability, particularly if one system seems to be unstable (Moss, 2016).  An example of this related to this study meant that if someone was struggling with their place in the LGBTQ+ community, they sought solace in a spiritual group.  Or on the flip side, if because of their sexuality, their place in a Christian church feels unstable, they may solidify their place within the LGBTQ+ community.  System justification falters when individuals believe they can change the system they belong to.  The church’s denomination could play a role in whether a gay man or a lesbian feels the need to justify the stance the church takes on their sexuality or if they believe they can influence change within the Christian Church.    Duration of existence may also play a role in system justification.  According to a study conducted by Blanchar and Eidelman (2013), time in existence or longevity of the system perpetuates justification for continuation of the practices performed in the church.  People feel the need to connect to long standing traditions and beliefs, and they tend to justify the inadequacies that conflict with their personal identities.  System justification takes place  44 regardless of status within the group, meaning both advantaged and disadvantaged members participate (Blasi & Just, 2006).  While similarities exist between system justification theory and other social identity theories, it was important to understand the differences as well as what role each plays in how gay and lesbian people responded to their experiences in the Christian Church.  Key differences to watch out for include: (1) Do members of the ingroup (the LGBTQ+ community or the Christian Church) justify the biases of the group, and if so, why? (2) Do members who perceive themselves as disadvantaged respond with outgroup favoritism? and (3) Are the biases held by the members implicit or unconscious?  System justification theory also bridges a connection to ingroup and outgroup biases which I explore in the next section as part of unconscious bias theory.   Unconscious Bias Theory Unconscious bias theory describes how individuals store hidden bits of knowledge about social groups in their brains that appear without conscious awareness when they encounter others (Banaji & Greenwald, 2013).  When individuals encounter another person, their brains respond by quickly assessing the person and making immediate judgements that they may not even be aware of (Herbert, 2013).  These rapid judgments often come without taking the time to fully understand the individual or assess the context or timing of the encounter (Sporek, 2015).  Eberhardt (2019) stated: “Implicit bias is a kind of distorting lens that’s a product of both the architecture of our brain and the disparities in our society” (2019, p.13).  Even the most progressive and open-minded individuals have implicit biases, despite deliberate and conscious efforts to overcome them. These unconscious or implicit biases develop over time based on experiences and cultural environment and people are likely to not be aware of them (Herbert,  45 2013).  Although the terms unconscious and illicit are used interchangeably throughout the literature, for consistency, I use “unconscious” for the remainder of this study unless quoted by others.   Individuals learn to associate or categorize people based on a variety of factors that are in place early on in life (Kite et al., 2017).  Schools, peer groups, family and the media are a few examples of influence in how individuals develop biases.  These experiences may lead individuals to treat people differently and make decisions that impact them without their awareness (Sporek, 2015).  People may not even think they believe in a particular stereotype, but they may respond implicitly (Kite et al., 2017).  When individuals encounter others, they tend to categorize them and sort them into groups (Tajfel & Turner, 1979).  These unconscious responses may occur even when the individual’s outward desire is to generate a positive response towards individuals who are part of a marginalized group (Smith, 2008).  Individuals may try to oppress their biases to meet social expectations, but they may manifest without their conscious recognition (Smith, 2008).  Individuals who grew up in a culture of negative biases but outwardly reject those biases, may still host an unconscious bias based on their historical context (Clark & Zygmunt, 2014).      While categorization may be a convenient method for assessing others, it poses the risk of forming biases (conscious or unconscious) and may lead to stereotyping (Sporek, 2015).    Using unconscious bias theory helped to analyze what happens when an LGBQ+ individual encounters someone in the Christian Church who may have unconscious biases about spirituality and sexuality.  By understanding the role unconscious biases play in our encounters and by understanding the social harms they may cause, we open the lens to better understanding how to  46 overcome them (Eberhardt, 2019).  Depending upon the type of church gay men or lesbian individuals encounter, they may be the recipient of a variety of unconscious biases.   Unconscious biases are difficult to both control and change (Lemm, 2006).  Even people who are committed to opposing prejudice against the LGBTQ+ community may host some unconscious biases that they cannot readily control.  Haldeman (2004) provided an example of how gay-exclusionary pastors may outwardly welcome a gay man or a lesbian member but inwardly expect their gay man or lesbian congregant to set aside their same sex desires.  That same gay man or lesbian member may then encounter someone within the LGBTQ+ community who has a negative bias to their spirituality.  Both encounters likely influence the LGBTQ+ members within the Christian Church.  Unconscious Bias in Social Networks   People identify themselves either as part of or on the outside of groups (Smith, 2008).  Studies have demonstrated that the more contact someone has with a group such as the LGBTQ+ community, the more likely they are to have favorable unconscious biases towards the people of that group, and the closer the relationship, the more favorable the response (Lemm, 2006).  Individuals who have had positive or close relationships with LGBTQ+ people may have favorable biases towards other gay men and/or lesbians.  That said, people who claim to reject anti-gay biases, may still host a negative unconscious bias.   Additionally, according to a study conducted by Lemm (2006), another important factor to consider when understanding unconscious bias as it relates to people who are motivated to reject anti-gay biases, is the motivation for their conscious decision needs to be personal and not social.  The ability to choose to treat LGBTQ+ members without bias may be more difficult due to the unconscious analysis of the people individuals are encountering.    47 Lemm (2006) found that the desire to be politically correct to meet the social standards of one’s culture is not enough to overcome unconscious biases.  Instead of behaving with a conscious bias, individuals may start to suppress those biases leading to a later unconscious response (Smith, 2008).  To eliminate or reduce outward prejudiced responses, the host must have a desire to change and have previous positive encounters with someone in the outgroup (Lemm, 2006).  It is also important to understand the differences in how men verses women show their unconscious biases towards the LGBTQ+ community.  According to Kite and Whitley (1996), men are significantly more inclined to demonstrate anti-gay biases.   Unconscious Bias and Gender “The subtle influence of sex upon a person’s perceptions may vary with each observer and play both an unconscious and conscious role in influencing actions taken (Hopkins v. Price, 1990, para. 22).  In a gender discrimination case in 1990, Judge Gesell used these words to support his decision to award partnership to a woman who was the victim of gender discrimination in the workplace (Kite et al., 2017).  According to Kite et al. (2017), this court case is an early representation of recognition towards gender bias and may be responsible for encouraging more research on gender bias issues.   There are key drivers of how unconscious biases influences actions or how individuals can try to negate their biases (Kite, 1996).  Gender appears to play a role in unconscious biases as well.  Kite said men tend to have more anti-gay bias, especially towards other men, than women do.  According to Deaux and Lewis (1984), men tend to expect other men to have more stereotypical masculine traits.  There is a set of gender specific expectations that occur when people encounter others (Kite et al., 2017).  Men who encounter other men who have more feminine traits and play a more feminine role may respond with biases against them (Deaux &  48 Lewis, 1984).  On the other end of the spectrum, both women and men tend to have less of a bias towards lesbians (Lemm, 2006).  Although there tends to be differences in how men and women respond to an LGBTQ+ person if that person is a man, progress has been made when it comes to equality for the LGBTQ+ community.  Lemm (2006) claimed that both men and women have similar views towards LGBTQ+ equality as a civil rights concern.  There is a gap in the research of specific data to demonstrate if those same equal rights views carry over from heterosexual Christians towards LGBTQ+ membership within the Christian Church. Stereotype Threat Theory  I recognized earlier the role that stereotyping may play in system justification.  A somewhat contradictory perspective occurs when the disadvantaged member of a group perceives the stereotype as a threat to themselves, or the group they are a part of (Steele & Aronson, 1995).  According to stereotype threat theory, when a person is consistently treated differently based on the biases of others, they develop fears of validating that stereotype (Roger & Aronson, 2009).  The recipient develops a fear that they may represent the negative traits perceived by those with the bias (Shapiro, 2012).  Taking that a step further, when someone is part of a group that is typically perceived with negative biases or stereotypes, they develop a fear of taking on those negative traits and causing a negative perception of themselves as an individual or of reinforcing those negative traits for their group (Steele & Aronson, 1995).   For example, if a boss believes that a man who shows more emotion than expected of a typical man stereotype, they may not think an emotional man would be able to handle a leadership position and the boss does not provide additional responsibilities to the emotional person.  The employee may then start to believe they are not cut out for the job and begin underperforming, which then leads to reinforcement of the original stereotype.  This is known as  49 stereotype threat theory (Steele, 1997), which details how when someone starts to believe in the stereotypes placed on their in-group, they begin to behave in such a way that reinforces the stereotype, creating an infinite loop.   Group Concept Threat There are several sub-threats within stereotype threat theory in which one’s fears of living up to a negative stereotype may manifest itself.  For example, if someone within the LGBTQ+ community fears that their community is truly undeserving of being valued as Christians, they may believe that if they are in a same-sex relationship, that they are reinforcing the negative stereotypes that some heterosexual Christians place on LGBTQ+ people.  Group-concept threat is considered the type of stereotype threat where one perceives their group (in this case the LGBTQ+ community) as the target and themselves as a gay Christian as the source of that threat (Shapiro, 2012).   Own-Reputation Threat  When someone establishes a fear that others may identify them as part of the out-group (in this case LGBTQ+ community) they experience “Own-Reputation Threat” (Shapiro, 2012, p. 75).  An example of where this could occur within a Christian church might be if a gay man or a lesbian, who was raised as a Christian or who seeks to join a Christian Church, is currently not out as a gay man or lesbian.  The gay or lesbian Christian may fear that their sexuality will be discovered, and their church will turn on them or that they would be devalued as a Christian because of their sexuality.   Group-Reputation Threat Finally, group-reputation threat can also play a role.  According to Shapiro (2012), group-reputation threat can occur when someone fears their personal behavior may reflect poorly on the  50 group they belong to.  In the case of a gay Christian, this could manifest when a person believes that if their same-sex relationship is discovered, it will reinforce any negative views that heterosexual Christians may have about the LGBTQ+ community.  For own-reputation threat or group-reputation threat to manifest, the LGBTQ+ member must perceive that their sexuality can be identified by the heterosexual members of the church (Shapiro, 2012) Responses to Stereotype Threats Members of the targeted group may take on coping strategies to combat stereotype threats.  They may begin to disassociate themselves as members of the targeted group, either by keeping their identity a secret, or not actively participating in the targeted group (Shapiro, 2012).  For those who experience own-reputation threat, they may seek one of two paths.  In one case, they may decide to distance themselves from their stereotyped group (at least publicly) to remain in favor with the main group.  Or on the other path, they may draw themselves further into the stereotyped group and leave the main group to gain support from those who share their experiences.  For example, a LGBTQ+ person may remain celibate or keep their relationships a secret, to please heterosexual members of their church, or they may remove themselves from the church and draw upon the support of the LGBTQ+ community.  It is also possible that gay men or lesbian Christians struggle to maintain their relationships within the LGBTQ+ community because of the perceived stereotypes of heterosexual Christians.  My study analyzed these biases and threats and the roles they played in how heterosexual Christian church members respond to LGBTQ+ members.  The study also examined how those biases and threats influenced the experiences of gay and lesbian people in a Christian Church.         51 Summary The encounters that LGBTQ+ members face when experiencing Christian Church membership are often challenged by their social identities.  Christian Church members may not always be aware of the biases they hold towards the LGBTQ+ community, which may influence how they respond to gay and lesbian persons who seek membership and leadership roles within the church.  In the following chapter, I specified my methodology for conducting this study and explained my reasons for selecting a qualitative study using narrative inquiry to make meaning of the experiences of gay men and lesbians in a Christian Church.    52 CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY “Good research begins with an issue or a problem that needs to be resolved” (Wertz, 2011, p. 130).  This chapter focuses on the methodology I used to conduct my study on how Christian Church policies and practices concerning human sexuality affect the experiences and faith journeys of gay men and lesbians.     Two major Christian Church denominations voted during the last decade on policies and practices that impact the experiences of their LGBTQ+ members (Brooks, 2009; Iovino, 2019).  Those decisions likely had an important influence on the gay men and lesbian members of their churches.  The struggle between spirituality and sexuality can best be shared via the stories of those who have experienced it.  My study’s purpose was to provide valuable insights into what happens to gay men and lesbians in a church when decisions are made by the church regarding sexuality.     Qualitative research provides valuable insights into a problem through the lens of the participants (Creswell & Poth, 2018).  Collecting thorough details from the participants about their experiences provided insight into the root of the problems stemming from policies regarding sexuality in the church.  Hearing their narratives helped to uplift the voices of gay and lesbian people by highlighting their stories on how they have been impacted by the church.  I used qualitative research methods with a specific method of narrative inquiry to hear stories from gay men and lesbian church members with an emphasis on gay-friendly and gay-exclusionary Christian congregations.  Narrative inquiry uses personal narratives and stories of the participants.  The narrative inquiry analysis guided the research to find meaning in the experiences of the participants through the complexities of their emotions, perceptions, and definitions in response to those experiences (Kim, 2016). The qualitative research approach  53 guided my data collection on the background, context, and analysis required to better understand the participant’s stories.  The focal point of my study surrounded the following question:  1. How do Christian Church doctrines, policies, and practices concerning the expressions of identity and human sexuality affect the experiences and faith journeys of gay men and lesbians?  Additionally, I sought to understand the following:  1. How did lesbians and gay men make sense of their experiences within a Christian church?  2. How did the experiences of lesbians and gay men as current or former church members affect their views of Christianity and/or Christian churches?   3. How did the experiences of lesbians and gay men in Christian churches affect their relationship within the LGBTQ+ community or the reverse?  I selected qualitative research to gain a deeper understanding as to why gay men and lesbian members chose to either stay or leave a Christian church when their sexuality came into conflict with church policies and practices.  It was important to study more than the numbers and the statistics to get to the heart of the issue.  A qualitative method allowed me to hear the personal narratives and use their stories to guide my analysis.    This chapter provides a detailed explanation regarding qualitative research methods I adopted and more specifically narrative inquiry within the qualitative research tradition. I also described participant selection, data gathering, and data analysis.  I concluded this section with a description of how I addressed any ethical considerations, including anonymity and  54 confidentiality for an at-risk population, and finally I called attention to the limitations of the study.  Research Design Qualitative Research I chose qualitative research because understanding the experiences of gay men and lesbians in a Christian church requires a deeper understanding of what those experiences meant to the participants.  I could not gain this same meaning and understanding from a quantitative study.  Qualitative research uses words rather than numbers to interpret human behavior and avoids focusing on predictions, measurements, and controls (Kim, 2016).  Qualitative research uncovers the meaning participants find in facing a problem or an issue (Creswell & Poth, 2018).  Qualitative research is best used when the researcher needs to view an issue through a multifaceted, complex narrative that is difficult to measure.  Taking a qualitative approach to my study allowed me to provide deeper insight into the experiences of my participants.     Two key elements are required to drive a solid qualitative study: sharing the personal experiences with the topic being explored and evaluating how those experiences shape the interpretation of the phenomenon (Wertz, 2011).  Churches which have changed or updated their policies and practices on human sexuality, as well as those who avoid addressing the topic all together face unintended consequences of those actions.  Qualitative research is exponentially helpful in raising those consequences to the surface (Patton, 2015).  The narratives of people who have made faith decisions based on the church’s response to their sexuality, added meaningful value to the research.  This approach allowed for a more creative, innovative interviewing and writing style.      Sharing the experiences of the participants within the study may have held some appeal  55 for transformative readers and writers.  Transformative researchers hope to challenge oppressors, enhance the lives of those oppressed, and/or challenge institutions to make positive change because of their research (Creswell & Poth, 2018).  Participants’ stories provided valuable insight into their decisions on whether to continue participating in a faith journey.  This study may cause Christian churches to review policies and practices which intentionally or subconsciously oppress gay and lesbian members and inspire positive change.  My aim in part of the study was to understand the role sexuality plays in a gay man or lesbian’s faith development and the meaning they assign to their encounters with the church regarding sexuality.  It was fundamental to this type of work to immerse myself completely into the experiences of my participants.  The words of Wertz (2011) demonstrated the extent researchers must take to fully flush out the nature and meaning of participant experience: “I (Wertz) experience research as a form of love in which I immerse myself in other people’s lives” (p. 158).  This is not something you can obtain through a quantitative study.     Two major Christian denominations addressed human sexuality within the last two decades.  It became important to understand how those changes impacted participants.  I narrowed my focus to include gay men and lesbian members of gay-friendly and gay-exclusionary churches.  Participants also shared experiences and their thoughts on what it was like to attend a “Rainbow church.”  I used the term “Rainbow church” throughout this study to describe churches that are gay embracing or gay celebratory - more than one participant used this term to describe the type of church that centered around their LGBTQ+ members.   I selected narrative inquiry with the qualitative research tradition because of its emphasis on telling the stories of the participants affected by a church in conflict on the topic of sexuality (Kim, 2016).  Because these experiences were individual and based on the culture of the church  56 they attended, highlighting their stories provided me with deep insight into their experiences. In the next section, I described the underlying premises of narrative inquiry and its value in helping me address the research question. Narrative Inquiry People find meaning within their life stories (Wertz, 2011).  They use storytelling to deal with social challenges and to make meaning of the experiences they encounter (Dauite, 2014).  I used individual’s stories to analyze how their experiences influenced their decisions.  Narrative inquiry demonstrates the ability to make meaning of human responses to life experiences, society, and cultural environments (Kim, 2016).  Using narrative inquiry for this study meant that by telling participant’s stories, I had an advantage of hearing a more thoughtfully composed and unified narrative rather than hearing pieces and fragments (Wertz, 2011).      Each participant has a different response to their experiences.  Participants revealed their interpretations of the experiences through how they chose to respond to the church and its members when their sexuality came in conflict with the church.  Kim (2016) declared that individuals use stories to make meaning of their own experiences; narrative inquiry helps researchers to use the same approach to making meaning of how others experience the phenomenon in their studies.  This method of study permitted participants to compose and share their stories in ways representing their experience as they understood and explained it.      One of the appeals of narrative inquiry is the potential to uplift the voices of marginalized persons (Maynes et al., 2012).  Gay men and lesbians face marginalization in many ways, but many feel particularly marginalized in a Christian church.  Gay-exclusionary churches often have expectations for their members that conflict with their sexuality.  For example, gay-exclusionary churches require members to abstain from acting on their sexuality or some have  57 pushed for gay or lesbian members to attend conversion therapy.  Gay men and lesbians may choose to hide their sexuality because of these policies, or they may abstain from developing a relationship because of their spirituality.  These are the stories I heard and expounded upon here as part of my research. Atkinson (1998) defined a life story as  the story a person chooses to tell about the life he or she has lived, told as completely and honestly as possible, what is remembered of it, and what the teller wants others to know of it, usually as a result of a guided interview by another. (p. 8)     Storytelling controlled by the teller allows individuals to present their story and meaning behind their experiences without need to conform to interviewer questions.  The narrative inquiry research approach is designed to examine the stories of one or more participants to understand their experiences (Clandinin, 2013).  Stories became the primary source of data.  I used them to explore the content, context, and culture of the participants.  Each participant attended a different type of church, had a different experience based on their encounters, and viewed their sexuality differently when it came to the church.  Culture and context became a factor in making meaning of those experiences.    One’s story is rarely individual (Maynes et al. 2012).  Relationships are fundamental to understanding the full narrative (Clandinin, 2013).  I heard stories of the participants’ relationships with family, friends, and their partnerships, as well as their relationships with church leaders and other congregants.  Stories became intertwined with their surroundings and were interpreted differently by each participant.  The relationships between the participants and the people they encountered, the places were part of the story, and the cultural and institutional surroundings all layered into the study from the stories arising from our conversations.   I sought to understand what the interactions were when the lesbian or gay men attended a church, what the church policies were, how the church addressed the policies, and what role  58 encounters with other members played in those interactions.  I included some interviews with gay men and lesbians who spent at least part of their lives as members of either the United Methodist Church (UMC) or the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA).  The UMC and ELCA were two major denominations that have held votes in the last two decades on human sexuality policies.  I used the narratives to shine a light on where the participants were at in their personal relationships, how their family members and friends viewed the church, and what other encounters they had with Christianity.     Historical times, places, and participants are all drawn into the narratives. “What people do and their understandings of why they do what they do are typically at the center of their stories about their lives” (Maynes et al., 2012, p. 9).  At some point participants were driven to make decisions regarding their Christian church membership and participation.  I sought, as part of my study, to uncover how their stories unfolded and how and why decisions were made when church policies and practices or encounters with other Christians came into conflict with the participants sexuality.  Stories are rarely finished.  Narrative inquiry research may conclude while the story goes on (Clandinin, 2013).      In the next section, I described my methods for securing participants and request for permission to conduct my study from the UST Institutional Review Board.  I followed with a detailed description of how I recruited and selected my participants, my data collection methods and analysis, and factors affecting the quality of my study.  Because my study involved sensitive interactions with vulnerable individuals, my awareness of the protections needed in human subject’s research took on great importance.      59  UST Institutional Review Board  IRB Permissions and Guidelines I received approval from the University of St. Thomas Institutional Review Board (IRB) to interview participants for this study.  Participants in my study were considered a sensitive and targeted group and special care was taken to protect the identity and confidentiality of those willing to take part in my study.  Permission was secured by the IRB to interview gay men and lesbians who are past or present members of a Christian church as part of this study.  I identified several members who met my criteria for the study.  As I identified additional participants, I approached them either by phone, in person, direct message, or email and shared with them a brief overview of the study.  When they expressed an interest in participating, I provided participants with additional details and shared a copy of the consent form for them to review.     I discussed my methods for protecting participants’ identity and procedures to maintain confidentiality with every participant.  I provided a pseudonym for each participant and took additional care by replacing any identifiable information, such as location, churches attended, or descriptions.  When participants confirmed their interest in participating, I walked each participant through the format of conducting the interview, including how much time it was expected to take.  I paused to allow them to ask questions and raise any concerns. Once participants agreed to participate in the study, we established a mutually agreed upon time and place to meet. I secured their signatures on the consent form prior to conducting any interviews.  Due to demographics and health and safety restrictions, most of the interviews took place over Zoom calls.  I conducted two of the interviews in person at a location of the participants’ choosing.    60 I stored the interview notes and recordings in my home in a locked file cabinet.  I was the only person with access to the locked cabinet.  I used coding to protect the identity of my participants and only I have access to the codes.  I uploaded all materials to my University One Drive account which only I have access to.  The Zoom recordings were deleted after completion of the study. Securing Confidentiality and Anonymity Safeguarding the privacy and protection of participants establishes trust that their information will remain confidential (Kim, 2016).   Taking precautions, such as using pseudonyms and altering locations are key actions in protecting participants anonymity (Patton, 2015).  Any data that could put the privacy of participants at risk was identified and altered for anonymity purposes.  I protected the identity of participants so fellow church members, pastors, and the church leadership team would not be made aware of the participant’s sexuality.  Names of specific churches and organizations were scrubbed with aliases in place where appropriate. Informed consent helps set the stage between the researcher and participant by ensuring the participant understands the purpose of the research, knows their options, how their information will be treated, comprehends the risks, and agrees to participate (Patton, 2015).  I established consent by relaying my commitment to confidentiality, presenting my IRB approved consent form, and discussing interview parameters prior to conducting the interview.  My presentation to the participant included the opportunity to opt out or exit the interview should the participant become uncomfortable at any time with the line of questioning.  I shared that the interview was recorded both in writing and through a recording device.  I also informed the participants that their information would be held in the strictest of confidence and secured appropriately.  61   I provided a consent form to the participants and interviews took place with acknowledged and informed consent.  Lastly, I reminded the participants that they could terminate the interview at any time.  None of the participants asked for the interview to cease.   I used both a written and audio to ensure an accurate representation of the participant’s responses.  I stored the transcriptions electronically on a secure system, removed names, and coded the identity of any participants for ease of access in my filing system.  The digital recorder was stored in a file cabinet safe until the recording was transcribed.  I deleted the recordings once I had concluded the coding and data chapters from the study.  Notes from the interviews were translated to text and stored in a secure file.  I did not have paper copies. I am the sole keeper of the data and used the safe in my file cabinet and a locked laptop system, including my University of St. Thomas secure One Drive account, for housing their information.  I used coding to protect the identity of the participants and scrubbed the final product to ensure no identifying information was present.  Recruitment and Selection of Participants  I identified participants by using a variety of connections I have with the LGBTQ+ community.  I used the snowball method following initial interviews to gain leads for additional participants. I used forums where a population of candidates meeting my criteria was accessible.  Once I interviewed the original participant, I asked for recommendations of additional participants who would be willing to be interviewed.  I asked that any person who recommends another participant to first gain permission for me to contact them, so that no one was outed to me without their permission.   I interviewed seven men and six women who identified as either a gay man or lesbian, and who were currently or had previously been members of a Christian church.   Table 1 shows  62 the pseudonyms I adopted for participants, the main church denominations the participants attended, as well as the pronouns supplied by the participants.   Table 1 List of Participants, Church Memberships, and Pronouns Pseudonym Main Denominations Attended  Pronouns Katie  ELCA She/Her Montana  Southern Baptist He/Him Colin  Catholic He/Him Joe  Roman Catholic He/Him George  Pentecostal He/Him Jerry ELCA He/Him Selena United Church of Christ She/Her Meghan Southern Baptist She/Her Mia Missouri Synod She/Her Taylor Methodist/Non-Denominational He/Him Vanessa Catholic She/Her Nick Missouri Synod He/Him Emily Baptist/Episcopalian  She/Her  All participants were volunteers and provided consent prior to any involvement in the process.  In addition to the consent form, I verbally provided an overview of the project and my expectations.  I reaffirmed their informed consent by asking clarifying questions about their understanding of their rights as participants.  I encouraged participants to ask questions and allowed any participant to withdraw from the study at any time during the interview process.  Data Collection Interview Selection Qualitative researchers do not agree on the optimal number of interviews required for a narrative study (Beitin, 2012).   A range of six-ten participants is suggested if sufficient  63 saturation is achieved.  Stories that extend over several years may mean a smaller sample size.  I factored all of that in as I analyzed whether I had reached satisfactory saturation of my topic.  I conducted interviews with 13 gay men and lesbian church members and heard their stories based on their church experiences.  I was confident after the interviews that the sample size achieved the objective of my study.  “Generally, narratives are obtained through interviewing people around the topic of interest, but narrative research may also involve the analysis of written documents (Wertz, 2011, p. 259).”  Supplemental materials, such as journals and letters, may also help guide the research if the participants choose to provide them.  Public events (such as the recent vote by the United Methodist Church), social media posts, blogs, and even overheard conversations could supplement the narrative being studied if used ethically and documented properly (Daiute, 2014).  There are risks to this approach that must also be considered.  Researchers should gather background information to avoid taking the information out of context and validate prior to using additional materials.  I used minimal supplemental materials in my study.  The stories were the study.  Some of the participants shared conversations they had with other people, I included their interpretations of those conversations with other people when it was relevant to the participant’s story. I made it clear in the text that the information was based on the participant’s experience of conversations with others.  Interviews took place in-person when possible but Zoom meetings were used for those participants who were located outside the Midwest or who were more comfortable in a more private setting or from a safe distance.  I recorded all interviews and used a transcription service following the interview to maintain the integrity of the stories collected.  All confidential data,  64 resources, documentations, photographs, and identifying information related to this study will be destroyed upon approval, completion, and publication of the final study.   Interview Protocol and Questions   Qualitative interviews provide a lens into a participant’s experience and provides the researcher with details and a perspective that they could not otherwise observe (Patton, 2015).  Narrative inquiry interviews allow participants to share their life stories as they relate to the research topic (Kim, 2016).  This interview approach is particularly impactful when working with participants who have been marginalized from a community (in my case, a church).   I used the life story interview approach, which is also known as a biographical interview (Kim, 2016).  The life story approach is open ended, and unstructured with an emphasis on storytelling.  The purpose of this approach is to lead the interviewee into telling their story or narrative as it relates to the research subject.   Before opening the interview, I spent time refreshing the participant with a description of the study.  I reminded them of the intent of the research and provided time for them to ask questions before the interview commenced.  I built rapport with participants by sharing with them why I was conducting the study.  This was vital to earn participants’ trust, particularly because I am an ally but have not lived the same experiences.  I told participants that although I am a straight cisgender woman, I am an ally and an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community.  I was transparent with participants by sharing that although I cannot truly relate to their experiences, my goal was to hear their stories so I could help readers understand how their experiences as gay men or lesbians have influenced their participation in a Christian Church.  I used three main questions with possible sub questions when prompting was required.  This method was used to ensure that participants had the time and space to tell their stories.   65 With narrative inquiry, a crucial element to the interview process is to ask questions that are broad and open the possibilities to extract life experiences as part of the overarching story (Kim, 2016).  I used few questions to allow the participants to share their stories completely without guidance or interruption.  I held a few follow-up questions to the side for use when the participants required additional guidance or prompting.  As a researcher, it was imperative that I remained fluid and flexible as their stories were shared so I did not miss opportunities to raise clarifying questions or probe for more details.  I made sure that when raising questions, I did not interrupt the flow of their story.   I presented the following three questions designed to encourage the participant to share personal stories related to the topic.  These three questions helped shape the story into three key chapters of the study:  1) Tell me about your relationships with the people you have encountered that are members of a Christian Church.  2) Tell me about the role your sexuality has played in your relationship with the church.  3) Tell me about how your relationship with the Christian Church has affected your relationships with people you know within LGBTQ+ community.    Sharing the personal stories of the role the church played in participants history, particularly as it as it relates to their sexuality, shaped the study.  The next section describes how I analyzed the data from the interviews. Data Analysis “The process of analysis is one of piecing together data, making the invisible apparent, deciding what is significant and insignificant, and linking seemingly unrelated facets of experience together” (Wertz, 2011, p. 261).  My data was obtained through interviews with gay and lesbian people who have had an experience within a Christian church.  The use of interviews  66 provided a solid sample of qualitative data from a variety of sources to analyze the stories of my participants.  Spending time with the participants through interview sessions, gathering stories for my research provided me with rich data and eventually a meaningful understanding of how the church played a role in the experiences of gay men and lesbian members.  The interviews also provided a robust source of data that demonstrated how participant’s encounters with the church and church members regarding their sexuality has affirmed or challenged their faith.  Finding themes and commonalities in the stories of the participants helped shape the outcome of the research.  In the next section I described how I coded the data. Coding   I began the process of assessing and analyzing the data after the data gathering process was completed.  I used line-by-line coding to uncover common themes that appeared across participants.  I used the software program Quirkos to track my findings and code information.  I used the literature reviewed and the theories identified to supplement any findings that came out of the data.  After the initial coding of the data, I began a thorough review and interpretation of the findings.  Using stories as the foundation for the study required digging below the surface of the manuscript (Daiute, 2014).     Themes  Narrative researchers, when comparing stories of participants, should seek to identify themes (Daiute, 2014).  Wertz (2011) recommended reviewing the entire interview as a first step, followed by multiple readings to identify themes and look for contradictions and their meanings.  I reviewed each interview in its entirety at least twice before starting to translate and code.  When using Quirkos, I found similarities in the stories and established bubbles of themes where the stories were related.  67 I remained cognizant of my assumptions as a researcher.  I used my awareness to identify how my assumptions affected my interpretation of their stories.  Results did not always fit the mold of my expectations, I needed to be flexible and let the data and evidence shape the narrative (MacFarlane, 2009).  As a researcher, I needed to recognize and confront my personal opinions and transcend them as I shaped the narrative (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007).     Narrative research goes beyond just looking for themes within the codes (Wertz, 2011). Participants structured and organized their stories in ways that did not always follow a sequential path (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007).  I found conflicts and gaps within the narrative and was sometime challenged to reconcile those pieces of the puzzle.  I called out those gaps when sharing the narrative or addressing the themes.  Researcher Bias and Experience In a narrative inquiry, the researcher’s history and biases will undoubtedly play a role in understanding the study.  “As we tell our stories and listen to participants tell their stories in the inquiry, we, as inquirers need to pay close attention to who we are in the inquiry and to understand that we are part of the storied landscapes we are studying” (Clandinin, 2013, p. 24).   The impact on my journey as church member, a youth leader, and a straight, cisgender ally in a church in conflict over human sexuality led me to want to understand this topic further.  I witnessed someone near and dear to me be forced to keep his relationship a secret to maintain his relationship with his church.  This experience had a tremendous impact on me and influenced my entire life’s work.   I needed to be aware of my personal experiences and the biases that resulted and set them aside to maintain the integrity of the storyteller’s narrative.  As a Christian, I needed to also be cognizant of the fact that some of my participants may have had painful encounters with the  68 church and may not be able to reconcile that.  To the best of my ability, I kept my personal beliefs out of my interpretation of their stories.  Researchers should be transparent in providing background, interest, and motivation to conduct the study, as well as any known or perceived natural biases and assumptions which may play a role in shaping the interpretation of the study (Creswell & Poth, 2018). I continually challenged my assumptions, while conducting my study.  I also took measures to recognize how my biases affected my analysis.  I included my story and motivation behind this topic as part of my study and I shared it with the participants before we began the interviews.    In August of 2009, the ELCA voted to adopt a Human Sexuality statement, which acknowledged and welcomed the membership and participation of LGBTQ+ members.  In addition, the statement allowed for the ordination of pastors in same-sex, long-term monogamous relationships.  This was a momentous event for the church, but it did not come without pain and sacrifice.  In September of the same year, my church took a vote requesting to leave the ELCA.  A two-thirds majority voted to remain with the ELCA.     Many members left the church immediately following the vote as a response to the statement.  I recognized the effects of these events and the potential for bias based on this history.  While our church has come a long way in opening its doors to LGBTQ+ members, we have yet to host a same-sex wedding at our church.  My experience with this church has fueled my desire to complete this study and to affect change in the church as a result.    I identify as a straight cisgender woman, which could lead to unconscious biases.  It was essential that I understand my own biases and prejudices as I conducted this study.  I documented my experiences within the church, reviewed the human sexuality statement at my church, and recognized how my relationships with friends and family who identify as being part  69 of the LGBTQ+ community could have introduced unnecessary bias.  Prior to conducting the study, I took multiple tests to identify my biases and was satisfied that my test scores showed favorable results for biases towards the LGBTQ+ community. As a straight, cisgender women, I faced challenges in gaining the trust of gay men and lesbians. I worked to ensure that participants felt comfortable enough with me to share their full stories, especially of those experiences that were painful to remember.     I accepted participant responses and decisions without judgment, especially those who may have left their church and altered their belief system because of their experiences.  I believe my position as a vocal ally opened some doors for participants who may not have otherwise been willing to talk to a straight Christian about their sexuality and experiences in the church.  Members of my church experienced a tumultuous church break-up over the sexuality statement.  I felt pain over the treatment of LGBTQ+ participants within the church.  It was critical that I remained cognizant of those painful experiences.  I avoided letting my experiences influence the methods used to collect and analyze my data.      My involvement as a youth director in an ELCA church prepared me for conducting interviews of a very personal and confidential manner.  Confidentiality was a crucial requirement of the role.  As an employee of a financial institution, the sanctity of confidentiality is held above all else.  This history enhanced my ability to respect and protect the participants who agreed to participate in my study.  Limitations Narrative inquiry as a method of study has some challenges and limitations.  Stories are based on interpretations and getting to the meaning experienced by the storyteller poses tests for the qualitative researcher.  It would be nearly impossible for any narrative method of study to  70 address all the complexities that arise from the study (Wells, 2011).     Wertz (2011) shared that every time a story is shared, it has the potential for revision and meaning can change as time passes, therefore no story is ever final.  Stories reflect more than just the facts of the events.  They also include the meaning and the interpretation of the experience as told by the participant.  Moustakas (1994) stated knowledge is sourced by perception, which means that we often interpret perception to be our reality.  We cannot discard perception as we study the experiences of others.  The researcher may naturally try to mold the story based on their interpretation (Wells, 2011).  The storyteller’s and the researcher’s interpretations cannot be defined as fact, but this study was not intended to be a fact-finding mission. It was a storytelling study.     Moustakas (1994) declared that I, as a researcher, must reach an understanding of my own meaning within the study before assessing the experiences of others.  As a straight, cisgender woman, it will be impossible for me to fully experience what it is like to be a gay man or a lesbian within a church.  Therefore, it is by the stories of my participants that I can immerse myself in their experiences.  As a straight, cisgender woman, I cannot ignore the fact that I have a strong supportive belief in both the LGBTQ+ community and the gay-welcoming Christian Church.   Researchers must be able to recognize their emotions and be able to set them aside to have a valid and worthy study (Macfarlane, 2009).  I recognized that I was challenged to keep my emotions out of the study.  I experienced anger, frustration, and sadness as I listened and relistened to the stories of my participants.  I did not let those emotions influence my analysis, but I did draw from them in my conclusion and call to action.     71 The only way I can truly come to know things and people is to go out to them, to return again and again to them, to immerse myself completely in what is there before me, look, see, listen, hear, touch, from many angles and perspectives and vantage points, each time freshly so that there will be continual openings and learnings that will connect with each other and with prior perceptions, understanding and future possibilities.   In other words, I must immerse myself totally and completely in my world, take in what is offered without bias or prejudgment, I must pause and consider what my own life is and means, in conscious awareness, in thought, in reflections.  I enter into my own conscious reflections and mediations, open and extend my perceptions of life and reach deeper meanings and essences. (Moustakas, 1994, p. 65)   I reminded myself to think in narrative form when I began the narrative inquiry study. To capture and retell the participants’ stories, I needed to explore all the stories beyond just the words being shared.  Understanding the environment, the relationships, and the non-verbal cues all factored in how the stories were ultimately written within the study (Clandinin, 2013).  I, as a researcher, was relentless in my pursuit of the truth regardless of my perception of how I expected their stories to unfold (Macfarlane, 2009).     I intentionally left out a significant population of the LGBTQ+ community by selecting only gay men and lesbian participants. This decision did not come lightly and was not meant to be exclusionary but helped narrow the focus on the study.  The church has limited materials relating to the bisexual, transgender, and queer+ population, and the interactions were limited.  This does not mean their stories were not critical to the intent of this study.  It opened the door to future research.     I, as a straight cisgender Christian, can never fully identify with the gay men or lesbian participants of my study.  Therefore, hearing the stories directly from those who had experienced them was impactful to the research.  What I learned in this study provided meaningful value to other Christian church members who may not otherwise be able to understand how their  72 decisions impacted gay and lesbian members.  These limitations pose challenges in the research, yet the personal narratives of the participants were deeply impactful. Summary I adopted a qualitative research approach with a narrative inquiry methodology to address my research question regarding the stories of LGBTQ+ people who experienced conflict in the church because of their sexuality.  The narrative inquiry method allowed me to understand and share the personal nature of their stories.  I obtained approval from the IRB prior to interviewing any participants and took precautions to protect and safeguard the anonymity and confidentiality of my participants.  I interviewed seven gay men and six lesbians who were past or present members of Christian churches.  I then used narrative research methods of reviewing and re-reviewing the stories to identify my themes.   Lesbian and gay men as members face challenges from some church leaders and other Christian members, and often those are the loudest voices in the room.  Because of this, even gay-friendly or gay-positive churches may struggle to attract gay men and lesbian members.  This study was designed to provide deeper insight into the impacts of these policies, challenging churches to review their practices and seek a way to better care for their gay men and lesbian members.          73 The Stories  The next three chapters dissect the experiences that participants had as they navigated their relationships as past or present members of a Christian Church.  The communities the participants surrounded themselves with as well as the encounters they had with church members, school leaders, parents and friends helped shaped their views on what it means to be a gay man or a lesbian and a past or present Christian.  The stories that follow demonstrate how participants navigated their sexuality as they faced Christians as well as how some of them reconciled their Christianity as members of the LGBTQ+ community.  Figure 3 provides a roadmap of each chapter, including the themes and topics addressed within each section.  Figure 3  Data Roadmap for Chapters 4-6     Relationships•Dating the opposite sex•Coming Out to Family and Friends•Revealing or hiding sexual identity in school •Coming out as Christian to LGBTQ+ CommunityChurch• Early Church• Extended Church • Sexuality in Church•Church Vote on Sexuality Belonging•Church Community•Gay Embracing Church• Searching for Church•Church is Home•Worship outside of church church• Leaving the church 74   In Chapter Four, the participants described their relationships with others, dating the opposite sex, how it felt to come out in each of their inner circles, what it was like to hide their sexuality, and the challenges that occur when telling the LGBTQ+ community that the participants are also Christian.   Chapter Five told the stories of how early involvement in the church shaped how the participants responded when the church addressed sexuality.   Chapter Five includes stories of participants who followed their callings to further their connection to the church but taking on leadership roles.  Chapter Five also includes descriptions of how the participants faced their sexuality within the church.  Chapter Five concluded with stories about the participants experience when two major Christian denominations voted on how to address human sexuality within the church.  Finally, Chapter Six detailed the stories of how gay men and lesbians handled the loss of community when the church and the communities involved let the participants down because of their sexuality.  In the conclusion of the data chapters, Chapter Six addressed where the participants landed when they were forced to make decisions at the cross-roads of spirituality and sexuality. This included whether they were still searching for a church, or the church was still a home to them, or if they chose to worship outside of the church walls, or if they left the church permanently.  The stories in Chapters Four, Five and Six revealed how members navigated their encounters with Christians and how those encounters led them each to their current standings within or outside of the Christian church.            75 CHAPTER FOUR: RELATIONSHIPS  I interviewed seven gay men and six lesbians about their experiences in a Christian church.   Participants shared stories about their early church attendance, their relationships throughout their Christian journeys, their coming out stories, and their current connections to the church.  Participants faced hurdles throughout key moments in their lives that shaped their relationship to the Christian Church.       Gay men and lesbians often faced struggles when they began to identify their sexuality. Although some recognized that they are gay from an early age, others did not realize their sexual identity until later in life.  Facing their sexuality often meant having to tell others who may not be supportive and who may even try to change who they are.  Many gay men and lesbians faced having to come out to others repeatedly.   Figure 4   Chapter Four Roadmap  Figure 4 provides the roadmap for this chapter, including the key themes found in the participants’ stories. Chapter Four focuses on lesbian and gay men’s relationships with parents and peers, dating the opposite sex, and their meetings with leaders who have influenced their church participation.   Participants were often forced to hide their sexual identities in their Relationships• Dating the Opposite Sex• Coming Out to Family and Friends• Revealing or hiding sexual identity in school • Coming out as Christian to LGBTQ+ Community 76 schools.  Additionally, the participants were faced with opposition from the LGBTQ+ community when they told the community that they were Christian.   Identifying and Finding Meaning in Sexuality In this chapter, the participants voiced their stories of their early relationships and their early educational experiences in a Christian setting and included stories of how academics influenced their response to the church’s stance on their sexuality.  11 of the 13 participants resisted their sexuality for quite some time before coming out.  Chapter Four focuses on what factors influenced the delay in acknowledging their sexuality and how they handled their coming out stories.    Several participants dated members of the opposite sex to hide their sexuality from their peers, parents, the church, and authority figures.  This next section focused on how participants navigated those relationships and their motivation to hide their sexuality.    The Opposite Sex    Three participants fought to maintain a relationship with someone of the opposite sex, including dating or marriage.  The measures the participants took with the opposite sex was a direct response to the church’s stance on their sexuality.  Eleven of the participants dated people of the opposite sex and two of them married before coming out.  Selena and Jerry were the only two participants who shared they had not dated people of the opposite sex.   Three of the participants had significant and meaningful relationships with the opposite sex and shared those stories.    Colin moved to the US when he was 17 years old.  It was here where he met and “fell in love” with someone he respected and with whom he shared the same morals and goals.  He married her, and they have a daughter. At the time he felt like he had found love and was  77 following the path he was supposed to.  When their daughter was a year old, he found that he could no longer fight the feelings he was having for other men.  He knew he could not continue to live a lie and he owed it to himself to discover who he is.  He finally came out to his wife, and they mutually agreed to end their marriage.  He was determined to pursue love in his “new reality.” He described the situation as being more difficult than he anticipated. He could not just jump in to living his truth.  It was not as easy as just following his heart.  He spent three years in therapy. Colin gave a lot of credit to the effectiveness of therapy and said it was a critical part of his healing process.  It provided him with the tools he needed to fully embrace being a gay man.   George was following his calling to become a minister.  He knew that he could not date men and still lead the church in ministry.  He tried dating women because he believed that was expected of him as a future minister.  George was taught from an early age to be a good shepherd for his church. Part of being a good shepherd meant that he would be expected to hold to a “familial standard…which included having a wife and starting a family.”  George’s deep commitment to becoming a minister meant that he took great measures in hiding his sexuality. During his time dating women, he used his commitment to God as his reason to avoid having sex with the women he dated.  George participated in multiple sessions of conversion therapy.  It is important to note that conversion therapy is an extremely dangerous practice, now banned in most states.  Conversion therapy was designed to push participants to choose Christianity over their sexuality.  The details of George’s conversion therapy experience are provided later in this chapter.    Emily knew from an early age that two things were most important to her: (1) she wanted to be a priest and (2) she wanted to be a mother.  Facing her sexuality would have been an obstacle to both of those paths, so she pushed any thoughts of dating or marrying a woman aside.    78 She refused to see herself as anything other than heterosexual. She married a man and together they share four kids. It wasn’t until after that marriage disintegrated that she began to recognize her feelings towards women.   Coming Out   Many of the participants said they had to come out repeatedly, with their friends, with the family, within their communities, their work, their schools and their churches.  This cycle repeated itself every time they moved or changed jobs, attended different schools or found a new church.  The stories shared in this study were centered on their inner circles, schools and churches.  In this section, participants shared how they navigated their coming out experiences amongst their families.  Out to Family    Most of the participants only touched briefly on what it was like to come out to their parents, however those experiences ultimately shaped how they saw their futures within the church as gay men or lesbians.  Three of the participants had an easy coming out experience with their parents but four of them included stories of fear and frustration.    Selena had the easiest outcoming of any of the participants.  She described the day she came out as a spectacular experience!  When she was a teenager, she and two other friends headed out of town to a Pride parade and ended up on the front cover of the Globe.  Her father keeps that picture on his iPad and shared it with pride to anyone he met.   When Taylor came out to his family, it was almost a non-event.  His grandma had been with her wife for 25 years and he also had an uncle who had been with his husband for as long as he could remember.  His family was already open and accepting.  One day he brought a boyfriend home and his mom just said “okay” and normal activity resumed.   79   Colin also had an easy experience in coming out to his family.  When Colin finally came out to his parents, they were open minded and accepting. They welcomed anyone Colin was dating and treated Colin and his partners with kindness and respect.   George knew he was gay from as young as he could remember.  He believed he may have always known.   He was terrified to come out to his family.  George described his stepdad as very homophobic, therefore George knew that because of the environment he grew up in, being gay was unacceptable.  This made coming out at home nearly impossible.   Meghan came out in her early 20s and both parents “flipped out” on her.  Their Southern Baptist foundation would not allow acceptance of their daughter’s sexuality. The conflict between her parents’ Southern Baptist roots and Meghan’s sexuality grew into a source of contention between them for many years.  Meghan’s relationship with her parents continued to be difficult and the messages she heard from the church were causing her angst.  Although those relationships were deeply meaningful to her, she knew that to survive she had to free herself from the barriers that were keeping her from living her truth.  Meghan continued to distance herself from God and the church so she could “be who (she) was going to be.”      When Mia first started dating other women, Mia’s parents were very concerned for her because of their deep roots to the church.  At one point Mia’s mother said to her “I think you need to find another way to be happy.”  Later Mia felt a powerful shift in her mother’s support for her as a daughter that included her as a lesbian.     Mia described how her mother went from questioning her to becoming an advocate for the entire community.  Mia spoke about her mom who was visiting a friend whose daughter had just married her wife.  The mom broke down in tears when Mia’s mom asked to see the wedding album.  The mom declared that she kept it tucked away because she never knew how others  80 would respond. Mia’s mom emphatically told her to “whip it out and show it off.”  The mom became very emotional and explained how proud she was of her daughter and how much she also loved her new daughter in law.     Mia knew that her mom had to make a lot of personal sacrifices because of her Missouri Synod church background.  Her mom had grown up with a strong set of church rules.  To Mia’s mom, those rules were written in concrete.  Mia understood how much it cost her mother to stand by her.  Her mom’s transition from telling her that she needed to find other ways to be happy, to becoming an advocate for her and the whole LGBTQ+ community, had an enormous impact on Mia.  She laughed at how she now must fend off her mother’s pressure to marry her partner, Shawna.     Vanessa wasn’t sure where her parents stood so she feared the conversation and it took some time for her to come out to them.  When she was growing up, she never heard either parent say anything negative about gay people or being gay.  Yet her mother had a strong Catholic faith including spending time as a nun.  She considered her dad more of a “casual Catholic.”  Vanessa was an activist at her school, and she found herself on national television representing the gay-straight alliance for her school.  When she came home for a break, her mom asked her if there was something she needed to tell them.  Vanessa laughed when she shared that she quickly responded to her mom with “nope, nah, all good.”   When Vanessa eventually came out to her parents, it was an initial shock but didn’t amount to much more than that.  They never considered it a religious issue, they were just caught off guard and that was all.     Timing of her coming out was concerning because of the AIDS crisis.  She was scared because she had a very young woman friend who contracted AIDS and died from it. Vanessa was deeply bothered by the response of the Catholic Church to AIDS.  Vanessa was the only  81 participant who mentioned AIDS during her interview, but it was a key contributor to her response to the church as a member of the LGBTQ+ community and as an activist.      Coming out to peers and friends provided a different set of challenges depending on what type of school the participants attended. In this next section, participants shared what it was like to come out to their friends, teachers and counselors in school.  Out Amongst Friends   Each of the participants described friendships with people they had met in church.  This influenced the participants decisions to hide their sexuality from their friends.  Most of Taylor’s friends were people he knew from church, because of this, he waited until much later in life to reveal who he is to his friends.  He described himself when he was still in the closet, as being “like an actor in a play.”   He played a completely different character than who is his today and took many steps to ensure none of his friends figured out who he really was.     Taylor was constantly aware of his role and how he needed to play it and felt like all eyes were always on him.   He operated in defense mode, ready to deflect the conversation any time his identity was at risk.  Taylor was never able to let conversations with friends get too deep.  The protective shield he stood behind caused him to keep his relationships at arm’s length. He used his best friend who was a girl as his cover.  He would post pictures with her to give the façade that they were in a relationship.  He hoped this was enough to keep others from raising any questions about his sexuality.     Taylor believed that closeted gay men and lesbians miss a lot of the development that others get to experience in social settings.  Closeted gay men and lesbians don’t have the opportunity to mature in the same ways that people who are free to live as themselves do.  Taylor saw himself as a much different person now that he was out.  He knew he lost credibility with his  82 friends when he came out.  He believed his friends felt like they never really knew him.  Although he lost friends, which he feels is mostly self-inflicted, the experience was freeing.  He described the relief he felt by saying he was finally able to breathe.     Colin was not shy but meeting new people and making friends was difficult when he first came out.  The gay bar scene felt very “cliquish.” He did not have a circle of gay friends to go out with.  He was not sure the bar scene was where he wanted to meet someone, but he tried to fit in there because he struggled to meet friends who were accepting of his sexuality, and he could not find someone to date.     Jerry defined his coming out experience as a “strong thing.”  He was 28 years old and had been fully focused on his work as a paramedic.  Initially, as someone in a very visible role in a small town, he was not sure he would ever be out.  He described being gay as a secret that he would just have to live with.  He decided that he no longer wanted to sneak around and treat his being gay as some dirty and secretive thing.  When he finally came out, he went all in, and he has not looked back since.  He fully embraced his sexuality and became an advocate for others.  He realized that to the generation below him, coming out was not even a thing, certainly not the way it was when he was coming out at age 28.     Katie was afraid to name her sexuality.  It was not until she made the decision to start dating and stop hurting herself with drugs and alcohol that Katie was able to say to herself that maybe she was gay.  She was getting to a place where she could accept that about herself.  She admitted that she still had a hard time articulating her sexuality because being gay was still not acceptable in most circles.  Katie was scared to be herself in many places and found that even though she loved to travel, she knew there were certain places she could not visit because “there is so much hate in the world.”  She was scared and saddened by that.  83   When Emily’s marriage fell apart, she finally found the space to acknowledge her sexuality.  Having questioned her feelings at an early age, when she divorced, she knew she had to face that she is a lesbian.  She did not describe a specific coming out moment where she had to tell others that she is a lesbian.  She now lives with her wife, the children she brought with her from her previous marriage and other children they foster.    One of the children that Emily and Shania foster together is a gay man who was disrupted from several foster homes.  He was with them because he was unable to be placed as a 16-year-old gay youth.  When he was with a recent couple, he had wanted to attend what Emily described as a “baby pride [event], no parade, no drag queens, just some pop-up tents.”  The case worker considered the event inappropriate and would not allow him to attend.  When he entered Emily and Shania’s home, it was the first time he had encountered a stable gay/lesbian relationship.  Their relationship and family dynamic gave him hope for his own future.  Emily and Shania were teaching him how to be an advocate for himself.     Meghan experienced a devastating breakup, the relationship was filled with deception, they had just purchased a home together and it all suddenly fell apart.  She was broken and alone and questioned whether God could really exist and if so, how could He allow all of this to happen to her.   Meghan felt utterly alone as she wrestled with her break-up, and she needed help in healing.  She wanted to reconnect with God but feared being shunned for her sexuality.  It took Meghan meeting the love of her life for her to become comfortable being herself.  She since became very open about her sexuality in all social settings, networks and with anyone she encounters.    When Vanessa moved across the country, she knew that she was not straight but had not yet realized that she was a lesbian.   Vanessa first came out to her best friend Shelby.  Shelby and  84 Vanessa immediately shared the news with Shelby’s parents.   Because Vanessa and Shelby had been nearly inseparable for many years, the parents’ only question was whether Shelby and Vanessa were a couple.  The family was Jewish so in their minds, it was a non-issue.     Vanessa had met two very good friends who were part of a Christian Network that Vanessa belonged to.  She was not originally comfortable being out to them, so she waited until after graduation.  When she finally did, her fears were justified, and it didn’t go well.   She shared that when you are from [New] Jersey, you are Catholic, you are not Jewish, or Christian.  This encounter is where she started to see more rigidity around Christianity vs sexuality.  One of her friends responded with “I love you, but I can’t agree with your lifestyle, but I will pray for you.”  Vanessa was crushed by their conversation responding with “I don’t need your [f-ing] prayers.”   It was the first time someone close to her, a close friend had cut her off.  The only people that have ever severed a relationship with her did so because of their Christianity.  She struggled to wrap her mind around that.    This section focused on what it was like for participants to come out to friends and described why participants avoided coming out to people who were part of their church communities.  As participants struggled to come out to friends, they also encountered challenges in their schools.  In the next section, participants shined a light on what it was like to face their sexuality in an educational setting. Sexual Identity in School   Six of the participants attended religious schools or colleges which made their coming out experiences especially difficult.  As the participants offered their stories, it was evident that their time in school had an impact on their view of how others perceived their sexuality.  Although not always directly related to the church, one of two things occurred for most of the  85 participants: (1) the church’s stance on sexuality influenced how they addressed their sexuality at school, or (2) the school’s response to their sexuality (if they attended a Christian high school or university) shaped their view of the church.   This section is focused on education including high school and college and how participant’s encounters at school influenced their coming out experiences as well as their relationship to the church.  High School   Katie first shared that she felt as if something was off with her, but she then corrected herself and said “I shouldn’t even say off, different, different where I was not starting to fit in.”  At the time, she didn’t know what it was, she hadn’t yet considered her sexuality.  Around the time of Katie’s senior year in high school, she heard another girl say she was going out with her girlfriend.  It was the first time she had even considered that girls could go out with other girls and form dating relationships.  She became curious because this was her first encounter with conversations on dating someone of the same sex.     Katie began to grapple with why this suddenly became so important to her and what that could mean. Katie started to sneak around.  She began to research, to try to understand what some of the language was like and what that could mean for her.  Her research was more harmful than helpful.  She kept getting discouraged by the sources that told her that being in a same sex relationship was wrong or bad.  Katie continued to struggle to name her sexuality when she talked about this time in her life.      When Colin was a teenager and his “hormones started to kick in” he began noticing his attraction to men.  He admired women, but he was more drawn to men.  He started to have questions about how he was supposed to behave and had to fight off his thoughts and desires.   86 Eventually Colin brought his questions to the priests, both at the school and at his home church.  When he raised his concerns at confession all priests responded with the same solution:  Pray about it, say your Hail Mary’s and try not to think about it.     Joe was bullied regularly for being “effeminate.” He was not out in high school, but he was often called a “faggot” by other students. Joe’s first encounter with negativity from the church towards his sexuality happened as a high school student in a required theology class. It was during this class that Joe first heard that according to the Bible, homosexuality was considered a sin.  This shocked him and filled him with dread.  With thoughts of harming himself, he reached out to his English/debate teacher for help.  When she asked him why he was thinking of harming himself, he came out to her.   He found a great comfort in her support.   She was not a part of the Catholic church.  The compassion she demonstrated towards him provided him with comfort and a sense of calm relief.     Joe’s two other debate teachers were also very supportive.  Every class had a couple of counselors available, so he sought additional guidance from one of his counselors.  After working with several supportive counselors, things took a wrong turn, and he encountered a roadblock.  The next counselor was exceedingly uncomfortable and had no clue what to do with him.  Instead of offering guidance, the counselor sent Joe to therapy.  Joe believed his counselors were “handcuffed by the institution” and were not able to provide the guidance he needed to feel accepted as a gay student.     Joe eventually had a meeting with the school principal.  Outside of his theology courses, this became Joe’s his first outright encounter with homophobia.  The principal informed Joe that the school could not support gay students because “the people who fund the school are anti-gay.”  Joe was shocked as he sat and listened to the principal.  It was not at all what he was expecting  87 from that conversation.  He described the experience as an outer-body revelation where he suddenly felt unsafe and wasn’t sure how to escape the room.  He was devastated and went back to his counselors.  The counselors were not surprised and could not really help.  Joe was so upset by that encounter that he couldn’t process it and was unable to share his feelings about it with his family.     As he reflected on that memory, Joe described how troubling it was.  It was too much to consider that all the pressure of navigating through that time was put on the shoulders of him as a student.  At the time, he did not feel mature enough to handle it.  He compared the encounter to what the students at Parkland, Florida had to tackle after their peers were shot by an assault rifle.  Joe was visibly frustrated when he described what is asked of young people who must carry the burden of homophobia (and gun violence, and racism), on their shoulders.  He was grateful for all he learned, and he appreciated his ability to see the world through a different lens, but he was appalled at what students go through without the support of the adults in the room.  Joe carried that burden into college, and this led him to become involved in student activism.     Nick started to recognize what he described as “urges towards boys/men” in junior high and high school.  It seemed so far out of the norm, so he questioned whether it was just a phase.  He pushed any thoughts of attraction towards boys to the back of his mind.  During this stage, there were no gay celebrities and no one he knew that he could identify with.  He couldn’t understand why he felt the way he did, so he suppressed all his “urges” throughout his pre-college years.     This section highlighted the struggles that the participants faced as gay men or lesbian students and in coming out to people in their schools.  The next section focused on what participants encountered as adults in college.   88 College   Some participants didn’t come out until they were in college, while others who were already out, faced additional obstacles when they went to further their education.    Joe described himself as an angry college student who rebelled against the administration.  He became heavily involved in activism by starting a gay club. He described his student activism as an attempt to establish relationships, but he found himself struggling to bond with others.  He had not realized it until he was already a student, that the college he was at was rated by a prestigious college ranking system as the “most homophobic school” in the United States.  Due to his activism, the President of the college placed him on a list of students he would not meet with.  He sparked hatred and violence with his passion for the cause.  He received death threats from other students.     Mia went to the same college as Joe.  Their college was considered the “Face of the Catholic Church of the 21st Century.”   Although she was out, she was very quiet about it.  She did not quite feel at home at the college and thought that the school did not like the LGBTQ+ community.  During her time there, she led a support group for lesbian, bi-sexual and questioning people.  The school informed her that her group could not have dances, because “Dancing leads to sex and gay sex is wrong.”   She really struggled with why a queer group could not have dancing when other dances were held across campus.     Vanessa said her story started to get “sticky” when she returned to the East Coast to attend University.  On her second day at school, she met two people who she still considers her closest friends, one gay, one straight.  Together at this Catholic University, they decided to form a new gay-straight alliance.   They went through all the proper channels and received all the right approvals.  They coordinated with other Universities (including other Catholic Universities) to  89 make sure all their bases were covered.  When they went to launch the alliance, her school administration shut them down.  She spent her entire Freshman year fighting for this group.  She was even on national television for her advocacy.     This was Vanessa’s first encounter with Catholic people who were hateful.  She had faced people who disagreed with her and were not supportive of her sexuality, but she had not combatted hatred based on sexuality within the Catholic community.  She started to question whether she belonged at this University.  She was shocked by that revelation.  Prior to this event, it had never even crossed her mind.  “There was not one single moment in time where I believed there was anything wrong with me because I am gay.” Her activism was her entire focus and her grades and status as a student suffered.     Towards the end of her freshman year in college, two major things happened to Vanessa: (1) she had a death threat on her car, telling her that people like her were not wanted at the University and (2) she received a note from her chancellor asking her to immediately go visit him.  When Vanessa walked in to meet with the chancellor, he had a priest sitting next to him.  She knew the conversation was about to get serious.  The chancellor told her that he was not happy with what she was doing and that she had some decisions to make.  He presented her with an ultimatum.  She would need to either meet with the priest so he could help her attempt to “resolve her problem” or she would have to leave the school.    This meeting confirmed that Vanessa did not belong at this school, and she told her parents that she would never go back.  They were not happy with her, but she did not tell them why.  Her parents were very upset with her for leaving school, but they understood that she was miserable.  Vanessa’s life fell apart after this incident.  She saw herself as a stellar student who was suddenly a drop out.  It hit her like a “two-by-four” across the head that the church was  90 behind all of this.  She found out later that the chancellor of the school was tasked with having this conversation by the archbishop of her diocese.  Vanessa then shared that this person, who had led the charge to shut down her existence at that school, was the same person who became one of the most notorious men of the Catholic Church’s sex scandal.  She said, this man “used his power to try to get rid of her, tried to destroy her and he had never even met her.”    This school’s push to shut her down and get her to leave impacted more than just Vanessa.  They assumed that every person involved was gay, even the allies that she was working with.  The school set out to persecute her friends as well.  Vanessa considered this just a small part of her story, but at the time it felt huge because her whole life was falling apart. She looked back on that encounter and could hardly believe that the school and the Catholic church feared an eighteen-year-old girl.    Vanessa turned to taking classes at a community college to get her grades up.  She had a great experience at her next school.   At the time she was there, they did not have a gay-straight alliance until her senior year.  She did not get too involved because she was busy pursuing other things.  Vanessa had already found a different path for her activism. She was working on the school newspaper, and she used that venue to share her agenda.  Vanessa’s experiences in school and her activism for the LGBTQ+ community led her to a career as an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community supporting families and workplaces across the United States.  Taylor’s college experience had minimal impact on his sexuality or spirituality.  When he attended a Quaker University, after having a strong Christian High School experience, his relationship to the church just started to fade and he did not find himself seeking it out further after college.     Nick grew up within the Lutheran Church.   He laughed when he said he was part of the  91 Missouri Synod and described their culture to be more conservative than other Lutheran churches.  He participated in all the church activities available to him including Bible studies, youth programs and the choir.  Nick’s engagement in church activities led him to pursue a career in church leadership in college. Nick attended a Christian University in the Midwest, with a goal of becoming a director of Christian Education.  Nick’s first encounter of a direct bias over his sexuality was at this school.  I shared more of Nick’s college experience in Chapter Five where he described his experience pursuing a leadership role in his church.   Many participants ran into obstacles with coming out in their schools, each of these interactions described was in some way connected to their school’s or other student’s views on sexuality stemming from their Christian beliefs.  LGBTQ+ Christians often face a double-edged sword.  Christian participants encountered challenges in their relationships within the LGBTQ+ community because the church has hurt so many members.  Some of them described how they have navigated being Christian and gay.   LGBTQ+ Community Response to Christian Identity   Gay men and lesbians who are also Christian, often find themselves at a crossroads between their sexuality and their religion.   In addition to the challenges gay men and lesbians face when coming out to the church, those that decide to stay with the church or adhere to some form of Christianity or spirituality, were required to defend their beliefs to the LGBTQ+ community.   Many LGBTQ+ members were hurt by the church.  Eight participants revealed how the conflict between the LGBTQ+ community and their connection to the church influenced their friendships and determined how open they could be about their faith.    As Mia moved around, there were certain places where her community of LGBTQ+ friends made it difficult for her to be open about her faith.  She often found it more difficult to  92 tell her friends in the community about her faith than to tell the church she is a lesbian.  When Mia was at college, one of her friends asked her what she was thinking by attending church with people who “want to kill us all?”  Others asked her why she wanted to be a part of something where the main mission seems to be trying to break up their relationships.  All this led Mia to feel caught in the middle between her faith and LGBTQ+ community.     Mia believed that people often try to be whom others want them to be.  Although she faced conflict with both the community and the church, she never really lost any friends over either relationship.  She believed she lost some credibility within the LGBTQ+ community and thinks her friends see her as someone who has been duped by the church.  Mia grew her hair out long and suddenly people started asking her if she was still gay.  When she told them she could not stay out late with them because she had church to attend the next morning, her friends responded: “all people are weird, you go do your thing.”  Mia explained that she just cannot believe that she is the biggest thing in the universe.  Mia cannot look around her and think that there isn’t something bigger at work, creating and holding it all together.  She understood the pain the church caused people she cares about within the LGBTQ+ community but it’s her relationship with God that keeps her committed to the church.  It is Mia’s hope that one day faith and sexuality can fully intersect.     Montana believed if he belonged to a church, it would cost him his “street cred” with the LGBTQ+ community.  He imagined there were a lot of barriers to being a gay Christian and that it was easier to explain why you did not like the church than declare that you do.  Montana found it difficult to fight for a church that would not stand up for him. There is a stigma to being a gay Christian within the community and those who are, struggle to gain trust from within.  The church has a horrible reputation within the community because being gay is all about being  93 inclusive and the church is seen as exclusionary. Montana doesn’t want to be that gay Christian on the outside.    Many within the LGBTQ+ community see the church as an evil institution that focused on harming them.  Montana was sad when reflecting on the separation of church from the LGBTQ+ community.  In many ways Montana believed that the church was the best part of him, it gave him something that many within the community did not have.   Montana credits the church with being the reason he wants to be a good person.  He struggles to reconcile what he knows about the church that is good with how the church treats the LGBTQ+ community.  He believed they should be in the fight together, on the same side of things, taking care of each other. In his mind, it should be a no brainer to reconcile the church and the community.   Selena saw herself more as part of the church than part of the LGBTQ+ community.  She was more involved socially when she was in college and even had some questions around her commitment to the church during those years.  Selena described her time of separation as more about going through the regular process of questioning than being tied to her sexuality.  Because her experience was mostly positive and she was not connected within the LGBTQ+ community outside of her church, she really had not heard from others who were hurt by the church. She wished she could find some gay friends to socialize with, the Pride events, gay bar scenes and other special events were not part of her community.  Selena felt more comfortable sticking with her church community.    For Jerry the script was flipped.  Because he has separated from the church, his circle of friends in the LGBTQ+ community were not bothered by his past connection to a church that hurt him.  On the day that we met, he was getting ready to travel with a friend to witness (and maybe cause a bit of a ruckus at) an event.  The speaker was scheduled to proclaim that Jesus  94 saved him from homosexuality.  Jerry was struggling a bit with how to handle the emotions the event was sure to stir up.  He was not sure he could hold back, and jokingly wondered if he should secure bail money in advance.    Jerry faced a different type of pressure in his relationships between the LGTBQ+ community and his former faith community. Jerry was constantly being challenged by others to consider his faith background.  They questioned, challenged and showed disdain for his atheism.  Jerry’s biggest fear when he left the church was more powerful than the fears he faced when he came out.  He believed he was going to be shunned more for not being a Christian than for being gay.  He was shocked that people would expect to him stay with the church after all the church had put him through.  When I first contacted Jerry about the interview, he hesitated to participate. He believed I would not like what he had to say about the church.     Jerry has since discovered that leaving the church was really a non-event within his community.  When he was questioned on why he left the church, he told people it all started because he is gay.  He said: “Nobody has really said that I’m going to burn in hell for being a non-believer.”  That said, he still does not understand why they wanted him to be accepting and respectful of their beliefs but were unable to return the same respect for his.  Jerry said the truth is, he just does not have any beliefs at all.   He often was asked if he was afraid of going to hell, and he responded that he is not because he does not believe in hell at all.      Jerry’s focus was on his career, and he saw that as his way of contributing to his hometown community. What he really wanted was to be seen as the guy who was in the field constantly helping people.  It was important to him that they do not see him as someone who was angry or bitter over how the church treated him.  What happened in the church, did trigger a political party switch and he became a strong advocate for LGBTQ+ rights in the state.   At the  95 time of this study, he was running for office.    Jerry’s only regret was the burden this put on his mom.  Jerry’s mom was still an active and faithful member of the church.  She believed she failed him, but he continued to make it clear to her that is not the case.     Vanessa described talking about sexuality with her Christian community or talking about Christianity with her LGBTQ+ community as going into the lion’s den.  Vanessa’s wife Marlene was one of the first people within the LGBTQ+ community that Vanessa met who did not roll her eyes at her when Vanessa told her she was Catholic.  Prior to meeting Marlene, Vanessa never really had conversations about her faith within the LGBTQ+ community because she felt it was just the norm.      Vanessa’s friends within the LGBTQ+ community often called her a fool for believing in God.  They told her she was a traitor for supporting an institution that hates them. These comments were extremely hurtful to her, but she believed she could not get mad about it, and she did not see them as personal attacks.  She understood that people did not get to that place without something happening to them that caused them pain.  If she had not experienced a positive experience with a warm and welcoming little church down the street, she may have ended up in a similar place with her feelings towards the church.  Vanessa saw a lot of hatred and harmful attacks coming from the LGBTQ+ community towards Christians.  Her response caused her to laugh and declare: “I am not messing with your relationship with Lady Gaga, so stop messing with my relationship with God.”       Vanessa recognized that it could be difficult for allies, especially Christian ones to connect to the LGBTQ+ community.  She said allies are forced to prove themselves to the community and “if you are a Christian, you really really need to prove yourselves.”   One of her  96 clients had a traumatic experience by the church therefore, it would be impossible to convince the client that Christianity is meant to be a loving institution.      Vanessa’s career with an organization who provides resources to corporations on how to support the LGBTQ+ community sometimes put her in awkward situations.  The intersectionality of sexuality and religion is often in conflict. She found herself confused by corporations that call for help but are more terrified of having religious conversations than they are about having sexuality conversations in the workplace.    Taylor’s friend group was divided, some were very committed to the church and found accepting churches where they felt valued.  One of Taylor’s friends had experienced a tough time coming out in their church, but eventually found a gay affirming church home.  The other side of his friendship circle were a bit overbearing on their protection of the LGBTQ+ community.  Taylor’s friends were divided but mutually supportive of each other.  Those that attend church are free to talk about their experiences as if they are describing “where they are going to brunch” but don’t question or push those that don’t.  Taylor laughed when he shared that he gets roasted by both sides any time he walks in the room while holding a bag with a chicken sandwich from that fast food restaurant that is known for funding anti-gay initiatives.  Religion was a non-event amongst friends.  He shared that he experienced more contention around that chicken sandwich than any other religious conversation.      George believed that there is a lot of conflict between the LGBTQ+ community and the church.  As a leader and activist with his local Pride committee, he recognized that most members of the LGBTQ+ community are hesitant to allow religious organizations to participate in their Pride related events due to the pain the church has caused the community. He shared that in his mind it is like asking victims of trauma or abuse to go to their abusers and ask for  97 reconciliation.   Regardless of past pain caused to the community by the church, George was convinced that LGBTQ+ people continue to seek a faith community.  George was determined to do something about that.  He dreamt of sitting down with pastors and members of the community together and working to resolve their pain and conflict.   Colin’s circle of friends came from a variety of spiritual backgrounds including Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim.  Because of this they are all open-minded and respectful of each other’s faith and spirituality.  He can talk freely amongst his friends about his spirituality, and they are comfortable doing the same with him.   Summary  Chapter Four included the stories of how participants navigated their relationships and early educational experiences when they began to recognize their sexuality.  Participants faced several instances of making decisions regarding their sexuality.  Many of the participants had to come out to family, friends, and leaders on multiple occasions, causing anxiety and stress.  Some of those encounters exerted long term effects on their ability to establish trust and relationships with others.     Participants faced multiple encounters regarding their sexuality.  The participants’ responses to the church’s stance on sexuality were shaped by those encounters.  Some of the participants did not come out until later in life due to what they experienced in their schools and amongst their friends because of the church.  In the next chapter, I address how participants navigated their Christian journeys, from early participation through extended church involvement.  Participants then provided their stories on how the votes of two denominations regarding policies on human sexuality influenced their beliefs.     98 CHAPTER FIVE:  THE CHURCH  As participants established relationships and connections with members of the Christian church, they faced hurdles in coming out.  Not every gay man or lesbian has had a specific encounter with the church regarding their sexuality, but the messages coming from church leaders both inside and outside of the church often translate to negative experiences from others because of some Christian church beliefs regarding human sexuality.  Figure 5 provides a roadmap for Chapter Five and includes how participants experienced church from early involvement through leadership roles and facing their sexuality within the church.  Finally, this chapter concludes with addressing how participants navigated the church’s votes on human sexuality. Figure 5 Chapter 5 Roadmap    This chapter includes stories of how the participants’ involvement in the Christian church affected how they navigated their sexuality when coming out to members of the church.  Participants described their involvement in Christian education, youth group participation and some taking on leadership roles in the church.  Church involvement affected their experiences when they came out to other church members.  Finally, this chapter addressed how participants were impacted when two major denominations voted on policies regarding human sexuality. Church• Early Church• Extended Church • Sexuality in Church• Church Vote on Sexuality  99 Church Involvement Participants disclosed what it was like to grow up engaged in Christian worship services, Sunday School, youth groups, and other activities - only to realize that for many, the church did not support members who are gay men or lesbians.   Parental influence drove early church participation the participant’s lives.  Twelve of the 13 participants were influenced by one or both parents to attend services and get involved in the Christian church.  Four participants had strong parental influence provided by both parents.  Four participants were guided through church via a strong maternal influence.  One shared that her father was the most influential in her involvement with the church.  Three participants were involved in early church activities but did not recognize a specific parent for their involvement.  There was only one participant who declared that he was not led to the church by either parent.   Early Church    Participant’s early church involvement and their parent’s encouragement to attend contributed to the difficulties they faced when identifying their sexuality and coming out to others.  Their roots were planted within the church and the church’s stance on their sexuality made them feel at risk for acceptance within the social networks, their families and especially the church community.    Parental Church Influence      Participants who were raised by both parents guiding a strong relationship to the Christian church, may have faced even greater hurdles as they made sense of the church’s views on their sexuality.  Colin grew up surrounded by a predominantly Catholic community.  His parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and most of his extended family were “very Catholic.”  Colin moved when he was in fourth grade, and he began attending a Catholic school.  His school  100 had its own church and was run by priests.  When services were held (mostly for special events) his peers were only allowed to miss the mass if they were from a different religion (such as Jewish).    Colin started to question the Catholic church at an early age.  His questions were theological rather than related to the church’s stance on sexuality.  Some of his questions were around communion. He also questioned the teachings on the path to Heaven.  He struggled to understand what happened to those who did not have a religion, such as those born into African Tribes or who raised as Chinese Buddhists.   He couldn’t rectify how he should be “lucky” enough to be saved based solely on his geography. None of these teachings made sense to him.  When he asked his parents questions about faith, they always answered with the same basic reply: “Just believe.  You just have to believe.  Don’t question.”   Regular attendance at Mass was part of the weekly routine.  Everyone he knew was expected to attend and no one ever asked questions or resisted going to worship services.  It was just something they were expected to do.  He continued to attend regularly without resistance.  Everything changed when he was mature enough to make choices on his own.    George also grew up in a very religious (Pentecostal) household.  His family belonged to an Assemblies of God church, and he considered them to be “super religious.”  George viewed his stepdad as being extremely homophobic.  He described his involvement as an “experience… a charismatic like movement.”  Worship services included jumping up and down, waving flags and speaking in tongues.  There was an intense focus on the emotional experience, creating a more supernatural type of movement designed to generate alter calls.  During an alter call, some churches ask members to come up front to the alter and proclaim their commitment to Jesus Christ.    101  The charismatic Pentecostal movement is very conservative and takes a harsh stance on gay or lesbian relationships in the church.  George starting hearing derogatory comments regarding his sexuality from an early age.  He often heard things like: “God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve” and “homosexuality is gross” or being gay is an “abomination.”  He said these phrases were often used as weapons to portray the churches views on sexuality.  George faced a lot of turmoil and conflict around his sexuality and his place in the church.  This led George down a very dangerous path.    Meghan was raised Southern Baptist and described her parents as being very strict regarding religion.  She knew as a young woman that she was attracted to girls but her religious upbringing did not allow her to even consider exploring those relationships further.   It was imbedded in Meghan’s head that God would not love her as a lesbian.  This belief caused her to start protecting herself.  She began putting some space between her and God.     Vanessa considers her story “pleasantly complicated.”   She said it begins as early as she does: “I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t a part of the church… [the church was] part of my existence from the beginning.”  She has always loved the sense of community she found within the church. During her childhood, all her friends were deeply connected as Catholics.  In her hometown in New Jersey, there was a different Catholic church on every corner.  When people in her community identified themselves, the main way they identified themselves and each other was by what parish they belonged to.    Maternal Church Influence   Mia’s parents met when they were very young.  Her mom was 16 years old when she met her dad and they married at ages 19 and 20.  Mia grew up with two younger sisters and an adopted sister joined the family when Mia was 19 years old.   Mia’s family had to move around a  102 lot for economic reasons.  Moving frequently meant that Mia had to attend a “spectrum of churches.”  Methodist, Presbyterian and Missouri Synod were all part of the mix.  Mia’s mother was raised in an Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA).  Mia called her father a “godless heathen.”  Mia’s first encounter with facing adversity in the church happened when her family started attended the Missouri Synod (Lutheran) church.  Saying “Missouri Synod” out loud gave her some visible angst.  She mentioned that she had no idea how different Lutheran churches could be until they started attending the Missouri Synod church.   Mia shared a brief example of how dissimilar the Missouri Synod church felt compared to what she was used to experiencing with the ELCA.  Mia’s mom was very involved any church they attended.  Her mom defined community as being part of a church committee.  When her mom tried to join the women’s group with the Missouri Synod, she was shocked when they would not move the meeting times to a timeslot that could accommodate a working woman.  Women members of the Missouri Synod church were expected to be homemakers.  Working was frowned upon by the committee and they had no interest in accommodating a working woman’s schedule.      Each church that Mia attended taught her something new.  Because of the variety of churches Mia had attended, she started to question the differences in stories that were shared.  One day during Sunday school a teacher proclaimed that “the Jews killed Jesus.”  This declaration went against Mia’s understandings of what happened to Jesus.  She questioned the teacher and confidently asserted: “Umm that’s not really how that works.” When Mia pushed for further clarification, she was penalized and forced to take extra catechism classes.      Mia’s questions around the discrepancies caused her to reflect on other teachings that she struggled to reconcile.  When the topic of sexuality was introduced, she started to question what  103 that meant and if all churches held the same beliefs.  She continued to challenge her church leaders on these teachings.  Her questions and contradictions did not go over well, and tensions began to mount between Mia and this church.   Mia understood that many groups, including the church, defined themselves by who is part of the in group and who is part of the out group, so it did not surprise Mia that church had similar struggles.  She gave an example of how there are feminist groups out there who are against transgender women.  Mia believed the people within the church who hold the LGBTQ+ community at bay, must be reading a different Bible than she was, because to her the message is that love becomes something when you give it away.  Mia’s faith in humanity was shaken, but not her faith in God      Montana’s biggest church influence was his mother. His father did not attend.  Montana smiled as he remembered his church history.  As Montana prepared for the interview, he thought it was fun to think about his church upbringing.  Church was something he hadn’t considered in quite some time.  The church was an important part of his life for a long time and thinking about it reminded him of what the church experience had given him.  He was thankful for what the church taught him and what his upbringing within the church meant to him.    His mom was Southern Baptist, and it was important to Montana’s mother that he and his sister grow up with a church foundation.  Sunday mornings were his parent’s opportunity to be alone, so they sent Montana and his sister off to Sunday school followed by worship services.  They were gone for several hours every Sunday.  Montana and his sister rode together to church on a big bus.  Each Sunday the bus would drop them and other students off at a big auditorium.  Thousands of kids were piled into folding chairs to watch their lessons on a big projector.  He described the auditorium as being so big and full of kids that the screen was too far away for him  104 to see.     Montana enjoyed his Sunday morning rituals, but he was not sure he believed what was being taught.  Montana found the New Testament and the stories of Jesus to be the most appealing.  He was able to connect with the message even though it seemed a little bit like mythology.  He enjoyed the lessons and found it fascinating to learn about things that they couldn’t learn in school. Sunday school was a lot more interesting than the worship services.  Montana considered worship quite boring.  He did not think he really learned all that much during the worship portion of the routine.     Montana described the experience as a “little weird” as the kids were carted off separately from their parents during the services.  He oversaw his little sister, and without his parents in attendance a lot fell on his shoulders to be responsible for her.  He was fearful of the inner-city kids who attended Sunday School and worship services with them.  Montana’s role was to make sure he got his younger sister home safely.  He described how terrified she was to even walk past the crowd alone.  He had to walk her to the bathroom each time she needed to go.   Montana recalled a moment that suddenly became clearer to him during his recollection.  He had not previously given it much thought.  Montana had regularly attended services with a friend of the opposite sex.  He held her hand on the bus because her hands were always cold.  He described this experience as “purely functional, a safety measure and not like a boyfriend/girlfriend type of thing.”  One day they were told that they could no longer do that.  Upon deeper reflection, he believed that incident was tied to racism.  His time with this church was his first taste of anti-diversity and he struggled with what to make of that.    When Montana and his family moved to a different state, they found a smaller Southern Baptist church to join. He remembered finding it strange that this new church was only made up  105 of “Black and white people.” He went from attending Sunday morning activities in a large auditorium with thousands of kids to attending a church with only about 30 people in attendance.   Montana and his sister became more active and added Wednesday night youth activities to their church routine.  Montana’s pastor was very charismatic and had a strong presence at the altar.  During the worship service, they could always tell when church was about to be over because it was time for the alter call. There were some moments where he felt called to walk up to the alter and recommit his love for Christ.  When either he or his sister made even the slightest movement towards the alter, his mom would yank them back without saying a word.  He and his sister realized it was important to her that they not make a spectacle of themselves by participating in the call.  She believed that the alter calls were for infrequent visitors, not for regular attendees.   Montana vividly remembered the communion ritual during these worship services.  He was not allowed to partake even though communion was only held twice a year at his church.  At the time, he did not understand why he was unable to join in sharing in the communion meal and blessings.  Montana later found out that it was because he was never baptized.  He found this to be very odd considering how important his church attendance was to his mother.    Jerry’s main parental influence was his mom.  His dad attended church occasionally, but his mom’s faith was strong.  It was very important to her that her children were raised as Christians. Jerry and his siblings grew up attending Sunday school and regular worship.  They were all confirmed in their home church and some of them still belonged to this same church.  When Jerry started to drift away from the church after high school, he continued to attend because he was afraid of disappointing his mom.     Joe considered church participation to be an enormous part of his early life.  He attended  106 services twice a week but did not provide stories around his early participation. Joe was raised as a Roman Catholic.  His father participated but was not very religious.  He considered his mother the guiding force for his church involvement.    Paternal Church Influence    Selena was the only participant who shared that her father was her prime influence in the church.  Her father was open and out as a gay man and although they attended the same church they went to different services.   Selena’s father attended a later service with his husband.  Selena started going to church when she was a baby. Her best friend was someone she met in the church nursery.  Her first active role came as early as first grade when she started singing in the choirs.  She also spent some time as an acolyte.  Acolytes volunteer to help the priest or minister with minor duties during the worship service.  Volunteering as an acolyte was the first to go when she felt overwhelmed with doing more than one thing at each service.  Selena was heavily engaged in the youth group throughout high school.  Her involvement caused her to later seek leadership roles in the church. Individual Church Influence   Taylor’s parents did not attend church, therefore he initiated church attendance on his own.  Taylor grew up in the Midwest and described his family as “not religious at all.”   He considered his mom a holiday Christian, meaning she only attended worship service on Easter and Christmas.  When his mother was younger, his grandma had dabbled in Catholicism but that was the extent of his family’s connection to the church.  When he asked his mom why she didn’t attend church, her response was that the nuns were mean, leaving her little desire to attend.  Taylor felt like something was missing in his life.  During middle school, all of Taylor’s friends were involved in church activities.  Taylor needed a place to socialize outside of school, so he  107 began searching for a church.  Taylor’s tiny town hosted five churches and a bar. He had plenty to choose from.     It was easier to make friends by becoming involved in the youth program.  Taylor started attending a Methodist church, mostly because it was just down the street.  Attendance was small, with approximately thirty people a week.  When he became old enough to drive, he found a non-denominational Christian church.  The church was much larger and drew around 200 people in attendance each Sunday.  He loved being a part of a larger congregation and every week he felt a warm welcome.   The congregation was warm and non-judgmental.     Three participants were involved in early church activities but did not recognize a specific parent for their involvement.  Katie, Emily and Nick were involved in church during their youth.  None of them credited a particular parent as having an influence over their church upbringing.  Katie shared what happened when she was a part of her church’s youth group.  Emily’s early involvement led to her being called to the priesthood.      Nick’s stepfamily is located deep within the Bible belt. His stepfamily’s personal belief system taught them that the church shuns Nick’s sexuality.  He understood that many of them would be anti-gay if they did not know and love him.    Extended Church    Several of the participants were so immersed in their early church activities that they sought out deeper and more meaningful roles within the church.  Selena, Nick, Emily and George all felt called to positions in Christian Church leadership. Missions and Youth Ministry    Selena’s mother and grandma attended a United Church of Christ (UCC) church. The UCC as a denomination does not hold specific policies regarding sexuality in the church.   108 Instead, individual churches make their own policies.  Because of this, many UCC churches are known for being open and affirming towards the LGBTQ+ community.  Selena was recognized by church leaders for her passion, participation and involvement in the church.  One day Selena received a call from their minster.  The UCC youth group was taking a mission trip to South Dakota and wanted her to help lead the mission.   She had just graduated from high school and the group was scheduled to leave just a few weeks following her graduation.   Selena was confident and always felt comfortable with her sexuality within her church.  Her church’s pastor at the time was an out bi-sexual man who kept a pride flag hanging behind his desk.  This stood out to Selena.  She appreciated that he was open about his own sexuality and he demonstrated his support towards others in the community including herself.     When she was asked to join the mission trip, her church had just recently started publishing their open and affirming statement in their worship bulletin.  Prior to the public affirmation, her church had always been very welcoming and accepting.  Selena was comfortably out to all the youth, parents and leaders who were participating in the mission trip.  No parent or leader questioned their student’s safety in the hands of the leaders on this trip.  Selena loved the mission experience, and this led to her attending several additional trips with the youth group from the UCC church.  A few years later, Selena was part of the leadership team that convinced the youth to return to South Dakota.  As part of that mission, the leaders and youth spent time alternating work and learning about the Native community.   Shortly after that final trip, her minister had given notice that he was leaving the church.  This was a blow to Selena as he had been such a big supporter of the LGBTQ+ community.     George’s religious upbringing eventually led him to obtain his degree with a double major in youth ministry and biblical literature.  After graduation he accepted a position as a  109 youth pastor.  When he officially came out, a lot of conflict ensued between himself and the church.  Because of this, George tried hard to fight his sexuality.  George knew he could not be a gay pastor, so he took unconventional action to fight his sexuality.  George worked through his “attractions” via conversation therapy.  One of the steps required was to create a video recorded testimonial demonstrating how he was changed by the church.  After George created his testimonial, he met a boy.  He described this person as someone he enjoyed spending time with, talking to and sharing his feelings with.  The feelings were unexpected, and he wasn’t sure what to do with them.  This was the first time in his life he found someone that he established a serious connection with. He knew it was different from any hook-up he had previously had with men and any relationship he had ever encountered with a woman.  He had loved women before but in a friendship capacity and never romantically.  The relationship was a source of inner turmoil.  He described what a struggle it was for him to reconcile how he was feeling about this boy with how he was expected to react.     It was when George finally established a meaningful male relationship that he realized it was time to come out.  He set up a meeting with his direct pastor and shared his story.   He was very nervous but did not expect the fallout to be as tumultuous as it turned out to be.  After meeting with his pastor, he was then forced to meet with all the other pastors on staff and tell them what was happening.  The pastor reacted with sadness. George knew there was some anger there, but it was the disappointment and shock that rattled him.  The pastor stated that he blamed himself and asked George where he had gone wrong in being his leader.     The rest of the pastors on staff were concerned that he would lead other people down the same path as if being gay was a contagious disease.  One of them accused him of being a fraud and told the rest of the staff that they could no longer trust or believe anything that George had to  110 say.  The comment that really struck George was when that same leader had said “I knew there was something wrong with you from the beginning.”   George did not have a single ally in the room.  Not one person stood up for him or showed him any compassion or understanding.   As he was about to leave, the staff held a prayer session, asking God to lead him down the right path.  There were approximately 25-30 people in the room praying for him and saying hurtful things.  He left that meeting feeling exhausted, betrayed and totally abandoned by his church.      No one stood up for George during the meeting, however, one person demonstrated support by reaching out to him after that horrific experience.  That leader took him out to coffee.  She treated him with care and concern by asking him how he was doing and what he was feeling. She was the only person who spoke to him following the meeting.  He credited that person with helping him on his journey towards being his authentic self.  That one trip to Starbucks was the only moment throughout the entire experience where George truly felt valued.    George went home for a week and decided he needed to pursue his relationship with the boy that gave him the courage to come out.  While he was back home and spending time with this boy he had fallen for, someone from the leadership team discovered a photo of the two of them together and used it to pursue further action against him.  When he returned, he found out that based on the recommendations of the leadership team, a letter would need to go out to all the parents of the youth in the congregation.   The intent of the letter was to explain to the parents what was happening with George and to assure them that the church did not support George in this relationship.  George was offered the opportunity to say something in the letter, but the content of the letter was very damaging to George as a person.  The hurt and dejection it contained was not something he wanted anything to do with.  The letter contained the phrase “The ways of the world aren’t always the ways of God.”  Those words left a permanent mark on  111 George and was still haunting him at the time of our conversation.      An extended amount of time passed before George was ever able to speak with any of them again.  He eventually sat down for coffee with a former supervisor. The supervisor shared with him a bit of what they were feeling on the other side.  The staff believed he had abandoned them because he didn’t say anything further when he left.  The staff member that had reached out said the rest of the staff had possibly overreacted in trying to put out a fire that hadn’t even started yet.   This was not enough for George.  He moved back home shortly after the whole ordeal, but the relationship that led to his coming out did not survive. Educational Ministry    Nick held leadership roles within his church by teaching Sunday school for a variety of age groups.  This led Nick to pursue a career from a Christian University in the Midwest.  Nick had a goal to become a director of Christian Education.  In the early stages of Nick’s identification of his sexuality, his desire to be a church leader outweighed the importance of being his authentic self.   During his internship, he spent a lot of time in prayer, focusing on asking God to free him from his sexuality.  He prayed and begged God to “take the gay away” from him.  Around the time of his internship, a rumor was circulating amongst the students that all students would be asked if they were gay during the post internship interviews.  Prior to hearing the rumors about the interview, Nick had not put a name to his sexuality.  He started to ponder how he would answer that question.   When praying the gay away didn’t work, Nick knew he had a decision to make.  His fear consumed him.  He worried that would not be able to truthfully answer any of the rumored post internship interview questions about his sexuality.  Instead of facing those fears, he chose not to return from his internship.  He knew he could not be in church work and be gay.  It was an  112 extremely painful decision for him.  He was not out to anyone yet, including his parents or those closest to him.  His parents did not take the news of his decision not to return to school well.  They pressed him for further answers, but he was not ready to face his sexuality or tell his parents that he is gay.  They were shocked and could not understand his decision to leave school.   Their son, who was so “gung-ho” about pursuing this path with the church, suddenly just quit.  He told them that the ministry was just not for him, but they struggled to accept that as his answer.    The decision to leave was so painful to Nick that he cut off all ties to the people at school.  He did not feel that he could come out to anyone, so it was easier to just sever his relationships.  Nick still harbors a lot of regret over how he left school.   He wishes he had given his friends and leaders the opportunity to accept him.  The lack of closure with them still haunts him.  For many years Nick had dreams of returning to visit the place that had caused him so much fear.  It was too painful for him to consider the possibility that they would not accept him for who he is.  Cutting them out of his life and not being able to close out that chapter has been a painful experience for him.    It was not until after he was married that Nick faced a few of the people from his school. He was no longer hiding his sexuality and was open about his marriage to others and on social media.  He believed that they would have discovered through social media connections that he is gay, but he did not want to face the topic directly.  Many of his peers have chosen not to interact with him.  He assumes that their distance is because he is gay and that his sexuality does not jive with their beliefs.     After 15 years of avoiding his close connections from school, Nick reconnected with the person who was the director of his program when he attended the University.  He and the  113 director used to be very close.  When Nick had his wisdom teeth out during a college break, the director had him stay with him and helped to care for him since he was far away from home.  The relationship between Nick and this director was very important to Nick.  When he confided in the director how difficult it had been for him to leave, the director was very transparent with him.  He told Nick that he had done the right thing in leaving the school.  The director believed Nick would not have been safe had he remained at the school.     During the director’s tenure at the school, he had faced others who had tried to come out to him.  The director shared that he did not want to be burdened with pushing those students out the door.  So, to avoid a direct conflict, he would unfailingly redirect the conversation by asking the student to confirm that they of course meant “hypothetically,” or they were asking the questions on behalf of someone else.  This tactic made the director feel like he had some control over the outcome of the conversation without being forced to pursue action against the student.    The conversation between Nick and his former director eased some of Nick’s pain.  That said, he was not completely healed by their talk.  The director’s transparency opened the door for Nick to ask him about the rumor he had heard regarding the post internship interview questions about being gay.  The director laughed and said no such question would be asked.  He reinforced that it would be discouraged to ask such a question again forcing them to have to act against the students.  The director’s response made Nick wonder if his peers had started the rumors because they “could see the sexuality in” Nick.   Nick was troubled by this but now believes that those rumors are what triggered him to face his sexuality sooner.  In the end, Nick believes those rumors saved him from what could have been a very painful experience had he returned to school.     Nick still has a great relationship with his former director.  The director left the Missouri  114 Synod Church and joined the ELCA.  Nick believes the director’s motivation stemmed from the church’s stance on sexuality as well as the church’s belief in what a woman’s role should be in the church.    Although Nick had a lot of regrets about how he handled leaving the school, in hindsight he knew it was his best path forward.  He recognized that the reason for his departure stemmed from more than just facing his sexuality.  Looking back, he realized that because he is an introvert, the career would have taken him well outside of his comfort zone.  He recognized that being a leader in the church was not his true calling.  Seminary   The passion Selena found with the mission trips led her to seminary.  When she started attending her training, she was surprised by some of her encounters with other seminary students and leaders.  The school she attended was supposed to be non-denominational, but it was founded by the Baptist Church and the United Church of Christ.  Selena would face students and leaders who were anti-LGBTQ+ and who shared their views with her during classes and personal conversations.  She struggled to reconcile her beliefs and the beliefs of the UCC with what she was hearing from those other students and leaders.  She kept asking them how they ended up at a school that was so supportive of the LGBTQ+ community.  It boggled her mind that they would actively speak up against the LGBTQ+ community during classes and discussions.     Selena ultimately decided not to continue to follow the ordination path and now considers herself an overeducated lay person in the church.  Serving the church was still very important to her.  She continued to seek ways to be a leader in her congregation and even filled in as a substitute preacher.  She had not completely ruled out becoming ordained in the future.  Selena believes there is still time for her to pursue a pastoral role later in life.   115   Emily felt the call to be a priest at the age of 17.  Emily’s calling was so important to her that when she initially started questioning her sexuality, she pushed any thoughts of other women off to the side.  In Emily’s eyes, being lesbian was incompatible with the life she wanted for herself.  In the 1980s her church had begun to wrestle with LGBTQ+ issues but they were not ready to confront it with actions quite yet.  Then in the early 1990s, her church received a lot of pushbacks for having gay and lesbian couples in the vestry and in leadership positions.  The church had been very welcoming and supportive for the LGBTQ+ community for as long as she could remember so she struggled with what to make of this new resistance.  This was the beginning of seeing the church through a new lens for her.   Emily was starting to witness the tension between her church and the response of some members towards the LGBTQ+ community.  Shortly after this, the only LGBTQ+ minister that she had known was murdered.  The rumors were that the motive for the murder was because he was “gay ordained.”  This solidified her need to keep her sexuality at bay while she pursued a career with the church.     When we met, Emily was still actively pursuing ordination.  Her path towards the ministry hit several roadblocks along the way.  After college she moved back to her home state and joined a Baptist Church.  She described this church as being very different from what many view as the typical Southern Baptist denomination.  Unfortunately, the church did not allow the ordination of women so she left and sought out a church that would allow her to pursue her calling.  She returned to the Episcopalian church.  The synod where she chose to pursue ordination had three divisions, each of which had very different stances on women and sexuality.  When she applied to seminary, the bishop over her division stopped her application.  He explained to her that it was because of her relationship status (she is now married to a woman),  116 she was too young, and she would have to wait for progress to catch up to her.  Emily translated this to mean that it was because she is a lesbian.  He blocked her from submitting the paperwork and said she could reapply in five years.   Emily went through a discernment process before she determined next steps.  Five years was longer than she wanted to wait.  She was unsure if she would be allowed to apply within her division even after the five years waiting period ended.  She decided to go “up the mountain” to a neighboring church that was led with a different approach.  Shortly after she switched churches, her new bishop retired, and her pursuit was pushed back another two years.  The church she chose was not one she would normally select to attend.  One of the most appealing aspects of this church was that it allowed her to be her authentic self.  She and her wife were not the only LGBTQ+ couple in the congregation, but they were the only ones who were still working and who had children at home.  The congregation was warm and welcoming, and they made her, and her wife feel loved and supported.   Making this switch opened doors for Emily to pursue her calling.  In 2018, she was finally given permission to submit her paperwork to attend seminary.     Days prior to the interview, Emily had just heard the news that she was accepted into seminary.   Although the process took longer than the original five-year roadblock, the bishop who first stopped her application had not changed his position.  This confirmed Emily’s belief that she made the right choice in following her calling through her new church home.  Sexuality and the Church  Members of the LGBTQ+ community must come out repeatedly as they encounter new people and new communities.  Many of the participants did not start out in a gay affirming church.  As participants navigated their way through their church upbringing, most participants  117 encountered a turning point where they had to face the crossroads between the church’s stance on sexuality and their sexual identity.    Gay men and lesbians who are members of a Christian Church often face extra scrutiny.  Many of them often have an agonizing experience when coming out within their church community.  Gay men and lesbians are often forced to wrestle with their sexuality because the churches they belong to or participate in teach that they are wrong to have same sex relationships.  Due to the church’s stance on sexuality, some confronted significant obstacles, and others rebelled against the church. The “coming out” stories reveal the trauma and loss the participants experienced when they disclosed their sexuality to others or continued to hide their sexuality in fear of adverse consequences.    Some churches avoid addressing sexuality from the pulpit but in return do not have welcome and affirming statements assuring gay men and lesbians feel comfortable holding hands with someone of the same gender in church.  Other churches have policies in place restricting the ordination of ministers, limiting whether LGBTQ+ members are allowed to present or take communion and blocking the recognition of or hosting same gender weddings.  Regardless of the churches policies and practices, gay men and lesbians often sit in the pews with questions about how the church and its members would respond to them if they knew they were gay.   Facing Sexuality in the Church   I previously shared stories from participants who faced a crisis of their sexuality when religious leaders and school authorities challenged the participants regarding their sexuality.  In addition to those stories, participants described the encounters they had with other church members regarding their sexuality.       118 Praying the Gay Away George shared that his sexual encounters with men started in high school and continued while he was a youth pastor at his church.  He was deeply troubled by how the church would view those hook-ups.  His church took a strong stance against pre-marital sex, regardless of what genders were involved.     George took dangerous action in his attempt to change his sexual orientation.  His quest for success as a church leader put him at constant odds with his sexuality.   His church upbringing taught him that he could not become a pastor if he had been “gay in the past.”  George’s need to suppress his sexuality while pursuing his degree forced him to practice conversion therapy tactics.  Conversion therapy is now illegal in most states and has been proven dangerous (Gold, 2019, Fitzsimons, 2019).      George described his experience with the conversion therapy program as an ‘intense counseling prayer session.”  Counselors prayed over him, asking God to free him from the “demonic influences” that were leading him astray in his sexuality.  During one session George sat with his eyes closed while a leader guided him through a spiritual ritual while another “prayer person” sat with him and acted as an assessor.  The leader led him to specific memories and tried to reintegrate those memories by reshaping the experiences.   The leaders told him he was damaged from his gay encounters and their mission was to repair that damage and cut the demons out of this life that were influencing his soul.   George did not see these sessions as bad.  Even during the interview, he described the sessions as therapy. That said, after the sessions he felt a strong push (as presented by his leaders) to erase the demonic presence he assumed to be oppressing him.    George took part in the conversion therapy practices twice during college.  The first time  119 he kept the reason he was there to himself.  The second time he was more open in sharing his motivation for participating.  As he told the therapists his reason for attending, he did not consider the conversations to be about “coming out.”  His need for the therapy centered around his history of having sex with men and considered them transactional. He did not view the encounters as relational or as a permanent part of who he was.     The expectation that George would marry a woman and start a family was ingrained in him from an early age.  Attending conversion therapy was part of his mission to “fix himself.”  He felt like being straight was the only way he could have a meaningful relationship with God. George’s church background had taught him to believe that anyone who is gay is destined to “suffer eternal torment until you get thrown into a burning like fire for the rest of eternity.”  He was terrified of going to hell if he didn’t “become straight.”   George explained being confused about his sexuality.  He never felt like it was safe to talk about.  Instead, he focused on how he could stop his sexual encounters with men.  The experience consumed him.  He found it exhausting so he pursued another conversion therapy session while he was employed by the church.    George was the only participant who spoke openly about his aggressive pursuit to change his sexuality.  He believed that the only way he could have a relationship with God and with his church, was to go beyond maintaining heterosexual relationships.  He had to become someone who is straight.  He claimed that he took all the necessary steps asked of him to become a straight man.  He thought it was a common feeling amongst gay men.  He believed most gay men desired to be straight.     George explained that after being taught for so many years that he would go to hell if he was gay, he always believed he could pull himself together and get straight.  He was terrified that  120 he would “suffer external torment” if he didn’t find a way.    During one of his conversion therapy sessions, he created a testimonial video. In the video, he focused on the church and started to believe he was being changed.  He desperately wanted what his testimonial to be true.  He tried to will heterosexuality to be true within himself.  He assumed that if he kept repeating the straight narrative with himself, it would eventually become his truth.  That video turned out to be his final attempt at the straight life.    Nick and Colin were the only other participants who tried to change their sexuality through prayer.  Neither went into details of their prayer therapy.     Three of the participants spoke expansively on sexuality in the church.  Their stories are highlighted in the next section.   Church and Sex   Mia struggled with what she was witnessing both inside and outside the church as she started to think about her own sexuality.  Mia was sitting in a classroom on Sunday and the students were all going around the circle and describing how they viewed their bodies as sacred and saying all the things that were expected of them during the lesson.  She was shocked by the lies she heard as she recalled that same person “having sex on the hood of their car” the night before.  She was baffled by the lies that were told with such ease and without “batting and eyelash” by her fellow classmates.   She was a junior in high school when she just could not take it anymore.  She went home that day and told her mom that she was not going back to Sunday School because of what she had witnessed.  By her senior year in high school, she had decided that she was “done with dogmatic religion.” When she left high school, she had completely separated herself from the Missouri Synod.   Nick contemplated whether a part of the problem in the movement towards acceptance of  121 sexuality in the church was that sexuality can be hidden.  LGBTQ+ persons do not have to reveal their sexuality to others and sexuality isn’t readily apparent to everyone.  Because of this, Nick felt that many people connected to the church believe that being gay or lesbian (or any part of the LGBTQ+ community) is a choice.     The lessons Montana learned about sexuality from the church were not specific to being gay.  He was taught that sex and all pleasure were bad.  The lessons were so powerful for him that he remembered after the first time he masturbated, he “felt so guilty [because of church] he didn’t do it again for another year and a half.”    When he started to consider his sexuality, Montana knew that in the eyes of the church he was “not normal.”   The church taught him to believe that he should be “raging against his feelings.”  The fear of God’s wrath held power over him. During his younger years, Montana chose the church over his sexuality.     George’s church taught him that all pre-marital sex was prohibited.  When George used a young woman to cover up his sexuality, he referred to the church’s rules against having pre-marital sex as his excuse not to partake in a sexual relationship with the young woman.   In Chapter Four, two of the participants shared that they had been engaged in activism which was met with resistance from their schools because of the church.  Additionally, two participants shared stories of when politics and the church collaborated against the LGBTQ+ community. Those stories are covered in the next section. Politics in Church   Mia’s faith was always strong, but she did not always have the best experiences in the church.  Mia faced a troublesome encounter with her family’s church.  Mia’s family remained part of the Missouri Synod church and Mia would return to attend with them from time to time.   122 During one of the services, Mia faced her first real challenge within a Christian church as a lesbian.  As the congregation was bowing their heads in prayer, she heard the minister start to pray for politics.  The prayer was not the typical prayer you hear in many churches where pastors pray for leaders to make sound decisions.  The prayer was targeted in asking God to reach out to the senators with specific direction.  She described the context as having an “enormous anti-gay sentiment.”  During the prayer, the entire family stopped praying and looked at her.  She wanted to get up and walk out.   Because they were seated towards the back, leaving would not have had the impact she desired, therefore she chose to linger so that she could speak to the minister.  After the service, she told the minister that she was really offended by what they had prayed for in church that day.     Shortly after that service, she received a letter from the church. The letter stated that she would need to “participate in counseling and would no longer be welcome to take communion and would therefore be dammed forever.”   Mia was 31 years old when this incident occurred, yet the church decided to engage her parents.  They called her parents in and spoke with them about their concerns for Mia.  They specifically said that they did not approve of her being an older, unmarried woman.  In addition to her marital status, the church leader’s biggest fear was that she might somehow communicate to the children that it was okay to be gay.      Mia was hurt and angry about the letter.  Despite what occurred, she walked away feeling like her “faith was stronger than their hatred.”  Mia said to her mom: “I know you love this church, so I will go with you on Christmas Eve, but otherwise, I am done.”     The following Christmas Eve, as promised, Mia returned home and prepared to attend their usual service at her mom’s Missouri Synod church.  As the time to leave for church neared, Mia worried they were going to miss the service.  She finally yelled to her mom that they really  123 needed to get going or they would miss it.   Mia became very emotional when she described what happened next.  Her mom looked at her and said that they would be attending a different service that evening because “any church that won’t accept my family, is not my church.”  This was a defining moment for Mia.   Although Mia’s personal experience with that church did not alter her faith, it did leave a mark.      In Chapter Four, Vanessa faced her first conflict between the church and politics when demonstrators hosted a “die-in” to force the Catholic church to address the death that was happening due to the AIDS crisis.  The protestors were arrested, and Vanessa was heartbroken over the lack of response from the Catholic church.   That was Vanessa’s first encounter with politics in the church.      Many years later, Vanessa married Marlene who had also been raised Catholic.  When Marlene convinced Vanessa to go back to mass, two things happened during that very first mass: (1) The priest prayed for the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman and (2) The priest prayed for the souls of the priests who were accused of wrongdoing in the Catholic church sex scandal.    Vanessa was almost immediately on edge during the first part of the prayer.   When the priest started the second part of the prayer, she was shocked!  She couldn’t even reconcile what to do with that prayer and she certainly couldn’t participate in it.  She tried to wrap her head around how the church could pray for pedophiles while at the same time praying for her not to exist.  Vanessa walked out and said she would never return.  Marlene stayed for the rest of the service while Vanessa waited outside.  They did not return to this church and eventually moved away from the area.    Participants who experienced the entanglement of politics and the church, were hurt and  124 confused by the message the church was sending regarding their sexuality.  The church also let the participants down when its members started to turn against them and the people they loved.  The next two sections address what happened to the participants when the church did not stand by them or let other members hurt or threaten them because of their or their loved one’s sexuality.     Let Down by the Church   Katie grew up in what she considered a typical Lutheran church.  She followed the usual routines of Sunday school, confirmation and participating in youth groups.  It was important to her from an early age to have God in her life.  In addition to her home church, she regularly attended a Catholic church with her grandparents on Saturday nights. She believed that God was with everyone, and she could feel his presence.  Church was the one place Katie trusted there was no separation of people even by race.  It never crossed Katie’s mind that God would want to separate people for any reason.    When Katie was in high school, tensions started to rise between herself and the church.  The youth group she was a part of in the (ELCA) Lutheran church had a falling out.  There wasn’t anyone who would take over the program.  The students were lost without someone they could trust or someone they considered to be a safe person they could bring their problems to.  The lack of having a safe person to confide in posed a lot of challenges for Katie.  She was just beginning to question who she was.  She did not have a trustworthy mentor she could turn to for guidance.  When Katie was sharing her story with me, and describing what she was going through, she still struggled to name her sexuality.  She used terms like “people that were the same as me.”     The falling out of the youth program was a pivotal point in Katie’s life.  She wrestled  125 with figuring out who she was.  She was seeking answers from God but did not know who in the church she could talk to.  Katie did not believe or did not know if any of her friends were grappling with the same questions.  She could not find anyone who would sit down with her and help her navigate her questions.      The changes Katie was going through were tugging her away from the church.  This was difficult for Katie because the church was still a very important part of her life.  Instead of being able to resolve that conflict, she turned to things she knew were not healthy for her.  She started consuming drugs, alcohol and having sex.  She partook in anything that would keep her mind off her sexuality.   She kept going to church in hopes of salvation and healing.  She knew it was something she should do, but she found herself just going through the motions.  She no longer felt connected to God or the church community.  She followed the rituals, sat in the pews every Sunday, but she did not hear the messages. She felt dead inside.     She questioned who she was and what her sexuality could mean for her.  She felt lost and hopeless.  She kept reading that loving someone from the same sex went against what the Bible, the church and what God said.  She found herself thinking “Oh okay, I can’t do that” and tried to force those feelings aside.  She knew she was different, but she wasn’t ready to accept being a lesbian.  She felt incomplete.  She continued searching for answers but started to believe that God had abandoned her.  Her disconnect quickly turned to anger.      Katie’s life started to spiral as she continued to question her spirituality and her sexuality.  She began hurting herself and the people she loved.  She moved away and eventually met others who were in same sex relationships.  As Katie continued to fail to find answers, she used drugs and alcohol as a numbing agent.  Katie was overwhelmed with feeling dirty and shameful.  She felt guilty just for being different from what others expected her to be.  She could not believe it  126 was okay to be different.     When Katie first met others who were in same gender relationships, she witnessed that they were happy couples.  The people she encountered did not have God in their lives.  She did not know how to reconcile the two.  She wrestled with this idea that you could be happy only with one or the other.  Katie then began to consider that maybe the answer was to push God out of her life.  She hoped this would help her find the same happiness that she had witnessed in other same gender couples.  She sought happiness in her relationships but at the same time, she was devastated by the loss of her church.  This brought her to a breaking point.  She “no longer wanted to live” and attempted suicide.  She still struggles with suicidal thoughts, but she avowed not to give up.     Katie continued to seek answers, exploring what was acceptable.  She questioned every attempt at a relationship.  Simple questions caused her great angst.  Questions such as: “Is it okay to go out for coffee with another female if nothing is… [going to] happen?” Or “If I have feelings towards another female, are they okay to have?”   She experienced a timespan of about six years where nobody knew who she was, including herself.  Katie kept trying to find a way to make it acceptable to become the person she thought she was becoming.  She had people in her life who were telling her it was okay.  The rest of the world was telling her she was going to die and go to hell.   The conflicting messages from the people she was closest to were tearing her apart.  She fell deeper into addiction.  She asked herself: “Which is worse, dying because I am exploring a same sex relationship or dying because I am slowing killing my body by trying to numb myself in other ways?”  For Katie, hiding her genuine self was killing her more than what the drugs and alcohol were doing to her.  “I still can’t be the person who I believe God created me to be.  So, I’m still killing my body, still  127 killing my heart because I can’t be me.  I still have to hide.”    Katie hit a crisis at around age 25.  Suddenly, tears began to flow, she fell to her knees and begged God to show her the way.  She needed to understand what God wanted from her and what direction God wanted her to follow.  When the tears stopped, she suddenly felt a calm wash over her.  The following words started working their way into her consciousness: “You love who you [want to] love, and you truly be who you [want to] be.”  It finally hit her that it was okay in the eyes of God to be who she is.  During the interview, Katie shared that those words continued to bring a sense of calmness to her.  She could finally breathe as she thought about her relationship with God and her sexuality.     Although Katie began to accept herself and her relationship with God on the day she fell to her knees in tears, there were ongoing situations that caused Katie to feel unsafe in her sexuality.  When Katie moved back to a small conservative community, she tried to become more involved with her church.  She could not find a way to safely reveal her sexuality to certain people in her church. The church Katie returned to was still not accepting of the LGBTQ+ community.  As conversations were happening around her, she wanted to sink into the pew and hide.  She knew that if her reactions were visible, others would know that she was “one of those people.”  It was devastating to her to think that people could not love her for who she is.  She knows that God created her as she is, and she could not understand why people still cannot see that.     Katie sought answers from the church and looked for someone within the church that she could trust.  She hoped to obtain guidance on her sexuality and its meaning regarding her relationship to the church.  At the same time, she was sure that if she opened-up to someone, others would find out.  She was terrified for her own safety.    128   Katie finally found the courage to set up an appointment with the pastor of the church she grew up in.  His response was tepid at best, but he thanked her for coming forward.  He confessed that this was new territory for him and said he would try to find some answers for her.  This gave her hope.  Her hopes were soon dashed.  After several sessions, he told her that she did not belong in the church, that the church was for Christians, and Christians are to be married as man and woman.  Devastated by that conversation, Katie realized that she needed to walk away from the church. She knew she would never be accepted as a lesbian. The loss was overwhelming.    As time went by Katie received letters from people, including leaders, within the church. The letters asked her not to return. Some of the letters were threatening and took asking her to leave a step further by ordering her to get out of town.  She remembered one of the letters specifically telling her that God did not love her because she was going against God’s word.  She was also told that she was “going to die.”  She still holds on to the that last letter.  Although the letter makes her sad, she keeps it close to her because it gives her fight.  The letter reminds her that she is doing the right thing by being who God wants her to be.    Katie was terrified to go back to church and started to believe she would never be accepted in a church building or worship service.  Several months went by before Katie felt pulled back to the church.  In the interim, Katie sought answers in the Bible.  One day she found herself sitting in the church parking lot and just crying.  She desperately wanted to be a part of a church community and to repair her relationship with God.   She was very emotional when she described what happened that day.  As she sat in the parking lot, Katie felt completely alone but she still believed that she was following God’s direction to be who God created her to be.   Taylor’s friends used the church to try to lure Taylor away from his sexuality which they  129 viewed as a sin.  Taylor avoided coming out directly to his friends from church.  It was easier to distance himself from them than to face their judgement as members of the church.  Taylor could not find a way to make his personal life and church compatible.  Instead, Taylor drifted away from the church.  Taylor counted on social media to subtly reveal his sexuality by allowing others to see him in social settings with his boyfriend.  This helped him to avoid personal confrontations.    Katie and Taylor had counted on the church growing up.  When their sexuality came in conflict with the church, the church did not stand by them.  Several participants witnessed pain the church caused people they loved, including their spouses.  Those stories influenced how the participants experienced sexuality and the church, they are included in the next section. Loved Ones Hurt by the Church   Mia provided two stories about the setbacks people close to her experienced in the church regarding their sexuality.   Mia’s dear friend from childhood (Joy) had gone on to become a senior minster at a United Methodist Church (UMC).  As an out lesbian, Joy was “marrying gay people left, right and center.”  She was never contested by her congregation for presiding over these weddings, until shortly after Joy herself married a woman.  Within a short time after her own wedding, the church called her in and “invited her to participate in a role that didn’t have her preaching.”  Joy still identifies herself as a minister, but not as a pastor within the UMC.  It hurt Mia to be a witness to what this did to Joy.  Mia said Joy’s faith was a beautiful thing and Mia found it tragic that Joy’s faith was shut down because of her marriage.    Mia’s partner (Shawna) was so hurt by the church that she refused to return.  In solidarity to her partner, Mia has not spent as much time in church as she used to.  When Shawna came out to the church group she was closely connected to, she was immediately told that they would pray  130 for her but also told that God would hate her.  Mia does not feel like she can ask Shawna to attend church with her after the pain Shawna’s church community caused her.      Emily’s wife’s experience with the church was traumatic.  Getting her back through the church doors was a healing process they worked through together.  Her wife was kicked out of her church at age 16 because of her sexuality.  The church they were attending together at the time of the interview offered a place where they both felt accepted in a church home.  They did not have to change who they are when they walked through the church doors.     Many of the participants had church encounters that weighed heavily on how they viewed their sexuality within the church.  Three of the participants had strong positive experiences with the church.  Those stories are highlighted in the next section.     Positive Experiences with Sexuality in the Church   Selena’s story is unique in that she started her church experience at a very gay affirming church.  Her father was her biggest church influence and he attended church with his husband. Selena’s dad had been married to his husband for several years and they were an out couple within their church.  Because of this and because her church was open and affirming, she had no need to reconcile her sexuality with the church.      Selena attended a different service than her father due to her choir participation.  She recalled that at one point there were people at his service that refused to take communion from him because he is gay.  When members raised concerns over her father and his husband servicing communion during worship, this was Selena’s first real view of any negativity between the church and her or her father’s sexuality.  Because Selena attended a different service, she did not face this conflict directly.    Selena did not have a moment when she had to face coming out to her church.  She just  131 assumed that everyone had known all along and that her sexuality was a non-issue.  She shared that she was all about rainbows and glitter but ultimately, she was just someone who sang in the choir.   She was wearing a rainbow sweater during our interview and explained this was her regular attire when working at the church.  She remained with the church she grew up in through her senior year in high school before she pursued involvement as a leader in youth ministry.    Beyond the challenges that Emily faced with seeking ordination with her church, she had mostly found love and acceptance in the churches she attended.  When Emily came out, she had such a strong spiritual foundation that she never really considered her faith in crisis over her sexuality.  Her faith in God and God’s love for her is not something she ever doubted.  Although she believed the bishop in her early church was wrong in blocking her application, she respected his transparency.     Mia joined a comfortable Methodist church at the time of her coming out.  Mia faced some discriminating churches, but she never had a crisis of faith regarding her sexuality.  She pondered this.  The church Mis was attending focused on the positive and on being loving.  Because of this, she never had to ask the question “so God is no longer going to love me unconditionally, because I have a new condition?”     Facing sexuality with a church can be very difficult as demonstrated in most of the stories above.  Each of the participants, even those with mostly positive encounters at one point had to face the intersection of church and sexuality.  Those encounters carry over into more than just their church attendance, they influence their relationships with others and force them to wonder who it is safe to be out to.  The stories above demonstrate how the church played a role in how people face their sexuality, including forcing some of them to try to change who they are, and encouraging others to hide who they are when they attend church.    132   Some churches are open and affirming without being held to synod guidelines, but larger denominations must follow the direction of their denomination or separate from the denomination.  Two major denominations held national or global votes on how the church should respond to human sexuality including establishing policies regarding ordination and marriage.  Several of the participants shared their reactions to those votes.   In the next section I share stories of participants who were impacted either directly or indirectly by the church votes held by these denominations.   Churches Vote on Human Sexuality The United Methodist Church (UMC) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America both received significant press over the results of their national (ELCA) and global (UMC) votes regarding human sexuality.   Both churches landed with different outcomes from their votes.  The ELCA voted to affirm same sex relationships through a variety of declarations.  Contrarily, the UMC voted to uphold the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman and even voted to penalize churches who gave funds to organizations that affirmed same gender relationships.  Most of the participants were familiar with the votes held by the ELCA and UMC.  Two of the participants were directly impacted by the ELCA vote, and one was directly impacted by the UMC vote.  Some participants had similar experiences within their own denominations without a national vote.    Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA)     The ELCA vote hit both Jerry and Katie hard.  They both had to endure several sessions where members of the congregation got up and spoke against them when their church was pushed to vote on closing their doors to gay men and lesbians.  They were part of an ELCA church that called for a vote to leave the ELCA when the ELCA voted to allow the ordination of  133 ministers in long-term, same-sex, monogamous relationships. Although Katie and Jerry were part of the same church and attended some of the same discernment sessions, neither mentioned the other during their interviews and it was unclear if they knew each other or of the others sexuality.    Jerry was the most significantly impacted by the Evangelical Lutheran Church’s (ELCA) human sexuality statement and the fallout that occurred within his home church.   When the ELCA voted to affirm their human sexuality statement, Jerry’s church was the first in the state to call for a vote to leave the denomination.  It wasn’t until the ELCA started their nationwide human sexuality study that Jerry was pushed to face the conflict between the church and his sexuality.     Jerry had already started drifting away from the church because of his career.  He was still a member of the church he grew up in, and was confirmed at, but extended hours of weekend work made it easy for him to miss church.   Prior to the national vote, Jerry’s church held forums over many months.  There were meetings and campaigns on both sides with the most vocal being in opposition to accepting gay and lesbian ordination or weddings.     Jerry had friends who were members of this church.  Those friends convinced him to participate in and witness the forums during the discernment process.  When I interviewed Jerry, he knew the human sexuality study well and could quote from it.  He described it as having “two or three big things tied to sexuality.”  The two that drew the most attention from the congregation were: (1) to allow people in long-term, same-sex monogamous relationships to be ordained as ministers and (2) to allow the full acceptance of gay and lesbian members, including hosting commitment ceremonies and weddings for people in long term, same sex, monogamous relationships.  134 Jerry’s church held several meetings with members in advance of the nationwide vote.  The church was preparing to call their own vote to leave the ELCA if the ELCA voted (which it did) to adopt the sexuality study.  Two key items of contention within the study for some members of Jerry’s church included the recognition of long term same-sex monogamous relationships and allowing ministers who held these relationships to be ordained. The other key item was to allow ministers in the church to preside over same sex weddings.  Sessions on both sides of the issue were held frequently throughout the summer.  Many of the forums became very heated and included yelling and name calling.  At one point one of the pastors cussed at one of the members and called them a liar.     Most of the discussions were hosted by the pastors.  Some of the meetings were held offsite in member’s homes.  Because Jerry’s church was the first to call for the vote, the bishop of the state’s synod attended a few of the forums before, during, and after the vote.  Jerry spent the early sessions listening and absorbing as the members continued to make claims about the Bible and sexuality.  In one of the sessions Jerry decided to get up and speak.  Jerry gave examples of instances in the Bible with rules that are not followed or common today such as mixing fabrics.  He questioned why the members were picking and choosing which rules to follow.    Jerry’s most vivid memories of the sessions made him feel as if most of the comments were directed straight at him.  He was the only out gay person in the church at the time. Because of this, he became the focal point of the discussions.  He believed there was at least one other gay man in the meetings, but since that man was not out within the church, the burden fell on Jerry to take the hits.  He demonstrated some resentment towards the (still not out) person for not speaking up.  His story reiterated how unsafe it was for people to be out in the church and in his  135 small community – which he believes is still an unsafe place for the LGBTQ+ community.    Jerry could not recall anyone who stood up and supported him directly during any of the sessions.  He felt like the only gay man in the room fighting for himself and carrying the weight of other gay men and lesbians who sat in silence and fear.  He believed the number of closeted people far outweighed those that are out within the church and his small town.      Jerry recalled distinctly how one member looked him straight in the eye and said “Jerry, I don’t want you to think I’m a gay basher, but … [when referring to acceptance of the church’s sexuality statement,] this is not my beliefs, this is not the Christian beliefs, and I cannot support this.”  She continued with her case as to why the church should leave the ELCA.    Jerry entered the next session ready for a fight.  He was tired of all the attacks and was prepared to be confrontational.  He was sick of the members trying to justify their comments by qualifying them with statements such as: “This isn’t directed at you, but….” And “I am not a gay basher but….”    Growing up in a small town and having a career that touched nearly everyone in the community meant that Jerry knew everyone well.   He was confused by the hypocrisy of the church and community members.  The husband of someone he went to high school with led the charge to split from the ELCA.  He could not understand how this member could stand up and say, “My sister is a lesbian, and I love her unconditionally, but I would never want her to be a minister or preach.”   Jerry was offended when someone whom he considered a friend spoke up against the church remaining with the ELCA.  She looked at him and said: “You know Jerry, I can’t help the way I believe and the way I feel.  But it’s wrong.  It’s wrong to allow openly gay ministers in the church to preach.” She then described specific scripture passages she felt were part of her case  136 against allowing gay and lesbian support in the church.  Towards the end of her speech, she looked back at Jerry saying: Again, this isn’t anything personal because if me or my family or any of my loved ones or friends in this community ever get sick or injured, you are the first person that I want there, taking care of my loved ones. But if you were a minister, I wouldn’t want you to teach my children about the Bible.     Jerry was wounded by that statement.  He thought this member was a true friend, but her statements confirmed the friendship was only on the surface and only available when it suited her needs.  His immediate thought was, “I’m good enough to save your life, but I’m not good enough for anything else.”  When the church voted to stay with the ELCA and affirm the study, the woman was one of the nearly one third of the members who left the church for another Lutheran church.     Jerry vividly recalled that some of the comments and stories shared by the members did not make logical sense for the case to leave the ELCA.  The stories were meant to scare other members into voting against the sexuality statement.   Jerry recalled one older lady who got up and spoke for quite some time.  She shared a story about how her husband had been in the military and had returned a severely traumatized and damaged man.  She spoke as if she was the victim in this story.  She believed that gay men were responsible for molesting her husband in the military and used the story to declare that all gay people were known to be child molesters.   After months of sitting through meeting after meeting and hearing how he was putting their church in jeopardy, Jerry finally reached a breaking point.  He does not remember who was speaking at the time, or even what was being said.  What he does recall is that he stood up in the middle of the speech.  His mom grabbed his arm and pleaded with him to stay, but he turned to  137 her and said, “I can’t do this anymore,” and he walked out.  He was shaking as he stood outside on the steps near the church doors.  The man who had been speaking, came out and tried to smooth things over, but it quickly turned confrontational.  Jerry had “never wanted to physically punch someone in his life” but he was so angry with that man.  At one point a tiny older woman had to step between the two to stop anything physical from occurring.  Although he did not directly hear it, he was later told that someone did finally speak up for him in that meeting.   He was told that another member yelled at the congregation “You just drove away one of our flock, and you should be ashamed of yourselves.”     During one of the final sessions, the senior pastor got up to speak, he addressed Jerry directly, thanked him for coming and for being vocal. He thanked Jerry for not being afraid to answer questions from the congregation.  The pastor said that he was grateful for his participation and said it helped him process and understand where Jerry was coming from.  Jerry believed the conversation was going well and he started to feel better about where things where headed.  His hope quickly vanished.  The pastor concluded his statement with “But I just can’t accept this.”  That was the final thread holding Jerry to the church.  Jerry walked away that day feeling dejected.     He did have at least one advocate in his corner.  The associate pastor, who was an older woman, called him several times throughout the process to check on him and to show her support for him.  After the meeting where the senior pastor spoke up, the associate told him that she had marched into his office and gave her boss a tongue lashing.  She assured Jerry that she was 100% on board with him and said: “I just can’t believe that this is where we’re at.”    One of Jerry’s biggest frustrations with the meetings was that the greatest percentage of people in support were not getting up and speaking.   While he believed (and the vote eventually  138 showed) that it was the minority who were being the loudest and most vocal, he was very discouraged by what took place.  Jerry found it odd that those negative conversations were the ones he remembers so vividly even though the vote ended in favor of staying with the ELCA and accepting the human sexuality statement.  He believed he could list the names of every single member that spoke up against him.  The vote had taken place ten years prior, but Jerry described the meetings in detail and remembered the entire process as if it had just happened yesterday.     When the church voted to stay with the ELCA he stepped away from the church for a few weeks to understand what took place and what it meant for him.  He went back to work and continued “just not going to church.”  During that time, he watched people walk away from a church that they and their families had belonged to for generations.  Some of those who left had sat in silence during the forums.  When they chose to leave, their departure told him everything he needed to know about them.  Some of those who left were people he felt close to, people whom he considered friends.  Jerry had to reconcile his feelings towards them as he watched them walk away in support of discrimination.  When he sat in church during the vote, he recalled having zero indication that they were not supportive of him.  It hurt him to realize that they felt strongly enough about the sexuality statement to walk away from the church.  Many of them had been a part of the same church and sat next to him in the pews for their entire lives.     Jerry was shattered.  He had invested in relationships with people he worked alongside during medical emergencies.  Jerry could not believe they would not give him the opportunity to sit down and have a personal conversation about how they felt about his sexuality and the church.  They did not come to him with questions, they did not share their thoughts, they just left the church.  Jerry wanted desperately to confront them.  He wanted to ask him if they really believe that he is a second-rate person, that he does not deserve all the same things that they do.    139 In the end, he opted for silence because he believed those conversations would “go south really fast.” Instead, he bottled it up and tried to move past it.   The impact of the vote spread further than this one church.  Jerry’s hometown is very small, there were two other ELCA churches in the community.  Jerry’s anger and hurt spread to those churches as well.  He specifically called out the pastor who presided over the one church that voted to leave the ELCA.  He holds on to a lot of anger towards this pastor for letting that happen to his congregation.  The other ELCA church in town did not call for a vote.   When Jerry’s home church was discerning their own vote, the local churches remained silent.  Many of their pastors attended his church’s sessions but they stood at the back of the church and did not speak.  Jerry understood that their silence said a great deal and that not talking about it, in many ways was worse than talking about it.  Jerry believed that being forced to face the ELCA vote head on freed him from the hold the church previously had on him.     Katie was not out at the time of the meetings in her ELCA church.  She spent many of them in silence listening to her sexuality be demonized amongst the members.  She feared she would be outed if she spoke up in favor of staying with the ELCA.  Katie’s experience with other members of the congregation goes beyond what was said in the forums.  Members made it personal.  Katie married a transgender man. After the vote, Katie and her spouse received a threatening letter over their relationship and their church membership.     Katie no longer belongs to this church, but she still feels close to some of the members and found herself back there on a few occasions.  Many of the members who stayed are committed to supporting the LGBTQ+ community.  Katie and her husband have encountered love and acceptance by some of those members.  Not all members know her husband is transgender or that Katie is a lesbian.    140   When the church had to call a new senior pastor to lead them, they questioned the pastor’s commitment to leading them as an open and affirming congregation.  Although they do not currently belong to this church, Pastor Shannon is one they both consider to be a safe person to be out to.  Pastor Shannon had recently officiated their wedding.   It was important to Pastor Shannon to be the one officiating their wedding.  Just weeks before their wedding Pastor Shannon had been involved in a tragic accident and had been told that his accident would be life changing.  During his leave of absence, Pastor Shannon made sure that he was there to wed Katie and her spouse, and to bless them at the altar.     Katie and her husband talked about going back to Katie’s home church.  Unfortunately, she believed there were still too many members there she does not trust.  Several of the members were part of the early conversations and they contributed to the pain Katie felt during the vote to leave the ELCA. The vote was her first experience as a gay woman trying to find her way in the church.  She wasn’t ready to go back to that time or place quite yet.     Katie and Jerry both directly experienced the impact of the ELCA vote regarding their sexuality in the church.  Neither are still members of their home church even though that church voted to stay with the ELCA and many of the remaining members affirmed their commitment to LGBTQ+ love and inclusion.   United Methodist Church (UMC)   The UMC vote was still relatively fresh news at the time of the interviews.  The discussions were either crisp on the minds of the participants or they were not at all familiar with the UMC’s vote.  Jerry wasn’t directly impacted by the UMC vote, but he was very aware of its outcome. Jerry’s experience with the ELCA caused him to pay attention.  His interest expanded to his knowledge that some of the previous congregants of his former ELCA church had left to  141 join the UMC.     Nick and his spouse got married at a Quaker meeting, although they were members of a UMC.  Shortly after Nick and Calvin were married, his UMC church held an internal vote on same gender weddings.  The decision within his individual church (against the overall UMC’s stance) was to preside over same gender wedding ceremonies.  He described the church’s decision as determined and unphased by the national policies.  Most of his congregation just said, “We’re doing it.” There was very little fanfare or resistance from members in this church.  The church was never expelled, and the minsters were not stripped of their ordination status even though the UMC’s vote did not officially support gay/lesbian marriage or ordination of gay or lesbian ministers.   Nick’s church was considered an early adopter of being a reconciling and affirming congregation.  Aside from his UMC church and the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC), Nick was not aware of a single other church that was accepting of same gender relationships.      When the UMC held their international vote, Nick witnessed church lay people stand up and give testimony in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community.  In addition, some pastors had lost their ordination due to presiding over gay marriages.  The support of allies, and pastors gave him hope for the church.  When the final vote came in and the UMC vote did not go as he had hoped, Nick became very discouraged.  Many of the votes against becoming a reconciling church were coming from outside the country.  The results of the UMC vote pushed Nick further from the church.     Selena was not a part of the ELCA but her United Church of Christ (UCC) church held a vote within their own church on whether to become open and affirming. The UCC’s policy is different from the ELCA and the UMC.  Decisions on whether to be open and affirming are  142 determined at the church level, not the synod, district, or denominational level.    Most of Selena’s experiences within the churches she attended or served have been positive.  However, Selena experienced a few encounters which impacted her.  Several churches that Selena belonged to have participated in the discernment process towards becoming an official open and affirming church for the LGBTQ+ community.  During the discernment processes, Selena witnessed discussions that called into question her sexuality.   During one of the meetings, Selena vividly recalled a young person who stood up and confronted the congregation saying: “You do realize when you are speaking, you are talking about me right?”  Selena was very proud of the student for speaking up.  She understood how tough it must have been for a young person to sit and listen to conversations where members were trying to tear her down because of her sexuality.   Fortunately, Selena’s church chose to officially become an “open and affirming” church.  Some of the members of Selena’s church chose to leave because of the vote.     Selena believed the church has come a long way and experienced mostly positive interactions with the different churches she attended.  She still believes there is work to be done.  Selena wanted to see the church address the rituals of having men and women speak or sing different parts of the worship service. Selena also thought they should consider using gender neutral language, but she recognized that it would take time to make these adjustments.     Meghan was not directly impacted by either vote but was the only other participant to have a specific response to what occurred within the ELCA or UMC churches.  By the time votes took place, Meghan had completely separated herself from the church. She was very aware of the votes and saw the church as behaving badly towards the LGBTQ+ community.  Because of this, she chose to protect herself from any news or negativity surrounding it.  143   Both the ELCA and UMC are major Christian denominations.  The votes within each denomination directly impacted some of the participants and the news has influenced how other pastors and churches address sexuality within the church walls.  When the two denominations called for their votes, the gay men and lesbian participants experienced a exorbitant amount of turmoil as they had to face their sexuality in the church and were forced to listen to other members speak out against them.  The damage caused all three of the participants who were directly impacted by the votes to leave their churches.  Summary  Chapter Five included stories of how participants became involved in the church, how parents influenced that involvement and how their connections to the church led some of the participants to seek leadership roles within the church.  Participants were forced to either come out, hide or try to change their sexuality when conflict arose between the church and human sexuality.  Some went to extremes to avoid facing their sexuality within the church.  When the church discovered the sexuality of some of its gay men or lesbian leaders, authority figures drove those members from their roles or set up roadblocks to their pursuits.  Additionally, when two major denominations called for a vote to address sexuality, including marriage and ordination within the church, members were forced to sit through countless sessions where they felt persecuted.  This led to experiences of trauma and loss for each of them.     Following their encounters with the church and its members and leaders, each participant was forced to face the intersection of church and sexuality.  In the next chapter I will share the stories of where members are with their church and or spirituality today and what path they chose at the crossroads of spirituality and sexuality.   144 CHAPTER SIX: BELONGING Participants were deeply rooted in their church communities and letting go of that connection proved difficult for many.  They needed a community to replace the church when the members and leaders within the church made it more difficult to feel welcome.  Participants were ultimately forced to decide whether the church was still a home for them because of the challenges the church posed regarding their sexuality.  Each story contained a turning point in their journey.  Participants had to decide whether they could continue as members of the Christian Church.  Some of the participants were still searching for a church home, others felt they were supported and able to continue to call their church home while the rest made a complete break from organized religion.  Two of the participants no longer believe in a Christian God.  Figure 6 provides a roadmap of Chapter Six which included stories of how the community connection influenced how the participants experienced church and explored the details of where participants landed when they were pushed to make decisions regarding their spirituality versus their sexuality.

Most of the participants began their journeys as part of a Christian church to belong to a community.  As they navigated their roles in life and in the church, they either held on to their place of community within the church or sought to be a part of a community in other places or with other groups.  In this chapter I included the stories of where the participants landed in relation to their place in the Christian church.  But first I explained how they defined community, what being a part of a community meant to them and how that led to where they are now.   Church Community    As I listened to the stories, I heard from the participants that the community quality of a church was meaningful to participants regarding how they felt about their church history.   Participants viewed community connection as a major factor in what kept them tied to the church.  Whether they found community or are still looking for a church community weighed heavily on their choice to stay with a church or to leave for other communities. Community in the Church   Joe’s history with the church was extensive and the community he found within it consumed his early participation.  Joe spent most of his Sundays in the pews.  He also immersed himself in activities such as bake sales, craft or vendor fairs and even lock-ins with the youth group.  He viewed the church as a place where relationships were formed.  The mentors within his church community taught him a great deal.     Joe credits a large part of his early development to his involvement in the church.  When Joe was a part of the church, it was a powerful experience to be a part of a shared mission.  Everyone was on the same path, they all wanted to find ways to get to Heaven and to praise Jesus along the way.   He described how impactful the feeling was when he got to be a part of  146 something bigger than himself while sharing that experience with others.  He became visibly sad when he described how unfair and stupid it was that gay men and lesbian women do not get to be a part of all of that.  Instead of wanting each other to succeed towards that common goal, people within the church wanted to keep the LGBTQ+ community from it all.   Learning that he was not welcome in the church (through his school), sent Joe adrift.  Joe was still devastated by the loss of connection he felt to the church community, but he was also fueled by anger and resentment at the institution.   As we were talking, he started to question if the struggles he experienced in building relationships were caused by that sense of loss.      Joe described his time in college as a period where he felt totally lost.  He found himself establishing a different friend group every year.  If anyone got to close to him, he would push them away and reject attempts to build a stronger connection.  When he went on to grad school, he didn’t have access to meeting people and really struggled with depression and anxiety.   The pain and loneliness he was experiencing led him to consider suicide more than once.  He turned to therapy and was on a significant number of medications.  He shared that one of the things he struggled with most was in trying to make sense of his loss of community.     Without the church, Joe didn’t know how to connect with groups.  He was not interested in the gay bar scene, and he didn’t have a circle of friends that could lead to mutual friends. He found some hook-ups online but still felt empty.  He kept searching for any kind of human connection.  At the time of the interview, he described how difficult it was for him to have meaningful friendships or to trust more than the one or two people he is closest to.     Volleyball changed Joe’s life.  The social connections, the hierarchy of positions, the practice, and being part of a team, became the one thing that replaced the gap that not being a part of a church left within Joe.  To him, every aspect of what he could do as a young Catholic  147 boy could translate into being a gay volleyball player in his league.   Joe compared being a part of the volleyball community to the shared mission people have when they are part of a church.  He believed when someone is part of a team or a member of a community, they are all working towards the same goals.   Teammates are always in support of one another.  The support, encouragement and comradery of each other was an incredible feeling for him.   Joe played volleyball for another 18 seasons because of his sense of community to his team.   Joe found the tools and self-awareness in how to relate to other people through volleyball.  He did not suffer a loss when he left the volleyball circuit in the same way he experienced a loss when he left the church.  His time as part of a team gave him the confidence needed to take on the change.  He found a new purpose and a new community in performing drag.   He built a family within the drag community.     Joe expanded his community beyond drag performance by leading the charge to help others.  He utilized his new set of tools working with an organization that helps victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.  Joe was forced to find community outside of the church.  He built a family through his volunteerism and service.  He loved that he found a group connection where all are sharing in a common endeavor.  He explained that when the people you are with are on a shared mission, you get that same feeling as you do in church.  He described these new experiences within a community as being a part of something incredible.  Joe found confidence in his sexuality and emphatically said “Nothing will ever convince me that I am wrong in being gay.  Being gay is cool, being trans is cool. We know we are.”     Montana moved around a lot when he was young so being a part of the church community was how he met and stayed connected with other students.  He socialized with friends outside of his school through church activities and youth programs.  When he walked  148 through the doors at school, it felt safe to have people he recognized from church available to him.  He loved that they had a whole subset of friends from school that were also part of his church.   Montana’s relationship to his church community was the foundation for keeping his sexuality a secret during his yearly years. In addition to his fear of God I described in an earlier chapter, his link to his church community made it difficult to come out as a gay man.  He did not want to let the people down who had been such a big part of his life. He was afraid of being a disappointment if he gave in to “this kind of thing.”  At 15 years old, he had this group of friends that he did not want to lose because they would not approve of his sexuality.     Montana’s father was abusive, he smoked and drank and would then beat them up.  Montana and his sister would go to church the next morning and together they found healing from the bad things that were happening within their home.  He was already hiding enough.  His family did not have “money or looks” so he felt he had a lot of hurdles to overcome in being a part of his church friendship circle.  He did not believe that any of his friends or peers were facing similar pain in their homes. He was holding out hope to get out of home at a young age.  In Montana’s young world, his church home was his safe place.      Montana was eventually sent to boarding school and found that his Christian friends were still his community connection.  He tried different churches and immersed himself in the activities.   Church was something he knew how to do, and it helped him stay connected to friends through church.     Selena’s story is unique in that she started her church experience at a very gay affirming church.  She found community within her church from as early as she could remember.  She remained with the same church she grew up in through her senior year in high school before she  149 pursued involvement as a leader in youth ministry.  She stayed connected and part of the church, in every church she attended by getting involved in youth groups and choirs.     Taylor joined the church to become a part of a community, he ultimately left because that community was not accepting of him.  He originally surrounded himself with friends who were active in the church.  When Taylor began to see the conflict between his sexuality and his spirituality, he found himself at a crossroads.  When the opinions of who he considered the “minority, but very loud” group within the church elevated, Taylor found it easy to walk away. Taylor did not want to face his friends with news that he was leaving the church, or the news that he is gay.  He did not tell anyone he was leaving.   He did not want to have to explain himself.  Taylor considers his separation as self-inflicted and not caused by any stance that the church has taken against sexuality.  He did feel some embarrassment and even shame at the time, but it was not a difficult transition for him.     Sometime after he had walked away from the church, a couple of Taylor’s friends reached out.  They had seen him with a man, and they told him he needed to come back to church to get right.  That interaction stood out, but he laughed and shrugged it off.  Taylor believed that community can be found almost anywhere.  He understood that once you find a group of people working to achieve a common goal or fulfill common interests, their only loss from leaving the church is in its teachings.  He believed there were lots of opportunities to find purpose outside of the church.     Meghan’s only regret from leaving the church was the loss of community.  Meghan was one of four participants that I met through a fitness community.  Meghan was deeply engaged in this community and even led several subgroups.  During the interview she spoke of how meaningful that community had been to her.    150   Meghan’s story raised the question of whether members who have lost their church community connection will be able to replace that connection with other communities that are more accepting of LGBTQ+ persons.   Participants who shared stories of strong personal connections to their church community, either struggled deeply when their church communities let them down or they held on tight to their church regardless of their experience.  Some members looked for ways to be more comfortable with their sexuality in the Christian church.  The Rainbow church has opened its doors wide to the LGBTQ+ community, but it could not always offer everything the participants were looking for. In the next section, participants describe their experiences attending a gay-embracing or “Rainbow” church.   The Rainbow Church  Several participants shared their experiences with what they termed as the “Rainbow church.”  Although many of the participants attended churches that were open and affirming, four shared what it was like to attend a church that fully embraced and celebrated the LGBTQ+ community.  Some specifically attended gay embracing church worship services, others opined on how they viewed the “Rainbow church.”   Three of the participants would consider attending a gay embracing church if they could find the right one.    Participants had mixed reviews of their experiences with Rainbow churches.  While several found them to provide a safe space, others who had attended at least one service, found them to be reverse exclusionary.    Mia was on a quest for a church where she could find acceptance and meaning.  One day, she was driving and came across a church that had a 20-foot pride flag, “beautiful flag” hanging on the side of it.  She pulled in to check it out.  The church was a United Church of Christ (UCC)  151 church with a lesbian pastor.  She learned that due to city wide ordinances they could not keep the same flag up year-round, so they have a constant rotation between the Pride flag and a Black Lives Matter flag.  She immediately thought “This is someplace that I belong, that I can be a part of, so I can get outside of my head, listen to others, knowing that most of them don’t want me dead.” She went to her first service that Easter and became a full member by July.   Meghan had an extraordinary experience with the Rainbow church. Attending worship at an inclusive and gay embracing church helped her heal after her breakup.  She credited this church with demonstrating the power and significance of acceptance in a church community.  When Meghan’s career forced her to move back to the south, it became much harder to find a welcoming and affirming church.  Meghan described her friend circle as being 90% straight, so she has not sought out an all-gay church, but she would consider attending again.  For Meghan to return to church she would have to find one that is just as inclusive and accepting of her sexuality as the Rainbow church that had helped heal her.  The church would also have to be one where she could attend with her wife and feel comfortable sitting next to her and holding her hand in the pews.    Montana has a friend who is an active participant in a “Rainbow Church.”  He was excited to think about attending a church that was all about being gay, but he has not found one to try yet.  He believed that if there is a space that is accepting of everyone, helping them feel great about who they are and one that is completely inclusive, he could get behind that.   One gay pastor reached out to Montana to invite him to attend his church.  Montana is not sure he is ready to go back yet. He questioned if he would still feel the same way if he attended a gay church.  He might attend if he could slink in and out of the church without a lot of fanfare or attention.    Selena always felt comfortable and welcome in the Episcopalian church she grew up in.   152 The priest had even held a commitment ceremony for her dad and his then boyfriend back in 1995 before laws recognized them as a married couple.  She described fondly that they were able to comfortably hold hands and be themselves in church   Because her church had been a leader in that space, she never felt like she had to pay attention to additional conversations around the church’s stance on sexuality.  She appreciated that church was just church to her and that her church did not have to address the topic because it had been decided long ago.    Selena always felt welcome for who she was at the Episcopalian church she grew up in. Selena came back from her South Dakota mission trip wanting to know more about the United Church of Christ (UCC). Selena attended her first UCC service shortly after she returned from the mission trip. She discovered that this church felt like home to her.  She quietly made a permanent transition from her home church to the UCC the summer before college.        Nick was one of four participants who believed the “gay church may be too gay.”  He tried to attend a Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) which is known to be a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community.  He enjoyed the service.  There were moments that were powerful and meaningful for him.  At one point Nick became very emotional.  He burst into tears when the pastor reminded him that he was loved unconditionally and for who he was. But he felt like the focus was more on being gay than on God.  Nick knows that being gay is part of his identity, even a core part, but it was not what he wanted to focus on when he attended church.  He wanted to focus on his spirituality.  He has straight friends and they “don’t just sit around talking about gay stuff” so he was not necessarily seeking that within a church.    Nick was searching for something in the middle.  It was important to him that his church home was reconciling and affirming.  He wanted to know that his ideal church would preside over gay/lesbian weddings and allow ordination of gay/lesbian ministers, but he did not want the  153 spotlight shown on sexuality.  For Nick, changing times had influenced this decision for him.   Nick recalled how at one point in time, gay men and lesbians migrated to neighborhoods that he referred to as the “gay ghetto.”  These communities were places where the LGBTQ+ people could feel safe because they were surrounded by others who were like them.  These communities would have gay/lesbian bars and places for LGBTQ+ people to congregate and be themselves. Nick never wanted that for himself, he wanted to feel like he could be a part of the “general population” and not segregated from others.  Nick viewed the gay church as just another form of separation.  Nick described his desire to be reminded that God loves him, but he did not always need to hear that God only loves him because he is gay.     Colin’s roots were deep within Catholicism and did not seek out attending a gay affirming church as he saw them as non-denominational, which could not provide him with the rituals and spiritual roots he had wanted to keep with his Catholic heritage.      Taylor lives near a “gay church” but has never wanted to attend.  The turn off for him in attending is that by embracing and celebrating his sexuality, they are also being exclusionary to the heterosexual community.  He does not believe that is the right approach to achieving equality in the church and for finding love and acceptance by God for all of humanity.      Vanessa opined that she did not “need to be gay in church” so she wasn’t necessarily searching for a Rainbow church.      George has sought out Rainbow local churches in his community without any luck of finding one.  If George could have found one that was truly accepting and affirming, he would give it a chance.     Katie said she would love to find a Rainbow church.  She shared that if she found a place like that, she would be able to cry inside the church rather than the parking lot and she would be  154 okay from that.     Participants had a variety of experiences or thoughts on the Rainbow church.  Selena was the only one whose church could be considered gay embracing, that had found a permanent home in this type of church.     After addressing their place of community with the church, most of the participants reached a breaking point where they had to make choices regarding their church membership.  In the next sections the participants share where they are now with their connection or separation from the Christian Church.       Intersection of Spirituality and Sexuality  The intersection of spirituality and sexuality provided several pathways to choose from.  Each option was not an easy choice, and some participants were unsure what path was the right one for them.  Three of the participants were still searching for a way to stay connected to a church that will welcome them and accept them for who they are.  Only three members were still fully committed members to churches. Two struggled to believe the church could ever make them feel welcomed and loved so they walked away.  For those that left the church, three found spirituality in other ways.  One participant severed all connection to the church and no longer believes a God exists.  Those stories close out the data chapters of this study.    Still Searching   Three of the participants are questioning whether they will ever be able to find a church home where they belong, but they were not ready to give up on church.  They were caught between wanting to be a part of a church community, and not being sure it is possible.     Vanessa’s experience in the church is full of twists and turns.  The challenges she faced at school, the Catholic church’s response to the AIDS crisis and the loss of friends because of her  155 sexuality, caused Vanessa to walk away from the church for quite some time.  She did not believe the Catholic church had space for her.  With one exception, she has otherwise never considered going back to the Catholic church that she was raised in.     Vanessa did return to the church one time during a crisis.  She was devastated by the events of September 11th, 2000.  When the Twin Towers went down in New York City, Vanessa knew she needed to find her way back to the church.  Vanessa considered New York part of her home and her sadness at the events of September 11th was overwhelming.  She turned to the one place she knew she could find solace and comfort.  She immediately found an LGBTQ+ friendly church.     Vanessa found this church also offered a Catholic foundation with a Catholic message.  The church could not officially become part of the Catholic denomination because of their affirming and welcoming stance on the LGBTQ+ community.  Worship services were held in a Catholic church building, but it did not have an official home because it was not funded.  Eventually the Catholic church started closing their doors and would not provide this church the space to hold worship services.  Vanessa was suddenly reminded that even when she needed the church the most, she just did not belong there as a lesbian.  She once again walked away with no intention of returning.    Vanessa credits her wife, Marlene, for guiding her back to the church.  After a tumultuous first encounter back, Vanessa and her wife were ready to give up on ever finding a permanent church home, but their Catholic roots kept pulling them back.      When Vanessa and Marlene had found themselves in a new community, their new home was near a little church that was just down the street from them.  They talked extensively about going but never got around to it.  One day while Vanessa was traveling, Marlene chose to go and  156 had what she described as a fantastic experience.  She couldn’t wait for Vanessa to get home so she could share in her joy.  Marlene knew that Vanessa would absolutely love this church.  She begged for them to go together.  Vanessa decided to check it out one day when Marlene was out of town.  Vanessa also had an amazing experience at this little church.  When Vanessa and Marlene finally chose to walk through the doors together as a couple, the people responded by being “absolutely lovely” to them.  Marlene asked Vanessa to formalize their membership to the church, but Vanessa had some nagging questions that she needed to address before she would consider it.     Together they met with the minister.  The questions Marlene asked of the minister were functional and not related to sexuality.  After Marlene had finished, Vanessa jumped in and enthusiastically declared “Now it’s going to get fun!”   She got right to the point asking: “Are you okay with gay people in your church?”  The minister responded with “Well yes, but there is an open and affirming church, you might be happier there.”  The minister went on to explain that while he would always welcome them, if what she was asking him was if he was okay with gay marriage, then his answer would be no.  He went on to state that he would open his arms wide for them, but he would have to work on his own stuff before he could become fully affirming.  Vanessa appreciated his transparency and felt like she could work with that to start.    Vanessa and Marlene had attended the little church for quite some time before they had to move away.  Something transformational occurred for all of them at their final service before the move.  Vanessa became very emotional when she told the rest of this story.  During this final service there was a moment that changed everything for her.   Through her tears, she went on to smile and laugh as she said, what happened next is the “best story ever.”     Marlene had never been able to participate in or accept communion at any previous  157 church she had attended.  During their very last worship service in this church that had become their church home, the minister who had been “working on his own stuff” walked towards Marlene to give her the very first communion.  Marlene was finally ready to receive God’s gifts.  As he placed the body of Christ in Marlene’s hands, he said to her ‘this is the greatest gift God could give me on Easter Sunday.”  The rest of the service went on as usual.  But suddenly, mid-mass the minister stopped.  He paused and then went on to share how much he learned from Marlene and Vanessa and how much he was going to miss them both. Vanessa cracked as she said “There are no words to express my gratitude for him…. It changed everything.”   It was an Easter miracle to her and a moment she never thought she would see.     Vanessa and Marlene’s defining moment is one that they will treasure forever but it is also one that guides how she sees the church and its role in sexuality.  She declared “If I didn’t think I already understood how we need to approach allyship in the church, that was it.”     After Vanessa and her wife Marlene left that little church, they moved to the West Coast and began what Vanessa described as seven years of hell.  They hated it there so much that they didn’t have the time or energy to even look for a church.  The bar was set too high. When they were able to escape, they moved to an area that Vanessa described as “super gay” but at the time of the interview, they hadn’t yet begun to look at churches.  She believed that when they are ready to go back, they will look at both Catholic and Episcopalian churches.     Vanessa explained that it would not be easy to find a church that will make them feel loved and welcomed in the same way that the little church down the street made them feel.  She has had enough negative experiences both within the church and from hearing others speak for the church that she is not actively seeking a church home.     Vanessa was gutted when she heard people who represent the church say things like  158 “love the sinner, hate the sin.”  She struggled to wrap her head around how the church that is supposed to be centered on love, could be so judgmental.  Vanessa described one of her biggest fears to be the pace the church is losing the young people that could be making a difference.  She believed that young people are leaving the church because they see it as a place that does damage to gay people.  She asked why they would want to be a part of that?    As part of her career, Vanessa is sometimes a panelist in discussion sessions on topics such as sexuality or religion in the workplace.  During one of her sessions a lesbian minister got up to speak.  The minister shared that she was aware that in the next month she would be brought up on charges and removed from her post because she is a lesbian.  Vanessa was still struggling with that message.  She said, “What a horrific thing to hear someone say… here is this woman, up here doing amazing work, about to lose her job and she said it with such calm and peace.”  This woman was a leader of a massive church in Hollywood and was losing her ability to reach others with Christ because she is a lesbian.  Vanessa described that panel discussion as “absolutely, positively heartbreaking.”     Vanessa was very confident in her relationship with God, but she believed that was connected to her through with her work and her activism.  She used her work to find the right voice to speak to people about her Christianity and to be an activist in the LGBTQ+ community.  Her career as an advocate in the workplace across the country for the LGBTQ+ community provides corporations the tools to create gay straight alliances and to promote compassion and equality in the workplace.    Vanessa was grateful that she did not feel alienated by God.  She described that as the most important thing to her.  Vanessa was deeply saddened by those who were abandoned by their church and who believe that God no longer loves them because of who they love.  In her  159 work, she finds bits of hope everywhere.  She found a blogger whose posts are keeping her connected in faith.  The blogger’s work is all in allyship and Vanessa wanted everyone to check out his work to regain faith in everything again.     Katie struggled to find her place throughout her time as a member of the Lutheran church.  Katie left her home Lutheran church after the church voted to stay with the ELCA. Although the vote was in favor of the LGBTQ+ community, Katie withdrew from her home church because she did not feel safe.  The conversations that occurred during the vote were contentious and left her feeling like the church hated her.  She was afraid to speak up because she worried that she might “out herself” during the sessions leading up to the vote.   She had to sit and listen to people speak out against the LGBTQ+ community as they said harmful things about her and/or the LGBTQ+ community. Katie knew there were others there that needed her, but she could not risk taking a stand, she was not ready.  She witnessed people she grew up with say hateful things.  Katie struggled to reconcile her relationship with some of her long-term friends that were part of these conversations.     After receiving hurtful letters from the congregation and from board members, Katie wondered if she would be better off finding a spiritual path that allowed her to keep her relationship with God but didn’t require attending services.  She searched for a path that would not require attending worship services with people who may not accept her. She spent nearly six years after her original crisis, pursuing ways to stay connected with God that would not require church attendance.  The hateful messages didn’t stop.  She received more letters and hate messages via social media, even after she stopped attending church.  The letters and messages were not anonymous.  Katie lived in a small town which forced her to find ways to avoid facing the authors of those letters and messages.  The letters caused her to question if she was going to  160 die at the hand of God because of her sexuality.  The idea of committing suicide made her feel in control of her own fate.  She believed at the time that if she just did it herself, it would make everything better.    When Katie started dating, the women she was with attended church, but Katie avoided attending because of her fears.  Katie believed that her inability to attend church may have destroyed several chances at longer term dating relationships.  She assumed that if she had found a church that was a safe space, that maybe things would have been different for her dating relationships.    When Katie started dating her now husband (who is transgender) she shared that she was pursuing a way back to the church and wanted him to explore that with her.  She could not shake the nagging dread that others believe God did not accept them for who they really are.  Katie and her husband attended a non-denominational church together.  They have a mixed relationship with the members of their current church. Some were accepting. Others were open about their disdain for their relationship.  The members who object were not afraid to confront Katie and her spouse over their beliefs that Katie and her husband’s relationship is still “the biggest sin that anyone could ever do.”   Katie continued to seek a church where she and her husband would be embraced for who they are.  She asked herself:   Am I okay being somebody who wants to love God, who wants to love Christ, who wants to have a relationship, who is gay? Can I go to church and have that be one of my safe places, worship how I [want to] worship, worship how the church worships?    She needed to find a church that was accepting of her.  She also needed to feel like the church believed that God loves her as she is.  She wanted to be able to sit next to her husband in  161 the pews and hold hands as a family.  They had not found exactly what they were looking for in a church yet, but Katie believed that progress was being made and she held out an inkling of hope.  In the church they were attending at the time of the interview, Katie and her husband had been told that they were accepted and loved.  She believed this to be at least partially true.  They both remained guarded and questioned if they really belong at this church.  Katie struggled with trust.   When they were planning their wedding, the church sat them down and said: “We love you guys, but we cannot promote this, so we will not be at your wedding.”   She was emotional when she shared this story.  They were crushed by this news.  Prior to this conversation, they had both felt like they were in an “amazing place” only to be torn back down again.     Katie and her husband were eventually married in the church Katie grew up in. They were no longer members of this church because of what Katie went through there, but Katie does know that she has allies in that church, including the pastor who officiated their wedding.    Katie still viewed herself as a member of the church.  That said, she often feels like her God and the one she hears about in the church are two different gods.   The one she was close to, the one she sang to in her car, is one that loved her for who she is.  The one she often heard about from her church is one that loved her but saw her relationship as a sin.  She was still searching for the church that can reconcile the two.     Nick was leaning a little closer to breaking from the church altogether, but he still had questions about where he fits spiritually.  When he moved to the Northeast, he continued to seek out a church home.  He attended a reconciling and affirming Methodist church, but it was big and attracted public figures.  In selecting this church, Nick had two pieces of criteria: (1) proximity and (2) acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community.  He was no longer active within the  162 church because he was still struggling with some of his past experiences.  He spent a lot of time wrestling with the overall Christian church’s stance on sexuality.  He was not sure there was still a place for him in any Christian church.  He claimed that he would not go so far as to consider himself agnostic.  He did however question whether the Christian faith was the only answer.  He believed in God, considered himself spiritual and said he would generally still classify himself as a Christian.     Nick attended a few Quaker meetings with his husband but that was not the right fit either.  Nick and his husband were living closer to another Methodist church at the time, but the church was not reconciling and affirming, so they avoided attending.      Nick researched and read several books about sexuality and the church.  Nick used his research to better comprehend why there is such resistance within the church towards sexuality.  He learned that people tend to choose certain passages of the Bible to support or justify their convictions or beliefs.  Most of these texts are taken out of context and the meaning is misunderstood.  Nick found a better understanding of where others are coming from when it comes to spirituality and sexuality because of the books he had discovered.  After reading a book on “proof texting” he gained an understanding of how people can read those passages or hear them quoted by others and turn those into beliefs that God does not approve of his sexuality.   Nick’s biggest struggles with the church had less to do with his sexuality than with the church’s teachings on hell.  He was taught that Christians believe that anyone who is not a Christian is going to hell.  He cannot reconcile the theory that other religions are going to hell just because they do not see God through the same lens he does.       Nick believed that Christians are not living out Christianity as he was taught to live and treat others.  It was his conviction that if they were, they would focus more on serving the poor  163 and showing love for each other.  Nick attributed part of his struggle with joining a church to the fact that when he donates, a percentage of those funds are sent to the “main church” and the main church may not support him.  When the church Nick belonged to voted to become a reconciling and affirming church, but the overall UMC voted to be exclusionary, he was forced to consider what would happen to the funds he donated to support his affirming church.  The church’s stance on his sexuality influenced his attendance but not his faith.  Nick believes living out your faith comes through actions.   Vanessa, Katie and Nick each demonstrated a connection to the Christian church that still had a hold on them, and they desired to find a church that would demonstrate the love and acceptance for who they are that they believe was foundational to the Christian message.  At the time of the interviews, they had not found a permanent church home, but they had not given up.   In the next section, the participants who remained committed to the church share why they stayed and the challenges they still faced.  Church is Still a Home  Three of the participants considered the Christian church to be where they belonged.  Two of those participants experienced early acceptance and love throughout their Christian journeys.     Selena had mostly positive experiences with the church.  She continued to be comfortable as an out and open lesbian. She attended and actively participated in the United Church of Christ (UCC) which has a history of being open and affirming.    Selena felt comfortable with her sexuality in nearly every church she attended or worked in.  As a leader with the youth group, it was well known and accepted that she was a lesbian.  The associate pastor at the time was also an out lesbian.  The associate pastor’s wife sang in the choir.  Selena’s congregation knew the  164 associate pastor and her wife, but most did not see them as a couple.      One of Selena’s roles within the church was to present the children’s message every year for Coming Out Day.  She used her personal story and shared her Pride parade photo during the message. She described her experience with enthusiasm.  She was happy with her church home and her role within it.  She was considered one of the most visible members of the church and could be spotted wearing her pride t-shirt on most days on the church campus.   She explained being out as a leader within the church as “no big deal” and did not believe it was something other members discussed.     Selena’s best friend (from the nursery) continued to attend the church they grew up in.  Selena often migrated back there to visit.  At one point her dad got in an argument with his pastor and stormed out of church and never returned.   He soon found a different church to be a part of.  When Selena pictured herself, every image included being a part of the church.  She considered being a part of the church as part of who she was as a person.  Selena and her dad both felt fortunate to be surrounded by a plethora of open and affirming churches to choose from.    Emily viewed her experience as an exception to the experiences of other lesbians in the church.  Originally, she did not believe that she could honor her sexuality and still be a minster for God.  She chose God over her sexuality and set aside who she is.  Emily was applying for scholarships and preparing to enter seminary when we met.  Her pursuit was not always easy, and it took several years for her to obtain confirmation of acceptance.   While she waited to begin seminary, she remained very involved in the church and hosted education programs both in and outside her church.     Emily’s wife, Shania, was a police officer.  Emily and Shania together led a Christian study for law enforcement women who suffer from PTSD.  They call the group the “big fat  165 lesbian home Bible study.”  Emily faced some tough conversations as the co-leader of that group.  Members of the home Bible study shared the rifts they had experienced between the church and their sexuality.   These lesbian women all wrestled with the trauma because of breakups between themselves and their churches because of their sexuality.  The women in this study group were not part of a church home but attended their study to keep their faith alive.  They had all at some point felt rejected by the church.  Shania and Emily consider themselves a safe space and provided a bubble of shelter and comfort for these women.  Most of their attendees still wanted a relationship with God but they could not find a church home because of who they love.     Emily could not understand how some Christians could treat others the way they do because of their sexuality.  Emily believed evangelism was just “loving people into submission.”  She had a responsibility to those women to show her faith as love.  She was grateful that they trusted her.  She appreciated their willingness to tell her their stories. Because of their trust in her, she could help them realize that they are deserving of a relationship with Christ.  She consistently searched for ways to assure them that sexuality is not about something they have done, it’s who they are.  She wanted them to know that Jesus loves them as they are.     Emily witnessed so much hurt in her encounters with these women and saw it as an honor to be trusted with their healing.  It was her mission to ensure they understood that their sexuality did not make them inherently sinful.  They were not eternally damned in the eyes of the church.  The message Emily wanted them to feel was one of hope and love.  In her service to others, Emily observed many women have a crisis of faith due to their sexuality, but Emily never experienced that.  She did not let the bishop who tried to stop her application derail her calling.   She found another path to pursue her ministry.  For most of Emily’s life, she witnessed faith  166 played out in a demonstration of love for all people each week during worship.  That is where her roots were planted.     Mia wanted to stay with the church, but only if she could find one that would accept her as her authentic self.  When Mia left for college, she started seeking a church that would meet her needs. Mia had been searching through different churches and had attended five different undergraduate institutions, she knew she had to get away from the Lutherans, but she felt very strongly about faith.     She started attending Quaker meetings.  She felt almost immediately as if she had found her place and her people.  The Quaker meetings focused on prayer and meditation.  “If God moved you, you stood up and spoke in the moment.”  Their message was one of acceptance.  She shared: “You come as you are and if you like that, then you will be one of them.”  The Quaker people emulated who she wanted to be.  With the Quakers, everyone is equal before God which was vital to Mia’s vision.  The Quakers believe that there is something of God within everyone that cannot be drowned out, hidden or shamed.  Seeing women in leadership roles was impactful to Mia’s decision to make the Quaker meetings her church home for several years.    When Mia moved from the East Coast to the West Coast, the Quaker meetings were very different.  The room was hot and stuffy, and she could not be comfortable and did not feel at home there.  Later Mia went to visit a friend at her Methodist church and loved that the church flew a Pride flag at the entrance.  She described her whole church visit as being very beautiful.  She stayed with that church for two years.   When she returned to the Northeast, she went back to the Quaker meetings, but found that as a graduate student, she didn’t have the time required to sit and contemplate “her navel.” Quaker meetings do not contain music.  She also missed the music that is found in traditional  167 churches.  She quickly discovered that being a Quaker and a graduate student were not a good mix.     Mia eventually resumed her search for her place in the church.  During her search for a church home, she had specific criteria for what she needs. She was adamant when she said that she wants nothing to do with being a part of a “Missouri Synod-like” church.  The Missouri Synod’s stance towards women and their stance on sexuality weighed heavily on her decision to step away from the church.  Her priorities became that the church was big enough to have a good organ, rich enough to pay a good organist, and a place she would not “get kicked out of” because she is a lesbian. She eventually found an open and affirming church to attend.   Mia was caught somewhere between seeing the church as her home and understanding that she does not need to be a part of a worship service to have a relationship with God.  Mia eventually found a partner that is not a Christian, so she has since distanced herself from the church.  Mia’s partner had an experience with the church that was extremely painful.  Because of this, Mia does not feel like she can ask her to come worship with her.  She does go back to worship periodically (maybe a couple of times a year).  Her heart is still there, she knows the church is still serving the community and doing things she cares about (such as setting up a homeless camp) as she keeps up with the church communications.  She still considers the UCC her church home.    Mia stayed in contact with her church community.  Mia missed attending church but especially missed the people.  She said what she missed most is “listening to voices other than her own, interpreting the same information.”  There was beauty in the scholarship of it all.  She considered herself a member and a part of that church community, even though she no longer physically attended.  Based on the experiences of Mia’s friend Joy, and partner Shawna, Mia  168 struggled with the people within the church, but not the idea of attending church.   Spiritual but Not Part of a Christian Church   Three of the participants shared that they want to continue to have a relationship with God but are no longer a part of organized religion.  These participants considered themselves happy to keep their relationship with God just between God and themselves.    When Colin was searching for someone to share his life with, his therapist told him that he probably wanted to find someone in his church.  There was a local non-denominational gay church he considered attending but Colin did not want to give up his Catholic faith.  He wanted to continue to raise his daughter in the Catholic church when she was with him.    Colin tried to reach out to his priests for guidance on his sexuality and for help finding his place in the church.  His priests did not stray from the messages they gave him during his youth: “Praying a number of prayers and saying them over and over again, and just asking God to give me strength not to have those feelings anymore, and not to act on my desires anymore.”   Colin was shocked by their response but never challenged them on the guidance they provided him. He was torn and conflicted and a bit lost during that stage of his life.  At the time, being a part of the Catholic church was all he had ever known.    Colin’s epiphany occurred when he picked up the book Conversations with God by Neil Donald Walsch (1996).  The author taught him that it was okay to question his faith.  Neil started to ask important questions about his relationship with the church: “How can I embrace a religion who doesn’t embrace me? How can anybody tell me that I’m not worthy just because I love another human being who happens to be of my sex?”  He wondered if he could ever again be a part of a church that didn’t believe in him just because of who he loved.     Conversations with God (Walsch, 1996) opened Colin’s eyes to seeing his relationship  169 with God with a different light.  He continued to pray.  His prayers were often Catholic because of familiarity.  Eventually Colin found comfort in a more casual approach to prayer.  He began just saying whatever he wanted to say to God and not following a formal prayer process.     Colin eventually accepted that if the church could not embrace him, he could not continue to immerse himself in the Catholic faith.  When he let go, he started to feel good about being “different.” He no longer saw himself as a “freak” for questioning the doctrine of the Catholic church.  Colin credits this book series with helping him break free of Catholicism.  A huge weight was lifted from his shoulders. He let out a chuckle as he recalled that once he broke the shackles of the Catholic church, he no longer believed he would “rot in hell for the rest of eternity”     Colin eventually had to explain to his parents how he was feeling about his relationship to the Catholic church.  Being Catholic was deeply rooted in their beliefs.  When Colin’s parents came to him with excitement over preparing his daughter for her first communion, he realized it was time to help them understand his break from the Catholic Church.  He and his ex-wife (who was not Catholic) had determined that they would allow their daughter to choose her own religion.      Explaining his struggles with his place as a gay man in the Catholic church was too difficult for Colin to articulate on his own.  Instead, he asked them to read the Conversations with God (Walsch, 1996) books.  While Catholicism was still very important to them, he was determined in his new conviction and would not allow them to push him back to the church.   Colin proclaimed that he did not understand how anyone including his parents could blame him for not being Catholic.  He could not keep attending where he didn’t feel welcome just because he loved someone the church didn’t approve of.  He asked them how it could be  170 wrong to just want to love someone.  His parents really had nothing more to say about it.  Although his break from the church was difficult for his parents, overall, they were supportive of his sexuality.  He believed he was extremely fortunate, and he was grateful to them for their love and support.    Colin’s break from organized religion did not mean a break from God.  He still felt like he had a strong relationship with God.  He credits his strong foundation in being raised within the Catholic church for his ability to maintain that relationship and still believe that God loves him for who he is and who he loves.     Colin reiterated that he believes in Jesus, and the Virgin Mary and believes all roads lead to God. He held no animosity towards his Catholic Faith. He just no longer believed in the entirety of its teachings.  He now believes the focus should be on being a good person.  His faith was guided by the foundation that people should treat others with kindness, compassion and love.  According to Colin: if you avoid hurting others, show kindness and are not evil, then all are deserving of God’s grace.  He felt good about his relationship with God and did not believe he needed to be a part of a church to continue his spiritual journey.    When George moved back home after leaving his role with the church, he tried to attend a local church.  The church he found did not publicly share a policy or stance on sexuality so he felt like he could let his guard down a little.  He found some comfort there.  As time progressed, George could not let go of the hurt from his previous experience.  George was traumatized by what took place when he was a youth pastor.  He shared that regardless of what church he tried to attend, he held on to an “irrational fear” that he would be recognized as the gay man who used to work at his former church.  The feeling that he was on the verge of being discovered as that disgraced gay man from another church kept him away from believing there was a place for him  171 in the church.  He also had a nagging fear that his advocacy as part of the LGBTQ+ community meant he should not be attending Christian worship services.  Those fears kept full participation in church at arms-length.  Having a relationship with God was vital to who he is. He just felt safer maintaining that relationship in private.     George missed the rituals.  He longed to be a part of the community, serve others and listen to the sermons. He did not think he could handle being hurt by the church again.  He recently tried going back to a more contemporary church.  He described that experience as uplifting and spiritual.  He explained how he still found so much beauty in the liturgy and fell in love with the contemporary style.  After attending a few services, he uncovered that the church he was attending, did not allow women to vote, so again he walked away.     It took quite some time of separation and healing, but George was finding his way back to connecting with God.  He described himself as a “Christian mystic.”  His relationship to God was present but still quite rocky.  He was recovering from extensive trauma caused by the church.  He felt like over the past three years, he made significant headway. He was rebuilding his relationship to the church and seeking to find a connection to God beyond the walls of the church.   George discovered other avenues to connect to God.  His practices were more spiritual in nature than focused on church worship and attendance.  He listened to liturgical podcasts and found that the podcasts have played an integral role in repairing his faith.  The progressive Christianity demonstrated in the podcasts, including pushing back on the rules of purity have given him the space he needed to heal.  He has chipped away at the walls built up meant to protect himself from the harm other church members have caused him because of his sexuality.    George stayed connected to one professor from his college. She reached out to him on  172 multiple occasions and wanted to support him in finding his way back to the church.  She encouraged him to return to the ministry.  George has found healing via the combination of her support and his listening to liturgical podcasts.  He considered his relationship with God dramatically improved.  He believed that his healing could provide hope for those within the LGBTQ+ community and could help others establish a faith connection with God.    Meghan’s spiritual roots run deep but she had quite a journey getting back to a place where she felt her relationship with God was on solid ground.  After her devastating break-up and some healing time had passed Meghan started searching for a church to return to.  Some of Meghan’s friends invited her to attend an inclusive church which she described as an extraordinary experience. It was in this church that Meghan began making peace with her relationship to God and the church.  She found a community that accepted her and her sexuality.  She was shocked but felt at home when she witnessed other gay men and lesbians worshipping alongside straight people. Everyone supported each other and accepted Meghan for who she is.   Meghan chose a job that took her back to the South after many years living in a more progressive area.  When Meghan started seeking a church in the South, she would attend services where she would hear the common phrases many in the LGBTQ+ community hear during worship: “Love the sinner, hate the sin,” or “God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,” and “Homosexuality is an abomination.” These words pack a powerful punch and many church goers shield themselves behind them when they justify their treatment of the LGBTQ+ community.   Meghan was told that if she gave in to her sexuality, she was lusting after her own sexual appetite, which is considered a sin and “God doesn’t love sinners.”   She began to once again question whether God could love her and if she would be dammed to hell because she is a  173 lesbian.  These harmful messages were coming at her from the pastor as well as the members of the congregation.  As she sat and listened to a pastor preach from the pulpit that homosexuality is an abomination, she reached her breaking point. She said to herself “You know what, [f-#] these people.  I am not going to subscribe to that” and walked away from the church.    Meghan’s parents eventually started to question their own beliefs within their church and finally came to accept Meghan and her wife.  They recognized that they had raised a wonderful woman and that God loved her for who she was.  Meghan had lost her mom recently and shared how wonderful their last conversation was.  Her mom had been warm and loving to Meghan’s wife.  Meghan found great hope and healing when her mom thanked her wife for taking such good care of Meghan.  Losing her mom was devastating but the meaning she found in those final moments they shared contributed to Meghan’s healing.    Meghan faced a lot in the past several years, the bad break-up, losing her mom, losing a meaningful job and strained relationships.  She believed that having a relationship with God, praying daily and practicing gratitude did not have to be done within the walls of a church that would not accept her.     Meghan was at peace with her relationship with God even though she could no longer picture herself attending church.  She saw herself as having a stronger connection to her faith and to God than those who attend services regularly.  Meghan had what she needed, a strong relationship with her spouse, her Bible and worshiping God on her own terms.  At the end of Meghan’s story, she did show one small sign of regret. She knew the one thing she was missing while she worshiped God alone was community.   She could not find that sense of community when she sat alone and prayed at home or in a hotel room during one of her long work trips.    Meghan believed the political sentiment of the past few years, really turned up the anti- 174 gay sentiments in church.  Because of this, she did not feel safe walking through the doors of a church she did not know.  Meghan felt that lack of safety may permanently keep herself and others away from attending.     Meghan stated several times throughout the interview that she was done with the church, at peace with her relationship with God and no longer needed to worship God within the walls of a church.  She did come back later and contradict those statements.  She hoped to one day find a place like what she had in the Midwest where she could be a part of the church in an authentic way.    Several of the participants seemed to be at peace with their spirituality and separation from the church but showed signs that they might consider attending the right church should one exist.     Montana was caught in the middle.  He saw the church as more of an educational tool and a moral compass but did not feel the need to be in a spiritual relationship with God. He did see the value in raising kids with a church background, but he was not seeking a connection with the church that failed him. Because Montana has mostly severed his relationship from the church, I shared more of his story along with others who have more permanently severed their relationships with the church in the next section.  Separation from the Christian Church  Four of the participants are not active in their church today and are not seeking a spiritual relationship.   Soon after Montana left home, he tried several different churches. He struggled to find one that fit.  He described the rituals of reciting the liturgy, standing up and sitting down, as feeling cult-like.  During his freshman year at college, he attended a church where he was one of  175 three white people attending.  The church was very welcoming and took them to lunch on a regular basis, but he never did feel quite like he belonged there.  He loved the singing, the joy and the energy that was part of the service, but he didn’t appreciate that the church had no set end time.  Services ended whenever the spirit moved the congregation to end.  He quickly decided that Sundays were needed as catch-up day.  He used that time to catch up on sleep or to study.   Montana appreciated all that he learned through Sunday School and church.  He loved what he learned about Jesus, he believed there is value in the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule.  Because of those valuable lessons, he still pictured himself and his husband raising their children in the church.  He credited the church for giving him a good moral compass.  There were a lot of bad things he may have given into early on if it had not been for church.   Montana struggled to reconcile the conflicted messages he received throughout his faith journey.  He was taught throughout his life that the church’s mission was to bring people into their ministry.  As he progressed through the church and began to recognize their stance on sexuality, he found that the message turned more towards calling people out than loving them for who they are.  When he saw that the church could not accept him, he knew it was time to step away.  Leaving in the end was easy “because of the gay thing.” When Montana first described his separation from the church he declared “I can, with no regrets, leave church.”  He shared his leaving was tied more closely to his personality differences than to the fact that he is gay.     Later in the interview, Montana indicated that permanent separation from the church might not be as easy as when he first walked away.  It made him very emotional to think that he might not ever go to church again.  The loss of community still weighed heavily on him.  The  176 foundation of the connection he felt to the church since childhood, still tugged at him at times.   Taylor would not consider his relationship with the church a break-up, it just became less important to him over time.  He joined and stayed during high school for the community and connection to friends.  After he left for college, he stopped looking for a deeper connection with the church or the church community.  He did not consider himself religious and no longer felt like he needed to be a part of the church community.  Taylor’s experiences with the church were never negative. His migration away was based on an internal shame he was starting to feel.  As he started to question his belief system, the stories shifted from being meaningful to something he described as “very Harry Potteresque.”  Taylor eventually determined that religion itself was not important to him.     Taylor’s friend group tried to pull him back into the church.  Their motives were less about wanting him to re-engage to the church community and more about hoping that church would provide him guidance on his sexuality.  They were constantly using love as a weapon.  Their argument was they wanted what was best for him in their eyes and the eyes of the church.  He felt their motives were not meant to be condescending.  In the end he grew tired of continuously having to explain himself and to tell them he wasn’t interested in returning to the church.  He questioned why anyone would return to that environment.  What he had longed for in a church was the community, now that he had found that elsewhere, he had no interest in ever going back.    It was important to Taylor that others understand that he did not think poorly of the church or see his story as one of regret.  The church provided him with a lot meaning.  He valued what the church taught him over the years.  Taylor credited a lot of the good in him today to what he learned in church and the church events he was involved in from an early age.  Taylor  177 treasured some of the friendships he made as a part of the church, but he believed his experiences have made it hard to establish real connections with people.  Taylor said:  “there are many things we can work together on, just not that one thing.”     Joe’s circle of friends became hopeful that change would occur for the Catholic church when the most recent Pope as appointed to the Catholic church.  Joe’s friends had some faith that the Pope would make space for the LGBTQ+ community.  Joe had already lost hope in the Catholic church and was not surprised when the Pope “reaffirmed some homophobic nonsense.”  Joe was very clear in his conviction of his sexuality.  “I just know in my heart that there’s nothing that will ever convince me that I am incorrect in being gay and whether that’s any relationship to evil or hell…I know they’re wrong. I know I’m right and they’re missing out on a good time.” He was also bitter towards the church, and he did not have a lot of faith that the church would ever be welcoming to the LGBTQ+ community.     Joe described his separation from the church as a part of him that was dead inside.  He spoke of the loss in a way that someone would speak of losing someone through death.  It was devastating to him to give up something that had been a part of him since birth. Joe struggled with the idea that there is no space to really talk about that pain.    Joe’s new community was in his connection to the drag community.  As a drag performer, there was a song that he wanted to “perform the hell out of!” The premise of the song was that salvation belongs to all of us.   He claimed that he is not connected to the song personally, but he believed he could tap into how people really feel.  He could use his performance to make the connection of salvation and belonging to his audience.     Although Joe has completely separated himself from the church, he questioned if things would have been different if he had witnessed adults in the church standing up as allies and  178 fighting for the gay community. He described getting chills hearing the story of a pastor who walked in their towns first ever pride parade.  He has personally moved on, but he was grateful for what that momentous gesture could mean for others.     No Church, No Spirituality One of the participants completely and permanently severed his relationship to the church with no possibility of considering a return. He walked away from the church and did not believe a God exists.    Jerry spent several weeks trying to process what had happened with his church’s vote.  He used that time to determine his place with the church.   Before Jerry’s final decision was made, the senior pastor at his home church was replaced.  The associate pastor (AP) used the opportunity to try to bring Jerry back to the church.  The AP begged him to come meet the new senior pastor, who was more forward thinking.   During that meeting, the new pastor looked Jerry in the eye and said, (about the members who had left the church): “That was a real chicken shit way of them leaving.”  Jerry laughed and decided that he really liked this new minister, but in the end, too much damage had been done.       Although Jerry grew up in the church, he never really saw himself as overly religious or rooted to the church.  Jerry started to make his separation from church as soon as he was out of high school and able to make his own choices.   Jerry completely severed his relationship with the church.  He believed he had always questioned the reality of Christianity, but he never really disbanded his beliefs until he was forced to.  After his church went through the process of voting on gay and lesbian acceptance, he became confident in his belief that God did not exist.  Jerry believed even if God did exist, he does not want any part in worshipping someone who did not love him for who he is.    179   Jerry’s final separation came about five weeks after his hometown church went through its vote on whether to leave the ELCA.  Although the church voted to stay, Jerry couldn’t reconcile what was said in the sessions leading up to the vote with what he believes.  “Too many things were said, everything that had gone on with the study, and the vote, and the people that had left” had given him too much to process.  He had taken the time to reflect.  He spent some time really analyzing the Bible and began to look at things through a more scientific lens.  The process challenged him to start questioning his beliefs.  As painful as those memories were for him, he also believed the experience shaped who he is today and why ultimately chose to leave the Christian Church. He ended his statement about his beliefs with: “There just wasn’t a belief there, not sure if there ever was.”   Summary Chapter Six included the stories of each of the participants connection to their church communities.  When those communities were challenged because of the church’s stance on sexuality, participants were forced to discern whether they could continue as members of a Christian church.  Each participant had a story that led up through multiple layers to get to where they landed within or outside of their churches.  Several of the participants had attended or were aware of churches that would embrace them and even celebrate their sexuality but that often was not enough for them to continue their commitment to being a part of a Christian Church.  Most of the participants still desired a relationship with God, yet only two of them are still actively involved in their church. Three of them will likely never return to church and one of them no longer believes in God.   Chapters Four through Six included stories that carried the participants from childhood experiences in the church to deciding as adults, if the church is still place for them because of their  180 sexuality.  In Chapter Seven I analyzed in what ways the theories applied to how the participants navigated their spiritual journeys and their encounters with other Christians along the way.                     181 CHAPTER SEVEN: ANALYSIS Gay men and lesbians face hurdles in building and maintaining relationships and finding a sense of belonging in a community.  Those challenges can be even more difficult when they are part of a Christian church where ministers, church leaders and members are not always welcoming and accepting of the LGBTQ+ community.  Some churches have policies in place regarding ordination of ministers in same sex relationships, allowing ministers to perform same sex or same gender weddings and even against serving communion to gay men and lesbian members.  Participants faced conflicts with their social identities, experienced and transferred unconscious biases and encountered stereotype threats in their encounters as past and present members of a Christian Church.   This study aimed to shine a light on how gay men and lesbians make meaning of their experiences within the Christian Church.  In this chapter I used the analysis of two major theories and one related theory to understand how interactions with other church members, authority figures, and ministers influenced the participants’ decisions to remain a part of a Christian Church.  Tajfel and Turner’s social identity theory (1979) was used to analyze how participants identified themselves as members of social groups in school settings, as part of a church (including youth groups and other church activities), and as part of the LGBTQ+ community.  Herbert’s (2013) unconscious bias theory provided a view into how the micro-judgements of church members and leaders they encountered as gay men and lesbians influenced their participation in the church.  Additionally, unconscious bias theory was used to analyze how the LGBTQ+ community responded to participants who are or were Christians.    Steele and Arson’s (1995) stereotype threat theory was used to analyze how participants adjusted to avoid negative perceptions of their sexuality postulated by members of the Christian  182 Church as well as negative perceptions of themselves as gay Christians.  Additionally, stereotype threat theory was used to provide insight as to how participants made decisions regarding whether to stay or leave a church based on the church members’ beliefs and perceptions of the participants as gay men and lesbians.  Social Identity Theory Social identity theory (SIT) was established in 1979 by Henri Tajfel and John Turner.  SIT explicates how participants navigate their membership within a group (Ellemers, 2017).  Participants shared stories of multiple social identities they carried throughout their lives.  Participants identified as members of a church, youth groups, worship leaders, volunteers, political campaigns, sports, activism, fitness communities, schools, and friendship circles.   Members establish their social identities when they take on the beliefs and practices within groups they belong to or participate in (Stets & Burke, 2000).   When gay men and lesbians grow up in the Christian church, they often hear phrases from Christian ministers and other Christians, such as “love the sinner, hate the sin” or “homosexuality is an abomination” or “God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.”  Messages from the church regarding sexuality began to resonate with the participants as early as high school - often before the participants began to recognize their sexuality.  Participants sat through Sunday School lessons where leaders required participants to confess or pray about their sins regarding sexuality.  Participants listened during worship services to their ministers praying about sexuality and for political leaders to uphold traditional marriage laws.   Later, some participants attended forums which considered the vote regarding whether to allow gay men and lesbians to marry the person they love and/or allow them to be ordained as ministers.  Gay men and lesbian members were forced to try to reconcile what they heard from  183 the church with their sexuality.  Social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner, 1979) sheds light regarding how participants wrestled with belonging when their sexuality conflicted with their identities as part of a Christian Church.   Social Identity Processes Three related processes determine one’s social identity: “social categorization,” “social identification,” and “social comparison” (Ellemers, 2017, para. 10).  Social categorization means someone is part of a variety of groups and not just visible as an individual.  Social identification refers to people who view themselves as part of a group and not just someone who is a bystander.  Finally social comparison is a process where people are ranked within their social groups according to a set social standard.  Participants were members of a variety of groups based on their membership and participation in groups.  As participants shared their stories, they named and described a variety of groups and communities they served. Each participant had some connection and participation in the church starting at an early age.   Whether or not they remained with a church, most participants shared stories of other social networks they immersed themselves in outside of the church, but some delved even deeper into church participation.  Vanessa, Joe, George and Jerry all became engaged as activists for the LGBTQ+ community. Joe found volleyball and became a drag performer. When people see themselves as part of a group rather than an outsider looking in, they start to identify themselves as part of a group, indicating their social identity (Ellemers, 2017).  Jerry provided insight into this theory when he described what happened when he started to drift away from the church.  He replaced his church identity with his career identity.  He spent all his time focused on building his career.  He viewed his career in the medical field as his connection  184 to his small town.  Meghan built a network through her involvement in the fitness community, leading several groups with similar interests.  The sense of loss Meghan felt when the church let her down, was replaced with daily interactions with a strong group of fitness enthusiasts.    Social comparison occurs when ranking is revealed within a social group (Ellemers, 2017).  When Mia’s Missouri Synod minister viewed her unmarried status and the confidence with which she questioned his sermon to be a threat to the church’s reputation, he asserted his authority and power by sending a letter to her mother telling her that Mia was no longer welcome to participate in communion.   Vanessa experienced social comparison when the school she attended lowered her ranks as a student unless she followed the requirements set for her to continue attendance.  Emily’s rankings were weakened by the bishop who denied her admittance into seminary.  Ingroup/Outgroup Conflict Members within their social networks or groups may become caught in a cross-over conflict when multiple groups clash with one another.  A power dynamic can build where one group may hold a dominance over another (Punt, 2011).  When the church is part of the dominant ingroup and gay and lesbian participants are part of the outgroup, it may pose challenges for LGBTQ+ members to solidify their social identities within the group.   Gay men and lesbians who are part of a church or school group who is working to oust members of the LGBTQ+ community may choose to respond in one of three ways: (1) accepting their position within the group and their role within it, (2) taking action to move up to the advantaged group or (3) challenging the group to work together to elevate the ingroups status (Taylor et al., 1987).  Participants who choose to accept their position may hide their sexuality or take a limited role within the church. Katie and several others hid their sexuality for many years to blend in as  185 straight members of the Christian church.  All participants except Selena and Jerry chose to date people of the opposite sex to maintain their ingroup status.  Emily knew she could not be gay and be a minister in her church, so she married someone of the opposite sex to continue her pursuit in ministry.  George demonstrated his commitment to remaining a member of his conservative church by participating in multiple sessions of conversion therapy.   Those who choose to act or move up in status, may switch churches to find one more accepting of them as a gay man or lesbians.  Vanessa drifted away from the church for several years and avoided attending until she one day found herself in an accepting church.  Vanessa and her wife were embraced by this new church, allowing them to become part of the advantaged group.  Katie left her home church even though she longs to return because she needs to feel welcome as a lesbian member of the church.  Emily moved areas and is attending a church where she and her wife are younger than the average congregant by many years, but she feels warm and welcomed and part of the ingroup.   Finally, those who are willing to challenge their status may fight for gay men and lesbian inclusion within the church.  Mia demonstrated this when she confronted the minister who prayed for anti-gay legislation.  Jerry took on this position when he attended the church forums during his church’s human sexuality vote.  Even though the church voted in favor of LGBTQ+ inclusion, the tole this fight took was too much for Jerry and he left the church.  Joe and Vanessa became advocates in their schools.  Vanessa and Montana both participated in LGBTQ+ advocacy in their careers.  George made the most progress in his personal journey in this area.  He went from participating in multiple sessions of conversion therapy to asking me to team up with him in his quest to bring the LGBTQ+ community members and conservative ministers together in listening sessions in mission to resolve the conflicts between the groups.    186 Ingroup/Outgroup Bias Members of a Christian church will work to maintain the positive image that people have of being a part of a church.  At the same time, gay men and lesbians may choose to hide their identity within the church to protect the image outsiders may have of their membership as part of the LGBTQ+ community.  This practice explains ingroup/outgroup bias where individuals need to maintain positive associations towards the ingroup (Hawley et al., 2014).  If gay men and lesbians don’t respond according to the rules of the ingroup, a conflict exists between the ingroup (the church) and the outgroup (gay men and lesbians), and ingroup hostility may occur (Punt, 2011).  According to Punt, allegiance and loyalty are required to maintain membership in the ingroup.   Mia was excommunicated and was not allowed to participate in communion because she challenged the minister on his prayers for anti-gay legislation.  Vanessa was required to meet with a priest to remain in school.  Vanessa, Joe, and Katie each experienced extreme hostility and death threats from others.  Vanessa received death threats left on her car.  Katie received a letter threatening her life.  Joe also received death threats as a student when he attended “the most homophobic school” in the United States.  George also faced hostility when he was asked to contribute to the letter that went out to his church denouncing his sexuality in the eyes of God.  Joe was bullied for being what others viewed as effeminate.   While nearly all the participants chose to hide their sexuality throughout their early membership in their ingroups (families, friendship circles, schools, and churches) two of the participants took extreme action to remain a part of the ingroup by participating in conversion therapy attempting to erase their identities as gay men.  Being a part of a community was important to most of the participants.  Members held on to the positive connections to their communities.  They hid their sexuality during their church  187 membership to avoid any negative connections other church members alleged regarding their sexuality as gay men or lesbians.   Religion and Social Identity   Warnke (2014) explained that hermeneutics can lead institutions (churches and schools) to require participants (gay men and lesbians) to take on a social identity that does not align with their personal identity.  Accordingly, the Christian Church and its leaders and members often shaped their interpretations of texts, leaving out context and surrounding language as a discriminatory weapon towards the LGBTQ+ community.   Each participant encountered an institution, either a church or a school, which expected them to assimilate being heterosexual by ignoring their sexuality for the sake of the institution.  Several participants heard quotes from members of the church such as “God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,” or that God sees their sexuality as an abomination, and “love the sinner, hate the sin.”  Each time someone within the LGBTQ+ community hears these messages; they are forced to question their place in the church because of their sexuality.    The Bible in Mark 10:6-9 states: “But when God made the world, ‘he made them male and female.  So, a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one body.  So there are not two, but one.  God has joined the two together, so no one should separate them” (New Century Version, 2005).  These verses are often used to proclaim that God would not accept marriage between same gender individuals.  The Evangelical Lutheran Church of America’s (ELCA) addressed these verses in their human sexuality statement.  The statement declared that marriage is about the promises between a couple to care, cultivate and nurture their lifelong, monogamous relationship (SSHS, 2009).  In the introduction of the study, the ELCA focused on the verses of Matthew 22:36-40 as their guide for addressing the church’s stance on human sexuality: “’Teacher, which commandment in the law is the  188 greatest?’  Jesus answered, ‘You shall love the Lord your god with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the great and first commandment.  And a second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’  ‘On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets” (SSHS, 2009, para. 1).  The ELCA’s social statement on sexuality used Jesus’s invitation to love God and love each other as their driving force in answering the call to address human sexuality within the church.  This foundation allowed the ELCA to make room for love and acceptance for the LGBTQ+ community within their denomination.  The study also recognized that some members would not be able to reconcile their beliefs on sexuality with the results of the study and asked that those (and all) members also be treated with love, pastoral care, support, and respect.   Two of the participants were part of an ELCA church.  Both of those participants had difficult experiences while the ELCA was discerning and voting on their human sexuality statement.  Neither of those participants remained with the ELCA church they previously attended (and had grown up in) during the vote.  Both sat through forums and heard members whom they had known their entire lives use the Bible against them.  Regardless of how many people spoke up in their favor and although the church voted to adopt the SSHS and remain with the ELCA, neither participant felt safe in their church.  Several participants were part of churches or institutions (such as Christian schools).  The churches and Christian schools they attended believed that same gender relationships were sinful.  Those institutions feed the beliefs that participants’ sexual identities were not compatible with their Christian church.  George was an extreme case in that he attended conversion therapy multiple times to attempt to “cure” his sexuality because of what he was taught by his church.  When his church found out that he was dating someone of the same sex, he was told that he  189 needed to get back with the church so that he could “get right.”  Emily pushed her sexuality aside because being a minister was more important to her than her sexuality.  Nick spent years trying to “pray the gay away,” so he could pursue a career with the church.  Even though Nick left his pursuit to be a leader in ministry, he kept his reasons for leaving a secret from the school and his friends.  Nick did not want anyone in the church to know that he is gay.   Religion and social identity impacted more than just the members of the LGBTQ+ community.  Allies and leaders were also often forced to respond based on their church’s or institution’s beliefs.  When I was the youth director at an ELCA church, I was asked directly what I would do if one of my students came out to me as gay.  There were parents who would not allow their students to attend my programs due to my support of the human sexuality statement.  I often had quotes from the Bible sent to me to convince me that I should not be in my position if I supported the LGBTQ+ community.  Parents grounded one of my students for several weeks because he got caught coming to church youth group.  This happened in direct response to my support of LGBTQ+ love and acceptance in the church.   Nick’s director was under pressure to report or expel students who came out to him.  To protect himself and the students, he would push them to affirm that they were asking questions on behalf of someone else.  The director informed Nick that he had made the right decision in not disclosing his sexuality and leaving the school because it was a threat to his safety.  The church and the school placed the director in a position where he was forced to push others to ignore their sexuality for the sake of religion.  Nick’s director revealed another role that religion played in social identity theory.  Nick’s director was conflicted with his church’s position on the submissive role that women were expected to play in his church.  He ultimately chose to switch  190 denominations because his original church did not align with his beliefs on diversity and inclusion for women and the LGBTQ+ community in religion.  Vanessa’s church revealed their expectations within the church by publicly praying for politicians to uphold laws regarding same sex marriage.  When the Catholic Church removed the demonstrators at the “die-in” during the AIDS crisis, they made it clear that even during a time of death and crisis, they did not support the LGBTQ+ community and the community was not welcome in the church.  In addition, after September 11th, 2001, when the Catholic Church closed its doors to churches that were holding welcoming services for gay and lesbian members, they showed how they expected their members to denounce their sexuality in favor of church membership.   Selena was the only participant who was firm in explaining she never experienced a reason to hide her sexuality or avoid being a member of a Christian church because she had always been a part of a gay affirming church.   Political Identity Political identity (Citrin et al., 1990) as a subset of social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) is still somewhat controversial and needs further vetting.  I mention it here because I believe there is some validity in the theory that may require further research and development to how it applies to the LGBTQ+ community.   As the political climate evolves on this topic, the church and politics remain intertwined on views regarding sexuality.  Political identity theory becomes evident when participants perceive worshipping a Christian God is a requirement to being a true American (Citrin et al., 1990).  Political identity conflicts with social identity when people see themselves first as Americans and second a gay man or lesbian.  Participants may have set aside or hid their sexuality from the church, but they did this because of their desire to be a part of the church.  None of the participants indicated that  191 being an American first was part of their social identity.  In contrast, several of the participants spoke harshly of the political climate they were in and indicated that it was difficult to be a gay man or lesbian when the President was working so hard against them.  Some of the ministers in their stories did connect their political beliefs to the church.  Participants fell victim to this theory when they encountered others who believed that being an American required believing in a Christian God, and in turn believe that God condemns same gender relationships.   When ministers bring politics to the pulpit, they are connecting their ministry to the nation’s politics.  Politicians in return often use the Christian Church as a weapon to reinforce their drive to create policies against the LGBTQ+ community. Vanessa’s and Mia’s church included political expectations regarding sexuality in their prayers.  Vanessa listened in fear and anger when her church prayed for the sanctity of marriage to be held to include only weddings between a man and a woman.  Mia sat in the pews of a Missouri Synod Church and listened to the minister pray for politics.  Although the Christian church often asks its members to ask God to watch over politicians as leaders, Mia’s minister specifically asked for God to guide senators to vote against supporting the LGBTQ+ community.  The nature of the prayers for political direction included an anti-gay message. When Mia confronted the minister about the prayer, she was excommunicated.   Vanessa, Joe, Montana, and Jerry all demonstrated taking on a political identity which either replaced or became more important to the participants than their social identity in the church.  Vanessa focused on LGBTQ+ advocacy in the workplace, and Joe was an activist in college.  Montana is a leader of the Pride network at his job and led the charge to provide gender safe restrooms at all company sites.  Jerry and George were very active in state and local politics  192 and ran for office. Jerry included his advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community in his political campaign, which proved difficult in a very conservative community and state.  “Black” Sheep Effect   Belonging to an ingroup can be very powerful and members are often very passionate and deeply rooted to their groups (Abrams et al., 2014).  The black sheep effect occurs when a participant poses a threat to the ingroup’s reputation or when they create negativity towards the ingroup (Hawley et al., 2014).   Participants experienced this phenomenon throughout their ingroup experiences.  Mia’s family attended a Missouri Synod church.  A letter from the church was sent to Mia’s mother telling her that Mia would not be allowed to take communion and would be damned forever.  Later, one of Mia’s pastors was asked to step down from her role as a highly successful senior minister because she had been performing same gender wedding ceremonies.  Taylor disappeared from his church friendships to avoid judgement from them because of his sexuality.  When they realized he was gay, not one single church friend stood by him, affirming his fears were justified.  When Jerry left the church, his ingroup became his small town.  Jerry replaced his fears regarding his sexuality and the church with a new worry.  Jerry feared being shunned by his community for being an atheist.   The members of Katie’s church fought hard against the ELCA’s human sexuality statement and believed that gay members put their votes at risk.  These fears led to threats towards some of their members.  The death threats that Katie received through letters from church members have kept her from returning to her home church even though the church voted to remain open and affirming.  Katie knew that her pastor and a few others were supportive of her and her spouse, but she was so afraid of the ingroup that they keep her from walking through the doors.  Instead, she found herself in the church parking lot in tears, longing to go in and be a part of the ingroup.    193 Joe’s and Vanessa’s schools were both so fearful of their sexuality harming their reputations that they went to great lengths to penalize them both.  They threatened the pair by warning if they did not follow the rules when it came to their sexuality and activism they would be penalized or must leave school.  Joe sought help from counselors at his school and they were bound by school rules and were not allowed to provide Joe the guidance he needed as a gay student.  Joe’s school principal told him the financial contributors of their school would not be pleased with a gay student, and therefore the principal could not support him.  Showing support for Joe would put the school at risk of drawing negative attention, placing a financial strain on the institution.  Vanessa was told by her school chancellor that she would be required to meet with the priest to fix her sexuality or Vanessa would be expelled.  Ironically the priest, who was part of the meeting between Vanessa and the school chancellor, turned out to be one of the priests caught up in a major sex scandal. This made Vanessa question how her sexuality was more terrifying to the school than pedophilia.    System Justification Theory System justification theory explains how individuals establish biases towards their social networks (Jost et al., 2004).  According to Jost et al. (2004), members invest themselves in their social networks and in turn struggle with how that may conflict with their personal identities.  Members may choose to hide or even try to change their sexuality because of their desire to be a part of the Christian church.  Members may then defend and justify harmful practices of the ingroup, even if that means they are personally harmed by those practices because of their personal identities (Jost, 2001).  George’s continuous participation in conversion therapy demonstrated his desire to follow the expectations of his church.  Most of the participants chose  194 to hide their sexuality from others because of what they learned from the church.   These actions demonstrated their need to hold on to Christian Church membership.   Blasi and Jost (2006) claimed participants may defend and justify their church’s policies and practices regarding sexuality even though they may be negatively impacted.  George did not believe his participation in conversion therapy was bad and said it had even been oddly helpful.  Selena had mostly positive experiences with the churches she attended and believed she could see the progress the church was making towards acceptance of human sexuality.  Taylor described leaving the church as self-inflicted and made it clear that it was not the church’s stance on sexuality that caused him to walk away.  However, Taylor did not tell his friends that he was gay. He believed that most now know because of social media and have chosen to sever ties with him because of his sexuality.  Those who chose to attend and participate in a gay embracing church maintained their connection to their social network as members of the church, without facing conflict with their sexuality.  Several of the participants explained that their LGBTQ+ friends who were harmed by the church became more deeply involved in LGBTQ+ community events.  Their friends replaced their need to be a part of the church with other community activities such as coordinating and attending Pride events and starting the “Big Fat Lesbian Bible Study.”  Moss (2016) stated that people seek stability in their social systems and if one of their social systems starts to fail them, they need to find an institution that would provide the stability they lack.  When the church and school started to fail him, Joe became suicidal, and needed medications and therapy to reconcile his loss.  Joe had to find stability in another source.  Volleyball became the social system that Joe clung too for 18 seasons.  Joe’s volleyball experience made him stronger, and this membership completely replaced his need to be a part of  195 the church.  When Joe’s time was up as a volleyball player, he easily transitioned into a stage performer.  This membership was strong enough to replace his previous social networks and set him free to express and even celebrate his sexuality.   The longer a person is a member of a social network, the deeper their roots extend within that network.  Blanchar and Eidelman (2013) declared that social systems that have been in existence for a long time are better able to justify their practices. The Christian Church has been in existence for centuries, which makes it more difficult for members to accept change or to challenge the belief systems.  Almost all the participants began their church experiences at a young age, making it more difficult to challenge what they were taught in the church, and even throughout their education, which in several cases included a Christian foundation.   Participants describe examples about the way the church justified its position. Many were willing to accept that they had to hide their sexuality during the early years if they wanted to remain a welcome part of the church community.  Except for Jerry and Selena, the participants were not willing to give up their belonging in the church by coming out to other members.  Jerry demonstrated frustration with his neighbor, a member of his former church, who was not out during his church’s human sexuality vote.  Jerry’s neighbor explained that his sexuality was not his only identity, and he did not want it interfering with his church experience.  Jerry’s neighbor saw his identity first as a member of the Christian Church and did not view his sexual identity as a social identity.   Colin, Nick, and Taylor shared similar thoughts when explaining that the separation between the church and their sexuality was why they were not interested in attending a gay embracing church.  Colin’s deep roots in Catholicism meant that he did not believe the gay embracing church could meet his spiritual needs even if it meant he would be embraced as a gay  196 member.  Nick mentioned that when attending church, he did not want a spotlight on his sexuality.  Taylor had no interest in attending because he believed the church should teach acceptance of all members and the gay embracing church separates the gay community even further.  That said, most of the participants chose to leave their early churches or find other churches in response to the ingroups practices and beliefs.  Participants found ways to navigate their social identities throughout their experiences in a Christian Church and during encounters with Christians. Those experiences shaped their decisions to remain a part of a Christian Church, find spiritual connections elsewhere, or sever their ties to the church.  As participants navigated their sexuality and spirituality, they encountered people who had implicit or unconscious biases towards either part of their identity. In the next part of my analysis, I explain and interpret how the interactions between the participants as gay men or lesbians or as Christians impacted their desire to remain a part of or to leave the Christian church.   Unconscious Bias Theory  Unconscious bias theory describes how we have a storage of built-up biases in our heads that we are blind to when we encounter others (Banaji & Greenwald, 2013).  According to Herbert, (2013) when a participant encounters another person, each individual experiences rapid responses to that encounter.  Rapid judgements during this interaction appear without the individual being able to fully assess the context or the source of those judgements (Sporek, 2015).  When a member of a church has been taught that being a gay man or a lesbian goes against the beliefs of the church, they are likely to make several judgements about the gay men and lesbians they encounter during the first seconds of their interaction.  Those judgements may impair the participants’ ability to embrace the gay man or lesbian for who they are and fully  197 welcome them into the church.  Although participants were not always aware of the biases when sharing their stories, they became evident when they described their encounters with friends, family, and church members.   Katie mentioned she wanted to be able to hold her spouse’s hand in church but feared judgement.  Because unconscious biases develop over time (Herbert, 2013), members may not even be aware of them, and the biases can be difficult to overcome.   Not all biases are negative.  Selena had positive biases towards the church because her experiences were mostly positive.  Selena grew up in a welcome and affirming church and experienced positive responses from her pastor and the parents of the youth she led. These biases made it easier for her to accept leadership roles in the church.  Selena felt immediately safe in her sexuality because her pastor had a pride flag behind his desk.  Although she had stated that she had never had a crisis of faith, she indicated that she carried some small biases of her own.  Selena described her concern when her head pastor told her he was leaving the church, she demonstrated some biases that she may not have been aware of when she described her fears that a straight pastor may not be as accepting of her sexuality.    Members of the LGBTQ+ community encounter negative biases when they interact with members of a Christian church, but they can also experience biases against them if they tell members of the LGBTQ+ community that they belong to a Christian church or that they are religious.  These biases can be demonstrated in everyday encounters, such as when Taylor walked into the room with a chicken sandwich in a bag from an anti-gay fast-food chain.  Taylor described the judgement he felt from the LGBTQ+ community because he was eating a chicken sandwich from a Christian food chain.  Vanessa mentioned that it was more difficult for some of  198 her work partners to talk about religion than to talk about sexuality.  Nick experienced these biases when his friends stopped interacting with him once they discovered he was gay.    It can be difficult for people to control or change their unconscious biases, even if they are making a conscious effort to do so (Lemm, 2006).   Vanessa’s pastor could not set aside his biases when he first met Vanessa and her wife.  Although he welcomed them to his church and invited them to be members, he was open about his belief that they should not be married.  Once Vanessa and her wife’s pastor got to know them both better, his biases melted away and he demonstrated that during their final service at his church.  It wasn’t until that final service that his biases were eliminated.  He demonstrated total acceptance when he embraced them both and offered communion to Vanessa’s wife for her first time. When those biases disappeared, it provided a powerful experience for both Vanessa and her wife, one they will never forget. Emily’s bishop showed unconscious biases when he did not allow her to pursue her acceptance into seminary.  Specifically, Emily’s bishop told her that her age and marital status were indicators that she was not ready for seminary.  The bishop was biased towards Emily’s sexuality, even if he didn’t state that explicitly. Nick believed that when his peers told him that every student would be asked questions about their sexuality in their post internship interviews, that they were projecting their biases on him.  When he reflected on that experience, he realized that they must have known that he was gay and therefore tried to coax him into coming out.  Instead, the rumors caused him to leave school without explanation.  Kite et al, (2017) explained that individuals place people into categories based on key learnings from their early years.   Cultural experiences in school, with friends, family members and organizations, such as the church, influence how they developed early biases they carried  199 forward into later encounters.  Church members who learned their church was not welcoming and affirming may make decisions on how they treat gay men and lesbians without being aware of their treatment (Sporek, 2015).   Once an unconscious bias is formed, it is difficult to control or change, even if a person is committed to showing support and acceptance (Lemm, 2006).  “Love the sinner, hate the sin” is often stated by church members and pastors.  This phrase is presented as a loving and generous gift to gay men and lesbians. Often members do not see it for the harm and damage it causes to LGBTQ+ members.  Often members lump sexuality as a sin in with sins such as having an affair, stealing, or even murder.  When Taylor’s friends tried to lure him back to the church to “get right,” they acted on the belief that they were loving him as a member of the church but as a sinner.   Church’s often use phrases like “All are welcome” to present an open-door policy to lure members into the church, but the “all” does not always come with the same level of acceptance.  The Missouri Synod church may open its doors for anyone to attend but only offers communion to its members.  Pastors who welcome members of the LGBTQ+ community into the church, may choose not to perform same gender weddings.  Vanessa’s pastor assured her that she would be welcome and loved as a member of his congregation but admitted that he had work to do to overcome some of his biases.   When the ELCA published their human sexuality statement, the bishop of Jerry and Katie’s state told their church that although the sexuality statement allowed churches to perform same gender weddings, the church would not be required to do so, leaving room for biases to grow within the individual churches.  That same bishop also declared during one of the forums that although he supported the human sexuality statement because of the vote, it went against his  200 personal theological beliefs.   The bishop attended the forums and tried to offer his guidance during the sessions.  The bishop provided his insights as the church discerned their vote, but he could not always hide his personal biases against same gender relationships in the church.   Unconscious Bias in Social Networks   People place themselves either as part of a group or as an outsider to that group (Smith, 2008).  When individuals get to know or establish relationships with people who are marginalized, such as members of the LGBTQ+ community, their favorable biases improve - especially the more closely they interact (Lemm, 2006).  This became clear in Vanessa’s story when her minister stopped his sermon and declared that Vanessa and her wife had given him a great gift in Vanessa’s wife’s acceptance of her first communion.  The ministers’ original biases were eliminated and replaced with a favorable bias toward them both.  Nick’s director got to know him when before he became aware of his sexuality by taking him in and caring for him when Nick had his wisdom teeth out.  Although Nick’s director believed Nick made the right choice for his own safety when he chose to leave the school, the director’s biases that he held as an employee of the school started to fade in part due to his relationship with Nick.  The director’s biases shifted due to the support of the gay students he had encountered through the program.  The relationships he established with those students made it more difficult for him to take the action the school would have required.   This shift ultimately led the director to leave the school and joining an ELCA organization which was more inclusive towards the LGBTQ+ community and women.   When George was pushed to leave his position, there were deep biases against him.  One person who was closer to George struggled with what had happened to him and reached out more than once to offer coffee and support.  During one of their later discussions over coffee, she  201 admitted the school had responded too quickly in requiring the letter to go out to parents that condemned his relationships. The initial reaction and response were due to their anti-gay biases and fear that George’s sexuality would harm the reputation of the church.  George’s church demonstrated their biases when they assumed that parents would be upset or fear the safety of their kids under George’s leadership.  The person who reached out to him had an established friendship with George which made it more difficult for her to support the church’s response.    Members of the LGBTQ+ community were often victims of biases that others held towards them, but they also established biases of their own.  Those who had a negative experience from their church or church community had stories about how they did not trust members of the church community.  Vanessa and her wife were afraid to try new churches because of the terrible experiences Vanessa’s wife had with the church. Joe described how he struggled to build relationships.  As he was on the receiving end of biases presented to him throughout his time in school, he also developed biases towards others, which kept him from getting to know others and allowing others to get close to him.  Joe and Colin each mentioned that meeting people was hard, they had their own biases even within the gay community.  Neither of them was interested in meeting people through the “gay bar” scene.  Nick demonstrated his unconscious biases when describing his reasons for not becoming a member of a gay embracing church. He felt like the MCC church was “too gay,” even though he had an emotional reaction to the messages coming from the sermons.   Unconscious Bias and Gender     Men tend to have more anti-gay biases than women do (Kite, 1996).  Men expect masculinity and respond with unconscious biases towards men who play a more feminine role (Deaux, & Lewis, 1984).  Most of the participants hid their sexuality for a significant portion of  202 their church and school experiences. Perhaps because of their hidden sexuality, there were not many examples of participants experiencing biases because of their gender or how they presented.  Joe was the one participant who described being bullied in school due to femininity.  Joe has since turned this into an art as a celebrated drag queen.    Each of the participants were either recipients or portrayed some form of unconscious bias in their encounters with members of a Christian Church regarding their sexuality or in their interactions with the LGBTQ+ community because of their Christianity.  Those biases influenced how they experienced being a member of those groups and played a role in their decisions to stay with or leave the church.  Stereotype Threat Theory  Stereotype threats occur when people develop fears that their actions will validate the negative stereotypes that others project onto a certain group (Roger & Aronson, 2009).  The group member worries that they may start to portray the negative traits perceived by those who hold the biases (Shapiro, 2012).    Most of the participants spent some time trying to hold on to their membership within a Christian church, and some took that even further by seeking ordination or other leadership roles in the church.  As participants grappled with remaining part of the Christian Church and faced biases in their encounters with other members and ministers, they were often pushed to change their behavior to avoid negative attention to themselves as part of the LGBTQ+ community.   When gay men or lesbians experience a perceived stereotype as a threat to their membership within a church, they develop fears of validating those stereotypes.  Katie validated her fears in her inability to name her sexuality and in her unwillingness to come out to her home church during their vote on sexuality.  Katie also demonstrated throughout the interview her  203 instinct to protect her husband who his transgender.  She spoke of fears she has of holding hands in her former church and explained that the death threats she received kept her from believing that she and her husband belonged in the pew of her hometown church.  George chose conversion therapy, and Nick tried to “pray the gay away” to maintain their church membership.  Colin and Emily married members of the opposite sex and George and Nick each dated or pretended to date members of the opposite sex.  These relationships presented a front to others discovering their sexuality. They all believed it was expected of them by the religious people they knew and that their membership within a church was threated if their sexuality was revealed.    Taylor and Nick avoided facing their friends. Taylor assumed his friends would find out by social media instead of coming out directly.  Nick left school without telling anyone he was gay.  Vanessa, Jerry, Selena, Meghan, Joe, Montana, and Emily embraced their sexuality and the stereotypes that came with it.  Group Concept Threat   Group Concept threat is recognized as a subset to stereotype threat theory (Steele & Aronson, 1995).  Group concept threat appears when people view themselves as the reason a dominant group may target the group they belong to (Shapiro, 2012).  For example, when Joe was bullied at a young age, he believed it was because he was outwardly more feminine than what his bullies deemed acceptable.  When Joe was called derogatory names, such as “faggot” by other students, he believed his effeminate appearance was the reason he was targeted and for their justification of how they viewed the LGBTQ+ community.  The two participants (George and Nick) who participated in conversion therapy believed that they were sinners as gay men, so they tried to eliminate their sexuality to meet the expectations of the Christian Church.  Katie  204 kept telling herself that dating women would be viewed as bad in the eyes of the church, she was afraid to be caught researching same sex relationships for fear of being outed.  Katie started to believe that she did not deserve to be a member because she had continuously been treated poorly by members of the church who did not approve of her sexuality.  Katie reached out to me after the interview and asked if God could really love her as a lesbian and if I had any resources that would help her understand that she is deserving of God’s love and if she deserved to be a member of the Christian Church.   Own-Reputation Threat  Shapiro (2012) explained that gay men or lesbians may fear they may be identified by the church as gay men or lesbians.  Katie said she did not want anyone within her church to know she was a lesbian, and she hid her sexuality from her home church.  Although Katie returned to her home church for her wedding, she still avoided attending her home church because of how other members made her feel when she was a member.  Katie and Meghan hoped to one day hold hands with their spouses in church but feared that the church would turn on them if they did.  Montana described his fear of letting people down.  He explained that he did not come out to his friends because he believed he would lose them if they knew he was gay.  Because he was in an abusive household, his friendship circle was his lifeline.  Taylor took his fears of being discovered as a gay man to the extreme by leaving school without telling anyone that he is gay.   Emily’s wife and several of their friends do not attend worship but instead attend Emily’s “Big Fat Lesbian Bible Study” because they fear what the church will do or say to them if they try to attend.  Several of Emily’s Bible study participants have had traumatic experiences in the church because of their sexuality.   Because of what happened to Shania (Emily’s wife), she would not step foot in a church again.  Jerry was out in his community and used his voice to be  205 an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community in his church and as a politician. Jerry was not afraid of being out in the community, but he was mortified to discover that people who would put their lives and lives of loved ones in his hands as a paramedic would not allow him to teach their kids in Sunday School or would not want him to serve them communion.  In addition to the shock, he experienced when trusted members of the community turned on him, he feared what the community would think of him when they discovered that he is an atheist.  Group-Reputation Threat     Group reputational threat manifests when a person fears that their behavior and membership can reflect poorly on their group (Shapiro, 2012).  There were limited examples of group-reputation threat in the participants stories, suggesting a need for further research on this topic.  Vanessa was the one participant who faced this when her friends were caught up in the troubles Vanessa faced with the school because of her advocacy.  When Vanessa and her friends campaigned to establish a gay-straight alliance at her school. Vanessa was devastated when she realized her two straight friends were in the same trouble as Vanessa because of the school’s response to Vanessa’s sexuality.    Responses to Stereotype Threats   Members of the outgroup are often forced to establish coping strategies to combat stereotype threats.  Shapiro (2012) explained that participants may begin to disassociate themselves as members of the targeted group by hiding their sexuality, or in extreme cases trying to erase their sexual identity.  George and Nick both chose to participate in conversion therapy to disassociate their sexuality from their desire to be a part of a Christian church.   Gay men and lesbians may remove themselves from the church to protect themselves from further harm by the members of the church.  After Jerry sat through several meetings where members of the church  206 spewed negativity and harmful messages about his sexuality, he left the church permanently.  Mia’s experience with the Missouri Synod led her to say she was done with that denomination for good.  Nick’s fears of being asked about his sexuality following his internship caused him to walk away from the church permanently.  Montana was afraid to discuss his past membership in the church with the LGBTQ+ community because he feared losing his “street cred” as a gay man, even though he still views his experience with the church as the reason he wants to be a good person.    Each of the participants faced some form of stereotype threat as either members of a Christian Church or as part of the LGBTQ+ community with a Christian background.  Navigating those threats influenced their decisions to remain with or leave the Christian Church.  Summary  Tajfel and Turner’s (1979) Social identity theory affected how participants viewed themselves as part of a community or social network throughout their experiences as gay men or lesbians in a Christian Church.  Most of the participants recognized themselves as members of a Christian Church before they identified their sexuality.  Some participants went to great lengths to hold on to their church membership or navigated to other communities to replace their identity as part of the church.  Participants experienced difficulties and pain as their connection to the church was strained or severed.  Some required therapy, and two of them became suicidal when they lost their connection to the church.     In addition to their social identities as members of the Christian church, some members faced conflict as Christians from the LGBTQ+ community.  Participants shared stories of being a part of multiple social identities. When those identities conflicted, which was often the case for gay men and lesbians who were also Christian, participants experienced pain and often were  207 forced to choose between one network over the other.  Many of the participants tried to hide their physical identity as a gay man or lesbian to remain an embraced member of their social identity within the church.    Participants faced unconscious biases in their encounters within their social and physical identities. These biases influenced the participants’ experiences when attending church and school as well as when they sought leadership roles in the church.   Unconscious bias theory (Banaji & Greenwald, 2013) was used to analyze how the encounters gay men and lesbians experienced with members and leaders within the Christian church influenced their decisions on church membership.  Participants used their experiences based on the biases they encountered to influence their decisions to continue their church membership, seek community or spirituality elsewhere or to leave the Christian church.  Unconscious bias theory also helped analyze why participants chose to hide their sexuality from their church or schools and from Christian friends and family members.  The biases participants faced made it difficult for members to feel safe in the church.  Their feelings of safety ranged from something as basic as not being able to hold hands with their spouse while attending worship services to looking around the church wondering who wished them dead.     Steele and Aronson’s (1995) Stereotype threat theory was used to analyze how participants changed their behaviors when in church to avoid the negative perceptions of being a gay man or lesbian Christian.   Gay men or lesbian Christians often faced extreme difficulties and pain in navigating their sexuality in the church and some went to great lengths to hide or even try to change their sexuality for fear of how the church would respond.     I used social identity, unconscious bias and stereotype threat theories to assess how participants experienced being a gay man or lesbian within the Christian church and how the  208 church’s response to their sexuality influenced their decisions to remain with or leave the church.   I summarize my study in the next chapter, describe the implications based on my findings, and include my recommendations for further research.  I share the limitations of my study and offer some ideas regarding how to reduce the challenges gay men and lesbians face in the Christian church, including gay embracing churches.                     209 CHAPTER EIGHT: SUMMARY, IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS “Then those people will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or alone and away from home or without clothes or sick or in prison? When did we see these things and not help you?’ “Then the King will answer, ‘I tell you the truth, anything you refused to do for even the least of my people here, you refused to do for me.’ (New Century Version, Bible, 2005, Matthew 25:44-45) In this study, I described the stories of gay men and lesbians who grew up as members of a Christian church.  I explored how participants navigated their church participation and handled their encounters with church leaders and members regarding their sexuality.  In this chapter, I summarize my findings, discuss the implications, and propose recommendations for further research.  I include a call to action for church leaders and intuitions seeking change regarding addressing sexuality in the church.  I also address the limitations of the study.  I conclude this chapter with my final thoughts. This topic took hold of me before I became a doctoral student at the University of St. Thomas.  I was the youth leader at an ELCA church when the church called to adopt the 2009, ELCA Human Sexuality Statement.  I was actively engaged and passionate about my desire to adopt the statement and I fought for our church to remain with the ELCA.  I upset a lot of parents along the way and lost friendships over my commitment to the statement, but nothing I experienced compared to what members of the LGBTQ+ community had to go through when the church was discerning the vote.  It was that experience that sparked my interest in understanding further what it must be like to be part of the LGBTQ+ community and a part of the Christian Church.  After hearing their stories, I became more convinced than ever that there is more work to be done in this arena and further research is required.   It is my desire that by reading their stories and understanding their experiences, Christian Church members will advocate for change  210 within the church to embrace the LGBTQ+ community and reject church and political leaders who use the church as a weapon against LGBTQ+ persons. Summary  I designed this study to shed light on what it is like for gay men and lesbians to be a part of a church or institution that resisted their full participation because of their sexuality.  Their stories painted a picture of the obstacles faced when coming out to their families, friends and students and faculty in school as well as church members and leaders. Members experienced hardships such as being ostracized by their friendship circles, losing their jobs as church leaders, getting kicked out or pushed to leave school, suffering suicidal thoughts and receiving death threats.  The participants agonized over their encounters with church members because their sexuality conflicted with the church’s position and policies. The church’s stance also infiltrated other areas of the participants’ lives.   All 13 participants spent a noteworthy amount of their youth as members or active participants in a Christian church.  Taylor was the only member who initiated church membership without the influence of a parent.  Participants attended, served and even led worship services, partook in Sunday School lessons and were active in youth groups. Some of the participants sought extensive leadership roles with the church by leading mission trips, attending Christian education, including seminary, and by becoming ministers.   The research is limited on the experiences of gay men and lesbians in the church.  This study confirmed the existing research that the church silences gay men and lesbians within their church walls (Anderson, 1997; Barret & Barzan, 1996; Barton, 2010, 2012).  As the participants immersed themselves in the church, they often heard messages from the pulpit and from other members regarding their sexuality.  According to Piazza (1999), religious leaders and many  211 mainstream Christians believe that you cannot be a gay man or a lesbian and a Christian.  This message heard from the participants at an early age, made it more difficult for participants to feel at home in their church as their authentic selves.   As churches held weddings and celebrated marriages only between a man and a woman, gay men and lesbians questioned whether they could marry the person they love in the church.  They also wondered if their children could be baptized if the church did not recognize their marriage.  Many of the participants had not faced their sexuality when they started to see and hear those messages from the church.   Statements regarding the beliefs of church regarding human sexuality caused harmful ramifications for the gay men and lesbians in the study.  Most of the participants chose or were forced to hide their sexuality in church and in turn had to keep secrets from the people they were closest to.  Same sex couples felt invisible if they attended a Christian church that did not affirm their relationship (Piazza, 1999).  Katie demonstrated this when she said she had no idea that two women could go out together as anything but friends.   Davis and Franzoi (1986) said it is dangerous to impose restrictions on sharing personal details of oneself.  Being unable to be open about your authentic self can lead to loneliness and isolation.  This was confirmed by Taylor who believed he was at a developmental disadvantage by not being able to be out for most of his youth.  Mia also experienced this in Sunday school.  She spoke of when she had spent time with students who she partied with on the weekends but in turn lied about their purity during their lessons that same Sunday.  Mia did not return to that church because of the damage the lies were causing.    Some churches use celibacy requirements to further push LGBTQ+ members to reject their sexuality as members of the church (Johnson, 1998).  George used the church’s stance on  212 celibacy as a reason not to sleep with his stand-in girlfriend.  He used her as a cover for his sexuality, while at the same time he was sexually active with other young men.  All but two of the participants hid their sexuality by dating or marrying the opposite sex.  Two participants attended conversion therapy, a very dangerous practice, now banned in most states.    Participants faced hurdles throughout their encounters with church members:  two were asked to leave school, one was denied admission into seminary by her bishop, another was excommunicated by her mother’s church, one was bullied extensively and two received death threats from church members.  Through all of this, the sense of wanting to belong to a community caused the participants to try to hang on to their place in the church.  For most, it eventually became too much, and several participants broke from the church.  I applied three theories to analyze their stories including Trajfel and Turner’s social identity theory (1979), Banaji’s (2013) unconscious bias theory and Steele and Aronson’s stereotype threat theory (2009).   Social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) was used to understand how participants identified themselves in social networks including their place in the church, their identity as part of the LGBTQ+ community and other networks formed within and outside of the church.  Social identity theory revealed how participants adjusted when their sexual identity came in conflict with their identity as members of the Christian church, students at a Christian school or part of a Christian social network. I then analyzed how the unconscious biases gay men and lesbians faced influenced their experiences when they encountered members of a Christian church or organization who may not be aware of the biases they portrayed.  When gay men and lesbians faced Christian members who demonstrated these biases, they felt marginalized in the church.  These encounters led the  213 gay men and lesbians to respond by hiding their sexuality from other church members, or ultimately pushed them to leave the church.  Christian gay men and lesbians also faced biases when they encountered people who were part of the LGBTQ+ community who had been hurt by the church.  LGBTQ+ members may have strong negative feelings about Christianity because of the way the church has treated them.  Their biases often appear when a gay man or lesbian tells them they are also Christian.   This can lead to additional turmoil for the gay man or lesbian Christian when they experience biases both from the church and from the LGBTQ+ community.  One of the participants said: “It’s harder for me to walk into a room of queens and tell them I am Catholic than it is to walk into church and tell them I’m gay.”   Finally, I described how participants responded when faced with stereotype threats.  The stories revealed how participants avoided being their authentic selves in church in order to evade scrutiny by other church members regarding the gay man or lesbian’s sexuality.  Participants were often afraid that their actions would bring additional biases towards the LGBTQ+ community causing further harm to the relationship between themselves and the church. The stories within this study supported the three theories mentioned about but they also opened the doors to further research and additional theoretical analytics.  During the interviews, I heard signs of trauma and loss theories that warrant additional review.   The participants stories exposed the many ways the church failed them. Their encounters with church members and other Christians led them to a crossroads.  They had to choose whether to continue Christian Church membership, seek spirituality elsewhere, or leave the church.   In the next section, I will describe the implications of what I learned from their stories.    214 Discussion and Implications The stories in this study provided implications for members, ministers, and leaders of a Christian church who are seeking inclusionary policies and practices for the LGBTQ+ community.   The findings of my analysis demonstrated that gay men and lesbians who grow up in the Christian church long for community, inclusion, safety and love that the church offers.  Unfortunately, they often do not receive the same love and acceptance that heterosexual members receive.  Because of this, gay men and lesbians spend a meaningful portion of their lives, hiding who they are.  Some of the participants went to extremes to try to change their sexuality in their hopes to remain in favor of the Christian church.   The church’s stance on sexuality starts within the church but reaches well beyond the church pews. It extends to family members, friendship circles, politicians and schools.  Institutional leaders (including politicians) often used the church’s stance on sexuality to exclude them or cause them emotional or physical harm.  Authority figures influenced family members and friends to follow the same exclusionary patterns of their leaders.  Participants then felt betrayed by the people they love, and they blamed the church.  Meghan was separated from her parents for many years after she came out to them.  Taylor’s friends used the church to try to change him.  Each of these encounters left a mark on the gay man or lesbian member of the church and led to permanent damage to their relationships. I organized my findings into three major themes, relationships, church practices and policies, and belonging.   Relationships  When faced with the intersection of Christianity and their sexuality, participants often experienced troubles with the people they encountered.  The participants transitions were much  215 easier when someone they could trust was in their corner and supported them in their sexuality.  For example, Mia’s mom first told her that she needed to find another way to be happy, but when Mia’s mom’s church turned on Mia, she took a stance in support of her daughter and left the church.  Likewise, Vanessa told her best friend’s parents that she was a lesbian, long before she told her own parents.  Vanessa’s life changing moment occurred when the minister she and her wife had come to know and love, fully embraced them as a couple and offered her wife her first communion.    Most of the participant stories featured examples where people stood by them which made their transitions easier, but each story also included examples of people close to them who hurt them, let them down or made them feel betrayed.  Meghan’s parents were very upset when she came out to them, this caused several years of contention between them.  Jerry sat during church forums and listened as long-time friends, colleagues and even people who would call on him to save their family members lives, turned on him because his sexuality conflicted with their church beliefs.    Having a trusted authority figure made a difference in the lives of the participants as they faced obstacles in being out Christians.  Joe relied on his English teachers to help him navigate the difficulties imposed by his school principal.  Nick’s director helped him heal after he was forced to leave his school rather than disclose his sexuality.    Authority figures pushed several of the participants away from the church.  When Colin shared his thoughts on his sexuality during confession, his priests all provided him with the same response - say Hail Mary’s and try not to think about it.  Joe’s principal told him that he was putting the school at risk because the school was funded by anti-gay contributors.  Vanessa’s  216 chancellor told her she would be required to quit her activism and meet regularly with a priest until she was fixed.    The participants in this study faced coming out to people they loved, admired or respected multiple times throughout their journeys in the church.  Often the responses the participants received were founded by how the person they came out to felt about their sexuality based on their religious beliefs.  Further research is needed to better understand how powerful the church’s message on sexuality is over all coming out interactions even beyond those that occur because of the church.  Church Practices and Policies  The stories in my study demonstrated how the church policies and practices impacted the participants.   The gay men and lesbians in my study had established relationships and connections with church members throughout their youth.  They experienced hurt and betrayal when those members turned on them in response to their sexuality.   Christians are taught that God loves them and created them for who they are.  That message became cloudy when the church started telling participants that God’s love comes with exceptions, and that it doesn’t apply if they love someone of the same gender.   Many participants provided examples of when the church turned on them.  Vanessa was shattered when her church did nothing when members were dying during the AIDS crisis.  Nick, Emily and George all ran into roadblocks established by the church when they pursued spiritual leadership positions.    The study reflected that the church weaponized others to use the church’s words against the LGBTQ+ community.  Politicians used the church to garner support for anti-LGBTQ+ legislation.  Some Christians felt empowered to threaten the gay men and lesbians because they  217 believed the LGBTQ+ community put the church at risk.  Leaders let heavy funding from anti-gay members influence their decisions on policies and practices.  These actions have a lasting impact on how gay men and lesbians experienced the church. This study included the impacts when two major denominations voted on human sexuality policies and practices.  Not all participants were part of the UMC or ELCA during their votes, but most were aware of them.  The UMC voted to uphold marriage between a man and a woman, forbid the ordination of openly gay ministers and included policies that suspends ministers who perform same gender weddings and penalizes churches for providing funds to LGBTQ+ organizations.  The ELCA voted to allow churches to perform same gender weddings and to allow the ordination of gay and lesbian ministers.  At the time of this study, further discernment is going on with the UMC to allow a split that could mean more accepting policies for UMC churches in the United States.   It should also be noted that in 2009, the ELCA voted to engage in full communion with the UMC.  When the UMC voted against the LGBTQ+ community, the ELCA sent letters to its denomination and to the UMC standing by their full communion agreement.  While the message was one of compassion for what the UMC was facing, it was a difficult message for the LGBTQ+ ELCA members and allies to read and raised questions about the ELCAs commitment to the community.  Two of the participants partook in the discussions in an ELCA church that led to their vote. Although the vote landed in favor of the human sexuality statement and demonstrated an overwhelming support for acceptance for their church, both participants left their church because of the harmful messages they received during the forums.  Participating in the discernment  218 process caused long term damage to Katie and Jerry’s relationships to the church and many of their members.   Belonging  Participants in this study demonstrated how important it was to them to belong to a group or community.  Many of them attended church from an early age.  They went to great lengths to cling to their community membership in the church.  Most hid their sexuality for many years, including dating and marrying the opposite sex.  Two believed the church could change their sexuality.   This study highlighted what happened to members when they lost their sense of community with the church.  Several of participants were devastated by the loss and were still seeking a sense of belonging to the church in other ways.  Those who attended or looked for a Rainbow church felt like that church excluded them from a normalized church experience which was not always what they were seeking.   Joe needed volleyball to repair the hurt and pain the loss of the church caused him.  When volleyball gave him back his confidence, he was able to quickly transition into drag performance, something he would not have been able to do when he first left the church. Likewise, Jerry immediately replaced the church with his career and found a community connection with his work.  Most of the members provided at least one example of how they replaced or supplemented their church community with somewhere else they belonged.  Katie was one participant that appeared to still be struggling to find a place of community.   Emily belongs to a church where she is considerably younger than any other member, but she left a church where she was not allowed to seek ordination.  Because she feels embraced by this church, it doesn’t bother her that she doesn’t have a lot in common with its members due to  219 the age differences.  Although she feels slightly out of place because of her age, she beamed when she talked about how they have made her feel at home.   The stories of these 13 gay men and lesbians indicate that there is a lot of work to be done before gay men and lesbians can feel embraced by the church and able to be their authentic selves when they walk into worship.  The stories contributed to research on oppression of the LGBTQ+ community but further research is needed on how the church currently contributes to that oppression.  In addition, an extensive amount of research is needed to help churches drive change and address the damage the church has caused to LGBTQ+ members.  In the next section I discuss the recommendations for further research and include a call to action for churches and the allies within.   Implications and Recommendations  This study used stories to humanize a topic that is often seen as just a conflict between the church and sexuality.  Using stories reminds us that when we are making decisions that influence policies and practices, those changes hurt people.  Unless churches understand who they are hurting and how it’s resolutions impact people its members know and love, the members will continue to make uninformed decisions.  Unfortunately, churches are not equipped with how to handle the challenges presented when embracing the LGBTQ+ community.  I am including in my recommendations a call to action for the church, its leaders and the LGBTQ+ community allies with the hope for inclusion and a reach that extends beyond the church walls.  I provide recommendations for change within the church, and I provide a proposal for how to get started and how to find resources to support change. Figure 7 includes a list of what churches could do to help demonstrate support for the LGBTQ+ community and help members feel included.  The  220 figure also demonstrates a roadmap for allies to be a voice within the church and for how to engage in driving change within the church.   Figure 7 Recommendation Roadmap    Recommendations for Churches  I personally witnessed the turmoil that my church experienced when it addressed the policies and practices it held regarding LGBTQ+ inclusion.  I experienced the fall out and lost friends in the aftermath.  Change is difficult and often painful, but it is necessary.  Churches are often faced with worries over losing their funding if they address the hard stuff, this cannot be the guiding principle, God’s love for all His creations needs to be the foundational message of the church.

I was standing in my backyard when a former pastor told me how he had been pushing his church to start having conversations regarding sexuality and he shared how hard his church had pushed back on that, to the point of extreme contention between them.  This just reiterated to me the importance of taking the learnings from this study and escalating them to drive change.  That change is needed now.   The church does not need to call a vote to begin the conversations.  The church needs to provide the tools to its members to begin a loving and inclusive relationship with its LGBTQ+ members.  I vividly recall watching the transformation of one of the members of my church when the conversations around the vote began.  This member was adamant that God’s message stated that marriage could only occur between a man and a woman.  Yet this member wanted to learn more.  She remained open during the conversations.  The church did not have the tools or resources to help guide this conversation, but she persisted in her research and began sharing what she was learning in the forums.  Her shift caused a shift in others.  I recall knowing at the time that I needed to learn more but I didn’t know where to begin.  Our church library had nothing to offer, and our website hosted only a few pictures, the calendar and a link to newsletters.   When researching the UMC sexuality study documents, I came across a page on the UMCs website: UM books to inform the LGBTQ conversation.  Based on what I knew about UMCs policies, I expected to find a list of books that supported the anti-gay message, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a variety of offerings including a book written by “The first openly  222 lesbian bishop in the United Methodist Church.” (United Methodist Communications Staff, 2021, p.1).   It is important to ensure the resource list provided has been reviewed by multiple sources and provides a variety of information relevant and supportive of contributing to a positive and respectful conversation.  Similar resources should be provided in support of any marginalized groups, including addressing racism and immigration. I am including the link to the UMC site here as an example of where to start: https://www.umc.org/en/content/um-books-to-inform-the-lgbtq-conversation  When churches provide a list of resources for guiding the conversation, it sends a message to its LGBTQ+ members that they are open to the conversation, and it equips and empowers its members to be a part of the conversation from the beginning.  I recommend church’s take this one step further and host educational forums using the resources to create an open and safe space to chat.  That said, these conversations will be difficult. Leaders should be trained to understand that everyone will be entering the session from a different place.  Respect, patience and compassion will be required to navigate the conversations and to keep everyone engaged and feeling safe and loved for who and where they are in this spiritual journey.   The ELCAs Human Sexuality Study as a Place to Start    The ELCA’s human sexuality statement can provide some insights into how the ELCA used Jesus’s message as their guiding principles for their work on the statement.  That said, the statement has its challenges.  When I first read the statement, I was happy to see the recommendations for allowing the ordination of ministers in long-term, same gender, monogamous relationships and to allow same gender weddings to be performed and recognized in the church.  This is progress towards inclusion.    223 Alternatively, I was bothered by the language that seems to accept that many members will never agree with these changes.  Although I recognize the message of love and support for members who disagree, the message can also be perceived as granting permission to continue exclusion and discriminatory practices if one’s church or parishioners aren’t ready to accept the statement.  This was affirmed when the bishop informed us that we can adopt the statement without calling a gay or lesbian minister and he included that our church could still refuse to hold same gender weddings.  The human sexuality statement is a solid resource for starting the conversations and it was adopted nationally by the ELCA but a deeper look at its flaws and challenges is warranted when research is conducted.  Denominations should take on studies of their own but can use the guiding principles of Jesus’s message of love for everyone above all else as their foundation.  Listen to Each Other’s Stories     When I met with George, he wasn’t ready to give up on the fight for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the church, but his experiences gave him little hope.  We later met over coffee to talk about working together to hold forums for LGBTQ+ members to meet with conservative pastors so they can share their stories and hopefully open the ears and hearts of the ministers to more inclusive practices.  It was George’s hope that by listening to the LGBTQ+ community, the pastors would be able to get to know them, see them as parishioners who are as deserving of the same love that is provided to the heterosexual community, without the “sinner stamp” often provided to them by ministers and other church members.   It is easier to fight for a cause than it is to fight against someone you have gotten to know.  When ministers see the LGBTQ+ members as someone they know they may start to see the person instead of the situation.  In turn it is essential to understand that often minsters are basing  224 their beliefs on many years of historical theological teachings that they have been called to uphold and receive.  It can be very difficult for ministers and leaders to overcome beliefs that have deep roots.  Vanessa’s minister was transparent when he said he had work to do before he could accept her and her wife as a married couple.  He welcomed them into his church with open arms from the beginning, but it took some time before he changed his beliefs.  Nick’s director spent years battling students who tried to come out to him before he left his Missouri Synod Lutheran Church for the more inclusive practices of the ELCA.   Ministers need to open their minds and hearts to get to know their LGBTQ+ members. Allies can help be the liaison so that LGBTQ+ members don’t have to face further pain in the process.  A facilitator trained in navigating these conversations is required.    Reach out and Resolve   Members of the LGBTQ+ community have been hurt by the church in many ways over the years.  Countless LGBTQ+ members hide their sexuality, making it difficult for others to see the damage and pain that has been inflicted on the LGBTQ+ community.   The ELCA church voted in favor of the human sexuality statement, but churches still lost LGBTQ+ members in the process.  One ELCA church in my study lost its only two out members and at the time of the study, over twelve years later, has closeted, but still no open LGBTQ+ members in attendance.  When Jerry walked away from his church, members noticed because he had been vocal, and his frustration was made visible during the forums.  Katie slipped away to another church and members didn’t know her reason for leaving because she wasn’t out.  During the interview, I sensed that Katie would love to return to her home church but would never feel safe doing so.    225 Members often question if the “ALL” in “all are welcome” really includes them.  The church needs to offer ways to ensure that it sends a clear message that when it says “All are welcome” the LGBTQ+ community knows they mean to include them too.   Leadership committees such as mission and ministry, or welcome and witness should take the time to create programs to help the church with outreach to the LGBTQ+ community. Programs created for member retention and diversity and inclusion would help ensure members always felt welcome and loved regardless of their sexuality.  Churches could thrive in the diverse offerings of its congregants and should remember that these offers appeal to more than just the LGBTQ+ members.  Allies and members open to learning, want more of this too.  Recommendations for Allies  In 2006, I attended LifeLight with my youth group and thousands of other attendees.   A minister stood up in front of the crowd and prayed for those who sinned on the weekends then showed up to church on Sunday.  He immediately followed up with praying for the churches who were opening their doors to LGBTQ+ inclusion.  In a state of shock and panic, I took my youth group back to our tents to have a “damage control” conversation.  I feared that any gay or lesbian students in attendance would be devastated by the message they just heard.  I wanted them to hear directly that they were loved by God and created in his image.  The allies in the tent also spoke up.    When we returned from the event, I crafted a letter to the speaker, and I shared it with my youth.  I did not share the reply, it would have caused permanent damage to a relationship with the church that was already on shaky ground.  This event was held annually and often the highlight of the year for my youth.  After the 2006 event, we permanently scratched LifeLight from our schedule.  I didn’t know enough to be an ally yet.  This happened before our church  226 became involved in the human sexuality statement for the ELCA. I felt a calling to advocate for my gay and lesbian youth members, but it was a lonely mission for many years.  Be a Voice for the LGBTQ+ Community    Allies should be the loudest voice in the room.  I don’t mean they should shout; I mean they should be the voice that the LGBTQ+ members hear when they walk out of a forum.  LGBTQ+ members often sit in silence, afraid that by speaking up, they will out themselves.  When they hear from the church that they are not welcome or loved or that the church sees them as sinners, they often don’t want the church to know that they are part of the LGBTQ+ community.  Participants demonstrated that they went to great lengths to hide and even try to change who they were so as not to contribute to the members perception of the LGBTQ+ community.  LGBTQ+ members should be able to recognize an ally and see them as a safe person they can trust so that they can give their voice to the allies to speak on their behalf.    Get Educated on What LGBTQ+ Members Face in the Church   Allies are often the only source that can show love and support for the LGBTQ+ community.  Allies need to be educated and informed so they can represent the community when the LGBTQ+ members are unable to speak for themselves.  Allies need to understand what the LGBTQ+ members are experiencing or feeling.  In addition to what is in this study, allies need to learn and arm themselves with tools to counter the arguments that are presented by anti-LGBTQ+ church members.  They understand the obstacles that the LGBTQ+ members are facing, demonstrate counter actions and use what they have learned to help educate other church members.  There are church members on the fence, ones who have been taught that being gay is a sin, but who want to make room for their LGBTQ+ friends and family members in the church.   227 Allies can be the ones to show patience for those members and help guide them while at the same time shieling the LGBTQ+ members from feeling more pain caused by the church.  Participate in Educational Forums   Allies need to be in the room where the action is occurring.  They should lead or be a part of forums, engage in discussion, attend educational sessions and even become trained in leading Bible studies for the LGBTQ+ community.  They should help pastors understand that dividing songs or lectionaries into male versus female voices, shuts down the voice of the non-binary member and is an outdated practice.  They should advocate for change even when change is hard.   Allies should share ideas for improving the LGBTQ+ member experience by offering suggestions for programing and sharing what they have learned along the way as an ally.  When a Bible study on marriage is offered, an ally should ensure that the message includes a safe space for same gender couples to attend and participate.   When I established the Pride Network in my workplace, I quickly learned that the LGBTQ+ community was hesitant to attend initial sessions because they feared they would be outing themselves by walking into the room. Recruiting allies to make the room a safe place for the LGBTQ+ community was critical to the success of the network.  The same should happen in churches. Allies should be visible everywhere so the LGBTQ+ member feels safe.  It is important that allies do not steal the show and that they take the time to listen and learn from their fellow LGBTQ+ members.  I know I have stumbled along the way but apologizing and being open to learn has made a significant difference in my relationships with the LGBTQ+ community.  Forgiveness goes a long way on both sides, especially in church.   228 Establish Alliances   Allies should consider setting up a LGBTQ+/Straight alliance in their church.  Alliances help provide a safe space for LGBTQ+ members and allies to meet, hear from each other and understand what can be done to ensure that LGBT+ members feel welcomed, loved and accepted as members of the church.  The alliance can be used the help guide the planning for forums and events that can help shape the diversity and inclusion message of hope and love coming from the church.   The above includes a short list of actions churches can take in equipping its leaders in building a strong foundation that is inclusive of the LGBTQ+ and other marginalized groups.     This study is just a small piece of the research needed to further vet this topic.  The next section includes recommendations for expanding the research to further vet this topic.   Recommendations for Further Research  My study focused specifically on the experiences of gay men and lesbians in the Christian church which opened the doors to further research which incorporates expanding the scope to the entire LGBTQ+ population, interviewing pastors, priests and ministers who are forced to address sexuality in their church and may experience conflict with their personal beliefs, and expanding the research of the different denominations and religions, and including the Rainbow church.  Figure 8 demonstrates how the LGBTQ+ population, the pastoral perspective, and the denominational lens funnels into advanced research on the overall experiences of all LGBTQ+ members in the church.        229 Figure 8 Recommendations for Topics for Further Research   Bisexual Transgender Queer (BTQ)+   My study is just the beginning of the research required to understand what it is like to be a LGBTQ+ Christian.  My interviews were limited to gay men and lesbians, and although I was provided a glimpse into the transgender experience via Katie’s story, there is much to learn about the Bi-Sexual, Transgender and Queer+ experience in church.  My study briefly uncovered that some churches have different policies and practices for the transgender members than it does for gay men and lesbians.  Although the UMC specifically embraces their transgender member, transgender people are part of the LGBTQ+ community and see the harm the church causes the entire community rather than feeling welcomed in the church.  It will be important to understand why the policies differ, how that impacts the church’s LGBTQ+ members, and what should be done to reconcile those differences.  Pastors    The participants in my study were limited to gay men and lesbians.  Although I spoke LGBTQ+ Experiences in ChurchExamine Denominations/ Rainbow ChurchStudy Pastoral perspectives on Sexuality in the Church Interview the BTQ+ Population 230 with several pastors when I was working on the study, they were not included in this research.  Jerry’s story detailed how three different pastors struggled in three very different ways as his congregation fought for or against the Social Statement on Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust (SSHS, 2009).  The early senior pastor struggled to let go of his theological convictions and told one of his congregants who happens to be a gay man that he could not accept his lifestyle.  The associate pastor vehemently disagreed and spoke of this in private but gave no indication throughout any of the forums that she supported the statement or our churches LGBTQ+ members.  When the senior pastor moved churches during this year+ process, a new senior pastor was called.  The new senior pastor was vocal and strong in support of the community but faced many difficulties from the church and other community members.  Church and community members attacked him from multiple positions by calling him names and claiming he was not a Christian for his support of the LGBTQ+ community.    Understanding the full picture of what ministers deal with when their church or denomination calls for a vote on human sexuality would advance the research.  Ministers can provide a perspective on how churches face adversity when it comes to the LGBTQ+ conversation and what they can do to advance the quest for inclusion.   Denominations   Denominational differences were highlighted throughout my study.  Participants shared their stories from a variety of denominational backgrounds.  This led me to want to understand further how denominations determine their policies and practices, how they seek to better understand the experiences of their parishioners and how they face the conversations that are inevitable regarding LGBTQ+ inclusion.     231  The ELCA has adopted their sexuality statement, the UMC voted to uphold their policies that restrict ordination and have penalties in place for ministers who conduct same gender wedding ceremonies.  The UCC allows each church to determine their welcoming and witness practices.  There is still much to learn about other denominations and their current practices, whether they are beginning to hold conversations regarding LGBTQ+ inclusion and how they use their Biblical teachings to discern God’s gift of love and grace towards all his creation.  Understanding the churches that have made a shift towards love and acceptance and how those changes have influenced the LGBTQ+ members and witnesses watching from outside the church, will be vital to further research.   Respectively including large conservative denominations such as Southern Baptist and Roman Catholic will also provide a lens into roadblocks that are still in place for LGBTQ+ full inclusion in the church and its ministries.    A future study of the successes or failures stemming from the ELCA or UMC votes will be key to advancing the cause.  Rainbow churches are not necessarily denominational but are fully embracing of the LGBTQ+ community.   I heard throughout my study that some members had experienced a warm welcome and a love that they were previously missing when they attended a Rainbow church.  Emily saw a rainbow flag hanging in front of a UMC church and walked in the doors and joined shortly thereafter.  Meghan described her experience with a Rainbow church as extraordinary.  Nick felt like the rainbow church may be too gay and therefore it would provide a reverse exclusionary experience.  This is not what he sought in being a member of the Christian church.  Understanding the differences in how gay celebratory or embracing churches provide a loving space for its LGBTQ+ members versus how the experience might enhance or detract from the message of full inclusion in the church could warrant its own study.   232  There are several branches to follow when it comes to further vetting the experiences of the LGBTQ+ community and the Christian church, and where Christian ministry is headed.  This could also lead to further research on the LGBTQ+ experience in other religions such as Judaism or Muslim.  In addition to the plethora of research opportunities that are warranted based on this study, this study demonstrates that there is a strong case for driving change within the church.    Although the study provided valuable insights and analytics into the experiences of gay men and lesbians in their churches, several limitations were present.  I presented these in the next section.  Limitations My study included the stories of 7 gay men and 6 lesbians who were or had previously been a part of a Christian Church.  Each participant was raised and spent most of their youth and at least some of their adult years as Christian church members.  I sought to understand the impacts the church’s policies and practices regarding human sexuality had on the participants in the church.  This study is limited due to participant selection and number of participants.  I included 13 participants and I focused on identifying gay men or lesbians.  I chose this group because church policies are limited in their direction on addressing sexuality within the church for other members of the LGBTQ+ community.  For example, the UMC has specific policies regarding same gender weddings but also has policies in support of its transgender members.  There is room for additional research by expanding the participant parameters to include other members of the LGBTQ+ community.   The timing of my study also has limitations.  The United Methodist Church vote came through during the research phase of my study.  Most of my participants were not part of that discernment process so they did not provide insight into what it was like to be a member of the  233 UMC when they called the vote.  One participant belonged to a UMC church, but his church had been ignoring the rules for many years and would continue to embrace inclusion.  Other large denominations either had already adopted inclusive policies or have yet to address changes in policy regarding sexuality.  There is a cultural shift towards acceptance happening worldwide which could force other churches to face sexuality sooner than they have anticipated.  Since the vote in 2019, several groups within the UMC have called for a split, the conference vote on the proposed split(s) have been postponed to 2022.  In the meantime, the UMC continues to struggle with the call to be inclusive for all LGBTQ+ members.   Geography also provided its limitations.  Although two of my participants had experienced some form of resistance from churches in the “Bible Belt” or southern part of the United States, I did not have a strong representation of Southern Baptist members.  Southern Baptist is another larger denomination with a reputation for its anti-gay practices.  I came across details of the Southern Baptist message during my literature review.  Taking a deeper look into the Southern Baptist Church’s stance on LGBTQ+ membership and participation would provide deeper insight into extremely conservative church policies and practices regarding sexuality.  I took extra measures to ensure a balance of gay men and lesbians, but I did not do the same in trying to expand the ethnicity of my participants.  The research could benefit from expanding the diversity including ethnicity of the participants.  Participants who are marginalized because of their race could face additional marginalization because of their sexuality in the church and it could be beneficial to understand the intersectionality between race and sexuality when encountering church members and if that creates additional implications.  My study focused on the gay or lesbian church member and did not include interviews with other church members, leaders or ministers.  When my church went through its vote on the  234 ELCA Human Sexuality statement, I witnessed the pain my pastor experienced when his congregation fought against his support of the statement.  Recently, a former pastor at a local church confessed to me that one of the reasons he left his church was because his congregation refused to address the elephant in the room which was the topic of human sexuality.  Hearing the stories of the hurdles that pastors face when their congregation is discerning human sexuality would provide vital further research into this topic. Concluding thoughts It is my hope that by raising awareness of plights of LGBTQ+ Christians, that members will take time to get to know their LGBTQ+ congregants and hear their stories.  I challenge church members, ministers, leaders and allies to responsively take action to improve the church experience for all its members.  Participants in my study shared meaningful lessons that they continue to carry with them because of their experiences within the church. The participants demonstrated that they enhance the Christian movement by being allowed to participate in and lead in worship and volunteer at church community events.  The participants shared stories of being activists and volunteers for charity and church activities. They proved that they have a lot to offer the Christian community.   Finally, it is important to note that I am not a gay or lesbian member of the church.  I am a proud ally.  Being an ally comes with limitations.  I can only share what I learned from the participants.  I have not experienced the pain and heartache that they have gone through as gay and lesbian members of the church.  I am limited to my interpretation of their stories.  I am passionate about this topic and at times it was difficult for me to hold back my emotions as the participants shared their stories.   I sat through each of the forums when my ELCA church voted to accept the Human Sexuality statement.  I took an active role in leading my youth to help  235 recruit members to vote in favor of staying with the ELCA.  I guided them as they drafted a letter and created a video to share with the congregation because they could not vote.   I was at a Minnesota Vikings game when the results of the vote came through, I stood up and cheered as if my team had won the Superbowl when I received the text.  I was prepared to walk away from my church of 39 years had the vote gone any other way.  That said, my work in support of ensuring all gay men and lesbians feel welcomed and embraced as members of a Christian church did not stop there and it does not stop with this study.    I hope this study sparks an interest in not just conducting further research but in taking action to improve the relationship between the church and the LGBTQ+ community.   I am grateful to my participants for their open candor in sharing their stories.   I recognize that as a Christian who is not part of the LGBTQ+ community, it may have been difficult for them to trust me, I am thankful that they did.  It is my sincere wish that these stories bring meaning to others who struggle with their place in the church.  I pray for a church where church leaders, allies and ministers take these stories and the additional research that may come from this study and use its findings to drive change.  I pray for work to continue towards the quest for diversity and inclusion, love and compassion for the LGBTQ+ and other marginalized groups the way the Jesus intended.            236 REFERENCES Abomination [Def. 2].

You were selected as a possible participant because you or someone you know identified you as someone who would be willing to share your story of being Gay or Lesbian and your encounters with a Christian church.  You are eligible to participate in this study because are 22 years of age or older, you identify as being Gay or Lesbian and have had an experience as a member of a Christian Church. The following information is provided in order to help you make an informed decision whether or not you would like to participate.

This study is being conducted by Kari Elling, for the Department of Educational Leadership with the University of St. Thomas. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of St. Thomas.  Background Information The purpose of this study is  to understand what happens to people when their sexuality is addressed within three different types of Christian churches.  I will investigate the stories of personal experiences when Gay and Lesbian people attend a Christian Church.  My mission will be to better understand how the policies and practices of Christian Churches influence Gay and Lesbian membership.   It is my hope that with my research, I can contribute to the literature on human sexuality and the Christian Church and maybe drive change with those churches who pose limitations on Gay and Lesbian membership and participation.   Procedures If you agree to participate in this study, I will ask you to do the following things:   • Participate in interviews where you will share your stories of the encounters you have had with Christian Churches and how those encounters have either shaped your faith journey or how they  255 impacted your relationships within the church and outside with your LGBTQ+ community.   lasting at least 2 hours with potential follow-up interviews approximately 1 hour each (1-3)[Consent forms must state specifically what the subjects will be doing.  • The initial interview will be schedule for 2 hours and follow-up interviews may occur of 1-2 hour each. The interview process will likely take 2-6 hours of your time.  We will meet at a location that we will both agree will be safe and will ensure no one can hear our conversations.  If location is a factor or if you prefer we may meet over Zoom or Skype.  I plan to interview 6-12 participants.  To ensure the integrity of the study, I will audio record each session as well as take notes on a Remarkable Tablet that will only be seen my myself.  All follow-up interviews will be conducted within a month of the initial interview.  Risks and Benefits of Being in the Study The study has risks:   There are a few risks that you should be aware of in participating in this study.  I will be probing for information about your sexuality and your relationships with the church, with a partner and with the LGBTQ+ community.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThis qualitative narrative inquiry investigated the experiences of gay men and lesbians in a Christian church.  Thirteen participants shared stories of growing up in a Christian church, how their Christian church background influenced their sexual and spiritual journeys and what happened when the church challenged their sexuality.  They described what occurred when their sexuality came in conflict with the church.  Participants reflected on their relationships and how they had to continuously come out to people in their friendship circles, their family members, and their churches.  The study revealed how participants hide their sexuality to remain comfortable and accepted in the church. Participants told stories about how the church treated its gay men and lesbian members when they addressed policies and practices regarding sexuality.  Participants described their missions to take on leadership roles in the church, and obstacles they faced because of their sexuality.  The gay men and lesbians of the study encountered threats and suffered emotionally when churches tried to exclude them from leadership roles, wedding ceremonies, and worship activities.  Theoretical analysis was conducted using Tajfel and Turner’s (1979) social identity theory, Banaji’s unconscious bias theory (2013) and Steele and Aronson’s stereotype threat theory (2009).  This study demonstrated hardships that gay men and lesbians face in the Christian church but also includes a message of hope when churches fully embrace their LGBTQ+ members.  This study includes recommendations for further research and a call to action for churches, church leaders, members, and allies.\nKeywords: church, LGBTQ+, gay, lesbian, sexuality, spirituality, ally, Human Sexuality Statement (SSHS), social identity, unconscious bias, stereotype threa",
