LGBTQ use of the internet is a growing area of study. However most \nstudies focus mainly on the US and the UK, and none pays much (if any) \nattention to the experience of LGBTQ people in countries where it is illegal to be \nLGBTQ. The events of the Arab Spring, significantly, signal the possibility that \nchange may be possible in these countries, yet there seems to be little material on \nwhat LGBTQ people in these countries are actually thinking, doing, etc, and in \nparticular what role the internet may be playing in this. This is a research-in-\nprogress paper introducing a project which sets out to make a contribution on \nthese lines, by making their voices heard. \n1. Introduction: Homosexuality and the Law \nIn Western countries in contemporary culture, there are a host of different webspaces \nwhere LGBTQ people are able to meet, socialise, hook up, and share information and \nexperiences. LGBTQ use of the internet is a growing area of study, too, with three \nrecent books on the subject, (O'Riordan & Phillips, 2007; Pullen & Cooper, 2010; \nMowlabocus, 2010) and numerous journal articles and book chapters (Light, 2008; \nKreps, 2012). However, these writings focus mainly on the US and the UK, and none \npays much (if any) attention to the experience of LGBTQ people in countries where it is \nillegal to be/do anything but heterosexual. At the United Nations, in March 2011, 85 of \nthe United Nations’ 192 member countries sponsored a new version of the declaration \nfirst proposed in 2008, recognizing LGBTQ rights (Jordans, 2011), and followed it up \nwith a report published in December 2011 documenting violations of the rights of \nLGBTQ people around the world, including hate crime, criminalization of \nhomosexuality, and discrimination. Nonetheless, in many countries in the early 21st \ncentury – including those who in 2008 made a joint statement opposing the proposed \ndeclaration - the legal status of LGBTQ people is still extremely challenging. With the \nnotable exception of Israel, Turkey, Jordan, (the new) Iraq and the West Bank (in the \nPalestinian Occupied Territories,) same-sex activity is illegal throughout the Middle \nEast and North Africa. In most countries in this region there is no recognition of same-\nsex relationships or same-sex marriage; there is no legal route to same-sex adoption; \ngays are not allowed to serve openly in military; there are no anti-discrimination laws \n IN/VISIBILITY OF LGBTQ PEOPLE IN THE ARAB SPRING 213 \ncovering sexual orientation, or laws concerning gender identity/expression. In the \nSudan, Somalia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, homosexuality is punishable by the \ndeath penalty (Bruce-Jones & Itaborahy, 2011). LGBTQ people are to all intents and \npurposes invisible in public spaces in these countries. The internet, however, and in \nparticular webspaces specifically geared toward Arab LGBTQ people, do exist, where \nthey may be visible to each other, if not to the wider population. These webspaces, \nhowever, are few, mostly amateur in design and implementation compared to slick \nWestern equivalents, and rarely based in the countries themselves. Global sites lack the \nregional specificity and reinforce Western ‘typing’.  \n The events of the Arab Spring, however, signal the possibility that change may be \npossible in some of these countries. What LGBTQ people in these countries are actually \nthinking, doing, etc, and in particular what role the internet may be playing in this, \nseems thus far, however, little commented upon. This research-in-progress paper \nconsists in preliminary notes and positions on a project which sets out to make a \ncontribution on these lines. Of all the countries in the Middle East, these issues are the \nmost complex in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and this research project, in \nseeking to bring these issues to a wider audience, begins by, in the first instance, \nseeking to make the voices of Palestinian LGBTQ individuals heard. As the authors of \nthe 2011 ILGA Report enthuse, “the so-called Arab Spring gives reason to hope for \nsignificant changes in the legislation of many countries in the Middle East and North \nAfrica in a not too distant future” (Bruce-Jones & Itaborahy, 2011). \n The paper begins with a background to the legal situation of LGBTQ people in the \nMiddle East and North Africa in general, and Foucault’s history of how sexual \nidentities were characterised in Victorian Britain and its colonies. This includes a \nsection on the legal position of LGBTQ in Muslim countries in the present day, and a \nshort section on Foucault’s own experience of the Iranian Islamic Revolution. The \nresearch project in Palestine is then outlined, briefly, before considering the notion in \nWestern Philosophy of the ‘Other,’ in relation to these issues, and a potential way \nforward through use of the understanding of the Other offered by French philosopher, \nLevinas. The final section reviews use of the internet by the LGBTQ people in the \nregion and the relative invisibility of these LGBTQ issues in Western media – apart \nfrom when it suits their other, less palatable agendas.  \n2. Background \n2.1. BRITISH CHRISTIAN AND VICTORIAN COLONIAL LEGACY \nMore than half of the countries where homosexuality is still illegal “have these laws \nbecause they once were British colonies.” (Gupta, 2008, 5). “Colonial legislators and \njurists introduced such laws, with no debates or ‘cultural consultations,’ to support \ncolonial control,” Gupta tells us in his excellent recent report for Human Rights Watch. \n“They believed laws could inculcate European morality into resistant masses. They \nbrought in the legislation, in fact, because they thought ‘native’ cultures did not punish \n‘perverse’ sex enough.” This was, indeed, not so much a ‘Western’ as a peculiarly \nVictorian export. As Foucault begins in his celebrated History of Sexuality, “At the \n214 D. KREPS \n \nbeginning of the seventeenth century a certain frankness was still common… Sexual \npractices had little need of secrecy; words were said without undue reticence, and \nthings were done without too much concealment; one had a tolerant familiarity with the \nillicit. Codes regulating the coarse, the obscene, and the indecent were quite lax \ncompared to those of the nineteenth century.” (Foucault, 1990a, 3) \n Later, Victorian values of prudery gradually changed the British Christian laws \nagainst sodomy (first introduced by Henry VIII in 1533, and a capital offence until \n1861) into laws against a type of person – the homosexual. The term ‘homosexual’ was \nfirst coined by Hungarian sexologist Kertbeny (1869). This notion was taken up by \nWestphal in a famous article in 1870 as, “contrary sexual sensations” - regarded by \nFoucault as the “date of birth” of the categorisation, ‘homosexual’ (Foucault, 1990a). \nAn 1895 translation of Richard von Kraft-Ebing’s sexologists’ bible Psychopathia \nSexualis (1886) saw the word’s first appearance in English (Halperin, 1990). \n While this change was underway, however, as early as 1860 in India, laws against \nsodomy were simultaneously exported to the colonies. Clearly, “the colonized needed \ncompulsory re-education in sexual mores.” (Gupta, 2008, 5). Foucault’s main argument, \nthat the ‘repression’ of sexuality in the late 19th century, and its restriction to the \n‘parents’ bedroom’, represented, in fact, not a suppression but a veritable explosion of \ndiscourse around the subject, created, he argues, through their very prohibition, sexual \n‘identities’ which we now take for granted in the West, and for many of which political \ncampaigns have now been fought, and won, granting legal rights and protections. These \n‘identities’ moreover, with their brand new sexological terminology, conglomerated \nsexual acts which, albeit often frowned upon, had been enjoyed by all and sundry from \ntime immemorial, into human ‘types,’ whereby committing particular acts became \ndefining of who one is in a way not seen before in history (Foucault, 1990a).  \n Despite the contemporary experience of gay, lesbian and other non-heterosexual \nidentities, in the West, this characterisation of such identities rings all the truer when \nthe ‘sexualities’ of individuals in non-Western, non-modern, countries comes into \nfocus. Today, in Western countries, the Victorian ‘types’ are taken for granted, and \nteenagers discovering their ‘preferences’ are quickly socialised in one direction or \nanother towards self-identifying according to the established schema. Debate around \nwhether consumerism has played a particularly constructive part in this story – at least \nin the late 20th century (Sinfield, 1988; Green, 2002) - continues amongst academics \ndevoted to this field. On the web, indeed, where Western LGBTQ people often meet, it \nseems likely that the ‘commodification of difference’ (Light et al., 2008) contributes to \nestablishing such ‘types,’ in line with market segmentation practice, and that such \npractices reinforce and continue to spread, globally, the ‘identities’ created by Victorian \nvalues (Kreps, 2012). Nonetheless, it remains true that in non-Western countries, very \ndifferent social and cultural settlements around the concept of sexuality continue to \nmake themselves apparent – for example in South America (Fernandez, 1997; Peinado \net al., 2007) and in the Arab world. \n So in the 21st century we see “sodomy laws throughout Asia and sub-Saharan \nAfrica have consistently been colonial impositions,” (Gupta, 2008, 10) and do not \nreflect pre-colonial cultural mores. Such laws are, as Gupta titles his treatise, an ‘Alien \nLegacy’. “No ‘native’ ever participated in their making. Colonizers saw indigenous \ncultures as sexually corrupt. A bent toward homosexuality supposedly formed part of \n IN/VISIBILITY OF LGBTQ PEOPLE IN THE ARAB SPRING 215 \ntheir corruption. Where pre-colonial peoples had been permissive, sodomy laws would \ncure them—and defend their new, white masters against moral contagion.” (Gupta, \n2008, 10). \n2.2. HOMOSEXUALITY IN MUSLIM COUNTRIES \nBoth major modern patriarchal religions (Christianity and Islam) share a focus upon \nprocreation as the only legitimate reason to have sex. Yet until relatively recent times a \npragmatic permissiveness seems to have held sway, in law, and perhaps, despite \nchanges in the law, in fact in practice still persists. Not only the legacy of British \nEmpire, but also the recent more fundamentalist interpretations of Islam have been \nresponsible for a hardening of official and social attitudes against non-conforming \nsexual behaviour in Muslim countries. This is a little discussed topic. As Whittaker, \nformer Middle East editor of the Guardian, describes in his ground-breaking 2006 \nbook, Unspeakable Love: Gay & Lesbian Life in the Middle East, updated and \nexpanded in 2011, and including much “face-to-face research… in Egypt and \nLebanon,” this is “a subject that Arabs, even reform-minded Arabs, were generally \nreluctant to discuss. If mentioned at all, it was treated as a subject for ribald laughter or \n(more often) as a foul, unnatural, repulsive, un-Islamic, Western perversion.” \n(Whittaker, 2011, 11).  \n For some insight into the hardening, during the 20th century, of official attitudes, \nwe need only to look to the implementation, in Muslim countries, of Sharia Law. \nAlthough Sharia law is supposed to be God’s law, there are wide variations in what it is \nsupposed to entail. While only a few countries have state-level Sharia law, many others \nmix it with other systems, some at state, some at regional level. Turning, briefly, to sub-\nSaharan Africa, and an excellent report on the impact of the introduction of Sharia Law \nfor Muslims in Nigeria in 1960 in various northern states, we discover, “In Islam, \nsexual intercourse is lawful only if it takes place between a man and a woman who are \nmarried validly according to law” (Ostien & Umaru, 2007, 44) – again, Foucault’s \n‘parent’s bedroom’. There are a number of clauses in these laws against what are \ntermed ‘unnatural’ sexual practices. Unlike in the West, there is no generally accepted \nequivalent of the word ‘gay’ in Arabic, and there is no direct mention of such sexuality \n– certainly in Nigeria’s Sharia laws. According to Whittaker, “the term al-mithliyya al-\njinsiyya, literally ‘sexual same-ness’ has become used recently by serious newspapers \nand academic articles”, (Whittaker, 2011, 16) Popular media, however, continue to use \nthe pejorative term, shaadh (‘queer’, ‘pervert’, ‘deviant’).  \n As the authors of the report on Nigeria point out, however, “It would be \ninteresting to know whether anyone has ever been prosecuted under these sections of \nthe Penal Code, and if so, for what ‘unnatural and indecent offences’ in particular. \nThere are in fact communities of gays and lesbians in the larger Northern cities, those in \nKano being the most famous. Whether, before Sharia implementation, they ever got in \ntrouble with the law, is unknown to us. As we shall see below, even after Sharia \nimplementation they apparently continue to thrive.” (Ostien & Umaru, 2007, 50) \nImportantly, however, although since 1960, “in the Sharia States the punishments at \nleast for homosexual sex acts have gone up: rajm [stoning to death] for sodomy in most \nplaces; rajm for lesbianism in Kano and Katsina, the saving grace, again, is the \n216 D. KREPS \n \nimpossible standard of proof (barring confession). Judging from the recent news, the \nnew laws do not seem to have suppressed the gays and lesbians: \n \nNigeria transvestite handed fine. A Nigerian Islamic court has sentenced a man \nto six months in prison and fined him $38 for living as a woman for seven \nyears in the northern city of Kano. The judge told 19-year-old Abubakar \nHamza, who used his female identity to sell aphrodisiacs, to desist from \n“immoral behaviour”. Mr. Hamza, who appeared in court dressed in a pink \nkaftan and matching cap, said he was now “a reformed man”.” (Ostien & \nUmaru, 2007, 54). \n \n Whittaker, too, in his study of Arab countries, finds this curious mismatch \nbetween official attitudes and real life. “Evidence of previous tolerance can be found in \nArabic literary works, in the accounts of early travellers and the examples of Europeans \nwho settled in Arab countries to escape sexual persecution at home. Despite the more \nhostile moral climate today, however, same-sex activity continues largely undeterred.” \n(Whittaker, 2011, 11). It seems that, “as with many other things that are forbidden in \nArab society, appearances are what count; so long as everyone can pretend that it \ndoesn’t happen, there is no need to do anything to stop it.” (Whittaker, 2011, 11). \n Obviously this is hardly a happy state of affairs for those who must live a life of \nsecrecy, fearing exposure and blackmail, and face unwanted marriages, no redress in \nlaw against discrimination, and no support from health services for their particular \nneeds. Most Arabs who engage in same-sex activities, indeed, in Whittaker’s \nexperience, do not identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. As with Western societies \nprior to the Victorian sexologists, (Foucault, 1990a; 1990b; 1992) Arab societies are \nmore concerned with sexual acts than orientations. Arguably, the Western experience in \nthe last 150yrs of creating sexual identities and politicising the personal has created a \nspace in which same-sex activity can take a place in the wider society that is \nrecognised, protected in law from religious and ‘moral’ discrimination, and proud to \nspeak its name. In the Arab world, where sexuality remains more fluid, in similar \nfashion to the Medieval West, only one ‘orientation’ – the ‘moral’ ideal of patriarchal \nmale and his submissive female counterpart – is recognised, and the law seeks to \nprohibit sexual acts which fall outside of this ideal. \n The vast majority of global websites for the LGBTQ community, however, play \nquite a prescriptive role in defining the Self. When creating an online profile on one of \nthese sexual social networking sites, along with providing information about one’s \nphysical appearance, demographic characteristics, personality traits, etc, one must tick a \nbox declaring one’s sexual identity, and choose from among a specific (and arguably \nlimiting) set of sexual preferences. Such data, moreover, beyond free text boxes for \nself-description, is often collected in a multiple-choice format, and then used as criteria \nto enable the website to offer matchmaking services, linking profiles with similar \nchoices through a variety of search mechanisms. The requirements of the matching \ncriteria asked for by Gaydar, for example, are arguably constitutive of specific – and \nWestern - sexual identities. As Light et al. (2008) point out, “Not surprisingly we find \ndominant cultural stereotypes reproduced and reinforced through technological \ndesign…Although the free text element implies freedom to define oneself as one \n IN/VISIBILITY OF LGBTQ PEOPLE IN THE ARAB SPRING 217 \nchooses, the presence of menus and tick boxes shapes a pre-defined notion of what may \nor may not be an acceptable expression of identity.” (Light et al., 2008, 307) Making \nsuch choices at the outset, when creating one’s profile, may in fact have the effect of \nlocking individuals into specific roles, prior to meeting, from which they are then \nunable to escape without admitting online dissimulation once face-to-face, at the risk of \nlosing the connection as soon as it is made. Importantly, though, “the greater level of \nanonymity provided by the internet, as compared to face-to-face encounters, allows \nindividuals to present aspects of their current perceptions of themselves that they would \nnot ordinarily present to other members of society.” (Yurchisin, 2005, 737). In other \nwords, the options may enable individuals to ‘role’-play at being one of the pre-defined \n‘types,’ online, despite reservations regarding such behaviour offline. Anonymity, too, \nseems likely to be of greater significance to LGBTQ individuals in Middle Eastern \ncountries. Photography and video, used extensively in the West, seem largely absent on \nthe profiles of, for example, those Arabs who have ticked the check-box ‘Single Gay \nMan,’ to create a profile on one of the most popular global gay male websites, \nGaydar.com. A cursory search for residents of Bethlehem, in the Palestinian West \nBank, on Gaydar, returns 13 profiles of which only two have photographs.  \n2.3. FOUCAULT AND THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION \nThe rise of fundamentalist Islam has had a strong impact upon the lives of North \nAfrican and Middle Eastern LGBTQ people. Looking again beyond Arabic society, to \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran – where state-level Sharia applies - there is an instructive \nstory concerning the very thinker who gave us our understanding of Western sexual \nidentities: Michel Foucault. In 1978-79, Foucault became embroiled in the real-world \nevents of the Iranian revolution. “Progressive and leftist intellectuals around the world,” \nAfary and Anderson tell us in their excellent guide to these events, “supported the \noverthrow of the shah… [but were] less enthusiastic about the notion of an Islamic \nRepublic. A major exception to this ambivalence was Michel Foucault” (Afary & \nAnderson, 2005, 2). Foucault visited Iran during this period on a number of occasions, \nhad private meetings with some of the key political and clerical players – including \nAyatollah Khomeini – and wrote a string of articles for the Italian broadsheet, Corriere \ndella sera. Foucault seemed blind to the patriarchal, authoritarian history of the extreme \ninterpretation of shi’ism that had been developing over the course of the 20th century in \nIran - a reactionary force at every turn of its modern history. They actively opposed the \nIranian Constitutional Revolution of 1906-11, which made several egalitarian moves; \nthey vehemently opposed the Ataturk-style secularisation of Reza Shah’s regime in the \n1930s – especially the banning of the veil; and they opposed every step of the gradual \nincrease in women’s political rights during the 1940s and 1950s. A major factor in the \nShi’ite opposition to the Shah’s White Revolution in 1963 was the granting of suffrage \nto women. All these gender reforms were characterised by the Shi’ite clergy as \n“nothing to do with true equality ..[but]…instead an example of Western imperialist \ninfluence” (Afary and Anderson, 2005, 74). Foucault’s gender blindness with regard to \nthe Iranian revolution included the Shi’ite attitude to homosexuality. In 1998, \nsociologist Ehsan Naraghi, who had met Foucault during one of his visits to Iran, \nrecalled a conversation he had had in an interview with the well known Iranian \n218 D. KREPS \n \njournalist Ibrahim Nabavi, twenty years previously. Afary and Anderson quote the \ninterview at length, but just the following snippet about a meeting with several devout \nMuslim revolutionaries is revealing enough: \n \n“EHSAN NARAGHI: You know that Michel Foucault was a homosexual, and \nthis issue had an important influence on his ideology and his thinking…….. \nFoucault was very curious and very sensitive about the issue [of \nhomosexuality], and suddenly he asked, “What would the position of Islam \nand this future Islamic government be toward those we call minorities?” My \nwife and the other two said, “In Islam, respect for minorities is required, and \nseveral religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Zoroastrians may exist.” \nThey did not understand the meaning of Foucault’s question, although I \nimmediately understood what he meant. Foucault said, “I mean the attitude \ntoward those whom society calls abnormal and such other things…” My wife \nrealised what he was talking about…. She got up and brought a French \ntranslation of a Quranic verse, placed it in front of Michel Foucault, and said, \n“Execution!” Foucault was dumb-founded. He was upset and left that night.\" \n(Afary and Anderson, 2005, 143) \n \n Perhaps this was one of the first moments upon which Foucault’s understanding of \nwhat was really happening in Iran began to counter what he hoped was happening. \nFinally, as the true face of the revolution began to show itself, Foucault stopped writing \narticles, and fell silent – for the rest of his life – on the topic of the Iranian revolution.  \n One need only look to the very recent case in Derby in the UK, where three \nMuslims have been imprisoned under new laws against hate crime, for promoting the \ndeath sentence for gay men, to understand that radical fundamentalist Islam – the world \nover – remains adamantly anti-homosexual (Addley, 2012). Clearly, with Gupta, this \nauthor believes “Eliminating these [anti-gay] laws is a human rights obligation. It \nmeans freeing part of the population from violence and fear.” (Gupta, 2008, 12) Yet it \nis also clear that gay and lesbian communities continue to exist in North Africa and the \nMiddle East, whether or not they self-identify or can indeed be categorised as such, and \nenjoy a level of acceptance and permissiveness in the wider communities which they \ninhabit. The research being undertaken, about which this paper constitutes some \npreliminary notes, seems so far to bear this out. \n3. Research in Progress \n3.1. PALESTINE \nThe author has contact with a British humanitarian aid-worker, who I will refer to as \n‘James’, working particularly in Bethlehem. Bethlehem is in the West Bank, where \nsame-sex activity has been legal, under the auspices of Jordanian law, since 1951, but \nwhere there is no recognition of gay or lesbian relationships, no same-sex marriage or \nadoption, no anti-discrimination laws covering sexual orientation, or laws concerning \ngender identity/expression (Bruce-Jones & Itaborahy, 2011). In the other part of the \n IN/VISIBILITY OF LGBTQ PEOPLE IN THE ARAB SPRING 219 \nOccupied Palestinian Territories, Gaza, male homosexuality remains illegal, punishable \nby up to 10 years in prison, but female homosexuality is legal. This is because in the \nGaza Strip, the British Mandate Criminal Code Ordinance, No. 74, of 1936, remains in \nforce and continues to outlaw same-sex acts between men, although lesbian women are \nnot subjects of the code and their relations are thus, technically, not unlawful (Ottosson, \n2010). Reportedly, a number of Palestinians self-identifying as gay men have been \nleaving the Occupied Palestinian Territories, seeking refuge in Israel, which has \nWestern European style anti-discrimination laws and was a signatory to the March 2011 \nproposed UN resolution, (BBC, 2003; Kagan & Ben-Dor, 2008) this, despite the fact \nthat if discovered by the Israeli authorities they are likely to be detained and deported as \na security threat. They cite in particular, however, rather than the old colonial laws, the \nfear of Islamic retribution at home (BBC, 2003; Kagan & Ben-Dor, 2008; Whittaker, \n2011). Despite extreme difficulties with Israeli law on the subject of asylum, however, \n(Kagan & Ben-Dor, 2008) it seems Palestinian gay men may finally be close to gaining \nlegal protection in Israel Harrison, 2008) (see also below).  \n The situation seems somewhat more relaxed in the West Bank. James, the \nBethlehem based aid-worker, in email correspondence in January 2012, told me “I \nknow some gays in Bethlehem, who quietly go about their lives and hang out. In truth, \nthe majority of people don't mind and are neutral about it.” Asked if he could help with \nmy research, James volunteered to bring an online questionnaire to the attention of the \nBethlehem ‘gays’, and their responses will form the core material of the next paper in \nthis research programme. As James says in his emails, “There was more openness in the \n1960s-70s, when Arab socialism liberalised social mores, and women were more \n'liberated' too, but the Islamist wave of the 1980s on, tightened things.” Interestingly, on \nthe subject of permissiveness despite the legal situation, James affirms that “People \nhave quietly-held personal views that are more liberal, while publicly cleaving to more \nconservative views - because of their transitional doubts and inner reviewing of Islamic \nmoral codes.”  \n The two year research project aims to uncover a picture of how LGBTQ \nindividuals in Arab and Middle Eastern countries make use of the internet and new-\nmedia in their lives, and what their hopes and fears of the ongoing Arab Spring may be. \nAs the issue at stake is in/visibility, the methodology adopted will be interpretive, and \ngrounded theory will be used in as reflexive a way as possible (Urquhart & Fernandez, \n2006). Grounded theory is deemed appropriate for this project as it is, firstly, “useful \nwhere no previous theory” exists, second, and most importantly, “it incorporate[s] the \ncomplexities of …. context into the understanding of the phenomena. Third, [grounded \ntheory methodology is] … uniquely fitted to studying process and change.” (Urquhart \n& Fernandez, 2006, 457). All information acquired through the research will be \ncollated into the popular research software tool, nVivo, and coded ‘on the fly’ as it is \ncollated.  \n In the first instance, a pilot project is underway to create an online questionnaire \nand to invite LGBTQ individuals in Palestine, known to the British Aid worker, \n‘James’, to complete it. The first individuals to complete the questionnaire should do so \nin October 2012. The pilot is being undertaken in Palestine firstly because this is where \nthe primary initial contact to undertake research has been made, but secondly because \nPalestine presents the most complex set of circumstances the project is likely to \n220 D. KREPS \n \nencounter in the Middle East and North Africa, combining the legacy of the British \ncolonial era, religious intolerance, and an oppressive state machinery that, in the case of \nPalestine, is not merely funded and supported by the West, (as with many of the \ndictators threatened by the Arab Spring elsewhere in the region) but constitutes an \noccupying populace drawn from around the world. Whilst this confers upon Palestine a \nunique combination of circumstances, as a pilot for the wider research it allows the \nproject the opportunity to encounter and develop appropriate responses to all the \ncircumstances it is likely to encounter in one go. Much may be learnt in Palestine that is \nnot generalisable to the wider region, yet also many issues in the wider region may in \nturn reflect what the situation in Palestine epitomises. \n As the introduction to the questionnaire states, “I want to hear from you about \nyour life, the things that are important to you, what it is like to live as an LGBTQ \nperson in your country, and what your own experiences are of this. In particular I am \ninterested in what part the internet may be playing in your life, and in your experience \nof the recent turbulence in the region.” The intention is to collate the responses to this \ninitial questionnaire and derive a series of questions for a handful of one-to-one \ninterviews, to be conducted over Skype. The hope is to thus approach a picture of how \nLGBTQ individuals in Palestine describe their own situation, what use of the internet \nand new media they are engaged in, and their hopes for the future. Following this initial \npilot, it is hoped that a new online questionnaire can be created and opened up to the \nwider Middle East and North Africa. Eventually, during 2014, it is intended to create a \nwebsite with the anonymised voices of LGBTQ people, in both English and Arabic, and \nto thereby make these voices heard. \n3.2. GAY PALESTINIANS AND THE OTHER \nThese issues raise particular questions about the notion of the Other in Western \nPhilosophy. The Other as a concept that is defining of the Self has quite a pedigree in \nWestern thought, going back to Hegelian ideas of alienation and resolution, and \nHusserl’s notion of intersubjectivity. But it is the notion of the Other in post-colonial \nstudies, in gender studies, and in the ideas of Emmanuel Levinas, that are of most \ninterest in this context. In post-colonial studies, to use the term introduced by of one the \nfounders of the field, the Palestinian academic, Edward Said, the unequal relationship \nbetween conqueror and conquered requires an ‘othering’ of the subordinate culture by \nthe dominant empire, which facilitates exploitation, suppression, and the ill-treatment of \npeoples regarded as less human than the dominant power (Said, 2003). Palestinians, \ntherefore, are arguably historic victims of two successive ‘otherings’ in the 20th century \n– first by the British Empire, and then by the Israeli state. This colonial relationship of \ncourse works both ways, in that, as Whittaker points out, “Cultural protectionism is one \nway of opposing Western policies…. and so exaggerated images of a licentious West, \ncharacterised in the popular imagination by female nudity and male homosexuality, are \ncountered by invoking a supposedly traditional Arab morality.” (Whittaker, 2011, 12) \n In gender studies, the relationship between men and women is treated (e.g by de \nBeauvoir 1973) as a Self/Other dynamic, and the ‘othering’ of women by men a source \nof patriarchal dominance. Similarly, in the work of Judith Butler and others (Butler, \n1990; 1993) one can find an understanding of homophobia described as the ‘othering’ \n IN/VISIBILITY OF LGBTQ PEOPLE IN THE ARAB SPRING 221 \nof homosexuality, revealing insecurity about their own masculinity in those for whom \nhomophobia is experienced strongly. Anti-gay sentiment, in this reading, is not merely \nabout people communicating their beliefs about the ‘class’ of gay people, but a means \nby which homophobes can distance themselves from this class and its social status. The \ncreation of the ‘types,’ in Foucault’s reading of Victorian sexology, is a classic case of \ngender ‘othering,’ whereby a heterosexual normality was created in opposition to – and \ndomination over – a homosexual abnormality, simultaneously shutting off more fluid \nsexual behaviour for those for whom the acts associated with either ‘typology’ may \nhave been an occasional indulgence alongside those which were otherwise a preference. \n These issues of post-colonial and gender othering are brought starkly into focus by \nthe phenomenon of Palestinian men-who-have-sex-with-men fleeing from the West \nBank and Gaza into Israel, seeking asylum. Whittaker quotes reports suggesting up to \n600 such cases exist (Whittaker, 2011, 41.) Victims of a double Othering, their flight \nfrom religious-inspired othering in the Occupied Territories is then confronted by the \nimperial othering of the Israeli authorities for whom their nationality means they are a \nterrorist threat and must be detained and deported back to the Occupied Territories. A \nvery recent report on ten such cases going through the Israeli courts is extremely \nrevealing of this double tension. As the authors report, “Their cases presented a series \nof unusual legal and practical problems. Although Israel has a nascent asylum system, \nPalestinians are excluded by virtue of their nationality from applying for asylum” \n(Kagan & Ben-Dor, 2008). Undertaking interviews with these individuals whilst they \nwere in custody in Israel, the authors relate how “the interviewees reported that, from \nan early age, they knew that homosexuality would not be tolerated by their society” \n(Kagan & Ben-Dor, 2008, 9). “A, a young man in his twenties who was interviewed in \n2003, told us: ‘Gays have been persecuted in Gaza as far back as I can remember. Until \n1993, militias of men with masked faces regularly attacked known gay men’” (Kagan & \nBen-Dor, 2008, 9). Another interviewee told a harrowing story of the ill-treatment of \ngay men in the West Bank: “C, who grew up in a village in the West Bank, reported an \nincident in his village: ‘When I was a teenager, I had sexual relations with other young \nmen from the village. One of them, a young man called M., wasn’t discreet enough and \nwas suspected of being a gay by the villagers. Graffiti was sprayed against him in the \nvillage, and at one point he was caught by a local gang. They captured him, set him on \nfire, and told him it was a punishment for his sins, and a warning to others. He suffered \nsevere burns, especially to his face’” (Kagan & Ben-Dor, 2008, 9).  \n The complexity of the double-othering for gay Palestinian men is highlighted by \nthe testimony of another of these interviewees: “D, a twenty year old from the West \nBank said: ‘In Palestinian culture, being homosexual is not only a great offense on the \npart of the homosexual, but is also a disgrace to his entire family and an abomination \nagainst Islam. It is also viewed as an act against the Palestinian struggle for \nindependence. Known homosexuals are presumed to be weak and to identify and \ncollaborate with Israeli Jews’” (Kagan & Ben-Dor, 2008, 10). Whittaker, too, reports \nthis suspicion of betrayal: “‘In the West Bank and Gaza, it is common knowledge that if \nyou are homosexual you are necessarily a collaborator with Israel,’ said Shaul Gonen, \nof the Israeli Society for the Protection of Personal Rights. Bassin Eid, of the \nPalestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, explained: ‘In the Arab mindset, a person \nwho has committed a moral offence is often assumed to be guilty of others, and it \n222 D. KREPS \n \nradiates out to the family and community. As homosexuality is seen as a crime against \nnature, it is not hard to link it to collaboration – a crime against nation” (Whittaker, \n2011, 41). The legal recognition and protections for LGBTQ people in Israel, “while \nbolstering Israel’s image as a liberal-democratic society, in the Arab countries… also \nadd grist to the idea that homosexuality is a ‘foreign’ phenomenon” (Whittaker, 2011, \n42). This bolstering of Israel’s image in the eyes of the West has come to be known as \n‘pinkwashing.’ \n There seems, nonetheless, to be some hope on the horizon. Shortly after the \npublication of Kagan and Ben-Dor’s report, Reuters reported that one gay Palestinian \nman had gained the right to asylum in Israel, perhaps most significantly in order to live \nwith his Israeli lover. (Harrison, 2008) The case spent a good while going through the \ncourts, however. “The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said on its website the \nPalestinian man had been asking for permission to live with his Israeli lover, a \ncomputer engineer in his 40s, for five years. They have been together for 8 years, the \npaper said.” (Harrison, 2008) It is hoped that the findings of the research currently \nunderway by the author of this paper will add weight to the statement included in this \nreport by “one rights group working with Palestinian gays… [that] there had been few \nreports of physical violence in recent years.” Gay men in Bethlehem, perhaps, may \nenjoy a more traditional, permissive, inclusive tolerance than the forthright othering \nevidenced above. What seems apparent, at least in translation, from these legal cases, \nhowever, is that men-who-have-sex-with-men who flee the Palestinian Occupied \nTerritories seeking asylum in Israel, self-identify as ‘gay’ men, in keeping with the \nWestern typology. \n3.3. A WAY FORWARD \nHow is such othering to be overcome, particularly in such complex circumstances as \nthose experienced by Palestinian men-who-have-sex-with-men? Certainly not in the \nshort-term, one would imagine. Yet in the medium term the work of Lithuanian-born \nJewish philosopher and Talmudic scholar, Emmanuel Levinas, (who was based in Paris \nfor much of his life, and wrote in French) might have bearing in Israel at least, toward \npromoting a more tolerant and enlightened asylum system. What influence these ideas \nmight bring to bear in Arab countries remains to be seen. Levinas’ contribution to \nWestern Philosophy in the late 20th century derived from his experience of the \nholocaust, and a profound commitment to and defence – even in the hostile atmosphere \nof 1960s French discourse analysis and its pronouncements of the ‘death of the subject’ \n– of Humanism. For Levinas, the Other becomes an ethical a priori, ‘prior to any act’, \nsuperior or prior to the Self. The mere presence of the Other, confronting us as ‘face’ \n(Levinas, 2006) demands of us before any response a fundamental recognition of the \nlimits of the Same. For Levinas, the Other is an ‘alterity’ that is beyond the ‘othered’ \nsubordinates who, by our domination of them, are actually merely the other side of the \ncoin of ourselves – those ‘others’ are actually part of what is Same, and the true \n‘alterity,’ the real Other, once recognised, is the absolutely unknowable, true source of \na humility that would prompt us to treat our ‘othered’ selves with far greater respect. \n In this reading, where a quite transcendent and spiritual appreciation of an \naltogether more complete Other places ethics before metaphysics, we can perhaps \n IN/VISIBILITY OF LGBTQ PEOPLE IN THE ARAB SPRING 223 \nglimpse an argument that might hold sway with religious minded moralists in Muslim \nsocieties: an argument that stresses that wider reform and adoption of human rights, our \nresponsibility to each other, must come before all other considerations. Whittaker’s \nmain argument is that “sexual rights are not only a basic element of human rights but \nshould have an integral part in moves towards Arab reform, too. Open discussion of \nsexuality can also bring other reform-related issues into sharper focus.” (Whittaker, \n2011, 13). The main argument of this paper, too, then, would suggest that recognition \nof the ‘othered’ as a part of ourselves, and taking responsibility for them, presents an \nargument that could be instructive not just for LGBTQ experience in Muslim countries \nbut for wider reforms in the Middle East and North Africa as a whole. \n3.4. THE INTERNET AND GAY PALESTINIANS’ IN/VISIBILITY \nWhat role the internet might play in all of this also remains to be seen, but there are \nalready signs that it is capable of having a profound effect. Those individuals self-\nidentifying as LGBTQ people in Middle Eastern and North African countries already \nhave recourse to a wide network of online forums based at GayEgypt.com. Unlike the \nglitzy, professional web design of Gaydar, GayEgypt.com and its main ‘sister’ web \naddress, Marrakesh.net, present the rather 1990s, home-made aesthetic of the hobbyist. \nThere are separate forums for each of a range of North African and Middle Eastern \ncountries – including Palestine – and a News page that is packed with photographs and \ntestimony of the events of the Arab Spring. Based in Bahrain and serving mostly the \npopulation of the Arabian Peninsula is the new social networking site, Ahwaa.org, \nwhich claims itself as the home of debate for LGBTQ issues in the region (LA Times). \nBut news specific to the ‘gay’ experience is probably best sourced from the regional \nwebzine, GayMiddleEast.com which includes thoughtful – and often rather academic – \narticles as well as up-to-the-minute news reports. Principal among the online resources \nfor self-identifying LGBTQ Palestinians, however, seems to be AlQaws.org, perhaps \nthe most professional looking of all the websites this author has seen in the region. \nTheir ‘About’ page begins with the following statement: “alQaws for Sexual & Gender \nDiversity in Palestinian Society is a group of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, \nquestioning and queer (LGBTQ) Palestinian activists who work collaboratively to break \ndown gendered and hetero-normative barriers. alQaws seeks to create an open space for \nall its members so that they may be engaged and energized in the struggle for equality \nand inclusion.” The inclusion of the ‘Q’ – questioning and queer – with the LGBT is \nperhaps of particular importance in this context, given the comments above about \nidentities, and would seem to be drawn from the growing understanding, in the West, \nthat the ‘Q’ is more common than might appear. Generally used as a label setting queer-\nidentifying people apart from the lifestyles that typify mainstream LGBT communities \nin the West, it is also a term that challenges the Victorian ideologies that created the \nLGBT identities in the first place. \n Members of this Palestinian community undertook a speaking tour of the United \nStates recently, prompting a response on Facebook from no less a luminary that Judith \nButler. In her message, she picks out some of the most salient points touched upon in \nthis paper: “As you doubtless know, many people in the LGBTQ community in the \nUnited States remain relatively ignorant about the conditions of Occupation. Your joint \n224 D. KREPS \n \npresentations made clear what the daily confrontation with Israeli military power is like, \nhow difficult mobility is, and how important it is that any queer activism commit itself \nto the struggle against the Occupation - an insupportable subjugation of the Palestinian \npeople that clearly abrogates international law and the basic precepts of equality and \njustice. Indeed, you made perfectly clear why allying with groups that are not clearly \nand actively opposed to the Occupation is impossible. At the same time, you showed us \nhow absolutely important it is to struggle for greater freedoms for sexual minorities in \nPalestine at every level of society, including the movements that are resisting the \nOccupation and calling for Boycott, Sanctions, and Divestment. In this time when Israel \nis actively engaged in \"pinkwashing\", that is, advertising its ostensible tolerance for \ngays and lesbians as a way of deflecting from the illegal and unconscionable \nsubjugation of over two million Palestinians. It is quite monstrous that they seek to use \nus - gay, lesbian, queer, trans - in order to cast themselves as the beacon of democracy \nin that region, if democracy implies the equal treatment of the inhabitants of the land, \nregardless of nationality, origin, religion, race, and ethnicity!” (Butler, 2011). \n3.5. ARAB SPRING \nAlongside the continuing struggle of the Palestinians, however, in other countries in the \nregion 2011 saw substantial and fundamental change, in response to unprecedented \npopular upheavals. Yet some of the signs for LGBTQ equality and inclusion are not, \nthus far, particularly hopeful. Despite hopes to the contrary, in Tunisia, arguably the \ncountry most advanced along the route of the Arab Spring, things are really not looking \ngood for LGBTQ legal status. Speaking to TV presenter Samir El-Wafi, described as \n‘homophobic’ by regional gay news website gaymiddleeast.com, Tunisia’s new Human \nRights Minister Samir Dilou attacked Tunisian ‘Gayday’ webzine and agreed “gays \nneed ‘medical treatment.’” (Littauer, 2012) Yet the existence of Gayday, launched in \nTunisia in March 2011, is itself a sign that Western sexual identities are increasingly \nrecognized in Arab countries and that young Arabs are seeking legal freedoms to adopt \nand live them (Gayday, 2012).  \n So far, the vast majority of what has been discussed in this paper has been largely \ninvisible in the Western media. Yet one story – of a lesbian blogger in Syria – captured \nthe Western press in June 2011, and catapulted the issue of LGBTQ equality in Arab \ncountries to the centre of the debate. It turned out to be quite a storm in a teacup, \nhowever, and very revealing of the Western media’s sensibilities. The ‘lesbian blogger \nin Syria’ turned out to be male, and American, and writing from the comfort of his desk \nin Scotland. One can come to many conclusions about what the story of ‘Amina,’ the \n‘gay girl in Damascus,’ actually means. Her posts, and the CNN article (Davies, 2011) \nabout gay rights in the Arab world which brought her blog to the world’s attention, \nseem to be concerned about the fate of LGBTQ people under would-be Arab \ndemocracies. The implication of this focus, however, seems to be that LGBTQ people \n“have fared better under Arab authoritarianism and that, given a choice, would prefer to \nbe under a regime that oppresses them politically but “allows” for a minimum of sexual \nfreedom rather than be under a [religious] government that grants them political rights \nand might be more socially conservative” (Mikdashi, 2011). As the LA Times put it, \n“While the media kerfuffle continues over the fake Syrian lesbian blogger… gays and \n IN/VISIBILITY OF LGBTQ PEOPLE IN THE ARAB SPRING 225 \nlesbians in the Middle East are struggling daily to make their voices heard” (LA Times, \n2011). The otherwise highly respected Carnegie Endowment for International Peace – \nfounded in 1910 - who created an ‘Arab Spring’ tracker website in April 2011 to \nmonitor developments across the region, unfortunately produces not a single return on a \nsearch for ‘gay’ or ‘lgbt’ (Carnegie, 2012). \n4. Conclusion \nThis research-in-progress paper, therefore, although it must await the results of the \nresearch before any firm conclusion, finds that the concerns of LGBTQ people in the \nMiddle East and North Africa are historically complex, caught as they are at the nexus \nof colonial ‘othering’ as well as religious and moral ‘othering’ by both Christian and \nIslamic hetero-normativity, and that – perhaps unsurprisingly – this ‘othering’ is at its \nmost complex and difficult in the Palestinian Occupied Territories, where the pilot for \nthe research will take place. It is also clear that these issues, aside from some academic \ninterest, remain largely invisible in Western media and political circles, beyond \n‘pinkwashing’ attempts by Israeli commentators keen to show their liberalism in \ncomparison to their neighbours, and the widespread Western insecurity in response to \nthe Arab Spring that prompts fears that LGBTQ people might fare worse under Arab \ndemocracies than they did under dictatorships.  \n Yet the anecdotal evidence thus far seems to suggest that the legal status of \nLGBTQ people in these countries – often simply a colonial legacy no-one has yet seen \nfit to remove from the statute book – and the often noisy pronouncements of religious \nbigotry, belie a tolerance within the wider community – (or at least anecdotally in \nBethlehem, and by inference from events on the web in parts of Tunisia) that is \npragmatic, historic, and – arguably – ongoing. The hope for widespread reform that \nincludes the legal rights and protections enjoyed by LGBTQ people in the West, in the \nfinal analysis, will depend, in a newly democratic context in Arab states, on that very \ntolerance.  \n The results of the research being undertaken in this project, bringing the voices of \nthose directly affected into the open, promise to be especially revealing in this respect. \nThe role played by the burgeoning number of online resources for self-identifying \nLGBTQ Arab individuals in the region, and the eventual augmentation of these with the \nproject’s own website, portraying a snapshot of (anonymised) LGBTQ voices for a \nmore global audience, promise to make this an interesting and important research \nproject. \nReferences \nAddley, E.

However most studies focus mainly on the US and the UK, and none pays much (if any) attention to the experience of LGBTQ people in countries where it is illegal to be LGBTQ.
