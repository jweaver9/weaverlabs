Drawing on three interview studies conducted in 2017and 2018 in Kazakhstan and Russia, respectively, this articleexamines and compares narratives on queer activism in bothcountries. Our findings reveal how visibility has an ambivalentmeaning for queer people in these cases. For many, public queeractivism is perceived as vulnerable and risky, thereforealternative, less ‘visible’, methods of activism are preferred anddeemed more useful. For example, participants in our studiesmentioned using social media, signing petitions and taking partin educational initiatives as alternative forms of queer activism.The article deliberates the pursuit and applicability ofrepresentational visibility politics within queer activism inKazakhstan and Russia’s fluctuating contexts.ARTICLE HISTORYReceived 10 January 2023Accepted 5 July 2023KEYWORDSQueer activism; LGBTQ+;Russia; Kazakhstan; post-Soviet context; invisibility;visibility; progressivistnarrativeIntroductionVisibility and invisibility have been highly debated within feminist and queer literature(Ayoub 2016; Edenborg 2019; Wilkinson 2020). Western andWestern-inspired movementspursue a representational visibility politics characterized by the idea that public visibility isessential to liberate and empower marginalized groups, increase awareness of injusticeand challenge negative attitudes (Ayoub 2016; Edenborg 2019). However,representational visibility politics has been criticized for its potential to expose alreadyvulnerable groups to more risks (e.g., Edenborg 2019; Stella 2015).Poststructuralist feminists theorized visibility (and invisibility) as a tool of regulation andcontestation, discussing how people are differentially affected and permitted or prohibitedfrom the public realm of appearance (Butler 2015; Taylor 1997). According to thosetheorists, the capacity to regulate what is to appear in public is the very expression ofpower and domination, determining who can speak and be heard, who can be recognizedand be intelligible, and who can and cannot be deemed as a politically qualified subject.© 2023 The Author(s).

Judith Butler believes that when people assemblein public, the mere fact of their bodies being out there and publicly visible claims the rightto appear (Butler 2015, 37). At the same time, Butler writes about the vulnerability that isassociated with resistance and visibility. Indeed, the very possibility of showing up withone’s body in public is contingent on physical and mental well-being (Hedva 2018).Hence, individual actors face the dilemma of weighing up the need to achieve one’s pol-itical goal against the risks to freedom, violence and security (Butler 2015), and even death(Majewska 2021). For queer people1 this dilemma has been described by several research-ers (Richardson 2017; Wilkinson 2017).The question of vulnerability associated with public agency and resistance is particu-larly poignant in authoritarian regimes, such as in Russia and Kazakhstan,2 where repres-sive legislation and regulations of collective action are constraining public protests(Article 19 2015; Clément 2015). In this article, we debate the relationship between (in)visi-bility and queer activism within authoritarian regimes using Kazakhstan and Russia ascomparative case studies.Debates about the visibility of queer people in the post-Soviet space have been the focusof several studies (Buyantueva 2018, 2022; Edenborg 2017, 2019; Stella 2013). For example,Francesca Stella criticizes representational visibility politics as being Eurocentric, analysing anexample of the public backlash following the Moscow Pride in 2006 (Stella 2013, 2015).Debates about queer visibility in former Soviet countries are entangled with constructionsof ‘West’ and ’East’. The division between the ‘good’ West and the ‘bad’ or ‘laggingbehind’ East incorporates the progressivist timeline and narrative (Kondakov 2021; Mizie-linska and Kulpa 2011). In accordance with it, Western countries are represented as progress-ive, developed and inclusive of queer people, while non-Western countries are backwardand homophobic. In addition, in non-Western countries, queer activism is expected tofollow the path that the queer movement developed in the United States and NorthernEurope. Indeed, Western queer activism is based on the concepts of visibility, public appear-ance and ‘coming out’ that are not always applicable in non-Western countries (Edenborg2019; Stella 2013, 2015). Such ‘iconic’ (Butler 2015) public activism is often not inclusive ofpeople of different religions, levels of ability, people of colour and immigrants.Gradskova, Kondakov, and Shevtsova (2020) highlight that in contrast to the West,where a sexual revolution occurred in a form of public expression, in post-Soviet countriesa different kind of revolution emerged. Given the vigorous censorship and regulation ofany public speech and discourses, particularly in relation to practices that deviated from‘traditional’ gender and sexuality values (Healey 2018), Gradskova, Kondakov, and Shevt-sova (2020) argue that the ‘revolution of intimacy’ took place in the alternative, privatesphere in state socialist countries, where people engaged in political action in the inti-mate spaces outside of public sight. Criticizing representational visibility politics, Grads-kova et al. argue that ‘when transformations are not seen, this does not necessarilymean that they are not happening at all’ (365).While Russian queer activism has been the subject of several studies (e.g., Buyantueva2022; Lukinmaa 2022; Soboleva and Bakhmetjev 2014) as well as substantial popularmedia attention, presently only a limited amount of scholarship focuses on queer activismin Central Asia (e.g., Levitanus 2022a; Wilkinson 2014, 2020; Sultanalieva 2023). At the sametime, LGBT activism in Central Asia also remains underrepresented within the international2 M. LEVITANUS AND P. KISLITSYNAmedia. Currently, no studies explore narratives of queer activism in Kazakhstan andRussia in acomparative framework. In this paper, we address this gap by jointly analysing three narrativeinterview studies from these two countries. By presenting a joint analysis, it looks at the cross-overs and discrepancies within narratives of queer people in Kazakhstan and Russia. More-over, analysing queer activism in a comparative framework illustrates the extent to whichRussia influences Kazakhstan’s politics and discourses around queerness (or not).This article raises the question of whether political action needs to be seen in order to‘happen’ or if alternative forms of activism that occur within informal settings, privatedomains (Gradskova, Kondakov, and Shevtsova 2020) is an option. We debate the credibilityof ‘uneventful activisms’ (Mayerchyk and Plakhotnik 2021) or activism that is ‘low-key, smallscale, and initiated by individuals or small, informal groups’ (Jacobsson and Korolczuk 2020,130), which happens in a private sphere and that has little discussion within mass media andpublic discourse. Whilst interrogating the idea of queer activism, we do not subscribe to thebinary view of visibility/invisibility. Instead, we question what (in)visibility means for our par-ticipants in relation to queer activism. We specifically look at participants’ narratives and con-ceptualizations of different forms of activism: visible, invisible and in-between.Cai Wilkinson, when discussing the evolution of LGBT politics in the former SovietUnion, argues there has been a shift in the post-Soviet space from state-enforcederasure of homosexuality and gender variance to the emergence of public forms ofqueer activism in the mid-2000s to eventually a state of ‘hypervisibility’ where opponentsof LGBT rights actively provoke moral panic in the name of defending reinvented tra-ditional family and national values (Wilkinson 2020, 3). Within this article we critique Wilk-inson’s identified trajectory and argue against the generalization of the post-Soviet regionas a homogeneous space. Instead, we argue that Kazakhstan and Russia differ significantlyin terms of their queer politics and discourses.In the following two sections we present an outline of changes in queer represen-tational visibility politics within Russia and Kazakhstan. We then discuss our methodsand reflect on our positionalities before we present the main narratives on queer activismarriving from our interviews with queer people in Kazakhstan and Russia. The article endsby considering the shared features and divergences within narratives of queer activism inKazakhstan and Russia.Contextualizing queer activism in RussiaOver the last decades, traditionalist and homophobic sentiments have grown in Russia.Against this backdrop, Russian conservative groups developed propaganda pertainingto non-traditional sexuality, which also found expression in legal norms (Healey 2018;Wilkinson 2020). In 2013, a federal law banning the spread of propaganda of non-tra-ditional sexual relationships among minors was adopted in Russia. The adoption of thislaw led to an increase in censorship and self-censorship on non-traditional sexuality(Soboleva and Bakhmetjev 2014). In 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, there was anew conservative turn and surge of homophobia: the term ‘Gayropa’ and the notion ofthe ‘deviant’ nature of the European gender order became popular in Russian discourseregarding the Ukrainian crisis (Martsenyuk 2016).By the mid-2000s queer protest activities arose because of the development of a col-lective LGBT identity and increasing pressure on queer people (Buyantueva 2022). EachCENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY 3year during the 2010s, queer public actions were held in Moscow and St Petersburg. Forexample, the 1st May marches from 2011 to 2019 in St Petersburg included a rainbowcolumn where people walked with flags and placards advocating queer rights, thoughin 2019 some participants encountered obstacles from the police that preventedLGBTQ+ symbols from being brought to the march (Gay.ru 2019).At the same time, in the 2000s and 2010s, the visibility of feminist initiatives and dis-courses increased. This included the case of Pussy Riot (Yusupova 2014), new forms offeminist activism with less formal types of organizations (Sperling and Mcintosh Sund-strom 2021), and the MeToo Movement (Muravyeva 2020). Since the mid-2000s, feministand queer online activism has been developing, and the number of public queer accountsin social networks has been growing (Andreevskikh 2018).In 2019, the Levada Centre reported that almost half of Russians (47%) stand for equalrights for gay people (Levada 2019). It was the highest level of support for equal rights forLGBTQ+ people since 2005. This was explained by a decrease in the effect of the cam-paign around the propaganda law (Levada 2019). However, in 2021, the proportion ofpeople supporting equal rights for LGBT people dropped to 33% (Levada 2021). It canbe assumed that the reason for such change was the campaign related to amendingthe Constitution of the Russian Federation in 2020. One of the amendments of therevised constitution was the enshrining of the concept of marriage as a union ofbetween a man and a woman. Thus, in Russia, the rise and fall of homophobic sentimentsis not a linear process. These social changes depend on political decisions and rhetoric,dominant discourses, as well as civil initiatives.In addition to the law on propaganda, other laws of the Russian Federation are anobstacle to queer activism and protest. The ‘foreign agents’ law adopted in 2012 compli-cates the work of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and de facto banned foreignfinancing (Bederson and Semenov 2022). Since Russian state funding is completely una-vailable for LGBTQ+ organizations and they are dependent on transnational donors, thislaw led to the necessity to hide donor names, as well as the porous boundaries betweenorganizations and informal groups (Pakhnyuk 2019).Russian legislation provides for the procedure for coordinating any public action withlocal authorities. In theory, this legislation should contribute to the ease of holding ofpublic events, but in fact authorities use it to restrict the rights of Russians to assembleand express their opinions. The authorities refuse to approve unwanted protests, andthe need to apply to hold a public rally in advance makes any spontaneous action prohib-ited (Buyantueva 2022). In 2014, an article determining criminal responsibility forrepeated violation of the established procedure for organizing or holding street actionswas adopted. Nevertheless, until 2020, protests, including LGBT actions, were sometimesallowed to take place.In 2020, due to the COVID pandemic, restrictions were imposed on holding massevents, which were often used as a tool to censor and pressure political activists. Theserestrictions are still in place, although mask requirements have been dropped and massevents supporting the authorities take place unhindered.Since the start of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, military censorshiphas been preventing protest action, including those concerning queer rights, even in theform of single pickets, which were previously possible. As in 2014, the invasion of Ukraineand the disengagement from the ‘Western’ world led to a new round of homophobia. A4 M. LEVITANUS AND P. KISLITSYNAclear example is the updated ‘gay propaganda law’ which now sanctions heavy fines for‘LGBT propaganda’ among people over the age of 18 (RBK 2022). Moreover, some LGBTactivists and even organizations were forced to leave Russia (Coming Out 2022).Contextualizing queer activism in KazakhstanExisting reports indicate that discrimination and the threat of violence remain a part of theeveryday life for queer people in Kazakhstan, making invisibility and silence the onlyviable strategies to enable them to continue to live safely. While the constitution ofKazakhstan includes a definition of ‘discrimination’, it does not mention ‘sexual orien-tation and gender identity’ as a category to be protected against discrimination (Article19 2015; Human Rights Watch 2015). These omissions allow government officials andlaw enforcement authorities to interpret this provision in various ways, often againstqueer people (Sekerbayeva 2017). Despite the lack of legislative protection and the por-trayal of queer people in Kazakhstan as silent and invisible within the existing reports, thevisibility of queer people in public and LGBTQ+ activism has increased over recent years(Wilkinson 2020).Between 2013 and 2015, following the adoption of the ‘propaganda’ law in Russia,similar legislation was attempted in Kazakhstan, thus evidencing Russia’s ‘soft power’ inthe region (Healey 2018). While the anti-LGBT ‘propaganda’ law was rejected, thereappeared to be an increase in discourse around queer citizens both on a governmentaland societal level (Human Rights Watch 2015).Kazakhstan’s dominant discourse and relationship towards the West is significantlymore lenient in comparison with that of Russia, with Kazakhstan’s national narrative of Eur-asianism and foreign policy of multi-vectorism aiming to sustain good working relationswith major international political players (Hanks 2009; Patalakh 2018). Elsewhere, weargue that Kazakhstan’s politics of Eurasianism and multi-vectorism challenged some ofRussia’s soft power in relation to queer people (Levitanus and Kislitsyna, forthcoming).As highlighted by Patalakh (2018, 37), ‘while Russia is positioning itself as a strongopponent of LGBT rights domestically and abroad, Kazakhstan behaves far more neutrally’.Existing reports point out that the invisibility of queer people is also linked to the lackof an organized queer community in Kazakhstan, resulting in limited social connectionsbetween queer people (Article 19 2015; Human Rights Watch 2015). However, the pres-ence of organizations such as Amulet, Adali, Kaleidoskop and Community, as well asthe Gay.kz website, signalled the existence of an organized queer community in theearly 2000s (Buelow 2012). Since 2015, several other organizations have made prominentappearances, such as Kazakhstan’s Feminist Initiative, Feminita – a queer-feminist collec-tive; Kok.team – LGBT website (Kok.team ended its work in March 2022 after five years);and Alma-TQ – an initiative group aiming to support transgender and gender non-con-forming people. The above organizations have strong links with transnational LGBT net-works, which have remained an important resource and support both financially andsymbolically (Sekerbayeva 2017).Despite an increase in the number of queer organizations in recent years, Sekerbayeva(2017) notes from private conversations with other representatives of NGOs in Kazakh-stan, that given the ambiguity of the government’s position towards queer citizens,engagement with queer activism is often feared out of concern of being marginalizedCENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY 5and representing anti-government political views. Furthermore, complicated and bureau-cratized legal procedures surrounding setting up an NGO prevents organizations such asFeminita from being officially registered (Sekerbayeva 2019).Another factor affecting the organization of a queer community and setting up NGOs isthe availability of funding. Given that only certain forms of activism and organizations arerecognized by foreign funders (Heap 2003), only a limited number of actors can accessfunding from foreign donors, facilitating a small group of queer activist organizationsto achieve an ‘elite’ status (Lukinmaa 2022). Part of the expectations of foreign donorsis the emphasis on transnational practices and methods of activism that emphasizehuman rights and an institutional development agenda, with little account of local spe-cificities and needs (Lukinmaa 2022; Sekerbayeva 2017; Sultanalieva 2023). As pointedout by Sekerbayeva (2017), ‘[f]eminists, activists of gender NGOs – consciously and uncon-sciously – accept tools from Western feminism and use them for the purposes of recolo-nization of personal and political spaces’ (144).Moreover, the law preventing engagement in peaceful assemblies that are not agreedupon and approved by the government prevents events such as Pride parades in Kazakh-stan (Article 19 2015). At the same time, groups that are not formally registered in Kazakh-stan are banned from organizing protests. Like in Russia, protests, assemblies and publicperformances not granted government approval are regulated.Regardless of the regulations of public assemblies, during recent years InternationalWomen’s Day marches approved by the Almaty city authorities have been jointly orga-nized by feminist and LGBT initiatives (Peshkova 2021) and have featured many queeractivists and groups. Apart from an increase in public assemblies, LGBTQ+ visibility inKazakhstan has been growing with the appearance of multiple queer-dedicated andopenly queer social media accounts (Buelow 2012; Kudaibergenova 2019).With the increase in queer visibility in Kazakhstan, there is also an increase in reinforce-ment of ‘traditional’ values in the country (Dall’Agnola 2020; Kudaibergenova 2019; Wilk-inson 2020). Dall’Agnola (2020) looked at heterosexual citizens’ attitudes towards queerculture in Kazakhstan and found that LGBTQ+ visibility is perceived negatively bypeople in their 30s and older. Dall’Agnola’s (2020, 108) 30+ respondents saw the‘origins of the phenomenon of LGBT’ as coming from outside, namely, Europe andother Western countries, and only tolerate queer people as long as non-heterosexualpractices remain confined to the private sphere (see Levitanus and Kislitsyna, forthcom-ing, for more detailed discussion of association of queerness as coming from ‘outside’).The effects of the escalation of Russia’s war against Ukraine and the full-scale militaryinvasion in February 2022 on queer lives in Kazakhstan and queer activism remains to beseen. Furthermore, given the impact of the Russian media and the internet in Kazakhstan(Laruelle, Royce, and Beyssembayev 2019), it is unclear how the escalation of homophobicrhetoric and the passing of the full ban on LGBT propaganda in Russia will impact queerlives and attitudes towards non-heterosexual and/or non-cisgender people in Kazakhstan.MethodologyThis article is based on semi-structured interviews with 11 queer people based in Almaty,Astana and Karaganda in 2017 (Levitanus 2020), and semi-structured interviews with 49non-heterosexuals based mostly in Moscow and St Petersburg in 2018. The interviews6 M. LEVITANUS AND P. KISLITSYNAin Kazakhstan were conducted by Mariya; the interviews in Russia were conducted byPolina. We also draw on Polina’s master’s research from 2017 on LGBTQ+ activism in StPetersburg using semi-structured interviews with 34 queer people. We acknowledgethat Polina’s study had significantly higher sample size than Mariya’s. However, giventhat the two studies are employing qualitative methodology, the number of participantsis less important than the depth of narrative accounts. Whilst anonymising identifiableinformation, we kept participants’ self-identifications and self-descriptions to honourand respect their preferences. Both studies did not explicitly enquire into participant’sethnic origins and identifications. However, this information was noted if participantsbrought it up in their interviews. While all participants discussed their ethnic origins inKazakhstani study, ethnicity was not mentioned by most participants in Russian studies.The Kazakhstan study used narrative interview methodology, focusing on everyday lifeexperiences. Foucauldian-informed narrative analysis (Tamboukou 2013) was employedto examine the narratives of queer people in the light of specific power structures anddiscourses around gender and sexuality in Kazakhstan. The Russian study used biographi-cal interviews that covered the lives of the participants from early childhood to the time ofthe research, with a focus on sexual biographies. Both studies used similar probes focus-ing on people’s narratives of their everyday lives.Given the co-constructed nature of narratives in the way that the audience exerts aninfluence on what and how is said, as well as the way those narratives are later interpreted(Salmon and Riessman 2013), elements of the researcher’s positionality need to beacknowledged. We both have a close connection with Kazakhstan and Russia. Mariyawas born in Kazakhstan. Polina’s parents were born in Kazakhstan, and although Polinawas born in Russia, she lived in Kazakhstan in early childhood. Polina is ethnicallyRussian, as far as she knows; Mariya is ethnically half-Russian and half-Jewish. Consideringthe above, we cannot neatly classify ourselves as either being ‘insiders’ or ‘outsiders’.Indeed, as Naples (1996, 140) points out, ‘[i]nsiderness or outsiderness are not fixed orstatic positions, rather they are ever-shifting and permeable’. Hence, the researcher hasto continuously negotiate and engage with the whole spectrum of various social identi-ties and their intersections.One of the aspects of the authors’ positionality and limitations to acknowledge is thatthe interviews for studies in Kazakhstan and Russia were conducted in Russian due to theauthor’s insufficient proficiency in the Kazakh as well as other local languages spoken inRussia and Kazakhstan.In Russia the language question is complex and cannot be addressed without Russia’shistory of expansion and incorporation of peoples with distinct languages, cultures andreligions (Khanolainen, Nesterova, and Semenova 2022). In Kazakhstan the debateabout the status of Russian language in the country also involves complex argumentsabout Kazakhstan’s Soviet past, nationalism, ideological influence and legislation (Sabi-tova and Alishariyeva 2015). In short, while Kazakh is the state language, Russian hasthe status of the official language in Kazakhstan. The Russian language is widelyspoken not only amongst the Kazakh population but also among Russian and otherethnic minorities living in Kazakhstan (Sulejmenova 2010). However, the spread of theRussian language in Kazakhstan is uneven. The Russian language dominates alongsideRussian borders whereas in other regions (Kyzylorda, Shymkent, Dzhambul and SouthernKazakhstan), Russian is only used marginally (Shaibakova 2020). The choice to conductCENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY 7interviews in Russian is an obvious limitation to our studies. Apart from potentially repro-ducing problematic power dynamics, it precludes access to participants who are not profi-cient in Russian.Another limitation is that interviews in both of our studies were conducted in majorcities and urban areas of Kazakhstan and Russia. Existing studies from both countries indi-cate that queer experiences are likely to differ significantly for non-heterosexual and non-cisgender people living outside of urban environments and metropolitan centres (Dal-l’Agnola and Thibault 2021; Stella 2012).When writing about Kazakhstan and Russia, it is essential to acknowledge Kazakhstan’scolonial past vis-à-vis the Russian Empire (Turaeva 2021) and the Soviet Union that hasrecently been re-evaluated as an imperial formation (Shchurko and Suchland 2021).Whilst postcolonial discourse has been adopted by key political players in Kazakhstan(Kudaibergenova 2016), there is still an ambiguous relationship between Kazakhstanand its former oppressors, including the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. Kudaibergen-ova (2016) argues that this is partly explained by Kazakhstan’s continuous relationshipwith Russia and its substantial Russian-speaking minority. Russia continues to hold astrong influence over Kazakhstan; one of the ways in which this influence is evident isin the impact of Russian media and the internet in Kazakhstan (Laruelle, Royce, and Beys-sembayev 2019). Russia’s power and continuous influence in the region is also evidentwithin the practices of knowledge production about queer lives and queer activismwithin Central Asian context both within academia and beyond, which remainsRussian-centred (Sultanalieva 2023).Figure 1. Kurmangazy–Pushkin poster designed by Havas Worldwide Kazakhstan. Source: ©2014Havas Worldwide Kazakhstan.8 M. LEVITANUS AND P. KISLITSYNADespite all the differences and power of Russia vis-à-vis Kazakhstan, we believe thatthose differences do not invalidate the comparison. In making a joint study of queer nar-ratives in Russia and Kazakhstan, we follow the metaphor of the Kurmangazy–Pushkinkiss, as described by Shoshanova (2021). Shoshanova discusses a poster depictingKazakh composer and folk artist Kurmangazy Sagyrbaiuly and Russian poet AlexanderPushkin kissing (Figure 1). The poster was created to advertise a gay club in Almaty in2014 and was seen as a way to respond to the ‘propaganda’ law passed in Russia ayear before. Shoshanova argues that since Kurmangazy and Pushkin are presented asequals, it disrupts the very idea of Russian superiority in relation to Kazakhstan. Similarly,within this article, by placing the two countries as equals, we disengage and challengesome of the established hierarchies of power. By writing about Russia in a comparativeframework and analysing the case and narratives from Kazakhstan, we aim to disruptthe tendency of scholars to analyse post-Soviet space as monolithic (e.g., Wilkinson2020). In the following section we present the main narratives on queer activism fromour interviews with queer people in Kazakhstan and Russia.ResultsActivism = being outAt the time of the interviews in 2017 in Kazakhstan, there were still only a handful ofpeople publicly ‘out’. One of the participants who was ‘out’ described that the merefact of being ‘out’ in Kazakhstan means that they are an activist. For example, a cisgenderhomosexual man in his mid-30s who is now publicly open spoke about the time before hecame out: ‘I just planned to live a peaceful life so that no one touches me and my partner.I did not plan to be an activist or be public [about his sexuality].’ Here, being an activistand being public is put in contrast to the ‘peaceful life’. This participant later explainedthat for him being open about his sexuality already meant that he was engaging inactivism and therefore was changing society. This participant continued to tell ananecdote from his life:We were once walking down the street and saw two guys walking and holding hands. Myfriends shouted, ‘they lost all shame, look at them!’ as a joke. Of course, this is what we actu-ally want. We want normalisation. And just like that, step by step, thanks to guys like that,there is change […] I can tell that I am completely open. And all this activism and beingopen is first for me, not for anyone else.From this quotation it is evident that visibility was admired and strived for by some of ourparticipants in Kazakhstan. The phrase ‘this is what we actually want’ indicates a directionand destination that this participant envisions for the queer community in Kazakhstan. Itshould be normal for queer people to be open in public. Similarly, a gay man from StPetersburg in his mid-20s spoke about being/coming ‘out’ as being a form of activismin itself:Another one of the things you can do is be open. It hurts, it’s scary, but it’s very important. Myfriend’s father thinks that gays are aliens. If they exist, then somewhere far away, not here.And he has a gay son but he doesn’t know. And he [friend] says […] as soon as hebecomes autonomous from his parents, he will definitely tell them, because he understandsCENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY 9the importance and necessity. However, people in the regions can’t say this because there arerumours and bullying [… ].The participant supposes that being open about one’s sexuality could demystify somepeople’s assumption that gays do not exist and therefore address the problems of homo-phobia. Yet, he fears that it might be dangerous for queer people to come out publicly,especially in regions outside of Moscow and St Petersburg. Some participants from ourstudies reproduced the representational visibility discourse (Edenborg 2019) that‘[g]etting out of the closet and into the streets’ (Lukinmaa 2022, 320) is a necessaryway forward. They equated the idea of activism with being ‘out’ and being open aboutone’s queer identity in public.Most people want a quiet lifeNot everyone within the participants’ narratives was striving towards visibility. Partici-pants in our studies highlighted the division within the community: those who pursuevisibility and those who want ‘a quiet life’. As the cisgender homosexual man in hismid-30s from Astana points out:Most people in the LGBT community here […] say, ‘Okay guys, if you want to do your activism,that’s fine, just don’t touch us.’ I mean, they are comfortable, they meet guys in clubs, ondating apps, and they don’t have to talk about it. They don’t need to assert themselvesand fight for their rights. That’s okay; it is just a part of the community.From this quotation, it appears that many in the community fear visibility. They do notmind activism as long as it does not directly concern their lives. This narrative echoesSekerbayeva’s (2017) observation that people fear to engage in activism in Kazakhstan,because their activism might be interpreted as an anti-government political stance andassociated with risk.Another participant from St Petersburg in his early 30s who identifies as a gay manhighlights that visibility comes with the risk of harming one’s professional career and per-sonal life. He both promotes visibility and empathizes with those who ‘lead a closed life’.Indeed, being an activist, particularly in Russia, comes with many risks that are now furtherexacerbated by an increase in repressive legislation in 2022 (Buyantueva 2018, 2022).Below another participant speaks to their ambivalence towards activism:Someone thinks that LGBT activists are doing stupid things or nonsense. In part, of course,they are right because activism really attracts attention. […] On the other hand, the histori-cal process is irreversible. We live in a single field with Europe, and activists who want tospeak out will still appear. […] In that sense, making things worse is an inevitable process.[…] We need to try to minimise the negative and maximise the positive. But […] have noother way.Elsewhere in the interview this participant attributed partial responsibility for the repres-sive legislation and homophobic sentiments in Russia to queer activists’ activity. However,they also recreate progressivist narrative (Kondakov 2021; Mizielinska and Kulpa 2011)highlighting that queer people in Russia are moving towards Europe, and that queer visi-bility and public appearance is imminent.Gulzada,3 a lesbian in her mid-40s who was interviewed in Almaty, also spoke aboutthe division in the community:10 M. LEVITANUS AND P. KISLITSYNAWe have split from other girls because they think that we are attracting danger. It’s like we arewaving a red flag, that we are here and that our community is here. They probably think, whydo that? We are living here; we are earning good money, going to restaurants, going abroad.[…] They are questioning why we should cause problems. While we are thinking that if wedon’t come together, the community won’t develop and grow. I personally think that it’simportant to speak up and be visible.Gulzada described a segment of the Almaty lesbian community who did not supportqueer activism. From Gulzada’s quotation, it is clear that activists are often seen as‘causing problems’, attracting attention or waving the flag. This is consistent with existingresearch based in Russia and Kyrgyzstan, that highlight that many queer people do notexpress support for activists and their actions (Mamedov and Bagdasarova 2021; Sobolevaand Bakhmetjev 2015) often out of fear of exposure and homophobic violence, harass-ment and humiliation.Tema: those who want to stay invisibleAs pointed out by Mamedov and Bagdasarova (2021), the Russian word ‘tema’ or ‘v teme’is one of the most common ways to symbolize one’s non-heterosexual and non-cisgenderidentity. Mamedov and Bagdasarova conducted an ethnographic study with focus groupsin Kyrgyzstan between 2017 and 2019. They write that often ‘“LGBT” identity is opposedto “tema” that is seen as an “old” form of identification’ (3). The purpose of tema is not toincrease public representation and defending civil rights, but to ‘remain unidentified bymainstream society in order to avoid negative consequences’ (Wilkinson and Kirey2010, 486). Yet, according to Mamedov and Bagdasarova (2021), tema is not just an oldform of representation but an identification that is evolving and changing, encompassinga complex form of lingo-cultural symbolization.Most of our participants were well familiar with tema, irrespective of their age. Tema or‘temasynba’was used by both Russian and Kazakh speakers in Kazakhstan. For example, asGulzada explains: ‘Yes, tema is also used in Kazakh. Once on Vkontakte [social media] I wasasked something about “temasynba”. I didn’t even understand at the beginning and thenrealised that she meant tema.’While some participants in this study referred to temamorebroadly as a form of queer identification, other activists differentiated those who wanted a‘quiet life’ as the ones identifying with tema. To remain in the closet and therefore in thetema, some queer people even marry and have kids, as the following quotation by cisgen-der homosexual man interviewed in Astana shows.There are apps where men who have sex with men meet, and they ask: ‘Are you in thetema?’ [ty v teme?]. […] I think that a lot of gay and bisexual men are suffering from inter-nalised homophobia. […] They basically occasionally meet other guys in secret for sexwhile being married to a woman. I have a couple of very good friends. They’ve knowneach other for fourteen years, and they live together. To everyone else they are brothers.They use this term ‘tema’, they can’t say the word ‘gay’, and they make up otherterminology.Here, the participant referred to those who identify themselves with tema as people whohave internalized homophobia and who cannot or do not want to be open about theirqueer identity. Similarly, a cisgender gay man in his early 20s argued that tema onlydescribes the act of two non-heterosexuals having sex with each other:CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY 11Tema is hypersexualised, it does not even mean sexual orientation, it’s more related to theterm ‘sodomy’. It’s not a way of life. […] It’s just one singular act of sex. Hence people ask:‘how long have you been in the tema?’ They mean when did you first have gay sex? Moreover,you can come in and come out of tema. And those who leave tema are heroes. They are ableto overcome the temptation. It’s like they talk about cigarettes, ‘I want to give up, but I can’t’.The participant linked tema to sodomy, comparing it to a temptation or addiction to giveup. Participants in the Russian study also referred to tema, differentiating it from a morepoliticized identity of LGBT. Bisexual woman in her late 40s interviewed in St Petersburgexplains:If the tema is like: ‘Hurrah! There are people like me. I can go to a club, pick someone up andhave a beer.’ LGBT is more like a human rights organisation. LGBT people are people in allcountries, not only here, minorities who have come together to defend their rights. It ismore of a political and human rights activity, and not a good party where you can meet inter-esting people.Similarly, to Mamedov and Bagdasarova’s (2021) findings, our study indicates that tema isoften viewed more broadly and contrasted to a more politicized identity of LGBT. Giventhat the interviews were conducted in relatively big cities, it is plausible to assume thatthe narratives around the use of ‘tema’ would have been different if we had goneoutside of the main metropolitan centres of the two countries and interviewed non-activists.Queer activism ≠ political activismSome participants separated political activism from queer activism. For them, politicalactivism (e.g., protests against unfair elections or corruption) was identified to be moreimportant and useful, while queer activism was rated insignificant, useless or evenharmful. In some cases, respondents’ negative attitudes towards queer activism werecause by their personal attitudes towards those activists who organized street actions,as in the quotation from a lesbian woman in her mid-40s from Moscow:Well, of course, I always went to all these Bolotnye, all these Fields of Mars.4 I never went toLGBT [ protests] because […] I mean in the last few years. And I have already said how I feelabout activists. I don’t even want to be around them. To political [protests], yes, of course.While this participant went to the major political protests in Moscow and St Peters-burg in 2011–12 (Gel’man 2015), she criticized queer activists and protests. This par-ticipant expressed a strong personal dislike of specific individuals who are publiclyengaged in queer activism in Russia. A younger participant from Moscow who ident-ifies as gay man in his 20s echoed her dislikes of queer activism when speaking abouthis friend’s action to send pro-LGBT petitions to government officials. There aredifferent kinds of activism, some being political and others being more practical.According to this participant, the participating in any political action is somethinginherently problematic:And there is such LGBT activism, when people brought, I don’t remember exactly, letters tothe prosecutor’s office. They were detained. […] This is also cool, but this is about the [pol-itical] struggle. […] Well, it is a different, rather global story about politics. It’s a pretty muddyswamp.12 M. LEVITANUS AND P. KISLITSYNAThe above contradictory quotation indicates both appreciation and apprehension aboutqueer activism. While the participant admired those who sent petitions, he was also wearyof the political consequences of the activism. His use of ‘muddy swamp’ describes queeractivists’ political struggle as something dirty and unsafe that is different from other more‘useful’ forms of activism. In contrast to participants in Russian study, participants fromKazakhstan did not differentiate queer and political activism. Indeed, apart fromGulzada, who spoke about Zhanaozen,5 most participants did not mention Kazakhstan’spolitical sphere within their interviews.Activism does not have to be iconicSome participants separated visibility-oriented LGBT activism from queer activism thatseeks to address ‘real’ community issues. For them, any public statements or streetactions are not as fruitful as ‘quiet’, invisible activism that solves specific problems. Forexample, a pansexual man in his mid-40s from Almaty does not consider visibility-oriented activism as necessarily the most useful:Many understand activism as going on stage and saying loudly ‘I am gay’. For me, activism issomething different. Let’s say there is a problem that needs solving and for that we need togather as a group. Because if you just go on TV and say alone – ‘Here I am, and I am good andyou are all bad’ – the problem will not be solved. In Kazakhstan, many problems need to beresolved first on a documentation or bureaucratic level, and not through some public per-formance. […] Indeed, this performance is not activism. It is just a public ‘coming out’. Ofcourse, it can become activism if you inspire some people to start following you. Itbecomes activism if you move from ‘I’ to ‘We’.In contrast to our previously discussed narrative of equating activism to ‘coming out’, forthis participant queer activism should be less directed towards increasing queer visibilityand more about structural changes in the country. He also highlights that queer activismshould be a more collective-oriented activity than individualistic endeavour. Other partici-pants in our studies spoke about more or less ‘useful’ forms of activism. For example, a gayman in his late 20s from Moscow mention several examples of ‘useful’ and worthy queeractivism:LGBT activism can really vary. There is LGBT activism, when the story with Chechnya beganand quite a lot of people were engaged. […] There were people who pulled poor boys outof there, found them housing, and collected money to relocate them somewhere. This isvery cool. There is a guy […] and his activism is that he argues with people. He finds somekind of dispute about LGBT on Twitter, and he comes to the comments and calmly,without swearing, with facts and evidence, tells people why they are wrong. In myopinion, this is a super hard job. […] If he’s talked to a thousand people and ten peoplechange their minds, that’s pretty cool.This participant mentioned the example of an LGBT Network which helped LGBT Chechensescape violence (Scicchitano 2019). Using social media accounts to speak out against nega-tive stereotypes about LGBTQ+ people was deemed to be another form of ‘useful’ queeractivism by this participant. In writing about social networking sites as platforms forqueer activism, Andreevskikh (2018, 14) points out that particularly in the light of repressivelegislation and censorship ‘any attempt at promoting LGBTQ issues online and portrayingLGBTQ individuals in digital media can be seen as LGBTQ-right activism’.CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY 13For several participants in our studies, online queer activism was seen as a safer optionthan offline activism. Apart from online activism, participants found other forms of acti-vism that suited them. For example, a gay man from Moscow in his mid-30s points outthat he was ready to engage in activism in the form of signing petitions on Change.organd similar platforms. Others spoke about educational activities, such as giving lecturesand writing articles about LGBTQ+ issues on activist websites. Community events and dis-cussions were also identified as an alternative form of activism.Another participant, a lesbian in her early 30s from St Petersburg, points out that she doesnot understandhowstreet actionswork andhow they can support her and the LGBTQ+ com-munity more generally. She is engaged in sex education, writes articles about female andlesbian sexuality, and maintains a blog. Choosing to make educational activities, she doesnot consider political meetings valuable. This attitude can be related to a lack of positiveexamples when mass protests influenced political decisions. Besides, participating in streetactions is unsafe; and thedanger towhich theprotesters expose themselvesmaynot be com-mensuratewith thepotential benefits of theevent. Sheanswered if shewent to street actions:No. […] At this moment, I do not have enough input data, including motivation. […] For me, itis not an inspiring thing. And I don’t see support for the community in it because I don’t seesupport for myself in it. I don’t see much of an effect in it. Again, I don’t see how it works. Andthat’s why I don’t get involved.These quotations expand the narrow view of ‘political’ that sees political action only interms of actions and activities that are openly declared as such, which often meansmissing out on the political life of subordinate groups (Scott 1990). Participants in ourstudies spoke about different kinds of activism, which they often classified as ‘political’and implicitly ‘apolitical’, as well as ‘worthy’ or ‘useful’ and ‘pointless’ or ‘questionable’.As pointed out by Jacobsson and Korolczuk (2020, 131):[i]t is therefore necessary to extend our understanding of political engagement to include awide range of activities oriented towards change by which people attempt to collectively chal-lenge the status quo – even if for various reasons those engaged reject the label of ‘political’activism.Being Kazakh, being Russian and being a queer activistParticipants from Kazakhstan found it especially important to integrate their ethnic andqueer activist identities. Sex, sexuality and queer identity in Kazakhstan is often associatedwith the culture of shame or Uyat and deemed taboo (Levitanus 2022b). Resources weredevoted to writing and translating LGBTQ+ resources into the Kazakh language andincreasing queer visibility in Kazakhstan. For example, often Kazakh national clotheswere used by queer activists (e.g., Feminita activists wore chapan or shapan6 to a rallyon 8 March 2022 in Almaty). A young cisgender gay man from Astana speaks aboutthe importance of increasing the visibility of Kazakh queer people.7In the future I want to be publicly open and be a public activist. I think it is simple Kazakh-speaking. […] If a simple Kazakh guy says, ‘I am gay and I will fight for other gay people’,it will have an effect.This participant emphasizes the importance of the public visibility of Kazakh queer peoplespeaking Kazakh. The participant highlights that such activism in Kazakhstan is likely to14 M. LEVITANUS AND P. KISLITSYNAhave more of an effect. They elaborated that writing in Kazakh and creating more visibilityfor Kazakh queer people is crucial for reaching people who do not have access toresources in languages other than Kazakh, as well as people coming from outside ofthe metropolitan centres. Another interesting division is highlighted between ‘public’and ‘non-public’ activism here. At the time of the interview, this participant was involvedwith an alternative form of activism where he wrote articles in the Kazakh language anon-ymously on an activist website (Levitanus 2022a).As pointed out within the methodology section, most participants in studies related toRussian LGBTQ+ did not talk about their ethnic origins. When speaking about beingRussian, participants in Polina’s study referred to Russian national identity, which was per-ceived as being incompatible with being queer and open simultaneously. As described byLukinmaa (2022, 320), ‘the common perception of LGBTQ+ activism is as ‘a rootless tree’that is external, even alien, to Russian society at large’. Some participants talk about theinevitable unhappiness and closedness of queer people in Russia. A lesbian woman fromMoscow in her mid-20s speaks about what it means for her to be a Russian lesbian: ‘Beinga Russian [russkoĭ] lesbian means manoeuvring between one’s nature and the surround-ing people.’ Her Russian lesbian identity is having to be constantly negotiated. The par-ticipant mentions the need to sometimes hide her queer ‘nature’ which is embeddedwithin the intersection of being Russian and her sexuality. Another participant – a gayman in his mid-30s from Karelia, spoke about his complex relationship with Russia: ‘Allof Russia became a place “without love” where I got hurt all the time. I was thrownand humiliated, and not only in personal relationships.’ For this participant, love and hap-piness is not available to queer people who live and stay in Russia. He describes the deeppain associated with his past experiences while living there. Against the backdrop of statehomophobia, Russian queer activists attempt to find their ‘roots’ in linking to historicaland literary culture, and Russian and Soviet dissident history (Lukinmaa 2022). The roleof national and ethnic identity for queer activists in Kazakhstan and Russia differ signifi-cantly, with Kazakhstani activists continually engaging with the creation of a distinctlyKazakh queer identity. Conversely, Russian queer people described their national andethnic identity more ambiguously, mostly addressing the question of what it is like tobe queer in Russia, and offering little insight into what it meant for them to be Russianand to be queer. Furthermore, given the uncertainty around the meaning and the useof terminology to signify what it means to be Russian, it is difficult to interpret whetherparticipants in Polina’s study referred to ethnic or national identity and what these cat-egories meant for them.ConclusionsThis article debates the centrality of representational visibility politics (Edenborg 2019) inqueer activism in Kazakhstan and Russia. While many participants reproduce progressivistnarrative in pursuit of a Western emphasis on queer visibility (Kondakov 2021; Mizielinskaand Kulpa 2011), their narratives often express ambivalence towards participating inpublic queer activism. Another shared feature within narratives on queer activism inKazakhstan and Russia is that participants are aware of the tensions within the queer com-munity around activism and visibility, with most people being described as simplywanting a ‘quiet life’. Some referred to the portion of the queer community who doCENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY 15not want to associate themselves with political activism as ‘tema’. Furthermore, partici-pants in our studies separated queer activism from political activism, while others wereinvolved in political activism while at the time condemning queer activist circles andmethods. Participants from both countries argued that there is ‘helpful’ and ‘unhelpful’queer activism, often referring to alternative forms of activism as being more workable,given the risks associated with public visibility. The narratives on queer activism differmainly within the theme of Queer activism ≠ political activism. Kazakhstani participantsrarely mentioned the relationship between LGBT activism and wider politics in Kazakh-stan. Apart from a possible participant selection bias, this difference between theextent to which politics was spoken about among Russian and Kazakhstani participantsmay have arisen due to the fact that in 2017 when the interviews were conductedthere were no political protests in Kazakhstan that were widely discussed in a publicsphere, which contrasts to Polina’s context of ongoing protests in 2018 (Fomin and Nads-kakuła-Kaczmarczyk 2022). It is plausible to assume that had Mariya conducted her studyin 2022 (Kudaibergenova and Laruelle 2022), the picture would have been drasticallydifferent with possibly more narratives featuring political engagement. Lastly, weaddressed the question of the intersection of national, ethnic, and queer identities. Thisintersection was particularly important for queer people in Kazakhstan, who activelynegotiated their ethnic, cultural and queer identities, whereas in Russia this intersectionwas less significant.This article critiques the idea of a linear ‘evolutionistic and chronological path for anidentarian emancipation’ (Lukinmaa 2022, 320) for queer people in Kazakhstan andRussia. The two countries display wave-like changes in the levels of the public appearanceof queer activism. Russia’s conservative turn and increase in repressive legislation hasimpacted discourses around queer citizens in Kazakhstan. Nevertheless, Kazakhstan isnot just mirroring Russia’s homophobic politics. Indeed, while at the time of collectingour data in 2017–18, there was an increase in queer visibility in Russia and there werestill relatively few people engaging with public queer activism in Kazakhstan. Finishingthis article in 2023, the situation is drastically different, with repressive legislationaffecting Russian activists and with an increase in public queer visibility in Kazakhstan.Despite those fluctuations, alternative, often invisible or semi-visible, forms of activismare deemed to be consistently more important and useful in both countries.Notes1. In this article the use of ‘queer’ encompasses people who do not conform to normative sex-ualities and gender binary. Other terms such as ‘LGBT’, ‘LGBTQ+’, ‘gay’, ‘cisgender’ and ‘homo-sexual’ are used consistently with the self-identifications of participants and primary sourcescited.2. While Kazakhstan is identified in the literature as a hybrid regime that displays both demo-cratic and non-democratic elements of governance (Cameron and Orenstein 2012), thereare clear aspects of the authoritarian regime, specifically in the ability of the ruling elitesto occupy and dominate the crucial discourses related to political and cultural governance(Kudaibergenova and Shin 2018).3. All participants’ names and other identifiable details were either changed or omitted.

Terminology in relation to ethnicity is highly debated terrain Kazakhstan (e.g., Kesici 2011). InMariya’s study she uses ‘Kazakhs’ (‘Kazakhi’) and ‘Kazakhstani’ (‘Kazakhstantsy’), the former torefer to the Kazakh ethnic group and the latter to all groups (Kazakhs as well as more than 100other ethnic groups) who live within Kazakhstan’s territory and hold citizenship status. InRussia, the definition of Russian identity is highly debated and fluctuated with different pol-itical regimes and dominant discourses with divisions and inconsistent uses of ‘russkiĭ’ and‘rossiĭskiĭ’ – both words meaning ‘Russian’ (see Teper 2016 for a more detailed discussionof Russian identity).AcknowledgementsWewould like to express our gratitude to the editors of this special issue, Jasmin Dall’Agnola and CaiWilkinson, as well as to three anonymous reviewers, for their comments and constructive sugges-tions on how to improve this article.

    "abstract": "Western queer politics aspires to increase the visibility of queer subjects who have been highly regulated in Kazakhstan and Russia. Drawing on three interview studies conducted in 2017 and 2018 in Kazakhstan and Russia, respectively, this article examines and compares narratives on queer activism in both countries. Our findings reveal how visibility has an ambivalent meaning for queer people in these cases. For many, public queer activism is perceived as vulnerable and risky, therefore alternative, less ‘visible’, methods of activism are preferred and deemed more useful. For example, participants in our studies mentioned using social media, signing petitions and taking part in educational initiatives as alternative forms of queer activism. The article deliberates the pursuit and applicability of representational visibility politics within queer activism in Kazakhstan and Russia’s fluctuating contexts",
