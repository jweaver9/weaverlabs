Government has initiated some projects; such as BRT, MRT and elevated expressway; to improve the situation. Road pricing is very popular concept, which can be implemented in Dhaka with BRT and MRT as an integrated manner. Even though it is very popular concept not many countries except some developed countries implemented road pricing practically. None of the developing countries adopted this policy. For success of road pricing it has to be acceptable among the stakeholders. Public are the main stakeholders for road pricing.   This paper will explore whether road pricing will be acceptable in Dhaka considering only work trip in Dhaka. A sample of workers had been surveyed randomly. They were asked some demographic questions, such as age, gender, income and educational qualification; how they travelled to work; and whether they would accept road pricing; and if they would not accept road pricing the reasons behind that. Also respondents were given several hypothetical choices to see how respondents react with different road charge by choosing travel mode for their work trip.  The methodological approach taken for analysis is qualitative and quantitative analysis. For quantitative analysis Binary Logit Regression analysis was carried out to find out the significant factors for accepting or not accepting road pricing.     INTRODUCTION Dhaka; formerly known as Dacca, Decca and Jahangir Nagor under the rule of Mughal; is the capital city of Bangladesh and located beside the Buriganga River. Historically development of Dhaka city started from the southern part, which is the present ‘old town’ (Pre-Mughal Period) and then continued toward the west and north (Mughal and British periods). During the Pakistan period it developed towards the north (1). Following the Pakistan period some unplanned development occurred throughout Dhaka city. But transport planning and land use issues have not been taken very seriously. Because of absence of proper planning and uncontrolled population growth and urbanisation, Dhaka’s traffic condition is worsening. Government has initiated some projects; such as BRT, MRT and elevated expressway; to improve the situation.   Road pricing is a popular concept that can be implemented in Dhaka with BRT and MRT as an integrated manner. As according to economic theory, no utility should be free of cost (for example, public good). Market failure is believed to occur when a utility is free. Road space-time is widely regarded in the literature as a utility, so a common view of transport economists is that its usage ought to be charged. Even though it is very popular concept not many countries except some developed countries implemented road pricing practically. None of the developing countries adopted this policy. For success of road pricing it has to be acceptable among the stakeholders. Public are the main stakeholders for road pricing.  This research investigates the acceptability of adopting road pricing by workers in Dhaka with respect to a significant Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. Because BRT and road pricing both are very new concepts for the population of Dhaka, public acceptability would be a principal issue driving their success or failure. Sharmin Nasrin, Jonathan Bunker and Marc Miska                                        3  Only work trip will be explored for the research as for any city work trip is the significant trip purpose.  The methodological approach will be qualitative and quantitative analysis. For quantitative analysis Binary Logit regression analysis will be carried out to find out the significant factors and probability for not accepting road pricing by the working people in Dhaka.     LITERATURE REVIEW Many researchers have studied road pricing and its many issues, including de Palma and Lindsey (2); DeCorla-Souza and Barker (3); Jaensirisak, Sumalee (4); Goh (5); Proost and Sen (6); Olszewski and Xie (7); Tsekeris and Voß (8); Armelius and Hultkrantz (9); Attard and Ison (10); Levinson (11) and Armstrong-Wright (12).  Literature review for this paper is divided into two sections; road pricing and developing countries; and acceptability of road pricing.    Road pricing and developing countries  Road pricing in developing countries is still a questionable issue as none of the developing countries actually implemented road pricing yet. Some of the authors have addressed this issue in their research.  Armstrong-Wright (12) examines the specific problems of developing countries and the attempts which have been made to introduce policies of road pricing in a number of their cities. The result shows that, at the time, road pricing is technically feasible but its wider use is likely to be limited for some time by political factors.  Attard and Ison (10) discussed the issue of road pricing in the case of Valletta, Malta. They emphasized that other cities’ examples of road pricing should be kept in mind along with considering the local environment. They also stated that a scheme should be simple with good justification as to why the proposed scheme is the best solution; the issue of equity also should be clarified; and above all a political champion is a fundamental critical factor for road pricing to be successful.   Kirkpatrick (13) discussed the relevance of road pricing for developing countries and used Tanzania as his case study. He suggested that road pricing in a developing country should not be formulated solely on the basis of economic efficiency of resource allocation, but should give explicit attention to the importance of road user charge as a source of general development finance.  Acceptability of road pricing  Acceptability is the main obstacle for successful road pricing project. Acceptability issues can be overcome by making public transport more attractive; by addressing equity issue and by making whole transport operation system more transparent. Many authors in their research mentioned these issues. According to Jones (14) public acceptance is one of the main barriers to implement road pricing. Public acceptance is one of the main reasons for integrating BRT and road pricing.  Research conducted by Jaensirisak, Wardman et al. (15) revealed that, among many reasons, public transport is one of the main reasons that increase public acceptability for road pricing. When it has been stated in the policy that revenue Sharmin Nasrin, Jonathan Bunker and Marc Miska                                        4  earned from road pricing will be used for public transport improvement then road pricing is more acceptable to the public.  Schlag and Teubel (16) stated that road pricing is the least accepted demand management measure, According to his research road pricing may work when some of the issues such as equity, revenue allocation, effectiveness and efficiency are resolved. When road pricing is integrated with public transport improvement then these issues can be solved and road pricing will become more acceptable to public. Levinson (11) also addressed the equity issue with road pricing. He mentioned that equity issues can be addressed with intelligent mechanism design that provides the right incentives to travellers and uses the revenues raised in a way to achieve desired equitable ends. The examples include cutting other taxes and investing in infrastructure and services. Jaensirisak, Sumalee et al. (17) also emphasized that for public acceptance and making public transport very effective, road pricing and public transport should be integrated. Good public transport increases the price elasticity of car driving. If public transport conditions are very poor, for instance having insufficient frequency or low service quality, then car driving becomes very inelastic with respect to public transport and people tend to use the car more (14). Road pricing will serve as catalyst when many car drivers are forced to switch to BRT, as road pricing will increase motor vehicle operation and maintenance cost.  Armstrong-Wright (12) also stated that when road pricing is implemented public transport has to be adequate and suitable for handling motorists who have diverted to public transport due to road pricing. BRT reduces negative side effect of road pricing. Equity is one big concern with road pricing. It may be difficult for low income groups to afford road pricing. This can be solved with better public transit.  According to Pahaut and Sikow (18) those who will be negatively impacted by pricing may not benefit from the increased revenue. If revenue earned from road pricing is invested in BRT for instance, then this negative impact can be reduced.  Road pricing will increase public transport mode share. Public transport improvement is therefore necessary (19). So road pricing and BRT may together be adopted as part of a successful congestion mitigation strategy. Earnings from road pricing can be hypothecated to BRT operation. Improved transit service could attract more passengers thereby reducing car based travel demand.   Link to Dhaka experience  Considering Dhaka’s circumstances, funding is a big issue for road pricing implementation. For implementing any big project Bangladesh Government has to rely on a donor agency, like World Bank; JICA: ADB etc. Even though the Government is planning to implement BRT in Dhaka funding is an issue yet to be resolved for BRT. It could be implemented in stages and revenue earned from the first phase utilised to implement further phases. For Dhaka, the equity issue might be solved where BRT and road pricing are adopted in an integrated congestion mitigation strategy. Low income people are the captive market of public transport, as they can’t afford to drive cars. They have no choice other than using public transport, even though public transport service quality might be very poor. Low income people would benefit from improved quality of service under a strategy whereby BRT and road pricing are adopted in an integrated fashion. In Dhaka, however, motor vehicle users are more prone to take a stance against both BRT and road pricing. As BRT requires road space, it would reduce road capacity for car users, and furthermore road pricing Sharmin Nasrin, Jonathan Bunker and Marc Miska                                        5  creates extra cost to drive a car. BRT must be made more attractive in order to gain public acceptance and the case for road pricing needs to be made. Transparency will therefore be very important for success.  METHODOLOGY   Methodological approach taken for this study is qualitative and quantitative analysis of survey data on workers in Dhaka, which was conducted as part of PhD study. The analysis for this paper will be based on this survey. Qualitative analysis of the survey will explore the acceptability of road pricing by workers in Dhaka and also the reasons behind not accepting road pricing. Quantitative analysis will be binary logit analysis based on two income levels; low income (0-10000 Bangladeshi Taka or 0-120 AUD) and high income (10000+ Bangladeshi Taka or 120+ AUD).  OVERVIEW OF SURVEY DATA  The survey for this research was conducted from October 2011 to December 2011 as part of PhD study. The main objective of this survey was to identify the current travel behaviour and certain attitudes of Dhaka’s commuting workers. The questionnaire for the survey was divided into three parts, questions about respondents’ demographic circumstances; a revealed preference (RP) survey (i.e. actual market situation) and stated choice (SC) survey (i.e. hypothetical choices given to respondents to choose from). In the RP survey respondents were asked how they usually travel to work; how much time it takes; cost; the problems they faced etc, and whether they are ready to pay a road charge for using road. In the SC survey the same respondents who participated in RP survey and stated that they are ready to pay for road pricing were given another questionnaire with hypothetical options of integrated BRT and road pricing. Primary RP data for this research was collected for 426 subjects. Large sample size has been decided as it ensures good representation for the study. The scope of this paper is limited to analysis of the RP data.   The survey sample consisted of different occupational groups, who commute every day between their home and work place. Thus the unit of analysis was the worker rather than the organisation for which they work. A list of randomly selected organisations was generated from business directory (19). Organisations those had two employees or fewer excluded from the survey list. To remove biasness from the result sample has been collected randomly. The responsible authority at the organisation was contacted through email, phone or by personal visit, and with their consent respondents were issued with questionnaires. The questionnaire was explained to the respondents and a consent form completed. Participation was voluntary. The respondents gave their responses at their most convenient time including flexibility to take the questionnaire to home. The sample criteria are listed below:  Commuters who travel to work by public transport.  Commuters who travel to work by private car.  Commuters who travel to work by walk.  Commuters who travel to work by motorcycle.  Commuters whose main mode to work by staff buses, but still use some public transport to maintain connectivity with staff buses.  Both male and female workers surveyed.  All age commuting workers surveyed (usually from 18 to 70). Sharmin Nasrin, Jonathan Bunker and Marc Miska                                        6   Commuting workers from different locations surveyed to cover wide range of samples.  In the SC survey component respondents were given different hypothetical options to choose from. Choices have been formulated to keep in mind that road charge will be area wide and it will differ with vehicles and road pricing will be applicable to rickshaw, CNG/Mishuk, and car because all these create congestion on roads. Road pricing will not be applicable to BRT as that may increase BRT fare. A hypothetical situation was stated to the respondents. They were given a scenario that they live 5 km away from their work place and spend 100 BDT for one way journey to work. They were given six hypothetical options: Walk-BRT-Walk; Walk-BRT-Rickshaw; Rickshaw-BRT-Rickshaw; Rickshaw; CNG; Private Car each with three choices. It was mentioned that Rickshaw fare will be 20bDT/km (0.23 AUD/km) (average current rate); CNG fare will be 25tk/km (0.28 AUD/km) (average current rate) and in moderate congestion fuel (CNG driven) cost of car will be 7 tk/km (0.08 AUD/km) (average current rate). Road charge for rickshaw are 4 tk in choice 1; 8 tk in choice 2; and 12 tk in choice 3. For CNG road charge varies from 15 tk in choice 1; 25 tk in choice 2 to 35 tk in choice 3. For car road charges are 50, 60 and 70 tk for choice 1, choice 2 and choice 3 respectively. Figure 1illustrates the SC survey design.  Characteristics of survey data Characteristics such as gender, income, age, education of survey data are discussed in this section.   Gender  Among 426 respondents 264 (62%) were male and 162 (38%) female. According to a world bank report in Dhaka statistical metropolitan area women represent 33 percent of labour force (20). According to 2011 census in Dhaka males number 23814000 (51%) and female number 22915000 (49%). Census represents whole population whereas World Bank represents only the females who are working. Current survey is acceptable as percentage closely reflects World Bank data. The proportion of males is higher because many males migrate to the city for work leaving their wives in rural areas. Like other cities in Bangladesh, Dhaka is a male dominated society. Even though a relatively large proportion of the work force is female, the conservative society of Dhaka does not provide equitable independence to female inhabitants, such that proportionally less of the female population works than the male population.   Income Figure 2 apportions the income range of respondents. STP (21) study divides Dhaka’s population among different income groups. In STP (21) Dhaka’s population was divided into low (0-12,500 Bangladeshi Taka per month (Taka) (180 AUD per month), medium (12,500-55,000 Taka per month (180 AUD to 785 AUD Per month) and high (above 55,000 Taka per month, more than 785 AUD per month) income categories. Most people (96%) in Dhaka fall into the low and medium income groups. Data from the current survey also closely reflects this, although the higher income proportion is slightly higher, which is at least partially attributable to inflation.

The highest frequency of respondents’ age range is 26-35, followed by 36-45 age range. This indicates that dominant work force ranges from age 26 to 45 at a total of 65 percent. The Bangladesh Government has scheduled a retirement age of 60. With the exception of some private offices, most employers do not employ workers aged above 65.     FIGURE 5  Age distribution of survey sample  QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF REVEALED PREFERENCE DATA  In the revealed preference (RP) survey respondent were asked whether they would accept road pricing if it is implemented and if they were not ready to accept it the reasons behind for them not to accept it. If they stated they would accept road pricing then only they were given the questionnaire for stated choice (SC) survey.

The following section discusses whether workers would or would not accept road pricing.    Workers attitude towards road pricing Analysis of survey data shows that among half of the respondent stated they would accept road pricing if it is spend improving transport system. Out of this 52 percent respondent maximum is male. Distribution of road pricing acceptance and non acceptance shows that among male respondent seventy percent are in favour of road pricing and thirty percent are against it. Interestingly distribution female percentage is just opposite to male percentage. It is postulated that female workers are less in favour of road pricing because they are a vulnerable group in Dhaka, mostly falling into either the low or middle income category. Only 1 percent of female respondents revealed a high income, which reflects the exact situation in Dhaka. Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of road pricing acceptance and non-acceptance by gender.    FIGURE 6  Percentage of acceptability and non-acceptability of road pricing by gender of RP respondents  The percentages of acceptability and non-acceptability among different income groups are illustrated in Figure 7. Comparing income range and acceptability of road pricing for males and females together shows that road pricing is more acceptable to high income earners than low income earners, despite all respondents being presented with road pricing as a package that would give them an improved transport system. It is postulated that low income people are more reluctant towards a road charge because their income is much more sensitive to living costs. Therefore, acceptability of road pricing appears to depend on income in the case of Dhaka. However, among the low income earners who did not agree to accept road pricing because of non affordability, some stated that they would accept it if bus fare reduced within their affordable limit.  65 30 35 70 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Male Female Percentage No Yes Sharmin Nasrin, Jonathan Bunker and Marc Miska                                        11   FIGURE 7  Percentages of acceptability and non-acceptability of road pricing among different income range  Road pricing acceptance by education levels are illustrated in Figure 8. It is apparent that acceptability of road pricing depends on education levels, which may be because those who have more education have a better understanding of road pricing or they are more aware of and conscious about Dhaka’s traffic problem. Another explanation may be that people with little or no educational background have less income than those who have more education, so are less willing to pay.    FIGURE 8  Percentage of acceptance and non-acceptance of road pricing by education level   Road pricing acceptance by mode of transport is illustrated in figure 9. Eighty percent of CNG users are ready to accept road pricing. CNG users mentioned they chose CNG as their journey of mode for work trip because it takes less time and convenient. So if they get improved quality bus service, i.e. BRT, they would switch to BRT. Among the bus users more than 50 percent are in favour of road pricing as it had been stated road pricing would be implemented as an integrated manner with improved bus service. Among the rickshaw users also more than 50 percent are in favour of road pricing.

Among the car users only 20 percent are in favour of road pricing as they will be the most effected by road pricing by paying maximum amount of money as road pricing.      FIGURE 9  Percentage of acceptance and non-acceptance of road pricing by different transport mode users   Reasons for non-acceptance of Road Pricing All 426 subjects were asked an open question as to why they are not ready to accept road pricing. Respondents stated many reasons for non-acceptance of road pricing; with affordability being the main reason. Figure 10 illustrates the reasons for respondents not accepting road pricing. Of those respondents who stated that they would not accept road pricing, 61 percent stated non affordability as main reason notwithstanding, these 60 percent of respondents stated that they would accept road pricing if bus fare was reduced to a maximum fare of 5 Bangladeshi taka (0.06 AUD).

Those who stated that they would agree to pay road pricing were asked to choose a hypothetical option and a choice for that option, where a hypothetical scenario was given to them with integrated BRT and road pricing.  In table summarises the mode choice options before and after BRT and Road Pricing implementation. It can be seen that rickshaw users significantly switched their mode once BRT and Road Pricing starts operation. Most of the CNG users will continue using CNG and percentage of car users also will be reduced.

This is mainly because most of low income earners who now cannot afford any type of mode of transport chose this for their journey to work. Interestingly other than walk-BRT-walk option for all other options respondents chose choice 3, which has the maximum road charge. Sensitivity analysis of different road charge can show the actual effect of different road pricing on workers’ mode choice decision.   FIGURE 11 Percentage of respondents’ percentage for different choices for different options after BRT    BINARY LOGIT ANALYSIS   Logistic regression is type of regression analysis that is used for predicting depending variables based on several independent variables. Dependent variables can take two possible outcomes or multiple possible outcomes. When dependant variables take two possible outcomes then it is called binary logistic regression.   0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Percentage Stated Choice Options Choice 1 Choice 2 Choice 3 Sharmin Nasrin, Jonathan Bunker and Marc Miska                                        15  The equation 1 and 2 represent binary logistic regression and probability:                                           (1)                                                                   (2)  Where, X1, X2….  are independent variables.  a Constant b The coefficient of the predictor variable  For this paper the quantitative analysis were carried out based on Binary logit regression and SPSS statistical software was used for analysis. The whole data was segmented into different income levels for the analysis as considering Dhaka income is the most dominant factors of choosing mode. The data segmentation is listed in table 3.  TABLE 3  Data segregation for Binary Logit analysis Income Category Income Range Low Income range 0-10000 (tk) 1 High Income range 10000 + (tk) 1  Independent variables included for analysis are:   In vehicle time (minute)  Waiting time (minute)  Walk time/Access time to bus stop (minute)  Cost of travel (tk)  Distance of work place from home (km)  Model interpretation for low income worker    Model result shows that only walk time is the significant variable for this category. Table 4 stated the coefficient of variable for the model. B is negative for walk time or access time, which can be interpreted as if walk time or access time increase people will not choose road pricing. So this category people want the main improvement once road pricing implement is reduction of walk time. Also comparing with constant only model shows that adding variable in the model estimation increase the percentage of correct prediction. In the constant only model the percentage of correct prediction is 74.4 whereas with the variable the percentage is 77.8. Hosmer and Lemeshow (H-L) test showed that model is significant as significance is less than 0.05.

Analysis showed that in Dhaka road pricing will be acceptable by commuters but some of the issues have to be resolved. Most of the low 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 10 20 40 60 80 100 Probability In Vehicle Time (Minute) Probability Sharmin Nasrin, Jonathan Bunker and Marc Miska                                        18  income earners stated that they would not accept road pricing because they cannot afford it. They mentioned at current situation they cannot afford any transport modes for going to their work place so it is unrealistic for them to pay for road pricing. But if properly planned, road pricing can be a good opportunity for them as revenue earned from road pricing can be utilized to subsidies BRT system or low income earners’ bus fare in Dhaka. It is worth mentioning here that current Government plan is to increase the current bus fare once BRT is implemented in Dhaka. So again these low income workers cannot be the customer of BRT. Some other issues that respondents stated for not accepting road pricing are government’s poor administration that can be improved by making operation, planning and implementation of transport system more transparent. Government has planned for different organizations for BRT and MRT in Dhaka, which is very good initiative for Government to make transport system more transparent.   Stated choice survey data shows that there would be significant modal change once integrated road pricing and BRT start operation.  Survey data shows that almost 60 percent workers will choose BRT for their work trip and only 5 percent will use car for their work trip where as RP data shows car users are almost 9 percent. Also significant workers will shift from Rickshaw to BRT. These people will choose rickshaw as their access mode to BRT stop once integrated BRT and road pricing start operation. Sensitivity analysis of road charge and BRT fare will give indication of effect of different road charge and BRT fare on workers mode choice decision.  Quantitative analysis of survey data were carried on survey data segmented by different income range as choosing transport mode depends on income in Dhaka.  Education is highly correlated with income in Dhaka. Highly educated people generally earn high income and those who have little education background are in low income group. Analysis shows that for low income workers access time or walk time is the only significant variable for them to accept road pricing. If implementing road pricing reduce their walk time then the probability for them to accept road pricing increases. For high income earner the significant variable for accepting road pricing is in vehicle time. So after implementing road pricing if in vehicle time for high income people for going to work reduce then the probability of accepting road pricing will be more by high income group.  REFERENCES  1.

    "abstract": "Dhaka, which is the capital of Bangladesh, is facing serious traffic congestion and whole traffic situation in Dhaka is in chaos. Government has initiated some projects; such as BRT, MRT and elevated expressway; to improve the situation. Road pricing is very popular concept, which can be implemented in Dhaka with BRT and MRT as an integrated manner. Even though it is very popular concept not many countries except some developed countries implemented road pricing practically. None of the developing countries adopted this policy. For success of road pricing it has to be acceptable among the stakeholders. Public are the main stakeholders for road pricing. This paper will explore whether road pricing will be acceptable in Dhaka considering only work trip in Dhaka. A sample of workers had been surveyed randomly. They were asked some demographic questions, such as age, gender, income and educational qualification; how they travelled to work; and whether they would accept road pricing; and if they would not accept road pricing the reasons behind that. Also respondents were given several hypothetical choices to see how respondents react with different road charge by choosing travel mode for their work trip. The methodological approach taken for analysis is qualitative and quantitative analysis. For quantitative analysis Binary Logit Regression analysis was carried out to find out the significant factors for accepting or not accepting road pricing",
