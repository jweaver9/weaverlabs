The two-day training program, which was one component of the NYC DOE’s Respect for All initiative, was implemented so that every secondary school in the district had at least one staff member who could support lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) students and combat all forms of bias-based bullying and harassment, particularly bias based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. In order to evaluate Year One of the training program, GLSEN surveyed 813 educators who participated in the training at three times – before the training, six weeks after, and six months after. Training participants were also compared to educators who had not yet completed the training. Focus groups were conducted in order to gain a greater, in-depth understanding of participants’ experiences in the training. Key findings are listed below.Compared to before the training, after the training educators demonstrated increased:Knowledge of appropriate terms;■■Access to LGBTQ-related resources;■■Awareness of how their own practices might ■■have been harmful to LGBTQ students;Empathy for LGBTQ students;■■Belief in the importance of intervening in anti-■■LGBTQ remarks; Communication with students and staff about ■■LGBTQ issues;Engagement in activities to create safer ■■schools for LGBTQ students (i.e., supporting Gay-Straight Alliances, including LGBTQ content in curriculum); andFrequency of intervention in anti-LGBTQ ■■name-calling, bullying, and harassment.In addition, compared to educators who had not yet participated in the training, those who had participated in the training indicated higher levels of:Knowledge of appropriate terms;■■Access to LGBTQ-related resources;■■Empathy for LGBTQ students;■■Communication with students and staff about ■■LGBTQ issues; andEngagement in activities to create safer ■■schools for LGBTQ students.Findings from the Year One evaluation demonstrate that this training program is an effective means for developing the competency of educators to address bias-based bullying and harassment, and to create safer school environments for LGBTQ students. The findings suggest that providing such training to all school staff, including administrators, would result in an even stronger effect on the school environment. Furthermore, ensuring sufficient opportunities for developing educators’ skills in intervening in anti-LGBTQ behaviors could enhance the effectiveness of trainings. To maintain the benefits of training, staff should receive continued and advanced professional development opportunities related to supporting LGBTQ students and combating bias-based bullying and harassment. vYear One Evaluation of the Respect for All Training Programvi1Year One Evaluation of the Respect for All Training ProgramBullying, harassment, and name-calling affect millions of students every year and can have damaging consequences on students’ physical safety, emotional well-being, and educational achievement. Two of the most common reasons students are victimized in school are their actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender expression (i.e., how masculine or feminine they are believed to be).1 Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students are at particular risk for in-school victimization and almost all LGBT students are harassed in school because of their sexual orientation or gender expression.2 These high levels of in-school victimization may have negative effects on students’ self-esteem and mental health, and are associated with decreased academic performance, lower educational aspirations, and increased rates of absenteeism.3However, intervention by supportive educators can significantly improve the educational outcomes for LGBT students and reduce the incidence of anti-LGBT bullying, harassment, and name-calling. Not only is effective intervention related to decreased levels of in-school victimization, but research demonstrates that LGBT students who can identify supportive school staff report a greater sense of safety at school, skip school less often, perform better academically, and have a stronger commitment to continuing their education through high school and beyond.4To help create safer schools for all students, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning5 (LGBTQ) students, the New York City Department of Education (NYC DOE) launched the Respect for All initiative in 2007. The initiative includes efforts to notify all students, parents, and staff about the district policy (Chancellor’s Regulation A-832) prohibiting student-to-student bias-based bullying, harassment, and intimidation and the related reporting procedures. It also mandates that each school have at least one designated staff member to whom reports about bias-based bullying, harassment or intimidation can be made. As part of the initiative, the district also provides training for staff from each school. Specifically, the NYC DOE has developed and implemented a two-day training program for secondary school educators on addressing bias-related bullying and harassment, with a specific focus on bullying and harassment on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.inTroduCTionacknowledgementsThe year one evaluation of the Respect for All training program was made possible by much-appreciated grants from the Arcus Gay and Lesbian Fund and the Heckscher Foundation for Children.The authors also wish to thank the educators who participated in the study for sharing their experiences and perspectives.

GLSEN was a lead content provider for the training curriculum, and the training was delivered by trainers from all five organizations. GLSEN’s Research Department conducted the evaluation of the training program. The program was piloted in the summer of 2007, and then fully implemented throughout the 2007–2008, 2008–2009, and 2009–2010 school years. The evaluation of the training program is a multi-year project, but this report describes findings from the evaluation of the first year of the program (2007–2008). Program Goals and Theory of ChangeThe NYC DOE lists five main goals of this training program: Build the capacity of school personnel to 1. actively promote a community of inclusion in each school so that all students feel both safe and respectedIncrease the likelihood that school personnel 2. will intervene when witnessing anti-LGBTQ language, harassment, and/or bullyingBuild the capacity of school personnel to serve 3. as a resource and support for students who may be lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioningBuild the capacity of school personnel 4. to serve as a resource for other school personnel regarding issues faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning students Decrease hurtful, offensive, or exclusionary 5. language and/or practicesGLSEN’s evaluation and curriculum development team created a model of the underlying program theory, i.e., a description of how the program is believed to accomplish its goals. As illustrated in Figure 1, the program aims to influence educators’ awareness, knowledge, and beliefs, resulting in a desired change in behaviors. Specifically, the program was expected to directly increase participants’:Awareness of prevalence of anti-LGBTQ ■■behaviors in school;Self-awareness regarding own behaviors and ■■professional practices;Knowledge of LGBTQ-related terminology;■■Empathy for LGBTQ students;■■Understanding of the importance of ■■intervening in anti-LGBTQ remarks;Knowledge of and access to LGBTQ-related ■■resources; and Self-efficacy related to the desired  ■■behaviors. Further, we proposed that the increases in participants’ awareness, knowledge, and beliefs would result in (see also Figure 1):An increase in participants’ intervention in anti-■■LGBTQ behaviors;An increase in participants’ engagement in ■■efforts to create safer schools;An increase in participants’ communication ■■with students and other staff about LGBTQ issues; and A decrease in participants’ use of hurtful ■■language.For the evaluation of the first year of the Respect for All training program, we examined whether the program had a direct effect on participants’ awareness, knowledge, and beliefs, and on their behaviors.abouT The resPeCT for all TraininG ProGram4Program implementation A formal invitation was sent from the DOE Office of School and Youth Development to all New York City principals in public schools serving grades six and above requesting that they select between one and four staff to attend the training. During the 2007–2008 school year, 69 trainings were delivered to 1,054 educators from 248 schools, drawn from all five boroughs of New York City. Educators from the remainder of the District’s approximately 750 middle and high schools were designated to receive the training during the second and third years of the training program (2008–2009 and 2009–2010, respectively). Each training session was facilitated by two trainers drawn from the five collaborating organizations. The two-day training curriculum incorporated a variety of educational techniques, including: group discussions, mini-lectures, videos, and role-plays. Training participants were provided with a variety of materials and resources, including activities to use with students and posters to be displayed in their school stating the school district policy and identifying the staff contact for reporting incidents of bias-based intimidation and bullying.Figure 1.

Training participants were asked to complete questionnaires that assessed their awareness, knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors related to the school experiences of LGBTQ students and anti-LGBT bias in schools. Questionnaires were administered to participants at three points in time: immediately prior to the training (Time 1), six weeks following the training (Time 2), and six months following the training (Time 3). After the Year One trainings had concluded, we also conducted three focus groups, in order to gain a greater, in-depth understanding of participants’ experiences in the training, including their assessment of which components were most and least effective. A total of 813 educators participated in the evaluation study (see Table 1 for information about the study sample). The majority of these participants were teachers (46.2%) and counselors or school social workers (31.7%). Just over one-third (36.7%) worked in middle schools, almost half (42.9%) worked in high schools, and 5.8% worked in both middle and high schools. Over two-thirds of participants were female (67.7%) and less than one-tenth (7.0%) identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. The majority (60.5%) had not received any prior training on lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) issues.evaluaTion meThods Table 1.

These changes in participants’ awareness, knowledge and beliefs would, in turn, result in changes in behaviors related to combating anti-LGBTQ bias (e.g., an increase in intervention in anti-LGBTQ remarks). In order to assess the veracity of this theory, i.e., whether participants’ awareness, knowledge, and beliefs were, in fact, related to their behaviors, we examined the relationships between participants’ awareness, knowledge, and beliefs and participants’ behaviors at Time 1. There were significant relationships in the predicted direction, such that participants with higher levels of awareness, knowledge, and beliefs had higher levels of the desired behaviors and lower levels of the undesired behavior, i.e., use of anti-LGBTQ language (see Table 2 for correlation statistics). These findings provided evidence to support the program’s theory of change that changing participants’ awareness, knowledge, and beliefs, as a result of the Respect for All training, would result in a change in their behaviors that would contribute to a more supportive school environment for LGBTQ and all students.Participants’ assessment of impact of Training ProgramIn both the post-training questionnaires (at Time 2 and Time 3) and in the focus groups, participants were asked a series of questions about their opinions of the training, including how the training may have affected their knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and professional practices. Overall, participants indicated that the training was extremely beneficial and many indicated it was one of the best trainings they had experienced; as one middle school math teacher said, “I still believe the training was among the best orchestrated training sessions I have ever attended.” Participants referred to both the facilitators of the training and the training content as reasons for its success.“It was a wonderful and informative training. It was fun, the presenters were in tune, bright, and articulate. They kept the training live and fun and were very supportive of questions, comments, and concerns. I hope that the training will continue for all.” – High School Counselor/Social Worker“The training was great. The hands on activities were amazing and it was fun and interesting. I wish we had more training like this.” – High School Math Teacher The participants not only valued the training themselves, but many advocated for all school staff to receive this training. In addition to finding the training to be a generally worthwhile experience for all educators, some participants indicated that providing training to one or only a few staff in their school was not sufficient. They believed that in order to ensure their schools were safe for LGBTQ students, more staff should receive the training. “I think the Respect for All training should be mandatory for all people who work with students.” – High School Health Teacher “Great training, it should be mandatory for teachers, administrators, and anyone who comes in contact with children in the schools.” – Middle School Counselor/Social Worker “Excellent training. I wish all school staff were mandated to take it. I think there should be special trainings for principals about these issues, being that they are the ones that will OK clubs and any other activities related to LGBTQ students in the school.” – High School Social Studies Teacher Intervention in Anti-LGBTQ BehaviorsAt Time 3, participants were asked if the training had caused them to do anything differently in their resulTs8Table 2.

Correlation statistics range from -1.0 to 1.0 with -1.0 indicating a perfectly negative relationship (i.e., as one variable increases, the other variable decreases), 1.0 indicating a perfectly positive relationship (i.e., as one variable increases, the other variable increases), and 0.0 indicating no relationship. Generally, in social science research, a correlation of either direction (- or +) lower than .30 is considered to indicate a slight relationship, a correlation between .30-.50 to indicate a moderate relationship, and a correlation above .50 to indicate a strong relationship (see Cohen, 1988.

Table 3 shows the specific things these educators reported having done differently as a result of participating in the training. The most common change reported by the participants was that, after the training, they were more likely to intervene when hearing anti-LGBTQ language in schools.“I have made a more concerted effort to watch what I say (and what I DON’T say) when I am in the classrooms. I have truly come to consider the importance of intervening EVERY TIME I hear a homophobic (even unintentionally hurtful language) remark.” – High School English Teacher“Before the training, I let more things go by without commenting on them if a student said them. I am more attuned to what is being said and trying to intervene when things are inappropriate.” – Middle School ESL Teacher “When I hear others making gay derogatory remarks, I say something. I didn’t do that before—didn’t even realize just how derogatory those statements are, e.g. ‘That’s so gay.’” – High School Parent CoordinatorAwareness of Anti-LGBTQ BiasAnother commonly reported effect of the training was an increase in awareness – both about the experiences of LGBTQ youth in school and the pervasiveness of bias related to sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression, including participants’ own biased beliefs.“I have thought more about how an LGBTQ student might experience my class and others within the school, and how I could make his or her experience safer and more positive.” – High School English Teacher “I am much more aware of how we expect kids to act based on their gender—and see how much bias there is based on students’ behavior and whether it conforms to our expectations of how boys and girls are supposed to act.” – Middle and High School Librarian“I have become more aware of my own bias regarding a lot of things and have begun to change the way I think about things. In doing so, I have begun to watch what I say to other people—and especially my students. I have Table 3.

Some participants indicated that they took what they learned and educated other school staff, both in formal and informal ways. “I’ve been able to provide both staff and students with FACTUAL information about LGBT history. I also hope to facilitate a PD [professional development] for staff at my school on this topic.” – High School Physical Education Teacher “Having attended the training made me an ‘expert’ in the eyes of my principal, and this gave me a stronger voice amongst the staff on these issues.” – High School Physics Teacher However, not all participants felt equipped to return to their school and educate other staff on these issues. As one middle school counselor/social worker stated, “It was so good, but I do not feel I have the skills to facilitate such a training for the staff.” However, even if they were not comfortable conducting training themselves, some participants worked with their school’s administration to organize trainings to educate school staff on the issues (and in some cases, brought in the Respect for All training itself).“I have attempted to have a training workshop brought to my school. I think the next step is to educate more faculty members.” – High School Parenting Teacher “Started to plan training for staff about issues, and how we can create safer community for our students.” – High School Counselor/Social Worker Communication with Students about LGBTQ IssuesParticipants also indicated that the training enhanced their ability to communicate with students about LGBTQ issues. They reported an increase in their ability to address these issues with students in general, and to provide support to LGBTQ students in particular. “I have felt more confident in addressing stu-dents, whether in large groups or individually, regarding LGBTQ issues and stereotypes.” – High School Counselor/Social Worker“I am much more confident in my ability to talk to students about gender/sexuality issues; whereas before the training I felt sympathetic but was hesitant to speak up.” – High School Counselor/Social Worker“I have been open and have felt comfortable with a student who came to talk to me about gender issues.” – Middle School Counselor/Social Worker “[The training] has made it easier to be supportive of students who are LGBTQ and offer them resources as well as helps me feel more comfortable with the correct language to use.” – High School Counselor/Social WorkerOther Efforts to Create Safer SchoolsSome educators reported that the training inspired them to take action to create safer, more inclusive schools and that they subsequently engaged in a variety of proactive steps, such as: making themselves a visible ally to students experiencing bias-based bullying or harassment; implementing educational programming to combat anti-LGBTQ bias and harassment; working with student clubs, e.g., Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs); and including LGBT people, history, and events in the curriculum.“Posted the posters to let the students know that I am here for them.” – Middle School Counselor/Social Worker“Gotten involved with No Name-Calling Week, trying to set up an LGBT panel.” – Middle School Language Arts Teacher11Year One Evaluation of the Respect for All Training Program“I have had more impetus to organize events and to continue working with the GSA.”  – Middle and High School Librarian“I have implemented more LGBTQ history into my lessons and class discussions; just informally mentioning contributions that people in the gay community have made to society.”  – High School Mentor Some participants indicated that the training led them to incorporate these issues into their curriculum. However, other participants wished the training had provided more materials they could use directly with students, such as grade-level specific lesson plans.Not only did training participants report changes in their own attitudes and behaviors, but some also maintained that the changes in their practices directly resulted in a change in student behavior. “Before the training I was unsure how to respond to comments such as ‘that’s so gay.’ Since I’ve begun addressing them, I’ve found that students are much more aware of what they’re saying and it’s created a more tolerant classroom. Students have even told me that they have stopped using the phrase outside of class because they realized how often they were using it.” – High School English Teacher “I am much more vocal with the students as a group in addressing unnecessary comments like ‘that’s so gay’ rather than waiting to pull a child aside. This has helped me ease into deeper discussions with all of the students so that the possible damaging effects of seemingly ‘innocent’ phrases are obvious to them now. The students, as a whole, are more cautious of the things they say and more aware of the concept that they don’t know everything about each other; there is a deepened sense of respect.” – Middle School Math Teacher Changes in Participants  over TimeAlthough the findings from participants about their own beliefs regarding how the training was useful provides us with some indication of training effectiveness, it was also important to objectively examine changes over time using survey measures of the educators’ awareness, knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors. Specifically, we examined changes in participants’ responses to questionnaire items over time — before the training (Time 1), six week after the training (Time 2), and six months after the training (Time 3).6Changes in AwarenessThe main objectives of the training program were to decrease participants’ own use of anti-LGBTQ language, increase intervention in anti-LGBTQ language, increase engament efforts to create safer schools, and increase communication with students and staff about LGBTQ issues. To this end, the training attempted to raise participants’ awareness of the prevalence of anti-LGBTQ language, bullying, and harassment in schools and their self-awareness regarding their own practices.Participants were asked to report on their reflection on their own professional practices and about the climate in their schools for LGBTQ students. After the training, there were no significant changes in training participants’ levels of awareness regarding school climate, i.e., their assessment of the frequency of anti-LGBTQ language, bullying, and harassment at their school. There were, however, marginal differences in training participants’ self-awareness regarding their own practices, such as considering how their actions might affect LGBTQ students or thinking about whether their language is inclusive of LGBT people (see Table 4). Participants indicated they were more self-aware six weeks after the training than before the training. Although by six months following the training (Time 6 Changes over time were examined through repeated measures hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). HLM is a statistical technique that allows for examination of differences in individual’s responses over time, accounting for similarities at each time point (e.g., responses to questions at Time 1 share similarities because they are given at the same time point, as do responses to questions at Time 2). Another advantage of using HLM is that, unlike traditional single level modeling (e.g., multiple analysis of variance), multilevel modeling allows for data from all participants to be examined in the analyses, regardless of whether they completed questionnaires for all the time points. Differences over time were considered statistically significant at the level of p<.05 and marginally significant at p<.10.The over-time analyses controlled for individual characteristics related to the outcome variables of interest. To determine which characteristics were related to outcome variables, we conducted a regression analysis for each of the outcome variables (e.g., empathy, knowledge of LGBT terminology) with the variables that assessed individual characteristics of the participants. The individual characteristics that were predictors of the outcome variables of interest were then treated as covariates, these were: LGBT identity, gender, role or position in school, previous training on LGBT issues, and reasons for attending the training. Length of time working in the district was not predictive of any of the outcome variables of interest and thus was not included as a covariate. In addition, to address potential bias of the time of year that the questionnaires were completed, all analyses controlled for the month that the training occurred.123), participants’ levels of self-awareness were not significantly different from before the program (Time 1). Thus, although the training may have an initial effect on their awareness, it may not have a long-lasting effect without additional intervention or training. Changes in KnowledgeOne of the primary goals of the Respect for All training program was to build the capacity of school personnel to actively promote a community of inclusion in the school so that all students feel both safe and respected. To this end, the training focused on increasing participants’ knowledge of Table 4.

Findings show that participants were more knowledgeable about LGBTQ-related terminology (e.g., transgender, heterosexism) after the training at Time 2 and this increase continued to be evident at Time 3 – the percentage of correctly identified terms increased from 79.3% at Time 1 to 86.6% at Time 3 (see Table 4). After the training, participants were also more likely to report knowing where to find LGBTQ-related resources (see also Table 4). At Time 3, the level of agreement with the statement “I know where to find LGBTQ related resources” was higher than at Time 1 (3.37 vs. 2.95). In addition, participants’ reports on the frequency of actively seeking out information related to LGBTQ students was also higher after the training, at both Time 2 and Time 3 (see also Table 4). Thus, findings from the analysis of training participants over time demonstrate that the training did increase participants’ capacity by building their knowledge of appropriate language and increasing their access to relevant resources.Changes in BeliefsThe training was designed to affect certain beliefs that would foster positive actions (i.e., intervention in anti-LGBTQ behavior) and discourage negative behaviors (i.e., using hurtful language). Specifically, the training intended to increase participants’ empathy for LGBTQ students and sense of obligation to intervene in anti-LGBTQ remarks. Results show that after the training (both at Time 2 and Time 3), participants’ beliefs about the importance of intervening when hearing homophobic remarks or comments about someone’s gender expression, i.e., acting “too masculine” or “too feminine,” increased from Time 1 to Time 2 and that increase remained at Time 3 (see Table 4). Six weeks following the training (Time 2), participants also reported a greater level of empathy for LGBTQ students, i.e., increased understanding of these students’ experiences in school and concern for how students are adversely affected by these experiences (see also Table 4). However, although participants’ reported level of empathy was higher at Time 3 than before the training (Time 1), the difference was not statistically significant. Although, the non-significance may be related to a lack of statistical power needed to detect a small effect with a small sample. Nevertheless, it is possible that the training effects an immediate change in empathy, but that this increase may diminish overtime without further intervention.According to the training’s theory of change, the training was expected to increase participants’ self-efficacy (i.e., their comfort level and self-confidence) related to dealing with LGBTQ issues in school. Therefore, participants were asked at all three time points about their comfort in talking with students about LGBTQ issues, their comfort in intervening when hearing anti-LGBTQ remarks, and their confidence in their abilities to create an inclusive school environment or use supportive language. There were no significant differences over time in participants’ comfort level in talking with students about LGBTQ issues or their levels of confidence in their abilities to create an inclusive school environment and use supportive language. In addition, participants’ comfort levels intervening when hearing anti-LGBTQ remarks actually decreased over time, indicating that participants felt less comfortable intervening after the training then they did prior to the training. Perhaps, by discussing possible real-life situations that educators might experience, some were faced with the realization that they might not be as equipped to respond as they initially believed themselves to be. Changes in BehaviorsThere are certain key actions that educators can take to ensure that schools are safe and welcoming for all students, including LGBTQ students. These actions include: intervening in anti-LGBTQ language; engaging in efforts to create safe schools (i.e., including LGBTQ-related information in their curricula, supporting Gay-Straight Alliances); communicating with students and other school staff about LGBTQ-related issues; and decreasing their own use of anti-LGBTQ language. Therefore, the training was designed to increase the desirable behaviors and decrease the undesirable behaviors among participants. Intervention in anti-LGBTQ language was one of the key behaviors addressed in the training. In order to assess whether the training did increase educators’ intervention, participants were asked about the frequency with which they intervened when hearing anti-LGBTQ language before the training at Time 1, and after the training, at Time 2 and Time 3. As illustrated in Table 4, findings from the analyses of responses over time indicate that training participants reported more frequent intervention when hearing anti-LGBTQ remarks at Time 2, six weeks after the training, than they did prior to the training, at Time 1. However, this increase in frequency of intervention 14was not maintained at Time 3, six months following the training. This finding suggests that a single training experience may not be sufficient to sustain long-term behavior change in the realm of intervention, and that additional supports, such as “booster” training sessions or continued coaching, may be indicated to help educators maintain more vigilant intervention in school.The Respect for All program had the expectation that training participants would become active in efforts to help create safer and more supportive school environments for LGBTQ students. The program intended that these educators would become point people in their school, bringing back information to their colleagues, serving as a resource to students, and otherwise increasing their level of engagement in efforts to create safe schools for LGBTQ students, such as including positive information about LGBTQ people in their curricula or supporting a student club designed to support LGBTQ students and combat homophobia (e.g., a Gay-Straight Alliance). Many participants reported in their open-ended responses that they found that the training helped them to become more active in their schools related to LGBTQ issues. In order to assess whether their actions did actually increase over time, at each of the three time points, participants were asked a single question about their engagement in safe school efforts for LGBTQ students and several questions about the frequency with which they spoke with their colleagues and with students about these issues. As shown in Table 4, on all of these indicators, participants’ level of reported engagement in and communication about LGBTQ issues significantly increased after the training at Time 2 and the increases were maintained at Time 3. Thus, participants were more likely to be engaged in safer school activities and more likely to be discussing LGBTQ issues with their colleagues and with students six months after having attended the training.One of the program’s objectives was to decrease educators’ own use of anti-LGBTQ language. However, there were no significant changes over time in the frequency of use of anti-LGBTQ language. This was not entirely surprising given participants reported relatively low frequency of using this type of language, even prior to the training. For example, less than 2.0% of educators reported using homophobic language “often” or “very often” around their co-workers.differences between educators Who had Training and  educators Who had not As discussed in the previous section, we observed within person changes over time (before the training and after the training). However, because we did not have a direct comparison group in this study (i.e., a group of educators who did not participate in the training program), we cannot know for sure whether the changes over time can be attributed to the training. Thus, in order to see whether changes were a result of the training, we compared responses from those completed the training with those who had not completed the training.7As illustrated in Table 5, we found that compared to educators who had not yet participated in the training, educators who had completed the training:Were more knowledgeable about LGBTQ-■■related terminology;Were more likely to know where to find ■■LGBTQ-related resources;Were more likely to have sought out LGBTQ-■■related materials and information;Had higher levels of empathy for LGBTQ ■■students;Communicated with staff about LGBTQ issues ■■more often;Talked with a greater number of students ■■about LGBTQ issues; andWere more engaged in activities to create ■■safer schools for LGBTQ students (i.e., supporting Gay-Straight Alliances, including LGBTQ content in curriculum).7 Differences between groups were examined through a series of analyses of covariances (ANCOVAs) and were considered statistically significant at p<.05 and marginally significant at p<.10. Comparison-group analyses controlled for the month the training occurred and relevant individual characteristics: LGBT identity, gender, role or position in school, previous training on LGBT issues, and reasons for attending the training. Responses from participants at Time 1 (before the training) were compared with responses from participants who completed the Time 2 questionnaire in the same month. For example, responses from Time 1 questionnaires completed in November were compared to responses from Time 2 questionnaires completed in November.15Year One Evaluation of the Respect for All Training ProgramTable 5.

It is important to note that this training was one component of the broader Respect for All initiative. Thus, findings from this evaluation provide information only about the training for secondary school staff, not about the other aspects of the initiative, such as the notification requirements regarding school policies or the designation of one staff from each school to receive reports of bias-based behaviors. An assessment of the implementation and effectiveness of the other components of the initiative would provide an understanding of the impact of the Respect for All initiative as a whole.Findings from the Year One evaluation demonstrate that the training program is an effective means for developing the competency of secondary school staff to address name-calling, bullying, and harassment on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression, and to create safer school environments for LGBTQ students. Participants reported that the training was very useful and helped them become more supportive of LGBTQ students. They stated that the training made them more aware of anti-LGBTQ bias in their schools and in themselves, more sensitive to needs of LGBTQ students, and more confident in their abilities to address these issues. Furthermore, they claimed that, as a result of the training, they intervened in anti-LGBTQ remarks more often, made efforts be more inclusive in their own practices, and talked with students and staff about these issues. In addition, participants indicated that the training encouraged them to take action in their school, such as including LGBTQ-content in their curriculum and working with their school’s Gay-Straight Alliance. Similar to educators’ qualitative self-reports of the impact of the training, findings from the quantitative data demonstrate that the training had significant positive effects. Both the over-time analyses and the comparison-group analyses provide evidence that the training increased participants’:Knowledge of appropriate terms;■■Access to LGBTQ-related resources;■■Empathy for LGBTQ students;■■Communication with students and staff about ■■LGBTQ issues; andEngagement in activities to create safer ■■schools for LGBTQ students (i.e., supporting Gay-Straight Alliances, including LGBTQ content in curriculum).Additionally, findings from the over-time analyses suggest that the training increased participants’:Awareness of how their own practices might ■■have been harmful to LGBTQ students; Beliefs in the importance of intervening in anti-■■LGBTQ remarks; andFrequency of intervention in anti-LGBTQ ■■name-calling, bullying, and harassment. Findings from both the over-time analyses and the qualitative data indicate that the training had an effect on awareness of educators’ own practices, beliefs in the importance of intervention, and intervention in anti-LGTBQ language. Yet, the comparison-group analyses did not find these effects. Therefore, we cannot be sure that the training actually caused these changes. However, because the analyses controlled for the month that the training occurred, it is unlikely that these observed changes were due to historical effects. Nonetheless, we cannot be certain that the changes observed over time in awareness, beliefs about the importance of intervention, and frequency of intervention were related to participation in the training. For some of the expected training outcomes  – increased self-efficacy, enhanced awareness of anti-LGBTQ bias in schools, and decrease in use of anti-LGBTQ language – the findings from the quantitative data did not support the positive effects described in the qualitative data. It is possible that these effects were not strong enough for us to detect in the quantitative data. Perhaps the evaluation of the full training program (Years One, Two, and Three), because of the larger sample size, will yield statistically significant effects in these areas. However, it is also possible that the training does not actually affect participants in these areas. For example, regarding participants’ awareness of anti-LGBTQ bias in schools, it may be that participants had high awareness of the prevalence of anti-LGBTQ bias in schools prior to the training, ConClusions and imPliCaTions18and that the information included in the training about bias in schools was not extensive enough to increase participants’ existing awareness. Efforts to develop specific skills, such as direct instruction, modeling, and practice, are generally required to enhance self-efficacy (i.e., self-confidence, comfort level).  Although the Respect for All training did include some opportunity for skill development, it constituted a relatively small portion of the training.  The majority of the training was largely devoted to raising awareness, increasing knowledge, and developing empathy.  Thus, it is not entirely surprising that results from the quantitative analyses failed to indicate a significant positive effect of the training program on participants’ self-efficacy related to communicating with students, intervening in anti-LGBTQ behaviors, or promoting an inclusive school environment. Perhaps an increased focus on skill-building in the training program (i.e., how to intervene when hearing anti-LGBTQ language, respond to students who need support, or support Gay-Straight Alliances or similar student clubs) would lead to an increase in participants’ self-efficacy, eventually resulting in even greater increases in participants’ intervention, communication with students, and engagement in efforts to create safer schools. The findings from this evaluation provide promising evidence that an in-depth training program specifically focused on ensuring LGBTQ students’ safety in school can successfully prepare school staff for their role in maintaining a welcoming and safe environment for all students, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. To be most effective, trainings should include not only information about LGBTQ students’ experiences in school, but also concrete strategies for creating safe environments, including supporting LGBTQ students and intervening in biased remarks, bullying, and harassment. The Respect for All training provided opportunity for discussion about and some practice in specific techniques for dealing with these issues, thus resulting not only in changes in participants’ knowledge, awareness, and beliefs, but changes in their actual behaviors, as well. The Respect for All program provides a two-day intensive training to a few key school staff so that they can serve as a support to LGBTQ students and a resource to the entire school community about bias-based bullying, harassment, and intimidation. This evaluation examined the impact of the training on those educators who participated, but not its effect on the school environment as a whole. However, many of the participants reported that the training inspired them to work for change in their schools, and the results from the over-time and comparison-group analyses indicate that after the training, participants were more engaged in efforts to create a safer and more inclusive school environment. Although we would assume that these individual efforts would result in positive changes at the school level, we would need school-level data in order to specifically examine whether the training had an effect on the school environment. Even though this evaluation did not assess school-level effects, some training participants reported that the changes they made as a result of the training directly led to a decrease in students’ use of anti-LGBTQ language. However, other participants reported that they did not think they could change the school environment by themselves. They indicated that they needed the involvement of more school personnel in order to make a real difference in their school. They specifically recommended that other school staff, and especially school administrators, receive the training. The training was not designed for school administrators, and therefore, very few principals or other school personnel with the authority to make changes with school-wide impact attended the training. In order to have a substantive effect on the school environment, trainings about combating anti-LGBTQ bias and creating safe schools for LGBTQ students should be provided, not just to teachers or counselors, but to all school staff, including nurses, safety officers, and, particularly, administrators. Findings from this evaluation indicate that providing training to school staff can be a vital tool for improving school climate not only for LGBTQ students, but for all members of the school community. Unfortunately, most of our nation’s schools have not yet provided professional development on LGBTQ issues for their staff.8 It is imperative that school leaders, district administrators, and pre-service educator training programs implement training programs for educators, such as the New York City Department of Education’s Respect for All program. Policymakers, 8  GLSEN and Harris Interactive (2008). The Principal’s Perspective: School Safety, Bullying and Harassment, A Survey of Public School Principals. New York: GLSEN.19Year One Evaluation of the Respect for All Training Programsafe school supporters, and anyone interested in ensuring equal education opportunities for all students should advocate for comprehensive training for school staff on LGBTQ issues. Of course, educator trainings should be one part of a larger effort to ensure safe and respectful schools that includes: support of student clubs that address LGBTQ issues; access to appropriate and accurate information about LGBT people, history, and events through curriculum and library and Internet resources; and policies that specifically prohibit bullying or harassment based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. Taken together, such measures can move us towards a future where schools are safe and welcoming for all students, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network 90 Broad Street 2nd Floor New York, NY 10004 www.glsen.org",

    "abstract": "The GLSEN Research Department conducted an evaluation of the New York City Department of Education's (NYC DOE) Respect for All training program for secondary school educators. The two-day training program, which was one component of the NYC DOE's Respect for All initiative, was implemented so that every secondary school in the district had at least one staff member who could support lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) students and combat all forms of bias-based bullying and harassment, particularly bias based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.In order to evaluate Year One of the training program, GLSEN surveyed 813 educators who participated in the training at three times -- before the training, six weeks after, and six months after. Training participants were also compared to educators who had not yet completed the training. Focus groups were conducted in order to gain a greater, in-depth understanding of participants' experiences in the training. Key findings are listed below.Compared to before the training, after the training educators demonstrated increased:Knowledge of appropriate terms;Access to LGBTQ-related resources;Awareness of how their own practices might have been harmful to LGBTQ students;Empathy for LGBTQ students;Belief in the importance of intervening in anti-LGBTQ remarks;Communication with students and staff about LGBTQ issues;Engagement in activities to create safer schools for LGBTQ students (i.e., supporting Gay-Straight Alliances, including LGBTQ content in curriculum); andFrequency of intervention in anti-LGBTQ name-calling, bullying, and harassment.In addition, compared to educators who had not yet participated in the training, those who had participated in the training indicated higher levels of:Communication with students and staff about LGBTQ issues; andEngagement in activities to create safer schools for LGBTQ students.Findings from the Year One evaluation demonstrate that this training program is an effective means for developing the competency of educators to address bias-based bullying and harassment, and to create safer school environments for LGBTQ students. The findings suggest that providing such training to all school staff, including administrators, would result in an even stronger effect on the school environment. Furthermore, ensuring sufficient opportunities for developing educators' skills in intervening in anti-LGBTQ behaviors could enhance the effectiveness of trainings. To maintain the benefits of training, staff should receive continued and advanced professional development opportunities related to supporting LGBTQ students and combating bias-based bullying and harassment",
