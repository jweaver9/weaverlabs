Summary\nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction \nIn 2010, ARL published SPEC Kit 319 Diversity Plans and Programs, which provided a glimpse into \nthe progress ARL member libraries had made to recruit and retain a diverse workforce since 1990 and \nexplored the existence and content of diversity plans and programs. The results of that SPEC survey, \nwhen compared with the results of the 1990 surveys for SPEC Kit 165 Cultural Diversity Programming \nin ARL Libraries and SPEC Kit 167 Minority Recruitment and Retention in ARL Libraries, showed that \nlibrary activities in this area have been constantly in flux. Many of the libraries that responded to those \nsurveys were leaders in the field of diversity and the three documents provide a wealth of information \nabout library programs and services, recruitment and retention, and managing and retaining a \ndiverse workforce.\nToday, diversity is defined beyond racial and ethnic groups and includes gender, sexual \norientation, ability, language, religious belief, national origin, age, and ideas. The increase of published \nliterature about cultural competencies, microaggressions, and assessment of diversity issues, as well as \nthe inclusion of social justice movements in libraries, suggests diversity-related activities have increased \nand evolved over the last seven years. Over this time span, several libraries have obtained funding \nto support strategies to increase the number of minority librarians on their staff and support their \nadvancement within the organization. There also appears to be an increase in the number of diversity \nor multicultural groups at the local, state, and national levels. However, these changes have not been \nconsistently documented. Therefore, it is important to re-examine this topic to evaluate the impact of \nevolving endeavors, to see if more ARL libraries are involved, to see how diversity plans have changed \nover the years, and to document the current practices of research libraries.\nThe main purpose of this survey was to identify diversity trends and changes in managing \ndiversity issues in ARL libraries through exploring the components of diversity plans and initiatives since \n2010, acknowledge library efforts since the 1990s, provide evidence of best practices and future trends, \nand identify current strategies that increase the number of minority librarians in research libraries and \nthe types of programs that foster a diverse workplace and climate. The survey was conducted between \nMay 1 and June 5, 2017. Sixty-eight of the 124 ARL member institutions responded to the survey for a \n55% response rate. Interestingly, only 22 of the respondents to the 2010 SPEC survey participated in \nthis survey, but this provides an opportunity to explore the diversity and inclusion efforts of a new set of \ninstitutions in addition to seeing what changes those 22 institutions have made since 2010.\n3SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nDiversity/Inclusion Plans \nA diversity/inclusion plan may include a statement of diversity values or goals for the library, a \ndescription of strategies for recruiting ethnically/culturally diverse staff to the library and retaining them \nonce they are hired, an outline of programs that promote ethnic/cultural sensitivity in the workplace, \nresults from a workplace climate assessment, and other similar elements. It may be a stand-alone \ndocument or part of a broader document, such as a library strategic plan or an institution-wide diversity \ndocument. Similar to the 2010 survey, 36 of the responding libraries (53%) reported they have a diversity \nplan as described above; an additional 14 (21%) have a plan currently under development or review. The \nmajority of plans are separate documents spread throughout the institution that, when joined together, \nform what can be defined as a diversity/inclusion plan. Several other respondents mentioned they do not \nhave specific plans but that statements on diversity and inclusion are included in library strategic plans \nand in the library committee structure. Elements of the diversity plan remain the same, however newer \nelements such as climate survey, measuring success,  and information about accountability are included.\nThe majority of respondents who have a plan reported that their library administration was \nresponsible for initiating its development (24 or 67%). At seven of those libraries (19%) the library \nhuman resources officer/unit also played a role. Forty-one respondents (87%) reported that diversity \ninitiatives or directives from their parent institution had an impact on the library plan. Survey \nrespondents’ comments suggest that outside factors such as social justice movements and the creation \nof campus offices for diversity and inclusion were the main drivers of these changes, as were campus \nleaders invested in diversity and inclusion leadership positions and departments. One respondent \nmentioned that the development of their plan was “truly a grassroots effort by staff that was supported \nby administration.”\nA closer look at the diversity plans initiated by parent institutions reveals that some are a part \nof the campus strategic planning document that outlines specific initiatives and includes components of \nresponsibility and accountability. Some of the examples are statements about diversity & inclusion from \nhigh-level campus administration such as the provost, chancellor, or president. Other institutions have  \nprovided training on implicit bias, conducted a climate survey, or appointed committees and charged \ngroups to work in this area. There is a clear increase in the ways libraries and campuses are looking at and \napproaching these issues.\nOne significant change since 2010 is the number of libraries that review their plans annually and \nbiannually; 24 of 34 responding libraries reported their diversity and inclusion plans were updated as \nrecently as 2015 or are currently being evaluated. While 18 respondents stated their plans are components \nof the strategic planning process in the libraries or in the parent organization, more than half of the \ndiversity plans (24 or 57%) were reported as stand-alone documents.\nAn important aspect of having a plan is the ability to implement it, including staff to plan and \ndeliver programming and training in support of those efforts. In 2010, 36 respondents reported a total of \nthree multicultural librarians and seven diversity officers. Responses to the 2017 survey show an increase: \nseven libraries report having a multicultural/diversity librarian and 20 have diversity officers. Currently, \nimplementation of diversity and inclusion plans falls primarily on diversity committees or other related \ngroups (32 of 42 respondents or 76%), HR/personnel officers (27 or 64%), or diversity officers (15 or 36%). \nSeveral reported that library administrators also play a role. One respondent reported, “The Libraries \nmade it a requirement for all faculty and staff to have a diversity commitment statement in their position \ndescription.” This sentiment is shared by other libraries who also reported that the responsibility for \ndiversity and inclusion falls on all members of the organization.\n                       \n4 Survey Results: Executive Summary\nFunding Strategies \nResponses to a question about whether the library has dedicated funding to support diversity/inclusion \nefforts were split fairly evenly between libraries who reported they do (35 or 52%) and those who do \nnot (32 or 48%). Thirty-four of the respondents who have dedicated funding said the source is the \ngeneral library budget. Twelve of these also receive support from the parent institution. Eight libraries \nsupplement their primary funding with federal, state, and/or private grants. One receives funding solely \nfrom the parent institution. Several respondents commented that the dean has a discretionary fund \nfrom which resources can be requested. The majority of respondents reported that funding supports \nprofessional development, workshops, program development, leadership development, recruitment \nefforts, and travel. Comments about other activities reflect support for residency programs that increase \nthe number of diverse staff. At 16 libraries the level of funding has increased over the last five years; at 17 \nit has stayed about the same. Only two respondents said that funding has decreased.\nPrograms to Promote an Inclusive Workplace\nThe majority of respondents use a variety of staff development strategies to promote an inclusive \nworkplace. These include presentations, workshops, programs, and exhibits, as well as specialized efforts \nthat focus on adding diverse general, special, and online resources to library collections. Examples of \nthese efforts include training on conflict management, implicit bias, microaggressions, cultural and \ngender identity, and safe zones; book talks and poster sessions; exhibits for K–8 students; and travel \nsupport for diversity conferences.\nThese efforts are planned and delivered by a wide variety of individuals and groups, most \noften by a library diversity committee or similar group and/or a personnel officer. Forty-four libraries \nresponded that other individuals and/or groups are also involved with planning or delivering diversity \nprograms, including departments, units, other committees and working groups, branch libraries, subject \nspecialists, and museum staff. Widespread programming is taking place at the staff, librarian, and library \nadministration levels. Collaborations with campus partners and community activists also strengthen \nthe types of programs offered. Almost all of the responding libraries are taking advantage of training \nopportunities provided by the parent institution and many send staff to training provided by professional \norganizations such as ALA, ACRL, and ARL.\nWhen asked about use of the 2012 ACRL Diversity Standards, 50 respondents (77%) reported \nthey have not used them in any way. Those who had, mostly used them as a reference in the creation of \ntheir own institution’s diversity plan.\nRecruitment Strategies \nAll but seven of the 68 responding libraries have or plan to develop recruitment strategies to increase \nethnically/culturally diverse applicant pools. Many of the strategies are not new, but the most successful \nones include training search committee members on how to develop a diverse candidate pool, targeting \njob ads to participants of diversity enhancement recruitment programs such as ARL’s Initiative to Recruit \na Diverse Workforce (IRDW) and ALA’s Spectrum Scholars program, offering a post-LIS residency \nprogram, and supporting ARL initiatives that attract librarians from racially and ethnically diverse groups \nto the profession.\nThere is about an equal split between libraries that feel their strategies have led to pools that are \nmore inclusive (53% ) and those that do not (47%). Comments revealed there is little data to support these \nfeelings because the information either isn’t tracked or lies in the hands of the parent institute and is not \nshared with library search committees. One respondent noted that the diversity of their pools increased \nafter implementing an initiative that gives applicants extra credit for military service, since “veterans tend \nto be a diverse group.”\n5SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nReal and perceived barriers to recruitment were reported by a majority of the respondents (37 or \n63%), a number that has increased since 2010. The most common barriers continue to be related to the \nlibrary’s geographic location and the reputation of the city, state, or university as not welcoming diverse \nindividuals. Others mentioned the small pools of diverse candidates in LIS programs and implicit bias \nof search committees or managers. These are very similar to the challenges expressed by respondents \nto the survey for SPEC Kit 319. Libraries are trying to overcome these barriers by adding more inclusive \nstatements to their job announcement, direct contact with diverse candidates,  and providing implicit bias \ntraining to search committees.\nRetention Programs \nGoing hand in hand with recruitment is retention of staff. Forty-eight of the responding libraries \n(71%) have developed strategies for retaining a diverse group of employees. The most used strategies \nare onboarding/orientation programs for new staff, leadership development and training, mentoring \nprograms to help librarians attain advancement and/or tenure, and supporting membership in or \nengagement with parent institution diversity affinity groups or ALA ethnic caucuses. Other strategies \nrevealed in the comments are the development of writing groups for all of the faculty, travel funds for all \nlibrary personnel, personal involvement and advocacy by library leadership, and library administrators \nwho actively work to ensure a positive work culture. Two respondents commented that their library has \nbecome a member of the ACRL Diversity Alliance. Of these options, leadership development, mentoring, \nsupporting engagement with parent institution groups, and residency programs have been the most \nsuccessful. One commenter summed up their experience with retention success: “having a diverse staff \nhelps retain a diverse staff.”\nTen respondents reported that the library has made changes that have improved retention \noutcomes. Examples include developing or redesigning a residency program, requiring that all new \nstaff attend the orientation program, supporting writing groups, and having all staff identify diversity \nlearning goals during the annual performance review process. Still, about half of the respondents have \nencountered obstacles to retaining a diverse group of employees. Through exit interviews some libraries \nlearned that librarians left institutions because of limited advancement options, the lack of connection \nwith staff, and the culture of the university. The lack of diversity in the local community is also an issue. \nOthers report that salaries aren’t competitive or they haven’t even had the funds to fill vacancies. More \nrecently, the political climate in certain states is perceived to have negatively impacted the retention of \ndiverse library staff.\nEvaluation & Assessment\nEvaluation and assessment of recruitment and retention efforts continue to challenge the majority of \nlibraries. Only ten respondents have developed ways to measure recruitment success in their libraries. \nAnother 25 plan to develop such measures in the future. Eight libraries measure the success of their \nretention efforts and 20 others plan to. Workplace climate assessment is more common, though, perhaps \nbecause survey tools already exist. Forty-six libraries (68%) have assessed their workplace climate and \nan additional 12 (8%) are planning to. Twenty-four (48%) have or will use surveys developed by their \nparent institution.  Nineteen (38%) have or will use surveys developed by the library and 19 libraries use \nthe ClimateQUAL™ survey. Ten libraries have used multiple surveys to gage their climate. Since these \nefforts are not yet well established, it is not surprising that only 19 libraries have used assessment results \nto change their diversity plan and/or programming, though 60 respondents described recent changes to \ntheir diversity/inclusion initiatives.\n6 Survey Results: Executive Summary\nDiversity & Inclusion Engagement\nOver the last five years, changes in the national political climate, as well as changes in campus and library \nleadership, have greatly influenced and heightened awareness of diversity and inclusion activities at \nsurvey respondents’ institutions. Many stated that the quantity and depth of diversity activities and \ntrainings have increased, including increased engagement by more faculty and staff so “diversity and \ninclusion is woven into the fabric of all we do and less as stand-alone initiatives.” The development \nof strategic plans—both at the campus and library level—with built-in support services has also \nenabled libraries to respond to social justice movements in a variety of ways, from hosting exhibits, \nproviding space for peaceful gathering, and partnering with campus cultural affinity groups to formal \ninclusion statements and moves to de-name/rename buildings. Several respondents also mentioned the \ntransformation of gendered restrooms into gender-neutral restrooms.\nRecommendations and Conclusion\nIn the seven years since SPEC Kit 319 surveyed ARL member libraries on their diversity plans and \nprograms, they have made strides to create more diverse and inclusive workplaces by developing both \nlibrary and institution-level diversity committees, teams, and task forces, diversity officer positions, and \nspecific diversity and inclusion plans. While it is clear that ARL libraries have expanded their definition \nand scope of diversity and the methods they use to support marginalized groups, there is more to be done, \nnot only at an institutional level but in the profession as a whole.\nRecruiting librarians from underrepresented groups to the profession has to begin with LIS \neducation. Innovative approaches that fund opportunities in archives, music, and other internships \nare attracting undergraduate students who may become interested in a library career. Changes to the \ngraduate-level LIS curriculum that incorporate cultural competencies and social justice issues can \nensure students will learn how best to serve diverse communities through collections, programs, and \nservices. For example, Jaeger and his colleagues (2015) have been successful in developing the “virtuous \ncircle” of educating LIS faculty and students to be compassionate and culturally responsive to the needs \nof the community, therefore recruiting other individuals who share their values into the profession. \nCooke (2017) has incorporated discussions and projects into her classes that challenge the students to be \nresponsive to and value the communities they may work in and desire to serve.\nLIS students have also organized diversity initiatives on their campuses. For example, the \niDiversity group at the University of Maryland was organized in 2012 to promote cultural competency \nwithin the institution and the profession at large (Oxley 2016). In response to call for a greater sense \nof community amongst graduate students of color at the Simmons School of Library and Information \nSciences, Students of Color at SLIS was founded in 2015 to build and sustain a supportive community \nto contribute to their academic development, social growth, and well being. Spectra was formed to \nbring together individuals who share an interest in issues that surround the LGBTQ community in the \nprofession of library science. In 2016, DERAIL (Diversity, Equity, Race, Accessibility, and Identity in LIS), \na student-initiated forum for students to engage in meaningful conversations about critical approaches \nto librarianship, archives, children’s literature, cultural heritage institutions, and museums, held its first \nforum. (Simmons College n.d.)\nLibraries must continue to fund and implement library programs that research and experience \nshow really work: mentoring, residency programs, professional development, affinity groups, and staff \ntraining. Damasco and Hodges’ research (2012) about the tenure and promotion experiences of academic \nlibrarians identified obstacles and effective initiatives in achieving success. Their results reinforce the \nneed for informal and formal mentoring, professional development programs, and affinity or peer support \ngroups for successful advancement. The results of this SPEC survey also show that mentoring programs, \nboth formal and informal, are successful in retaining a diverse workforce, but are still slow in developing.\n7SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nPlacing early and mid-career librarians in positions where they can hone their skills and gain \nexperiences for future positions is also beneficial. Boyd, et al. (2017 ) surveyed active and inactive \nresidency coordinators and residents to evaluate academic library residency programs for librarians of \ncolor. Their research found those programs provide skills and experiences for beginning career librarians \nand are evidence of organizational effectiveness. The ACRL Diversity Alliance has attracted 33 libraries, \nincluding ARL members, that will continue “to increase the pipeline of professionally underrepresented \nracial and ethnic groups” by creating one or more residency positions that last two to three years. Since \n1997, 150 mid-career librarians from traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups \nhave participated in the ARL Leadership and Career Development Program (LCDP). When Washington-\nHoagland and Puente (2016) surveyed LCDP alumni to assess the impact of the program, she found that \n76% experienced an advance in their position during or soon after their 18-month fellowship.\nIn 2015, Alabi designed a survey, open to all academic librarians, to identify racial \nmicroaggressions witnessed by majority librarians or experienced by librarians of color. Alabi’s research \nexposed the subtle statements, actions, and nonverbals that disrespect individual library patrons and staff. \nIncreased awareness of these hidden nonverbal behaviors and actions, as well as implicit bias, privilege, \netc., compels libraries to train staff because unchecked behaviors negatively influence workplace climate.\nWith the evolution of social media and networking, the landscape is more engaging and proactive \nin changing expectations about discovery of diversity and inclusion tools. New conferences, innovative \nproject, rallying points, and strategic directions have been unlocked across the nation and around \nthe world. Social network-connected librarians are ready to make a difference in their organizations. \nFor example, April Hathcock (2015) published her article about white privilege and the effectiveness \nof diversity and inclusion efforts in the open access journal In the Library with the Lead Pipe. Within \nhours, and for several weeks, librarians joined the scholarly discourse by adding their thoughts on and \nexperiences with the effectiveness of diversity and inclusion initiatives.\nIn the new and revived era of social movements and rallies, there is a need for more \nconversations, openness, and understanding about diversity, inclusion, equity, and privilege. To fully \nencompass the various levels of social identities, efforts have evolved beyond just the racial and ethnic \ndiversity demonstrated by the varied efforts reported in this survey. Political climate has also fueled the \ndiscourse about equity and privilege through grassroot efforts. Persistence has led the charge to stay \nengaged and vocal about the efforts of unrepresented and underrepresented librarians.\nOngoing assessment is needed to evaluate and measure the success both of programs \nand individuals in diversity-focused positions. Libraries have access to assessment tools such as \nClimateQUAL™ and the Balanced Scorecard that were designed to measure success within institutional \nstrategic planning goals. With recent changes in implementing diversity and inclusion at the parent \ninstitution level, they may need to draw on the strengths of consultants to determine successful efforts \nand help them develop effective assessment and evaluation tools.\nIn conclusion, research institutions are cultivating learning environments that are inclusive of all \nof the attributes that make us different and unique. Libraries are at the center of these institutions and are \ndemonstrating their value through their engagement in research and instruction, collections, and learning \nspaces. Diversity and inclusion themes permeate all of these areas. There is evidence that some libraries \nare incorporating their values for inclusion at all levels. While inclusive practice supports the diverse \nindividual to be themselves and be perceived as valued in the organization, moving to the next level is \nvital to avoid the exclusion of these individuals in the everyday rituals in the workplace, which impacts \nclimate issues and retention. (Mor Barak 2015; Shore, et al. 2017)\n8 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nSurvey Questions and \nResponses\nThe SPEC Survey on Diversity and Inclusion was designed by Toni Anaya, Instruction Coordinator, and \nCharlene Maxey-Harris, Research and Instructional Services Chair, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. \nThese results are based on responses from 68 of the 124 ARL member libraries (55%) by the deadline of \nJune 12, 2017. The survey’s introductory text and questions are reproduced below, followed by the response \ndata and selected comments from the respondents.\nSince the SPEC survey program began in the early 1970s, at least six surveys have investigated how \nresearch libraries responded to affirmative action initiatives, recruited minorities, and, more recently, \nattempted to build an inclusive workforce that reflects the broad diversity of their communities. \nThe resulting SPEC Kits provide a wealth of information about library hiring programs and services, \nrecruitment and retention strategies, and efforts to foster diversity with the workforce. They also show \nthat the issues have been in constant flux. While the focus of earlier surveys was on how successful \nlibraries have been in recruiting and retaining librarians of color, the characteristics of diversity now \nextend beyond racial and ethnic groups to include gender, sexual orientation, ability, language, religious \nbelief, national origin, age, and ideas.\nThe increase of published literature about cultural competencies, microaggressions, and assessment of \ndiversity issues, as well as the inclusion of social justice movements in libraries, suggests diversity-related \nactivities have increased and evolved since 2010, when ARL published SPEC Kit 319 Diversity Plans \nand Programs. During the last seven years, several libraries have obtained funding to support strategies \nto increase the number of minority librarians on their staff and support their advancement within the \norganization. There also appears to be an increase in the number of diversity and inclusion or social \njustice committees, task forces, and project teams at the local, state, and national levels. In addition, \nlibraries and archives are evaluating the extent to which collection development strategies, exhibitions, \ndescriptive practices, student and community outreach activities, and other activity can support the \ncreation of inclusive environments. However, these changes have not been consistently documented. \nTherefore, it is important to re-examine research libraries’ efforts to create a more representative \nworkforce and inclusive work environment.\nThe purpose of this survey is to explore the components of diversity plans created since 2010, identify \ncurrent recruitment and retention strategies that aim to increase the number of minority librarians \nin research libraries, identify staff development programs that foster an inclusive workplace and \nclimate, identify how diversity programs have changed, and gather information on how libraries assess \nthese efforts. \n9SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nDIVERSITY PLAN\nA diversity/inclusion plan may include a statement of diversity values or goals for the library, a \ndescription of strategies for recruiting diverse staff from historically underrepresented or marginalized \ngroups to the library and retaining them once they are hired, an outline of programs that promote ethnic/\ncultural sensitivity in the workplace, results from a work climate assessment, and similar elements. It \nmay be a stand-alone document or part of a broader document, such as a library strategic plan or an \ninstitution-wide diversity document.\n1. Does your library have a diversity/inclusion plan as described above? N=68\nYes 36 53%\nNot yet, but one is being developed 14 21%\nNo 18 27%\nComments N=24\nAnswered Yes N=14\nDiversity and inclusion is represented in the library’s committee structure and in the strategic plan.\nEach year, an overview of the accomplishments from our plan are reflected on our website. \nHas not been formally updated since 2010. \nHere is ours: The UC San Diego Library is committed to nurturing and maintaining a supportive and \ninclusive environment in which diversity and fairness are valued and respected. This commitment \nbuilds on the UC San Diego Principles of Community, reaffirmed regularly by the Chancellor, which \nprovide a framework for diversity, fairness, and inclusion on campus and place a high value on the \nunique contributions of each member of the UC San Diego community. The Library Diversity & \nInclusion Committee works to build, foster, and maintain a climate that respects: equal access and \nparticipation of all groups and individuals, regardless of their culture, race, ethnicity, gender, age, \nreligion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or geographic origin. \nTo accomplish this, the committee members collaborate with Library staff, students, and campus \npartners to develop, advise, and implement various programs and processes. The Library Diversity \n& Inclusion Committee activities include: Working with members of the Library Administration \nand Library Council to articulate the Library’s expectations of its staff for cultural competence, in \nkeeping with the University of California Diversity Statement (University of California Diversity \nStatement); Working with the Library’s Training Coordinator to provide diversity-related educational \nopportunities for Library staff; Creating opportunities and venues for discussion of diversity/equity \nissues within the Library; Advising Library Administration and Library Council members on policy \nissues related to diversity and inclusion; Forming partnerships and sharing information and best \npractices with relevant groups on campus, including the Diversity Council, student groups, and others \nas appropriate; Collaborating with various Library programs to support and celebrate diversity and \ninclusion activities.\nOur statement: The University of Texas Libraries welcomes and respects all individuals and \ncommunities by valuing and consciously maintaining awareness of diverse perspectives and \nexperiences. We believe inclusivity is critical to fostering excellence in all of our endeavors, and we \npromote diversity in our collections and the services that we provide as well as in our recruiting, hiring \nand retention practices. \nOur university has an institution-wide document. \n10 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nPrepared at the request of a campus-wide diversity initiative.\nThe University Library has a diversity strategic plan. The initial plan was formulated in 2011 and \nhas been revised twice since then. The strategic goals have also been incorporated into the library’s \nstrategic initiatives.\nThese are separate documents, not a cohesive diversity plan. They include a library staff vision plan, the \nlibrary strategic plan, and inclusion statement.\nUniversity-wide series of documents\nWe do not have a single document as described, but we do have most of the elements in place.\nWe had a Diversity Task Force who put together a report and recommendations. We now have an \nEquity and Diversity Committee and subcommittees implementing the recommendations of the task \nforce. One of the subcommittees of the EDC is a Strategic Diversity Task Force, which will look at \nbuilding an ongoing plan. \nWe have a plan that is part of our Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) workgroup and one that is part \nof our libraries’ strategic priorities and an overarching plan set forth by the university. \nWe have had one for five years. In the process of updating and rewriting.\nAnswered Not Yet N=5\nA statement about a commitment to diversity is included in the library’s strategic plan. \nDraft plan created in 2005 but wasn’t formalized; we are looking to develop a new one.\nPreliminary document is under review.\nWe have an older plan that has not been updated substantially since 2008 or 2009. A 2012 revision of \nthe libraries’ strategic plan also provides direction for diversity efforts. \nWhile we have a diversity committee and our libraries’ strategic plan includes commitment to diversity, \nwe do not have an articulated diversity inclusion plan.\nAnswered No N=5\nOur most recent strategic plan for the University Libraries (2016–2019) includes a paragraph of \ncontinuing education for employees, including “education that advances the development of an \ninclusive and diverse community.” Our parent institution has a diversity strategic plan (2013–2018) \nand a general strategic plan with a goal to “foster a diverse and inclusive community that supports \nmutual respect.” This work is primarily reflected in the charter of the University Libraries Diversity \nCouncil, a standing group that reports to the dean of libraries. Beyond “fostering a diverse and inclusive \ncommunity,” none of our guiding documents outline specific plans, goals, or programs for this work.\nThe Libraries has an affirmative action plan, which is administered by the university’s Office of \nInstitutional Equity and Diversity (OIED). The university has recently appointed a new vice provost for \nthis area who will likely develop a broader plan, at which time the Libraries will participate. \nThere are pieces of plan spread across the strategic plan, our ClimateQUAL survey and results, and \nuniversity diversity/inclusion statements. \nThis idea is under consideration for development, but it’s not yet an active plan.\nUntil 2015, each university unit prepared a document titled “A Framework to Foster Diversity” similar \nto what is described above. In 2015 a university-wide decision to integrate diversity planning into \nstrategic planning was made reflecting our value that diversity is not a stand-alone item, but relates to \neverything we do.\n11SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nDIVERSITY PLAN DETAILS\nIf the library is developing a diversity/inclusion plan, please answer as many of the following questions as \npossible at this time.\n2.

In the last five years, has your parent institution developed diversity initiatives or issued \ndirectives that have impacted your library diversity plan? N=47\nYes 41 87% \nNo 6 13% \nIf yes, please briefly describe those initiatives/directives and how they impacted the library plan. \nN=38\nA new strategic plan was developed that specifically included diversity initiatives. \nCampus created a Diversity Framework, which included framework goals. They then created a R.E.E.L \nchange model (Retain, Equip, Engage, Lead). The library used these documents when creating the \nDiversity Task Force document and recommendations.\nChallenging each college and department to further diversity and inclusion on our campus and \ncollaborate with other colleges and departments to do so.\n12 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nCreated a Chief Diversity Officer to coordinate activities.\nCreation of Office of Diversity and Inclusion; increase in level of programming at the university has \nprovided more resources for workshops/trainings; will impact recruitment process.\nDiversity and equity are fundamental to the university as set out in diversity statements, policies, and \nguidelines. These include: President’s Statement on Diversity and Inclusion and Statement on Equity, \nDiversity, and Excellence.\nEmployment equity funding, and equity census, and positive space initiatives through the university’s \nEquity and Inclusion Office\nFounded in 2014, a group of staff committed to researching, discussing, and advocating around \nthe relationship of diversity and justice, with a focus on race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual \norientation, dis/ability, socioeconomic class, and national identity, to our workplace environment, \nincluding: diversity in hiring, retention, and promotion; diversity in service with our campus and city \ncommunities; and diversity in the library professions. \nGender-neutral washrooms, inclusion in recruiting, general awareness panels, and presentations\nImplicit bias training for all searches; diversity hiring initiatives\nIn 2014, the university created an Office of Equity and Inclusion (OEI) and hired a new director to focus \nin this area. The OEI has several programs that serve under-represented/protected groups. In addition, \na formal advisory group related to diversity & inclusion exists as part of the university’s senate. The \nlibrary’s plan involves collaboration and engagement with these entities. \nIn fall of 2015, the university embarked on a comprehensive effort to craft a strategic plan for diversity, \nequity, and inclusive excellence. All campus administrative units and departments participated in \ndefining inclusive excellence for their unit/department and developed an inclusive excellence plan.\nIncreased emphasis on recruiting for diversity has impacted our recruitment efforts.\nLast year, two of our Black student groups submitted a list of actions they recommended the Institute \ntake; one of them was a request for every department to articulate a statement that describes its \ncommitment to diversity. The Libraries was the first unit on campus to write and publish such a \nstatement. More generally, the Institute Community and Equity Office was created, with a mission to \n“advance a respectful and caring community that embraces diversity and empowers everyone to learn \nand do their best at MIT.” The newly created position of Libraries’ Director of Community Support and \nStaff Development is in part intended to lead our efforts to contribute to ICEO and related initiatives \non campus.\nLibrary Diversity and Inclusion Plan touched on increasing diversity and inclusion of collections, \nservices, staffing. Library Inclusion Committee has been formed to address action items \nand deliverables.\nLibrary diversity initiatives and programs are designed to align with at least one of the 6 guiding \nprinciples in the document, Inclusive Excellence: An Action Plan for Diversity.\nNew university strategic plan. Equity Advisors for each college and Departmental Enhancement \nProgram (ADVANCE). Creation of D&I office.\nObjectives of the Flagship 2020 include “Increase diversity among faculty, staff, and students”; \n“Increase the number of students who work with or live in diverse communities”; and “Expand \nsupportive communities for minority, international, and first generation students”. Each academic and \nsupport unit at LSU has been asked to use the framework of the Flagship 2020 Agenda to inform their \nown strategic plans. The main components of the Libraries Diversity Committee charge that align with \nthe Flagship 2020 objectives include: (1) foster a positive attitude toward diversity and inclusion within \n13SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nthe Libraries; (2) to assist search committees in the recruitment of a diverse pool of candidates for \npositions at the Libraries; (3) to establish and maintain a welcoming and respectful environment for all \nlibrary employees and patrons. \nOne of our core values is to foster a work environment that is free from discrimination and promotes \nequal, fair, and inclusive employment opportunities for the best and brightest talent available regardless \nof their difference.\nOur parent institution has been developing diversity initiatives for a long time. However, in the past few \nyears there have been a great number of initiatives focused on various aspects of diversity. \nParent institution has hired university diversity officer, required each school/college to appoint a \ndiversity officer. Created a Council of Academic Diversity Officers and University Diversity Committee. \nEach group has initiatives and goals.\nPractices are embedded in the university’s workforce management hiring and recruitment workflow.\nSet broad targets for % of minority in each job category across the university.\nThe focus of the university’s plan has not changed in recent years, but the standards and approach for \ndemonstrating progress have been changing. \nThe Inclusion, Diversity, and Equal Opportunity serves as a resource to the university in the \ninterpretation, understanding, and application of federal and state equal opportunity and affirmative \naction laws and regulations. Ultimately, the office supports the university’s mission by providing \nstrategic leadership in the development of policies, procedures, and programs that will help foster \ndiversity, inclusiveness, and a welcoming environment for faculty, staff, students, and others. The \nlibrary has followed the new office and began adapting HR policies to reflect these changes.\nThe library plan was created at the request of the campus diversity initiative.\nThe Netter Center, Greenfield Intercultural Center, Women’s Center, and various other centers, \nstudent-led committees, administrative efforts have all led to collaborations and institution-wide \ninitiatives that have propelled our diversity efforts. \nThe parent institution of the Library of Congress is of course the United States Congress. The Library \nof Congress is responsive to congressional legislation. In addition, the Library of Congress implemented \nits Multi-Year Affirmative Employment Program Plan from 2011 through 2016. \nThe primary directive that impacts the Libraries’ plan was that the president now includes a diversity \nand inclusion initiatives section in the annual report from all deans, department heads, associate \nprovosts, VPs, etc. This actually assists us in ensuring that our goals/initiatives are executed.\nThe university began a campus wide Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion campaign in 2015. This included a \nrequirement that all units, schools, and colleges develop their own diversity plan. \nThe university has an office of Multicultural & Diversity Affairs that is housed with the Division of \nStudent Affairs. The mission is to lead efforts in social justice and inclusion. The Libraries’ Strategic \nDirections 2014–2017 include statements about he promoting both external and internal efforts to \nsupport the diverse university community.\nThe university has diversity as a strategic initiative. The university has a diversity counsel. \nThe university launched a diversity strategic planning initiative in 2009. After the resulting Diversity \nStrategic Plan 2012, each major academic and administrative unit appointed a diversity officer, \nestablished a committee, and developed a related diversity strategic plan. The Diversity Department \nCommittee chairs convene monthly for a meeting led by the Vice Provost for Diversity and Senior \nAdvisor to the Chancellor and Office of Diversity staff.\n14 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nThe university provided a set of principles, initiatives, and guidelines for hiring and retention as well as \nmulticultural training for staff.\nThe university recently welcomed a new Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion. Some \nrecent initiatives of her appointment have been the addition of diversity training on campus, re-\nevaluating diversity requirements for recruitment, and adding a diversity section to our annual staff \nengagement survey.\nThe university’s institutional diversity planning initiative requires each unit, including the library, to \nput forth 3–5 new initiatives each year to promote diversity and inclusion. \nThe university’s Office of Diversity and Equity and the chancellor have diversity statements. The \nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) advisory group wrote a report, which includes specific action \nsteps towards DEI on campus. The Campus Climate Survey results were published on March 27. These \ninitiatives have influenced the creation of a goal specific to DEI in the Libraries’ upcoming two-year \ndirective and the creation of a DEI committee. \nThe university’s strategic plan for diversity instituted a framework that called for the hiring of a Chief \nDiversity Officer and appointment of a Diversity Officer charged with leading their college, school, \nor division in developing specific unit goals and initiatives/programs. Each college unit’s Diversity \nOfficer submits an annual report/update on the progress towards achieving unit goals and initiatives/\nprograms and any new goals/strategies. \n4.

N=19\nACRL Diversity Alliance\nAdded diversity statement to librarian recruitment process.\nAs part of our recruiting efforts for our post-LIS residency program, we have visited the LIS program \nat an HBCU. When visiting other library schools, we have contacted affinity groups at those schools to \nspecifically target students from underrepresented groups.\nDirectly invite diverse candidates to apply for positions.\nEncourage diversity in selection of search committees.\nFinancial support is provided through tuition remission for all employees of the university system. \n(University of Nebraska-Omaha provides the LIS program through the University of Missouri.)\nHR has redacted names and any personal information from candidate resumes and applications so that \nreviews and selections will be more objective and based more on skills and qualifications.\nIn 2014, university administration adopted a recommendation from the Diversity Council to add a \nstatement to further the goal of recruiting more diverse faculty. This is required and the UL complies. \nJointed the ACRL Diversity Alliance and have created a resident librarian position. \n36 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nRecruiting early career librarians (rather than requiring the standard 3–5 years experience) allows the \nmost diverse applicant pools.\nRecruiting in venues that attract diverse audiences.\nTarget job ads to be distributed on ethnic caucus and other related listservs such as APALA, BCALA, \nACRL Residency Interest Group, etc.\nTargeting specific listservs and job boards, highlighting diversity on website, diversity statement in \npostings, direct person-to-person recruitment efforts.\nThe library participated very successfully in the CIRLA (Chesapeake Information and Research \nLibrary Alliance) post-LIS fellowships that concluded several years ago. Several CIRLA Fellows \ngained permanent jobs at the library and at least one, a member of a minority group, has moved into \nmanagement here.\nThrough personal invitation to apply for positions within the libraries.\nWe are piloting a residency program beginning FY2018.\nWe have been experimenting with redacting different information from resumes in the initial stages \nof review.\nWe recently revised our position advertisements to include expanded, explicit statements about the \nvalue we place on diversity, and inviting candidates who identify as being from underrepresented \ngroups to apply.\nWe target diverse organizations and listservs.\n21. Have applicant pools at your library become more diverse in the last five years? N=55\nYes 29 53%\nNo 26 47%\nComments N=24\nAnswered Yes N=8\nAnecdotally, yes.\nIncreased pools are due both to campus and library efforts. \nIt is still a struggle.\nLargely due to the university’s outreach and establishment of a partnership with the city.\nPools are increased in diversity. Hiring statistics remain flat for all but African American, which \nis down.\nThis is difficult to measure because the library did little hiring from external postings for professional \npositions from 2003 through 2013. The library has increased its external professional hiring in \n2014–2017 and has actively recruited for diversity. Since 2014, the library has implemented veterans’ \npreference, which as implemented here allows extra credit for military service. Veterans tend to be a \ndiverse group. \nWe have also relied on our staff to help us recruit diverse candidates. \nYes, but I have no data to support that feeling.\n37SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nAnswered No N=10\nAlthough the post MLS residency program was intended to hire diverse faculty in the UL, we were \nprohibited from limiting the position to only diverse candidates. This program ceased in 2008.\nDemographic information on applicants is not shared by university HR.\nNot sure because of my limited time here.\nThe areas of growth have become more and more selective and niche in various fields of librarianship. \nThe information is unclear on how it is tracked. \nThere has been an increase in male applicants, but the number of racially diverse applicants has \nremained mostly unchanged. \nThere is no method of tracking this in place, so this is anecdotal. We have seen an increase over the past \n10–20 years.\nThey have remained approximately the same.\nThis is difficult to assess within our institution [due to] lack of data regarding applicant pools.\nWe don’t track the diversity of our hiring pools.\nAdditional comments N=8\nUnable to identify data to support responding to this question.\nWe do not have data to demonstrate an increase or decrease.\nWe don’t have the data to answer this question.\nWe don’t know because we do not track this data at the library level. Our Institutional Diversity, Equity, \nand Affirmative Action office monitors this information.\nWe have not analyzed any data yet to determine the success of our recruitment efforts in the area \nof diversity. \nWe haven’t kept stats on this, and I’ve only been here four years, so it’s hard to say.\n22. Has your library encountered any perceived barriers to recruiting diverse applicants for vacant \npositions? N=59\nYes 37 63%\nNo 22 37%\nIf yes, please briefly describe the barrier and any success the library has had in overcoming it. \nN=37\nOccasionally, barriers may be prevalent due to tendency to look for commonalities in the candidate. \nThere is the possibility of subconscious bias at work that we may not be aware of. Claims that there are \nno minorities in applicant pool. Sometimes minorities may not be screened in because (a) others more \nqualified were selected for interviews, (b) some minorities didn’t meet minimum qualifications.\nAdditional requirements and longer timelines for recruiting internationally.\nApplicant pool of librarians is already not very diverse and geography works against us. Our \nlocal community is not particularly diverse and that discourages some from applying or from \naccepting offers.\n38 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nBarriers experienced by most libraries—scant candidates.\nBarriers include few diverse students graduating from LIS programs, being located in a relatively \nunexciting Midwestern non-diverse area. \nBoston’s reputation as a city that is not welcoming to diverse communities is our biggest challenge.\nCampus and community are not seen as diverse or welcoming of individuals who are \ntraditional culture.\nFailure to reach applicants from traditionally marginalized communities; some search committees \nhave addressed this by targeting specific listservs and LIS diversity programs. Many search committees \nwithin the University Libraries struggle with the pre-conception that applicants from traditionally \nmarginalized communities will not want to come to a Predominantly White Institution in Rural \nAppalachia; we have had success in recruiting applicants to our Diversity Resident program. We have \nbegun to see more diversity in our applicant pools, but recruitment and retention remain challenging.\nGeographic location, lack of diversity in library, campus and local community. No successes in \novercoming barriers, yet.\nIdentifying triggers in the employment cycle that affect the recruitment of women, minorities, and \npersons with disabilities across the agency has been the best step in overcoming barriers in recruiting \ndiverse applicants.\nImplicit bias training for hiring managers.\nIncorporating language in job postings that aligns with university policies has been an obstacle. \nPartnering with our Office of Diversity and conveying our diversity goals to upper administrators has \nallowed us to be successful. \nIssues that are mentioned are the pipeline, the lack of diversity in the community, etc. We have also had \ntrouble retaining folks and salary may be an issue.\nIt continues to be difficult to identify qualified candidates from a wide range of all of our positions; \nhowever, all library search committees are required to have a diversity advocate who will serve as \na voice, visible presence, and resource on the committee, including understanding campus policies \nand procedures, working with HR and library faculty on recruitment, and helping assure that search \nprocesses are fair. All search committee diversity advocates receive training from the campus. \nIt seems that we don’t get very many candidates from diverse backgrounds. It seems to me that it \ncomes down to how many diverse graduates there are; there just don’t seem to be very many in the \ncandidate pools.\nKnowing where to post for a more diverse pool.\nLack of diversity in applicant pools\nLack of diversity in LIS program graduates; a geographic location that it is hard to attract applicants to.\nLack of diversity within the organization\nLack of in-depth education of the search and screens, limited time and resources to post in all of the \navailable sources, and being a northern state with cold and snowy winters. We hope the efforts of the \nEquity and Diversity Committee and subcommittees will assist in overcoming the first two. \nLimited by the lack of diversity in the librarian candidate pools.\nLocation in the South is always a barrier for us. \nLocation is perceived as a barrier. We are located in a rural area 3–4 hours from major \nmetropolitan areas.\n39SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nLocation of state, state politics, budget cuts, and guns on campus. \nLocation of the university might be a barrier.\nOur institution is located in a very rural area that has little racial and/or ethnic diversity. It’s been hard \nrecruiting a diverse workforce, especially recruiting people of color, to such a rural community.\nOur rural location \nReluctance on the part of some applicants to relocate here and the perceived quality of public schools.\nRigid, cookie-cutter job postings and job requirements that have not changed in years. The same job \npostings with the same language and requirements yield the same applicant pools. This is starting \nto change this year after the library hired outside consultants to review the recruitment process and \nmake recommendations. \nSalary levels; percentage of diverse applicants in application pools\nThe city is much more diverse and cosmopolitan than most people realize so we try to sell the area in \nour job announcements. \nThe general climate in the state regarding diversity has a chilling effect. \nThough we post our vacancies in a variety of places, our applicant pools remain homogeneous, \nespecially for faculty positions.\nWe are often limited by the diversity experienced in library schools.\nWe have a geographical barrier because of a lack of diverse populations. \nWe have found that the current political climate in our state has affected diverse applicants from \napplying to some of our positions.\nWith many positions, finding the right skill set means a small pool of candidates and difficulty in \nidentifying candidates\nAdditional comments N=3\nTraditional recruiting practices do not always align with diversity efforts and purposes.\nThe current climate of North Carolina’s state government, including the passage of HB2, has definitely \nhurt our recruiting efforts. \nUnable to identify specific data to support responding to this question. At a campus level, the university \nissued an optional survey in Fall 2016 to all employees to understand housing needs in recognition of \nthe high cost of living in the area. Though not supported by data, there is some sense that the high cost \nof living may be a barrier to recruiting at a campus level.\nRETENTION STRATEGIES\n23.

N=13\nAn important strategy for us has been our director’s personal involvement and strong advocacy. \nChallenging language in and requirements listed in job postings. \nHaving a diverse staff helps retain a diverse staff. Individuals from underrepresented groups are \nnot isolated or alone when there is broader diversity throughout the library and campus. Providing \nopportunities such as affinity groups and diversity committees for those who wish to connect \nor contribute in that way. Ensuring that supervisors and managers are welcoming, inclusive, \nand respectful.\nIn light of recent changes in the national climate we initiated a series of open discussion forums for \nemployees to share their experiences with diversity and inclusion, and brainstorm ideas for how the \nLibraries can contribute to a more positive climate.\nOur library has joined the ACRL Diversity Alliance. \nResidency program is being planned now with first hires in Spring 2018.\nThe library in 2014–2017 has offered several professional opportunities limited to applicants from \nwithin its technician (support staff) ranks. This has helped the library retain some excellent employees \nwho would have left for opportunities at other institutions. \nThe UL has a mentoring program that supports each tenure-track untenured faculty member to \npromotion and tenure; however, this program is for ALL untenured faculty, it is not limited to \ndiverse faculty.\nThese strategies are inclusive for all library employees. We have also specifically funded travel to and \nparticipation in non-ALA events including “The Bench by the Road Project” sponsored by the Toni \nMorrison Society, and the Society of American Archivists (SAA) “Liberated Archives.”\nWe became a member of the National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity. The library has \nencouraged our faculty to participate in the weekly projects and workshops, and have sent a junior \nfaculty member to the Summer Boot Camp in order to assess its effectiveness for library faculty.\nWe have a writing group that all new librarians are encouraged to join. This is a support group to help \nnew librarians with their research and scholarly activity. It has been very successful and popular.\nWe have recently proposed a librarian career pathway for student workers in underrepresented groups. \nAlso, we became members of the ACRL Diversity Alliance in February and are still in the planning \nstages for two residency positions. \n41SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nWe include our diversity statement in all of our recruitment postings. \n24.

We \nhave not focused on diverse staff attrition. \nLack of affinity groups. Mentoring program has been facing challenges.\nLack of diversity in library, campus, and local community\nLocation of state, state politics, and guns on campus\nMany advancement opportunities exist for underrepresented minorities. We have very few \nopportunities for advancement to higher levels and so individuals go elsewhere to find those upper level \npositions. Past perceptions that underrepresented minorities were not treated fairly still persist. We are \ntrying to change that perception. It’s slow progress.\nOur appointments as faculty bring added complexity to the work of librarians. The mentoring program, \nthe writing groups, individual liaisons from the Promotion & Tenure Committee, and a variety of \nworkshops help colleagues to feel motivated, supported, and valued.\nOur salaries are not competitive enough.\nRecruiting and retaining diverse groups of employees has been problematic because the applicant pool \nis not diverse. \nRetention in general is an issue for our organization as staff employees can only get promoted through \nopen recruitment. This often means that individuals have to leave the department in order to get a \nhigher title or pay. \nRural location \nSalary levels; availability of permanent positions; regional obstacles (some areas have limited \ncommunity opportunities and engagement)\nSmall community that doesn’t offer sufficient personal resources for some underrepresented employees.\nThe current climate of North Carolina’s state government, including the passage of HB2, has also hurt \nour retention efforts.\nThe local community is not very diverse, creating a sense of isolation.\nThe major obstacle is budgetary. The library simply did not have funds to fill many positions. In the \npast three years we have been able to fill more professional and advanced technical positions, greatly \nimproving our ability to retain a diverse group of employees. \nWe are willing to hire diverse librarians with no professional experience. Once they have professional \nexperience, they are able to get jobs in more prestigious libraries in more exciting cities with \nbetter weather. \nWe have lost some diverse employees due to the climate surrounding diversity issues in the state.\nWe have lost two URM in the last year.\nWe just don’t see them in our applicant pools.\nWe’re nowhere near as diverse as is our student population.\nAdditional comment N=1\nNone noted in the last four years. We did very little hiring up until a few years ago, so we have a large-\nish cohort going through the promotion and tenure process right now.

N=60\nA newly formed committee focused on Diversity & Inclusion.\nA series of Diversity Task Forces (2013–2014; 2016) in the last five years has resulted in assessment of \nthe library culture; creation of an Inclusive Excellence Plan; and the formation of a standing body, the \nDiversity and Inclusive Excellence Working group.\nActively being discussed at Library All Staff Meetings, programs are announced to all staff members \nand encouraged to attend.\nAdded a residency program; joined Diversity Alliance; funding for travel to National Diversity in \nLibraries conference; committed to one year of continuing education topics on diversity and inclusion.\nAround 2009 our diversity committee was disbanded. As a new dean, I hope to begin these efforts \nagain in conjunction with our strategic planning efforts to begin in fall 2017.\nCreated a Diversity and Inclusion Council, launched a Leadership Academy, created a detailed \nmentoring/coaching program.\nCurrent intense focus on recruitment through retention to see what best practices can be incorporated, \nas well as training possibilities. \nDiversity Advisory Committee and diversity and inclusion initiatives/programs have changed from \nfocusing on social responsibility to specific strategic goals and initiatives based on our internal climate \nassessment of our organization, which in turn informed our Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan. \nLibraries senior leadership has charged the Diversity Advisory Committee to work towards a more \ndiverse/inclusive workplace.\n47SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nDiversity Committee now chaired by rotating staff with interest in and commitment to D&I. This made \nthe committee more progressive and action oriented.\nEffort to increase post-MLS residencies and fellowships for archivists and librarians of color. Effort \nto process diverse collections, especially special collections and archives. Creation of Diversity & \nInclusion Working Group in 2016. We have changed some of the hiring processes.\nEstablished a dedicated Diversity Council comprised of stakeholders in every unit; established and \nfunded a diversity residency program; established liaison relationships with intercultural offices \nand centers on campus; developed a librarian exchange program with Cape Peninsula University of \nTechnology; significantly increased the number of diversity workshops, exhibits, and speakers in the \nlibrary; incorporated diversity/inclusion workshops into bi-annual in-service day program.\nExpanded and made programs more comprehensive to those already established to help students and \nstaff. The library has implemented Human Books this past year and will continue to include this yearly. \nWe have also started a program called: CWRU Global Voices, a project that celebrates the individuals \nfrom around the world who make our community unique.\nIncreased awareness. Making physical changes such as gender-neutral washrooms.\nIntegration of a grassroots Diversity Caucus into the library’s committee structure and strategic plan. \nIt is now a more organized effort with better-defined programs. The Equity and Diversity Committee \nand subcommittees are in their first year and we expect to see continued improvement in the \nyears ahead. \nLess oriented toward programs and presentations designed to inform, more oriented toward open \ndialogue and discussion.\nMore external hiring; more use of post-LIS internships and fellowships and of LIS practica. \nOur campus hired its first Vice Chancellor for Diversity & Inclusion! The Libraries had a successful \nand productive partnership with the vice chancellor. Some outcomes included new library programs, \nparticipation by library staff in diversity summits, etc. \nOur changes include the expansion of diversity projects and programming in the Oral History \nDepartment, and an emphasis on partnerships with diverse student organizations for both ongoing \nprogramming as well as special grant-funded outreach programs. In addition, faculty within the \nSpecial Collections division have become involved with the Liberated Archives discussion through \nSAA, and our Women’s Archives have taken on the job of documenting the January 2017 Women’s \nMarches within the state. \nOur programming for educating staff and recruiting a diverse staff have both been ratcheted up \nexponentially in the past five years.\nParent institution has recently articulated a Workplace Diversity and Employment Equity Strategy to \nre-affirm its commitment and to create a framework for future progress. \nPreviously, we had a longstanding diversity committee with only one charge: to recruit and hire the \ndiversity resident every other year. In 2016, when the university created new standards, we began to \nreimagine the committee and the new committee members have been selected and will begin their \nwork late summer.\nRecruitment: changes to the composition of search committees to comply with provost guidelines; \nexperimenting on places to post job vacancies and tracking candidate pools; training committees in \ninclusion and unconscious bias. Change Makers: a program sponsored by the Women’s Center that \nannually creates a cohort of staff & faculty to engage in a personal journey to create a more inclusive \nenvironment. Library has highest number of participants from the program.\n48 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nSubstantial increase with in-house programming, including training workshops, exhibits, etc. \nIncreased collaboration with university Office of Diversity and Inclusion; increased communication of \ndevelopment opportunities available elsewhere in university (lectures, workshops, etc.)\nThe dean’s involvement with the Diversity Committee signified a greater importance to the effort. We \nhave embedded diversity into the overall strategic plan, making sure we look at every initiative from a \ndiversity perspective.\nThe Diversity Committee has a clear purpose and greater visibility but still needs to conduct training \nand offer programs to improve this area.\nThe Libraries’ Diversity Committee has become much more active, going from offering a few events \na year to now offering monthly diversity-related programming. The programming offered by our \nDirector of Program Planning and Outreach has had an increased focus on issues relating to diversity \nand inclusion.\nThe library has expanded collaborations, community engagement, and partnerships. \nThe library has modified a position that was inside HR and focused on development into a Diversity & \nInclusion Specialist position that reports directly to the dean. \nThe library’s interest and emphasis in promoting diversity and inclusion is unchanged. The university is \nplacing more emphasis on diversity and inclusion in its HR practices. \nThe programs and plans of the Diversity Committee have changed with the new membership roles. \nYounger staff have joined and focus has shifted to unconscious bias & microagressions.\nThe quantity and depth of diversity activities and training has increased in the past five years, including \nnumbers of library staff engaged at various levels.\nThe required diversity preference was added in 2014.\nThere has been a greater focus on ensuring that diversity and inclusion is woven into the fabric of all we \ndo and less as stand-alone initiatives.\nThey have not changed much in the past five years, but I anticipate that there will be change within the \nnext year or so. \nThis has become an area of greater importance over the last five years, culminating in the last year with \nthe creation of a library Diversity Committee. \nThis is the first year of our Diversity and Inclusion working group, so it is very early to appreciate \nresults. I think our results will be more significant a year or two from now. We have developed a draft \nDiversity, Inclusion, and Equity statement to align the Libraries to the university’s statement. We hope \nto socialize these ideas and include diversity and inclusion as prominent values in our values statement.\nUniversity-wide programs have expanded in response to changing legislation, the university’s mission, \nand strategic priorities.\nWe administered the ClimateQUAL survey over a three-week period spring 2015. This has provided us \nwith baseline data to help us evaluate many aspects of the workplace related to inclusion and diversity. \nIt has helped us begin to think more strategically about these issues and to begin to develop plans.\nWe are doing fewer programs with more focused efforts on microaggressions, implicit bias, creating \na welcoming and inclusive environment, communication, and conflict management training for \nsupervisors and leaders.\nWe are now offering two minority fellow positions, which are 2-year term positions. Also shifting our \nfocus on more inclusion rather than just diversity. We are now offering a variety of training, i.e., Trans \n101, Safer Places, DBL Inclusion, etc. \n49SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nWe created an inclusion director position that is a direct report to the university librarian, joined the \nACRL Diversity Alliance, started a high school internship program targeting populations historically \nunderrepresented in the profession, and are beginning a partnership with the only HBCU with a \nlibrary science school.\nWe don’t have a library diversity/inclusion program. The library relies on Human Resources to provide \nprograms on diversity/inclusion.\nWe had a program that offered a single library school student tuition support and financial support \nduring school and then a paid residency program after. This program was not continued because it had \nlittle impact for the cost. \nWe have added diversity and inclusion as core values, and a member of our team has been through \nintensive training on the topic. Our Associate Dean of Administrative Services is a member of the \nDiversity Counsel, and we have focused more on bringing staff training programs to the employees \nregarding diversity and inclusion. \nWe have become more proactive in recruiting new faculty from a diverse pool. We have increased the \nnumber of places we advertise. We have also increased activities and relationships with groups on \ncampus through outreach initiatives by librarians. \nWe have become more systematic, more formal and also more informal, more concerned with \nachieving positive, specific outcomes. Changes in the world of librarianship, especially from print to \nelectronic and ownership to access, demand that we be more cognizant of our faculty and staff, their \nskills and their roles, and their opportunities for success. \nWe have broadened the scope of our diversity statement to include staff, services, and collections.\nWe have changed the focus of our showcase series, to offer more informal presentations than in the \npast, inviting community leaders to participate in “kitchen table” conversations about issues related to \nsocial justice, race, ethnicity, disabilities, etc.\nWe have created a Library Diversity and Inclusion Committee that has been charged with many \nlibrary initiatives. \nWe have expanded our efforts to insure our initiatives include more than just race/ethnicity. As a result, \nwe have had more training opportunities in the areas of age, gender, sexual orientation, language, \nreligion, disability and/or health status, gender identity/expression, veteran status, geographic origins, \nand socio-economic status.\nWe have made a concerted effort to directly identify diversity in all our programs—calling it out as a \nspecific component in all our programs and services.\nWe have not had a plan or focused initiatives in the past. We now have a robust, comprehensive, \nmeasurable plan in place, so the change is significant.\nWe have provided implicit bias awareness training to all staff with longer workshops for supervisors. \nWe are examining our employee viewpoint survey from a variety of demographic angles.\nWe have representation on the campus Academic Council for Diversity & Inclusion. This group is \ndeveloping a theory of change for recruiting and retaining a diverse study body as well as a diverse body \nof faculty and staff.\nWe haven’t had any specific plans in the past, though this may change given the creation of our recent \nDiversity and Inclusion Team, as well as an increasing notice on campus of issues related to diversity \nand inclusion. We have also recently posted a position for an Inclusion and Accessibility Librarian. \nA note that our Resident Librarian Program, while created more than five years ago, was partly in \nresponse to campus-wide efforts to diversify staff. However, due to budget constraints the program has \n50 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nbeen reduced from two positions down to one. We have also worked to improve access to the Libraries’ \ncollections and use of them by patrons through upgrades and additions to our adaptive technologies, \nsuch as braille printers, a portable reading camera, and the installation of various assistive software to \nour public workstations. We have also hosted a Human Library event for the past four years to celebrate \ncampus diversity and encourage inclusive dialogue. \nWe recently joined the ACRL Diversity Alliance and will be starting a diversity residency program \nsoon. We have hosted ARL diversity programs and try to recruit from these cohorts. We have a \ncomprehensive IT accessibility plan and have made changes in our website, purchasing procedures, \nstaff training, etc.\nWe’ve become more active and strategic in developing and providing programming for internal and \nexternal audiences.\nWith the changing of job duties of the Diversity Librarian there has been a lack of leadership and plan. \nThe plan has not been updated since 2010.\nWith the creation of the diversity plan we have been more proactive in developing diversity-related \nprograms. Additionally, we are making our diversity efforts more visible to our users and employees. \n31. Please indicate which factors have influenced changes in diversity/inclusion activities at your \nlibrary. Check all that apply.

N=19\nA well-supported Office of Institutional Diversity made a huge difference.\nCampus climate around diversity & inclusion warranted the changes.\nChanges in national climate\nChanges in staff makeup and committee membership\nChanges in the political and economic worlds motivate us to have new approaches, more openness, and \nmore appreciation for equity and social justice.\nDevelopment of university and Libraries strategic plans with objectives to address student success, \ninclusive excellence, and library culture.\nGrassroots effort of staff and groups committed to diversity and inclusion. \nIncreased concerns on campus related to issues at the national level.\nIncreased staff interest and desire to develop diversity programming.\nIncreasing general interest in, and commitment to, diversity and inclusion.\nInterest by individual librarians\nIt is the right thing to do.\nNeed to be responsive to state accountability requirements; renewed interest within the libraries \nrelated to diversity/inclusion. \n51SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nNo change in administration, just new focus on improving our efforts.\nSpecific hires with interest in D&I issues and advocacy.\nStudent activism\nThe university formed a task force to explore diversity, inclusion, and equity throughout the university. \nThey have made recommendation for very lofty goals that will certainly challenge and motivate us to \ndrive change in the next few years. \nThe university’s emphasis on diversity and inclusion has helped everyone on campus become more \naware of the importance of diversity/inclusion activities. \nThere was a racially charged incident on campus, and this has led to the creation of a campus Office of \nCommunity. This office has driven a number of campus initiatives of which the library is part.\n32. Please briefly describe how your library has responded to social movements (such as Black Lives \nMatter, immigration, or the Dakota Access Pipeline protest) within the last five years. N=52\nActions based on Truth and Reconciliation Report.\nAlthough the campus has not seen the depth of emotion that has impacted other campuses, our \nDiversity and Inclusion Council was created to increase cultural literacy on campus and within the \nlibraries in part to prepare for a time when emotional events occur on campus.\nAs a government agency, the Library of Congress documents social movements through its collections, \nbut it cannot “respond” to social or political trends. \nAs an institution, we have hosted temporary exhibits on these movements, presented community \nworkshops on the role of librarians in social justice campaigns, and sponsored speaker series \nin collaboration with other university entities. Individual employees have participated in \nadditional efforts.\nAttempts have been made and questions have been asked how to get involved by faculty and staff. \nIndividuals have chosen to become more involved. The Libraries did not issue any public statements \nregarding these movements. \nBeginning in December 2016, the UIUC Library has played a significant role in creating a countywide \ncommunity library social action group with the following vision: “We envision a just, equitable, and \nanti-oppressive community in Champaign County, central Illinois, and beyond where all library & \ninformation workers are active agents for change.” All four members of the Steering Team are UIUC \nLibrary staff. \nBLM book display; Hate Has No Home Here signs; other inclusive signage\nBy starting projects such as DataRefuge, so that information remains freely available.\nClasses, exhibitions, and programs on black activism and the arts. LGBTQ collections integrated in \nclasses and exhibitions. Hosted events by campus organizations focused on social justice.\nEfforts have included book and poster displays, online resource guides, and exhibits. We have also \nprovided a welcoming space for related student protests, exhibits, and events.\nEmail address by the university librarian re: immigration and election. Supported Data Refuge \nefforts. Communications and training on how to verify news sources (fake news). Created gender-\nneutral restrooms.\nExhibits, partnerships with campus cultural affinity groups, book talks\nFairly quiet\n52 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nImmigration Project: International students are an important part of our university’s story. In order to \nensure that our international student’s stories are preserved, we are launching CWRU Global Voices, a \nproject that celebrates the individuals from around the world who make our community unique. \nIncreased and made available related resources via purchasing, research guides, etc.\nInformal forum discussing de-naming/re-naming of buildings; formal inclusion statement\nLibrarians have developed LibGuides—one for DAPL and a guide that highlights the collections of \nthe Center for South West Research (CSWR). CSWR celebrates diversity and inclusion by collecting \nmaterials that document the experiences of people from all walks of life who have contributed to New \nMexico, the United States, and the world. \nMade diversity and inclusion a topic of conversation for students, faculty, and staff.\nMost recently, our Women’s Archives, which has an emphasis on preserving information about women \nassociated with our state, actively solicited donations of materials associated with the Women’s \nMarches held in our state in January of 2017, and, as previously mentioned, our Special Collections \ndivision faculty are involved in SAA’s Liberated Archives discussions.\nNothing formal\nNothing specific related to these events.\nOur College Library (undergraduate library) often sees protests in their library and has worked \nwith campus and university police to allow these protests, including Black Lives Matter, to happen \npeacefully within the library. We have also had many displays and our books to browse often represent \nsocial movements. We support diverse student groups and encourage them and others to gather in our \nspaces. We have also had presentations/discussions around recent social justice issues affecting our \ncampus and community.\nOutreach to the Minority Rights Coalition, participated in the Charlottesville Human Library, hosted a \nsafe space for students following the election.\nParticipated in recent (i.e., post-Trump) campus rallies and provided space for student activities to \nsupport them.\nPost 2016 presidential election, after a rise in hate crimes and hate speech in and around libraries \nand college campuses, the dean of libraries issued an open letter to campus reaffirming the Libraries’ \ncommitment to fostering mutual respect, inclusion, and intellectual freedom, as well as the Libraries \nservices and spaces as welcoming, inclusive environments, irrespective of background or beliefs. On \nJanuary 25, 2017, a grassroots solidarity event was organized by numerous employees of the Libraries \nto show solidarity and support of students, particularly underrepresented and marginalized student \npopulations, and affirming the Libraries as a place of inclusion. This event was held on the same day the \ncontroversial figure Milo Yiannopolous was scheduled to speak on campus.\nProjects that are in progress include a Black Lives Matter LibGuide, LGBTQ LibGuide, and we’ve \ninitiated discussions regarding gender-neutral restrooms within the library. \nRecognized statewide efforts to address human trafficking by offering programs on this topic. \nIntegrated BLM into library programming.\nSocial movements are addressed through library programming and exhibits.\nSome examples include: Writing a letter of support and accountability to students, staff, and faculty \nof color during protests on campus about race and violence towards People of Color; created a social \njustice library guide; created reflection rooms in two of the largest libraries on campus; provided free \ngender pronoun buttons for faculty, staff, and students on campus; encouraged and supported library \nfaculty and staff to state their preferred pronouns in emails and when introducing themselves to \n53SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nothers; created lactation rooms in two of the busiest libraries on campus; added new gender inclusive \nrestrooms on two of the largest libraries on campus; hosted a Standing Rock Teach-in; produced a \npublic display of support for Pulse nightclub victims in Orlando, FL; posting public “all are welcome” \nsignage following the January 27, 2017 Executive Order, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist \nEntry into the United States;” supported library faculty and staff attending BLM and Trans rights \nevents on campus; \nStaff have been encouraged to contribute and participate; various outreach efforts including \nbookmobiles, creating a political action space.\nThe agency’s employee affinity groups have hosted and promoted events to respond to \nsocial movements.\nThe diversity committee has had several open forums for staff to discuss and reflect in a safe non-\njudgmental space. The sessions have been successful.\nThe expanded collaborations, community engagement, and partnerships mentioned above result from \ngrowing awareness and commitment to the role of libraries in social justice.\nThe Libraries align with the university’s broader response. \nThe Libraries faculty and staff have participated in planning and delivery of programs, (including \nproviding technical support and facilities space to various campus groups) addressing Black Lives \nMatter, immigration, disability awareness, and Rise Above Week, which is designed to provide \nopportunities for the university community to dialogue about how to further justice and eradicate \noppression. The Libraries have participated in the campus initiative related to Social Justice Day by \ncreating an online presence to highlight campus research and library collections on the following \nthemes: (1) Immigration in the 21st Century; (2) Economic Development and Inequality; (3) \nEnvironmental Justice; (4) Creating Healthy Communities; and (5) Media and Inequality. \nThe Libraries has at least one librarian working on documenting social movements such as Black Lives \nMatter. These social movements and the current political climate have created increased awareness \nof issues relating to diversity and inclusion. As a result, staff have been asking for and creating \ntraining and programming. Topics have included de-escalation, implicit bias, and women in STEM/\nmaking fields. \nThe library has hosted programs and created a new program series to provide safe spaces for having \nconversations about these issues. We also participate in campus conferences to discuss effective \napproaches when confronted with race, social, and environmental justice situations.\nThe library has not as an organization responded to specific social movements such as the ones listed. \nToo many actions to list. We have very engaged faculty librarians who have the academic freedom to \npursue interests.\nWe created an online and physical book display on Black Lives Matter.\nWe have decided to display our Principles of Community, a university-wide statement that addresses \ninclusivity, in the public areas of the library.\nWe have had discussions regarding the Orlando tragedy, immigration, and DACA concerns.\nWe have not done much in this area.\nWe have not responded as an organization but we do have librarians and staff who participate on \ntheir own.\nWe have offered programming and participated in campus activities.\n54 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nWe have started internal Safe Space Dialogues to allow library employees to openly express how \nsuch issues impact them and their lives in a safe and supportive environment. We have reached out to \nstudent organizations to offer library space for social justice activity. We have sought out social justice \nfocused programs and have built social justice focused exhibits. \nWe have tried to host educational events and opportunities for employees to get support.\nWe have tried to provide opportunities for individuals, both users and staff, to share and address \ntheir concerns, such as comment boards, discussions, and providing quality information to \ncounteract misinformation.\nWe provide space for student organizations.\nWe regular host table talks and forums regarding current issues, usually through our Russell Political \nLibrary. Recently, the UGA Press (which is part of the Libraries organizationally) published the \nCharleston Syllabus and held a symposium. Inspired by the #CharlestonSyllabus hashtag campaign \nborn in the wake of the June 17 massacre at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, this symposium \nwas open to UGA students and faculty to come together to discuss the current state of race relations, \nracial violence, and civil rights activism in the US. The program featured speakers including historians, \nactivists, etc.\nWe support institutional initiatives that are formulated by relevant campus partners.\nWe’ve not directly addressed.\n33. Please briefly describe how these movements have affected your diversity plans/programs. N=33\nAccelerated them.\nAn increased awareness in the local community of the Libraries’ commitment to diversity \nand inclusion.\nAs the library has become more cognizant of the issues, the library has become determined to ensure \nthat all students, faculty, staff, and community know that we are a safe and welcoming space.\nHeightened awareness and created greater urgency to create such programs.\nIncreased awareness of student interest in using the library space in this way.\nIncreased interest and participation\nIt has moved our focus from just being on diversity (meaning the presence of diversity) to also being \nfocused on equity and inclusion. \nLittle affect.\nMade our diversity plan a priority, not just nice to have on the shelf.\nMore discussion of librarians’ roles in social justice movements.\nN/A. There are no plans in progress.\nNo affect\nNo affect so far\nNo change that we can see, except perhaps a greater need to have more diversity plans/programs.\nNot affected our programs.\nOne reason for the rewrite of our plan is to cover a broader scope of issues and concerns not only for the \nLibraries, but the campus and the broader social issues.\nPeripherally informed our thinking, not directly impacted our content.\n55SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nPrograms and exhibits address contemporary social movements.\nProvided a focal point on what to address.\nThe movements have highlighted the need for us to be more active and intentional in providing \nprogramming that addresses relevant contemporary issues.\nThe university is expanding opportunities for collaborations, community engagement, and \npartnerships as well.\nThese items are kept in mind when deciding on trainings or lunch discussion topics. Social justice is \nalso mentioned in our diversity statement and our recruiting statement.\nThese movements have bolstered ongoing diversity efforts in the libraries. \nThese movements have primarily provided content guidelines for library events and workshops. It is \nnot clear how they have affected the frequency of outreach.\nThese social movements provide a space for our committee to volunteer and partner with the \nuniversity’s Office of Diversity. \nThey have made staff more interested in them as a whole.\nThey have steered us to a more active role, more focus on individuals, not only groups, and more dialog.\nThey provided us with a way of emphasizing to the campus and the public that all of the \nlibrary’s special collections are tied to current events in some way and are not just dusty \nhistorical reminiscences. \nWe don’t have diversity plans or programs. \nWe have energized our outreach efforts especially to student groups.\nWe plan to bring relevant information to staff in timely ways.\nWe try to develop diversity programs based on current social issues to bring awareness.\nWhen the library begins to develop a library-wide diversity strategic plan, it will be sure to include \noutreach to the community as one of its goals.\n34. Has your library used the 2012 ACRL diversity standards in any way? N=65\nYes 15 23% \nNo 50 77% \nIf yes, please briefly describe how the library has used these standards. N=13\nAdopting diversity plan\nAs a reference\nAs we develop diversity-related programs and services, we establish desired outcomes or learning \nobjectives based on the diversity standards.\nMainly as a reference\nThe Diversity Task Force used these when reviewing documents and working to build their report \nand recommendations.\nThe standards were used as a reference to develop our Library Diversity & Inclusion Committee.\nWe consulted the standards at the time of developing our diversity plan.\nWe consulted the standards when developing the Libraries diversity definition and goals.\n56 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nWe have incorporated selected concepts into our strategic plan. The Diversity Council has also drawn \ngoals from these guidelines. We have much more work to do.\nWe have used those to help us with the rewrite of our diversity plan.\nWe reviewed them when creating our diversity plan.\nWe use the standards as a resource for determining areas for staff development activities.\nWe’ve used as a reference starting place. \nADDITIONAL COMMENTS\n35. Please enter any additional information about diversity and inclusion plans and programs at your \nlibrary that may assist the authors in accurately analyzing the results of this survey. N=27\nAlthough we have done very little in the past 10 years to address diversity beyond supporting staff \nto participate at university-level initiatives, I hope to bring more attention to this issue during our \nstrategic planning activities, commencing in fall 2017.\nCurrently, we rely largely on the institute-wide programs to foster an environment of diversity and \ninclusion, and at this time don’t create additional programmatic initiatives specific to the library. We \ndon’t have any targeted recruiting initiatives towards diverse applicants, but in the future, hope to \ncreate fellowships that target diverse candidates.\nIn fall of 2016, the university librarian made a call to create the Diversity & Inclusion Working \nGroup, which is charged with researching issues of diversity & inclusion for our library system and \nmaking recommendations to the administration on how to proceed. The plans include strategies \naround staffing/hiring/retention, user services (faculty & students), programming & exhibitions, and \ncollection development. \nIn spring 2017, the campus participated in an external review on diversity and inclusion requested by \nthe chancellor. One recommendation from this review is for the campus to “develop a diversity equity \nstrategic plan or framework aligned with the University Strategic Planning efforts that builds upon the \nwork of previous diversity-planning efforts.” These efforts will probably take place over the next two \nyears, and the Library Diversity Committee will look for direction from the campus regarding creating \na Diversity Strategic Plan for the library. \nIn the fall of 2016, the parent institution announced the development of an Indigenous Strategy, which \nis now being adopted across campus. The library has hired an indigenous student to work on related \nprojects and acquired collections of interest to the indigenous community. \nLibraries have a popular social justice LibGuide. Libraries have added gender inclusive restrooms in the \ntwo most heavily used libraries. Libraries have added reflection rooms in the two largest libraries on \ncampus. Libraries have added lactation rooms in the two busiest libraries. \nLittle overt support is given formally to the efforts of the committee to meet our goals/plan. \nMembership on the committee is voluntary, and considered “extra” to folks’ regular duties. However, \nall financial requests have been met, with some exceptions due to the high cost of a proposal.\nLiving in a large cosmopolitan city, we have more diversity throughout the university. We have \nmuch work to do but the university is very supportive and this is a recent development since our new \npresident (of the university) took over in 2016. \nOur diversity plan was first written in 2006, and updated in 2010–2011. An in-house climate survey \nwas done prior to 2006; the 2011 plan included a survey but this was not conducted due to changing \npriorities. Current diversity goals are included in our new strategic plan. A campus-wide student \n57SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nexperience survey was conducted in January 2017 as part of a university-wide diversity focus, but \nresults from that survey have not yet been shared with the Libraries.\nOur library’s Diversity and Inclusion Committee is composed of faculty, staff, and administrators. We \nalso have a Diversity Officer who liaises with other officers on campus and the university’s Office of \nDiversity and Inclusion. Our library supports the National Conference on Diversity, Race, and Learning \nand sends several faculty/staff/administrators to attend every year.\nOur newly formed Diversity and Inclusion Team is currently working on potential plans for the future. \nThis working group was inspired by the recent university-level diversity and inclusion working group, \nas well as an overall need to address diversity and inclusion issues. Proposals were put forward by \nboth a librarian with a strong interest in this issue and an administrator who felt that this team would \nmeet a need in the library. While we do not currently have a library diversity plan, a climate survey \nand resulting report issued by our parent institution has resulted in more campus-wide discussions \nand initiatives related to diversity/inclusion, which our newly formed Diversity and Inclusion Team \nis taking into consideration as it moves into its pilot year. As our group was just recently formed, \nwe are using this year to identify priorities, goals, and possible revisions to the initial charge for the \nyear(s) ahead. \nOur plans don’t really fit your questions. We have initiatives and programs but they don’t necessarily fit \nin your categories. \nRecently (4/17) the Libraries received a Campus Diversity Award by the university’s most dedicated \nadvocates for diversity as recognized by students and sponsored by various student groups (UMC, \nUMOJA, Latinx Coalition, Lambda Alliance, APSC, PAGE and PRISM) \nRelative to our operating budget and organizational influence, the University Libraries has dedicated \na small amount of time, personnel, and financial resources to diversity and inclusion. We have seen \nsignificant success with programming, particularly in terms of temporary exhibits, guest speakers, \nand our diversity residency pilot. We have also made great progress in connecting library employees \nwith opportunities to increase their cultural competence. However, staff demographics are relatively \nhomogeneous (on par with or less equitable than the professional at large). We have a long way to go \nbefore we meet the ACRL Diversity Standards.\nReorganization created diversity and inclusion orphans, since adopted by new leadership.\nSeveral librarians have initiated the Human Library Program to support our diversity efforts. We \npiloted this in October 2016 with moderate success. However, we have another one scheduled for \nSeptember 5, 2017, that is focused on engaging with our African American community, both on campus \nand externally.\nSome of our efforts towards greater diversity and inclusion in our collections and outreach are ongoing \nso have not been captured in this survey (since there has been no change in the past five years). \nA number of our units, including the Archives, the Oral History Research Program, Government \nDocuments, Maps and Spatial Data, and Community Outreach Programming have worked \ncollaboratively with tribal libraries and museums over the years on cultural heritage grants, projects, \nand workshops, and we continue to do so.\nStrategic planning is an opportunity to include diversity and inclusion initiatives throughout our \nstrategic priorities. \nThe institution’s Office of Inclusion website is referenced often by our HR personnel to ensure that we \nare in line with university standards. \n58 Survey Results: Survey Questions and Responses\nThe library’s role in providing a safe and welcoming space for our diverse campus community is the \ntopic of staff-wide dialogue via in-person meetings, sharing staff-wide email information about what \nother libraries are doing, and the emergence of a staff Diversity and Inclusion Committee. \nThe university has had a diversity and inclusion counsel for several years, and the libraries have \npartnered with them to provide materials that are of interest and assistance to their efforts. For \nexample, we have added to our collections any books they recommend. We also have strong \npartnerships with our student government and other student organizations such as the Student \nDisabilities Resource Center. \nThe university is strongly committed to the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusivity. The \nuniversity has robust programs and staffing to support these principles, and the Libraries align with \nlarger institutional goals and activities.\nThere are designated campus offices that take the lead for ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace. \nThe library supports these initiatives and we are guided by their policies and procedures.\nThere are faculty who have been working with diversity initiatives and research for several years. \nThe Libraries have supported faculty in development programs. The Center for Research in Digital \nHumanities (CRDH) has been supportive in the development of diversity and inclusion issues within \nthe digital humanities field. \nWe are striving to do more. We have a strong and widespread interest in these issues, from the \nadministration to the front line staff.\nWe found that many of our problems were not just isolated to underrepresented minorities. We had \na bigger issue of leadership and management understanding what leadership means and how they \ncontribute to the diversity of the libraries. We are trying to address that with a change in emphasis for \nprograms that enhance leadership skills as well as understanding of diverse issues. Another challenge \nis what we call the ghosts in the library—those norms, habits, and ways of communicating that have \npersisted for decades. We are trying to move beyond those ghosts and find different ways of interacting \nwith each other. It’s slow progress.\nWe have been working with campus to change some of our gendered restrooms into gender-neutral \nrestrooms. We also have a unique program that started in 2006 called Information Specialist \nInternship Program (ISIP). The program is aimed at providing an experiential learning opportunity \nto second and third-year undergraduates.

The University Libraries \nrecognizes and affirms that inclusive excellence is part of our professional practice of \nlibrarianship. The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Framework for \nInformation Literacy in Higher Education guides us in recognizing and instructing on how \ninformation plays a role in inclusivity and excellence. Building community, cultivating openness, \nand attaining a high quality of performance and service are aspects of inclusive excellence that \nresonate strongly with the University Libraries. \nExcellence at the University Libraries is to create spaces and provide services broadly, \nindividually, and inclusively, and to provide essential scholarly resources that enable students, \nfaculty, and the greater University of Colorado and Boulder community to discover and embrace \nideas and points of view that are not part of their native experience. \n \nCurrent Strategies for Inclusive Excellence at the University Libraries \n \nThe University Libraries is uniquely positioned in the campus community as a dynamic partner \nto all and envisions itself as the heart of higher education, providing essential scholarly \nresources, user-centered services, and inclusive spaces.  \n \nBeing a dynamic partner means engaging with and supporting students, faculty, and campus \nbeyond traditional roles of librarianship. Whether it is inviting therapy dogs to libraries during \nfinals or simply listening to a student who is struggling with a course assignment, those within \nthe University Libraries adapt their services to individual needs and contexts. Furthermore, \nmany within the Libraries advocate beyond library activities to strengthen the inclusivity of the \nCU-Boulder community, from supporting the adoption of the EcoPass for all employees to \nsponsoring and leading a salsa club for students. \n \nInclusive space is also a cornerstone of what inclusive excellence is for each of our six libraries \non campus. Both collaborative and quiet spaces are available to all students, meeting their \nacademic needs in ways that few other spaces on campus can. We continue to assess and \n65SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nUNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER LIBRARIES\nInclusive Excellence Plan for the University Libraries\nmodify our spaces to address the evolving needs of our students. Our libraries provide safe, \nwelcoming, and respectful environments for all students and the campus community.  \n \nProviding scholarly resources involves the thoughtful and deliberate work of the University \nLibraries to enable access and discovery of information to broad and diverse student \npopulations. Supporting and promoting a campuswide Open Access policy, standardizing the \npurchase of DVDs to include closed captioning, and proposing new subject headings to the \nLibrary of Congress to further discovery of distinctive materials are examples that demonstrate \nthe comprehensive effort the University Libraries take to enhance access and discovery of \ninformation in an inclusive manner. \n \nUniversity Libraries Goals for Enhancing Inclusive Excellence \n○ Inclusive Spaces:  \n■ As high-impact, prominent spaces on campus, identify and address the \nneed for gender neutral bathrooms within library spaces. \n■ Continue assessment of spaces for ADA compliance and accessibility. \n○ Dynamic Partnership:  \n■ Continue to foster partnerships with campus and student organizations, \nformally or informally \n■ Explore providing employees with training opportunities that address \ninclusivity in customer service and supporting diverse and distinctive \npopulations. \n○ Access to Information \n■ Continue emphasis and assessment of inclusivity in access to resources \nincluding improved discovery and universal design. \n○ Inclusive Excellence within University Libraries:  \n■ Continue to foster and build community among those within the University \nLibraries, enhancing cross-departmental collaboration and \ncommunication. \n■ Re-establish a standing committee for Diversity & Inclusive Excellence \ncarrying out inclusive excellence actions.  \n \n \n \n66  Representative Documents: Library Diversity Goals, Values, Statements\nUNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA LIBRARIES\nGeorge A.

Library staff organize, preserve, and share resources to \nmeet the information needs of the university community, providing access to resources essential to \nteaching, research, and service.  Our buildings provide both the physical space and the intellectual \nenvironment for students, faculty, and staff to meet, engage, learn, and create new knowledge. Library \nstaff go beyond the role of information gate-keepers, teaching important information literacy and \nresearch skills and proactively preserving our region’s history and culture. Reaching beyond the \nuniversity community, we extend information services to the state and make our unique holdings \navailable to the world.   \nVISION \nAs economic forces and technological innovation bring major change to higher education, the LSU \nLibraries will transform itself so that it can continue to provide essential resources, both physical and \nintellectual, to support the students, faculty, and staff of the university in their pursuit of excellence.  \nWe will \n use our specialized expertise in information management to maximize access to needed \ninformation.   \n extend our teaching role to provide students with information literacy skills they need to \nachieve the highest levels of intellectual and personal development.   \n provide leadership in organizing, preserving and providing access to scholarship, research, and \ncreative works produced at the university.   \n collaborate with teaching and research faculty, with business and industry, and with other \nlibraries and organizations in order to share resources and better serve our constituents.  \n capitalize on the unique history and environment of Louisiana and LSU to enhance the LSU \nLibraries’ reputation as one of the top research libraries in the country. \nVALUES \nPursuing our mission, we will value and promote \n an organizational culture of flexibility, fairness, collegiality, communication, diversity, and \nrespect; \n a service-oriented culture that makes the needs of LSU’s students, faculty, and staff its highest \npriority; \n information literacy and other skills needed for lifelong learning; \n strong and diverse information resources and collections that support the university’s mission \nand preserve of the unique history and culture of Louisiana and the lower Mississippi Valley; \n ongoing planning, evaluation, and change to maintain improvement and respond to the \nchanging needs of the university; \n engagement with the university community, the public, and the profession of librarianship to \npromote positive change. \n73SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nLOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES\nLibraries Strategic Plan 2012–2020: Goal III. Diversity \nhttp://www.lib.lsu.edu/sites/all/files/admin/LSULibrariesStrategicPlan2020.pdf\nLSU Libraries Strategic Plan 2012 | 6 \n \n Assessment data is used to guide development/continuation/elimination of various \nlibrary instruction methods and efforts, so that the methods we continue \nincreasingly demonstrate that students who participate are more likely to succeed.  \n More types of library instruction offerings and more courses in which information \nliteracy skills are embedded with the assistance of library faculty, adding at least \none per year. \n Increased participation of Libraries staff in recruitment of students, adding at least \none new activity or offering per semester. \n Increased participation of Libraries staff in retention of students, adding at least one \nnew activity or offering per semester in collaboration with the Center for Academic \nSuccess and other student support services as appropriate. \n Increased participation of Libraries staff in recruitment, retention, and outreach \nactivities serving graduate students and faculty, adding at least one new activity or \noffering per semester. \n Improved library facilities offering more study space for students and better \nenvironmental conditions for Special Collections and rare government documents \nover the next three years. \n \nIII. Diversity: Foster diversity among our faculty and staff.  In addition, we will foster diversity \nin the information resources we collect and to which we provide access, as well as in the \nservices we provide, the better to serve our varied constituencies. \nBackground: Over the last five years, the LSU Libraries has hired four staff members from \ngroups who are currently underrepresented.  Libraries’ faculty provide presentations \ntailored specifically for diverse campus groups such as the McNair Scholars, the Summer \nScholars, the LA-STEM students, and the Osher Lifelong Learners Institute.  We have \npurchased African-American research materials such as Black Short Fiction and Folklore and \nBlack Thought and Culture (databases offered by Alexander Street Press), subscribed to the \nOxford African-American Studies Center database, and subscribed to the journal Du Bois \nReview:  Social Science Research.    \nStrategies:    \n Develop an internship program for minority librarians, making use of vacant \npositions as they occur and/or with support from donors or grants. \n Develop  assessment tools to guide measures to improve collegiality and morale and \nimplement needed actions as indicated by those tools. \n Develop assessment tools to determine how library services can best be \nindividualized to meet the diverse needs of students and faculty and implement \nthose customized services. \n Augment outreach to communities in Louisiana who are underrepresented in our \ncollections in order to foster increased collection development and preservation of \nunique resources. \n74  Representative Documents: Library Diversity Goals, Values, Statements\nLOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES\nLibraries Strategic Plan 2012–2020: Goal III. Diversity \nhttp://www.lib.lsu.edu/sites/all/files/admin/LSULibrariesStrategicPlan2020.pdf\nLSU Libraries Strategic Plan 2012 | 7 \n \n \nPerformance Indicators: \n• Increased number of library faculty and staff from groups that are currently \nunderrepresented by approximately 10% (1 hire) per year. \n• Statistically significant improvement in collegiality and morale as indicated by \nassessment tools. \n• Implementation of at least one new service per year designed specifically to reach \ndiverse constituencies, including but not limited to underrepresented groups, non-\ntraditional students, and people with disabilities. \n• Increased resources documenting the history and culture of Louisianans who are \ncurrently underrepresented in our holdings, especially emphasizing African-\nAmerican resources : seek a minimum of 5 new contacts with potential donors and \nat least one donation per year. \n \nIV. Engagement: Foster engagement of Libraries’ faculty and staff to promote excellence and \ncontinuous improvement within our own organizational structure, achievement as \nresearchers/scholars, and service to the profession and community. \nBackground: The library has a mentoring program in place that has been successful in \nassisting tenure-track librarians to achieve promotion and tenure.  Internal training sessions \noccur on a bi-weekly basis, and most staff and faculty participate in two or more continuing \neducation opportunities each semester.  In the last five years, six staff have earned \nadvanced degrees (four in Library and Information Science) and four staff have participated \nin the university’s Lead/Emerge Program.  Faculty have been selected to participate in the \nHarvard Institutes for Higher Education Leadership Institute for Academic Libraries and the \nArchives Leadership Institute funded by the National Historical Publications and Records \nCommission.  Faculty members have held twelve elected or appointed positions in national \nprofessional organizations, and more than a dozen positions at the regional, state, and local \nlevels.  More than a dozen faculty and staff have received national, regional and state-level \nawards for professional achievement or service.  Faculty serve on state and national \nadvisory boards, including the Louisiana Historical Records Advisory Board, the Louisiana \nAdvisory Council for the State Documents Depository Program, and the federal Depository \nLibrary Council, which advises the Public Printer of the United States.  \nStrategies: \n The Dean’s Advisory Group will monitor implementation of the strategic plan, with a \nformal quarterly review.  Bringing in additional personnel as needed, the AG will \nconduct an annual review of the plan, revising  and updating it annually to maintain \nits usefulness. \n The Dean’s Advisory Group will examine the library’s organizational structure and \nmake recommendations to adapt to emerging needs. \n Adopt the Google 80/20 model to encourage innovation and engagement. \n75SPEC Kit 356:

We stand with those \nwho oppose bigotry, racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, ableism, and sexual predation and assault. We \naffirm that social injustices and oppression of people are wrong, and are a danger to the open, respectful \nenvironments we need to carry out our university and library missions.\nLibraries empower all members of our community to explore their cultures and identities, to create and access \nknowledge, and to connect with the full range of human experience. The values of equality and intellectual \nfreedom, and a belief in the intrinsic worth of individuals are foundational to this work. We express these values \nby embracing diversity and inclusion in all of its forms including, but not limited to, differences in race, ethnicity, \nsex, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, age, religion, and economic status. We oppose any attempts, \npolitical or otherwise, to use these human characteristics to demean, devalue, or harm members of our \ncommunity.\nThe search for truth and knowledge requires access to the perspectives of not only those in the dominant culture, \nbut also the voices of people with less power in our society, people whose viewpoints are often suppressed or \nomitted from the narrative. It demands critical thinking, reflection, and respectful community dialogue. It calls for\nthe use of courageous intellectual exploration, analysis, and evidence to advance knowledge, ideally in an \nenvironment free of discrimination and intimidation.\nFor this reason, in our roles as library and educational professionals, we pledge to honor diversity and inclusion,\nto support all students, faculty, and staff—including those who are feeling vulnerable and who struggle against \nprejudice, discrimination, harassment, and violence—and to offer library services, content, and collections that \nwill enable our communities’ inquiries about political, racial, and other social injustices occurring in our world. \nYours respectfully,\nKeri Aronson\nJaye Barlous\nCheryl Bemiss\nPat Best\nAndrew Bonamici \nKay Brooks\nSara Brownmiller\nTatiana Bryant\nBarbara Butler\nJonathan Cain\nDamon Campbell \nChristine Carmichael \nHana Chan\nHelen Chu\nEric Clark\nLaura Damiani\nSara DeWaay\nErin Doerner\nBronwyn Dorhofer\nJeremy Echols\nTim Erickson\nPat Fellows\nRebecca Fisher\nCatherine Flynn-Purvis\nDavid Fowler\nNina Fox\nSam Galli\nMary Galvin \nAmanda Garcia\nMary Grenci\nLydia Harlan \nShelley Harshe \nCarolina Hernandez\nRyan Hildebrand\nMary Ann Hyatt\nBarbara Jenkins\nBetsy Kelly\nDavid Ketchum\nHolli Kubly\nAmy Lake\nDavid Landazuri\nLesli Larson\nRosella Layton\nAudrey Lee\nKaty Lenn\nRachel Lilley\nAdriene Lim\nLinda Long\nKaren Matson \nKevin McDowell\nKumiko McDowell\nTerry McQuilkin\nDanielle Mericle\nSusan Merrell\nAnn Miller \nVictoria Mitchell\nMarilyn Mohr\nPatrick Moore\nKaren Munro \nLara Nesselroad\nElizabeth Peterson\nBrock Pitzer\nMarilyn Reaves\nKelly Reynolds\nMiriam Rigby\nLori Robare\nAnn Shaffer\nHeidi Scheidl\nSarah Seymore\nJulia Simic\nNancy Slight-Gibney\nHarriett Smith\nJan Smith\nRaina Smith\nJeffrey Staiger\nTyler Stewart\nKathy Stroud\nBruce Tabb\nJohn Taylor\nEd Teague\nTiffany Thornton\nSamuel Villalobos\nDean Walton\nXiaotong Wang\nMark Watson\nBrenda Willis\nDavid Woken\nAnnie Zeidman-Karpinski\n84  Representative Documents: Library Diversity Goals, Values, Statements\nUNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LIBRARIES\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Libraries Diversity Statement\nhttp://guides.library.upenn.edu/ld.php?content_id=20631816\n20140113\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Libraries Diversity Statement\nThe Penn Libraries seek to support the educational and scholarly endeavors of the Penn \ncommunity both locally and wherever students, faculty, and staff may be located around \nthe world.

Measurements and Standards \n \n \nAssumptions and Standards \n \n• The concept of “diversity” extends well beyond race and sex, and the \nuniversity is committed to collecting and disseminating a greater variety of \ndiversity data in addition to these categories, but in reflection of our legal \nobligations to collect and report data about race and sex, metrics relating to \nthese specific concepts are very commonly used.  \n \n• While it may be important to describe the actions a unit has undertaken \npursuant to a given diversity initiative, assessment should rely primarily on \ndata from or about constituent populations. \n \n• Wherever possible, the efficacy of diversity initiatives should be assessed \nin light of centrally-maintained institutional data and widely-accepted \ndefinitions of key concepts, systematically measured and contextualized. \nThis practice facilitates internal comparisons (such as across units at Cornell) \nand external bench-marking (such as with peer universities).   \n \n• It most cases, comparisons should be made as percentages and with \nreference to the populations and pools most relevant to a given constituency.  \n \nInstitutional Support and Unit Responsibility \n \n• The public Diversity Dashboard and the secured-access Executive \nDiversity Dashboard are resources that facilitate the examination of \ndiversity by sex and race/ethnicity among Cornell constituencies. \n \n• While there are centralized resources (such as Institutional Research & \nPlanning and the Department of Inclusion & Workforce Diversity) that may \n107SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nCORNELL UNIVERSITY \nToward New Destinations 2016–2017.

The use of qualitative data sources, such as \nfocus group or structured interviews, used in conjunction with quantitative \nmeasures can provide a fuller assessment. \n   \n \n \n \n108  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements \nFLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY\nDiversity & Inclusion\nhttp://hr.fsu.edu/?page=diversity/diversity_home\n109SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nUNIVERSITY OF KANSAS\nDiversity Action Plan — Call for Comments\nhttps://provost.ku.edu/diversity-and-inclusion-action-steps\n110  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements \nUNIVERSITY OF KANSAS\nDiversity Action Plan — Call for Comments\nhttps://provost.ku.edu/diversity-and-inclusion-action-steps\n111SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nUNIVERSITY OF KANSAS\nDiversity Action Plan — Call for Comments\nhttps://provost.ku.edu/diversity-and-inclusion-action-steps\n112  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements \nUNIVERSITY OF KANSAS\nDiversity Action Plan — Call for Comments\nhttps://provost.ku.edu/diversity-and-inclusion-action-steps\n113SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nMASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY \nInstitute Community & Equity Office \nhttp://diversity.mit.edu/\n114  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements \nNATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION\nDiversity and Inclusion Program\nhttps://www.archives.gov/eeo/policy/diversity-inclusion-policy-statement.html\n115SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\nPolicy\nhttps://www.edi.nih.gov/policy/about\n116  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements \nUNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA-LINCOLN \nOur Core Values & Beliefs\nhttp://diversity.unl.edu/our-core-values-beliefs\n117SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO \nPresident’s Statement on Diversity and Inclusion\nhttp://www.president.utoronto.ca/presidents-statement-on-diversity-and-inclusion\n118  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements \nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO \nStatement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence\nhttp://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/\nPDF/ppdec142006.pdf\nFile under:  E  Web name:  Equity, Diversity and Excellence, Statement on [December 14, 2006] Official name:  Statement on Equity, \nDiversity, and Excellence [December 14, 2006]  Location: \nhttps://share.utorcsi.utoronto.ca/sites/gc/Governing%20Council/All%20Policies/E/statement%20on%20equity,%20diversity%20and%2\n0excellence.docx   [Official update: December 14, 2006][Last unofficial update:  January 14, 2015] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUniversity of Toronto \nGoverning Council \n \n \nStatement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence \n \n \n \nDecember 14, 2006 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTo request an official copy of this policy, contact: \nThe Office of the Governing Council \nRoom 106, Simcoe Hall \n27 King’s College Circle \nUniversity of Toronto \nToronto, Ontario \nM5S 1A1 \n \nPhone: 416-978-6576 \nFax: 416-978-8182 \nE-mail: governing.council@utoronto.ca \nWebsite: http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/ \n119SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion\nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO \nStatement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence\nhttp://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/\nPDF/ppdec142006.pdf\nStatement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence December 14, 2006 \nUniversity of Toronto Governing Council—Web version 2 \n \n \n \n \nStatement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence \nThe purposes of this statement are to express the University’s values regarding equity and diversity, and \nrelate these to the institution’s unwavering commitment to excellence in the pursuit of our academic \nmission. \n \nEquity and Human Rights \n \nAt the University of Toronto, we strive to be an equitable and inclusive community, rich with diversity, \nprotecting the human rights of all persons, and based upon understanding and mutual respect for the \ndignity and worth of every person. We seek to ensure to the greatest extent possible that all students and \nemployees enjoy the opportunity to participate as they see fit in the full range of activities that the \nUniversity offers, and to achieve their full potential as members of the University community. \n \nOur support for equity is grounded in an institution-wide commitment to achieving a working, teaching, \nand learning environment that is free of discrimination and harassment as defined in the Ontario Human \nRights Code. In striving to become an equitable community, we will also work to eliminate, reduce or \nmitigate the adverse effects of any barriers to full participation in University life that we find, including \nphysical, environmental, attitudinal, communication or technological. \n \nDiversity and Inclusiveness \n \nOur teaching, scholarship and other activities take place in the context of a highly diverse society. \nReflecting this diversity in our own community is uniquely valuable to the University as it contributes to \nthe diversification of ideas and perspectives and thereby enriches our scholarship, teaching and other \nactivities. We will proactively seek to increase diversity among our community members, and it is our aim \nto have a student body and teaching and administrative staffs that mirror the diversity of the pool of \npotential qualified applicants for those positions. \n \nExcellence \n \nWe believe that excellence flourishes in an environment that embraces the broadest range of people, that \nhelps them to achieve their full potential, that facilitates the free expression of their diverse perspectives \nthrough respectful discourse, and in which high standards are maintained for students and staff alike. An \nequitable and inclusive working and learning environment creates the conditions for our diverse staff and \nstudent body to maximize their creativity and their contributions, thereby supporting excellence in all \ndimensions of the institution. \n \nExcellence at the University of Toronto is predicated on core freedoms that are at the heart of every \nuniversity’s mission --- freedom of speech and expression, academic freedom and freedom of research. \n \nResponsibility \n \nThe creation of an equitable community, one that is diverse as well as inclusive and that is respectful and \nprotects the human rights of its members, requires the work of every member of the community, across all \nof our sites and campuses, including students, teaching staff, administrative staff, visitors, alumni and \nguests. \n \nFor its part, the University will strive to make considerations of equity a part of the processes of setting \npolicies, developing procedures, and making decisions at all levels of the institution. While for governance \npurposes, responsibility for the Statement resides with the Vice-President of Human Resources and Equity, \ndaily responsibility for ensuring that the values expressed in this Statement live and breathe throughout the \nUniversity will also rest with the President, the Vice-President and Provost, the Vice-Presidents and Vice- \nProvosts, and each Principal, Dean, Chair and Manager, within the scope of each person’s role in the \nUniversity. \n120  Representative Documents: Institution Diversity Goals, Values, Statements \nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO \nStatement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence\nhttp://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/\nPDF/ppdec142006.pdf\nStatement on Equity, Diversity, and Excellence December 14, 2006 \nUniversity of Toronto Governing Council-Web version 3 \n \n \n \n \nThe University is committed to its internal policies on issues related to equity, and also operates in \ncompliance with all legislation that bears on equity and human rights.1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 The applicable policies and legistation include:  Statement  of Institutional  Purpose, Code of Behaviour on Academic \nMatters, Policies and Procedures: Sexual Harrassment, Employment  Equity Policy, Statement of Commitment \nRegarding  Persons with Disabilities,  Statement  on Protection  of Freedom of Speech, the Ontario Human Rights Code, \nand any current or future guideline or procedure  dealing with equity issues.

    "abstract": "Today, diversity is defined beyond racial and ethnic groups and includes gender, sexual orientation, ability, language, religious belief, national origin, age, and ideas. The increase of published literature about cultural competencies, microaggressions, and assessment of diversity issues, as well as the inclusion of social justice movements in libraries, suggests diversity-related activities have increased and evolved over the last seven years. Over this time span, several libraries have obtained funding to support strategies to increase the number of minority librarians on their staff and support their advancement within the organization. There also appears to be an increase in the number of diversity or multicultural groups at the local, state, and national levels. However, these changes have not been consistently documented. Therefore, it is important to re-examine this topic to evaluate the impact of evolving endeavors, to see if more ARL libraries are involved, to see how diversity plans have changed over the years, and to document the current practices of research libraries. The main purpose of this survey was to identify diversity trends and changes in managing diversity issues in ARL libraries through exploring the components of diversity plans and initiatives since 2010, acknowledge library efforts since the 1990s, provide evidence of best practices and future trends, and identify current strategies that increase the number of minority librarians in research libraries and the types of programs that foster a diverse workplace and climate. The survey was conducted between May 1 and June 5, 2017. Sixty-eight of the 124 ARL member institutions responded to the survey for a 55% response rate. Interestingly, only 22 of the respondents to the 2010 SPEC survey participated in this survey, but this provides an opportunity to explore the diversity and inclusion efforts of a new set of institutions in addition to seeing what changes those 22 institutions have made since 2010.\nThe SPEC Survey on Diversity and Inclusion was designed by Toni Anaya, Instruction Coordinator, and Charlene Maxey-Harris, Research and Instructional Services Chair, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These results are based on responses from 68 of the 124 ARL member libraries (55%) by the deadline of June 12, 2017. The survey’s introductory text and questions are reproduced below, followed by the response data and selected comments from the respondents.\nThe purpose of this survey is to explore the components of diversity plans created since 2010, identify current recruitment and retention strategies that aim to increase the number of minority librarians in research libraries, identify staff development programs that foster an inclusive workplace and climate, identify how diversity programs have changed, and gather information on how libraries assess these efforts",
