Bauer1*, Ayden I. Scheim1, Jake Pyne2, Robb Travers3 and Rebecca Hammond4AbstractBackground: Across Europe, Canada, and the United States, 22–43 % of transgender (trans) people report a historyof suicide attempts. We aimed to identify intervenable factors (related to social inclusion, transphobia, or sex/gender transition) associated with reduced risk of past-year suicide ideation or attempt, and to quantify the potentialpopulation health impact.Methods: The Trans PULSE respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey collected data from trans people age 16+ inOntario, Canada, including 380 who reported on suicide outcomes. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logisticregression models were weighted using RDS II methods. Counterfactual risk ratios and population attributablerisks were estimated using model-standardized risks.Results: Among trans Ontarians, 35.1 % (95 % CI: 27.6, 42.5) seriously considered, and 11.2 % (95 % CI: 6.0, 16.4)attempted, suicide in the past year. Social support, reduced transphobia, and having any personal identificationdocuments changed to an appropriate sex designation were associated with large relative and absolute reductions insuicide risk, as was completing a medical transition through hormones and/or surgeries (when needed). Parentalsupport for gender identity was associated with reduced ideation. Lower self-reported transphobia (10th versus 90thpercentile) was associated with a 66 % reduction in ideation (RR = 0.34, 95 % CI: 0.17, 0.67), and an additional76 % reduction in attempts among those with ideation (RR = 0.24; 95 % CI: 0.07, 0.82). This corresponds to potentialprevention of 160 ideations per 1000 trans persons, and 200 attempts per 1,000 with ideation, based on a hypotheticalreduction of transphobia from current levels to the 10th percentile.Conclusions: Large effect sizes were observed for this controlled analysis of intervenable factors, suggesting thatinterventions to increase social inclusion and access to medical transition, and to reduce transphobia, have thepotential to contribute to substantial reductions in the extremely high prevalences of suicide ideation and attemptswithin trans populations. Such interventions at the population level may require policy change.Keywords: Social exclusion, Transgender, Transsexual, Suicide, Suicidal behaviour, Social determinants of health,Transphobia* Correspondence: greta.bauer@schulich.uwo.ca1Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, TheUniversity of Western Ontario, London, CanadaFull list of author information is available at the end of the article© 2015 Bauer et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 2 of 15BackgroundTrans (transgender or transsexual) people, who may repre-sent up to 0.5 % of the adult population [1], have an ex-tremely high prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts.Studies in Canada, Europe, and the United States havereported suicide attempt prevalences within the trans popu-lation that range from 22 to 43 % over the lifetime and 9 to10 % for the past year [2–7]. In contrast, 3.7 % of all Canadians had seriously considered [8], and 0.6 % attempted[9], suicide in the past year. While completed suicide ratesamong trans people are unknown [10], a history ofattempted suicide is the strongest predictor of completedsuicide across multiple populations [11]. Demographic fac-tors predictive of suicide attempts in the Canadian popula-tion overall include female sex, youth, chronic illness, lackof religiosity, and being unmarried [9]. These predictorsmay not hold within trans populations; for instance, amongtrans Ontarians, ideation and attempts did not differ bygender identity [2]. Moreover, while identification of demo-graphic risk factors is helpful for targeting interventions,they are largely non-modifiable. There is an urgent need toidentify intervenable risk and protective factors [12].To date, most trans suicide research has been descrip-tive, or has assessed predictors of any lifetime suicide at-tempts [6, 7, 13]. This limits applicability of results tosuicide prevention, because predictors of lifetime versusrecent suicide risk, and of ideation versus attempts, maydiffer. Other studies have focused on patients seeking carefor medical transition [14, 15], who are not representativeof the entire trans population [16]. Recent longitudinalstudies demonstrate reductions in psychological distressfollowing medical transition [17, 18]. Therefore, barriersto accessing transition-related care [19] may contribute toincreased suicide ideation and attempts. However, amongthose who have had hormonal treatment and/or sex re-assignment surgery, suicide attempts and deaths remainelevated relative to the broader population [15, 20]. Thus,it appears that factors other than gender dysphoria (dis-tress or discomfort with one’s natal sex) contribute to in-creased suicide risk in trans populations.While not all trans people experience profound dis-tress regarding their embodiment, they nearly universallyreport some degree of social exclusion and transphobia[21]. Trans people are subjected to invisibility in institu-tional settings [22], high levels of discrimination and re-jection [21, 23], harassment and violence [24–26], andpoverty [7, 27]. Trans-related social exclusion has beenassociated with increased lifetime and past-year suicideattempts [2, 6, 28], while social and family support appearto be protective [2, 29]. Determinants of suicide risk in thebroader population, including depression, substance mis-use, and poverty [9, 10] are also elevated among trans per-sons [6, 30, 31], but are consistently attributed to socialexclusion and victimization [23, 25, 28, 32, 33]. Socialexclusion, victimization, and trauma have been identifiedas key contributors to suicide disparities across marginal-ized populations, including sexual minorities [34–38] andIndigenous peoples [38–41].The current study sought to identify intervenable so-cial factors associated with suicide risk reduction fortrans people.Theoretical modelWe present a conceptual model (Fig. 1) for two outcomes:past-year serious consideration of suicide, and – amongthose considering – past-year attempt. This approachreflected the possibility that factors impacting ideationand attempts may differ, as well as the pragmatic desire toboth prevent suicidal ideation and to inform crisis inter-ventions among those who are suicidal.Variables were included as socio-demographic or back-ground factors for the following reasons: 1) they are notamenable to change through intervention in our studypopulation, either because they are unchangeable or be-cause they occurred prior to age 16; 2) they are unlikelyto be a result of the intervenable factors in the model,and 3) they are known or hypothesized to be associatedwith suicide ideation or attempts. Background factorsmust be controlled for as confounders in order to ex-plore the impact of intervenable factors, so that differ-ences observed for other factors are not based simply ondifferences in socio-demographic composition, illness, orhistory of childhood abuse.Variables representing modifiable factors that may betargeted by potential interventions for suicide preventionwithin trans populations fell within three major con-structs: social inclusion, transphobia (including enactedand internalized stigma, as well as violent victimization),and sex/gender transition. Their roles reflect minoritystress [42], as they represent discrimination or accept-ance, inclusion or exclusion, and barriers to full socialparticipation. Moreover, all thirteen intervenable factorsare social or medical determinants of health that are poten-tially intervenable through policy, social and/or medicalintervention, but suggest different strategies. Thus, they areconsidered individually in this analysis rather than as over-all constructs. For example, within the construct of socialinclusion, interventions designed to increase parental sup-port for gender identity or expression (e.g., family therapy,social media campaigns) would differ from those to in-crease identity document concordance (e.g., policy changeon requirements for sex designation changes (or re-moval of sex designations altogether) at the federal andstate/provincial levels).Interventions on these factors have the potential toimpact suicide ideation and attempts through multiplepathways. Suicide researchers have proposed models ofsuicidal behaviour, which focus on proximal determinantsFig. 1 Conceptual model of intervenable social inclusion, transphobia and transition-related factors for suicide prevention among transgenderpeople in Ontario, CanadaBauer et al. BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 3 of 15of ideation and attempts. Prominent among them isJoiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide [43, 44], which ac-counts for a wide range of known risk factors for suicidalbehaviour via three primary constructs. Suicide ideation isattributed to thwarted belongingness (resulting from so-cial isolation) and perceived burdensomeness (e.g., result-ing from family conflict or illness), and acquired capabilityis required for suicidal ideation to engender suicidal intentand attempts. The capability to overcome the natural dis-inclination to physical pain and death is acquired throughprevious exposure to fear and/or pain. Distal factors areposited to increase suicide risk by contributing to theseproximal constructs [44]. Such distal factors are the focusof our analysis, but we include proximal factors in Fig. 1to explicate this conceptualization. Similarly, given the fre-quency of transphobic experiences [21] and their pro-found effects on depression [30–32], housing [45], andaccess to services [22], we also included most of the vari-ables traditionally defined as psychosocial risk factors asproximal factors. Together, these may mediate the effectsof transphobia and other intervenable variables on idea-tion and/or attempts through a multitude of possiblepathways that may be explored in future research.MethodsStudy sampleData were collected via respondent-driven sampling(RDS) in 2009–2010 as part of the Trans PULSE Project,a community-based research study in Ontario, Canada’smost populous province. To be eligible, participants hadto live, work or receive health care in Ontario, be age 16or over, and identify as trans, broadly defined. Partici-pants held a range of gender identities and were not re-quired to have begun a social or medical sex/gendertransition.RDS is a method that combines systematic chain-referralsampling with statistical analysis strategies that accountfor differential levels of connectedness as well as non-independence within recruitment chains. This methodwas chosen as trans persons in Ontario were at leastBauer et al. BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 4 of 15moderately networked, either in person or electronic-ally, but constituted a hidden population that could notbe randomly sampled. Moreover, given the lack of dataon trans people, there was community motivation toparticipate, including to recruit others. Sampling beganwith 16 initial seeds, with 22 additional seeds enrolledonce it was certain that sufficient recruitment chainlength could be obtained. Each participant could recruitadditional participants using a tracked coupon system,wherein three coupons were issued to each participantfor distribution to eligible individuals. This allowed the re-search team to identify the network structure (i.e., who re-cruited whom) while allowing participants to remainanonymous if desired. Data collection continued for oneyear (n = 433), with a maximum chain length of ten waves.A network diagram of the sample is presented in Fig. 2.Our analysis is based on 380 participants (87.8 %) whocompleted items on past-year suicide ideation andattempts. Ethics approval for the project was providedby Research Ethics Boards at The University of WesternOntario and Wilfrid Laurier University.Survey and measuresMeasures were derived from self-report data collectedthrough a multi-mode survey (with visually identical onlineor paper versions), which could be completed anonymouslyFig. 2 Network diagram of sample of trans people in Ontario, Canada (n =individuals.

The survey was pre-tested by 16 members of the project’s Community Engage-ment Team for content validity, clarity and length. A copyof the survey is available online (http://transpulsepro-ject.ca/resources/trans-pulse-survey/).OutcomesPast-year suicidal ideation was coded from items thatasked participants “Have you ever seriously consideredcommitting suicide or taking your own life?” and “If yes,has this happened in the past 12 months?” Similarfollow-up questions for those who indicated ideationasked “Have you ever attempted to commit suicide ortried taking your own life?” and “If yes, did this happenin the past 12 months?”Background variablesAge, disability status, parental status, and chronic illness/pain were indicated by participant self-report. Genderspectrum was coded into two categories that each rep-resent a spectrum of identities. Female-to-male spec-trum individuals were those assigned female at birth, butwho now identify as men or another non-female identity(e.g., genderqueer, bigender); similarly, male-to-femalespectrum participants were those assigned male at birthwho now identify as women, trans girls, two-spirit, or other433).

Gender fluidity was coded as a separatedichotomous measure from a check-all-that-apply identityitem into two categories: holding a more conventional gen-der identity (male or primarily masculine, female or primar-ily feminine), or only gender-fluid or third-gender identities.Ethno-racial group was comprised of three groups: partici-pants were grouped as Aboriginal if they indicated theywere First Nations, Métis, or Inuit, or another Indigenousethnicity; non-Aboriginal participants were classified aswhite or racialized based on an ethno-racial backgrounditem, a write-in question describing background, and indica-tion as to whether or not they were perceived by others as aperson of colour. In Ontario, the term “racialized” is pre-ferred over racial minority, visible minority, person of colouror non-White as it expresses race as a social construct ra-ther than a description on perceived biological traits” [46].Immigration history was approximated by self-report ofwhether the participant was born in Canada. Sexual orienta-tion was coded as sexual minority based on either identifica-tion as gay, lesbian or bisexual/pansexual, or having a past-year sex partner of the same gender. Region of province wasclassified based on first letter of postal code. Strong religiousupbringing was defined as responding “quite” or “extremely”to the question “How religious or faith-based was your up-bringing?” Childhood abuse prior to age 16 was indicated intwo items describing physical and sexual abuse experiences.Major mental health disorders were coded using a self-reported checklist based on any prior diagnosis (e.g., bipolardisorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder).Depression and anxiety disorders were excluded, as they aremore likely to result from intervenable factors under study,and we hypothesized they would partially mediate their ef-fects on suicide ideation or attempt; if we were to controlfor these mediators we would then remove a portion of thecausal effect and would produce estimates for the effects ofour intervenable factors as enacted only through pathwaysother than depression or anxiety.Intervenable variables – social inclusionSocial support was assessed using the 19-item MedicalOutcomes Study Social Support Scale [47]. Items wereaveraged, with possible scale values from 1 to 5 (Cron-bach α = 0.97). Strong support for gender was coded forparticipants’ parents by combining self-report of either“very strong” support for gender identity or expressionexperienced from a parent or parents, or (for those whowere not out to their parents) self-report of expectationof such support. Other gender support variables weresimilarly coded. “Peers” averaged completed items onfriends, co-workers, or classmates, and “Leaders” onschools, teachers, supervisors or employers. Current re-ligiosity or spirituality was measured on a 6-point Likertscale ranging from “not at all” to “extremely”. Havingone or more identity documents concordant with livedgender was coded for the participant sub-group who hadsocially transitioned and lived full-time in a male/masculineor female/feminine gender, based on having at least onedocument with a sex/gender designation (“M” or “F”)matching one’s lived gender. Identity documents includedfederal and provincial identification (e.g. drivers license,passport, Indian Status card, military ID).Intervenable variables –transphobiaTransphobia was assessed using an 11-item scale [21]; itincluded items on enacted and internalized stigma aswell as victimization, such as police harassment or feel-ing that being trans hurt or embarrassed one’s family.Items were summed, with possible values ranging from0 to 33 (Cronbach α = 0.81). Transphobic harassmentand violence was defined as self-report of physical orsexual assault for being trans (analogous to assault as ahate crime); report of verbal harassment or threats re-lated to being trans, but not of assault; and report ofnone of these.Intervenable variables –transitionMedical transition status was self-reported as havingcompleted a medical transition (self-defined), being inthe process, planning to transition but not yet havingbegun, and either not planning, being unsure, or indicat-ing that the concept of “transition” did not apply. Com-pleting a medical transition involved varying hormoneand/or surgical treatments [16]. Hormone use was self-reported. Social transition status was coded as living inone’s felt gender full-time, part-time, or not at all. Beingperceived as cisgender (non-trans) was coded for thoseliving full-time in a non-fluid gender, based on a surveyitem that asked how often others knew you were transwithout being told.Statistical analysisSince eligible trans persons who knew fewer potentialparticipants were less likely to be sampled than thosewith large network sizes, RDS II weights [48] were cal-culated based on the inverse of each participant’s degree(personal network size), rescaled to sum to the totalsample size of 433. This approach has been shown toproduce frequency estimates that are asymptotically un-biased [49]. Here weighted statistics can be interpretedto apply to the population of networked (know at leastone other eligible person) trans people age 16 and overin Ontario. All analyses were weighted, and adjusted for clus-tering by shared recruiter to account for non-independencewithin recruitment chains. Weighted frequencies or means,along with 95 % confidence intervals, were calculated for allbackground and potential intervention variables using SASversion 9.3 [50].Bauer et al. BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 6 of 15Prior to regression, simple imputation was used forbackground variables to reduce data loss in a completecase analysis. Of 380 participants with outcome data, 30were missing data for one background covariate and 5for more than one.Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted foreach intervenable factor variable separately, controllingfor all background variables, using SAS-callable SUDAANversion 11.0 [51]. Thus, 13 logistic regression models werefitted for the 13 intervenable factor variables for the sui-cidal ideation outcome, and an additional 13 models forthe suicide attempt outcome; all models similarly con-trolled for background variables, but not for other inter-venable variables, as mediated pathways between thesevariables are unknown. A domain analysis was used inorder to limit the second analysis to the sample subgroupwith suicidal ideation.All categorical variables were dummy-coded to allow forindependent estimation of effects for each group. Refer-ence categories were chosen so that contrasts reflected ef-fects in the direction of desired potential interventioneffects (e.g., protecting from assault, increasing social sup-port). Continuous variables were entered into the modelsas continuous. Since average marginal risks are estimatedfor specific points in the distribution (as if the entire transpopulation – standardized to the background variables –was at that level), the 10th and 90th percentiles were usedas points for estimation since participant values did notnecessarily cover the range of a scale and the extremesmay not be achievable with any intervention (e.g., notransphobia would require not even having heard oncethat trans people were not normal).Model-standardized risks and risk ratios for past-year suicidal ideation and attempts (standardized tothe weighted sample or subsample on all backgroundfactors) were estimated for each of the thirteen inter-venable variables under the counterfactual conditionswhere all participants were exposed or alternately allwere unexposed to a dichotomous intervenable factor,or to an intervention target and reference level of acategorical factor. For continuous variables, these counter-factual risks were estimated for the 10th and 90th percent-ile levels. Standardized risks and risk ratios, and their 95 %confidence intervals, were calculated by Graubard andKorn’s method [52] using the ADJRR option in SUDAANPROC RLOGIST [51]. Where effects were statistically sig-nificant for a variable, counterfactual population attribut-able risks (cPARs) were then calculated by taking theweighted prevalence of the outcome in the sample (fac-tual) and subtracting the model-standardized risk(counterfactual) based on having the entire populationat intervention target levels of the exposure. These rep-resent the potential proportion of the trans populationaffected (e.g., outcome averted) under the interventiontarget condition (e.g., all have parental support for gen-der). Counterfactual population attributable risk pro-portions (c%PARs) were similarly estimated by dividingcPAR by the weighted prevalence of the outcome in thesample; these represent the proportion of cases poten-tially averted within the trans population. C%PARs fordifferent variables will sum to more than 100 %, giventhat a case of ideation or suicide attempt could be pre-vented through multiple means.ResultsMeans or frequencies for sociodemographics and back-ground covariates are presented in Table 1. Frequenciesfor intervenable variables and past-year suicide ideationand attempt are presented in Table 2. In the past year,35.1 % (95 % CI: 27.6, 42.5) had seriously considered sui-cide, and 11.2 % (95 % CI: 6.0, 16.4) reported that theyhad attempted it.Findings on model-standardized risks are presented inTable 3 for suicide ideation and in Table 4 for suicide at-tempts (among those with ideation), along with model-standardized relative risks and population attributablerisks. Average relative effects on individuals, and at atrans population level, were sometimes strong. Highlevels of social support (90th percentile) versus lowlevels (10th percentile) were significantly associated witha 49 % reduction in suicide ideation (RR = 0.51; 95 % CI:0.28, 0.94), and with a further 82 % reduction in attemptrisk among those with ideation (RR = 0.18; 95 % CI: 0.04,0.73). This would be associated with potential preven-tion of 100 cases of ideation per 1,000 trans persons(cPAR = 0.10), and a further prevention of 220 attemptsper 1,000 trans persons considering suicide (cPAR =0.22). Among sources of strong support for gender, onlysupport from parents was statistically significantly asso-ciated with reduced risk, with RR = 0.43 (95 % CI: 0.26,0.73) for past-year ideation, and no additional statisti-cally significant effect on the risk of attempts amongthose with ideation. At a population level, this corre-sponds to potential prevention of 170 trans persons per1,000 (cPAR = 0.17) from seriously considering suicide(and thus also reducing the risk of attempt through low-ering the proportion at risk). Interestingly, strong sup-port from leaders such as supervisors or teachers wassignificantly associated with an increased risk of at-tempts among those with ideation (RR = 5.24; 95 % CI:2.20, 12.46). Having one or more identity documentsconcordant with lived gender was significantly associatedwith reductions in past-year ideation (RR = 0.56; 95 %CI: 0.35, 0.90) and attempts (RR = 0.26, 95 % CI: 0.11,0.62), with the potential to prevent 90 cases of ideationper 1,000 trans persons (cPAR = 0.09), and 230 attemptsper 1,000 with ideation (cPAR = 0.23). Religiosity wasnot associated with suicidality.Table 1 Weighted background characteristics of trans people inOntario, Canada (n=380)Background variablesn = 380% or \u0001x 95 % CIAge, years \u0001xð Þ 32.7 (30.5, 35.0)Gender spectrum (%)Female-to-male spectrum 52.6 (44.4, 60.8)Male-to-female spectrum 47.4 (39.2, 55.6)Gender fluidity (%)Primarily fluid or third gender identity 17.7 (11.3, 24.1)Primarily masculine or feminine identity 82.3 (75.9, 88.7)Ethnoracial group (%)Aboriginal 6.6 (3.2, 9.9)Non-Aboriginal white 77.3 (71.0, 83.6)Non-Aboriginal racialized 16.1 (10.6, 21.7)Place of birth (%)Canada 80.3 (74.1, 86.6)Outside of Canada 19.7 (13.4, 25.9)Sexual orientation (%)Lesbian, gay, bisexual or MSM/WSW 66.7 (59.2, 74.2)Straight 33.3 (25.8, 40.8)Region of residence (%)Southeastern Ontario 10.8 (5.9, 15.7)South Central Ontario 16.4 (10.1, 22.7)Metropolitan Toronto 38.3 (30.3, 46.3)Southwestern Ontario 27.2 (18.7, 35.8)Northern Ontario 7.3 (2.9, 11.6)Visual, hearing, communication or mobility disability (%) 12.4 (8.2, 16.7)Parental status (young or grown children) (%) 25.6 (18.2, 32.9)Strong religious upbringing (%) 23.7 (16.8, 30.7)Childhood physical or sexual abuse (%) 70.7 (63.5, 78.0)Major mental health disorder (%) 19.1 (13.4, 24.7)Living with chronic illness or chronic pain (%) 18.0 (12.1, 23.9)Table 2 Means or frequencies of intervenable variables (socialsupport, transphobia, and transition) and suicidality among transpeople in Ontario, Canada (n=380)n = 380% or \u0001x 95 % CISocial SupportSocial support \u0001xð Þ 3.5 (3.3, 3.6)Strong parental support for gender (%)a 28.5 (21.6, 35.4)Strong family support for gender (%)a 60.5 (52.2, 68.7)Strong support from leaders (%)a 47.4 (38.1, 56.8)Strong support from peers (%)a 86.1 (80.3, 91.9)Religiosity or spirituality \u0001xð Þ 3.0 (2.7, 3.3)Having ≥1 ID concordant with lived gender (%)b 51.1 (41.8, 60.5)TransphobiaTransphobia scale \u0001xð Þ 14.1 (13.0, 15.1)Transphobic violence (%)None 44.0 (35.6, 52.3)Verbal harassment or threats 34.9 (27.5, 42.2)Physical or sexual assault 21.2 (15.0, 27.3)TransitionMedical transition status (%)cCompleted 35.3 (27.6, 42.9)In process 31.8 (24.6, 39.0)Planning, but not begun 32.9 (24.9, 40.9)Social transition status (%)Full-time 53.3 (44.7, 61.9)Part-time 26.9 (19.8, 34.1)Not living in core gender 19.8 (12.1, 27.4)Current hormone use (%)c 57.6 (49.1, 66.1)Being socially seen as cisgender (%)bAlmost always or always 45.5 (35.3, 55.6)About half time or often 25.5 (17.7, 33.2)Rarely or never 29.0 (19.7, 38.4)SuicidalitySeriously considered suicide, past yr (%) 35.1 (27.6, 42.5)Attempted suicide, past yr (%) 11.2 (6.0, 16.4)aSupport variables include either indication of – or expectation of –strong supportbamong those living full-time in a non-fluid gender (n = 251)camong those reporting need to medically transition sex (n = 346)Bauer et al. BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 7 of 15Both transphobia variables in the analysis were associ-ated with ideation and attempts, with lower transphobiaassociated with reduced risk. Lower overall transphobia(10th percentile vs. 90th) was statistically significantly as-sociated with a 66 % relative risk reduction of past-yearideation (RR = 0.34; 95 % CI: 0.17, 0.67) and an add-itional 76 % relative risk reduction (RR = 0.24; 95 % CI:0.07, 0.82) for attempts. This represents a potential pre-vention of 160 cases of ideation per 1,000 trans persons(cPAR = 0.16), and potential prevention of 200 attemptsper 1,000 with ideation (cPAR = 0.20).Medical transition variables, but not social transitionor being perceived as cisgender, were associated withsuicidality. Among those who desired medical transition,those on hormone therapy were about half as likely tohave seriously considered suicide (RR = 0.52; 95 % CI:0.37, 0.75).

BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 12 of 15process, vs. completing. However, among the sub-groupwith ideation, being in the process of transitioning wassignificantly associated with increased risk of an attempt(RR = 2.91; 95 % CI: 1.48, 5.76) in comparison with thosewho were planning to transition but had not yet begun.We did not observe an increased risk in this sub-groupamong those who completed a medical transition (RR =0.51; 0.07, 3.74). Completing a medical transition hadbeneficial individual and population effects. It was asso-ciated with a 62 % relative risk reduction (RR = 0.38;95 % CI: 0.22, 0.66) in ideation. On a trans populationlevel, to facilitate completion of medical transition(when desired) would correspond to preventing 170cases of ideation per year per 1,000 trans persons(cPAR = 0.17), representing 44 % of ideation (c%PAR =0.44), and further preventing 240 attempts per 1,000with ideation (cPAR = 0.24) or 69 % of attempts in thisgroup (c%PAR = 0.69).DiscussionOur findings provide evidence that social inclusion (socialsupport, gender-specific support from parents, identitydocuments), protection from transphobia (interpersonal,violence), and undergoing medical transition have the po-tential for sizeable effects on the high rates of suicide idea-tion and attempts in trans communities. In contrast, wedid not find statistically significant effects for social transi-tion, gender support from sources other than parents, orreligiosity/spirituality, other than an unexpected finding re-garding strong gender support from leaders. Given that stat-istical power was not high, as evidenced by the width of ourconfidence intervals, a lack of statistical significance doesnot mean that these other factors should be dismissed, assmaller effects may exist below the threshold for detection.Our results provide support for the potentially strong im-pact of trans-specific discrimination or harassment (e.g., ex-periences of transphobia), interpersonal factors (e.g., strongparental support for gender identity or expression) andstructural factors (e.g., having an identity document with agender marker concordant with one’s lived gender) on sui-cide ideation or attempts. This reinforces our earlier de-scriptive findings that risk of suicide ideation and attemptsvaried greatly among trans people [2], and reinforces theneed to look beyond proximal determinants toward sites ofearly prevention or intervention. It is not clear to whatextent results from this study may also apply to gendernon-conforming cisgender persons, but we note thatamong sexual minority youth, early gender non-conformityhas been associated with increased suicidal behaviour orrisk, a process that may be mediated by gender harassmentor bullying [53–55], or by parental disapproval of genderexpression [55].The large effect sizes observed support the possibilityfor preventing suicidal ideation and attempts in a largenumber of individuals. Using the transphobia results asan example, combining the population effects of a re-duction in ideation and a reduction in attempt riskamong the reduced cases of ideation, and given a popu-lation estimate of 53,500 trans adults in Ontario [26], wewould estimate that reducing experiences of transphobiacould prevent 8,560 trans persons in the province fromexperiencing suicidal ideation and 4,601 persons from asuicide attempt within a year.Our results represent the most detailed analysis of thisissue to date; our study was based on a respondent-driven sample of trans people from a large provincialgeographic area. The analysis takes account of differen-tial probability of recruitment related to differences innetwork size, but other biases unrelated to network sizemay remain [56]. Our use of past-year suicide-relatedmeasures represents an improvement over studies thatused lifetime measures, as we are able to analyse impacton recent or current risk, which is most relevant to pre-vention. However, temporality remains a concern. It ispossible that some potential causes occurring in the pastyear followed rather than preceded the outcome. This isone potential explanation of the unusual finding of sup-port from a leader (teacher, supervisor, institution) beingassociated with increased suicide attempts among thosewith ideation, in that an attempt may trigger the involve-ment of leaders. Moreover, as we were unable to deter-mine the exact sequences of events for each participant,it is likely that we have partially controlled for some me-diating effects or not controlled for some confounding.For example, borderline personality disorder is adjustedfor as a confounder, though it is possible that for someparticipants its etiology includes experiences of trans-phobia such as those we assess, and it may thus play amediating role. Despite these limitations, we attemptedto address temporality within a cross-sectional designthrough time designations within questionnaire items(e.g., childhood abuse prior to the age for inclusion inthis study) and use of past-year outcomes.Our finding that completing a medical transition wasassociated with reduced risk has implications for inter-pretation of existing studies on completed suicides. Be-cause trans people are not identifiable in death records,and because completed suicides may occur among thosewho know they are trans but are not known by familymembers to be trans, valid studies of completed suicideshave only been done where patient records from genderclinics have been matched to population death records(e.g., in Sweden [15]). Our results suggest these esti-mates of completed suicide among those who have med-ically transitioned likely underestimate the risk of suicideamong broader trans communities.As all surveys are, by definition, studies of survivors,survival bias remains an issue. Frequencies for attemptsBauer et al. BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 13 of 15will likely be underestimated. Factors that predict lethal-ity may be missed, if those who completed suicide differfrom those who survived attempts. Given that weassessed suicide attempts only among those who indi-cated past-year serious consideration, our data may alsohave missed additional attempts that were impulsive andunplanned. Moreover, past-year prevalence may not rep-resent a first incident of suicide ideation or attempt;thus, this analysis cannot distinguish between factorsthat lead one to first become suicidal versus to continuebeing suicidal.Proximal factors theorized and demonstrated to in-crease risk of suicide ideation and/or attempts (e.g., riskfactors from epidemiological research and interpersonalfactors from Joiner’s Interpersonal Model [43]) wereconceptualized as mediators, but not included in theseanalyses. Moreover, our analysis could not disaggregateeffects of intervenable variables on other intervenablevariables. For example, it is possible that increased par-ental support for gender may affect whether or notsomeone is able to medically transition; it is also possiblethat medical transition results in increased parental sup-port for gender, as parents are able to more clearly seetheir child in their felt gender. These areas representopportunities for future research. In general, suicideresearch regarding gender and sexual minorities hastended to overlook existing theoretical frameworkswithin suicidology [57], though they are not incompat-ible with other frameworks or methods. Future researchwith trans populations could draw on interdisciplinarytheories as well as evidence from trans-specific andbroader population research on suicide ideation and at-tempts to study mediated pathways.Future prospective cohort studies of broadly definedtrans populations are needed to alleviate many of thelimitations of this and other studies. With prospectivedata, we may be able to differentiate between factorsthat cause initial ideation and factors that prolong itsduration, as well as those that lead to first and repeatedattempts. We could also begin to study completed sui-cides in a non-clinical trans population, at least amongthose who are willing to identify as trans to researchers.Moreover, with clear information on temporality, wewould be able to design better controlled and more validanalyses, and to examine mediated pathways (includingpathways between intervenable factors as well as prox-imal factors) to better understand the process throughwhich social marginalization may impact suicide ideationand attempt.Our goal of evaluating intervenable factors should beinterpreted as a screening of potential strategies ratherthan an analysis of actual population intervention effects.While background factors are structured to representthose that are in the past, unchangeable, or not likely tochange in response to other factors in the model, our ana-lytic approach then considers intervenable factors singly;it was not possible to tease apart causal pathways amongthese factors and combining them into one model wouldby default serve to prioritize the proximal causal factorswhile reducing the effect sizes of other potentially import-ant causes [58] (a general effect of multivariable modelsthat is not often explicated but is commonly understoodwith regard to control for a mediator reducing a causaleffect [59, 60]). Depending upon inter-individual vari-ation, as in all individual-level studies, also results in aninability to detect simultaneous effects at the grouplevel [61]. For example, reducing transphobic assaultsfrom the current prevalence of 21.2 to 0 % may affectsuicide risk not only by saving individuals from thetrauma of hate-based assault, but may have additionaleffects on these individuals and others based on livingin a society where transphobic assaults do not occur,versus where they are common.ConclusionsOur findings support a strong effect for social exclusion,discrimination and lack of medical transition (for thoseneeding it) on suicide ideation and attempts, and poten-tially on the survival of trans persons. This adds supportto the larger discussion regarding social impacts on sui-cide risk in groups experiencing marginalization, suchas Indigenous communities and sexual minorities. Ourteam has previously published recommendations forsuicide prevention efforts with trans persons, based ondescriptive analyses of these data [2]. The present analysisprovides stronger support for those recommendations, in-cluding attention to social support and protection fromdiscrimination, by showing that these effects remain afteradjusting for potential confounding by background. It alsosuggests additional targets for intervention. Specifically,while gender recognition is recognized as a human rightfor trans people in Ontario [62], we have provided the firstevidence of its potential to reduce suicidality. Since ourdata were collected, the surgical requirement for changingthe sex/gender designation on an Ontario birth certificatehas been eliminated. Such legal and policy changes can beconsidered public health interventions worthy of longer-term evaluation. In addition, parental support has beenpreviously associated with reduced suicide risk for sexualminority [63] and trans [64] youth, but our results demon-strate the importance of parental support for gender iden-tity among adults, suggesting a need for all-ages familyinterventions. Finally, we found that among those report-ing a need to medically transition through hormones and/or surgeries, suicidality was substantially reduced amongthose who had completed a medical transition (this in-volved varying procedures based on personal needs [16]).Despite potentially large reductions in risk for thoseBauer et al. BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 14 of 15completing medical transition, the period of being inprocess did not represent a clear mid-point in risk. Whilesuicidal ideation was significantly reduced for those inprocess versus those who were planning to transition buthad not begun, among the sub-group considering suicidethe attempt rate was highest among those in process.These results call into question the safety of clinical prac-tices that delay transition treatments until depressivesymptoms or suicidality are well-controlled, and of pro-cedural practices that require or result in long delays inthe medical transition process, but also suggest need forsupports for those who may feel suicidal while in theprocess of transitioning.Our findings strongly suggest that interventions aimedat increasing social inclusion, reducing transphobicdiscrimination and violence, and facilitating access tomedical transition should be considered as part of acomprehensive approach to suicide prevention in transpopulations, and evaluated to assess effectiveness. Such in-terventions need not supplant individual-level or thera-peutic approaches (e.g., psychotherapy, crisis services), buthave the potential to reduce suicide ideation and attemptsby targeting stigma and social exclusion as fundamentalcauses of disparities.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributionsGRB, JP, RT and RH planned and undertook the survey.
