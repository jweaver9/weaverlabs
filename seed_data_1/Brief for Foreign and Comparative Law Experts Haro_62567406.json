Many constitutional democracies with which we share common values have concluded that the exclusion of marriage rights for same-sex couples violates their constitutional principles.  Whether by judicial deci-sions or legislation, these states have embraced marriage rights for same-sex couples based on consti-tutional principles common to the rights protected under the Fourteenth Amendment, including individ-ual liberty, dignity, and equality.   Liberal democracies like ours have made steady and undeniable progress toward full marriage equali-ty.  Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, when a num-ber of European countries created registered partnerships, constitutional democracies have given same-sex couples some of the same rights afforded to married opposite-sex couples.  Since 2001, twenty countries have embraced equal marriage throughout their jurisdictions for reasons that have persuasive force before this Court.   The reasoning of these states’ courts and legisla-tures provides a useful perspective that this Court should consider.  As this Court recognized in Law-rence, fundamental principles such as “liberty,” “dig-nity,” and “equality” are not solely American, but 5 rather universal, concepts whose interpretation by other leading constitutional courts can inform this Court’s understanding of issues.  See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 572-573, 576-577 (2003).  As Justice Breyer has noted, “the way in which foreign courts have applied standards roughly comparable to our own constitutional standards in roughly compa-rable circumstances,” Knight v. Florida, 528 U.S. 990, 997 (1999) (Breyer, J., dissenting), may “cast an empirical light on the consequences of different solutions to a common legal problem,” Printz v. Unit-ed States, 521 U.S. 898, 977 (1997) (Breyer, J., dis-senting).  Significantly, foreign states that permit marriage for same-sex couples have successfully balanced the rights of religious institutions with the rights of couples to take part in civil marriage.  Whatever countervailing “compelling governmental interest” or parade of horribles opponents of equal marriage may have imagined simply have not materialized.    This Court should also recognize the influence its decision may have on the rest of the world.  “When life or liberty is at stake, the landmark judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States, giving fresh meaning to the principles of the Bill of Rights, are studied with as much attention in New Delhi or Strasbourg as they are in Washington, D.C., or the 6 State of Washington, or Springfield, Illinois.”3  Accord-ingly, foreign courts considering human-rights issues have often looked to this Court’s decisions.  For example, Lawrence has been invoked to strike down foreign laws that impinge upon the intimate relations between gay and lesbian couples.  This Court’s deci-sion here will certainly influence the decisions of other liberal democracies that are debating how and when to recognize equal rights for same-sex couples.  Finally, a ruling that States may single out and deny same-sex couples the same marriage rights extended to opposite-sex couples would diminish U.S. leadership in the field of personal freedom and hu-man rights.  The United States has long cherished a deep and abiding reputation as “the world’s foremost protector of liberties.”  United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 285 (1990) (Brennan, J., dissenting).  The Court’s ruling in this case will affect whether the United States continues to be seen as a global leader in the robust defense of personal auton-omy and human dignity.      3 Anthony Lester, The Overseas Trade in the American Bill of Rights, 88 COLUM. L. REV. 537, 541 (1988). 7 ARGUMENT DEVELOPMENTS IN OTHER LIBERAL DE-MOCRACIES CONFIRM THAT LEGAL GUAR-ANTEES OF DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION PRINCIPLES REQUIRE FULL MARRIAGE EQUALITY  This Court does not stand alone in the world.  It is only one of many high courts in a constitutional democracy to consider whether same-sex couples have an equal right to enter into the legal institution of marriage.  Numerous courts from countries that share common legal values with the United States have concluded as a matter of constitutional law that same-sex couples must be afforded full marriage rights.  Those decisions rest upon principles common to our own understanding of the rights protected under the Fourteenth Amendment, including the liberty to make fundamental choices for one’s own life free from government intervention, the dignity and worth of all persons, and equality under the law.  Due process and equal protection are not exclusively American property; they are legal concepts that we share with these other nations.  Accordingly, the decisions from other nations that have wrestled with the same question provide valuable insight into the individual liberty and equality issues at stake in these cases.   8 A. Decisions From Courts Of Other Constitu-tional Democracies Provide This Court With A Useful Comparative Perspective  Just as this Court’s decisions have influenced the jurisprudence of other nations, this Court has long benefitted from understanding how foreign nations that share many of our legal attributes, traditions, and history have confronted similar questions.4  While of course not binding on this Court, “the way in which foreign courts have applied standards roughly comparable to our own constitutional standards in roughly comparable circumstances” may offer con-crete solutions when those issues arise here.  Knight, 528 U.S. at 997 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  As Chief Justice Rehnquist observed more than two decades ago: For nearly a century and a half, courts in the United States exercising the power of judi-cial review had no precedents to look to save their own, because our courts alone exercised this sort of authority.  When many new con-stitutional courts were created after the Se-cond World War, these courts naturally looked to the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, among other sources, for developing their own law.  But now that constitutional law is solidly grounded in so   4 See Sarah H. Cleveland, Our International Constitution, 31 YALE J. INT’L L. 1 (2006); Vicki C. Jackson, CONSTITUTIONAL ENGAGEMENT IN A TRANSNATIONAL ERA (2010). 9 many countries, it is time that the United States courts begin looking to the decisions of other constitutional courts to aid in their own deliberative process. William Rehnquist, Constitutional Courts—Comparative Remarks, in GERMANY AND ITS BASIC LAW: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE—A GERMAN-AMERICAN SYMPOSIUM 411, 412 (Paul Kirchof & Don-ald P. Kommers eds., 1993); see also United States v. Then, 56 F.3d 464, 469 (2d Cir. 1995) (Calabresi, J., concurring) (“These countries are our ‘constitutional offspring’ and how they have dealt with problems analogous to ours can be very useful to us when we face difficult constitutional issues.  Wise parents do not hesitate to learn from their children.”).  This Court has considered foreign and interna-tional law to illuminate, in particular, the rights guaranteed by “due process of law” and “equal protec-tion of the laws.”  U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1.  Constitutional terms like “liberty” and “equality” are universal.  As Justice Frankfurter explained in con-sidering whether a forced confession was constitu-tional in Malinski v. New York, “[t]he safeguards of ‘due process of law’ and ‘the equal protection of the laws’ summarize the history of freedom of English-speaking peoples.”  324 U.S. 401, 413-414 (1945) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., 240 U.S. 342, 366 (1916) (our Constitution embodies “relatively fundamental rules of right, as generally understood by all English-speaking communities”).  10  In Lawrence, this Court consulted comparative and international precedents in overruling Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), and holding unconsti-tutional state laws criminalizing consensual intimacy between persons of the same sex.  The Lawrence Court explained: “To the extent Bowers relied on values we share with a wider civilization, it should be noted that the reasoning and holding in Bowers have been rejected elsewhere.”  539 U.S. at 576.  The Court observed that the “European Court of Human Rights has followed not Bowers but its own decision” and that “[o]ther nations, too, have taken action con-sistent with an affirmation of the protected right of homosexual adults to engage in intimate, consensual conduct.”  Ibid.  As the Court noted, that right “has been accepted as an integral part of human freedom in many other countries.”  Id. at 577.  Indeed, the Court in Lawrence criticized Bowers for making “sweeping references * * * to the history of Western civilization” but “not tak[ing] account of other author-ities pointing in an opposite direction.”  Id. at 572-573.  In turn, foreign judiciaries have increasingly relied on Lawrence as illustrating fundamental standards of human decency.  For example, courts in Hong Kong and Fiji invoked the holding and reason-ing of Lawrence in striking down anti-sodomy laws.  Leung TC William Roy v. Secretary for Justice, [2005] 3 H.K.L.R.D. 657 para. 140 (C.F.I.) (H.K.); McCoskar v. State [2005] FJHC 500 (Fiji). 11  The interaction among courts with respect to Lawrence was just the beginning of what is now a vibrant, interactive conversation across jurisdictions regarding the rights of same-sex couples to live not just free of discrimination but holding the equal status of marriage.5   For example, in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massa-chusetts cited and relied upon the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario to conclude that the common-law meaning of marriage must be refined to include same-sex couples.  798 N.E.2d 941, 969 (Mass. 2003).  In turn, the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa cited Goodridge when holding South Africa’s marriage-exclusion laws unconstitutional, as did Brazil’s Superior Tribunal de Justiça.  Fourie v.

(Braz.).6   Not all legislative and judicial decisions from the world community concerning the recognition of same-sex relationships provide models that this Court should follow.  Decisions from nations that do not share our constitutional values for individual liberty, equality, and dignity may still be useful in that they may provide “anti-models,” i.e., decisions from which this Court should consciously depart.7  For example, in Roper v. Simmons, this Court observed that the only seven countries other than the United States to have executed juvenile offenders since 1990 were states that do not share a common constitutional heritage with us: Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and China.  543 U.S. 551, 577 (2005).  Es-chewing those anti-models, the Court observed that the “United Kingdom’s experience bears particular relevance here in light of the historic ties between our countries.”  Ibid.    6 Available at https://ww2.stj.jus.br/processo/jsp/revista/abre Documento.jsp?componente=ITA&sequencial=1099021&num_ registro=201000366638&data=20120201&formato=PDF.  7 See Sujit Choudhry, The Lochner Era and Comparative Constitutionalism, 2 INT’L J. CONST. L. 1 (2004); Heinz Klug, Model and Anti-Model: The United States Constitution and the “Rise of World Constitutionalism,” 2000 WIS. L. REV. 597 (2000). 13  As demonstrated below, reasoned opinions from other liberal, constitutional democracies have con-cluded that excluding same-sex couples from the fundamental institution of marriage violates core rights of freedom, dignity, and equality.  These deci-sions provide important authority to support the same interpretation of those rights here. B. Foreign Jurisdictions That Have Recog-nized Equal Marriage Rights Confirm That Discrimination Against Same-Sex Couples In Marriage Impermissibly Affronts Fun-damental Notions Of Liberty, Dignity, And Equality 1. A growing number of liberal democra-cies have recognized marriage equality   a. As chronicled in the appendix to this brief, many legal systems throughout the world have now fully embraced equal marriage rights for gay and lesbian people.  Others have taken significant steps on the road toward marriage equality by requiring that same-sex couples be provided legal recognition and protection.  Courts and legislatures that have taken these actions have invoked principles common to our understanding of rights under the Fourteenth Amendment: among them the individual liberty to marry the person of one’s choice, equality under the law, and the unacceptability of denying access to essential institutions based on the gender of a per-son’s chosen life partner.  These decisions offer strong support for this Court to hold that States must both license marriages between individuals of the same 14 sex and recognize marriages between two people of the same sex who were lawfully married in another State.   The progression toward marriage equality began in the 1980s, when a number of European democra-cies began offering limited legal rights for same-sex couples.  App., infra, 1a.  Then in the 1990s, many of these countries formally recognized same-sex couples through registered domestic partnerships or civil unions.  Id. at 1a-2a.  In 2001, the Netherlands—which previously had authorized registered partner-ships for same-sex couples—became the first country to recognize full marriage equality.  Id. at 2a-3a.   Since then, nineteen other countries, many of which had previously granted domestic partnerships or civil unions to same-sex couples, have adopted full marriage equality: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Cana-da, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Iceland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Scot-land, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Uruguay, and Wales.  Id. at 3a-12a.   In addition, Israel recognizes same-sex couples’ marriages performed in other countries, several Mexican states solemnize same-sex marriages, and Vietnam has decriminalized same-sex weddings.  Id. at 10a.  In May 2015, Ireland will vote on a govern-ment-proposed Marriage Equality referendum to amend the constitution to permit same-sex couples to marry.  Id. at 12a.  And the assembly of the Shibuya 15 Ward in Tokyo recently announced plans to vote on providing legal rights to same-sex couples.  Ibid.8   b. In some of these countries, courts ruled that the lack of full marriage privileges for same-sex couples violated fundamental constitutional rights.  When the legislatures in these countries ultimately implemented those high-court decisions, the legal framework that emerged was enacted as a direct result of judicial decisions.  For example, between 2002 and 2004, courts in nine of Canada’s provinces and territories, including Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec, uniformly held that the exclusion of same-sex couples from the institution of civil marriage violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  See Halpern v. Canada (2003), 65 O.R. 3d 161 (Can. Ont. C.A.); EGALE Canada, Inc. v. Canada (2003), 225 D.L.R. 4th 472 (Can. B.C. C.A.); Hendricks v. Québec, [2002] R.J.Q. 2506 (Can. Que. C.S.), appeal dismissed,   8 To be sure, not every foreign state that has addressed these questions has ruled for marriage equality.  Italy’s highest appellate court, the Supreme Court of Cassation, recently ruled that same-sex couples were not entitled to full marriage rights under the country’s constitution, while at the same time recog-nizing their right to legal protections for their relationships.  Cass., sez. un., Feb. 9, 2015, n. 2400, 14 (It.), available at http://www.cortedicassazione.it/cassazione-resources/resources/ cms/documents/2400_02_15.pdf.  Yet as the history of other countries shows, such a decision requiring interim protections often later results in full marriage equality through court decision or legislation. 16 Hendricks v. Canada (2004), 238 D.L.R. 4th 577 (Can. Que. C.A.); App., infra, 3a-4a.  Following that guid-ance, the Canadian Parliament proposed a bill defin-ing marriage as the lawful union of two people.  In 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that this bill was constitutional, holding that “[t]he mere recognition of the equality rights of one group cannot, in itself, constitute a violation of the rights of anoth-er.”  Reference re Same-Sex Marriage, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 698, 719 para. 46 (Can.).  Canada’s Civil Marriage Act became law on July 20, 2005.  Civil Marriage Act, S.C. 2005, c. 33 (Can.).  In December 2005, the Constitutional Court of South Africa joined Canada in holding unconstitu-tional the exclusion of same-sex couples from the institution of civil marriage.  Minister of Home Affairs v. Fourie (“Fourie II”) 2006 (3) BCLR 355 (CC) (S. Afr.), aff ’g Fourie I, 2005 (3) BCLR 241.  In both Fourie decisions, the courts held that excluding same-sex couples from marriage violates constitutional rights to equality and human dignity.  The South African Parliament implemented the Constitutional Court’s ruling through legislation.  Civil Union Act 17 of 2006 (S. Afr.).   c. Recent court decisions also are paving the way for marriage equality in Colombia and Mexico.   In Colombia, the Constitutional Court held in 2011 that the constitution precludes the legislature from formally recognizing only opposite-sex couples, and it gave the legislature two years to implement a 17 solution that results in the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples.  See Corte Consti-tucional [C.C.] [Constitutional Court], July 26, 2011, Sentencia C-577/11 (Colom.).9  That deadline passed without action by the legislature, leading to the solemnization of some marriages of same-sex couples and to further litigation pending in the Constitutional Court.   After Mexico City amended its marriage laws to include same-sex couples, Mexico’s Supreme Court of Justice ruled in 2010 that those marriages must be recognized throughout Mexico.  App., infra, 7a.  In December 2012, the same court ruled unanimously that Oaxaca’s ban on marriage by same-sex couples was unconstitutional.  Amparo en Revisión 581/2012, Primera Sala de la Suprema Corte de Justicia [SCJN] [Supreme Court], Dec. 5, 2012 (Mex.).  That decision was based on a February 2012 decision of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which held that signatories to the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights could not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.  Atala Riffo and Daughters v. Chile, Merits, Reparations, and Costs, Judgment, Inter-Am. Ct. H.R. (ser. C) No. 239 (Feb. 24, 2012).  In 2014, the State of Coahuila became the first state in     9 Available at http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/comunicados/ No.%2030%20comunicado%2026%20de%20julio%20de%202011.php. 18 Mexico to adopt marriage equality through legisla-tion.  App., infra, 8a.10 2. Foreign jurisdictions have grounded same-sex marriage rights in part on the principle that liberty may not be denied without due process of law  This Court has long recognized that state laws may violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if they unduly restrict rights that are “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.”  Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 324-325 (1937).  “Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct.”  Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 562.  The heart of liberty “is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”  Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 851 (1992).  If liberty means anything, it must necessarily include the freedom to marry the person of one’s choosing.  See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12   10 In addition, in some cities and states in Mexico, courts have ordered civil registrars to allow particular same-sex couples to marry despite the absence of a state-wide ruling granting marriage rights to all same-sex couples.  E.g., Lawyer: Mexican City Allows Same-Sex Wedding After Long Fight, N.Y. TIMES (Jan. 17, 2015), http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/01/17/ world/americas/ap-lt-mexico-gay-marriage.html; Yucatan Court Orders Recognition of Gay Marriage, MEX. GULF REP. (Apr. 30, 2013), http://www.mexicogulfreporter.com/2013/04/yucatan-federal- court-orders.html.  19 (1967).  “Marriage is one of the ‘basic civil rights of man,’ fundamental to our very existence and surviv-al.”  Ibid. (quoting Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942)).  Deciding whom to marry is one of “ ‘the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime’ ” and is “ ‘central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.’ ”  Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 574 (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 851).  Our Constitution “demands” respect “for the autonomy of the person in making these choices.”  Ibid.   Laws that deny same-sex couples the opportunity to marry and/or to have their lawful marriages recog-nized deny couples the freedom to define their own relationships by choosing whether and whom to marry.  Accordingly, a number of foreign courts have recognized that the fundamental liberty interest to choose whom one will marry must include the right to marry a person of the same sex.   For example, the Court of Appeal for Ontario explained that the “common law requirement that persons who marry be of the opposite sex” violates core principles of liberty because it “denies persons in same-sex relationships a fundamental choice—whether or not to marry their partner.”  Halpern, 65 O.R. at 185 para. 87.  The court held that one of the “essential values” in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms “is liberty, basically defined as the absence of coercion and the ability to make funda-mental choices with regard to one’s life.”  Ibid. (inter-nal quotation marks omitted).  “Limitations * * * that 20 serve to restrict this freedom of choice among persons in conjugal relationships would be contrary to our notions of liberty.”  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Similarly, the Constitutional Court of South Africa reasoned that the freedom to marry is an essential component of the liberty rights of gay men and lesbians: The capacity to choose to get married en-hances the liberty, the autonomy and the dignity of a couple committed for life to each other.  It offers them the option of entering an honourable and profound estate that is adorned with legal and social recognition, rewarded with many privileges and secured by many automatic obligations.  It offers a social and legal shrine for love and for com-mitment and for a future shared with anoth-er human being to the exclusion of all others.  The current common-law definition of marriage deprives committed same-sex cou-ples of this choice.  In this our common law denies gays and lesbians who wish to solem-nise their union a host of benefits, protec-tions and duties. * * *  The vivid message of the decisions of the last ten years is that this exclusion cannot accord with the meaning of the Constitution, and that it undermines the values which un-derlie an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality. 21 Fourie I, (3) BCLR at 252-253 paras. 14-16 (footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted).  Likewise, the Superior Tribunal de Justiça of Brazil ruled that a same-sex couple could convert their civil union into marriage based, in part, on the freedom to define one’s family differently.  The court reasoned that “planning of the family is present as soon as there is a decision by two people to unite, with a view to constituting a family, and from that moment the Constitution guarantees to them full liberty of choice about the way in which this union will take place.”  S.T.J., Rec. Esp. No. 1.183.378-RS (2010/0036663-8) (Braz.). 3. Foreign jurisdictions have grounded their decisions in human dignity, which this Court has held is protected by the Constitution  In Lawrence, this Court acknowledged that “ ‘the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime’ ”—which are “ ‘central to personal dignity and autonomy’ ”—are “ ‘protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.’ ”  539 U.S. at 574 (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 851).  For that reason, Lawrence struck down the Texas statute banning sexual inti-macy between same-sex persons in part because the   22 “stigma th[e] criminal statute imposes” degrades “the dignity of the persons charged.”  Id. at 575.11   This Court’s decision in United States v. Windsor also relied heavily on the effect of the Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”) on the dignity of same-sex couples and their children.  133 S. Ct. 2675, 2692-2696 (2013).  The Court recognized that marriage “[r]esponsibilities, as well as rights, enhance the dignity and integrity of the person,” and therefore the State’s “decision to give [same-sex couples] the right to marry conferred upon them a dignity and status of immense import.”  Id. at 2692, 2694.  The Court declared Section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional in part because the “essence” of DOMA was to “interfere[ ] with the equal dignity of same-sex marriages,” by “divest[ing] married same-sex couples of the duties and responsibilities that are an essential part of married life.”  Id. at 2693, 2695.  The Court recog-nized that DOMA “place[d] same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage.”  Id. at 2694.  DOMA also “[told married same-sex] couples, and all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy of federal recognition.”  Ibid.   11 “[T]he Supreme Court has, since World War II and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, embedded the term dignity into the U.S. Constitution” as “an example of how U.S. law is influenced by the norms of other nations, by transnational experiences, and by international legal documents.”  Judith Resnik & Julie Chi-hye Suk, Adding Insult to Injury: Question-ing the Role of Dignity in Conceptions of Sovereignty, 55 STAN. L. REV. 1921, 1926 (2003). 23 This “differentiation demeans the couple,” and it likewise “humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples.”  Ibid.  The Court explained that DOMA “ma[de] it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.”  Ibid.   Like Lawrence and Windsor, much of the foreign jurisprudence on the rights of same-sex couples draws on judicial understandings of the dignity and worth of individual persons.12  In Halpern, the Court of Appeal for Ontario concluded that excluding same-sex cou-ples from the “fundamental societal institution [of ] marriage” discriminated against gay men and lesbi-ans in a manner that offended human dignity:  The societal significance of marriage, and the corresponding benefits that are available on-ly to married persons, cannot be overlooked.  Indeed, all parties are in agreement that marriage is an important and fundamental institution in Canadian society.  It is for that reason that the claimants wish to have ac-cess to the institution.  Exclusion perpetu-ates the view that same-sex relationships are less worthy of recognition than opposite-sex   12 See Christopher McCrudden, Human Dignity and Judicial Interpretation of Human Rights, 19 EUR. J. INT’L L. 655 (2008); Christopher Tollefsen, The Dignity of Marriage, in UNDERSTANDING HUMAN DIGNITY (Christopher McCrudden ed., 2013). 24 relationships.  In doing so, it offends the  dignity of persons in same-sex relationships [and is therefore discriminatory].  Halpern, 65 O.R. 3d at 189-190 para. 107.   As Halpern found, “this case is ultimately about the recognition and protection of human dignity.”  Id. at 167 para. 2.  In so finding, the court applied the Canadian Supreme Court’s decision in Law, which had defined human dignity as meaning “that an individual or group feels self-respect and self-worth,” and had held that “[h]uman dignity is harmed by unfair treatment premised upon personal traits or circumstances which do not relate to individual needs, capacities, or merits.”  Id. at 167 para. 3 (quoting Law v. Canada, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, 530 para. 53 (Can.)).13  Halpern also relied on the Ontario Human Rights Code, which provides: “[I]t is public policy in Ontario to recognize the dignity and worth of every person and to provide for equal rights and opportunities without discrimination that is contrary to law, and having as its aim the creation of a   13 In Law, the Supreme Court of Canada explained that the purpose of the equal protection provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is “to prevent the violation of essential human dignity and freedom through the imposition of disadvantage, stereotyping, or political or social prejudice, and to promote a society in which all persons enjoy equal recognition at law as human beings or as members of Canadian society, equally capable and equally deserving of concern, respect and consideration.”  1 S.C.R. at 529 para. 51.  25 climate of understanding and mutual respect for the dignity and worth of each person so that each person feels a part of the communi-ty and able to contribute fully to the devel-opment and well-being of the community and the Province[.]” Halpern, 65 O.R. 3d at 167 para. 4 (alterations in original) (quoting R.S.O. 1990, ch. H. 19, pmbl. (Can. Ont.)).  In the same vein, in EGALE, the British Colum-bia Court of Appeal (the highest court in British Columbia) stated that “[t]he evidence supports a conclusion that ‘marriage’ represents society’s highest acceptance of the self-worth and the wholeness of a couple’s relationship, and, thus, touches their sense of human dignity at its core.”  EGALE, 225 D.L.R. 4th at 501 para. 90.  The very act of public, civil marriage affirms the couple’s relationship and the life they intend to join together.  Denying one group the free-dom to take that step relegates them to a “separate but equal” status, affronts their dignity, and discrim-inates against them.  The South African marriage cases are also rooted in the same conception of human dignity and person-al autonomy.  In Fourie II, the Constitutional Court examined the intangible harms to human dignity from being denied both equal access to marriage and the right to choose to marry: It reinforces the wounding notion that they are to be treated as biological oddities, as 26 failed or lapsed human beings who do not fit into normal society, and, as such, do not qualify for the full moral concern and respect that our Constitution seeks to secure for eve-ryone.  It signifies that their capacity for love, commitment and accepting responsibil-ity is by definition less worthy of regard than that of heterosexual couples. Fourie II, (3) BCLR at 383 para. 71. Similarly, in Fourie I, the Supreme Court of Appeal stated: More deeply, the exclusionary definition of marriage injures gays and lesbians because it implies a judgment on them.  It suggests not only that their relationships and com-mitments and loving bonds are inferior, but that they themselves can never be fully part of the community of moral equals that the Constitution promises to create for all. Fourie I, (3) BCLR at 253 para. 15.   Like its Canadian counterpart, the South African Constitutional Court relied on a prior opinion con-cerning the importance of human dignity, National Coalition for Gay & Lesbian Equality v. Minister of Home Affairs (“National Coalition”) 2000 (1) BCLR 39 (CC) at 63 para. 42 (S. Afr.).  Fourie II, (3) BCLR at 374-375 para. 50.  In National Coalition, the Consti-tutional Court held that the partners of married different-sex couples cannot be given preferential immigration status over same-sex couples.  National Coalition, (1) BCLR at 82-83 para. 97.  Again, the reasoning of the Constitutional Court was unequivo-cal—human dignity, privacy, and equality demand 27 that same-sex couples’ relationships be afforded the same legal status as those of opposite-sex couples: Society at large has, generally, accorded far less respect to lesbians and their intimate re-lationships with one another than to hetero-sexuals and their relationships.  The sting of past and continuing discrimination against both gays and lesbians is the clear message that it conveys, namely, that they, whether viewed as individuals or in their same-sex relationships, do not have the inherent dig-nity and are not worthy of the human re-spect possessed by and accorded to heterosexuals and their relationships. Id. at 64 para. 42.  4. Foreign jurisdictions have recognized that excluding same-sex couples from marriage violates equal protection un-der the law  In Romer v. Evans, this Court struck down a Colorado constitutional amendment forbidding legal protection of sexual conduct between same-sex part-ners, in part, because the law “impos[ed] a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group.”  517 U.S. 620, 632 (1996).  In so holding, Romer rec-ognized an obvious truth: that unfounded and target-ed prejudice against a particular group can never be a legitimate government interest.  Yet as numerous foreign decisions recognize, marriage-exclusion laws are motivated by precisely the same illegitimate   28 interest that Romer disavowed: “a bare * * * desire to harm a politically unpopular group [which] cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.”  Id. at 634 (omission and emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).    In accord with our Nation’s equal-protection jurisprudence, several foreign decisions have conclud-ed that laws excluding same-sex couples from the rights and responsibilities of marriage impermissibly offend core values of equality.  In Fourie I, the South African Court of Appeal held that the exclusion of same-sex couples from an institution of such funda-mental social significance as marriage “undermines the values which underlie an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality.”  Fourie I, (3) BCLR at 253 para. 16 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  On appeal, the Constitutional Court concurred, holding that the exclusion of same-sex couples from civil marriage “represents a harsh if oblique statement by the law that same-sex couples are outsiders, and that their need for affirmation and protection of their intimate relations as human beings is somehow less than that of heterosexual couples.”  Fourie II, (3) BCLR at 383 para. 71.   In Colombia, the Constitutional Court held that the Colombian Constitution recognizes and protects the nation’s cultural diversity and that therefore an imposition of a single type of heterosexual family would be contrary to the Constitution.  See Corte Constitucional [C.C.] [Constitutional Court], July 26, 2011, Sentencia C-577/11 (Colom.) (summarizing the 29 decision as providing the government with a two year period before it must begin issuing same-sex mar-riage licenses).   Brazil’s Superior Tribunal de Justiça declared: “Equality, and equal treatment, presuppose the right to be different, the right to self-affirmation, and to a life-project that is independent of traditions and orthodoxies.  In a word: the right to equality is only realized in full if the right to difference is guaran-teed.”  S.T.J., Rec. Esp. No. 1.183.378-RS (2010/0036663-8) (Braz.) (emphasis omitted).  Prior to passage of Canada’s 2005 Civil Marriage Act, multiple Canadian courts ruled against the marriage exclusion that existed there, relying on precedents prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.  See Egan v. Canada, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513, 528-529 para. 5, 536 para. 22 (Can.) (recognizing that sexual orientation is “analogous to the enumerated grounds” listed in Section 15 of the Canadian Charter, and that it therefore falls under that Section’s equal-protection guarantee).   Mexico’s Supreme Court of Justice’s decision relies on the impermissibility of discriminating based on sexual orientation.  Amparo en Revisión 581/2012.  The court held that the Oaxacan state marriage law’s reference to a man and a woman constituted sexual-orientation discrimination.  The court held section 143 of the Civil Code of Oaxaca unconstitutional because it infringed on the principles of equality and freedom from discrimination enshrined in articles 1 30 and 4 of the Constitution.  Ibid.  The Court added that marriage is not static and that the institution must be adapted to changing realities in order to avoid discrimination.  Ibid.14  Global legislative activity respecting equal mar-riage has been similarly animated by these principles of ensuring equality and avoiding discrimination based on sexual orientation.  With the passage of equal-marriage legislation in Argentina in 2010, Senator Luis Juez announced that allowing same-sex couples to marry was a matter of legal equality, separate from other considerations.15 In introducing Mexico City’s 2009 legislation, assemblyman David   14 Even in Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, App. No. 30141/04 para. 105 (Eur. Ct. H.R. 2010), available at http://hudoc.echr. coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-99605, which held that Austria was not compelled to elevate a couple’s domestic part-nership to the status of marriage where Austrian law had not previously bestowed that status, the European Court of Human Rights expressly disavowed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  The court highlighted the “emerging European consensus towards legal recognition of same-sex couples,” and made clear that equal marriage was fully consistent with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and that same-sex couples enjoy a family life that is protected by the Convention.

It means that the law and the social and civil institu-tions that that law governs apply equally to every-one.”18  Conservative British cabinet member Maria Miller, who introduced the marriage-equality bill for England and Wales in the House of Commons, de-clared: “Marriage is not static; it has evolved and parliament has chosen to act over the centuries to make it fairer and more equal.

The attempt to define same-sex marriage differently from opposite-sex marriage while claiming that they are some-how equal would inevitably be seen by ordi-nary men and women in the street * * * as attempting to give the traditional view of marriage a superior status.  It is essential to be sure that the marriage of same-sex cou-ples is not regarded as less worthy than the marriage of opposite-sex couples.20  When that law took effect in 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron celebrated the “important moment for our country,” explaining that the law “says we are a country that will continue to honour its proud traditions of respect, tolerance and equal worth.”21    19 Patrick Wintour, Gay Marriage Plans Offer “Quadruple Lock” for Opposed Religious Groups, GUARDIAN (Dec. 11, 2012), http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/dec/11/gay-marriage- quadruple-lock-religious-groups.  20 747 PARL.

Denmark, the first country to grant some legal protections to same-sex couples through its Registered Partnership Act, replaced the registered-partnership regime with full marriage equality.23  The same was true in Sweden, Iceland, and Norway, all of which eliminated systems of registered partnerships for same-sex couples, recognizing that such a regime       22 Gov’t of Scotland, Press Release, Set the Date for First Same Sex Marriages (Oct. 13, 2014), http://news.scotland.gov.uk/ News/Set-the-date-for-first-Same-Sex-Marriages-1149.aspx.  23 Peter Stanners, Gay Marriage Legalised, COPENHAGEN POST (June 7, 2012), http://cphpost.dk/news/gay-marriage-legalised.1843.html. 34 is inadequate.24  When Coahuila became the first Mexican State to enact legislation authorizing same-sex marriage, congressman Samuel Acevedo ex-plained that the existing law allowing civil unions “infringed on the rights of homosexual people and now they will get their rights.”25  5. In contrast, many jurisdictions that do not respect individual freedom, dignity, and equality deny basic civil rights to gay men and lesbians   Despite the increased recognition of equal mar-riage rights in liberal democracies across the world, several nations continue to deny gay men and lesbi-ans virtually all fundamental freedoms, including the right to marry a person of one’s choice.

Nigeria, for example, recently enacted the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act, 2013, which goes far beyond prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying or having their marriages recognized.26  Whereas bare animus toward a group may render U.S. laws uncon-stitutional, see Romer, 517 U.S. at 632, Nigerian officials have been explicit in their anti-gay animus.27  The Act subjects anyone who enters into—or even witnesses—a same-sex marriage or civil union to imprisonment.28  The Act also imposes prison terms on anyone who “participates in” or “supports” socializ-ing among gay individuals or who “makes public show of same sex amorous relationship.”29   Several other “anti-model” regimes have actively encouraged repression against gay men and lesbians.    26 Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act, 2013 (Nigeria), available at https://allout-production-site.s3.amazonaws.com/allout- 200-Nigeria_Same_Sex_Marriage_Prohibition_Law_2014.pdf.   27 In Bauchi State in Northern Nigeria, some authorities have used passage of the law as license to increase persecution of gays and lesbians.  Chairman Mustapha Baba Ilela of the state Shariah Commission told the Associated Press that police had targeted gay men, tortured them into naming additional people, and “are on the hunt for others.”  Nate Rawlings, Anti-Gay Law Takes Effect in Africa’s Most Populous Country, TIME (Jan. 15, 2014), http://world.time.com/2014/01/15/nigeria-anti-gay-law/.   28 Id. § 5(1), (3).  29 Id. § 5(2)-(3). 36 Uganda has gained international notoriety for its attempts to criminalize same-sex relations.  For example, Uganda’s 2014 Anti-Homosexuality Act included provisions proscribing consensual same-sex intimate conduct by Ugandans outside the country, and included penalties for individuals, companies, media organizations, or non-governmental organiza-tions that know of gay people or support gay rights.30  Iran imposes a death sentence for the “passive” male involved in sodomy.31  The Gambia recently amended its criminal code to impose life sentences for homo-sexual activity.32   Russia too has adopted an anti-gay “propaganda” law that legalizes discrimination against sexual minorities.33  In December 2014, Human Rights   30 The Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2014 (Uganda).  In 2014, the Ugandan Supreme Court ruled that the law had been invalidly enacted because the legislature lacked a quorum.  See Oloka Onyago & 9 Ors v.

For example, the former U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said of Nigeria’s recent law: “Rarely have I seen a piece of legislation that in so few paragraphs directly violates so many basic, universal human rights.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed our Nation’s deep concern with Nigeria’s Act, stating that it “dangerously restricts freedom of assembly, association, and expression for all Nigerians.”38  The U.S. Department of State also expressed “dismay[ ]” at the Gambia’s law and urged the Gambia’s Government to “protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all its citizens.”39  The State Department recently designated a Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBT Persons  to “significantly advance efforts underway to  move towards a world free from violence and discrim-ination against LGBT persons.”40  In announcing the   37 U.N.

Foreign Jurisdictions Have Successfully Balanced Equal Marriage Rights And Reli-gious Freedom  Equal marriage rights need not intrude upon anyone’s religious freedom.  Unlike those states in which the persecution of gay men and lesbians has escalated, most liberal democracies are engaged in a rigorous debate concerning the scope and pace of equal rights as applied to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.  The experience of other constitu-tional democracies confirms that protecting the rights of same-sex couples to marry need not, and does not, denigrate the rights of others.   As the court in Halpern observed, “[a]llowing same-sex couples to marry does not result in a corre-sponding deprivation to opposite-sex couples.”  65 O.R. 3d at 195 para. 137.  Similarly, in a speech to Portugal’s parliament urging enactment of that country’s equal marriage law, Prime Minister José Sócrates explained: “No one should interpret this law as a victory of some over others.  This law represents a victory for all, this is always true of all laws about   41 Ibid. 40 liberty and humanity.”42  In a similar vein, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero expressed his support for Spain’s marriage equality law, noting that the triumph of the same-sex couples who obtained the right to marry “is everyone’s triumph.  It is also the triumph of those who oppose this law, even though they do not know this yet, because it is the triumph of liberty.”43    Significantly, foreign jurisdictions that have authorized same-sex marriages have successfully balanced individual rights with community prefer-ences, not by condoning illegal discrimination, but rather by permitting religious institutions and clergy to choose whether to solemnize marriages between same-sex couples.  Both the Supreme Court of Cana-da and South Africa’s Constitutional Court ensured that religious officials may continue to enjoy the full exercise of their beliefs by permitting clergy to refuse to solemnize marriages between people of the same sex.  Reference re Same-Sex Marriage, 3 S.C.R. at 721-723 paras. 55-60; Fourie II, (3) BCLR at 392-393 para. 98.  Other jurisdictions have followed suit. For example, the laws legalizing same-sex marriage in England, Wales, and Scotland exempt religious organizations from having to perform same-sex   42 Diário da Assembleia da República, 1 Série Número. 20 at 8 (Jan. 9, 2010), available at http://tinyurl.com/na4s6vg.  43 Michael Kirby, Foreword, in CURRENT TRENDS IN REGU-LATION OF SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS x (Paula Gerber & Adiva Sifris eds., 2010). 41 weddings.  Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act of 2013, Chapter 30, 17 July 2013 (Eng.) (effective March 29, 2014); Marriage and Civil Partnership Act, 12 March 2014 (A.S.P. 5) (Scot.) (effective December 31, 2014).  As a result, the many religious organizations that recognize same-sex marriages may—and do—solemnize such marriages while others are free to choose not to.   That predominantly Catholic countries such as Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil now allow same-sex marriages (either throughout the country or in some jurisdictions), vividly illustrates that religious freedom and individual rights can readily co-exist with respect to same-sex marriage.  Those jurisdictions made the deliberate choice—whether through legislation or judicial decision—to implement same-sex marriages despite strong opposi-tion from leaders of the Catholic Church.  Their choices show an emerging global consensus among liberal democracies that governments best ensure the dignity and autonomy of all people not by stigmatiz-ing some and arbitrarily denying equal access to the legal institution of marriage, but rather by respecting the religious freedom of some groups to grant solemn recognition of the sacrament of marriage in accord-ance with the particular tenets of their faith.  CONCLUSION  For the foregoing reasons and those stated in petitioners’ briefs, States may not exclude same-sex couples from the essential institution of marriage, nor 42 may they refuse to recognize marriages between persons of the same sex when their marriages were lawfully licensed and performed out of state.   Forty-eight years ago, this Court overturned state law prohibitions on interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia.  In the past fourteen years, nu-merous democratic nations around the world have honored the equal protection legacy of this Court by embracing marriage equality.  To preserve U.S. leadership in the field of personal freedom and hu-man rights, the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.  Respectfully submitted, NOAH B.
