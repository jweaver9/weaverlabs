The WITNESS Media Lab, a WITNESS program in collaboration with Google News Lab, is dedicated to unleashing the potential of eyewitness video as a powerful tool to report, monitor, and advocate for human rights. We believe that the next stage of human rights documentation and advocacy will be powered by videos created and shared by eyewitnesses. Our work addresses the challenges of finding, verifying, and contextualizing those videos. In collaboration with peers from the fields of advocacy, technology, and journalism, we develop solutions to ensure that footage taken by average citizens can serve as an effective tool for justice.DATA & REPORT DESIGNPROJECT SUPERVISORSMadeleine BairProgram Manager, WITNESS Media LabKaren Stevenson2016 WITNESS Media Lab Fellow DATA COLLECTION & ANALYSIS TECHNICAL SUPPORTMetropolitan InteractiveJeffrey Mele, Chief Executive OfficerKevin Lyons, Software EngineerKaren Stevenson2016 WITNESS Media Lab Fellow Flora Wolpert Checknoff2016 WITNESS Media Lab InternABOUT the WITNESS MEDIA LABABOUT WITNESSWITNESS trains and supports activists and citizens around the world to use video safely, ethically, and effectively to expose human rights abuse and fight for human rights change.Share: copy and redistribute the material in any medium or formatAdapt: remix, transform, and build upon the materialAttribution: You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.

The videos and viewer engagement with them tell a powerful and disturbing story of the abusive and often life threatening environments that transgender and gender nonconforming people navigate daily. The hard won legal victories that the LGBTQ community has achieved in the U.S. has triggered a backlash. There have been over 100 proposed anti-LGBTQ state laws since the passage of marriage equality in June 2015, many of them specifically targeting transgender people. Anti-LGBTQ violence, particularly against transgender people of color, has been called an “epidemic” by anti-violence groups, and, a majority of U.S. states can legally exclude transgender communities from public accommodation, employment, housing and healthcare. Meeting the needs and understanding the issues facing transgender and gender nonconforming people is understudied because general population surveys that currently determine policy, social services and funding do not include questions about gender identity beyond the male and female binary. And, being uncounted means being overlooked.This project explores the untapped potential of eyewitness video as a way to fill that gap. By collecting and analyzing viewer engagement with eyewitness videos, we’ve found an innovative way of unmasking patterns of discrimination and abuse. Further, it challenges the conventional notion that data affecting policy and funding is only valuable if gleaned from government, institutional or academic surveys. The persistent lack of data on transgender people’s lives from authoritative federal surveys is one of the greatest policy failures facing the trans movement today.National Center for Transgender Equality““7PREFACE engagement only with videos that captured physical assault and we analyzed data from four very different sites. We included YouTube, where we found the most videos, but the content represents just a small segment of the platform’s total offerings. World Star Hip Hop and Fly Height are “shock” sites that solicit and promote these videos to drive traffic and to monetize as part of their business models. And, Live Leak, a video aggregator that promotes itself as a cutting edge news outlet known for breaking particularly gruesome content (e.g., the execution of Saddam Hussein).Significantly absent from this study is the viewer engagement data from eyewitness videos hosted on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Vine. In our URL harvests we found thousands of video links on these platforms matching the search criteria, and tens of thousands of Facebook “likes” from platforms we did analyze. In test studies we found that most videos were uploaded to a hosting platform then shared to social media platforms furthering viewer engagement. Capturing and analyzing that data exceeded project resources in both cost and capacity.Even with this small sample size, LGBTQ advocacy organizations we consulted were surprised by the number of eyewitness videos of violence against transgender people and stunned by how widely viewed and favorably rated they were. Most alarming are the vitriolic comments that are ongoing. We found videos posted years ago that are still being engaged with today.This study tells the story of abuse suffered by transgender and gender nonconforming people in a unique and compelling way. Just as eyewitness video of police brutality in communities of color in the U.S. removed plausible deniability and launched a worldwide movement demanding transparency and change, it is our hope that these findings raise greater awareness and spark discussion of the cultural and political climate that is fostering discrimination and encouraging violence against transgender communities. And, we hope it creates a sense of urgency in making laws and policies that protect them. In an effort to address the shortcomings of federal data and to supplement other research the WITNESS Media Lab looked to eyewitness videos of transphobic violence and the viewer engagement with them as a new and arguably more compelling source of data. We found hundreds of videos made not with the intention of exposing or prosecuting abuse, but rather, content that is captured, shared, and engaged with as entertainment. Our analysis of the engagement with those videos -- including ratings, comments and how the videos are captured, titled and described -- proves that abuse and discrimination against transgender people is widespread and undercounted. And, the content condones, or even encourages, violent acts against them. The existence of these videos and the volume of hateful engagement pose a direct threat to gender nonconforming people and compromise a positive and empowered representation of these communities. However, we think that there are ethical and effective ways that these videos, though they are intended to cause harm, can be used for advocacy. Balancing the tensions between re-victimization and exploitation and the potent way video exposes abuse is an ongoing challenge. But, there is no doubting the singular impact of eyewitness video in exposing human rights abuses and empowering marginalized communities.PROJECT SCOPEThis report is the result of the 2016 WITNESS Media Lab Curation Fellowship. To scope this project for a 15-week engagement, our study includes just a small sampling of the tens of thousands of videos we found that included transgender and gender nonconforming people as targets of assault, being threatened or intimidated, harassed, stalked, bullied, mocked, as targets in violent video games, portrayed as deviant on television shows and in film, and even murdered. We studied viewer 8PARTNERS & ADVISORSKylar BroadusExecutive Director, Trans People of Color Coalition (TPOCC)Beverly TilleryExecutive Director, New York City Anti-Violence Project (AVP)There’s not been enough research on what the real trans experience is like. This report and its findings illustrate the violent reality of our lives in a way that’s not been seen to date.For many people, the existence of these videos is a secondary act of violence. We need to seriously consider policies that give control back to the survivors.“ ““ “9Trans People of Color Coalition (TPOCC)Founded in 2010, Trans People of Color was created as a response to people of color (POC) who felt unheard and underrepresented in the trans equality movement. TPOCC became an effort to organize trans people of color to assure that POC voices be at the center of the conversation and are included in making key decisions that impact the trans community at large.New York City Anti-Violence ProjectAVP was founded in 1980 in Chelsea in reaction to neighborhood incidents of anti-gay violence. Today, AVP provides free and confidential assistance to thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and HIV-affected people each year from all five boroughs of New York City through direct client services and community organizing and public advocacy.  AVP was named a White House Champion of Change for our work on intimate partner violence within LGBTQ & HIV-affected communities. In 2010, their Board of Directors received the Alan Morrow Prize for Board Excellence from the Stonewall Foundation.PROJECT ADVISORSVirginia Goggin, Legal Services DirectorThe New York City Anti-Violence Project M.

People who exhibit gender variance may be called gender variant, gender non-conforming, gender diverse, gender atypical or genderqueer, and may be transgender or otherwise variant in their gender identity.GENDER BINARYThe gender binary is the classification of sex and gender into two distinct, opposite and disconnected forms of masculine and feminine.TRANSGENDERTransgender is a general term used to describe people whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.GENDER NONCONFORMINGGender nonconforming refers to people who do not follow other people’s ideas or stereotypes about how they should look or act based on the female or male sex they were assigned at birth.TRANSFEMININETransfeminine is a term used to describe transgender people who were assigned male at birth, but identify with femininity to a greater extent than with masculinity. TRANSMASCULINETransmasculine is a term used to describe transgender people who were assigned female at birth, but identify with masculinity to a greater extent than with femininity.11This report contains text and images that are racist, transphobic, homophobic, and portray acts of physical violence involving transgender and gender non-conforming people! TRIGGER WARNINGResearch Terms and Engagement FindingsTo find videos of violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people that have been captured, shared and engaged with as entertainment, we searched with the most common* derogatory terms used by filmers and viewers to describe the content.These search terms (“tranny fight” and “stud fight”) located the most videos that were captured and shared not for advocacy purposes, but to disparage, mock and humiliate trans and gender non-conforming people. They are hateful and meant to cause harm.Examples of the comments made by viewers are particularly disturbing.* In preliminary searches we used over 90 other words and phrases; these phrases returned the most videos matching our research frameworkVideo Screen ShotsTo illustrate the violent acts, and the vitriol of viewers’ responses to them, we’ve included screen shots from four of the videos we found. They show transgender and gender non-conforming people being physically assaulted. 1213EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Engagement Data89,233,760VIEWSnumber of times videos were watched601,300SHARESnumber of times videos were shared554,143LIKESnumber of times videos were rated favorably by viewers230,262COMMENTSnumber of comments made by viewersViewer engagement with videos of physical violence against transgender and gender nonconforming people that were captured, shared, and engaged with as entertainment.2 search terms used*tranny fight  &  stud fight4 platforms / sites searchedYouTube, World Star Hip Hop, Live Leak, Fly Height329 videos of physical assaultsfound & analyzedproject scope* derogatory terms used by filmers and viewers when describing, rating   or commenting on violent acts involving transgender and gender nonconforming people14EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Viewer Engagement by PlatformFrom the comments“I would’ve loved to see him throw the trannie onto the tracks!”From the comments“LMFAO what did IT expect coming over there talking smack & trying to push IT’s lifestyle on normal people they should have all took turns shoving large objects up IT’s vag and butt”From the comments“A man that’s all. no woman and will never be. don’t care how many dicks he suck and fuck. nasty gay bastard.”From the comments“Am I the only one who feels physically sick when looking at trannys?”15EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Viewer Engagement by Search Phrasetranny fight19663,131,514595,466292,642144,434stud fight13326,102,2465,834261,50185,828search phrasephrases used to find eyewitness videosvideosnumber of eyewitness videos of physical assaultsviewsnumber of times the eyewitness videos were watchedsharesnumber of times the eyewitness videos were sharedlikesnumber of times the eyewitness videos were liked by viewerscommentsnumber of viewer comments about the eyewitness videos16EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Comments Word Cloud, Tranny FightVisualization of comments from all videos found with the search phrase “tranny fight”17EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Comments Word Cloud, Stud FightVisualization of comments from all videos found with the search phrase “stud fight”18EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Observations64% of total videos were found on YouTubeDespite policies that explicitly prohibit content that incites hatred or promotes violence against individuals and groups based on race, sexual orientation and gender identity, we found more videos on YouTube than on all three other platforms combined. We do not, however, know how many videos of this kind have been removed for violating these terms. 71% of total views were on World Star Hip HopShock sites World Star Hip Hop and Fly Height hosted fewer videos, but dominated viewer engagement. Several of the most brutal videos were viewed by millions on these platforms.39% of videos on YouTube were categorized as entertainment or comedyThe most popular category was the default “People & Blogs” at 42%.99% of total ratings were “likes”Viewers gave the content favorable ratings -- e.g., liked, LOL, thumbs up, hilarious, etc. -- overwhelmingly more than negative or critical responses.The search terms we used to source the greatest volume of video links almost exclusively captured incidents from urban environments involving people of color. We found the most videos on YouTube, which is not surprising given the platform’s enormous inventory. The videos most engaged with were found on, or originated from, “shock”  entertainment sites. We acknowledge that the observations and conclusions in this report cannot fully capture the attitudes toward trans and gender nonconforming people in urban communities of color. 19urban spaces, people of colorA majority of the transfeminine encounters occurred in crowded urban, public spaces.A majority of the transmasculine encounters occurred in more private spaces, with fewer bystanders. Nearly all encounters involved people of color as victim, perpetrator, or both.questioning gender, characteristics of “real” men and womenTitles, descriptions and comments contain transphobic language that suggests viewers’ rigid attachment to a gender binary, especially the presumptive appearance, mannerisms and dress associated with those roles.

They show acts of violence against these communities that are not only tolerated, but encouraged and glorified. The viewer engagement with these eyewitness videos reveal deeply held biases that intersect race, sex, class and gender identity. The attitudes expressed by viewers overwhelmingly blame gender nonconforming people for the violence and hatred perpetrated against them and expose a visceral rejection of people transgressing accepted notions of gender expression. The ongoing engagement with these videos and the hostility expressed by viewers are compounding acts of discrimination that traumatize not only individual victims, but have broader consequences for gender nonconforming communities as a whole. They are a persistent reminder of the threat to the physical and emotional safety of all people who identify beyond the gender binary. These eyewitness videos and their corresponding viewer engagement have real and sustained impact. A survivor’s loss of privacy and control over their public image in the aftermath often compounds injury with the loss of employment, housing, and personal relationships. The circulation and replaying of these traumatic events not only denies survivors a safe space to heal, but has a chilling effect on all gender nonconforming people.““My private life has been exposed to the world. I lost my job. I cannot go anywhere without the fear of getting hurt again. I want to go into a hole and hide.                 Chrissy Polis, Survivor“I would have fucking killed that aids ridden little faggot with daddy issues that wants to call himself a girl.”  Viewer Comment21The majority of the videos found are on YouTube, the only platform we studied that specifically mentions protection from hate speech that encourages or incites violence based on race, sexual orientation and gender identity. These videos clearly violate those policies. Despite those policies, the videos continue to be viewed and engaged with underscoring the challenges of enforcing compliance and creating environments that encourage civil and non-discriminatory discourse.These videos were captured, shared and engaged with as entertainment reflecting an accepted social and political environment that poses a real and imminent threat to transgender and gender nonconforming people. This report serves as a reminder that there is an urgent and ongoing need to document the abuse suffered by these communities so that laws and policies are instituted to protect them.Finally, we think that these videos, and the viewer engagement data associated with them, show yet another way eyewitness video can be used for advocacy. Even though this content was intended to do harm, if used ethically, it documents discrimination and abuse in a way no other reports on transphobic violence has done to date. The study of eyewitness videos, coupled with an analysis of how viewers engage with them, is a powerful way to expose human rights abuses.“If you see a crazy tranny coming at you. Don’t fight it. You might catch AIDS. Just shoot it.” Viewer CommentOrganizations and activists should use this data in their advocacy campaigns as a way of documenting abuse and discrimination against transgender and gender nonconforming people. Use the findings from this research to raise greater awareness and spark discussion of the cultural and political climate that is fostering discrimination and encouraging violence against these communities. The websites that host videos, brands that advertise on them, and news outlets and activists that distribute them should consider their harmful effect. Ethical guidelines and technical tools can help expose abuse while protecting the privacy and security of victims of abuse.Avoid the recirculation and descriptions of the videos that may can cause further and long-lasting harm to the survivors. If your intention is to expose or report on abuse, refer to the WITNESS Ethical Guidelines for the ethical use of eyewitness videos.Platforms and sites that host these videos should increase transparency around policy enforcement and decisions that allow for the sharing and engagement with violent content that is not shared to expose, challenge or prosecute abuse, but is captured shared and engaged with as entertainment.Recommendations",
