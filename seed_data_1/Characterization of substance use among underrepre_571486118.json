Objective(s): Toidentify substance use differences among less commonly described SGM identity-based subgroups.Methods: The PRIDE Study is a national, online, longitudinal cohort study of self-identified SGMadults living in the U.S. Between 2015–2017, an iPhone application was used to administer threecross-sectional health questionnaires to participants, one of which included questions about bingealcohol, marijuana, and other drug use (substance use). This study was a secondary data analysisof participant responses to substance use survey items. Logistic regression and generalized linearmodeling assessed relationships between sexual orientation or gender and use of or reportedproblems with substances within the past year. Results: Among the 1790 participants included inthis study, 51.0% reported binge alcohol use, 39.8% reported marijuana use, and 19.7% reportedother drug use (65.9% endorsed use of one or more of these) within the past year. Over 30% indi-cated substance use had been a problem in their life. Asexual individuals had lower odds ofreporting past year binge alcohol and marijuana use (aOR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.12–0.61; aOR: 0.38, 95%CI: 0.15–0.96, respectively), and queer participants had higher odds of reporting past year mari-juana use (aOR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.58–4.03) compared to lesbian participants. Gender nonbinary par-ticipants had lower odds of reporting past year binge alcohol use (aOR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.32–0.71)and transmasculine participants had higher odds of reporting past year marijuana use (aOR: 2.18,95% CI: 1.10–4.31) compared to cisgender women. Conclusions: Substance use heterogeneity existsbetween SGM groups. Comprehensive assessment of sexual orientation and gender may improveunderstanding of substance use and increase equity within support and treatment services forSGM populations.HIGHLIGHTS\u0003 We examined substance use among less represented sexual and gender minority groups.\u0003 Alcohol and other drug use were examined by both sexual orientation and gender identity.\u0003 Analyses included identities such as queer, pansexual, genderqueer and nonbinary.\u0003 Alcohol use differed across asexual, genderqueer and gender nonbinary groups.\u0003 Marijuana use differed across queer, asexual and transmasculine groups.KEYWORDSLGBT; sexual orientation;gender identity; alcoholuse; marijuana use;drug useIntroductionAlmost 20 million people in the United States report sub-stance use in greater quantities for more extended periodsthan intended and experience problems related to substanceuse.1 Both sexual minority (i.e., those with non-heterosexualsexual orientations) and gender minority (i.e., those whosegenders do not match their assigned sex at birth) individualsexperience problems related to substance use at dispropor-tionately higher rates than the general population.2–10Sexual minority men and women are more likely thanheterosexual people to report currently drinking alcohol,using illicit drugs in the past year, having a substance usedisorder, and experiencing negative thoughts or feelings\u0001 2020 The Author(s).

Numerous studies haveidentified links between minority stress and increased likeli-hood of substance use.13–19 Initially limited to sexual minor-ity groups, this framework was expanded to gender minoritypopulations20 and suggests similar adverse health outcomesamong gender minority individuals (e.g., transgender, gendernonbinary persons) may result from increased exposure tostigma and discrimination related to one’s gender identity(i.e., someone’s internal sense of their gender) and/or genderexpression (i.e., how someone chooses to reflect their gen-der) compared to non-gender minority (i.e., cisgender1)populations.20,21Research examining substance use across a diverse spec-trum of sexual orientations and gender identities, however,remains limited.22–24 Substance use studies that include sex-ual orientation and gender identity are typically limited tolesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals3,4,9,17,22,25–27and use binary identity classifications (e.g., heterosexual vs.homosexual; cisgender vs. transgender).28–32 Other studiescombine sexual orientation and gender identity into a singleclassification of sexual and gender minority (SGM) status(e.g., LGBT vs. Non-LGBT; grouping transgender partici-pants with gay and bisexual cisgender men as men whohave sex with men).31,33–36Sexual and gender minority individuals may define boththeir sexual orientation and gender identity in a variety ofways, not necessarily limited to LGB or man, woman, ortransgender. Currently, the substance use of people fromless commonly described SGM identity groups, such as pan-sexual, queer, and genderqueer individuals, is not welldescribed. Without acknowledging the broader spectrum ofidentities that exist within this population, our understand-ing of the sociocultural and environmental circumstancesthat uniquely impact these identity groups will remain lim-ited. Continued characterization of and assessment forharmful substance use among a limited subset of the overallSGM population also has implications in our ability toeffectively tailor substance use treatment programs for thosein this population most at risk for elevated substance use.Here we evaluated differences in alcohol, marijuana, andother drug use (i.e., illicit or used-not-as-prescribed) withina national cohort of self-identified SGM individuals. Weexamined substance use within and across SGM identitygroups, including less commonly described SGM identitiesand explored potential relationships between sexualorientation or gender identity and risk for elevated alcohol,marijuana, and other drug use.MethodsData collection and study proceduresThe Population Research in Identity and Disparities forEquality (PRIDE) Study is a U.S.-based, longitudinal studyof SGM adult health. From 2015–2017, The PRIDE Studyused an iPhone mobile application to engage participantsand collect demographic and health information aboutSGM-identified research participants. Participants wererecruited via convenience sampling approach through a var-iety of online, multi- and social media materials. Interestedparticipants needed to download the iPhone application(app) from the Apple App Store. When launched, the apppresented potential participants with study information, aneligibility screening questionnaire, and study consent forms.To be eligible, participants needed to (i) be at least 18 yearsold at time of participation, (ii) live in the U.S., (iii) identifyas a sexual and/or gender minority, and (iv) be comfortablereading and writing in English. After eligibility screeningand informed consent, individuals could engage with ThePRIDE Study mobile app through a variety of optional activ-ities, including providing basic demographic data, answeringone of four optional questionnaires that surveyed (i) phys-ical health, (ii) mental and behavioral health, (iii) social andemotional health, and (iv) how to improve The PRIDEStudy, or interacting with an anonymous forum to discussresearch topics of interest among SGM communities. Moreinformation about app and survey construction, participantrecruitment, and sampling methods are described else-where.37 We performed a secondary data analysis of partici-pant responses to alcohol, marijuana, and other drug usesurvey items contained in the mental health survey fromThe PRIDE Study application, including prior problemswith and past-year use of specific substances. Participantswho did not report their sexual orientation, gender identity,and sex assigned at birth were excluded from our analysesof these substance use survey data. The University ofCalifornia, San Francisco Institutional Review Boardapproved this study.MeasuresDemographicsDemographic characteristics included participant age, race,ethnicity, highest level of education, and individual annualgross income. Participant 5-digit US ZIP code was used togenerate US Census Bureau geographical region.Gender identityCurrent gender identity and sex assigned at birth wereassessed by asking participants, “How would you describeyour current gender identity?” and “What sex were youassigned (on your birth certificate)?” Gender identityresponse options included “Genderqueer,” “Man,1“Cisgender” is used within the context of this article to describe individualswhose experience with gender identity and/or expression are congruent withthat individual’s sex assigned at birth. Because cisgender individuals may bereferenced as members of a majority population, non-cisgender individuals(e.g., transgender, gender nonbinary individuals) may conversely be referred toas ‘gender minority.’SUBSTANCE ABUSE 105“Transgender Man (Female-to-Male),” “Woman,”“Transgender Woman (Male-to-Female),” and “AnotherGender Identity.” Participants could select multipleresponses and, if “Another Gender Identity” was selected,provide a written description of their gender. Options forsex assigned at birth included “Female” and “Male.”Six gender categories were created for analyses: cisgenderwomen (i.e., participants assigned female sex at birth andidentified as a woman), cisgender men (i.e., participantsassigned male sex at birth and identified as a man), trans-masculine individuals (i.e., participants assigned female sexat birth and identified as a man, transgender man or both),transfeminine individuals (i.e., participants assigned malesex at birth and identified as a woman, transgender womanor both), genderqueer individuals (i.e., participants whoexclusively identified as genderqueer regardless of sexassigned at birth), and individuals with another gender iden-tity (i.e., participants who identified with multiple gendersor provided a written description of their gender that didnot match the sex they were assigned at birth). In someanalyses, gender experience was accounted for and wasdefined as masculine (i.e., participants who were categorizedas a gender that reflected a masculine binary, including cis-gender men and transmasculine individuals), feminine (i.e.,participants who were categorized as a gender that reflecteda feminine binary, including cisgender women and transfe-minine individuals), or gender expansive (i.e., participantswho were categorized as having a nonbinary gender, includ-ing genderqueer and individuals with another gen-der identity).Sexual orientationParticipants were asked, “How would you describe your cur-rent sexual orientation?” Participants could select multipleresponses, including “Asexual,” “Bisexual,” “Gay,” “Lesbian,”“Queer,” “Questioning,” “Straight/Heterosexual,” and“Another Sexual Orientation.” If “Another SexualOrientation” was selected, participants could provide a short,written description of their sexual orientation.Substance useSubstances assessed included binge alcohol use (i.e., five ormore drinks on one occasion,38 chosen as a stand-aloneitem as binge drinking guidelines have not yet been estab-lished for gender minority people), marijuana use, and non-prescription or recreational use of cocaine/crack cocaine;amphetamines/methamphetamine; opioids or prescriptionopioids such as heroin, OxyContin or Vicodin; sedatives orprescription sedatives such as Xanax, Valium or Ativan; hal-lucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD/acid) orpsychedelic mushrooms; and other drugs with examplesgiven of MDMA/Ecstasy, GHB or ketamine. For each sub-stance, participants were asked to report the last time theyused that substance: “Within the last 30 days,” “More than30 days ago but within the last 12months,” “More than12months ago,” and “Never used.” Participants who indi-cated the use of a particular substance within the last30 days were prompted to provide the number of days usedin the past 30 days.Prior substance use problems were examined by askingparticipants, “Have you ever thought that you had a prob-lem with (either alcohol or other drug use, non-nicotine ornon-alcohol-related)?” Responses included “Yes, but notnow,” “Yes, and I think I still have this problem,” and“I have never had this problem.”Data analysisWe performed logistic regression analyses to examine rela-tionships between sexual orientation or gender category andpast year binge alcohol, marijuana, or other drug use as wellas prior reported problems with alcohol or other drugs(illicit or used-not-as-prescribed). Generalized linear regres-sion models examined count data for the number of days ofbinge alcohol or marijuana use within the last 30 days.Negative binomial models were fitted over Poisson or quasi-Poisson approaches to account for overdispersion in each ofthe count variables. Likelihood ratio tests (a¼ 0.00) con-firmed model fit.Gender (i.e., comparing groups by created gender catego-ries) and sexual orientation (i.e., comparing groups by sex-ual orientation) were modeled separately with eachsubstance use outcome. Because The PRIDE Study is anentirely SGM self-identified cohort and models testing fordifferences by sexual orientation or gender category wereperformed separately, models of gender category wereadjusted for sexual minority status. Given potential differen-tial effects of gender socialization on patterns of substanceuse, models testing differences in substance use by sexualorientation were adjusted for gender experience (i.e., mascu-line, feminine, or gender expansive). In addition to modelstesting main effects of sexual orientation, we ran models ofsexual orientation using an interaction term between sexualorientation and the gender experience variable in order toidentify differences related to gender experience within sex-ual orientation groups. All models were adjusted for age,race, ethnicity, and sex assigned at birth.We report adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and adjusted rateratio (aRR) estimates for logistic and negative binomialregressions, respectively. Statistical significance was deter-mined using a standard alpha level (a < 0.05). Given thatsubstance use has been better characterized among cisgenderlesbian women than among other less frequently representedSGM groups described here, models of sexual orientationuse lesbian individuals as the reference group; models ofgender use cisgender women as the reference group.11,39Overall group differences across sexual orientation or gendercategories were examined using post-estimation Wald testsof adjusted main effects regression models. All covariatesused in regression models had less than 5.0% missing data;results presented here are complete-case estimates of differ-ential patterns of reported substance use. All analyses wereconducted using Stata SE version 14 software.40106 B. T. BARGER ET AL.ResultsSample characteristicsOf the 16,394 consented participants, nearly all (N¼ 16385,99.95%) completed demographic survey items. Analyses pre-sented here focus on participant responses to substance usesurvey items that were contained in a separate, optionalquestionnaire that focused on a variety of other mental andbehavioral health topics. The initial module sample consistedof 1833 participants, of which, 42 individuals were excludedfor not meeting inclusion criteria for these analyses. Oneadditional participant was excluded since they were catego-rized as a cisgender woman and identified as “Straight/Heterosexual.” Sociodemographic characteristics of the finalsample (N¼ 1790) are presented in Table 1.Approximately 19% (N¼ 342) of participants were genderminority, and 99% (N¼ 1766) were sexual minority(Table 1). About 6.4% (N¼ 114) of participants provided awritten description of their sexual orientation: 66 individualswrote “pansexual,” 3 individuals wrote “asexual,” and 1 indi-vidual wrote “bisexual.” All other responses were either anarrative description of the individual’s sexual orientation ora combination of multiple terms (e.g., “Grey-Asexual orDemisexual”). As a result, we created eight sexual orienta-tion categories for analyses: asexual (N¼ 40), bisexual(N¼ 213), gay (N¼ 744), lesbian (N¼ 233), queer (N¼ 144),heterosexual (N¼ 24), pansexual (N¼ 66), and another sex-ual orientation (N¼ 326). Participants grouped as “anothersexual orientation” included those who reported multiplesexual orientations (N¼ 311). Due to small sample size, par-ticipants who responded “Questioning” (N¼ 6) as their cur-rent sexual orientation were also grouped as “another sexualorientation.” Given that all participants who identified asheterosexual in this sample (N¼ 24) were categorized asgender minority, heterosexual sexual identity was excludedfrom all models of sexual orientation.Any self-reported substance useAlmost two-thirds of participants (N¼ 1152; 65.9%)reported binge alcohol, marijuana, or other drug use withinthe last year (Table 1). Rates of specific other drug arereported in Appendix. Among gender minority participants,71.4% (N¼ 35) of transmasculine, 51.2% (N¼ 22) of transfe-minine, 57.1% (N¼ 44) of genderqueer, and 54.3% (N¼ 44)of individuals with another gender endorsed binge alcohol,marijuana, or other drug use within the last year. Amongless commonly reported sexual minority groups, 66.7%(N¼ 96) of queer, 53.0% (N¼ 35) of pansexual, and 64.7%(N¼ 211) of other-identified sexual minority individualsendorsed past year binge alcohol, marijuana, or otherdrug use.Prior substance use problemsMost participants reported never having a problem withalcohol (N¼ 1345, 76.1%) or other substances (N¼ 1477,Table 1.

After adjust-ment for sexual minority status, age, sex assigned at birth,race, and ethnicity, Wald testing indicated no overall groupdifferences in prior substance use problems by gender(Table 2).In models testing differences by sexual orientation, therewere no significant differences in the odds of reportingeither prior alcohol or other drug use problems between sex-ual identity groups when compared to lesbian participantsas a reference. However, after adjustment for age, sexassigned at birth, race, ethnicity, and gender experience, aWald test indicated that sexual orientation was a significantpredictor of prior alcohol use problems (v2 ¼ 13.84,p¼ 0.03, Table 2). In models testing interactions betweensexual orientation and gender experience, there were nostatistically significant differences in prior alcohol use prob-lems between groups when compared to feminine lesbianparticipants as reference.

After adjustment, Wald testing indicated no group dif-ferences in past-year other drug use across sexualorientation or gender categories. There were no significantdifferences in past-year other drug use by sexual orientation,compared to lesbian participants in either adjusted full-effector interaction-based models.DiscussionWe described binge alcohol, marijuana, and other drug useamong SGM adults, examining differences among less com-monly described identity groups and found significant het-erogeneity in substance use across sexual orientation andgender category. Queer and transmasculine persons had twotimes greater odds of reporting past-year marijuana usecompared to lesbian individuals and cisgender women,respectively. Genderqueer and individuals with another gen-der had lower odds of reporting binge alcohol use comparedto cisgender women. Asexual participants had lower odds ofreporting almost all substance use outcomes compared tolesbian individuals.To our knowledge, this is one of few studies to examinesubstance use differences among sexual minority individualsusing less commonly described identity subgroups. Thisstudy is also the first to indicate that asexual individualsmay be at lower risk of reporting substance use compared toother sexual minority groups. When looking at interactionsbetween sexual orientation and gender experience, resultsindicate that gender socialization (e.g., how typical genderroles inform access to and acceptability of use of differentsubstances) may impact differential patterns of substanceuse across sexual minority identity groups. Individuals withless commonly described sexual identities, including asexualand another sexual orientation, who had either a feminineor gender expansive experience of gender had lower odds ofreporting past-year binge alcohol use compared to femininelesbian participants. Both feminine queer individuals andfeminine individuals with another sexual orientation hadhigher odds of reporting past-year marijuana use comparedto feminine lesbian participants. Similar patterns were foundwhen modeling gender exclusively. This study demonstratedsubstance use heterogeneity in transmasculine, transfemi-nine, and genderqueer individuals as well as persons withanother gender. Results indicate that not all gender minoritygroups use substances in a similar manner.To date, literature on this topic suggests that substanceuse within SGM groups is higher than heterosexual, cisgen-der populations.3,6,8,9,26,27,41 However, this literature is lim-ited in the ways it has captured SGM status. Most priorstudies fail to consider within-group heterogeneity of sub-stance use across less commonly described sexual identitiesand rarely, if ever, examine substance use among non-cisgender individuals. Estimates of SGM substance use arealso often based on studies that examine substance use assecondary outcomes within specialized research populationsincluding commercial sex workers, intravenous drug users,community-based club and bar patrons, and unstablyhoused people.2,42–46 This may contribute to the potentialoverestimation of substance use within this population.Studies with carefully sampled populations also have limitedmeasurement of sexual orientation and gender. Recent datafrom the NSDUH indicated that risk for elevated substanceuse was not uniform across age- and gender-specific sexualminority subgroups for a variety of substance use out-comes.10,25 However, sexual identity assessment onlyincluded answer choice options of “Heterosexual, that is,straight,” “Lesbian or gay,” “Bisexual,” and “Don’t Know.”Analyses have been limited to comparisons of substance usebetween LGB men and women and their same-gender het-erosexual counterparts.10,25 Queer, pansexual, and asexualidentity groups remain mostly unaccounted. Little researchformally examines substance use differences between thesesubgroups and existing data is primarily descriptive.9,47,48Gender identity has also been inconsistently operational-ized. Most substance use literature does not include genderminority populations, and when included, these individualsare typically grouped into a single “transgender” label orseparated based on their sex assigned at birth and comparedto “non-transgender” individuals.23,49–52 In recent years,only one nationally representative survey of U.S. adults, the2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), includedadditional identity options if someone responded“Something Else” as their identity. These included: “You arenot straight, but identify with another label such as queer,trisexual, omnisexual, or pansexual,” or “You are trans-gender, transsexual, or gender variant.” 53 While over 2% ofNHIS survey respondents reported an identity of“Something Else,” “I don’t know the answer,” or refused torespond, prevalence data for these other, less-representedidentity groups were not reported. Additional identity110 B. T. BARGER ET AL.options are no longer included in more recent surveyiterations.54Continued characterization of substance use among lim-ited samples of SGM individuals fails to recognize the diver-sity of experiences within this community. Estimates ofsubstance use based on improper categorization of SGMidentity groups also limits our ability to design and targetculturally relevant and successful substance use awarenessand treatment interventions to those most at risk for ele-vated substance use. Our analyses show that examining sub-stance use across more granular categories of sexualorientation and gender, including less commonly describedidentity subgroups, is indicated. Overall group differences inreported substance use in models of both sexual orientationand gender suggest that these identity factors may haveindependent relationships with different substance use out-comes. While examining the association of minority stresswith substance use was outside the scope of this study,Meyer’s minority stress framework suggests that SGM sub-stance use differences may indicate differential responses tominority stress.13,20 Prior research suggests that, in additionto identity-based minority stressors, SGM youth experiencea higher rate of mental, physical, and emotional trauma(e.g., verbal and physical abuse,55–57 interpersonal violence,58victimization,55,59,60 homelessness61,62) compared to theirheterosexual, cisgender identified peers. While present analy-ses focus on characterizing substance use among adult SGMindividuals, it is important for future work to take intoaccount these early exposures to stress and trauma. Thereare notable gaps in research63,64 that examine how SGMcommunities experience trauma over the life-course - par-ticularly early experiences – and how that trauma may ormay not be related to and informed by SGM and otheridentity factors, and how exposure to different forms oftrauma impact access to and acceptability and use of sub-stances as tools for coping among SGM populations.65–67Future research examining substance use among less com-monly described SGM populations may elucidate why cer-tain identity groups have differential risk of substance usethan others.Given the different sociocultural circumstances in whichsubstance use occurs, future work should also take into con-sideration the historical contexts, current social situations,and public and private spaces (e.g., clubs, bars, PrideParades) in which members of SGM populations may haveincreased access to and be encouraged to use substances.For many, substance use may occur alongside communitybuilding and socializing with peers in spaces deemed safefor identity exploration and self-expression.65,68–71 Our find-ings underscore that multiple facets of SGM identity may beassociated with substance use. Including a broader spectrumof identities in this work not only helps legitimize thediverse lived experiences of SGM community members, butalso may provide a richer assessment of substance use inclinical and research venues.For example, screening for harmful alcohol use in health-care settings has been shown to increase referral to appro-priate treatment services and reduce the overall burden ofalcohol and other substance use on both individuals andcommunities.72 However, we note discrepancies in currentdefinitions of binge alcohol use, including the lack of valid-ation of these guidelines in both gender minority and sexualminority groups, which in turn, impacts clinical screeningfor harmful alcohol use within this population. Furtherwork that characterizes alcohol use and its consequencesamong a more diverse representation of sexual and genderminority individuals may contribute to changes in these def-initions and adapt guidelines toward more effective screen-ing and referral to treatment within this population. Inaddition, as marijuana gains both legal and popular accept-ance as a pharmacotherapy (e.g., for chronic pain73) and forrecreational use74 throughout different regions of the U.S., itis important to consider which communities may be mostat-risk of elevated marijuana use as a coping mechanism forstress and be targeted in marketing and advertising cam-paigns by manufactures of commercially-available marijuanaproducts.75–77 Last, as the opioid crisis continues to domin-ate public health focus, characterization of different forms ofsubstance use within a broader spectrum of sexual and gen-der identities may provide invaluable data on communitiesmost at-risk of drug use and would benefit from additionalpublic health intervention, treatment, and prevention pro-grams and services.Study limitationsThese findings should be interpreted with several limita-tions. First, we used data from iPhone users recruited viaconvenience sampling, which may limit the generalizabilityof these findings to all SGM adults. There was also a greaterrepresentation of young, well-educated, non-Hispanic/Latinowhite/Caucasian participants. Further research using a morerepresentative sample may support the results reported here.Second, some models in this study found no substance usedifferences between sexual orientation or gender subgroups,using lesbian individuals or cisgender women as respectivereference groups. These groups were chosen as a referencegiven past work that has identified these groups at particu-larly high risk of substance use among SGM commun-ities.11,39 While several models evidenced no differences,results from post-estimation Wald testing indicated that sex-ual orientation and gender still had statistically significantassociations with several substance use parameters. Sexualorientation was a significant predictor of self-reported prioralcohol use problems, past year binge alcohol and marijuanause, and previous 30-day marijuana use; gender categorywas a significant predictor of past-year and previous 30-daybinge alcohol use. Third, our use of the category “otherdrug use” precluded our ability to assess individualsubstance use and the reported number of days of single orpolysubstance use. Previous work, however, suggests thatpast-year use of these drugs for recreational purposes maycorrespond with an increased likelihood of a substance usedisorder.1 Fourth, alcohol use assessment was limited tobinge drinking behavior (i.e., 5 or more drinks on one occa-sion) and did not measure other quantities of alcoholSUBSTANCE ABUSE 111consumption. However, this decision was based on currentguidelines from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse andAlcoholism (NIAAA) that define binge alcohol use as“consumption within about 2 hours of 4 or more drinks forwomen and 5 or more drinks for men.”38 The distinction inbinge alcohol use between men and women has recentlybeen brought into question,78,79 and neither NIAAA norSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrationprovides a clear difference in sex- or gender-based differen-ces in binge alcohol use. There are also no binge alcohol useguidelines for gender minority groups. Therefore, the max-imum criterion of 5 drinks on one occasion was usedregardless of sex or gender identity. Finally, we used self-reported current sexual orientation and gender and did notmeasure other facets of SGM status (e.g., sexual behavior/attraction or gender expression/presentation). Due to thesocial complexity of describing sexual and gender identity,including evolving terminologies and variation in identityfactors by age, cultural background, and location overtime,80–83 results may not be representative of all individualsof this population.ConclusionsLimitations notwithstanding, this study found substance usedifferences by sexual orientation and gender within a large,national cohort of self-identified SGM people. Substance usevaried by SGM identities, including subgroups that have notbeen previously represented in substance use research.Differences were observed across multiple substance useparameters, including reported prior problems with sub-stance use and frequency of binge alcohol, marijuana, andother drug use. Given limitations in current research, theseresults highlight the need for future substance use researchacross populations, including less commonly described sex-ual orientations and genders. More thorough assessmentand characterization of substance use within this populationwould help contribute to much faster and effective publichealth intervention, treatment, and prevention of substanceuse within an already marginalized community. In addition,characterizing differential patterns of substance use withinthis population helps recognize that the diverse, heteroge-neous set of lived experiences within this community do notall contribute to the same or similar relationships to sub-stance use. Future research in this area should take specialconsideration of the SGM community groups that have his-torically been excluded from this work including trans-gender, gender expansive, asexual, pansexual, and queergroups, and how concepts like sexual orientation and genderinteract with one another in community settings to informdifferential experiences with substance use noted here.AcknowledgementsThe PRIDE Study is a community-engaged research project that servesand is made possible by LGBTQþ community involvement at multiplepoints in the research process, including the dissemination of findings.We acknowledge the courage and dedication of The PRIDE Study par-ticipants for sharing their stories; the careful attention of PRIDEnetParticipant Advisory Committee (PAC) members for reviewing andimproving every study application; and the enthusiastic engagement ofPRIDEnet Ambassadors and Community Partners for bringingthoughtful perspectives as well as promoting enrollment and dissemi-nating findings.

    "abstract": "Background: Profiles of substance use among less commonly described subgroups of sexual and gender minority (SGM) people (e.g., queer, genderqueer) remain largely unknown. Objective(s): To identify substance use differences among less commonly described SGM identity-based subgroups. Methods: The PRIDE Study is a national, online, longitudinal cohort study of self-identified SGM adults living in the U.S. Between 2015–2017, an iPhone application was used to administer three cross-sectional health questionnaires to participants, one of which included questions about binge alcohol, marijuana, and other drug use (substance use). This study was a secondary data analysis of participant responses to substance use survey items. Logistic regression and generalized linear modeling assessed relationships between sexual orientation or gender and use of or reported problems with substances within the past year. Results: Among the 1790 participants included in this study, 51.0% reported binge alcohol use, 39.8% reported marijuana use, and 19.7% reported other drug use (65.9% endorsed use of one or more of these) within the past year. Over 30% indicated substance use had been a problem in their life. Asexual individuals had lower odds of reporting past year binge alcohol and marijuana use (aOR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.12–0.61; aOR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.15–0.96, respectively), and queer participants had higher odds of reporting past year marijuana use (aOR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.58–4.03) compared to lesbian participants. Gender nonbinary participants had lower odds of reporting past year binge alcohol use (aOR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.32–0.71) and transmasculine participants had higher odds of reporting past year marijuana use (aOR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.10–4.31) compared to cisgender women. Conclusions: Substance use heterogeneity exists between SGM groups. Comprehensive assessment of sexual orientation and gender may improve understanding of substance use and increase equity within support and treatment services for SGM populations.Highlights We examined substance use among less represented sexual and gender minority groups. Alcohol and other drug use were examined by both sexual orientation and gender identity. Analyses included identities such as queer, pansexual, genderqueer and nonbinary. Alcohol use differed across asexual, genderqueer and gender nonbinary groups. Marijuana use differed across queer, asexual and transmasculine groups",
