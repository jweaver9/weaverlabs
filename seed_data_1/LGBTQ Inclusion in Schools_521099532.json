Research continues to suggest thatqueer young people experience higher rates of depression, anxiety and self-harm compared totheir heterosexual peers (Goldbach and Gibbs, 2017). Evidence also indicates that they are morelikely to attempt suicide (Marshal et al., 2011) and experience eating disorders (Austin et al., 2013).We hoped that the Research Topic would engage with the multitude of stories that represent thediversity of LGBTQ+ lives as lived and the authors of the papers are globally situated and unitedaround “flipping the (normative) script to survive” (Giroux, 2015).The authors in this Research Topic narrate a contemporary account of the social realitiesas experienced by LGBTQ+ individuals and their allies, and in doing so rewrite the dominantnarratives so often expressed in and by minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003) which considers howstress can affect the mental health outcomes in individuals with a minority status. The ResearchTopic engages with a critical reorientation to the field to elucidate how minority status can exposeQueer individuals and their allies to three stressors:• General stressors: These are stressors which result from environmental circumstances. Theycould include family factors such as parental conflict, parental separation, abuse and neglectand community-related factors such as social deprivation.• Distal stressors: These are stressors which arise from the experience of prejudice, discriminationand violence.• Proximal stressors: These are stressors which arise from the expectations of rejection, prejudice,discrimination and violence. That is, an individual with a minority status does not have toactually experience distal stressors but the anticipation that they might encounter these stressorsin different social and environmental contexts can result in psychological distress, concealmentand internalized homophobia. For example, they may anticipate that they will encounterprejudice if they disclose their sexual or gender identity. This can lead to students concealingtheir identities, which can result in internalized stigma.It is important to acknowledge that while much progress has been made for LGBTQ+ inclusionto become widely recognized and accepted as the “norm” that there still remains, for many young4Glazzard and Vicars Editorial: LGBT Inclusion in SchoolsQueer, Non-Binary and LGBT individuals, negative social andcultural experiences when disclosing their identities (distalstressors) which may increase expectations of further rejection(proximal stressors) in different contexts (Goldbach and Gibbs,2017). Additionally, concealing one’s identity due to fear ofrejection (proximal stressor) can reduce the likelihood ofexperiencing prejudice, discrimination and violence (distalstressor) (Goldbach and Gibbs, 2017). Thus, the stressors areinter-related and bi-directional. Meyer’s theory suggests thatthe stressors can be moderated by social support systems thatare specifically established to foster both group solidarity andpositively affirm minority identities. Many schools now provide“safe spaces” for students who identify as LGBTQ+ to meetinformally. These groups enable students to provide one anotherwith mutual support and advice. Some groups also adopt aproactive approach to LGBTQ+ inclusion within the schoolby developing initiatives to embed LGBTQ+ inclusion intothe curriculum and the environment. Providing opportunitiesfor queer students to meet as a group can enhance socialconnectivity, reduce internalized stigma and increase resilience.However, there is also a risk that separating out one group ofstudents in this way can also result in internal exclusion thoughthe creation of an “othered” group. One way of addressing this isto allow membership of the group to heterosexual allies who aredeeply committed to LGBTQ+ inclusion.This Research Topic aims to extend existing scholarshipin the field in the tradition of Waller (1932), Lawrence-Lightfoot (1983) and Cutuly (1993) and draws on quotidianportraits that account for the multiplicity of ways in whichLGBTQ+ individuals, including students, teachers andallies, juggle the complexity of competing personal andprofessional demands whilst facing moral and ethicalconflicts within their institutions. Darder (2011, p. 238) hasnoted how[Queer} bodies are . . . restricted, alienated, and domesticated. . . ,[and] are often under enormous pressure to follow strict policiesand procedures for classroom conduct.Adolescence is also a critical time during which young peopleexplore their sexual and gender identities and research indicatesthat stigmatizing experiences during adolescence can reduceacademic achievement and result in negative outcomes later inlife (Radkowsky and Siegel, 1997). Prior to disclosure, LGBTQ+young people may have experienced psychological distress frominternalized stigma, particularly as they are coming to termswith their sexual or gender identities. The anticipation that theirdisclosure might be met with hostility or disgust can result in fearof disclosure (proximal stressor) and concealment of identities.The process of “coming out” can result in exposure toboth proximal and distal stressors for young people andthe authors in this Research Topic address how individualand personal experiences (can critically) orient and providevaluable insight into effective strategies for coping (or not) withprofessional/ personal obstacles and adversity and stigma. Theauthors, in narrating the pedagogy of the “abjected,” offer upanother lens, a different worldview which is a significant criticalpresence of interruption in the contemporary performativity ofheteropatriarchal and cis gender normativitites. Goodson andGill (2011) have noted that when narratives of (normative)performativity are entrenched, disruption and provocation arerequired and in speaking back a truth to power. In this ResearchTopic, we have endeavored to (re)present a kaleidoscopic insightinto the social and cultural landscapes in which we live asGay, Queer, Trans, Non-Binary and Two Spirit people tochallenge the tidal cacophony of those who would rather have usremain silent.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAll authors listed have made a substantial, direct, andintellectual contribution to the work and approved itfor publication.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe wish to thank all contributors to this Research Topic.REFERENCESAustin, S.

Research has begun to identify theimportant role that knowledge and attitudes of health and educational professionalsmay play in providing a supportive, healing context to combat the harmful effectsof this discrimination and how educational trainings may foster improved knowledgeand attitudes in helping professions. This study describes a program to improveknowledge and positive attitudes toward gender and especially transgender people inuniversity students who study Social Education. The researchers measured knowledgeand attitudes toward gender and transgender people issues of 64 students beforeand after receiving a 4-month interactive training. They used the Short Form of theGenderism and Transphobia Scale, a 12-item scale of transphobia and gender ideologyvariables. The researchers also asked participants about their knowledge of gender andtransgender issues before and after training. The methodological experience “CreativeFactory” was employed as an interactive training program. The main goal of thismethodology is to enable students in a formative context to analyze social realities togenerate discussion and innovate ideas to design successful practices. After 4 monthsof training with a weekly session on gender and transgender learning, students showedimprovements in knowledge and attitudes toward both gender and transgender people.Specifically, students demonstrated more knowledge about gender and transgenderissues and more positive attitudes toward transgender people. The study demonstratesthat training in gender education using the Creative Factory methodology improvedknowledge and attitudes in students.Keywords: transgender people, attitudes, sexual education, social education, social changeFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 March 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 3677fpsyg-11-00367 March 13, 2020 Time: 16:12 # 2Gorrotxategi et al. Improvements in Transgender KnowledgeINTRODUCTIONThe European Union (EU) states in Article 1 of the Charterof Fundamental Rights (2011) that human dignity must berespected and protected. Article 21 of the same Charter censorsdiscrimination on the basis of gender and sexual orientationand in the same year resolution 17/19 recognizes the rights ofthe LGBT community for the first time including lesbian, gay,bisexual, and transgender people (DePalma and Cebreiro, 2018).Transgender is a general term in which people living their dailylives feel and live as the opposite gender to the one associatedwith the sex assigned to them at birth (American PsychiatricAssociation [APA], 2019). The term “transgender” refers to awide range of social identities and gender presentations (Billard,2018). In a study conducted in the United States, transgenderpeople were classified into three groups: (1) people who wereassigned as men at birth who felt they were women, (2) peoplewho were assigned as women at birth who felt they were men,and (3) those who did not identify as men or women (Factor andRothblum, 2008). In the last decade in particular, there is growingevidence that, in fact, there is a considerable group of people whodo not identify as trans binaries (Motmans et al., 2019).Transgender people can be subject to severe violencethough virtually all are subject to significant and harmfulmicroaggressions and transphobic prejudice (Grant et al., 2011).Transphobia refers to negative beliefs and attitudes abouttransgender people, including aversion and irrational fear ofmasculine women, feminine men, transvestites, transgender, ortranssexuals (Hill and Willoughby, 2005). The transgender grouphas historically been a marginalized group, and although todaytransgender people are more accepted by society, many healthand mental health professionals (physicians, psychologists, socialeducators) either do not have knowledge or positive attitudes anddo not believe that they are qualified to provide care servicesto transgender people and therefore avoid doing so (Kanamoriand Cornelius-White, 2016, 2017). There is some evidence thatgender expression, perhaps more so than mere sexual orientationor gender identity, may be a factor in the prejudice peopleexperience. While transprejudice is clearly higher among malesthan females and heterosexuals than LGBT people, there is alsoevidence that transgender people may be marginalized withinthe LGBT community when they violate traditional gender roles(Salvati et al., 2018a,b).It is therefore important for helping professionals who are incontact with transgender people to gain successful educationaland training experiences to become familiar with the trans historyand culture and demonstrate better interaction patterns withtransgender people. It is crucial to design and test interventionswith such professionals, preferably early in their training such asduring university.Literature ReviewTransphobic Attitudes in GeneralThere is a plethora of research that has been done in thecontext of gender studies has been on research on sexism andhomophobia. And although there are more and more studies thathave been conducted on the prejudices that exist against peoplewith transgender identities (e.g., Grant et al., 2011; Morison et al.,2018), comprehensive studies targeting the general transgenderpopulation are still lacking (Scandurra et al., 2019). Likewise,there is also budding body of research investigating in particularthe attitudes of helping professionals toward transgender persons(e.g., Kanamori et al., 2017; Stryker et al., 2019). While most ofthese studies are conducted with English-speaking samples, moreresearch is needed with Spanish-speaking samples because theyare not many (e.g., Carrera-Fernández et al., 2013) and nonespecially concerning knowledge and attitudes toward transgenderpersons within the ranks of social educators.In a general population study of attitudes toward transgenderpeople with 668 people, the results showed that a majoritysupported the possibility of transsexuals undergoing sexreassignment; however, 63% thought that the individual shouldbear the corresponding costs. In addition, a majority supportedthe right of transgender people to marry in their new sex andtheir right to work with children. The right of transgender peopleto adopt and raise children was supported by 43%, while 41%opposed it. The results indicated that those who believe thattranssexuality is caused by biological factors had a less restrictiveview of transsexuality than people who carry out a psychologicalview. Men and the older age group were found to have a morerestrictive view of these issues than women and the younger agegroup (Landén and Innala, 2000). This finding has also beenfound in other studies, where higher scores have been foundin men than in women in terms of transphobia (Nagoshi et al.,2008; Norton and Herek, 2013; Elischberger et al., 2016).As an example of a study concerned with family relations andtransphobia, Factor and Rothblum (2008) compared transgenderpeople to their non-transgender siblings, and found thatgroups of transgender people experienced significantly less socialsupport from their family than their non-transgender siblings.Transgender people also experienced more harassment anddiscrimination than their non-transgender brothers and sisters.Another study by Lombardi et al. (2001) investigated theprevalence of transgender people who had experienced violenceand discrimination. In their study they found that 60% of therespondents reported being victims of harassment by strangerson the street, verbal abuse, assault with a weapon and/or sexualassault. More than one-third (37%) of respondents also reportedbeing disciplined at work, being degraded or treated unfairly,being fired and, consequently, experiencing economic problems(Hill and Willoughby, 2005).Although there is evidence that transgender people receivenegative attitudes and transphobia from different groups,there are populations in which studies of attitudes towardtransgender people demonstrate positive attitudes. Studies withhealth professionals and feminist communities show thatthese are populations with generally more positive attitudestoward transgender people (Franzini and Casinelli, 1986;Kendel et al., 1997).A study by Kanamori and Cornelius-White (2016) showedresults consistent with the studies mentioned so far. In their studythey found that health professionals in general maintain generallyfavorable attitudes toward transgender people. The study alsoFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 3678fpsyg-11-00367 March 13, 2020 Time: 16:12 # 3Gorrotxategi et al. Improvements in Transgender Knowledgefound gender differences in attitudes consistent with manyprevious findings, finding that women showed more acceptedattitudes toward transgender people than men.Context of Transphobia in Spain for EducationalInterventionsGiven the need for studies with Spanish-speaking populationsand the site of this study in Spain, this section will reviewthe context that have been carried out on transphobia towardthose that identify as transexual thanks to different contributionsfrom activism and academia in this region (Platero, 2014;Platero and Ortega, 2017).Within the educational framework, different studies confirmthe lack of attention to the issue, even though it is an issuethat matters to different collectives that work with transgenderpeople. For example, in medicine, where the framework for theinterpretation of transsexuality comes from, the National Centrefor LGBT Health Education offers educational programmes,resources and consultations to health care organizations withthe aim of optimizing quality and cost-effective medical care forlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people (NationalLGBT Health Education Center, 2019).Another organization for the visibility of transsexual minorsis the appearance of the Association of Families of TranssexualMinors, Chrysallis, which is fighting for society, health andschools to meet the needs of transsexual children on an equalfooting with cisexual children. To this end, they have made alist of about seventy schools they call transfriendly to facilitatethe path of minors. Among the educational needs of the minorsthe association points out the essential \"The training of allpersonnel related to the educational process, teachers, counselors,psychologists, assistants, social workers and management teams,as well as the training of students\" (Gavilán, 2015, p. 85).These examples reflect current social change in theinterpretation of gender and sexuality. However, much remainsto be done for these people to freely develop their identities.Various researches and studies indicate that, in the field offormal education, there are no training programs, and genderdiversity is an issue that is not contemplated when differentstudies detect the need to work with students. For example, theEuropean Union Agency for Fundamental Rigths [FRA], 2013),produced the largest set of empirical information with the LGBTcollective to date with 93,000 people over 18 years of age in theEU, where its highlighted that members of this community cannot be themselves in their daily lives. The results showed thefollowing data: 47% of respondents had felt discriminated againstor harassed because of their sexual orientation; more than 80%remembered negative comments or acts of bullying in the schoolenvironment and 67% of respondents stated that they hid theirsexual orientation in the school stage.In Spain, homophobic bullying has always been present inschools. INJUVE (2011) stressed that the homophobic collectiveimposes its law in classrooms in the face of the passivity ofother students and teachers. In this line, some authors highlightthe importance of the role of the observer as a facilitator ofabuse (Gini, 2006; Byers, 2013). A little later, in 2012/13, theEducation Commission of the Lesbian, Gay, Transsexual andBisexual Collective of Madrid (COGAM) together with theState Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Transsexuals and Bisexuals(FELGTB) carried out a study on sexual diversity in theclassrooms where the results showed that of 653 children under25 years of age who acknowledged having suffered bullyingbecause of sexual orientation, 43% had come to devise suicidehighlighting the failure of the school system (DePalma andCebreiro, 2018). Against this backdrop, Pichardo and Puche(2019) decide to focus on the attitude and practices of teachers inthe face of sexual diversity. The results show that nursery, primaryand secondary school teachers think that not being heterosexualor skipping gender traits or traits related to appearance arethe reasons that generate the most insults or rejection. As wehave read in the previous point, gender is also a variable wheremen are more likely to insult and less likely to ask for helpand women are more likely to face issues of diversity andcoexistence in the classroom. Finally, there is a constant demandfor training on the part of the actors involved, both for teachersand students, since both groups are victims of discrimination(insults, mockery, exclusion) due to their personal characteristics(Pichardo and Puche, 2019).In this path of discrimination prior to the university stage,schools do not guarantee measures against the stigmatizationand marginalization of these people where the educationaldimension of heterosexual and patriarchal norms continues(Elipe et al., 2017; Alegre, 2018). In the universities thepanorama is not better either, the forms of identity and thenew considerations associated to the inclusion of sexual diversitycontinue being a pending subject due to the strong culturalroots and the gender binarism. In addition, the concept ofuniversity is historical and maintains its essence, its raisond’être transcends all time, place or social circumstance withoutreforms prevailing (Medina, 2005). Proof of this is thatdespite the fact that different media such as literature, cinema,plastic and audiovisual arts or advertising have introducedtranssexual experiences in the educational sphere, the samedoes not happen in the academic sphere where there isa generalized misinformation about the LGBT+ community(Castro and Ramos, 2019). Basque ley 09/2019, of 29 June1(Spain), includes in its articles 16 and 17 the obligation toincorporate methods, curricula and educational resources thatserve to increase understanding and respect for the diversity ofgender identities by dictating actions in matters of transsexuality.However, this law only works for basic education reflectinguniversity absence.Faced with this panorama, the university responds toheternormativity that is structured in a dichotomous systemof male-fall-masculine and female-vulva-feminine. Therefore,LGBT people continue to be constructed as minorities respectinga community of equals made up of heterosexual people. Thismeans that they are conceptualized from the discourse ofotherness and from a hegemonic and heteronormative position.What generates that the educational intervention reproducesdiscourses that consider these people as deficit, limiting them inagency (Galaz et al., 2016).1LEY 09/2019, de 29 de junio, de no discriminación por motivos de identidad degénero y de reconocimiento de los derechos de las personas transexuales. (accessedOctober 24, 2019)Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 3679fpsyg-11-00367 March 13, 2020 Time: 16:12 # 4Gorrotxategi et al. Improvements in Transgender KnowledgeFaced with this situation, trans people exclude themselves,when choosing university studies they opt for training spacesperceived as safer and more respectful such as careers relatedto art, feminized (teaching or nursing) and humanities studiesand related to social change also attracts them. However, moremasculinized careers such as engineering or scientific-technicalones perceive them as less desirable. Despite the fact that in someuniversities there are associations of LGBT students, in general,the university is created as an androcentric and eurocentric spacethat strips itself of affectivity and focuses on science. Thus, theuniversity has become a space full of physical, bureaucratic andsymbolic barriers for LGBT people (Pichardo and Puche, 2019).The Creative Factory InterventionFor several years, the El Observatorio del Tercer Sector deBizkaia (OTSB) (Fundación EDE, 2016) has been developing thecreative factory (CF) methodology as an educational interventionthat generates reflections and innovative solutions to significantsocial problems and which aims to generate interaction betweendifferent agents. This proposal was born from the meeting ofpeople and collectives working for social transformation frommultiple fields, such as that of unaccompanied immigrants,people in processes of exclusion and with severe mental illness,mistreatment among peers or the response to violent behaviorin adolescents, among others. In this way, students reflect fromthe critical (social, political, systemic) to foster creativity in orderto respond to the integral development of the personality andto ensure that the educational institution is not content withmerely reproducing the social system, but fulfils its function oftransforming reality and that future professionals can developalternative strategies to respond to social demands (Rodrigoand Rodrigo, 2012). In addition, making use of creativity,professionals are able to adapt to new changing contexts andcan contribute significantly to society (Goñi, 2000; Chacónand Moncada, 2006). A recent study studying the creativityof university students concludes that students show greatercreativity after having fostered it in class (Caballero et al., 2019).The CF methodology has been applied since the 2011/2012academic year in the subject of General Didactics. We have basedand been inspired by the process carried out by Alonso andArandia (2014) but adapting it to the current group and makingmodifications. On this occasion, we introduce a growing topicrelating to transsexual persons, adapting the methodology to theneeds of the students after evaluation (2018/2019) for continuousimprovement. Although the subject of transgender people hasbeen introduced throughout the continuous assessment, themethodology of the CF is carried out through training sessionsconsist three seminars. That is to say, in order to deepen thetheme and offer more formation, the CF process is accompaniedby different interventions and educational activities throughoutthe 4-month period (September–December).Objective and HypothesisSocial educators work in many areas, with different vulnerablepopulations, including transgender populations. For this reason,the importance of training these professionals so that they canact and intervene in educational spaces as well as in family, workand community spaces is highlighted (Parcerisa-Aran and Forés,2003; Bas-Peña et al., 2014).It is therefore important to assess the level of knowledge ongender and transgender issues in Social Education students andto design educational models that train students in these issues. Inaddition, it is also important to know the attitudes that they havetoward transgender people since many times negative attitudesor concrete stereotypes are given from ignorance. Education isone of the basic tools for students to get to know this group andimprove their knowledge and attitudes.The main objectives of this study were, on the one hand,to measure the attitudes of social education students towardgender and transgender people, and on the other hand, tovalue the knowledge about transgender people in these students.And finally, to measure the changes in attitudes and knowledgeafter an education program in transgender people based on thecreative factory methodology.Hypotheses suggest that Social Education students wouldhave positive attitudes toward gender and transgender peopleprior to taking the course. Since students do not receivemuch information on gender and transgender issues duringtheir university studies, in terms of knowledge, it is expectedthat students will not have much knowledge on the subjectof transgender before taking the transgender training course.As other studies have shown, women are expected to havebetter attitudes than men toward transgender people. Finally,thanks to the creative factory methodology, improvements areexpected in both knowledge and attitudes toward gender andtransgender people.MATERIALS AND METHODSParticipantsThe sample was taken from second-year Social Education degreestudents in the Public University of the Basque Country (Leioa,Spain). The researchers offered them voluntary participation inthis study. 64 people participated in the study. The average age ofthe subjects was 20.23 years. 81% (52 people) of the participantswere women, 17% (11 people) were men and 2% (1 person) wasnot identified as either men or women.All the students participated on a voluntary basis, receivedinformation about the procedure of the investigationand gave their consent before participating in the study.Therefore, the procedure followed is approved by the EthicsCommittee respecting the Helsinki Declaration of the WorldMedical Association.Measures and InstrumentsThe Short Version of the Gender and TransphobiaScaleAs Billard (2018) says, so far, there are six published scalesfor measuring attitudes toward transgender people: the Genderand Transphobia Scale (GTS; Hill and Willoughby, 2005),Transphobia Scale (TS; Nagoshi et al., 2008), TransgenderAttitudes Scale (ATTI; Walch et al., 2012), Transgender Attitudesand Beliefs Scale (TABS; Kanamori et al., 2017), TransgenderFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 36710fpsyg-11-00367 March 13, 2020 Time: 16:12 # 5Gorrotxategi et al. Improvements in Transgender KnowledgePrejudice Scale (Case and Stewart, 2013) and TransprejudiceScale (for transgender women; Winter et al., 2009).The Gender and Transphobia scale is a scale developedand validated in Canada (GTS; Hill and Willoughby, 2005)and analyses negative attitudes toward trans people, includingtranssexuals, transgender, and transvestites. It assesses thecognitive (gender), affective (transphobia) and behavioral(gender attack) of the co-components mentioned. It is a scalethat has been translated and validated in several cultures.The scale used in this study is the short version of theGTS was validated in Spanish with a stable factor structure andadequate reliability (Carrera-Fernández et al., 2013). The brevityof the instrument saves time and increases the effectiveness ofthe evaluation processes. It is a test with good psychometricproperties. The Cronbach’s alpha of their corresponding subscaleindicated good psychometric properties. The scale showed goodreliability, with a α = 0.80 for Gender Bashing and a α = 0.83 forTransphobia = Genderism (Carrera-Fernández et al., 2013).The scale is a 12-item scale that measures the variables ofGender Bashing, transphobia and genderism. The genderismis a belief system based on a heteronormative social model.Genderism devalues people who do not adjust to their genderroles or whose sex is not consistent with their gender. Thetransphobia is the attitudinal component and this includesnegative feelings, aversion and fear of people who transgress therigid two-gender model. Gender bashing is the act of victimizinga person emotionally, physically, sexually, or verbally becausethey are transgender. It is the behavioral component of sexism(Carrera-Fernández et al., 2013).The first six items of the short version of the GTS measuresgender bashing and the last six transphobia and genderism.The answers are answered on a scale from 1 to 7 with thefollowing values: 1 is strongly agree, 2 agree, 3 somewhat agree, 4neutral, 5 somewhat disagree, 6 disagree and 7 Strongly disagree.Lower scores indicate a higher level of transphobic attitudes.The lowest score that can be obtained in these two factorswould be a 7, indicating high levels of gender bashing andtransphobia/genderism. The highest score that can be obtainedin these two factors would be a 42, indicating absence of genderbashing and transphobia/genderism.Scale to Measure Transgender Knowledge and OtherVariablesFor clarity and ease of administration, a single item measureemploying Llikert scale of 1 to 10 was used to self-assess students’knowledge of transgender people. Students had to evaluate theirknowledge about transgender people: 1 being a complete lack ofknowledge about the subject, and a 10 an optimal knowledgeabout the subject. The item was: my level of knowledge aboutwhat it means to be a transgender person is. The Likert scaleplaces each individual at a particular point of knowledge. Thisscale is used to help the respondent assess his or her knowledgeabout the topic being asked. It allows us to measure the degreeof knowledge that the respondent considers to have regarding aspecific topic (Ospina et al., 2005). Other variables collected werethe age and gender of the students answering the questionnaire.It was also asked if they personally know any people whoare transgender.ProcedureThe first step was to secure permission from the universityethics committee to carry out this research. The project tookplace in a Spanish University with a World ranking in the top500 universities within the undergraduate program of SocialEducation, which is composed of seven modules. Specifically,we are located in the subject of General Didactics belonging tothe third module called Foundation of Educational Processes,which is taught in the first 4-month period of the second-year (2019/2020).On the first day of class the students were informed aboutthe study, and the people who decided to voluntarily participatein the study completed the pre-tests using the google formsplatform. The questionnaires answered by the students wereanonymous and had to include a code in order to identify therelationship between the questionnaires carried out before andafter the educational intervention.After the training they retook the measures again.Data AnalysisThe data of the participants were collected through googleforms. To begin with, descriptive analyses were carried outfor sociodemographic data, transgender knowledge, and ShortVersion of the GTS results. Paired t-test for related samples werecalculated to compare the means between the test and retests inthe variables of knowledge about transgenderism, and the genderbashing and transphobia/genderism factors of the GTS. t-testswere also performed for independent samples to see differencesin Short version Gender and Transphobia Scale questionnairefactors between men and women. To analyze the data we usedthe program R-comander program and the results were reflectedin tables.RESULTSTable 1 shows different descriptive variables of the sample,including maximums, minimums, means, and number of peopleand percentages of men, women and non-binary persons amongthe participants. The data show that the average age of theparticipants was 20.23 years and that most of the participantswere women (81%).Knowledge about transgender issues is divided betweengroups that have scored less than 3, from 3 to 7, and morethan 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. Where 1 would be the minimumknowledge about transgender topics, and 10 would be theoptimal knowledge about transgender topics. Finally Table 1includes the number of people and the percentage of peoplewho had close relationships with transgender people, hadacquaintances (not close relationships), and those who didnot know transgender people. Most of the participants knewa transgendered person, although not necessarily (48%), andknowledge about transgender people was medium in mostparticipants (61%).Table 2 shows the comparison of means of knowledge abouttransgender people, gender bashing, and transphobia/genderismof the Short version Gender and Transphobia Scale between thetest and the retest according to the t-test for related samples.

In the gender bashing andtransphobia dimensions there were improvements althoughnot significant.The mean comparisons shown in Table 3 were made betweenpeople who defined themselves as women or men. The differencesbetween men and women in gender bashing were significant,with men having more gender bashing. There were no significantdifferences in transphobia. There was one person who did notdefine himself as either a man or a woman. But being onlyone is not representative to make a comparison of meansbetween different genders. Therefore we will describe below thecharacteristics of this person. The scores in gender bashing was42 and in transphobia 42 being the highest scores that can betaken on this scale and representing a very low level of bothfactors in this person.DISCUSSIONThe descriptive data show the characteristic data of the studentsof Social Education where the average age is around 20 years oldand the great majority of people are women. There was only oneperson who was not considered binary (neither male nor female).Throughout the study, the relevance of making the reality oftransgender people known has been justified in order to put anend to discriminatory attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, in socialeducation professionals whose socio-educational work promotesthe achievement of social change (Parcerisa-Aran and Forés,2003; Bas-Peña et al., 2014). The following is a review of theresults found and the explanations that justify these results withthe review of the scientific literature.The first objective of the study was to explore the level ofknowledge that students of the social education degree perceiveto have toward what it means to be a transgender person. Inthis research, only 34% believe they have optimal knowledge.Therefore, the hypothesis is fulfilled that the students wouldnot have much knowledge about this subject before havingreceived specific training. The previous evidence showed thelack of information about LGBT+ collectives in the academicfield (Castro and Ramos, 2019). As well as professionals incontact with transgender people, with a perception of positiveattitudes toward them, they did not feel qualified to respondto their needs due to the lack of training. Other researchstated that trans people when choosing university studies couldbe inclined toward degrees related to social change or thehumanities, perceiving them as more respectful and, therefore,safe environments (Pichardo and Puche, 2019). In our study,dealing with a humanities degree, it has been found that only25% of the participants say they know a transgender personclosely, while 27% say they do not know any transgenderperson. This underlines the importance of increasing knowledgeFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 March 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 36712fpsyg-11-00367 March 13, 2020 Time: 16:12 # 7Gorrotxategi et al.

Fortunately, there are populations such ashealth professionals and feminist communities that have positiveattitudes toward transgender people (Franzini and Casinelli,1986; Kendel et al., 1997). As has been observed in this study,social educators are also a population with positive attitudestoward this group. Considering that they are professionals whowork actively in different social contexts, their training on genderand transgender issues is important (Gavilán, 2015, p. 85).The second objective was to analyze the attitude of SocialEducation students toward transgender people. According tothe hypothesis of the study, it was expected to find positiveattitudes toward transgender people because of the sensitivityor respect that is expected of students in the degree ofsocial education toward disadvantaged groups. In this case,a fairly low transphobia and gender aggressiveness score wasfound, which is why this hypothesis was affirmed. Also in astudy with a sample of 668 people, positive attitudes towardtransgender people were found, such as the recognition of theright to adoption, among others (Landén and Innala, 2000).Fortunately, there are populations such as health professionalsand feminist communities that have positive attitudes towardtransgender people (Franzini and Casinelli, 1986; Kendel et al.,1997). From this study it can be deduced that the SocialEducation student body is also a population with positiveattitudes toward this group. Regarding negative attitudes, severalstudies have found that transgender people experience violenceand discrimination (Lombardi et al., 2001; Hill and Willoughby,2005), which prevents them from being able to behave accordingto their identity because of the inadequate treatment theyreceived (Hill and Willoughby, 2005; European Union Agencyfor Fundamental Rigths [FRA], 2013). This research showsthat 85 and 71%, respectively, of the mockery that has beendirected at women for showing a male aspect or behavior orat men for their female aspect or behavior, state that they havenot made any mockery and 92% have not behaved violentlytoward women for their male behavior or toward men fortheir female behavior. Aversion or fear of transgender people(e.g., male women and female men) are attitudes that arepart of transphobia (Hill and Willoughby, 2005) and needto be eliminated.In terms of gender differences, the results of this studyshow that men have lower scores than women on genderbashing and transphobia/genderism. Despite a small sampleof men compared to women, men showed significantly morediscriminatory responses than women on the gender bashingscale. The results also suggest there may be more transphobiain men than in women although the results are not statisticallysignificant. These findings coincide with other studies showingthat men have more transphobia than women (Landén andInnala, 2000; Nagoshi et al., 2008; Norton and Herek, 2013;Elischberger et al., 2016; Kanamori and Cornelius-White, 2016).In reference to the third objective, the aim was to study thechanges given in attitude and knowledge in the students ofSocial Education after receiving training on the transgendersubject. It was expected to find an improvement afterthe training through the creative factory methodology.This hypothesis has been partially fulfilled, given that nodifferences have been collected in the improvement ofattitudes toward the collective; one explanation may be thatfrom the beginning the average of transphobia and genderaggressiveness found was low and although in transphobiaan improvement is observed, this has not turned out tobe statistically significant. Range restriction (the mean wasalready very high on the scale, indicating low transphobia)may account for the finding, suggesting that future studiesshould use measures with a wider range that may be moresensitive to change.On the other hand, there has been a statistically significantdifference in the perceived knowledge on the subject oftransgender, having increased the knowledge after receivingthe training, so it can be stated that the training receivedhas made it possible for the participating students to increasetheir knowledge. In a previous investigation with studentsand teachers in the field of health, it was found that after atraining of 8 h the knowledge, attitudes and clinical preparationtoward people of sexual and gender minorities improved withrespect to the control group that had not received any training(Pratt-Chapman and Phillips, 2019). Thus, learning programson transgender issues improve both knowledge and attitudestoward transgender people. For this reason, the importanceof promoting training courses on gender and transgenderfor professionals so that they can act and intervene bothin educational spaces and in family, work and communityspaces (Parcerisa-Aran and Forés, 2003; Bas-Peña et al.,2014) is highlighted.This training program on gender and transgender hascreated a context of reflection and knowledge generationfor students using the creative factory methodology(OTS, 2016). This methodology makes use of creativityand, thanks to this, facilitates the capacity to adapt tonew changing contexts and can contribute significantlyto society (Goñi, 2000; Chacón and Moncada, 2006).In this study, it has been demonstrated that throughFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 March 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 36713fpsyg-11-00367 March 13, 2020 Time: 16:12 # 8Gorrotxategi et al. Improvements in Transgender Knowledgethe creative factory methodology, changes can be achieved bothin attitudes and in the students’ knowledge about gender andtransgender issues. This demonstrates that the methodology hasserved to improve knowledge on transgender issues.The current study is subject to several limitations. The useof a single item measure to measure the students’ perceptionof transgender knowledge is one obvious drawback as reliabilityand validity information are not available for the use of thismeasure. The lack of a control group and the small samplesize for a quantitative study offer further constraints for theinternal and external validity of the study. Future research couldemploy more validated measures, comparison groups using nointervention or other interventions to compare effectivenessand larger, more diverse Spanish speaking sample sizes. Futurelines of research also aim to collect information from universitystudents of different grades. In this way, it will be possible tocarry out a comparative analysis between students from differentdisciplines. Another future line of research is to carry out aqualitative study where the results are focused on the innovativecontributions of the students. In this case, an analysis of thegood practices and innovative ideas presented by the studentswill be carried out.As mentioned above, despite the importance of gendertraining for Social Education students, studies show that theyreceive little training on the subject (Bas-Peña et al., 2014). Anobjective for future studies is to continue creating this typeof training both at the Social Education level and at otherlevels for which it is even more necessary to develop skills inrelation to the relationship and treatment with people, in orderto continue promoting awareness and learning about gender andtransgender issues.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTThe datasets generated for this study are available on request tothe corresponding author.ETHICS STATEMENTThe studies involving human participants were reviewed andapproved by Ethics Committee for Research Related to HumanBeings (CEISH) of the University of the Basque Country.

By adopting a case study approach, we provide a critical analysis ofthese policies and of how stakeholders with familiarity and knowledge of trans-affirmativepolicies from two school boards in Ontario are making sense of their impact with respectto addressing trans inclusion in schools. As such, our study offers insight into twotrans-affirmative policies and their implications for both supporting transgender, gendernon-conforming and non-binary students and envisioning gender-expansive educationin the school system. We draw on interviews with key informants—two teachers and aschool board official—as a basis for reflecting on the need to move beyond a discourse ofaccommodation in trans inclusive policies to one that explicitly articulates a pedagogicalcommitment to gender justice and gender democratization in schools.Keywords: gender justice, gender democratization, trans-affirmative policy, transgender, trans inclusion, genderdiversity, transgender students, non-binaryINTRODUCTIONIn this article we provide a critical analysis of trans-affirmative policies from two school boardsin Ontario and examine their implications with respect to supporting transgender and genderdiverse students in the education system. This focus is important in light of the high rates ofharassment, victimization, absenteeism, and suicide among transgender and gender diverse youthin schools that are documented in the existing literature (Wyss, 2004; Greytak et al., 2009; Tayloret al., 2011; Egale, 2012; Human Rights Campaign Gender Spectrum, 2018). Our purpose is togenerate knowledge and understanding about how to best support trans and non-binary youth inschools by undertaking a critical policy analysis that addresses the limits of accommodation and thenecessity of embracing gender democratization through pedagogical and curricular intervention(Youth Gender Action Project, 2009; Martino and Cumming-Potvin, 2016, 2019; Smith and Payne,2016; Frohard-Dourlent, 2018; Luecke, 2018). Hence, our study contributes to an emerging body oftrans-focused scholarship that is concerned to address gender diversity and transgender inclusionin the education system (Greytak et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2013; Millei and Cliff, 2014; Payne andSmith, 2014; Frohard-Dourlent, 2016; Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017; Ullman, 2017; Goodrich andBarnard, 2018; Leonardi and Staley, 2018; Sinclair andGilbert, 2018; Slater et al., 2018; Carlile, 2019;Kjaran, 2019; Martino and Cumming-Potvin, 2019). Firstly, we outline our approach to criticalpolicy analysis and explicate a trans-informed framework for understanding our approach toaddressing gender diversity in the education system more broadly before examining the particular16Omercajic and Martino Supporting Transgender Inclusion in Schoolsschool board policies in question. We then go on to present theviewpoints of three key informants who provide further insightinto these policies and trans inclusion in schools.FRAMING APPROACH TO POLICYANALYSISWe initially consider these policies through Bacchi’s lens ofproblematization and “the way in which the ‘problem’ isrepresented [which ultimately] carries all sorts of implications forhow the issue is thought about and for how the people involvedare treated” (Bacchi, 2009, p. 1). Bacchi’s (2009) approach buildsupon Foucauldian principles of subjectification and inquires howthe subject comes to be constructed and constituted throughpolicy (p. 16). She argues that in conceiving of policy asdiscourse the “emphasis . . . is upon the ways in which language,and more broadly, discourse sets limits upon what can besaid” (Bacchi, 2000, p. 48). Bacchi further elaborates that thisapproach to critical policy analysis is about “recogniz[ing] thenon-innocence of how ‘problems’ get framed within proposals,how the frames will affect what can be thought about andhow this affects possibilities for action” (p. 50). Hence, we areconcerned to draw attention to the limits of how specific schoolboard policies construct the problem of the trans subject as anobject of intervention with respect to articulating specificallythe conditions necessary for supporting trans youth, and morebroadly, gender diversity in the education system. It is the policyframes informing the production of these texts, which rely on afundamental logics of accommodation as a basis for addressingthe problem of the need for trans inclusion, that is a critical focusin our analysis of these texts.Relatedly, we also draw on Ball’s (1993) framing of “policy astext” with its interpretive repertoires that are products of multipleagendas and compromises which are enmeshed in networksof governance with their specific contingencies and shiftingconditions of emergence. For example, given that policies are(multi)authored and read and enacted in a variety of settings, it isimportant to understand that: “Few policies arrive fully formedand the process of policy enactment also involve ad-hockery,borrowing, re-ordering, displacing, making do and re-invention[. . . ] The onus is on schools to ‘make’ sense of policy where(sometimes) none is self-evident” (Ball, 1993, p. 8). Moreover,each stakeholder may interpret a policy differently, and so thewritten text does not necessarily result in the same actions beingundertaken by each school. Important questions related to howpolicies are read and interpreted, their priority, the environmentthey enter, and the motivation of stakeholders to enact them needto be considered. Hence, in this article we investigate how severalstakeholders with familiarity and knowledge of trans-affirmativepolicies within the context of their respective school board/schoolare making sense of these policies, and how their insights mightbe utilized to further inform possibilities for addressing transinclusion and gender diversity in the education system.Overall, we underscore the importance of policy as discourse,which considers not only what policymakers choose toincorporate in policy, but also that which they do not thinkabout or deliberately choose to exclude, underscoring that policyis not simply just text, but embedded in the exercise of powerthrough “a production of truth and knowledge, as discourses’(Ball, 1994, p. 21). As such we draw attention to the ways inwhich policy texts constitute the terms of trans inclusion andsupport for transgender youth in schools and how such texts areinterpreted by key stakeholders such as educators in schools, whoare the targeted recipients of these policies. In this regard, weinvestigate the extent to which transgender inclusion and supportfor trans youth are understood to be “spoken by policies” (Ball,1994, p. 22).TRANS-INFORMED THEORETICALFRAMEWORKSWe draw specifically on trans-informed theoretical frameworkswhich inform both our understanding of trans inclusion andpolicy governance. For example, Spade (2015), trans law scholarand activist, argues that attention needs to be directed to theadministration of trans polices rather than focusing just on the“law” or policy itself as a basis for investigating their impact withrespect to addressing trans inclusion and gender diversity. Thisfocus on the administrative aspects of governance does not denythe need for human rights legislation and policy development,but rather, directs attention to learning more about how suchpolicy frames relate or rather translate into enhancing “transwell-being” and gender diversity in schools (Ashley, 2018, p. 1).Indeed, Spade advocates for a shift in focus from an individualhuman rights framing of discrimination to one that addressesmore broadly regimes of gender classification and categorization:“Such a shift requires us to examine how administrative norms orregularities create structured insecurity and (mal)distribute lifechances across populations” (p. 9). In this respect, as part of ourcase study we provide a snapshot into how three key informantsare making sense of the policy and what the implications are forcreating spaces in schools for addressing trans marginalizationand gender expansive education (Ullman, 2017; Cumming-Potvin and Martino, 2018).Such a trans-informed analytic perspective is important as ithas the capacity to inform our understanding of how transgenderinclusivity and gender diversity are being considered in educationpolicy contexts, with implications for addressing the erasure andinvisibility of trans lives. This focus is necessary given Namaste’s(2000) explanation that erasure is “a defining condition” oftrans people’s lives (p. 4). In fact, Stryker (2006), argues for aTransgender Studies focus that addressesanything that disrupts, denaturalizes, rearticulates, andmakes visible the normative linkages we generally assumeto exist between the biological specificity of the sexuallydifferentiated human body, the social roles, and statuses that aparticular form of body is expected to occupy, the subjectivelyexperienced relationship between the gendered sense of selfand social expectations of gender-role performance, and thecultural mechanisms that work to sustain or thwart specificconfigurations of gendered personhood (p. 3).Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 2717Omercajic and Martino Supporting Transgender Inclusion in SchoolsHence, we are interested in understanding how a trans-informed critical analysis might be interwoven in trans-affirmative policies, along with a commitment to addressing theimpact and effects of “assumptions regarding sex and gender,biology and culture. . . ” (Stryker and Aren, 2013, p. 3).This commitment entails unpacking the ways in which genderand non-binary classifications are administratively addressedin these policies to better understand how they perpetuate orminimize the “vector of violence and diminished life changes”for transgender and gender diverse youth in schools (Spade,2015, p. 142). As such, we examine how the recognition oftransgender personhood and its livability are understood withinthe limits and possibilities that are circumscribed by trans-informed policies in the school system that rely on a fundamentallogics of accommodation. What knowledge about transgenderphenomena and gender diversity are articulated through suchtrans-inclusive policies and what are their implications forensuring gender justice and democratization in the educationsystem (Connell, 2009; Martino and Cumming-Potvin, 2018)?Such trans-informed frameworks on gender democratizationrequire a critical focus on the impact of cisgenderism andcisnormativity in schools which “refers to the cultural andsystemic ideology that denies, denigrates, or pathologizes self-identified gender identities that do not align with assigned genderat birth” (Lennon and Mistler, 2014, p. 63). These cisnormativeregimes of practice also reinforce what Rands (2009) refersto as the gender oppression matrix, which involves privilegingindividuals who conform to gender norms while punishingthose who transgress them. As such, Rands advocates for theneed to embrace gender complex frameworks in ways thatcomplement the trans epistemological underpinnings of thisstudy (Stryker, 2006; Martino and Cumming-Potvin, 2018). Inlight of this framing, we acknowledge that institutionalizationof cisgendersim in schools contributes to a cultural hegemonywhich privileges certain gender identities and forms ofembodiment over others (Spade, 2015; Nicolazzo, 2017c). AsConnell (2009) argues, there is a need to confront genderhierarchies and their effects which she envisions as a commitmentto gender democratization (p. 146). In this respect, genderdemocratization moves beyond the discourse of trans inclusivitythat relies solely on a fundamental logics of accommodationand liberal notions of human rights to address curricularand pedagogical reform that accounts for more expansive andequitable understandings of gender (Courvant, 2011; Martinoand Cumming-Potvin, 2015, 2018; Keenan, 2017).ABOUT THE STUDYWe chose to focus on two school boards which were the firstto develop trans-affirmative policies in Ontario and conductedsemi-structured interviews with one policymaker and twoeducators familiar with such policies. These school boards fallunder provincial jurisdiction whereby each province in Canada isresponsible for creating its own educational structures1. Canada’s1All school boards in Ontario are required to ensure that they meet the OntarioMinistry of Education’s equity stipulations in accordance with the Ontario Humanconstitution, known as The Constitution Act of 1867, stipulatesthat “[I]n and for each Province the Legislature may exclusivelymake Laws in relation to Education. . . ” (s. 93) 2. Legislationconsists of provincial statutes, along with bylaws and regulationsof local school boards or commissions that set out the division ofresponsibilities in the area of public instruction. School Board Ais one of the largest and most diverse in Canada, covering a largeurban center and serving a school population of over 200,000students. It was the first school board in the country to developa trans-affirmative policy in 2011, prior to the Ontario HumanRights Commission authorizing the inclusion of gender identityand gender expression as legislative grounds for discrimination in2012, underscoring a commitment to addressing trans inclusivityand gender diversity in their schools. School Board B is a smallerboard serving urban, suburban and rural communities in Ontariowith a population of over 74,000 students, which introduced atrans-affirmative policy in 2012. Firstly, we provide an overviewof these policies utilizing a trans-informed lens in analyzingtheir specific discursive articulations of trans-inclusivity. Wereflect on the insights regarding the limits of accommodationin trans-affirmative policy gleaned from the interviews with keyinformants from each of these boards. In this sense, our approachto analyzing these policies was informed by both Bacchi’s WPR(’What’s the ProblemRepresented to Be?’) approach, and StephenJ. Ball’s interrogation of policy as text and policy which drawattention to the interpretive aspects of highlighting the discursiveframes of accommodation that come to define the limits ofhow trans-informed understandings are articulated for schools.As such our overall critical analysis is specifically informed byour engagement with trans informed theoretical frameworksthat draw attention to the need to address more systemicmatters related to gender justice involving the institutionalizationof cisnormativity.We employed a case study design with the specificaim of “gather[ing] comprehensive, systematic, and in-depthinformation” (Patton, 2015, p. 536) about trans-affirmativepolicies. It was the attention directed not only to the examinationof the key roles by policymakers and stakeholders in the creationof these policies, but also the knowledge and perspectives ofeducators whose understandings of trans inclusivity were guidedby their knowledge of these policies that we were concerned toinvestigate. Inquiring about their interpretive understandings ofthe policies, therefore, lent itself to embracing a qualitative casestudy research design (Patton, 2015). In this respect, the studywas not conducted with the aim of generalizing about the impactRights Code. While provincially developed policies are to be enforced by allschool boards in the province, the policies developed by the school board are onlyimplemented by schools that fall within that board’s jurisdiction.2There is no Federal Department of Education in Canada. Educational policy inCanada is developed provincially and is specific to each provincial jurisdiction.Ontario is comprised of three branches of government: legislative, executive andjudicial. The executive branch is comprised of elected Members of ProvincialParliament (MPPs) who introduce policy for consideration in the Houseof Commons. The decisions made in Cabinet provide direction for policydevelopment and implementation in the Ontario Public Service (OPS). TheOPS is comprised of non-partisan staff who develop and implement policy. Thedevelopment of such policies can be instigated through the proposal of a bill by anMPP that may be encouraged by public opinion.Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 2718Omercajic and Martino Supporting Transgender Inclusion in Schoolsof such policies, but rather to generate knowledge about howsuch policies articulate understandings about trans inclusionsand with what political effects. The focus on key informantsthrough purposive and snowball sampling (Patton, 2015) allowedus to draw on the insights and experiences of the following threeparticipants who had either a hand in creating these texts, or first-hand experiences of their administration: Grace, a non-binaryindividual, had been a high school teacher of visual arts, Frenchand special education with School Board B for the past 5 years;Dean, a transgender man, who has been an elementary schoolteacher in School Board B for 29 years and Michael, a cisgendermale, with 17 years of administrative experience as an equityofficer, who contributed to the development of School BoardPolicy A. These participants were specifically selected due totheir knowledge and experience(s) with the policies we analyzed.They were selected through purposive and snowball samplingmeasures among the limited pool of administrators/educatorswho had experience or critical feedback specific to the policies. Inthis regard, they provided “in-depth knowledge about particularissues” (Patton, 2015, p. 219) and they were selected dueto their expertise regarding trans-affirmative policies in theirrespective school boards. Given the specific nature of case studyresearch, we were not so much concerned to generalize acrossa population of educators, but to provide an analytic focuson the particularity of the policies in question in light of theexisting literature in the field about the barriers to supportingtransgender inclusion and gender diversity in schools (Payneand Smith, 2014; Frohard-Dourlent, 2016; Meyer et al., 2016;Morgan and Taylor, 2018). All participants signed a consent formagreeing to both audio recording of the interviews and the non-identifying data being used in research publications. Teacherparticipants were asked to share their knowledge with respectto the policy in their school board. They were prompted toprovide their overall assessment and impressions of the trans-affirmative policy and what impacts—if any—they may have seenin their schools as a result of the policy. Policy creators wereasked how the policy came about, why they felt it was necessary,and how effective they believe the policy has been in achievingits purpose.A thematic analysis of the interview data was undertaken bymeans of “identifying, analyzing, and interpreting patterns ofmeaning” as a result of a constant reading and re-reading ofthe interview transcripts (Clarke and Braun, 2017, p. 297). Thesignificance of policy and curriculum as sites of intervention andthe limits of relying on a discourse of accommodation emergedas key themes that further enhanced our own interpretive andcritical examination of the trans inclusive policies that are thesubject of this article.TRANS-INCLUSIVE SCHOOL BOARDPOLICIES WITHIN THE ONTARIOLEGISLATIVE CONTEXTIn this section, we focus our attention on two specific schoolboard policy texts in question. Trans-informed policy analysis atthe local level of school boards in Ontario needs to be understoodas a response to broader legislative frameworks at the provinciallevel. For instance, gender identity and gender expression wereincluded in 2012 as part of the Ontario Human Rights Code(OHRC) (Ontario Human Rights Commission, 2012a). As aresult, Ontario became the first province in Canada to legallyrecognize the term “gender expression” (Kirkup, 2018, p. 109).Conversely, at the federal level there has been a struggle tointroduce similar grounds for discrimination. Bill C-16 (2016)—afederal government sponsored bill that prohibits discriminationon the basis of gender identity and gender expression—wasintroduced into the House of Commons in May 2016. In thissense, it is significant to understand that Ontario, as a province,has been far more progressive in its consideration of trans andgender diversity with respect to law and policy, and as such, sohave the provincially governed secular school boards (Martinoet al., 2019).School Board Policy A was released in 2012, the first transspecific school board policy of its kind in Canada (see Shanks andLester, 2019), and offers valuable considerations, ranging frompronoun usage, privacy, and structural accommodation(s) (i.e.,all-gender bathrooms and change rooms), with an emphasis onsafety and protecting the human rights of trans students. Bacchi(2009) encourages the start of any policy analysis to lead withthe question of what the problem is represented to be. In thiscase, the policy was created “to raise awareness and help protectagainst discrimination and harassment [and] fulfill a sharedobligation to promote the dignity and equality of those whosegender identity and or gender expression does not conform totraditional societal norms.” In order to address this problem, thepolicy emphasizes the need for accommodation, insisting thatits goal is to set out “best practices related to accommodationbased on gender identity and gender expression.”. The policyrelies on a fundamental discourse of accommodation as a basisfor both raising awareness about and addressing harassmentand discrimination of trans people in the education system.It indicates that schools must address “each student’s needsand concerns separately” and states that staff “should notdisclose a student’s transgender/gender non-conforming statusto others” or to “the student’s parent(s)/guardian(s)/caregiver(s)without the student’s explicit prior consent” unless necessary.This stipulation reflects a legal requirement as set out inthe Ontario Human Rights Code with regards to protectingand respecting confidentiality as it pertains to disclosure ofone’s transgender status (Ontario Human Rights Commission,2012b). The policy also emphasizes the student’s “right to beaddressed by a preferred name and pronouns correspondingto their gender identity.” In this capacity, the policy placesthe “student in charge” in an effort to demonstrate that theyare the “driver” of their own narrative (Frohard-Dourlent,2018, p. 332). However, while the policy endorses agency withrespect to pronoun usage, it does not explicitly address how tosustain these reiterative vocalizations of trans and non-binaryidentification and embodiment which are presented in termsof the individual right of the student to request such formsof address. In this respect, the policy omits the importanceof a continued commitment to these reiterative vocalizationsand maintains “the power relations that a discourse constructsFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 2719Omercajic and Martino Supporting Transgender Inclusion in Schoolsand allows,” rendering the cisnormative system primarilyunchallenged (Ball, 1994, p. 22).In fact, School Board Policy A seems to envision genderinclusivity to be fundamentally bound primarily to physicalaccommodation. The policy text sets its focus on the potentialfor the existence and inclusion of trans and gender diverse bodiesin physical spaces, specifically outlining individual proceduresto be taken into account with respect to student and staffrequests for accommodation. In fact, physical accommodationis foregrounded in the body of the document with its emphasison students having the right to “safe restroom facilities andthe right to use a washroom that best corresponds to thestudent’s gender identity, regardless of the student’s sex assignedat birth.” The policy explicitly addresses accommodation in thespace of physical education, which is typically gender segregated.Specifically, it insists that staff must ensure that “students canexercise their right to participate in gender-segregated [. . . ] classactivities in accordance with each student’s gender identity.”Accommodation in this area also emphasizes the right ofstudents “to a safe change-room that corresponds to their genderidentity.” However, the onus for such accommodation restswith the individual student requesting such a space. Thus, thefundamental discourse of accommodation governing the termsof trans inclusion in this policy is one which constitutes theindividual trans student as responsible for ensuring their ownsafety and well-being and requires them to basically be outin order to do so. Such a policy stipulation actually flies inthe face of research in Canada and elsewhere that shows thattrans students are particularly vulnerable to both verbal andphysical and harassment. Key findings from a national schoolclimate survey in Canada found that school climate was far morehostile and unwelcoming to transgender students: “[a]lmostthree-quarters (74%) of trans students reported being verballyharassed about their gender expression” (Taylor et al., 2011, 23).In fact, this study found that “trans students were more likely toreport hearing negative gender-related or transphobic commentsdaily or weekly from other students (89.8% of trans youth)”(p. 52) (see also Greytak et al., 2009). Concerning physicalharassment, Taylor et al. (2011) found that “trans students weremuch more likely than sexual minority or non-LGBTQ studentsto have been physically harassed or assaulted because of theirgender expression (37.1%)” (p. 64). They also investigated theextent to which schools responded and intervened to instancesof transphobia and that school-based policies paid “insufficientattention to the damaging effects of negative gender-relatedcomments on students, especially trans youth, who are mostoften the target of these remarks” (p. 117). In addition, the studyalso found that “nearly half (43.0%) of trans students reportedthat school staff members never intervened when homophobiccomments were being made” (p. 110).School Board Policy A does offer an acknowledgment ofthe importance of trans-inclusive content in teaching and inall subject areas, including a separate section that addresses“curriculum integration.” It calls for the need to address theerasure of transgender and gender non-conforming individualsfrom the curriculum which “creates a misconception amongmany students that transgender people do not exist and are anobject of scorn.” The policy also advocates for school boardand curriculum-based leaders to “integrate trans awarenessand trans positive advocacy training into staff professionaldevelopment curricula.” Such a consideration is important andunderscores Rands’ (2009) point that educators must be preparedadequately “to teach gender in more complex ways that take intoconsideration the existence and needs of transgender people”(p. 419). However, no accountability measures or allocation ofresources are actually stipulated to ensure such professionaland curricular development. In fact, in order to ensure thateducators are equipped to do this, School Board Policy Aplaces responsibility on librarians in schools to “acquire trans-positive fiction and non-fiction books for school libraries andencourage the circulation of books that teach about gendernon-conforming people.” If policy as text reflects policy asa product of compromises between different agendas andinterests, then this stipulation reads far more as a non-committalcompromise or formality rather than a devotion to followthrough on pedagogical and curricular development (Ball, 1994,17). “Different interpretations” (Ball, 1994, 17) of “trans-positive”books and what it means to “encourage the circulation of books”leaves this commitment relatively ambiguous.In conjunction with this stipulation, the policy text providesan appendix of resources for students and parents, ranging fromreading materials (which include handbooks about parentingtransgender and gender diverse children), online resources fortrans youth and their families, and also identifies support groupsfor trans youth. In this sense, the policy text is indirectly informedby research which indicates:Educators, policymakers, and safe school advocates mustcontinue to seek to understand the specific experiences oftransgender students, and implement measures to ensure thatschools are safe and inclusive environments for all LGBT youth.Given the potential positive impact of supportive educators,student clubs, curricular resources, and comprehensive anti-harassment policies on the school experiences of LGBT students,it is imperative that schools work to provide these resources tostudents. Along with providing access to LGBT-related resources,it is important for educators, advocates, and policymakers torecognize how the needs of transgender youth may both besimilar to and different from the needs of their non- transgenderpeers. Schools should explicitly address issues and experiencesspecific to transgender students (Greytak et al., 2009, p. 54–55).However, there is no explicit attention to addressing theinstitutionalization of cisgenderism as part of a boardercommitment to the educative “work that must be done tocreate classrooms that truly integrate trans lives into currentcurricula and classrooms” (Courvant, 2011, 26; Malatino, 2015;Keenan, 2017).Nevertheless, most of these practical examples and resourcesare reserved for the appendices in the policy text, while moregeneral assertions and assurances about curricular inclusionare reserved for the main text, as outlined above. As a result,there is an absence of any explication of how a trans-inclusivepedagogy and curriculum might be enacted or any specificallocation of resources to achieve such outcomes (Keenan, 2017).This is an important policy consideration for, as NicolazzoFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 5 April 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 2720Omercajic and Martino Supporting Transgender Inclusion in Schools(2017a) expresses, “just as trans∗ people need physical spaceto be themselves, we also need epistemological spaces of ourown to learn how we come to know ourselves and our worldsthrough gendered perspectives” (p. 7). In this respect, trans-specific policies need to move beyond a discourse of policiesfor transgender individuals toward policies that engage withthem and constructively consider how such integrations canrestructure a cisgenderist system in light of the provision ofnecessary supports and resources for principals and schools toensure that gender expansive education can be enacted (Mangin,2018).School Board Policy B, published in 2013, is closely modeledon and was adapted from School Board Policy A. However,instead of taking the opportunity to build on its predecessor,School Board Policy B copies word for word entire sections thatare lifted directly from the School Board Policy A with somealterations and omissions. In fact, one of the creators of SchoolBoard Policy A was consulted to help draft School Board PolicyB, likely due to the fact that the former school board is known forits reputation as a leader in equity and social justice education.The replication of policy documents from one context toanother emphasizes the act of what Phillips and Ochs (2004)refer to as policy borrowing, which is understood as the“conscious adoption in one context of policy observed inanother” (p. 774). It also highlights the board’s disengagementfrom the understanding that policy practices are “specific andcontextualized” and are “framed by the ethos and history ofeach school and by the positioning and personalities of thekey policy actors involved” (Braun et al., 2010, p. 558). Thisact of policy borrowing is evident from the introductory pageof School Board Policy B, where the policy uses the sameexcerpt from the Ontario Human Rights Code as School BoardPolicy A to detail the significance of providing “equal rightsand opportunities, and freedom from discrimination.” Thisinsertion highlights the exigency behind the need to respondto provincial legislation for ensuring the rights of genderminorities in public and state funded institutions. In this respect,there is a necessity for policy networks to coincide and valueintersecting identities that endure discrimination and not justone group; this reliance on the OHRC as a foundation mustgo further in underscoring the importance of intersectionalidentities and how these multiple vectors invite further issuesof harassment, discrimination and trans marginalization (Spade,2015). Moreover, the policy mirrors the representation of theproblem as outlined by School Board Policy A, suggesting thatit has been “designed to raise awareness and help protect againstdiscrimination and harassment.” While the problem presented(Bacchi, 2009) is understood in terms of ensuring protectionfrom harassment and discrimination, such a commitment isunderstood as enacting accommodation measures at the requestof the actual trans student. Ironically such a policy stipulationputs the student in the driving seat for ensuring their ownaccommodation with no specific accountability being requiredfor the actual system to take responsibility for trans inclusiveinterventions. Frohard-Dourlent (2018), e.g., argues that transinclusive policies and practices which rely on student led reformagendas are limited and that what is required is the need for moresystemic driven approaches that “do not require the presence oftrans bodies and instead offer possibilities for educational spacesin which all students would experience fewer pressures of genderand sexual conformity” (p. 328).School Board Policy B also borrows the section“accommodation based upon request” directly from SchoolBoard Policy A, but with significant omissions, speaking tohow policy as discourse emphasizes constraints imposed bydiscourse through the purposeful omission of select sections oftext (Ball, 1994; Bacchi and Eveline, 2010). Specifically, SchoolBoard Policy B does not highlight that “there is no age limit onmaking an accommodation request” or the suggestion to puta request “in writing for purposes of clarity” and protection,which begs the question of what the purpose of this intentionalomission might entail. However, it does offer specificity withrespect to contingency when it comes to unresolved requests andoutlines how both students and employees can respectively “seekrecourse” if they feel that their accommodation needs remainunmet. School Board Policy A does not offer such a potential toappeal accommodation measures. However, much like SchoolBoard Policy A, it continues to place the student in charge of theirown accommodation(s), assuming “that students have the powerand language to assert individual needs and identify solutions topotential conflicts” (Frohard-Dourlent, 2018, p. 338).It is significant that the section on trans curriculardevelopment and integration included in School Board PolicyA is omitted from the School Board Policy B text. Such anomission reflects an active decision not to address, explicitly, thecurricula necessity for elaborating the terms of what a “gender-complex education” might entail with its emphasis on ensuringthat educators and students are incessantly “aware of the ways inwhich the gender oppression matrix and heterosexism work intandem to privilege certain groups of people and oppress othersand take action to challenge the gender oppression matrix andheterosexism” (Rands, 2009, p. 426). By actively removing thispiece from the policy, the policy itself reaffirms a regime of truthin which support for challenging dominant, cisgender discourseswith respect to the provision of gender expansive education isnot specifically addressed. This aspect of what Ball (1994) refersto as “the processes of policy influence and text” highlights that“only certain influences and agendas are recognized as legitimate”(p. 17): “Policies do not normally tell you what to do, theycreate circumstances in which the range of options available indeciding what to do are narrowed or changed, or particular goalsor outcomes are set” (p. 19).In addition, while School Board Policy A encourages schoollibraries to include books and resources that deal with genderdiversity, this detail is also removed from and not acknowledgedin School Board Policy B. Dean, a trans educator, noted that evenwhen libraries do contain materials discussing gender diversity,they are not always visible nor physically attainable:I do know that my perfectly well-meaning, sweet, friendlylibrarian who used to be at my school would hit books that wereabout “sensitive topics,” like gay things, really high up so thatnone of the children could get at them. I mean, you now, theyounger children. Maybe the [grade] 7’s and 8’s might be able toreach them, if they looked in that area. It’s like we’re putting themFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 2721Omercajic and Martino Supporting Transgender Inclusion in Schoolsup without putting them up. We’ll put them up and never evertalk about them or encourage anybody to look over there.Dean’s insight demonstrates the lack of consideration—both in policy and practice—of how trans and gender diversestudents can exist epistemically and need to see themselvesreflected within the education system (Nicolazzo, 2017a; Martinoand Cumming-Potvin, 2018), nor does the policy account forstatistics that indicate that the inclusion of such resourcesminimizes rates of victimization (Greytak et al., 2009). Despiteremoving these curricular considerations from their replicatedpolicy text, School Board Policy B includes the same appendixabout making schools safer and more gender affirming places,without acknowledging how a trans-inclusive curriculum cancontribute to achieving these goals (Taylor et al., 2011).Dean accounts for the difficulty of attaining resources thataddress gender diversity. While Prosser (1998) notes thatexamining transgender narratives in curriculum will result inintroducing a more expansive discussion of gender and genderembodiment, leading to a deeper understanding of the spectrumof identities. Dean, however, noted that lack of access to trans-affirmative materials and resources, despite occasional efforts bythe Ministry of Education, serves as a great barrier to properlyimplementing a trans-inclusive curriculum:That’s always the thing where you say curriculum andmaterials, what can we come up with? And so, there are novelsthat we can find. And there’s been some great stuff written byETFO [The Elementary Teacher’s Federation of Ontario], youknow? [. . . ] But what happens is that the books. . . they have avery short market time. . . when they’re on queer topics. And so,you make this whole lesson plan or whatever it is. . . Resourcesbased on this book, and then you can’t get a hold of the book!In this respect, while resources may be recommended or listedin policy appendices for teachers to access in order to be inclusivein their pedagogy, acquiring these resources proves particularlydifficult in practice. Such a lack of access suggests that althoughpolicies are created to be inclusive and to accommodate transstudents, and to even “raise awareness,” such efforts fall flat dueto a lack of investment in resources and tools for curricularintervention. Despite the fact that ‘when teachers are given theopportunity and the resources, they welcome the challengespresented by GSD [gender and sexual diversity]’ (Bryan, 2012,p. 133), this remains an area where schools continue to fall shortbased on Dean’s experience.Commendably, both policies offer a consideration ofsex-segregated physical education (P.E.) classes and gendersegregation in other classes where the policy insists that“students shall be permitted to participate in accordance withtheir gender identity.” However, such a policy that is genderconsiderate does not encourage schools and their educatorsto avoid gender segregation for the purpose of class activitiesand as an overall pedagogical strategy for addressing trans andnon-binary inclusivity (Rands, 2009; Jackson, 2010; Ehrenhalt,2016). Overall, there is clearly an emphasis on the logics ofaccommodation in both policies which appears to be motivatedby and conceived in response to legislative requirementsin the Ontario context with no significant allocation ofresources and detailing of accountability measures forensuring professional and curriculum development for teachersin schools.INTERPRETIVE ACCOUNTS OFTRANS-INCLUSIVE POLICIESIn light of our focused analysis on the content andcontextualization of these school board policies in Ontario,we draw on conversations from key informants to reflect uponand generate insights into trans-inclusive policy developmentand discursive limits and possibilities of policy frames thatrely on a fundamental discourse of accommodation. Weconceptualize the accounts that are derived from interviews withour participants as snapshots because they provide a windowinto the response to these policies by educators at a certain placeand point in time. In this sense, they emphasize Ball’s (1994)point about “policy as discourse” and as “set within a movingdiscursive frame which articulates and constrains the possibilitiesand probabilities of interpretation and enactment” (p. 2). It is inthis sense that “the ‘effects’ of policy cannot simply be read offfrom texts,” and that it is essentially how they are interpreted byactors in schools that is equally an important consideration inpolicy analysis (Ball, 1994, p. 21): “A policy is both contested andchanging, always in a state of ‘becoming’, of ‘was’, and ‘not quite;‘for any text a plurality of readers must necessarily produce aplurality of readings’ (Codd, 1988, 239)” (Ball, 1994, p. 16).The Significance of Policy and Curriculumas Sites of InterventionEach participant questioned whether policy was enough tofoster more equitable conditions of access for transgenderand gender diverse students in the public education system,echoing Spade’s (2015) assertion that more is needed beyondthe mere human rights legislative and policy frameworks. Forexample, participants discussed the idea about the potential ofa trans-affirmative curriculum having a greater impact than theactual policy itself. Grace, a teacher of 5 years, was particularlyoptimistic about the current trans-affirmative policy, its currentsocial relevance and the discussion surrounding it:Well, we have to start from somewhere. Right? So right now,this is our starting point. . . It’s current. People are talking aboutit . . . It’s a good place to start talking . . . but it can’t stay at that[trans-affirmative policy level] . . . It can’t just remain a discussionof private enclosed places like the washroom . . . because ithappens all the time that you get a topic that gets a lot of buzzand then poof, it’s gone.Grace affirmed that though the policy has surfaced during a“trans moment” (Nicolazzo, 2017b) with respect to transgenderrights, it is crucial that the conversation regarding the importanceof trans accommodation within schools is not seen as fulfilledsimply because policy has created a space for discussing trans-affirmative engagement. As Kumashiro (2004) asserts:. . . challenging oppression requires more than simplybecoming aware of oppression, and this is because people areoften invested in the status quo, as when people desire repeatingFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 2722Omercajic and Martino Supporting Transgender Inclusion in Schoolswhat has become normalized in our lives. Change requires awillingness to step outside of this comfort zone (p. 46).Therefore, policy itself is a necessary political intervention, butas Grace points out, it is rendered ineffective unless educatorscan address their own subconscious desires for learning andteaching within a gender binary and cisgenderist framework(Frohard-Dourlent, 2016; Smith and Payne, 2016; Morgan andTaylor, 2018). As Rands (2009) argues, a more gender-complexapproach to education involves critically interrogating the genderoppression matrix as a basis for fostering professionally informedthreshold knowledges about gender diversity. Thus, addressinggender democratization in the space of schools needs to beunderstood in terms of not just the official articulation oftrans-affirmative policy discourse that relies on elaborating thespecifics of accommodation, but of a concerted and long-term commitment on behalf of administrators and educators tointerrogating institutionalized gender hierarchies and addressingcisgenderism (Connell, 2009; Nicolazzo, 2017c). By positioningaccommodation requests as a resolution to trans marginalizationin the education system, these policies tend to downplay theimplications of requiring transgender students to surrenderthemselves to a process of investigation in order to receivepermission to exist within a cisnormative system whilst refusingto restructure it. Moreover, it ignores Spade’s (2015) cautioningto avoid such top-down approaches that do little to address moreexpansive equity issues.Michael, for example, noted that Health and PhysicalEducation is an important curriculum site where educators arerequired to officially address gender diversity at both the schoolboard and Ministry of Education level (Ontario Ministry ofEducation, 2015):. . . the Health and Phys-Ed curriculum that was just recentlyreleased [. . . ] is the only curricular expectations that speakspecifically to gender identity and trans population. There areno other curricular expectations that lay that out specifically. So,how that looks in terms of how it’s taken up in schools becauseit’s still vague and wide enough to drive a truck through theway expectations are set up, again there’s no P.D. that’s beenattached to it, no money that’s been attached, so we’ll see howthat’s embraced by Health and Phys-Ed teachers everywhere.Addressing gender diversity with respect to physical educationis important given the fact that this is an area where studentsare already interacting with themes of the body and imposedgender roles (Green, 2010). Michael’s point, however, is thatthere are no allocated resources for professional developmentfor teachers, and hence a lack of commitment on behalf of theschool board despite its policy endorsement for supporting transand gender diverse youth in schools. Moreover, he confirms thatthere are no specific curricular stipulations outside of the healthand physical education curriculum, which is a fraught space,especially given the recent conservative government’s regressiveamendments to the 2015 version, which significantly delayedwhat grade educators are able to address gender and sexualdiversity (Ferguson and Rushowy, 2019). Such contingenciesfurther highlight the need for an officially sanctioned policy andcurriculum framework as a support for teachers in schools withregards to addressing transgender and gender diversity on “bothsystematic and incidental levels” throughout the curriculum(Green, 2010, p. 6).Michael, however, indicated that he has not witnessedany effort to employ a trans-inclusive curriculum by schooladministrators. Rather, he pointed out that the onus is oneducators to create an accepting and safe learning environmentthat is encouraged in the trans-specific policy. In fact, Michael feltthat steering a school to create an accepting learning environmentwith respect to embracing gender diverse expression in theclassroom does not necessarily equate with developing a trans-informed curriculum:I personally don’t see that there’s been any drive by theministry to embed gender diversity education in the curriculumany more than it already is. There’s kind of an emphasis inthe Education Act that you’re responsible for doing it, andit’s something that’s supposed to be done under the AcceptingSchools Act that is sort of a daily. . . making sure that you’rebeing inclusive, and respectful and all that sort of stuff. [. . . ]But I understand the nature of gender identity is not a learningoutcome. [Laughs] In the curriculum, do I think that’s going tohappen anytime soon? I don’t.Despite the emphasis in the Education Act3 and the AcceptingSchools Act4 2012, evidence suggests that teachers are noteffectively trained or provided with sustained professionaldevelopment which explicitly addresses gender identity andgender complexity, and that this lack of training and theabsence of trans-inclusive curriculum impact on enhancingunderstanding of trans inclusivity and livability in the schoolsystem (Luecke, 2011; Payne and Smith, 2014; Frohard-Dourlent,2016; Smith and Payne, 2016; Goodrich and Barnard, 2018;Leonardi and Staley, 2018). Importantly, the presence of a trans-inclusive curriculum is significant given that in schools whichhad a curriculum that was LGBTQ-inclusive, students wereless likely to hear negative remarks about transgender people(Kosciw et al., 2018, p. 70). Moreover, Michael exposes thelimits of the policy in its failure to address resource allocationand accountability measures for supporting trans-affirmativecurricular and professional development for principals andteachers in schools.Grace also underscored this sentiment that teachersundoubtedly require further education: “Anybody whoworks in the school should have some sort of sensitivitytraining. We all do the workplace safety training.” Whenprompted about developing this understanding and educationfor teachers with respect to what form it would take, and whowould run such a program, Grace answered simply: “P.D. Day[Professional Development Day]! We do everything online forWSIB [Workplace Safety and Insurance Board], stuff like that.I think it’s possible to put together modules that you have to3The Education Act was amended in 2012 by Bill 13 to formally mandate thepromotion of awareness, safety, and inclusion of transgender students in schoolsin order to prevent transphobia.4The Accepting Schools Act requires schools to prevent and address inappropriateand disrespectful behaviour among students in schools. It requires schools to havepolicies in place that address bullying and ensure inclusive education. The passageof the act controversially allowed for the creation of Gay Straight Alliances withoutbeing vetoed or disallowed in public schools in Ontario.Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 8 April 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 2723Omercajic and Martino Supporting Transgender Inclusion in Schoolscomplete in order to stay employed. That’s already been done.It’s not a far stretch. Um. [Pause]. I mean, training will onlydo so much, but. . . ” However, Green (2010) insists that theseprofessional development days need to provide productivespaces for teachers to unpack understandings about genderdiversity before they can adequately expect their students todo the same. Bryan (2012), for example, found that “teachersare quite blunt about the degree to which they already feelunsettled and unprepared when it comes to teaching aboutgender and sexual diversity” (p. 133) (Payne and Smith, 2014;Ullman, 2015; see also Leonardi and Staley, 2018). Therefore, itis clear that some teachers are willing to combat their feelingsof unpreparedness by educating themselves on gender diversityin order to create an inclusive classroom environment for theirstudents. However, Smith and Payne (2016) found that afterattending trans-informed professional development, manyteachers “resisted gender-affirming pedagogy and fixated on thelogistics of accommodating transgender students and keepingthem safe” (p. 34), which speaks to the logics at the heart of theschool board policies that are the subject of this article.Nevertheless, Michael stressed that the responsibility forensuring respect for diversity rests with the school’s codeof conduct. He added that while the latter is important,without proper education for teachers regarding issues of gendersensitivity and the need for a pedagogical commitment toaddressing gender diversity and trans inclusivity more broadly,students have a difficult time understanding the extent to whichcompulsory heterogenderism5 and cisgender systems actuallyoperate to deny trans recognizability and livability in the schoolsystem (Wyss, 2004; Taylor et al., 2011):[The code of conduct] is supposed to inform students abouthow they should be behaving, and when they don’t behavethat way, they get punished. So, we’ve really set up the systemterribly in the sense that staff who are expected to give themessage haven’t been properly trained. There’s no focus on whatthat training should look like for staff in a regular curriculumday. There’s no emphasis of the priority for that within thecurriculum itself. And students who need the information to beable to understand how to create a respectful environment don’tnecessarily get it from the staff—because they haven’t receivedthe training—get punished when they don’t behave that way.Michael suggests that simply writing the expectation of respectinto the code of conduct is insufficient, and he points to thelimits of a liberal focus on diversity as a basis for educating abouttrans inclusivity and addressing the specific needs of genderminority students (Gressgård, 2010; Martino and Cumming-Potvin, 2015). Rather, what is required, he argues, is a focuson why this respect is essential in terms of ensuring genderdemocratization and gender expansive understandings in theeducation system (Pyne, 2014; Martino and Cumming-Potvin,2018). Moreover, such an assertion highlights the significance ofembracing a model of trickle up social justice that shifts the focus5Nicolazzo (2017c) defines compulsory heterogenderism as “a cultural conditionby which diverse gender identities are positioned as abject or culturallyunintelligible” which contributes to their erasure and “makes one’s gender identityincomprehensible, unknowable, and invalid” (p. 247).away from merely accommodating individual students to onethat embraces a systemic consideration of trans marginalizationin the education system with its attention to creating self-determining spaces for trans and non-binary students to berecognized and affirmed (Spade, 2015; Frohard-Dourlent, 2018).Specifically, addressing the concerns of one student at a timedoes little to restructure a problematic cisgenderist system. Ourpolicy critique in fact highlights that there needs to be a movebeyond such reactive approaches to the presence of trans studentsin schools to encourage a broader focus on gender diversityas a necessary basis for addressing trans affirmative education(see also Frohard-Dourlent, 2018). This critical insight has vitalimplications for policy formulation and frames with respect tomoving beyond an individualistic focus on accommodating thetans student. For example, research by Taylor et al. (2011) inCanada and Kosciw et al. (2018) in the United States foundthat trans students felt more comfortable and a greater senseof belonging in schools with specific LGBTQ inclusive policiesand curriculum (p. 79). Our policy analysis is informed by suchempirical insights and, hence, speaks to our critique of policyframes that eschew a much-needed focus on trans informedcurriculum development and pedagogical intervention. Such aredirected focus highlights the need for more systemic educationabout gender diversity as opposed to more a reactive approachto relying merely on the presence of a trans student as basisfor instigating gender diversity education. In fact, while Meyeret al.’s (2016) research with teachers revealed that the presence ofa trans or gender-creative student was instrumental in initiatingintervention and support measures with respect to addressingtrans inclusion, they are critical of what they refer to as “apedagogy of exposure” where the individual trans student risksbecoming the “sacrificial lamb” for instigating more systemicpolicy enactment and curricular intervention designed to addressand educate about gender diversity (p. 17). This does not meanthat trans and non-binary students should not be at the centerof trans affirmative policy articulation and enactment in schools.In fact, it is vital that trans-informed policies prioritize “buildingleadership and membership on a “most vulnerable first” basis,centering the belief that social justice trickles up, not down andthat meaningful change comes from below” (Spade, 2015, p. 137).However, intervention and gender justice education which istaken solely in response to the presence of the trans student or bytrans students themselves advocating for themselves and for sucheducation constitutes a fundamental abnegation of responsibilityon behalf of the education system to ensure the safety, privacyand well-being of gender diverse youth. Through an approachwhich entails school boards and schools actively supportingand taking responsibility for gender complex education (Rands,2009), constructive steps toward gender democratization whichentails a “shift [in] focus from the individual rights framingof discrimination . . . . [to] think[ing] more broadly about howgender categories are enforced on all people in ways thathave particularly dangerous outcomes for trans people” can beactualized (Spade, 2015, p. 9).In order to move toward gender democratization, participantsappeared to advocate for what Rands (2009) refers to as agender-complex approach to education which entailed raisingFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 2724Omercajic and Martino Supporting Transgender Inclusion in Schoolsawareness about regimes of compulsory heterogendersim andcisnormativity with their occlusion of trans and othering of non-binary subjectivities (Ehrenhalt, 2016; Worthen, 2016; Nicolazzo,2017c) All three participants underscored the importanceof developing a trans-affirmative curriculum which movedbeyond merely accommodating trans students. However, theyindicated that they were not aware of systematic professionaldevelopment devoted to addressing gender identity and trans-inclusive education despite the School Board A’s policy supportfor such initiatives, thereby foregrounding the lack of any realcommitment to resource allocation to achieve these ends.The Limits of AccommodationThe participants agreed that despite each school board policy’semphasis on accommodation, they did not appear to translateinto fostering a safe space for trans students. Grace, for example,insisted “that the real weakness is the accommodation basedon request” aspect of their school board policy. When asked toelaborate on why they perceived this to be the case, their answerechoed those of the other participants:I think that it creates a bit of a problem in that a student—anybody—might know that you don’t fit female, but they don’treally know if they want to fit into male. So, having that binarythere established and saying, “Well, you have to fit into oneof these and if you don’t, you have to out yourself ” when youmight not even know what that means yet. Right? So, knowingthat you’re not the same as a binary isn’t the same as knowingdefinitively, “I identify as trans.” “I identify as queer.”Having students feel that they must out themselves in orderto be accommodated has the potential to increase surveillanceof trans and non-binary bodies and, hence, enhances the veryrisk of being victimized (Ingrey, 2018). Moreover, by placingthe onus on students to request their required accommodation,presumes that students who are, as Grace suggests, non-binary,understand what kind of accommodation(s) they require. In thisrespect, policies and schools need to envision a “transgenderimaginary” which “encapsulates more dynamic possibilitiesin the realization of gendered personhood” (Martino, 2016,p. 383). This is a significant approach that is “groundednecessarily in the voices and embodied experiences of transsubjects themselves,” and must be understood in response towhat Namaste (2000) documents as “the epistemic violencethat has contributed to the institutional and cultural erasureof the lived and bodily ontological existence of transgenderpeople in the everyday world” (p. 382). Policies must offer amore nuanced consideration of the spectrum of embodimentand how reactionary accommodation based upon request isnot as straightforward for all transgender and gender diverseindividuals but also need to commit to resource allocation tofoster more gender expansive education in schools.This notion of requiring a student to out themselves basedupon their gender identity and their need for accommodation isparadoxical to the very creation of the policies themselves, as bothpolicies cite the Taylor et al. (2011) report that documented thealarming statistics of trans student victimization occurring withinschools. Grace, for instance, linked the limits of accommodationto this potential for increased victimization and marginalization:It [the policy] asks people to out themselves and markthemselves as different, which then puts them at a higher riskof being victimized. [. . . ] I think that different people mightfind different solutions. . . . I would hope that there’s somebodythey can talk to and. . . “Based on request”—I don’t know if itsays it in here if it has to be the actual student who makes therequest. Because having a friend ask would be a solution as well.I don’t know if it would be possible to anonymously ask ormake a request. But it is a barrier in, you know, receiving theaccommodations that are promised in this.By placing the onus on the students to not only out themselvesbut also claim their own transgender identity and the subsequentrequired accommodations, these policies continue to enforcecisgender privilege in schools. While still maintaining thedominant gender binary, the policies create an “other” gendercategory, in which a student must situate themselves if theyare not cisgender. The creation of an “other” gender category,as Namaste (2000) further explains, “allows for a transgenderidentification but also denies a simultaneous identification withthe gender of ‘man’ or ‘woman’, while collapsing the differentways of identifying as transgendered and living one’s life” (p. 44).This system of having trans or gender diverse students declaretheir embodied differences reinforces the gender oppressionmatrix of which Rands (2009) speaks, which fails to “takeinto consideration those who do not identity within the binarygender categorization of men/boys and women/girls” (p. 423).As a result, while transgender students are not absolutelystripped of the right to use a bathroom that corresponds withtheir gender identity, they are denied the right of enteringwhichever bathroom they feel comfortable by having to requestto be accommodated.An emphasis on accommodation based upon individualrequest invokes no substantive change to the cisnormativesystem. As Dean explains: “I was away for 2 years, right? And so,you’d think if things had shifted [due to the policy], I would havenoticed a difference. And I don’t notice much of a difference.”The polemic of relying on singular accommodations as opposedto invoked more sweeping proactive systemic interventions doeslittle to interrogate or dismantle the cisnormative system, butinstead requires individual students to submit to interrogation.In this respect, schools must heed Greytak et al.’s (2009) andTaylor et al.’s (2011) invitation to become proactive in addressingsystemic issues by actively promoting and suffusing trans-affirmative resources, curriculum, and pedagogy within schoolswhich ensure “the climate is significantly more positive for sexualand gender minority students” (Taylor et al., 2011, p. 28).One of the unintended effects of the “accommodation basedupon request” invoked by these policies is that proactiveinterventions may not be undertaken until they are soughtout by trans students themselves. Mathers (2017), for example,highlights the problem of the cisnormative dynamics at playin how binary understandings of gender are mobilized to“make sense of transgender experience while placing an unequalemotional burden on transgender and gender non-conformingpeople to mend the interactional disruption of the gender panic”(p. 295). This polemic of relying on a policy discourse ofaccommodation at the expense of an emphasis on the necessity ofFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 2725Omercajic and Martino Supporting Transgender Inclusion in Schoolscreating and resourcing the pedagogical conditions for educatingabout gender diversity highlights the ethical, epistemic andpolitical considerations at play in addressing the articulation oftrans-affirmative policies in the education system (Journell, 2017;Mangin, 2018).CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONSIn this article our focus has been on generating criticalinsights into the development of trans-affirmative policies andpractices in specific school boards/school contexts, given thedearth of research that exists on this topic (Jones et al., 2016;Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017; Neary, 2018; Martino andCumming-Potvin, 2019). Our case study enabled us to providesome particularity and context specificity about the formulationof trans inclusive policies in the Ontario context, with theobjective of generating knowledge about the limitations of relyingon a discourse of accommodation as a basis for supportingtransgender and gender diverse students in the education system.Indeed, our research has highlighted that there is a continuedneed for educators and administrators to pay close attention toethical and political questions of trans livability in educationand school systems as part of an overall project of fosteringgender justice and gender democratization for all students(Rands, 2009; Pyne, 2014). It has also foregrounded the necessityof trans-affirmative policy that is committed to addressingtrans marginalization with respect to the provision of in-service and pre-service education to ensure that requisite teacherthreshold knowledges about gender diversity and cisgenderismcan be enacted beyond merely appealing to a fundamentimperative of accommodation (Rands, 2009; Luecke, 2018). AsMichael—equity officer with one of the school boards wherewe conducted our research—pointed out, resources are neededto support schools and teachers in this endeavor and politicalproject of enacting gender democratization. This particularschool board has a team of educators and social workerswho are equipped with knowledge and expertise and who aresought out by schools to support administrators, educators andstudents in terms of enacting the policy with respect to itsstipulations for accommodating trans students and addressingcomplex education. In this respect, there is some provisionof trans-informed professional development and support forschools. However, there is a necessity for policymakers toexplicitly address resource allocation and accountability moresystematically. Moreover, such support and education mustextend beyond merely fulfilling the accommodation terms of thepolicy, which requires and holds the board legally responsiblefor a failure to “respond to a transgender student’s concerns orrequest” (Ludeke, 2009, p. 16).Finally, in addition to staff and administrators requiringa deeper understanding of trans marginalization, this studyhas actively troubled the requirement bestowed upon transand gender diverse students to request accommodation. It isimportant that schools deeply consider the necessity of studentssafely accessing these gender-segregated areas without having torequest to do so. Putting the onus on the individual trans studentin this respect translates into a fundamental abnegation of theeducation system’s responsibility to actively address the broadercisgenderist forces at play and their institutionalization in schoolswhich make it difficult not only for trans youth to navigate thesystem on daily basis, but to feel comfortable about being outand visible in the first place, a phenomenon which (Carlile andPaechter, 2018) refer to as “precarious invisibility” (p. 86) (seealso Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017; Ferfolja and Ullman, 2020).In this sense, trans-affirmative policy ultimately needs to engagein a sustained way with a critical trans politics that is committedto both “conceptualiz[ing] the conditions trans people face andmore directly strategiz[ing] change that impacts the well-being oftrans people” (Spade, 2015, p. 16).DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTThe datasets generated for this study are available on request tothe corresponding author.ETHICS STATEMENTThe studies involving human participants were reviewed andapproved by The Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE),on behalf of Western’s Research Ethics Boards (REB) atthe University of Western Ontario.

Given thiscurrent climate, and the legacy of Section 28, schools have rarely been easy workplacesfor LGBT teachers. For LGBT teachers, significant energy and vigilance is required thento navigate the heteronormative and cis-normative staffroom and classroom. There isevidence that LGBT teachers try to remain as invisible as possible in their schools soas to not draw attention to themselves (Lee, 2019a). Some avoid promotion to schoolleadership roles fearing that the status will necessitate greater personal scrutiny byschool stakeholders. Based on key attributes including, reading people, compassion,and commitment to the inclusion of others, making connections managing uncertainty,courage, and risk-taking, this perspective piece argues that some of the strategiesLGBT teachers deploy to manage the intersection of personal and professional identitiesin school equip them with an array of particular skills that are conducive to excellentschool leadership.Keywords: cis-normativity, school workplace, parents, heteronormativity, leadership, teachers, LGBTINTRODUCTIONThis article argues that the strategies deployed by LGBT teachers to manage the intersection oftheir personal and professional identities equips them with a distinct set of skills that are valuableto effective school leadership. It begins by reflecting on the sociological and political landscape forLGBT teachers before considering five key attributes that LGBT teachers may acquire through theirlived experience as an LGBT teacher. The article concludes by recognizing the value of specificleadership programmes that celebrate protected characteristics and stresses the importance foryoung people of diverse role models, committed teachers, and authentic school leaders.THE CURRENT LANDSCAPEThere are as many as 50,000 LGBT teachers in British schools, yet there are very few openly LGBTHeadteachers (Lee, 2019a). The Equality Act of 2010 has done much to safeguard LGBT teachersfrom workplace discrimination but it is well-documented that despite advances in equalitieslegislation at the macro level, many LGBT teachers do not yet feel adequately protected or safeenough to be out to all stakeholders in their school workplaces (Gray, 2010; Lee, 2019a).Schools remain woefully behind the majority of other workplaces when it comes to LGBTinclusion. This is because, since the advent of Ofsted and school league-tables, conservatism, andthe approval of heterosexual, and conservative parents is at the heart of what schools do. Teachersare compelled to reflect the communities their schools serve through the Teachers Standards(Department for Education, 2013) which require that “personal beliefs are not expressed in ways30Lee LGBT Teachers Make Exceptional Leaderswhich exploit pupils’ vulnerability” and that teachers “musthave proper and professional regard for the ethos, policies, andpractices of the school in which they teach (p. 11).”Schools remain entrenched in the biologically predeterminedpower-ridden categorisations of male and female (Gray, 2010).This is evident in all phases of compulsory education, from thetoys available in the reception class home corner through tohighly gendered expectations of school leavers at their prom(Robinson, 2002). Pupils are grouped or split for activitiesaccording to gender, and even amongst the staff, rigid binariesof male or female are evident from the way in which pupils areexpected to address them as Mr, Mrs, or Miss.Homophobia in schools is well-documented in UK Schools.Cocker et al. (2019) report that many LGBT families arecompelled to adopt to quite elaborate strategies to navigatehomophobic discourses in schools, and Carlile (2019) too positsthat work must be done within primary schools to acknowledgeand celebrate LGBT relationships.According to Piper and Sikes (2010), when teachers strayinto territories in which sexual and gender norms are exploredor questioned, this has the potential to create moral panic.When heteronormativity is threatened then so too are thediscourses of power in the school (Gray, 2010; Rudoe, 2010) andinterventions usually follow. Section 28 of the Local GovernmentAct (1988–2003) was one such state sanctioned interventionwhen local authorities (to which state schools at that timebelonged) were forbidden from “the teaching in any maintainedschool of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended familyrelationship.” For 15 years, Section 28 created a climate in schoolsin which LGBT teachers feared they would lose their jobs shouldtheir LGBT identity be revealed in the school workplace. Worsestill, for 15 years, young people were denied support for issuesrelated to their sexual or gender identity, and children withsame-sex parents were denied access to resources which featuredfamilies like theirs.Despite the repeal of Section 28, the introduction of theEquality Act (2010) and the Equal Marriage Act (2015) therehave in 2019, been school gate parental and faith group protestsin Birmingham about the introduction of a new programmeof Relationships, Sex, and Health Education that is inclusiveof LGBT relationships. Anderton Park School was forced to goto the High Court seeking an injunction creating an exclusionzone around the school to prevent further protests, such wasthe devastating effect on pupils and staff. At nearby ParkfieldSchool, the Assistant Headteacher, Andrew Moffatt receiveddeath threats for implementing resources that depicted LGBTcharacters. This raised anxiety for LGBT teachers with manyequating the school gate protests with the hostilities of the Section28 era.Though rarely explicitly articulated, there is evidence thatthe principal fear of LGBT teachers is that the heteronormativeschool community will align their identity with discoursesof hypersexuality and pedophilia [see Cavanagh (2008),Borg (2015), Thompson-Lee (2017)]. Piper and Sikes (2010)too observe that “fear of the pedophile taints adult–childrelationships in general” (p. 567). Although Lee (2019b) suggestsall teachers are potentially under suspicion, Piper and Sikes arguethat “When the focus is on sex that is regarded as being outsideof the norm the difficulties are magnified” (p. 567). As the titleof the 2010 article by Piper and Sikes declares, “All Teachers areVulnerable but Especially Gay Teachers” (p. 566).It is not surprising then that LGBT teachers frequently reportthat significant energy, on top of an already demanding role,is needed to compartmentalize their personal and professionalselves, vigilantly, and tentatively navigating the complexitiesof their heteronormative school communities and trying toremain as invisible as possible (Ferfolja, 2007). Invisibility in theschool workplace is of course not conducive to job promotion(Rudoe, 2010) and many LGBT teachers avoid school leadershiproles altogether. Leadership is inevitably accompanied by greatervisibility in the school community and greater scrutiny andinterest from school stakeholders, and for some LGBT teacherssuch intrusion is not worth the reward of a leadership role.It can be argued however that the strategies LGBTteachers learn to deploy to navigate the complexities of theheteronormative and cisnormative school workplace equips themwith a set of skills that are conducive to an exceptional anddistinctly effective style of school leadership.THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKIt is important to stress that this article rejects essentialistdelineations of gender and sexuality recognizing that theyperpetuate heteronormativity. In common with Butler (1990),this article recognizes that behaviors associated with genderand sexuality are “instruments of regulatory regimes” and “thenormalizing categories of oppressive structures” (p. 13–14).When applied here, this article assumes that the oppressivestructures of heteronormativity mean that some LGBT teachersexperience the school workplace differently to their heterosexualand cis gendered colleagues. The behaviors needed to navigate theheteronormative school environment, when practiced over timeequip LGBT teachers with particular abilities which give them adistinct set of skills and attributes.LEADERSHIP ATTRIBUTESThere are five key leadership attributes that LGBT teachers mayhave in abundance. They are:• Reading people• Compassion and commitment to the inclusion of others• Making connections• Managing uncertainty• Courage and risk-taking.READING PEOPLEIt is widely recognized that reading people is necessary for LGBTpeople to successfully negotiate heteronormative environments(Mîndru and Nǎstasǎ, 2017). Reading people is defined by DeMelo et al. (2014) as “the ability to infer others” beliefs, desires,and intentions from their facial expressions (p. 1). They addFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 5031Lee LGBT Teachers Make Exceptional Leadersthat reading people is “important in interdependent decisionmaking. . . about the others’ intention to cooperate.”(p. 1).LGBT people often develop highly developed instincts aboutthe intentions of other people. Knight et al. (2014) show thatgay men and lesbians tend to be disproportionately representedin occupations that require high levels social perceptiveness.This perception is practiced over time and often deployed atgreat speed to protect LGBT people from exposure to prejudice.Through extensive practice, LGBT teachers often need to becomeadept at reading people and situations, and horizon scanningto determine whether or not it is safe to be out. Every timean LGBT teacher enters a new environment, meets a newcolleague or parent, they must be able to recognize the subtlestof dispositions and behaviors in others before judging whetheror not where relevant, it is safe to acknowledge their sexual orgender identity, or whether it would be safer instead to espousea neutral position or even to adopt a position of pseudo-cisgendered heterosexuality. When applied to leadership, beingadept at reading people is a highly effective attribute. Snyder(2006) identified that LGBT leaders often develop excellentemotional intelligence becoming adept at reading people andsituations. LGBT leaders who hone the skill of reading peopleare ideally placed to make good decisions when recruiting newemployees (Snyder, 2006). They may also become astute anddiscerning when interacting with a wealth of different schoolstakeholders, especially heterosexual parents with traditionalviews on sexual and gender identity. This may include knowinghow to engage difficult parents to diffuse an antagonistic situationand instinctively making good decisions on what informationto share and what to withhold in the best interests of theschool community.COMPASSION AND COMMITMENT TOTHE INCLUSION OF OTHERSAlthough the Equality Act (2010) protects UK LGBT teachersfrom overt discrimination, equality does not necessarily ensureinclusion. Exclusion can be subtle, divisive, and oft timesunintentional. LGBT teachers report extensive experience offeeling marginalized (Lee, 2019b). This may be in schoolstaffrooms, within their wider community, through their familiesof origin and often within their own experiences as a pupilat school (Ryan et al., 2009). Having experienced exclusionand marginalization, LGBT teachers often have empathy inabundance and are more likely to be highly sensitized to inclusivebest practice in their classrooms and amid teacher colleagues.Shallenberger (1994) asserted that the adversity endured throughbeing othered by society, enabled gay men to develop an arrayof particular skills, valuable to leadership including sensitivity todiverse employees and an understanding of oppression. Brooksand Edwards (2009) observe that LGBT workers have threeprimary needs which are inclusion, safety, and equity. LGBTteachers are likely to have a heightened awareness of thoseon the margins of their school community and seek ways toensure they feel included. When applied to leadership, LGBTteachers with personal experience of exclusion are likely to havedeveloped a strong sense of social justice and an abundanceof empathy with pupils, parents, and colleagues who may bemarginalized on the basis of race, faith or social class, and otherprotected characteristics.MAKING CONNECTIONSThis article has described the interminable heteronormativityand cis-normativity that stubbornly prevails in UK schoolcommunities. Within these conservative school workplacesLGBT teachers become skilful in identifying ways in which theycan connect with others with whom they may not naturallyhave much in common. Alternative genders and sexualitiesare silenced in school communities to such an extent that therevelation of a same-sex partner is seen as belonging in therealm of the private and intimate, in the way that an oppositesex partner is not (Lee, 2019b). Fingerhut (2011) found thatdeveloping kinship and building alliances between LGBT andheterosexual allies is key to disrupting heteronormative spaces.LGBT teachers may then use the sharing of information deemedintimate to their advantage. By revealing their gender or sexualidentity, they enter into subtle transactional discourses withcis and heterosexual colleagues, who often share informationthat belongs in the private realm in return (Hunter, 2007).The intimate sharing of personal information is invaluable forschool leaders when building trust with different stakeholdersacross the school community. LGBT teachers are practiced atfinding common ground with a diverse range of colleagues andstakeholders, and where LGBT school leaders are able to comeout to colleagues, they report closer working relationships andgreater levels of trust from their colleagues Studies by Bowring(2017), Jennings (2005), Leithwood and McAdie (2007), allconcluded that LGBT educators being out contributed to a betterenvironment for themselves, their colleagues, and their students.Being open about sexual identity fulfills a basic need to confirmand affirm one’s identity. Disclosure allows individuals to form anauthentic and stable sense of self (Rose Ragins, 2004), and reducesthe cognitive dissonance and burden of identity managementwithin the school workplace (King et al., 2008). LGBT teacherswho enter into a “Don’t ask, Don’t tell” relationship with theirschool communities often feel that their personal identities arebeing silenced (Thompson-Lee, 2017).MANAGING UNCERTAINTYAs this article has already posited, LGBT teachers are adeptat tolerating a good deal of ambiguity and learn to functioneffectively when a great deal is uncertain. LGBT teachers oftendo not know for sure who knows about their gender or sexualidentity. Space for declarative statements is often hard to find(Rasmussen, 2004) and rumor is usually commonplace in schoolcommunities. LGBT teachers present themselves to a host ofdifferent stakeholders in a variety of different contexts. Thiscan be especially acute in rural school communities wherethere can be a blurring of the personal and professional (Lee,2019a). Teacher colleagues are likely to be parents of childrenFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 5032Lee LGBT Teachers Make Exceptional Leadersat the school and parents may be predominant membersof the rural community known to the LGBT teacher in adifferent context (Thompson-Lee, 2017). Even when LGBTteachers are out to the entire school community they cannotbe sure whether school stakeholders approve or privately holdhomophobic beliefs and values (Khayatt, 1999). Amongst allthis uncertainty, LGBT teachers learn to adopt a business asusual attitude, performing effectively and without distractionwhilst inwardly oftenmanaging a considerable degree of personalturmoil, something Meyer (2003) identifies as minority stress.Most recently however, Meyer (2015) has observed that LGBTpeople can mount effective coping responses and most surviveand even thrive despite minority stress. This is an exceptionalskill for school leadership. School leaders often must protecttheir school communities from uncertainty, adversity, or badnews whilst exuding confidence, calm, and a sense of being incontrol. According to Hansen (2011) a crisis is always the truetest of leadership. He states that whilst it is easy to lead wellwhen things are going well, it is far more difficult when thingsare going poorly. LGBT teachers have extensive experience ofoperating under great personal stress whilst betraying nothing intheir professional demeanor. This makes them ideally placed toprovide composed leadership that reassures school stakeholdersand builds trust in their leadership.COURAGE AND RISK-TAKINGFinally, courage and risk-taking are vital facets of schoolleadership and LGBT teachers often develop these in abundance.According to Snyder (2006), the gay leaders in his study werecomfortable in risk taking, and using their non-conformity,became creative problem solvers because of their experience ofhaving to create their own life paths in a heterosexist society. Eachtime LGBT teachers apply for a new position they must calculatewhether or not their new school workplace will afford them thespace to speak their authentic selves into existence, or whetherinstead they will be corralled into an all too common “Don’tAsk, Don’t Tell” (DePalma and Atkinson, 2009) arrangementwith colleagues and line-managers. It is an act of considerablecourage for an LGBT teacher to present themselves authenticallywithin a new school workplace. Those commencing their careersduring the Section 28 era know all too well that schools oftenprovide no space for LGBT teachers to speak their identityinto existence (Nixon and Givens, 2007). Creating such a spaceis an act of considerable courage and involves great personalrisk to and may jeopardize future career prosperity (Rasmussen,2004). The LGBT leaders in Shallenberger (1994) study, perceivedthemselves as more valuable to their employer because of theircourage and willingness to take risks. Courage and calculatedrisk-taking is important in school leadership and LGBT teachersthrough years of risk-taking and acts of courage often builda heightened intuition that guides them in taking appropriaterisks and demonstrating courage in the best interests of theirschool communities.Few would disagree that in order to flourish educationally,young people need access to diverse role models, committedteachers, and authentic school leaders (Lee, 2019a). WhenLGBT leaders become visible within their school communities,they embody a distinct and exceptional type of leadership(Fassinger et al., 2010) through the acquisition and applicationof the five attributes identified in this article. When LGBTteachers become school leaders, they trouble institutionalheteronormative and heterosexist practices (Gray, 2013)and via their own visibility, give other school stakeholderssuch as children and young people, parents, and colleagues,permission to also participate authentically and withoutfear. At a time when the average length of service of aHeadteacher is just 3 years, it is crucial that investmentinto effective and distinct school leadership programmes(e.g., Courageous Leaders, LGBTEd, as well as Women Edand BAME Ed) continues, so that we attract, recruit, andkeep talented school leaders who reflect the full diversity ofBritish society.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe author confirms being the sole contributor of this work andhas approved it for publication.REFERENCESBorg, J.

Wewere concerned that this only presented a partial insight into the experiences of gayteachers. This study researched the personal and professional experiences of four gayteachers in England. It builds on existing research by presenting positive narratives ratherthan positioning gay teachers as victims. We use the term “chalkface” to illustrate that allwere practicing teachers. The purpose of the study was to explore their experiences asgay teachers throughout their careers. The study used the life history method to createnarratives of each participant. Semi-structured interviews were used. The study foundthat the repeal of Section 28 in England in 2003 did not have an immediate effect on theidentities, resilience, and agency of the participants. The 2010 Equality Act in Englandand changes to the school inspection framework had a greater influence in supportingtheir agency, resilience, and willingness to merge personal and professional identities. Allbut one participant managed to use their identities as gay teachers to advance inclusionand social justice through the curriculum. Although the narratives that we have presenteddo illuminate some negative experiences, the accounts are largely positive, in contrastwith existing literature which positions gay teachers as victims.Keywords: queer, teachers, gay, stories, narrativeINTRODUCTIONThis study explores the experiences of four gay educators who taught in schools during Section 28and following its repeal. We were interested in exploring the ways in which Section 28 impactedon the agency, resilience and identities of these teachers during the time that the legislationwas in force and following its repeal. Homosexuality was partially decriminalized in Englandand Wales in 1967. Despite this, the government of the United Kingdom introduced Section28 in 1988 which prevented schools from promoting homosexuality or its acceptability as a“pretended family relationship” (Local Government Act, 1988). Research demonstrates that thelegislation continued to impact and influence teachers’ practice and identities for many years afterits repeal in 2003 (Greenland and Nunney, 2008; Edwards et al., 2016). This study explores theparticipants’ experiences of teaching during and after the repeal of Section 28. It explores theinternational literature on the experiences of teachers who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, orqueer (LGBTQ+). It explores theoretical perspectives on stress, resilience, identity, and agency. Thecomplete narratives of the participants are presented because we wanted to privilege their stories.35Stones and Glazzard Narratives of Gay TeachersThe narratives are subsequently analyzed using the theoreticalframeworks that are outlined earlier in the paper.The Experiences of LGBTQ+ TeachersHomosexuality was decriminalized in England and Wales in1967. Prior to this, individuals engaging in homosexual acts faceda maximum sentence of life in prison. Despite decriminalization,official, and legal disapproval of homosexuality continued formany years with inequality remaining prevalent (Epstein, 2000;Nixon and Givens, 2007). Introduced by Margaret Thatcher’sConservative government in 1988, Section 28 (Local GovernmentAct, 1988) signaled this disapproval by seeking to impose uponlocal authorities and their schools a prescribed view which soughtto repress and restrict public debate of sexuality (Nixon andGivens, 2007). It has been argued that:Section 28 (part of the Local Government Act of 1988) was anotorious piece of legislation that sought to prevent local educationauthorities in the UK from ‘promoting homosexuality’. The effect ofSection 28 was to create uncertainty and fear among teachers as towhat was (and what was not) permitted in schools. (Greenland andNunney, 2008, p. 243)Recent research demonstrates the powerful and long-lastingcultural effect of Section 28 (Edwards et al., 2016). It contributedto a climate of fear through the normalization of heterosexuality,thus resulting in marginalization, oppression, and regulation ofthose with deviant sexual identities (Neary, 2013). It has beenemphasized that:Most research referring to [Section 28] has been highly critical,viewing it as symbolic discrimination that institutionalizesa hierarchical relationship between heterosexuality andhomosexuality, and it is held up as a prime example of theexclusion of lesbians and gay men from full cultural citizenship.(Burridge, 2004, p. 329)Teachers held several misconceptions about Section 28, especiallyin relation to what was legal and what was not, and thisuncertainty and confusion caused difficulties (Warwick et al.,2001). For example, teachers were often unable to drawdistinctions between promoting homosexuality and simplyproviding students with advice (Greenland and Nunney, 2008).In addition, many teachers were unsure about the legality ofdiscussing homosexuality, and this often led to an avoidance ofthe subject entirely (Buston and Hart, 2001). This meant thatschools avoided discussion of LGBTQ+ topics and any relatedcurricula (Epstein et al., 2003). Research also demonstratesthat Section 28 supported the growth of homophobic bullyingthrough creating school cultures which failed to challenge andaddress homophobia and homophobic harassment (Epstein,2000; Warwick et al., 2001).Section 28 prohibited schools from promoting homosexualityor its acceptability as a “pretended family relationship”(Local Government Act, 1988). This normalized heterosexualmarriage (Nixon and Givens, 2007) and sustained culturesof heteronormativity in schools, despite the partialdecriminalization of homosexuality over 20 years earlier.Thus, Section 28 reinforced the marginalization of people withLGBTQ+ identities. As demonstrated by Foucault (1978) andEllis (2007), homo sexuality has been historically associated withdisease and mental illness. Through condemning difference,Section 28 effectively positioned teachers with non-heterosexualidentities as patients and sufferers (Ellis, 2007) whose divergenceand difference left them feeling at risk and in need of help(Quinlivan, 2002).Section 28 was repealed in England and Wales in 2003.Research demonstrates that the act continued to impact andinfluence teachers’ practice for many years after its repeal(Greenland and Nunney, 2008; Edwards et al., 2016). Researchershave also argued that this repeal was a superficial change inlegislation which only went a small way in challenging the deepheterosexist discourse and gross inequality already embeddedin schools (Nixon and Givens, 2007). In part, this researchstudy will explore the effect of Section 28 on teacher agency,resilience and identity and whether this has changed since itsrepeal in 2003.Some research has demonstrated the harassment anddiscrimination of teachers with LGBTQ+ identities (Cooper,2008; Neary, 2013). Dominant heteronormative discourses inschools often situate teachers with LGBTQ+ identities withinexclusionary spaces (Gray et al., 2016). Research has linked theseexperiences of bullying, violence, invisibility, and alienation withelevated risks of mental ill health, self-harm, and suicidality(Mayock et al., 2009; Bryan and Maycock, 2017). Eliason (2010)conceptualizes the “suicide consensus” (p. 7) that has emergedfrom over 30 years of research. This research compared theexperiences of individuals with LGBTQ+ identities with thoseof peers whose identities were normative (Bryan and Maycock,2017). LGBTQ+ teachers are required to negotiate complexpersonal and professional boundaries (Vicars, 2006; Gray, 2013)and decide whether or not to be visible and open about theirprivate truth (Grace and Benson, 2000). This isolation hasdeterred teachers from assuming positions as visible role modelsin schools (Russell, 2010; Gray et al., 2016). To conceal andreduce stigmatizing labels, individuals with LGBTQ+ identitieswill often pass off and cover up their sexuality in order to seekacceptance and equivalence. Through doing so, these teacherscan conform to the heteronormative and heterosexist discoursesthat prevail in schools (Gray et al., 2016; Reimers, 2017).According to Røthing (2008), teachers’ experiences areinfluenced by “homotolerant” (p. 258) school cultures. Althoughheteronormativity might be less overt than it was previously(Berry, 2018), it still exists in subtle forms (Gray et al., 2016).These include bias and microaggressions (Francis and Reygan,2016). Despite microaggressions originally emerging from race-based research (Lynn, 2002; Yosso, 2005), they have beenexplored in recent years in relation to sexual orientation andgender identity (Nadal et al., 2011; Francis and Reygan, 2016).Microaggressions therefore appear in a range of settings andcontexts and can be understood as:...brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioural, orenvironmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional,that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative slights andinsults towards members of oppressed groups. (Nadal, 2008, p. 23)Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 5236Stones and Glazzard Narratives of Gay TeachersResearch has demonstrated that the LGBTQ+ community,including staff and students in schools, is exposed tomicroagressions and subtle bias which perpetuate heterosexismand exclude those with LGBTQ+ identities (Walls, 2008;Nadal et al., 2011). Francis and Reygan’s (2016) researchhas summarized the microaggressions facing those in theLGBTQ+ community. These include: heterosexist language;heteronormative and gender normative discourses; exoticisingthe identities of LGBTQ+ individuals; outright disapprovalof those with LGBTQ+ identities; denying homophobia andpathologising those within the LGBTQ+ community. Minikel-Lacocque’s (2013) research also characterizes the contestedmicroaggressions which occur when aggressors deliberately andpurposefully deny their actions.Research demonstrates many of the factors contributing tothe oppression of teachers with LGBTQ+ identities, includingnegative comments from students, peers, colleagues, lack ofpromotion, being forced to conceal their personal identities andheteronormative discourses in schools (Vicars, 2006; DePalmaand Jennett, 2010; Piper and Sikes, 2010; Ferfolja and Hopkins,2013; Gray, 2013; Gray et al., 2016). In addition to this research,teachers with LGBTQ+ identities have also been viewed withsuspicion by parents and other adults (Rudoe, 2010) and recentsafeguarding discourses has meant that a teacher’s disclosure oftheir sexuality might be considered inappropriate (Gray et al.,2016).Although there is a paucity of literature available (Ferfolja andHopkins, 2013), research does demonstrate that the experiencesof LGBTQ+ students have improved in very recent yearswith more students now self-identifying as LGBTQ+ to resistbigotry and discrimination (Berry, 2018). Despite this, researchdemonstrating the positive accounts of teachers in Englandremains sparse. Reflecting on the scarcity of this research, itis also important to consider the advances in internationalLGBTQ+ inclusion.The International ContextHowever, despite more liberal attitudes in some contexts, it hasbeen argued that heterosexuality is embedded in the practicesof institutions and the encounters of our everyday life (Epsteinand Johnson, 1994). Although the rights of individuals withLGBTQ+ identities have been strengthened across Europe(Lundin, 2015), international research continues to demonstratethat heteronormative and heterosexist cultures are entrenchedwithin schools (Kjaran and Kristinsdóttir, 2015). There is alsoevidence that these normative values are inculcated withinschools in countries where homosexuality is legal, includingAustralia (Gray et al., 2016) and the United States (Lineback et al.,2016).Even in countries known for their liberal attitude towardsexuality, such as Sweden, heteronormative attitudes continue toprevail within schools (Lundin, 2015). Furthermore, in countrieswhere homosexuality is illegal or disapproved of, including someAsian and African countries, strict cultural values are used as a“yardstick” (Amoah and Gyasi, 2016, p. 1) to disregard the rightsof those with LGBTQ+ identities (Po-Han, 2016).Regardless of the legal status of homosexuality, religion, andculture shape public opinion on its acceptability (Adamczykand Pitt, 2009). Research demonstrates that teachers withLGBTQ+ identities from across the globe continue to experiencediscrimination and marginalization (King et al., 2008; Hardie,2012; Marris and Staton, 2016). Together, these factors restrictthe willingness and ability of teachers to declare their sexuality inprofessional settings (Wright and Smith, 2015). This study willreflect on this and research the lived experiences of LGBTQ+teachers in England.The recognition of same-sex relationships in the United Stateshas increased, though many individuals with LGBTQ+ identitiescontinue to face discrimination (Lineback et al., 2016). Despitethis societal tolerance, research has demonstrated that someschools in the US provide discriminatory environments forlesbian and gay individuals and that teaching is one of themost homophobic professions in parts of the US (DeLeon andBrunner, 2013; Lineback et al., 2016). According to DeLeonand Brunner (2013), attempts have even been made to excludeLGBTQ+ teachers from the profession to lessen the risksof sexual abuse, pedophilia, molestation, and the recruitmentof children into queer lifestyles (Jackson, 2007; Mayo, 2008;Lineback et al., 2016). Individuals with discriminatory viewshave accused LGBTQ+ teachers in the US of attempting toinfluence students’ identities and this illustrates the problematicand homophobic school cultures which some teachers in the USare exposed to Jackson (2007).Recent research by Reimers (2017) draws on data from aSwedish teacher training programme and demonstrates howsexuality norms produce spaces of heteronormativity in whichone body can be more vulnerable than another. According toReimers (2017), Sweden provides an environment for “queers”(p. 92) which is better than in many other places, althoughidentifying as LGBTQ+ is still seen as deviation. Therefore,it can be argued that whilst attitudes in Sweden are generallymore liberal toward sexuality, heteronormative discourses stilldominate their schools and the experiences of queer teacherswithin them. To address the vulnerabilities of those within theLGBTQ+ community, Reimers (2017) suggests investigatinghomonationalism. This involves intersecting LGBTQ+ rightswith a country’s democracy and ideology (Puar, 2013). Reimers(2017) therefore argues that homonationalism can be used as avehicle to advance an inclusive agenda within Swedish schoolsby favorably associating the country’s ideology with the rights ofthose within the LGBTQ+ community.To be LGBTQ+ and to work as a teacher is to occupya complex terrain and exist within a “space of exclusion”(Gray et al., 2016, p. 286). This draws on Vicars’ (2006)concept of “problematic terrain” (p. 351). Although stateschools in Australia protect those with LGBTQ+ identities,Gray et al. (2016) highlights that such protection is notoffered by independent and religious schools and that teacherswithin these schools are obliged to uphold any religiousethos. Ferfolja’s (2008) research demonstrates that within theAustralian Catholic schooling system, contractual obligationsand the threat of dismissal are used to silence those withLGBTQ+ identities.Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 5237Stones and Glazzard Narratives of Gay TeachersEven in countries where homosexuality is legal, teachers withLGBTQ+ identities are still likely to be victims of institutionalapathy and there is a disconnect between the recognition ofLGBTQ+ rights by societies and the recognition of these rightswithin education (Gray et al., 2016). Research also demonstratesthis disconnect in the healthcare sector with one in every eightof the 5,000 LGBTQ+ people surveyed reporting experiencesof unequal treatment from healthcare staff (Bachmann andGooch, 2017). There appears to be limited research presentingany correlation between the prejudice-based bullying inthese sectors.Minority StressMeyer (2003) Minority Stress model has been used bymainstream psychologists to explain how minority status canimpact on mental health outcomes for individuals who identifyas part of a minority group. It is a particularly useful modelfor understanding the experiences of LGBTQ+ teachers becauseit identifies the various stressors to which they might beexposed to.The model identifies different types of stress that minorityindividuals experience. Environmental circumstances such aspoverty can produce general stressors (for example, financialstress). General stressors could also include the loss ofa job, experiences of bereavement, or changes in familycircumstances, such as divorce (Meyer, 2003). Distal stressorsrelate to the experience of stigma, prejudice, discrimination,victimization, and bullying by others based on an individual’ssexual orientation or gender identity produces distal stressors(Meyer, 2003). These experiences can be shaped by structuralforces (for example, racism, heteronormativity/heterosexism)which result in structural disadvantage for minority groups.Proximal stressors relate to an individual’s perception orappraisal of situations. The expectation or anticipation thata person with a minority status may experience rejection,discrimination, victimization, or stigmatization based on one’sprevious experiences of this can result in self-vigilance andidentity concealment (Meyer, 2003). LGBTQ+ teachers mayanticipate negative reactions to their sexual orientation or genderidentity from students, parents, or colleagues. To reduce thelikelihood of negative experiences occurring, self-vigilance andconcealment are employed but these tactics can result in fearof discovery, psychological distress, internalized shame, guilt,anxiety, and social isolation. Internalized negativity is whereLGBTQ+ people internalize negativemessages from others abouttheir identities. It is a product of social prejudices. It can resultin feelings of shame and self-disgust and can lead to adversemental health outcomes (Herek et al., 1998; Herek, 2009). Thiscan affect an individual’s sense of self, resulting in detrimentalimpacts upon academic achievement, confidence, and socialconnectedness. Intersectional identities (for example, someonewho is LGBTQ+ and has a disability) can result in multiple formsof discrimination.Meyer (2003) identified social support systems as a vitalfactor in protecting minority groups from adverse mentalhealth. Individuals may therefore choose to participate in sexualminority communities to enable them to enter into a non-stigmatizing environment (Cohen, 2004; Shechner et al., 2010).LGBTQ+ teachers may choose to join an LGBTQ+ networkor they may form online social networks to gain support andpositive affirmation. More recently, Meyer (2015) has arguedthat community resilience is an aspect of the minority stressmodel. LGBTQ+ people might access the queer community tobenefit from community resilience.Meyer (2015) argues against afocus on resilience within individuals because it focuses attentionon the individual’s response to stress rather than the stressoritself, which is the social environment which the individualis exposed to. Research by Baams et al. (2015) found thatfeeling like a burden to significant others in their lives is acritical mechanism in explaining higher levels of depression andsuicidal ideation among LGB youth. They found that althoughgirls experience lower levels of stress in relation to coming outthan boys, they felt more of a burden to family and friendsand were therefore more likely to experience depression andsuicidal ideation.ResilienceIt is essential to consider the theme of resilience when exploringthe capacities of LGBTQ+ teachers to navigate personaland professional transitions. Evidence suggests that resilienceinfluences an individual’s ability to adapt to transitions (Jindal-Snape, 2016). We conceptualize resilience as a characteristicthat is not just individual but one that is relational. Wedraw on Greenfield’s (2015) model of teacher resilience whichexamines the impact of relationships, institutional cultures,challenges, and the broader policy context on the resilienceof teachers. This ecological framework of resilience is appliedto the data to understand the factors which influence theresilience of the participants. This will address the finalresearch question.Traditional perspectives on resilience have conceptualized itas a fixed trait within individuals (Masten and Garmezy, 1985).However, more recent perspectives conceptualize resilience asa dynamic attribute which is influenced by social, cultural,and political contexts (Luthar, 2006; Roffey, 2017). Althoughsome perspectives on resilience emphasize positive adaptationfollowing adversity or trauma (Gayton and Lovell, 2012) andthe capacity to grow in response to adversity (Stallman, 2011),these perspectives are not sufficient because they place emphasison the individual to overcome adversity rather than exploringthe systemic factors which directly influence a person’s resilience(Meyer, 2015). Traditional perspectives emphasize resilience asthe ability to rebound (McIntosh and Shaw, 2017), the abilityto problem solve and to return to the previous state (McIntoshand Shaw, 2017; Sanderson and Brewer, 2017). This ability topush through regardless of circumstances is a dominant themein the literature (Reyes et al., 2015) but these perspectivesonly offer a partial understanding of resilience because they donot acknowledge that resilience is relational and influenced bysocietal structures.Literature has started to present models of resilience whichidentify the interdependency between the individual and broadercontexts which intersect with their lives and the significanceFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 4 July 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 5238Stones and Glazzard Narratives of Gay Teachersof these contexts in shaping resilience (Hartley, 2011). Forexample, Jameson (2014) provides one of the few accounts ofresilience from a systemic perspective. In addition, Greenfield(2015) model of teacher resilience emphasizes the way in whichteachers are positioned within social and broader contexts whichimpact on their individual resilience. Although this frameworkwill be used as a conceptual lens within this study to analysethe factors which shape the resilience of the participants, themodel fails to identify the specific contexts which shape teachers’lives. Examples of these include political factors which restrictor support teacher agency and religious discourses which mayimpact on teacher resilience for teachers who are workingin schools with a strong religious affiliation or which servereligious communities. However, the model is useful in that itidentifies the individual, relational, and contextual factors whichcan serve as both risk and protective factors in relation to ateacher’s resilience. These include a sense of hope, purpose andself-efficacy (individual factors), relationships with family andfriends (relational factors), relationships with leaders and othercolleagues (contextual factors), the extent of the challenges whichteachers face and the broader policy context in which teachersoperate (Greenfield, 2015).AgencyIn analyzing the lived experiences of the participants, this studywill examine the extent to which their agency is restricted orotherwise by systemic factors and discourses which regulatetheir working lives. Evidence suggests that individuals withgreater agency experience smoother transitions (Bandura, 2000,2001). Although agency has been conceptualized as the abilityto take initiative (Jindal-Snape, 2016) and make choices, itis important to emphasize that agency is context-specific(Jindal-Snape, 2016) and also influenced by one’s self-efficacy(Bandura, 2000). The concept of teacher efficacy is particularlyrelevant to this study. Specifically, this study will draw onPantić’s (2015) model of teacher agency which identifies fourfactors that influence teacher agency. These include sense ofpurpose, competence, autonomy, and reflexivity to mediate orovercome barriers which restrict agency (Pantić, 2015). Themodel is useful because it positions teacher agency within thebroader socio-cultural contexts in which teachers operate andtherefore acknowledges the role of systemic factors in influencingteacher agency.IdentityLiterature suggests that LGBTQ+ teachers navigate theirpersonal and professional identities (Gray, 2013). Someparticipants may be in the process of coming to terms with theirgender identities or sexualities and will make decisions aboutwhether to separate or intertwine their personal and professionalidentities. Within the context of this study, identities will beviewed as multiple and exist within a state of flux rather thanbeing conceptualized as unified, coherent, and static. LGBTQ+teachers have personal and professional identities which canintertwine or collide. Research demonstrates that some choose tomaintain a distinction between their personal and professionalidentities and others mesh them together by using their personalidentities to advance LGBTQ+ inclusion in schools (Stones andGlazzard, 2019). In addition, some teachers may adopt Goffman’s(1963) techniques of “passing” (p. 73) or “covering” (p. 102) toconceal their non-normative identities.Seminal work on teacher identity has illustrated how theoccupational and personal selves become integrated to producea coherent self (Nias, 1989) whereas other work has highlightedthe tensions that exist between substantial and situational selves(Sikes et al., 1985; Woods and Jeffrey, 2002). However, morerecent work suggests that teacher identity is not a stable entity butcontinually reconstructed as a product of conflicting discoursesand practices (Sikes et al., 1985; Day et al., 2006). It is alwaysdeferred and in the process of becoming: “never really, never yet,never absolutely there” (MacLure, 2003, p. 131). Thus, identityformation is a continual process of negotiation and “a potentialsite of agency” (Clarke, 2009, p. 187).Research GapsExisting research has considered the experiences of LGBTQ+teachers. A synthesis of this literature highlights recurrentthemes including marginalization, bullying, harassment,discrimination, and isolation. There is research fromcountries where homosexuality is illegal or disapproved of,including some African and Asian countries (Amoah andGyasi, 2016; Po-Han, 2016), as well as in countries wherehomosexuality is legalized, such as Australia (Gray et al., 2016),the United States (Lineback et al., 2016) and throughout parts ofEurope (Lundin, 2015).Despite this international literature, there is a paucity ofresearch capturing the experiences of LGBTQ+ teachers andwho currently teach or have taught in schools in England.Much of the existing research positions those within theLGBTQ+ community as victims (Gray et al., 2016) who areexposed to suffering and violence (Devís-Devís et al., 2017)and there appears to be limited research presenting positiveaccounts despite the field of positive psychology which has grownsignificantly in recent years (Lytle et al., 2014; Pawelski, 2016).Research Aims and QuestionsThe broad aim of the research was to explore the experiences ofgay teachers who taught during and after Section 28 in England.We wanted to explore the ways in which the legislation impactedon them and whether their experiences changed following therepeal of the legislation in 2003.This research study addressed the followingresearch questions:• What have been (and currently are) the experiences ofLGBTQ+ teachers?• What factors affect their resilience?• How do they negotiate their personal andprofessional identities?Much of the existing literature positions queer teachers as victimswho lack agency and are forced to conceal their identities (Kinget al., 2008; Hardie, 2012; Marris and Staton, 2016) or maintaina separation between their personal and professional identitiesFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 5239Stones and Glazzard Narratives of Gay Teachers(Wright and Smith, 2015). This study sought to offer counter-narratives to the victimized narratives which are dominant in theexisting literature.METHODSThis research study explored the lived experiences of four gayteachers. We sought to capture the unique nature of people’sexperiences (Goodson, 1992; Goodson and Sikes, 2001) in aform that was both engaging and compelling. Within a narrativemethodology, we used the life history method to illuminate theunique and rich experiences of an individual’s life (Webster andMertova, 2007; Riessman, 2008). This method places informants’stories within the broader context of public issues and in doingso highlights the social and cultural discourses which intersectwith the lives of individuals. Each teacher participated in asemi-structured interview.ParticipantsParticipants were recruited to the study using our personalsocial media platforms. We were interested in representing thestories of queer teachers and we put out an open call to inviteparticipation. The criteria for inclusion were that the participantsneeded to identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans, that theymustbe practicing teachers and that they must have taught duringSection 28. Unfortunately, we did not secure participation fromteachers who identified as lesbian or bisexual or trans and werecognize that this is a methodological weakness of the study.We have reflected on our own positionality within the research(Berger, 2013). It is possible that our own status as two gay maleresearchers impacted on the diversity of the sample. None of theparticipants were known to us. The breakdown of participants isincluded in Table 1.ProceduresWe used semi-structured interviews in which we simply invitedeach participant to tell us about their experiences of being aqueer teacher. Interviews were conducted via video conferencingsoftware and audio recorded. We did not use a schedulebut decided to follow the lead of the participants’ (Alasuutariet al., 2008). Data were captured using digital recordings andtranscribed to create life narratives for analysis.The study gained ethical clearance from the university ethicalapprovals committee. Informed consent was gained prior tocollecting any data and participants were assured of their rightsto confidentiality and anonymity.As Laurel Richardson has pointed out, writing about andre-presenting lives carries a “moral responsibility” (Richardson,1990, p. 131) and consequently “it is not to be embarked onlightly” (Goodson and Sikes, 2001, p. 99). We were committedto using our “narrative privilege” (Adams, 2008) wisely by jointlyinterpreting data with participants and using member checksafter the accounts were constructed.Data AnalysisThematic analysis was used using an established framework(Braun and Clarke, 2006) to identify key themes arising fromacross the four narratives. Firstly, each narrative was analyzedindividually to identify emergent themes. A cross-sectionalanalysis was then carried out to identify common themesfrom across the narratives. The outcomes of the cross-sectionalanalysis are presented in Table 2.A table of themes arising from the analysis is presentedin Table 3.RESULTSThe following narratives were produced using the interviewtranscripts. The narratives have been developed from thetranscriptions and do not include all aspects of the transcriptions.TomSeptember 1990 had arrived. It had been mid-day on the first dayof a new school year and the high-pitched chime of the lunchtimebell had reverberated through the corridors.

I felt it might be an issue for staff and children, so I didn’t sayanything. My first school was in Leeds. I lived in Manchester, so it was easy to keep my personal and professional lives separate. I made aconscious decision to look for jobs on the other side of the Pennines (Jack).When I first started teaching in the 1990s the law hadn’t changed. I didn’t lie but I only came out to some colleagues. I got the sense that if Ipushed too far I would be pulled in for a conversation. I could have got the sack (William).Tom knew he could separate his personal and professional life and that he would not need to discuss his sexuality with colleagues andstudents. Hiding the truth gave Tom a safety net. He felt a sense of protection (Tom).My sexual orientation does not come into my teaching. Our focus is to educate and teach. My ethnicity has shaped my career more (Oliver).Agency The repeal of Section 28 has changed things, but it has been a delayed reaction. Much of the change didn’t happen in 2003 and it took time,but the repeal resulted in changes to equality legislation in 2010 and changes to the Ofsted framework after that (Jack).I don’t feel able to be open. My Vice Principal is a lesbian and she isn’t out either. I would not be comfortable being out in the role I’m doingwith the community that I serve. It is a predominantly Muslim community which makes it more difficult to prioritize a culture of acceptance … Iknow students suspect and have said things behind my back and some of the male staff of a particular ethnic faith have some issues aboutsexual orientation (Oliver).When I got my job in 2011, a small group of evangelical Christians said to the Head, we think you have just appointed a gay and we are nothappy about it. The Head was horrified. I decided I wasn’t going to edit myself out, partly because heterosexual staff don’t edit their lives, butalso partly to watch the fear behind their eyes (William).I was open about my sexuality from day 1 in my current school. I’m the Head so there is no one higher than me (Jack).I have freedom in the university to be open with students and colleagues about my sexual orientation. As a teacher educator I feel able to teachmy students about issues pertaining to sexuality or gender identity in schools because this is a requirement of the Equality Act and schoolinspection frameworks (Tom).Resilience I told him about the law and said to him, if you are not happy you can take your child elsewhere (Jack).If I get backlash from parents, I just say, it’s the law (William).If I can wrap LGBTQ+ issues up with the Equality Act, I will. I find it easier to talk about LGBTQ+ alongside other protected characteristics. Iwon’t say things that will identify me. Comments were made about me by a colleague in the junior team which were hurtful. I am not out to allstaff. I was told by my [line manager] not to go flaunting it around (Oliver).Stress In 2005 it was the early stages of my headship. The local authority had shortlisted the applications and I went to the teachers’ center to collectthem. One of the applications had a big star in the corner. I questioned this and was told that the feedback from the shortlisting panel was thatthis candidate was obviously gay. The local authority officers were endorsing homophobia after the repeal of Section 28. I thought, well I’m gay,I’d better be careful (Jack).I came out to colleagues but not explicitly to pupils … I got the sense that if I pushed too far I would be pulled in for a conversation (William).trapped inside a burning building. In his nightmares, he saw abuilding with no exit and no escape route. Tom became visiblyupset when he recalled the incident described in this vignette.The weather was bitterly cold and my hands and feet werefreezing. The sky was dull and the air was thick. The poundingrain was not enough to block out the smell of noxious smokeoozing from the tall chimneys of the long rows of terraced houses.It was overbearing. We lived in a former mining community—this was a place where men were meant to be men! Oliver and Iwere walking back to school. Going into town for lunch was a wayof escaping the pain and misery that we would have endured hadwe eaten in the school canteen. I had lost count of the number oftimes I had been called “a fucking gay faggot.”Suddenly, Simon ran up behind us. I didn’t see him comingand I certainly didn’t expect it. I thought that the bulliescongregated and ate together at school. He was short and spottybut he held a reputation for being tough. He began punchingme in the head and I crashed to the ground. My head hit thepavement and I blacked out. I gained consciousness but I couldnot see Oliver. Perhaps he had gone to get help. Blood wasstreaming down my face like a gushing waterfall. I could feelmy eyes swelling as Simon continued to kick me repeatedly inthe stomach.Simon started stamping on my head. “Die you fucking queer,you deserve to get AIDS.” The pain was unbearable, and I usedmy hands to protect my head. My head began to throb as thoughI had been hit by a car. I pleaded with him to stop and let me gobut he was wound up and roaring at me like a caged tiger. I curledinto a tight ball trying to protect my body. I could hear the trafficscreeching past, but no-one stopped. It lasted all of a few seconds,but it felt like hours. He crouched down and screamed right intomy face. “Queer! Arse-fucker, cock sucker, stay away from me.”The abuse continued. I felt trapped and Oliver had not returned.He had run off when Simon began punching me.I felt dirty and ashamed. At one point, I wanted him to killme. After all, I knew that I could not tell my parents whathad happened because I wasn’t out to them. My father wouldhave been disgusted. He had made his feelings clear. I knew mymother would be more understanding because she worked in agay nightclub, but I could not be sure she would accept me beinggay. I knew I couldn’t report it to the police, because they hatedpeople like me.All of a sudden a woman raced over the road and yelled atSimon. He stopped and cowardly ran away toward the school. Shechecked I was conscious, and I got up and made my way back toschool, terrified that he would be waiting round the next cornerto finish what he had started.The thought of meeting him again in school and of what hemight do to me made me feel sick to the pit of my stomach. Idecided to tell my form tutor, Mr. Orange, what had happened.Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 5241Stones and Glazzard Narratives of Gay TeachersMr. Orange was a decent man and a good English teacher. Heonce jokingly chastised me for writing “chocolate” on the front ofmy English book in front of his surname. He could have rippedme to pieces but he didn’t. I knew he liked me. I edited thebad language out of my account but told him the rest of whathad happened. He knew I wasn’t lying because my face was stillcovered in dried blood and dirt from the pavement. He listenedpatiently and his reply shocked me to the core. “Tom, there isnothing we can do because this took place outside of school. Justwatch where you go and stay away from him.” I had never feltsafe in school, and I now knew that this would never change.After years of suffering as a student, Tom wanted to makea difference. He wanted to be able to empower young childrenand make sure that they did not suffer throughout their ownschooling, like he had. Tom knew he needed to train and becomea teacher. After a 4 year course Tom was excited at the prospectof having his own class. It was 1998 and Tom had secured hisfirst interview for a teaching post. He had completed his teachingpractice placements in large schools located in sprawling councilestates. However, Tom’s interviewwas at a village primary locatedin a beautiful rural area. Immaculately maintained lawns frontedlarge detached houses, with luxury cars sat prominently on theirdrives. He was not used to places like this and already felt outof his depth. His sexuality strengthened these anxieties and hefeared that his identity would impede his success. Tom waswalking down a dark alley and knew nothing about what waswaiting for him ahead. In the following vignette, he recounts hisvivid memories of the recruitment and selection experience.It was a hot and sunny day in May. I had to catch a train anda bus to get to the school as I didn’t drive. The interview was oneof those grueling scenarios. It involved meeting the staff, havinglunch and talking to other candidates while sitting around allday waiting to be interviewed. The lunch was a disaster becauseit was dairy and meat. I am vegan but was too scared to sayanything in case it made me stand out or look odd. I couldn’tafford this at interview and I ate the meal. Sat opposite a panelof 12 interviewers, I then began to answer questions as they werefired at me one-by-one.“Why have you applied to be a Reception teacher?” Thequestion took me by surprise. There was an emphasis on why Iwanted to teach young children and not why I wanted to teach.The Chair of Governors was a fat, obnoxious man with darkrimmed spectacles and a receding hair line. “I want to teach kidsto read and write and give them a really good foundation.” Whenchatting to other candidates, I realized that they hadn’t beenasked this question. That realization made me feel uneasy.After the interview there was a torturously long wait.Suddenly, I was startled out of my thoughts. “Tom, the Headis ready to see you.” Walking toward his office, thoughts racedthrough my mind. “Your application for this post has beenunsuccessful.” I didn’t get the job. “We don’t think you will fitinto a school like this. We’re in a very middle-class area andthe parents here are really fussy.” My mind was flooded withemotions. Was it because they knew I was gay? Did they thinkI was too camp? Did they dislike the way I walked or talked?Why had the Chair of Governors asked me that question? Didthey think I was a pedophile? I was the best student on my4-year teacher training degree. I achieved distinctions in all ofmy teaching practices and I won the course prize for academicachievement. Why would I not fit in? I had never experiencedrejection like this before.Then came an about-turn. Dianne contacted me 3 days later.She had been one of the teachers who had interviewed me.“Tom, that job was yours. You scored the highest points in theinterview.” The Chair had blocked my appointment. “We cannothave a homosexual teaching in this school. What will the parentsthink?” Dianne thought that I should know.I was absolutely furious. I was not taking this news lyingdown. I wasn’t going to let someone who knew nothing abouteducation ruin my career. A career that I deserved! I contactedthe local authority and asked for the interview records to berecalled and scrutinized. I had been discriminated against and Ihad to make a stand. I felt it was my duty to all the other teacherslike me. Teachers who wanted to commit their working lives toeducation. I eventually received an embarrassed apology fromthe local authority and was offered the job. I didn’t want to workthere but I needed the job so reluctantly I accepted. There musthave been some serious hand slapping that week although to mydismay no one lost their job.Despite the challenges he faced in securing a teaching post,Tom felt reassured. He knew he could separate his personaland professional life and that he would not need to discuss hissexuality with colleagues and students. Hiding the truth gaveTom a safety net. He felt a sense of protection. He remainedin that school for a decade and only disclosed his sexuality tocolleagues he felt he could trust. He thenmoved into an academiccareer in higher education where he was able to openly disclosehis sexuality and merge his personal and professional identities.JackIt was 1996 and Jack was looking to secure his first teaching post.He had lived inManchester for most of his life though he knew hecould never work there. He was only applying for posts in Leeds.It was an easy decision for Jack to make. He felt he needed a roleon the other side of the Pennines so that he could separate hispersonal life from his job. He felt unable to bring the two together.When he had been looking for jobs, he never considered any inManchester. After several years of working as a primary teacher,he moved schools and became a senior leader. He did not comeout in his new school. The thought of doing so made his heartrace. He feared that members of staff and governors might havean issue with it. He couldn’t afford that. In 1996, the culture wasvery different under Section 28. He felt that his sexuality might bean issue for staff and children. He never told them. As a DeputyHeadteacher and Headteacher, Jack had responsibility for staffrecruitment. In this vignette, he describes an incident he willnever forget.Early in my career as a Head we used a local authority poolsystem for teachers to apply for jobs. Teachers applied to a pooland could be recruited to work in any school in the authority. Thelocal authority did the shortlisting and then the Heads lookedat the application forms of those who had been shortlisted andoffered interviews in their schools. I remember in 2005 goingdown to the teachers’ center to look at a batch of shortlistedFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 5242Stones and Glazzard Narratives of Gay Teachersapplication forms. We needed a newly qualified teacher and Iwas desperate to appoint someone to the role. I pulled out oneapplication form and I was puzzled why someone had drawn abig star and a circle on it. I questioned what this meant. “Whatdo these annotations mean?” The local authority officer repliedstraight away without hesitation. “The candidate was worthy ofbeing interviewed but the shortlisting panel felt it necessary todraw attention to the fact that the candidate was obviously gay.”In a heartbeat, memories and feelings came flooding back tome. It was 2005 and the local authority officers were endorsinghomophobia. Section 28 has been repealed but its legacy stillcast a shadow. I was appalled and scared. I am gay. I needto be careful. Section 28 was repealed in 2003 and I saw verylittle in terms of change. There was very little change at thattime anyway, but I knew that Ofsted would not have prioritizedLGBTQ+ inclusion without Section 28 being repealed. Somechanges did happen, though these took many years. Equalitylegislation and the revisions to the Ofsted framework providedsome momentum. When Section 28 was repealed, people werestill scared. Schools could now talk about gay people, but manywere too frightened to do so for several years.Jack has now led his current school as Head for 10 years. Hedecided to come out to staff and students immediately after hisappointment. At that time, he had never anticipated being able todrive an agenda to promote LGBTQ+ inclusion. He knows thatattitudes have changed significantly in recent years although thefear of parental backlash has stayed with him for 10 years. He nowseeks protection through his role as Head. He knows that there isno one higher than him to halt the work he is doing to promoteLGBTQ+ inclusion. Jack describes his work in this vignette.We started this work 5 or 6 years ago. Back then, thingswere different. “You’re gay.” “That’s so gay.” The word “gay”was used by students as the insult of choice. It meant rubbish,bad, broken, and stupid. Boys who were not interested in footballwere often subjected to homophobic bullying. The culture wastoxic. The bullying was endemic. We had to act. I felt theweight of responsibility. I had to lead this change and I wasnow responsible for its success. We worked with an LGBTQ+charity to develop staff confidence. Our work raised the profileof LGBTQ+ inclusion and some bullying stopped although Icontinued to drive change with commitment and momentum.Kids stopped using the word “gay” because they knew thatthere would be consequences. We tried to normalize LGBTQ+identities as much as possible. The governors were on board andthey believed in our final destination. They shared my vision andthey had responded well to LGBTQ+ training. Initially, we didn’thighlight this work to parents. It was on our website, though I wastoo scared to make a thing of it.We are now building a snowball. Each generation is moreaccepting than the previous generation. LGBTQ+ visibilityin society continues to improve and this drives furtheradvancement. People are beginning to understand how LGBTQ+identities can exist within family structures. Parents are less likelyto complain. My school is in an area of social deprivation. Someparents come from black African heritage and wanted me toexplain the work we were doing. Some of my parents are racist.They know it is not acceptable to be racist on school groundsand it is exactly the same for LGBTQ+. I am not going to stopadvancing inclusion simply because they do not like it.Jack now collaborates with other schools who are developingtheir LGBTQ+ inclusion policies. Although he has developedand advanced LGBTQ+ inclusion in his own setting, he knowsthat the national picture remains variable and inconsistent. Hiswork with other schools continues to reveal staff resistance andthat many schools are facing challenges. In this final vignette, hedescribes the fear factor.I work in other schools. There is still some apathy from staff.“We don’t have a problem here.” Getting some staff to see thevalue of this work can be a challenge sometimes. It can be difficultto get them to realize that it is not just about doing a one-offlesson. It is about the ethos, culture and the curriculum of theschool. It is not about ticking a box. I ask big questions to supporttheir thinking and reflection. “What challenges do you face inrelation to LGBTQ+ inclusion.” “The parents.” It is in the Ofstedframework yet there is still a fear factor.In 2018 we ran a rainbow day. We showed the children videosof Pride and we hosted a whole school Pride parade. We hadposters and banners. I was worried at the time that it would endup in the Daily Mail. A couple of parents came into school tocomplain about our “themed days.” One of them said he had an“issue” with it. I told him about the law and Ofsted. “If you arenot happy then you can take your child elsewhere.”WilliamIt was late 1990s and William was teaching in the independentsector. It was a boarding school and he lived in the boys’ boardinghouse. He didn’t lie about his sexuality if people asked himalthough he did try to keep it low key. He came out to somecolleagues and he knew he could never tell pupils. His school wassupportive though he sensed that if he pushed it too far the schoolwould pull him in for a conversation. Everything was alwaysat stake. He constantly worried that he could be dismissed forbeing gay. The secrecy was always there. In this vignette, Williamdescribes his move into middle leadership.I moved into a middle leadership role after 9 years. It wasanother independent school and the year was 2010. I just thoughtto myself “this isn”t good enough; I’m not going to edit myself ’.When I got the job a small group of evangelical Christians hadspoken to the Head about my appointment. “We think you havejust appointed a gay and we are not happy about it.” The Headwas horrified and ordered them out of the office. When I arrived,I treated them kindly. I wanted to watch the fear behind theireyes. I am from a faith background andmy husband is from Indiaso I want people to understand that you can have a religion andalso be gay.I am completely open about my sexual orientation and thisschool has been wonderful. My husband and I got married in theschool. I sometimes experience a little bit of homophobia. It isthe casual language that pupils use. “That’s gay.” “This is gay.”I pick up on it calmly. “As a gay man I find that offensive andI’d rather you didn’t say it.” One boy spent a whole week tryingto apologize to me. I have experienced a bit of resistance fromstaff. Some have implied that I have a personal agenda. It doesn’tbother me because I have support from the Head and Deputy.Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 9 July 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 5243Stones and Glazzard Narratives of Gay TeachersI talk about my personal life with my husband in school. If itis acceptable for a heterosexual colleague to bring their personallives in to school, it is also acceptable for me to do the same. Ourpersonal and professional lives overlap because this is a boardingschool. We spend a lot of time with our pupils and they liketo get to know us. Some colleagues have told me to keep myprivate life separate from my work life. I always give the sameresponse. “You don’t, why should I?” Sometimes I get excludedfrom heterosexual conversations, so I tell people straight that theyare excluding me. I often tell people that it is okay for them toask me questions about my life. Sometimes they treat my life as ataboo subject, which it isn’t.William now leads LGBTQ+ inclusion in his school. He’s ledsurveys with parents, pupils and staff and he implemented anLGB policy and a separate transgender policy. He believes that therepeal of Section 28made no difference to LGBTQ+ inclusion. Inthis vignette, he explains how the Equality Act (2010) gave himopportunities to advance inclusion.The Equality Act in 2010 reversed the damage of Section 28,not its repeal. As a result of the Equality Act I have done a lotof work on LGBT inclusion in the school. We have embeddedLGBT identities into the curriculum to increase visibility. I haveinvited LGBT rolemodels into the school. I am a Stonewall schoolchampion now and I support other schools with LGBT inclusion.Sometimes I get backlash from parents. I always refer to equalitylegislation during my conversations with parents. We introduceda gender-neutral dress code and one father complained. “All theboys will be wandering around in fishnet tights.” “That says moreabout how you feel about women than anything else.” I haveorganized a knowledge-exchange conference for schools to cometogether and share ideas and I invited LGBTQ+ students.We don’t do things that are over the top, such as launchinga drag show! We have not created an LGBT group becausethis just becomes a gay ghetto and excludes those who are notready to come out. Instead, we have set up an equality groupwhich includes LGBTQ+ pupils. We write an annual reportto governors and audit school policies to make sure they areLGBTQ+ inclusive.We have trained all staff in how to respond toLGBTQ+ bullying and we have included books in the library thatare written by LGBTQ+ authors, address LGBTQ+ experiencesand LGBTQ+ identities. We don’t do drop-down days as weembed it through the whole school. We have changed applicationforms to make them gender neutral and we create opportunitiesfor LGBTQ+ role models to visit the school. I want it to beboring, routine, and humdrum so that it is ordinary and just runof the mill. You need someone in the school to drive it. It doesn’thave to be an LGBTQ+ person, but it kind of does! You needsomeone to lead it who understands the issues. It has to be partof their lived experiences. You can do it hypothetically but thereis an emptiness to it. It would be a bit like having men trying toorganize a women’s rights movement.William knows he’s lucky to work in a school that proactivelypromotes LGBTQ+ inclusion. In this final vignette, he describesthe current challenges that many schools still face.The biggest issue is lack of time and finding the space to dothis essential work. I have spoken in Muslim schools, schoolsin areas of social deprivation or schools where there are gypsypupils. In those schools I have faced higher levels of resistanceand aggression. I know a colleague who works in a Catholicschool and they [senior leadership team] have told her not tospeak about her sexuality. They have forced her into the closet.She has experienced homophobic abuse from pupils because they[senior leaders] are covertly condoning it. Some people think thataddressing issues of sexuality is teaching pupils about sex. We arenot sitting kids down and telling them to have gay sex. We areteaching them about identity.OliverOliver started teaching in the late 1990s. His identity as a gay mandoesn’t come into his work and he has never been open about hissexual orientation. In this vignette, Oliver vividly recounts somepainful memories.When I was appointed as a Deputy, I filled in the equalopportunities form and identified as gay. I was then asked directlyin the interview if I was gay. Another colleague told me that Ishould have walked out at that point. In 2015 I was appointedin an interim Head role and both Executive Head Teachers wereblack. “I noticed on the form that you are gay, don’t go flaunting itaround.” I didn’t last long in that role because her values clashedwith my own.In my current school I am not able to be open. My VicePrincipal is also a lesbian and she is not out. We are not a faithschool, but the pupils are predominantly Muslim, and there arecultural traditions in the community. It is an area of high crimeso we must prioritize other things such as behavior and safety.It is a small school so the capacity of the staff to do things isseriously stretched.My sexual orientation does not come into my teaching.My focus is to educate and teach! As a Head I would notbe comfortable being out, due to the role I’m doing and thecommunity that we serve. One pupil came into our school andhe was openly gay. He was teased and taunted. There was a lackof respect toward him. We have a high percentage of Muslimstudents. It is fine to be gay as long as you are not practicing thefaith. I have never been out with my students. I’m happy to doLGBTQ+ history and LGBT Pride but that is about it. I am notout to all staff. There are some staff who I would not trust.I experienced homophobia in my first middle leadership rolein an independent school. I once went for an interview and therewas one Asian candidate, one black African candidate and onewhite British candidate. It made me think about whether I wasbeing judged for the role on my merits or whether they were justtrying to tick boxes. I wonder how many Heads are LGBTQ+because that is never talked about. However, we need to representdiversity in school leadership teams.I know that my students suspect and have said things behindmy back. Some of the staff inmy school see LGBT as a taboo topicand are not happy to teach it. Some of the male Muslim staff havesome issues with specific protected characteristics which they arenot prepared to promote. I am not prepared to lead on LGBTQ+inclusion. The Vice Principal leads on it. Sometimes it is donethrough a token gesture by addressing LGBT history month ordoing an assembly on it. The curriculum has to serve the contextFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 10 July 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 5244Stones and Glazzard Narratives of Gay Teachersof the school so LGBT inclusion is not a priority forme. The focusis on keeping the children safe!DISCUSSIONThe themes of identity, agency, and resilience were identifiedas common themes across the four narratives. Four decadesago, Goodson (1980) stated that “in understanding something sointensely personal as teaching, it is critical we know about theperson the teacher is” (p. 69). It has been argued that ‘professionalwork cannot and should not be divorced from the lives ofprofessionals’ (Goodson and Sikes, 2001, p. 71).Teacher IdentityIt has been argued that teacher identity is neither static norcoherent but that it is fragmented and always in a state offlux (Smith, 2007). Thus, teacher identity is not a stable entity.Instead, it is continually reconstructed as a product of conflictingpractices and discourses (Sikes et al., 1985; Day et al., 2006). It is“always deferred and in the process of becoming—never really,never yet, never absolutely there” (MacLure, 2003, p. 131).Tom, Jack, and William’s had actively chosen to intertwinetheir personal and professional identities and had decided to usetheir personal identities to advance LGBTQ+ inclusion withintheir schools. However, Jack, William, and Tom all separatedtheir personal and professional identities when they startedteaching in the 1990s. In the initial stages of their careers, they feltrestrained by the force of the heterosexual matrix (Butler, 1990)which was upheld by Section 28. They experienced a culture ofcompulsory heterosexuality (Rich, 1980) and their stigmatizedidentities were displaced (Vicars, 2006). They negotiated theirsexualities in school in various different ways. These includedbeing selectively out to colleagues but not students (William)or covering up (Goffman, 1963) their sexuality and personalidentities (Tom and Jack).They made a deliberate decision to intertwine their personaland professional identities later in their careers, followingchanges to legislative and other regulatory frameworks whichprovided them with protection and permission to advanceLGBTQ+ inclusion within their educational contexts. Literaturehas highlighted how teacher agency and identity are inter-related(Barcelos, 2015). Tom, William, and Jack were able to allow theirpersonal and professional identities to overlap. They used theiridentities to support their efforts to promote LGBTQ+ inclusion.In contrast, Oliver maintained a division between his personaland professional identities which restricted his agency.Seminal work on teacher identity has illustrated how theprofessional and personal selves become integrated to producea coherent self (Nias, 1989) whereas other work has highlightedthe tensions that exist between substantial and situational selves(Sikes et al., 1985;Woods and Jeffrey, 2002). Although Tom, Jack,and William had integrated their personal identities to producea coherent teacher identity, this was not the case for Oliverwho felt compelled to hide his personal identity due to strongreligious community that his school served. Teaching assigns oneducators a social identity which links teacher effectiveness withthe ability to maintain a commitment to improving educationaloutcomes (Jeffrey and Troman, 2012). For Oliver, this socialidentity was more significant to him than his sexuality. Oliverbelieved that his primary role as a leader was to focus on raisingeducational standards rather than focusing on his own sexualityand advancing LGBTQ+ inclusion. Clarke (2009) argues thatteachers have an ethical obligation to reflect on their identitiesand to engage in identity work by “claiming” their identity.However, this is not always possible, and this was evident withOliver who, despite legislation which offered him protection,felt it necessary to maintain a clear separation between thedifferent aspects of his identity, resulting in a fragmented andnon-authentic identity during his work as a teacher.Webb and Vulliamy (2006) have demonstrated how teachersare able to subvert, reject, and recast the dominant politicalversions of what it means to be a teacher, thus enabling themto assert their own professional values on their identity. Clarke(2009) argues that it is possible for teachers to author their ownidentities and William, Jack, and Tom each managed to do thissuccessfully, despite having their identities constrained in theearly stages of their teaching careers. The equality legislation andinspection framework supported their confidence in disclosingtheir personal identities in school, advancing LGBTQ+ inclusion,and negotiating parental resistance. It therefore seems thatidentity formation is a continual process of negotiation and “apotential site of agency” (Clarke, 2009, p. 187) but the extent towhich teachers are assigned agency is influenced by the contextsin which teachers work.AgencyPantic’s model of teacher agency (Pantić, 2015) includes fourfactors that influence agency. Firstly, the teacher’s sense ofpurpose is critical to their agency. Tom, William, and Jackall demonstrated a clear sense of purpose which was centeredon promoting equality and social justice. Secondly, teachercompetence facilitates or restricts agency. All participants hadachieved senior or middle leadership positions in education.Although Oliver’s agency was restricted by religious discourses,William, Jack, and Tom were assigned agency because theywere competent teachers who were capable of developingwhole institutional approaches to LGBTQ+ inclusion. Thirdly,autonomy was identified as a critical aspect of teacher agency.Tom, William, and Jack were given considerable autonomy todevelop their work on LGBTQ+ inclusion. They were trustedby their line managers and the degree of autonomy which theywere assigned allowed them to be agentic. This was not thecase for Oliver. Finally, the model includes reflexivity whichdenotes the ability of the teacher to mediate or overcome barriersthat obstruct their sense of purpose. This emerged stronglyin William’s narrative when he encountered staff and parentalresistance to his work. His ability to resist these obstacles meantthat his agency was not restricted. Jack also skilfully challengedparental resistance to his agency so that his sense of purpose wasnot detrimentally affected.ResilienceGreenfield (2015) model of teacher resilience demonstrates howresilient teachers have a sense of hope, purpose, and beliefFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 11 July 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 5245Stones and Glazzard Narratives of Gay Teachersin themselves as teachers (self-efficacy). These core beliefs areindividual characteristics which play a critical role in resilience.The model demonstrates how resilient teachers form meaningfulrelationships with others within their setting and undertakeactions to effect change and mediate the challenges they face.The model demonstrates how wider systemic factors alsoinfluence resilience.Tom, Jack and William demonstrated a deep commitmentto equality and social justice. This motivated them to advanceLGBTQ+ inclusion within their contexts. All four participantswere highly successful educators and in relatively powerfulpositions. Their teacher-efficacy was high, and this supportedthem to be resilient to the challenges they faced. Relationshipswith colleagues were critical to their resilience and the work theyundertook (actions) within their schools was critical to sustainingtheir motivation. Jack and William both faced challenges fromparents and William also faced challenges from other staff withstrong religious views, but the protection they were providedby the Equality Act (2010) and by the Office for Standardsin Education Ofsted (2018) Framework enabled them to beresilient to these challenges. In contrast, Oliver’s resilience wasdetrimentally affected by the religious context of the school inwhich he worked.Minority StressAll participants had experienced a degree of minority stressat specific points in their careers. In some cases, distalstressors were caused by the actual experience of prejudiceor discrimination. Tom was bullied for being gay andexperienced direct discrimination during his interviews forteaching posts. Oliver was directly asked about his sexualorientation during a teaching interview and instructed to repressit. William experienced discrimination from other staff upon hisappointment and Jack had experienced prejudice from parents.All participants had experienced the pressure to negotiate theirsexuality during their early teaching careers and anticipatednegative reactions to disclosures of their personal identity(proximal stressors).All participants drew on the support from family, friends,or other networks to mitigate the effects of stress. The EqualityAct (2010) and the Ofsted inspection framework resulted inTom, William, and Jack feeling confident in merging theirpersonal identities with their teacher identities. All participantshad secured leadership positions in various sectors of education,and this gave them high levels of teacher efficacy which mitigatedthe effects of minority stress. The protection offered by thelegislative context increased their resilience and reduced theeffects of minority stress, with the exception of Oliver whoexperienced minority stress as a result of the religious contextin which he worked. The positive institutional ethos and culturewhich Tom, Jack, and William experienced mitigated the effectsof minority stress.The findings suggest that it may be possible to adapt Meyer(2003) model of minority stress by including a wider range ofcoping strategies which mitigate the effects of minority stress.Meyer (2003) included social support as a coping mechanismbut the data suggest that legislative and other policy frameworks(for example, inspection frameworks) can increase resilienceand mitigate stress. The data also suggest that high levelsof self-efficacy and positive institutional cultures can alsomitigate stress.CONCLUSIONThe narratives demonstrate that Section 28 had a detrimentalimpact on the teacher agency of all participants. Consequently,in the early stages of their teaching careers, the participantswere forced to conceal or negotiate their sexualities in school.The repeal of Section 28 did not immediately result in greaterteacher agency, nor did it allow them to intertwine theirpersonal and professional identities to produce a coherentteacher identity. Greater agency was assigned following theintroduction of equality legislation and regulatory frameworksfor school inspections. These developments supported Tom,Jack, and William to author their own identities as teachersby merging their personal and professional identities They alsoenabled them to stay resilient in the face of hostile reactionsfrom parents or colleagues, either in relation to their sexualityor in relation to the work they were doing in school to promoteLGBTQ+ inclusion. In contrast to the others, Oliver’s accountdemonstrates the tensions between religion and sexuality andhighlights how these tensions can constrain teacher identity,agency, and restrict resilience.Existing literature is dominated by accounts which positionqueer teachers as victims. We were concerned that this locatesthem within a victimized framework. Although the accounts thatwe have presented illuminate negative experiences, the narrativesare largely positive, in contrast with existing literature. Thereis a need to re-conceptualize queer teachers to by locatingtheir experiences within positive narratives which re-positionthem as resilient, skilled professionals who are active agentswith potential to contribute to the advancement of inclusionand social justice within education. The repetition of victimizedaccounts which dominates existing literature only presents apartial account of the experiences of queer teachers. There isa need to create stories of empowerment which highlight thecontribution that queer teachers can make to inclusion andsocial justice rather than repeating narratives of discriminationand prejudice.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTThe original contributions presented in the study are includedin the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can bedirected to the corresponding authors.ETHICS STATEMENTThe studies involving human participants were reviewedand approved by Leeds Trinity University Research EthicsCommittee.

Raising OurAmbition for Trans Children inPrimary and Secondary SchoolsCal Horton*Education Department, Goldsmiths University, London, United KingdomAs more trans children find the confidence to make themselves known in our primaryand secondary schools, school teachers and administrators look for guidance on how tobest support trans pupils. This article synthesises findings from global literature on transchildren in primary and secondary education (K1–12 in the US), extracting key themesand conclusions. It then examines the most recent UK school guidance documents ontrans inclusion, assessing which lessons and recommendations from global literature arerepresented. The article highlights existing good practices in visibility and representationand in protection from violence and harassment. Several areas where additional effortis needed are identified, including action on environmental stress and cisnormativity,addressing barriers to school trans-inclusivity and institutional accountability. A numberof important shifts are called for: from adaptation on request to pre-emptive change; fromaccommodation to a rights-based approach; from pathologisation to trans-positivity.Finally, the article raises expectations on what it means to be an ally for trans childrenin education.Keywords: trans, transgender, child, school, education, youth, primary, secondaryINTRODUCTIONThe twenty-first century has seen a global movement away from pathologisation of gender diversity(Bryant, 2006, 2007; Ehrensaft, 2012; Menvielle, 2012; Spack et al., 2012). Gender affirmativeapproaches to supporting trans children are becoming mainstream (Hidalgo et al., 2013; CASWACTS, 2015; Ehrensaft, 2016; Murchison et al., 2016; Lopez et al., 2017; Oliphant et al., 2018;Rafferty et al., 2018; Turban and Ehrensaft, 2018). This shift toward gender affirmative approachesis underpinned by evidence of the damage to trans children caused by childhood abuse andrejection, including the harm of conversion therapy (Roberts et al., 2012; Ashley, 2019b; Turbanet al., 2019).There is now strong evidence that socially transitioned children who are supported have goodlevels of well-being and mental health (Ehrensaft, 2016; Olson, 2016; Durwood et al., 2017;Ehrensaft et al., 2018). Factors associated with improved well-being in trans children include familyfunctioning (Katz-Wise et al., 2018), family support (Travers et al., 2012; Simons et al., 2013; Kleinand Golub, 2016), and use of chosen name (Russell et al., 2018). Informed by global healthcare bestpractices (Oliphant et al., 2018) trans children are increasingly likely to receive love and supportin childhood (Ehrensaft, 2016), including transitions at or before primary school (Miller, 2016a;Davy and Cordoba, 2019). Many trans children are aware of their identity at a young age (Jonesand Hillier, 2013; Telfer et al., 2015; Fast and Olson, 2018) meaning a majority of educators willat some point work with trans pupils, although teachers may not be aware of the trans children50Horton Raising Ambition for Trans Childrenin their classroom (Rands, 2009; Meyer and Leonardi, 2018).Educators can look to a variety of trans inclusion school guidancedocuments to shape their support for trans pupils of all ages.It is important that these guidance documents are informed bythe most up to date literature on trans children. This paperaims to review whether best practices from research literature ontrans children in education is feeding through into guidance onsupporting trans children in our schools.Until recently, trans children have been almost invisiblein both academic literature and public consciousness, withgender diversity problematised and hidden (Brill and Pepper,2008; Gill-Peterson, 2018). A majority of older literature ontrans children was pathologising and cisnormative1 (Ansaraand Hegarty, 2012). There has been a recent growth in transpositive research on trans children, looking at the identities ofyoung trans children (Olson et al., 2015; Olson, 2016; Fast andOlson, 2018; Olson and Enright, 2018; Olson and Gülgöz, 2018;Rae et al., 2019; Pullen Sansfaçon et al., 2020), reflecting onsocial transition (Turban, 2017; Whyatt-Sames, 2017; Turbanand Keuroghlian, 2018; Ashley, 2019a,c), and trans children’sexperiences in education (Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a).Research is now examining the external challenges experiencedby trans children and families (Capous-Desyllas and Barron,2017; Alegría, 2018), including the impact discrimination, andstructural cisnormativity2 (Hendricks and Testa, 2012; McBride,2020). This builds upon wider work on the Minority StressModel (Meyer, 2003); the ways in which experiences of prejudice,stigma and discrimination negatively impact on mental health.Modern, trans-positive research on trans children in educationlooks at cisnormativity and the structural and systemic barriersto trans children having equality of opportunity in our schools(Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a; McBride, 2020).In this paper the term “trans children” will be used. Transchildren includes transgender and or non-binary children, alsodescribed as “gender diverse children” (Keo-Meier and Ehrensaft,2018). “Cis” is a term for non-trans or cisgender people. Whereall ages under 18 are included (including the youngest pre-primary and primary school children) the term children willbe used. Where necessary this will be divided either into transchildren and trans adolescents and where appropriate the termtrans young people or trans youth will be used, with the termyouth excluding younger children and including young adults(UNDESA, 2013).A trans-emancipatory approach informs this research,aiming to proactively avoid pathologisation or cisnormativity,recognising the rights of trans children to equality of opportunityin education. Additional research standards are needed for1Cisnormativity is the assumption that everyone is cisgender or should be (Keo-Meier and Ehrensaft, 2018). Serano talked about the concept as a societal double-standard that conveys social and legal legitimacy on cis people’s identities, with cisidentities “taken for granted and considered valid in a way that trans people’s arenot’’, providing cis people with an advantage (Serano, 2011, 29).2Structural cisnormativity exacts disproportionate harms on trans people,threatening their health, reducing their security and limiting their opportunities(Newbury, 2013). Daily, unpredictable, distressing encounters with structuralcisnormativity, leaves trans people in a “constant state of alert” that “manifests as apersistent level of stress unknown to their cis counterpart” (Newbury, 2013, 2).research on trans communities “because of a long history ofintolerance, bias, and psychopathological stereotyping in thisspecialty” (ITHF, 2019, 1). Vincent (2018) outlines six categoriesto consider when working on trans-related research includingnuanced language use and recognising trans histories. Ethicalresearch needs to consider and address the long and continuingpathologisation of trans children, including past and continuingrights violations, producing research that respects the needs andrights of trans children in education today.I write this as a parent of a trans child of primary school ageand an advocate for trans children’s rights. Our trans childrenare brilliant and spectacular and ordinary—in many ways theyare exactly the same as their cis classmates. Yet too often transchildren are failed by our cisnormative systems and priorities, toooften these children face prejudice and ignorance, too often theyshoulder the burden of educating the adults around them. Pastgenerations of trans children have been abused and harmed—lessons need to be learnt today, to build a better world fortomorrow’s trans children.RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND METHODSThis paper comprises two strands, responding to two sequentialresearch questions.1. What are key themes, findings, and recommendations fromresearch literature on trans children in education?2. Which of these research driven themes, findings, andrecommendations are being prioritised in trans-related schoolpolicy and guidance documents?These research questions are timely for a UK audience, as schoolsmove toward LGBT inclusive primary school RelationshipsEducation (Department of Education, 2019). These researchquestions are also timely globally, in a period where transinclusive education is under threat in countries across theworld, from anti trans legislation targeting trans children inthe US, through to toxic political and media driven debateson trans inclusive education in Australia, Canada and beyond(Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a).Part one of the research involved an extensive review ofglobal literature on trans children in education. Databasesincluding Educational Research Abstracts Online, EducationResearch Information Center (ERIC), and Web of Science weresearched using paired key words including: transgender∗/trans∗and school∗, reviewing articles published between 2005 and2020 inclusive. An in-depth review of article bibliographiessupplemented through researcher expertise enabledidentification of additional articles (McBride, 2020). Inclusioncriteria on literature type were kept broad to include greyliterature studies, and to include commentary, review andanalysis articles. Only articles published in English wereincluded, and only articles relating to primary and secondaryeducation, with articles on tertiary education excluded. Thissearch identified articles that provide quantitative or qualitativeinsights on trans pupils’ experience in education, looking atliterature on trans children under 18, with literature from theFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 2 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6751Horton Raising Ambition for Trans ChildrenTABLE 1 | List of trans-inclusion school resources.Brighton (Brighton and Hove CityCouncil, 2019)Trans inclusion schools toolkitCofE (Church of EnglandEducation Office, 2019)Valuing all god’s children: guidance forChurch of England schools on challenginghomophobic, biphobic, and transphobicbullyingEANI (Education AuthorityNorthern Ireland, 2019)Guidance for schools, EOTAS Centres andyouth service on supporting transgenderyoung peopleEqualiteach (Equaliteach, 2020) Free to be: embedding lgbt+ equality andtackling homophobic, biphobic, andtransphobic bullying in primary schoolsLeeds (Leeds City Council, 2018) Guidance on supporting children and youngpeople who are trans or who are questioningtheir gender identity for all schools andchildren and families services settingsLGBT Youth Scotland (LGBTYouth Scotland, 2017)Supporting transgender young people:guidance for schools in ScotlandNEU (National Education Union,2018)Supporting trans and gender-questioningstudentsOrthodox Jewish Schools (ChiefRabbi Ephraim Mirvis, 2018)The wellbeing of LGBT Pupils a guide fororthodox jewish schoolsStonewall BPG (Stonewall, 2018) Best practice guide: how primary schools arecelebrating difference and tacklinghomophobia, biphobia and transphobiaStonewall Next Steps (Stonewall,2020)Next steps in inclusive educationStonewall Primary (Stonewall,2019)Creating an LGBT-inclusive primarycurriculumTrans Inclusion Toolkit (TransInclusion Toolkit, 2019)Trans inclusion toolkit for schoolslast 5 years prioritised. All identified literature was coded usingNvivo software, identifying themes related to trans children’sexperiences in education. Eight main themes emerged and theseare presented in the literature review section.Part two of the research analysed a selection of guidelineson trans inclusion in education, examining the degree to whichthemes from the literature review were profiled in the schoolguidance documents. Relevant primary and or secondary schoolguidance documents were identified, selecting those which madespecific reference to trans inclusion. This included guides ontrans children, trans young people, LGBT young people or guideson HBT (Homophobic, Biphobic, Transphobic) bullying. Schoolguidance documents published prior to 2017 were excluded;the most recently released or updated guides were prioritised.Whilst part one took a global overview of literature on transchildren in education, part two narrowed the scope to UK schoolguidance documents—though the findings here are likely to haverelevance for educators interested in supporting trans children inany country.Twelve guidance documents were selected for review, andthese are listed in Table 1 below. One guide that is activelytransphobic3 was excluded. The review did not aim to provide a3See https://www.stonewall.org.uk/node/62946forensic analysis of any specific guide, but rather to see how wellkey themes from the literature are represented in school guidancedocuments. Several of these guides were produced by civil societyorganisations. Two were from religious organisations (Churchof England and Jewish Orthodox). Several were produced byEnglish councils, two were associated with regional devolvedgovernment and one was produced by the National EducationUnion. The 2019 Trans Inclusion Toolkit produced by multipleEnglish Councils is currently facing challenge from groupsopposed to trans equality, and later versions of this toolkitcurrently being revised by local authorities may be significantlydifferent to the 2019 version reviewed here. Notably missingfrom this list is any England and Wales government endorsedresource, though guidance from the Equalities and Human RightCommission for England Scotland and Wales is anticipated.GLOBAL LITERATURE REVIEW ON TRANSCHILDREN IN EDUCATIONThis section highlights eight themes derived from a systematicanalysis of global literature on trans children’s experience ineducation. The themes include (1) Pathologisation and victimnarratives (2) Discrimination and violence (3) Environmentalstress and cisnormativity (4) Individual accommodation onrequest (5) From school panic to affirmation and representation(6) Teacher barriers to action (7) Ambition and allies (8)Child voice and child rights. These themes and findingsshould shape the ways in which schools support their transpupils, acknowledging the weaknesses of the current literatureincluding limited consideration of non-binary children, andlimited consideration of intersectionality.Pathologisation and Victim NarrativesThere is a long history of pathologisation, misgendering andinvalidation of trans children that cuts across all spheres ofsociety including our schools (Frohard-Dourlent, 2018; Gill-Peterson, 2018). Ansara and Hegarty (2012, 152) highlightthe ways in which pathologising or cisnormative languagecan “dehumanize, silence and erase.” This pathologisationdirectly affects trans children’s experience in school. Riggs andBartholomaeus (2018) provides an example of a parent of a 5 yearold trans girl being asked by a school to provide a psychiatristreport and have genetic testing before the school might accepther. Pathologising approaches can also be expressed in moresubtle ways which nevertheless erase and delegitimise (Frohard-Dourlent, 2018), such as when trans children’s identities aredenied, or replaced with pathologising and delegitimising terms.The avoidance of the word trans when referring to trans childrenis a form of erasure, that denies trans children “self-intelligibility”(Kennedy, 2018, 135).There is a tradition of stigmatization and problematisation oftrans children (Pyne, 2014; Kennedy, 2018) with trans childrendefined through their association with trauma (Marx et al., 2017).Educators also need framings that centre joy, romance, laughter,strength, and resilience (Marx et al., 2017; Shelton and Lester,2018). Trans pupils, living in cisnormative environments, mayFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 3 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6752Horton Raising Ambition for Trans Childrendevelop particular strengths, types of cultural capital (Pennell,2016a). This can include navigational capacity, being able tonavigate through systems not designed for trans pupils; linguisticcapacity, challenging linguistic norms that marginalise, erase orother trans pupils; familial capacity, finding support from transpeers, trans communities and trans-led narratives; and resistantcapital, being able to fight against discrimination and advocatefor equality (Pennell, 2016b).Descriptions of trans children and youth often centre avictim narrative (DePalma and Jennett, 2010), framing themas in need of protection (Marx et al., 2017). This singularand simplistic framing as “at risk” (Frohard-Dourlent, 2018)homogenises, pathologises and others trans youth as inherentlyseparate from healthy cis peers (Miller, 2016c; Marx et al., 2017;Blair and Deckman, 2019). A victim framing also individualisesthe challenges trans pupils face (Shelton and Lester, 2018),overlooking the structural inequalities harming them (Smith andPayne, 2016).Discrimination and ViolenceTrans children face multiple areas of overt discrimination,including segregation and denial of access to appropriatelygendered spaces (Kennedy, 2013; Kosciw and Pizmony-Levy,2016; O’Flynn, 2016; UNESCO, 2016; Kuvalanka et al., 2019;Neary, 2019). School-based anti-trans discrimination targetingtrans pupils of all ages is apparent in a number of surveys,with trans pupils prevented from using their name or pronounat school, and forced to use inappropriately gendered facilities(Kosciw et al., 2016, 2018). Harm is compounded when schoolsenable trans children to be drawn into public debates on whetherschools should actively discriminate against trans pupils (Herriotet al., 2018; Miller et al., 2018; Sinclair-Palm and Gilbert, 2018).Evidence from diverse locations continues to show transpupils experiencing hostile school climates (Greytak et al., 2009;Grant and Zwier, 2011; Taylor and Peter, 2011; Kosciw et al.,2012, 2016, 2018; Peter et al., 2016; Ullman, 2017; Fayles, 2018;Human Rights Campaign, 2018) with high incidences of verbalharassment, bullying, physical abuse, and sexual harassment(Reed et al., 2010; Human Rights Campaign, 2014, 2018; Kosciwet al., 2016; Peter et al., 2016; Bradlow et al., 2017). Kosciwet al. (2018) found a steady increase in negative remarks abouttrans people in schools between 2013 and 2017, highlighting thatprogress is neither linear nor guaranteed. Trans pupils report lackof safety across multiple locations, including in primary schools(Meyer et al., 2016) especially in gendered spaces like changingrooms and bathrooms (Kosciw et al., 2016, 2018). In a 2017 USsurvey of over 5,000 trans adolescents, only 16% reported thatthey always feel safe at school (Human Rights Campaign, 2018).A hostile school climate can have extensive consequencesfor trans pupils’ ability to thrive (Greytak et al., 2009). Transpupils experiencing harassment and transphobia are less likelyto be able to concentrate in class (Robinson et al., 2014), havelower educational aspirations and poorer educational attainment(Greytak et al., 2009; Kosciw et al., 2012; Robinson et al.,2014; Fayles, 2018). Trans pupils report hiding at lunch times,avoiding gendered spaces like bathrooms and changing rooms(Jones and Hillier, 2013; Robinson et al., 2014), and notparticipating in extra-curricular events and activities due tolack of safety (Jones and Hillier, 2013; Kosciw et al., 2016).Trans youth have high levels of school absenteeism due toharassment (Greytak et al., 2009, 2013; Taylor and Peter, 2011;Kosciw et al., 2012, 2016; Robinson et al., 2014). Lack ofaffirmative or safe school environments is also associated withtrans pupils dropping out of education or transferring schools(McGuire et al., 2010; O’Flynn, 2016).In-school victimization and harassment are known to havesignificant psychological and social consequences (Poteat andEspelage, 2007), including negatively affecting psychologicalwell-being (Kosciw et al., 2012), and contributing to highlevels of depression, self-harm, and suicidal ideation (Jonesand Hillier, 2013). In a 2017 UK survey of around 500 transpupils aged 11–19, 45% reported that they had attempted totake their own life, and 84% reported self-harm (Bradlow et al.,2017). A negative school climate (combined with wider systemicoppression), leaves trans pupils with low levels of optimism abouttheir chances of future success and happiness (Human RightsCampaign, 2014).Environmental Stress and CisnormativityCisnormative school climates place trans pupils under persistentpsychological stress (Ullman, 2015b; Miller, 2016c; McBride,2020). Institutionalised cisnormativity (Bauer et al., 2009)negatively affects trans pupils, delegitimising their identities andmaking their lives harder in multiple and systemic ways (Miller,2016c; McBride, 2020). Trans pupils experience persistentmicroaggressions which they recognize as symptoms of deeplyembedded structural inequality and violence (Woolley, 2017), yetschools are likely to view them as individual isolated acts. Schoolsmay already be aware of overt, individualised, intentional acts oftransphobia or violence, but they need to also be aware of thecompounding effects of subtler acts of cisnormativity, includingsystemic practices that are not intended to cause harm to transpupils (Riggs and Bartholomaeus, 2018). Beyond physical safety,trans pupils need to feel emotionally safe and welcome in school(Brill and Pepper, 2008). In the words of one parent of a youngprimary school aged trans child (Slesaransky-Poe et al., 2013, 30):“I needed to know if he would be physically and emotionally safe;feel welcomed, respected, and fully embraced; and be able to focuson learning.”A persistently stressful and hostile school climate can makeschool about survival rather than success and fulfilment(Miller, 2016c), with environmental stressors detrimentallyaffecting educational achievement and well-being (Ullman,2017). The educational disadvantage trans youth experience isnot individualised, but structural and systemic (McBride, 2020).Trans pupils experiencing macro and micro aggressions (Miller,2016a) are forced to develop defensive strategies (Greytak et al.,2013; Bowers et al., 2015; Ingrey, 2018; Kennedy, 2018) which areemotionally and cognitively difficult, reducing well-being and theability to learn and thrive.Areas of gender segregation can increase the stress felt bytrans pupils (Greytak et al., 2013; Kennedy, 2013; Bowers et al.,Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 4 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6753Horton Raising Ambition for Trans Children2015; Ingrey, 2018), placing them under additional surveillanceand pressure to conform (Woolley, 2017). Socially transitionedchildren who have not disclosed their gender modality—that theyare trans-carry an additional stress (McGuire et al., 2010) as theynavigate systems which assume they are cis4.Approaches that prioritise an individualised anti-bullyingdiscourse, including the UK Government’s approach (Carlile,2019), overlook the systemic nature of the challenge faced bytrans children in schools (Ansara andHegarty, 2012), and distractfrom the systemic reforms needed to ensure trans children arewelcomed as equals at school (Frohard-Dourlent, 2018; Riggs andBartholomaeus, 2018). We need to move beyond an exclusivefocus on safety, on violence and on individual bullies and victims,to understanding and dismantling the systemic operation ofcisnormativity in our schools (Payne and Smith, 2014; Miller,2016c; Frohard-Dourlent, 2018).Individual Accommodation on RequestFew schools provide trans-inclusive adaptations prior to havinga known trans pupil (Davy and Cordoba, 2019). Many schoolsonly take reactive actions to accommodate a trans pupil onrequest (Omercajic, 2015; Davy and Cordoba, 2019), oftenprompted by informed parent advocacy for their trans child(Neary and Cross, 2018; Riggs and Bartholomaeus, 2018; Davyand Cordoba, 2019). Schools often only accommodate accessto appropriate bathrooms after pupils or parents request suchaccess (Ingrey, 2018). This approach means trans pupils’ accessis to be requested, negotiated and permitted. Ingrey (2018)highlights the rights violation of requiring trans pupils to applyfor access, rather than the system proactively making transpupils welcome. Trans pupils are “subjected to an approvalprocess for a simple act of accessing a suitable washroom space;this process is humiliating, pathologising and alienating, andultimately transphobic” (Ingrey, 2018, 781).A individualised “accommodation on request” approachleaves the status quo intact, maintaining an “artificial hierarchy”(Serano, 2016, 13) where the dominant gender (Ingrey, 2018)is validated as “natural,” in the process pathologising transpupils’ gender modality (that they are trans—Ashley, 2019d)as requiring approval and exception from the “norm.” Transpupils’ right to identity and basic dignity is dependent on themsubmitting themselves to a pathologising and daunting processof justifying their needs and their identity to cis teachers orschool administrators (Ingrey, 2018). This accommodation maybe particularly hard for children who are gender fluid or non-binary (Omercajic and Martino, 2020)—though it needs to benoted that the current literature has little consideration of non-binary children (Airton and Koecher, 2019).Meyer and Leonardi (2018) conducted interviews withteachers, which found reluctance to make trans-affirmativeschool changes unless, and until, they personally knew a transpupil. This is born out in the wider literature, with numerousexamples of schools only making changes when forced todo so, when they encountered their first known trans pupils(Slesaransky-Poe et al., 2013; Mitchell et al., 2014; Baldwin,4Cisitude—the state of being cis—the antonym of transitude (Ashley, 2018)2015; McBride, 2020). These pioneer children may “shoulderan immense responsibility as singular sites of all learning andchange,” becoming “sacrificial lambs” (Meyer et al., 2016, 9),whose privacy and right to equality of education are neglectedin order for the school to commence incremental adaptation.Meyer et al. (2016, 9) discuss the “ethical dilemma of thispedagogy of exposure,” and how to prompt trans inclusive schoolchanges without a trans pupil or family being required to exposethemselves as educator of an unprepared school.Supportive parents and carers are relied upon to advocatefor their trans children (Neary, 2019), educating their children’steachers, and advising on inclusive policies and curricula(Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a). Families of trans childrencannot just presume their children will be safe and welcomed inschools, and instead need to be constantly vigilant, to protect andadvocate for their children (Hill and Menvielle, 2009; Johnsonet al., 2014; Pullen Sansfaçon et al., 2015; Rahilly, 2015; Riggsand Bartholomaeus, 2018; Neary, 2019). Parental advocacy onbehalf of trans children is an ongoing requirement, with supportfor trans inclusivity not automatically sustained or replicatedacross a school (Johnson et al., 2014; Riggs and Bartholomaeus,2018). Effective inclusion needs to be embedded in clear trans-affirmative policies and procedures (Bartholomaeus and Riggs,2017a), which are developed proactively, rather than enactedupon request (Baldwin, 2015).An individualised approach—listening to a child’s voice,hearing their needs and being guided by a child’s own individualpath—is absolutely critical to child-centred care (Whyatt-Sames,2017). Where families are supportive of their trans child, acollaborative trusting relationship between families and schoolscan help ensure an effective child-focused path to providinga friendly, welcoming school (Slesaransky-Poe et al., 2013).However, this individualised approach should not be a way ofshifting responsibility onto pupils (Frohard-Dourlent, 2018) andis not a substitute for proactive structural changes to ensuretrans children are made welcome in our schools (Omercajicand Martino, 2020). Frohard-Dourlent (2018) imagines a futurewhere trans pupils don’t need to self-advocate, because schoolsare already set up to recognise their existence.From School Panic to Affirmation andRepresentationThere is a pervasive culture of silence (Ullman, 2014; Ullmanand Ferfolja, 2015; Frohard-Dourlent, 2016); around trans livesat school that has a negative impact on trans children (Ryanet al., 2013). This culture of silence is reinforced throughmultiplemeans, from formal legislation against LGBT inclusion in school5(Carlile, 2019), to teacher self-censure (Roberts et al., 2007),through to approaches that police offensive language withoutempowering teachers to provide alternative positive narratives(DePalma and Atkinson, 2009a).A culture of silence is also promoted by cisnormativity,wherein any trans representation is perceived through a lens ofhyper-visibility (DePalma and Atkinson, 2006). Trans (and LGB)5Section 28 was a statute in place in the UK between 1988 and 2003, that bannedthe “promotion” of same-sex relationships in schools (Carlile, 2019).Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 5 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6754Horton Raising Ambition for Trans Childrenequality can be seen as controversial in a way that does not extendto other equalities (Atkinson and DePalma, 2008) with somecommentators considering children “too young” to learn abouttheir trans classmates (Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a). Thepresence and increasing visibility of trans children in primaryand nursery classrooms (Riggs and Bartholomaeus, 2018) forcesprimary school educators to face up to the silence surroundingtrans lives (Payne and Smith, 2014). Unprepared schools canenter into “school panic,” when a culture of silence comes upagainst the reality of trans children’s lives (Smith and Payne, 2016;Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a).“When marginalised groups begin to challenge society’sexpectation that they will remain invisible and silent, theyare faced with a choice between invisibility (where they havetraditionally been assumed not to exist) and surplus visibility(where their mere presence seems excessive).” (DePalma andAtkinson, 2009b, 887).Schools need to adopt a “usualising” approach to trans inclusion,where trans people are destigmatised to the point that theirvisibility is no longer of note (Iskander and Shabtay, 2018; Carlile,2019). Trans people can be made part of everyday life throughincorporation into different parts of the curriculum (Mitchellet al., 2014) moving trans lives in schools “from surplus visibilityto ordinariness” (DePalma and Atkinson, 2009b, 884).Curricula remain cis-dominated (Miller et al., 2018) with transidentities nearly invisible (Miller, 2016a). Many children do notsee any representations of trans people at school (Mitchell et al.,2014; Peter et al., 2016). Erasure of trans visibility delegitimizestrans identities (Miller, 2016c), forming a systemic macro-aggression where trans pupils need to continuously self-advocateand educate to be read as valid (Frohard-Dourlent, 2018). Whenschools do not affirm or represent trans identities, this impactson trans children’s self-image, belonging and sense of worth(Ullman, 2014; Miller, 2016a). Exclusion from the curriculumgives a message that trans identities are inferior (Miller, 2016c;Shelton, 2016). Marginalisation and exclusion at school and inwider society teaches trans pupils that there is no place for themin the school or the wider world (Ryan et al., 2013; Ullman, 2017).Affirming trans-positive school environments are vitallyimportant for trans pupils, improving mental health, well-being, self-esteem, school engagement, and sense of belonging(Olson, 2016; Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a; Day et al.,2018). Children who are affirmed at home and at schoolhave positive academic and emotional outcomes (Davy andCordoba, 2019). Miller (2016a, 6) highlights the importanceof schools being affirming with a “pedagogy of recognition”where trans pupils can see that they are valued, not merelytolerated. Trans representation can also have huge importancefor gender questioning children, with access to the word trans,and knowledge of the existence of trans identities opening doorsto self-discovery (Kennedy, 2018). Most pupils do not see anytrans representation in schools (Bradlow et al., 2017), and therepresentation that does exists is mostly negative, framing transpeople as “at risk” (Bittner et al., 2016). In these contexts transpupils can gain confidence and self-esteem from any positivetrans representation (Snapp et al., 2015).An inclusive curriculum explicitly tackles the misconceptionsthat underpin transphobia (Meyer et al., 2016) and reinforcespeer acceptance (Kosciw et al., 2012; Ryan et al., 2013), withincreased peer support creating a more positive school climatefor trans pupils (Kosciw et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2016). Transrepresentation in the classroom sends pupils a message thatteachers support them, that they have a right to be safe in school(Kosciw et al., 2012; Peter et al., 2016), that they are not alone(Miller et al., 2018). A trans-affirmative curricula builds a moresupportive, welcoming school climate (Peter et al., 2016; Martinoand Cumming-Potvin, 2017), and improves well-being of transpupils (Greytak et al., 2013; Kahn and Lindstrom, 2015).Trans pupils who feel able to fully participate as an equal inschool, being open, when they choose, about their identity andbeing able to discuss “transitude” (Ashley, 2018, 4) at school, hada greater sense of belonging (Greytak et al., 2009). Trans pupilshaving a sense of belonging at school correlates to pupil well-being, academic motivation and academic achievement (Kosciwet al., 2012; Ullman, 2015b).Trans inclusion is needed in education about bodies andpuberty (Jones et al., 2016), though with care not to limitinclusion to Relationships and Sex Education, which can bepathologising (Formby, 2015; Carlile, 2019). Trans positiverepresentation in literature provides a “pedagogy of possibility”(Bittner et al., 2016, 2) that disrupts cisnormativity (Cumming-Potvin and Martino, 2018) showing trans people “as part ofvibrant, supportive communities, living fulfilling, and productivelives” (Parsons, 2016, 11). Trans representation in history,showing historic fights for rights and visibility, helps validate andgive hope to trans pupils, whilst also raising acceptance from cispeers (Snapp et al., 2015).Teacher Barriers to ActionTrans pupils can experience bullying, transphobia, ignoranceand hostility from teachers and school staff (Reed et al., 2010;Taylor and Peter, 2011; Kuvalanka et al., 2014; Formby, 2015;Bartholomaeus et al., 2017), causing significant harm (Robinsonet al., 2014). Teachers can also contribute to a hostile climatethrough inaction when pupils are facing transphobic harassment(Greytak et al., 2009; McGuire et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2014;Bowers et al., 2015; Ullman, 2015b, 2017; Kosciw and Pizmony-Levy, 2016). Trans pupils who do not feel supported by theirteachers are more than four times as likely to leave school if theyencounter discrimination (Jones et al., 2016), with teacher failureto intervene seen as a violation of trust (Meyer and Stader, 2009).Teachers have enormous power to “affirm or belittle theexistence of youth in their classrooms” (Kearns et al., 2017,12). Some teachers and school administrators are positive, well-informed and affirmative, and even just one supportive andtrusted teacher can make a profound impact on a trans pupil’sexperience of school (McGuire et al., 2010; Mulcahy et al.,2016; Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a; Ullman, 2017; Palkkiand Caldwell, 2018). In schools where teachers were protectiveand affirming (Meyer et al., 2016), consistently intervening todisrupt marginalising behaviour, pupils experienced lower ratesof bullying (Greytak et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2016), had lowerrates of school absenteeism (Ullman, 2015b; Jones et al., 2016),Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 6 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6755Horton Raising Ambition for Trans Childrenand higher rates of happiness and self-esteem (Kosciw et al., 2013;Ullman, 2015b). Perceived acceptance from teachers matters asmuch as protection (Ullman, 2014), with teacher positivity aboutgender diversity significantly correlated with pupil well-being(Ullman, 2015b, 2017). Trans pupils spoke of the importance ofhaving at least one adult who could advocate for them, help themunderstand their rights, and help them navigate cisnormativeinstitutional cultures and regimes (McGuire et al., 2010).A key barrier to trans inclusion is teacher willingness, withsome staff not believing it is their job to include or affirmtrans youth (Meyer and Leonardi, 2018), or having “barriers toempathy” (Blair and Deckman, 2019, 2). Bowers et al. (2015)notes that school staff will be shaped by negative attitudes,misinformation or transphobia endemic in society. Teachers whowere willing to refer to LGB identities in their classroom wereless willing to include trans people (Formby, 2015), consideringthe topic taboo (Pullen Sansfaçon et al., 2015), too complex(Mitchell et al., 2014), or too difficult (Cumming-Potvin andMartino, 2018). However, once teachers tried trans and LGBinclusiveness, they were surprised to find children capable ofengaging sensitively and thoughtfully (Carlile, 2019). School staffcan be overwhelmed by inertia, aware of the need to supporttrans pupils, but holding on to pre-established prejudices oftrans as an undesirable “deviation” (Frohard-Dourlent, 2018).Teachers and school administrators may wrongly assume theexistence of transphobic institutional and legal regulations wherediscriminatory regulations do not exist (Frohard-Dourlent,2016).Teacher lack of knowledge remains a barrier (PullenSansfaçon et al., 2015; Bartholomaeus et al., 2017; Carlile, 2019).Ill-informed teachers can do harm, by relying on stereotypesthat reinforce prejudice (Mitchell et al., 2014). Teachers mayalso experience fear and anxiety at the presence of transchildren in their classroom (Payne and Smith, 2014; Smithand Payne, 2016; Blair and Deckman, 2019), the arrival ofa trans child forcing teachers to become aware of (but notnecessarily challenge) cisnormative assumptions and practices.Teachers lacked confidence in how to identify school practicesthat harm trans pupils, or in how to identify transphobic orcisnormative stereotypes, bias or prejudice in teaching materials(Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a). Teachers preferred to focuson “the problem” of fitting trans pupils into a cisnormativeschool, prioritising individualised actions like name change,rather than considering wider trans-inclusive adaptations (Smithand Payne, 2016).Teachers and school staff who have undertaken specifictraining on working with trans pupils, and those with transfriends or family, had more positive attitudes and greaterconfidence in working with trans pupils, and were morelikely to advocate for their trans pupils (Bowers et al., 2015;Bartholomaeus et al., 2017). Staff who had knowingly taughtat least one trans pupil had more positive attitudes on transinclusion (Bowers et al., 2015; Bartholomaeus et al., 2017),building confidence with experience (Davy and Cordoba, 2019),However, a majority had not knowingly taught a trans pupil(Bowers et al., 2015). Mentorship arrangements between staffwith prior experience and staff who are new to this werefound helpful in raising confidence, though such support israre, especially in primary schools (Slesaransky-Poe et al., 2013;Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a; Davy and Cordoba, 2019).Another barrier was teacher concern about wider communityor parental opposition to support for trans pupils. Teacherswere likely to assume parents as a whole would disapproveof LGBT inclusion (Depalma and Atkinson, 2010) and usedthis as justification for not acknowledging gender diversity intheir teaching. Without school-set expectations, some teacherswere likely to focus on the perceived preferences of trans-antagonistic parents, rather than centring the needs of transchildren (Malins, 2016).Teacher fear, underpinned by the impacts of anti-transand anti-LGBT legislation, is a significant obstacle (Carlile,2019), with teachers feeling they needed courage to deliverLGBT inclusive curricula (Atkinson and DePalma, 2008; Carlile,2019). Teachers avoided the topic (DePalma and Atkinson,2006; Cumming-Potvin and Martino, 2018), believing theyneeded explicit permission to talk about it (DePalma andAtkinson, 2009a). Teachers need a network of support to enableand encourage trans inclusivity (Malins, 2016). DePalma andAtkinson (2009a) emphasizes how teachers aiming for LGBTschool equality may need extra cross-school support, as they canfeel isolated and worry about being perceived as “subversive.”In locations like the UK, with a history of LGBT-exclusionaryschool legislation, proactive policy, and school-wide efforts areneeded to ensure teachers gain confidence that trans inclusion isnot controversial or unusual, but essential and routine (Mitchellet al., 2014). Similar efforts are needed when schools come underthe pressure of conservative campaigns against trans-inclusionin education, campaigns that put pressure on schools in manycountries to overlook their responsibility toward trans pupils(Jones et al., 2016; Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a).Reference to legal mandates and government or educationalguidance is an important support for teachers and schooladministrators, making the connection to obligations to provideequality of opportunity safety, and physical and emotional well-being for all children (DePalma and Atkinson, 2009a; Mitchellet al., 2014; Carlile, 2019). Leadership, policies and guidelinesfrom national or sub-national government are particularlyhelpful to ensuring school commitment (Bartholomaeus andRiggs, 2017b). Governments need to fulfil their responsibilitiesin providing clear legislation and guidance to uphold the rightsof trans children in education (Riley, 2012). Unfortunately,governments are frequently slow on delivering this leadership(Riley, 2012; Neary and Cross, 2018), failing in their duty of carefor trans children.Martino and Cumming-Potvin (2018) reference the ways inwhich teacher action or inaction in support of trans pupils isinfluenced as much by media landscape as by formal policy, orthe ways equality-related policies are framed and understoodthrough media narratives. In contexts where national policy ormedia landscape is hostile to trans pupils, schools, and teachershaving an ethical commitment to caring for their trans pupilsbecomes even more important (Miller et al., 2018). Leadershipand support at school level are critical for teacher action (Malins,2016). Class teachers look for assurance that they have their headFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 7 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6756Horton Raising Ambition for Trans Childrenteacher’s backing (Mitchell et al., 2014). In many schools, headteachers (principals) are proactively working to ensure equalityof opportunity for trans pupils (Meyer et al., 2016). Equalitymotivated school board members can play a critical role inensuring teachers and school leadership have a clear mandateto support their trans pupils, ensuring teachers understand andtackle cisnormativity, providing a welcoming school (Meyeret al., 2016).Ambition and AlliesThe literature challenges the ambition we should have for trans-inclusivity in our schools, shifting from a focus on protectionto school environments that affirm, validate, and welcome transpupils as equals (Case and Meier, 2014; Snapp et al., 2015;Meyer and Leonardi, 2018; Sinclair-Palm and Gilbert, 2018); Theliterature emphasises the importance of teacher allies (Meyeret al., 2016) and the need to raise our imagination of whatteachers and school administrators are able to do to supporttheir trans pupils (Atkinson and DePalma, 2008; Frohard-Dourlent, 2016). Our ambition for teacher allies needs to movebeyond protection of an individual pupil, to being willing todismantle cisnormative structures, policies, and approaches thatdelegitimise and marginalise trans pupils (Case and Meier, 2014;Meyer et al., 2016; Peter et al., 2016; Marx et al., 2017; Meyer andLeonardi, 2018).The systemic inequalities experienced by trans pupilsrepresent a significant human rights issue (Greytak et al.,2009; Ullman, 2014; Martino and Cumming-Potvin, 2016),necessitating a shift from trans inclusion to trans emancipationin our schools (Mayo, 2007). Where there is a systemic injustice,as is the case for trans pupils in schools today, allies have aresponsibility to act as advocates for social justice (Gonzalezand McNulty, 2010; Kearns et al., 2017). As well as mentoringand supporting empowerment of individual trans pupils toassert their rights, teacher allies can ensure there is clearcommunication across the school on trans equality, sponsorLGBT groups, educate school staff, and advocate for pupils’ rightsand well-being across the school and beyond the school gate(Gonzalez and McNulty, 2010; Case and Meier, 2014).Teacher education and training needs to move beyond basiceducation on the existence of trans people and on transphobicbullying (Meyer and Stader, 2009; Parsons, 2016; Bartholomaeusand Riggs, 2017a). Trans pupils wanted teacher training to helpensure staff take action to tackle cisnormativity in educationalsystems and classrooms, improving equality of opportunity fortrans pupils (McGuire et al., 2010; Frohard-Dourlent, 2018).Trans pupils often have a good understanding of the structuralfactors underpinning the challenges they face in school, andwanted school staff to acknowledge and be proactive in tacklingthese systemic barriers (McGuire et al., 2010). Training needsto help school staff understand the ways in which schoolcisnormativity marginalises trans pupils (McGuire et al., 2010),positioning trans pupils as lesser or other (Miller, 2016c; Marxet al., 2017). Trans pupils also wanted school educators to bemore active in speaking up for trans rights in external processesand policy fora, helping them overcome areas of structuraloppression that impede their access to justice and equality ineducation and beyond (McGuire et al., 2010).Bartholomaeus and Riggs (2017a) highlight the manyexamples of cisgender teachers and school administrators whoare already effectively advocating for, and standing up with, transpupils in schools (Ryan et al., 2013; Martino and Cumming-Potvin, 2017). Feeling safe at school needs to be recognised asthe bare minimum to expect for our trans children (Ullman,2015a) with educators needing to go further and ensure schoolsare inclusive and affirming (Bartholomaeus and Riggs, 2017a)places where trans pupils belong, where they are loved, wherethey succeed and thrive (McGuire et al., 2010; Miller et al.,2018). Miller (2016b) aspires to a future where trans pupils arecommonplace and normalised, where gender diversity does notlead to macroaggressions or marginalization, where there is transrepresentation across all school materials and curricula, whereschools support and embrace trans pupils of all ages.Child Voice and Child RightsA child-rights informed approach centres trans children’s right toan educational experience that is safe, inclusive and affirming, aright to “gender legibility” (Miller, 2016c, 34), in schools wherethey can have an equitable experience to their cis classmates.Trans children have a right to privacy, to gender marker change,and a right to choose if, and how, and when, to disclose theirgender modality (that they are trans) (McGuire et al., 2010).Trans children also have a right to be visible in schools, openabout their transitude to their classmates and school. Riggs andBartholomaeus (2018) provide an example of a parent feelingtheir child and family had been pushed toward not disclosingtheir transitude, to simplify the situation for the school and otherparents, rather than centring the needs and rights of the child.There remain incidences where trans children’s existing legalrights are not respected and where schools fail in their legal dutytoward trans children (Taylor and Peter, 2011; Ingrey, 2018).In countries where trans children have legal protection, schoolsneed to ensure administrators, teachers and pupils are awareof these rights, and mechanisms need to be in place to holdschools accountable when these are not fulfilled (Schindel, 2008).Schools also have a responsibility to advocate for trans children’sneeds and rights, including through educating unsupportive orunenlightened parents (Grossman et al., 2009). Trans childrenand supportive parents need to know their rights in order toclaim them (Davy and Cordoba, 2019), and in order to challengewhere there is ongoing inequality and injustice (Schindel, 2008).Meyer and Keenan (2018) outline the limitations of legallymandated protection of trans children, arguing that beyond anindividual trans child’s rights, there must be a focus on a school’sresponsibilities, ensuring there is institutional accountability forsystemic change.LGBTQ clubs (GSA in North America) can provide transchildren with peer support in an affirming and safe space, andan escape from ignorance and cisnormativity (McGuire et al.,2010; Taylor and Peter, 2011; Kosciw et al., 2012, 2016; Marx andKettrey, 2016). Trans youth with access to a GSA report morewelcoming school climates, lower rates of victimization, greaterfeelings of school connectedness, and less school absenteeism(Greytak et al., 2013). GSA members report a greater sense ofempowerment (Poteat et al., 2016), can come together to jointlychallenge systemic injustice and advocate for changes at schoolFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 8 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6757Horton Raising Ambition for Trans Children(Greytak et al., 2009; Gonzalez and McNulty, 2010), increasinglyprioritising trans related advocacy (Poteat et al., 2018). Transpupils who feel empowered and know their rights, who framedthe discrimination they endure as related to societal and systemicprejudice, were more likely to respond with activism, and morelikely to feel optimistic about being able to contribute to socialchange (Jones and Hillier, 2013; Jones et al., 2016). Luecke (2018)discusses components of a “Gender Facilitative School,” withan emphasis on empowering all children to be advocates andsupporters of their gender expansive peers.Many studies note the resilience of trans pupils, theiragency to resist injustices and advocate for themselves andtheir peers (McBride, 2020). Wernick et al. (2014) emphasisethat marginalised youth need to identify and drive theirown solutions, including through educating peers to jointhem in collective action. Kjaran and Jóhannesson (2013)highlight the importance of an emancipatory approach thatprioritises listening to trans pupils’ stories, including theirexperiences of encountering and resisting cisnormativity andstructural violence. However, minority youth cannot be left tosingle-handedly challenge ingrained and dominant systems ofcisnormativity, and the institutional and systemic discriminationthat affects their lives (McBride, 2020).REVIEW OF UK TRANS-INCLUSIONSCHOOL GUIDANCE DOCUMENTSThis section summarises an analysis of a sample of recent UKschool guidance documents, examining the degree to whichthemes, findings and recommendations from global literatureare represented. It reviews the eight themes from the globalliterature, finding varied representation of these themes in UKschool guidance documents.Varied Commitment to Depathologisationand Trans-positivityMany of the guidance documents contained instances ofpathologisation of trans children. Four types of pathologisationwere noted: delegitimisation, problematisation, medicalization,and deficit framing. Guidelines on trans inclusion need a strongercommitment to avoiding pathologisation of trans children withintheir text, alongside working toward depathologisation of transidentities across our schools.Across the guides there are a number of examples wherelanguage and phrasing others and pathologises trans children.There are examples of misgendering with Education AuthorityNorthern Ireland (2019, 11) describing trans feminine childrenas “birth assigned males.” Education Authority Northern Ireland(2019) delegitimises younger trans children, referencing an olderresearch study on desistance6, that has been heavily criticisedby modern research literature as flawed and pathologising(Ehrensaft et al., 2018; Newhook et al., 2018b; Turban andKeuroghlian, 2018). A number of the guides completely avoid theterm “trans children” in a way that marginalises and delegitimises6Itself a problematic and pathologising concept (Newhook et al., 2018a).younger trans children, for example talking of children who“want to live in a different gender” LGBT Youth Scotland(2017, 10), using the phrase “trans young people” throughout(Equaliteach, 2020) or “childrenwho are questioning their genderidentity” (Stonewall, 2018, 12). Each of these phrases has a place,as long as it is alongside and not instead of acknowledgmentof the existence of trans children. Other guides including LeedsCity Council (2018), Brighton and Hove City Council (2019)and the Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019), confidently use theterm “trans children,” an important step in combatting erasure,stigmatisation and pathologisation. Brighton and Hove CityCouncil (2019) normalises the term trans children across itsguide, stating that many trans people are aware of their identitiesat (or before) primary school. The Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019)outlines the importance of affirming trans children.There are a number of examples where guides problematizetrans children. Education Authority Northern Ireland (2019,7) has a section “We do not know exactly why people aretransgender,” without asking why people are cisgender, aninherently othering frame. Brighton and Hove City Council(2019, 7) is clear on the need to avoid problematisation of transpupils: “Avoid seeing the trans or gender-questioning child oryoung person as a problem and instead see an opportunity toenrich the school community.” There are a number of areasin which trans children are medicalised and pathologised, withEducation Authority Northern Ireland (2019, 8,37) makingreference to a “clinical condition,” and the suggestion that“medical advice may be sought” when responding to youngerchildren. EANI adopts a pathologising and medicalising framingto social transition, whereas the Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019)has a depathologised and demedicalised section on socialtransition, making clear it is not linked to medical services.Many of the guides frame trans children as inherently at riskand in need of protection, devoting significant space to statisticson bullying, abuse, school drop-out and suicidality amongst transpupils. Some guides make clear that these negative outcomes arenot intrinsic to being trans—Brighton and Hove City Council(2019, 11) states: “many of these problems are not caused bybeing trans but by society’s attitude toward people who are trans.”The Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019, 12) makes clear that riskfactors for mental health are “a result of unsupportive socialcontexts and responses that they encounter due to prejudice andlack of understanding.” LGBT Youth Scotland (2017) emphasisesthe pathologisation that underlies much parental rejection oftrans children, arguing that schools have an important role toplay in depathologising trans identities.Strong on Transphobic Bullying—Varied onProtection From DiscriminationBasic guidance on avoiding illegal discrimination is prioritised inmany of the school guidance documents, outlining the school’sobligations to allow name changes or access to appropriatelygendered bathrooms, with many making a connection torelevant legislation including the 2010 Equality Act: “so transgirls because they are girls, can use the girls’ toilets” (TransInclusion Toolkit, 2019, 25). The guides vary in how clearly theyFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 9 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6758Horton Raising Ambition for Trans Childrenprioritise protecting trans pupils from discrimination, especiallyin situations where others want to exclude or segregate them.LGBT Youth Scotland (2017, 18) prioritises protecting transchildren from discrimination: “If a learner feels uncomfortablesharing facilities with a transgender young person, they can beallowed to use a private facility such as an accessible toilet, or toget changed after the trans young person is done. A transgenderyoung person should not be forced to use alternative facilitiessimply to make other young people feel more comfortable.”Conversely, Education Authority Northern Ireland (2019, 34)does not fully support trans pupils, suggesting staff need toconsider “the needs of other pupils.” Education AuthorityNorthern Ireland (2019) also suggests that a trans pupil’s ownsafety can be a reason to deny them access to their preferredfacilities, penalising a pupil for their school’s failure to keep themsafe. This can be contrasted with guidance from LGBT YouthScotland (2017, 21) which is clear that “risk assessments shouldnot be used to exclude a transgender young person.”Many of the guides focus heavily on bullying—in fact severalof the sampled guides are specifically on HBT (Homophobic,biphobic, transphobic) bullying. There has been a significantUK investment in work to tackle HBT bullying, including pilotinitiatives and an evaluation of the effectiveness of differentapproaches to HBT bullying (Case and Meier, 2014; Mitchellet al., 2016). There needs to be awareness that HBT guides maynot go beyond this topic, into other areas which are critical fortrans inclusion and trans equality.All of the guides discuss transphobic bullying, particularlyin terms of intentional transphobia and a focus on a single,peer, bully to victim dynamic. Several guides commit topolicing abusive language, though do not prioritise action toaddress underlying views or education to replace transphobicframes with trans-positive ones. The Trans Inclusion Toolkit(2019) meanwhile emphasizes the need to explore and explainwhen pupils ask inappropriate questions or use transphobiclanguage. Many of the guides associate transphobia with extremeovertly abusive language. The Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019)on the other hand centres the voices of trans children, whoshare their experiences of subtler harassment, providing anannex of trans children sharing examples of inappropriate andinvalidating questions.Minimal Consideration of CisnormativityThe school guidance documents have minimal consideration ofcisnormativity, or the ways in which persistent cisnormativitymanifests as continuous microaggressions, making trans childrenstressed, unwelcome and emotionally unsafe at school.A wide number of the guides do not even mention the termcisnormativity (Brighton and Hove City Council, 2019; TransInclusion Toolkit, 2019; Stonewall, 2020), and whilst others(Equaliteach, 2020) provide a definition, they do not devotespace to unpacking how cisnormativity affects trans children’swell-being at school.Overall, the guides give very limited consideration to thesystemic changes which are needed to make trans childrenwelcome in our schools. Most of the guidance documentsconsider the support needed at the point of a pupil’s socialtransition, but appear unaware of ongoing adaptations that transpupils may need to tackle institutional cisnormativity (Stonewall,2020). Brighton and Hove City Council (2019) mentions thattrans inclusion requires a whole school and community toshift their thinking and understanding, but does not considerimplications in terms of shifts in behaviour or systems. Leeds CityCouncil (2018) mentions the need to build trans youth resilience,without considering school responsibilities to ensure trans youthare not living under stress and discrimination.Many of the guides, particularly for primary schools (LeedsCity Council, 2018), do talk about systemic change whendiscussing the need to challenge gender stereotypes, includingthe reduction of gendered restrictions and practices. Althoughthis work is useful to all pupils trans and cis, there needs to berecognition that work on gender stereotypes alone is insufficientto overcome the structural cisnormativity that can make schoolsa hostile environment for trans children.Reactive Rather Than Proactive Approachto Trans InclusionMany guides place an important emphasis on listening to eachindividual child, hearing and understanding their individualneeds and preferences. However, most of the guides do notmention the burden an individualised and reactive approachplaces on the shoulders of trans children. LGBT Youth Scotland(2017) refers to the extent trans pupils have to self-advocatethroughout their time in education and the Trans InclusionToolkit includes a quote from a trans pupil illustrating the burdenwhen they are forced to educate an unprepared school.Few of the guides explicitly talk about trans children’s rightsat school. Stonewall (2020) gives a transition check-list thatdoes not mention explaining to a trans pupil their rights.Education Authority Northern Ireland (2019) particularly failsto centre child rights in suggesting a school’s commitment totrans inclusive adaptations will depend on a school’s ethos andfinancial resources. Education Authority Northern Ireland (2019,19) also fails to centre a child’s right to an affirming name orpronoun, framing decisions on pronoun change as a “significantchange” to be decided by the school rather than the individualpupil. LGBT Youth Scotland (2017, 28) puts each young transperson at the centre “Ask the young person how they would likeyou and the school to support them.” Without first explaining toa trans child their rights, they may not be aware of how manyaccommodations they can ask for, especially given the powerdynamics at play between cis adults and trans children.Many of the guides suggest trans inclusion starts at the point ofa school knowingly having a pupil ask about transition. The Transinclusion toolkit emphasises that schools need to provide a transinclusive environment regardless of whether they knowingly havetrans pupils, considering children who have not yet transitioned,as well as pupils who have already transitioned but not disclosedtheir gender modality. Many of the guides expect trans pupilsto make individualised requests before accessing appropriatefacilities and expect trans pupils to submit to a review processbefore gaining permission (National Education Union, 2018;Brighton and Hove City Council, 2019; Trans Inclusion Toolkit,Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 10 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6759Horton Raising Ambition for Trans Children2019). The guides do not outline the importance of ensuringtrans pupils know their rights, or the importance of proactivelycommunicating trans inclusive policies to the school community.Brighton and Hove City Council (2019, 7) is clear that transpupils should not be made to feel like they are privileged forgetting basic accommodations “No trans pupil or student shouldbe made to feel that they are the ones who are causing problemsor that they owe anything to their school in return for changesmade to support them.”Many of the guides talk about individualised discussions forschool and curricular adaptation to an individual pupil—forexample Brighton and Hove City Council (2019) talks positivelyabout working with a parent to adapt a lesson on reproductionto ensure it was trans inclusive. There is no consideration ofhow to ensure adaptations are embedded and sustained, noconsideration of the pressure this places on individual pupilsor families at a time when pupils and families may be unclearon their rights, and no consideration of the inefficiencies ofeach trans child negotiating individualised solutions rather thanlearning from existing good practices. The Trans InclusionToolkit (2019, 6) makes reference to the burden shouldered bytrans pupils tasked with negotiating their own trans-inclusiveadaptation—one child expressed hope that the trans inclusiontoolkit “will take the responsibility for educating people off me.”Moderate Emphasis on Inclusion andRepresentationStonewall (2020) and LGBT Youth Scotland (2017) are strongon arguing that an absence of trans representation in ourschools sends a negative message, whereas a trans inclusivecurriculum embeds positive messages about trans people intoregular teaching, normalising trans people as a usual and valuedpart of our communities. LGBT Youth Scotland (2017, 32) makesclear the case for representation: “Transgender young peopletypically wait 4 years before talking to someone about theirgender identity. During that time, they may not see or hearanything about transgender people, identities or topics at school.”They also include a quote from a trans pupil “Definitely thereneeds to be more transgender inclusion in education—we didn’teven get a single mention of being trans at my school” (LGBTYouth Scotland, 2017, 32).The suggested examples of trans inclusion can be limited,with some LGBT guidance documents failing to mention transexamples (Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, 2018). Stonewall (2019)includes a number of examples, but further consideration couldbe made on how to ensure teachers conduct discussions in a waythat affirms trans pupils. Brighton and Hove City Council (2019)commits to inclusive SRE including in teaching on body parts andpuberty—ensuring this is validating both for trans pupils and inthe impression conveyed to their cis peers.There is a suggestion across numerous guides that early yearsand primary work on gender stereotypes equals support for transstudents. All pupils will benefit from work on gender stereotypes,but younger trans pupils, who may or may not be gender non-conforming (Olson and Enright, 2018), need additional areasof action. The Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019, 17) is very clearon the point at which trans inclusion is appropriate: “Theappropriate age to discuss the existence of trans and LGB peopleis the same time it is appropriate to talk about the existence ofheterosexual relationships and the existence of boys and girls.”This can be contrasted to Education Authority Northern Ireland(2019) which talks about age appropriateness, controversy, andrecommends inclusion at secondary school—age 11+.LGBT Youth Scotland (2019) recommends talking about transprofessionals in light of their professional achievements andcommenting in passing at the end of a lesson that they are trans,normalising trans people and demonstrating inclusion in action.Varied Attention to Teacher BarriersTrans Inclusion Toolkit (2019) mentions that school staff candeliberately misgender trans pupils, and are clear that this is aserious concern, an act of harmful behaviour toward a child; aswell as highlighting how teachers can inadvertently cause harmthrough inappropriate questions. Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019)explains that poor relationships with teachers can be a risk factorfor trans children experiencing poor mental health. LGBT YouthScotland (2019) provides an example scenario and recommendedactions if a teacher is deliberately using the wrong pronoun.Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019, 6) also highlights a trans childexplaining where teachers can make a difference “If one personin school asks the right questions, uses the right name and theright pronouns it can make such a huge difference to a youngperson. It can help them carry on and live another day.” LGBTYouth Scotland (2019, 9) “expects all teachers to be positive rolemodels to all young people in showing respect to transgenderyoung people.”Trans inclusion toolkit ends with an annex of trans childquotes which really highlight the impact when schools fail intheir duty of care to trans children, including the ways in whichimpacts on mental health and self-esteem are undervalued: “Idon’t drink all day at school so that I don’t have to go to the toiletwhich means I’m always dehydrated and I get headaches all thetime and UTIs. Teachers need to know this because it’s easy toignore all the consequences when it’s just our mental health butwhen it’s physical they suddenly listen.”Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019) mentions importance oftraining to ensure “all teachers feel confident to support transchildren.” Brighton and Hove City Council (2019) providesscripts for potential difficult questions from wider parents, butdoes not examine the prejudices, fears or misconceptions thatmay impede teachers from being supportive.Very few of the guides explicitly identify and addressbarriers that may impede teachers from effectively including andaffirming trans pupils. LGBT Youth Scotland (2019) simply statesthat if staff are reluctant they should be reminded of their duty ofcare to all learners. The Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019, 6) alludesto teacher related challenges in a quote from a trans child “Thistoolkit will help people who are scared and sadly, all too often,unwilling to do the right thing.”Equaliteach (2020) dedicates space to identifying andaddressing barriers to teachers creating affirming schools,including ensuring support for younger trans children.Equaliteach (2020) considers mandate, leadership, governance,staff support, working groups and efforts to institutionalise andsustain change.Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 11 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6760Horton Raising Ambition for Trans ChildrenLow Expectations for Allies and OutcomesThe documents presented a fairly low bar on teacher and staffexpectations, with ambitions framed primarily in terms of beinga supportive listener and intervening in transphobic bullying.There was little discussion of practical steps teacher allies can taketo disrupt cisnormativity, to reduce the stress carried by transpupils navigating a cisnormative world.Equaliteach (2020) framed teacher allies as people who wouldchallenge a HBT incident, who are aware of their legal dutiesand who understand basic trans related terminology. The level ofambition in LGBT Youth Scotland (2017) in terms of standing upfor trans children in primary schools is also very low, prioritisingavoidance of gender stereotypes. Stonewall (2020) is a documenton next steps in LGBT inclusion, but it is still very basic inits ambition on trans affirmative education. It largely focuseson gender stereotypes, on the fact trans people exist and onsupporting pupils who transition to access their legal minimumrights, without commitment to more systemic change.Brighton and Hove City Council (2019, 6) sets its ambitionhigher on “developing whole school policy and practice that willallow trans children and young people to achieve at school.”However, the included parent case studies imply satisfactionat basic accommodations of trans children in schools, givingan impression that a school not discriminating against transpupils is a success. One case study written in a partiallypositive way included examples of significant school failure—a child never going to the toilet at school—suggesting lowparental expectations.Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019, 13) calls for higher ambition,emphasising that poor outcomes are not intrinsic to being transand that schools have a crucial responsibility: “It is vital thatschools and education settings don’t present negative outcomesas expected futures to children and families. Staff should workto mitigate risk, safeguard children and families and support thedevelopment of positive outcomes.”Varied Commitment to Child Voice andChild RightsThe school guidance documents vary in how effectively theycentre trans children’s rights, and in howmuch they listen to transchildren’s voices, experience, concerns, and priorities.The guides vary in their commitment to child rights. Severalguides reference the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child(Trans Inclusion Toolkit, 2019), outlining that trans pupils“should be involved in all decisions affecting them, understandany action which is taken and why; and be at the centre of anydecisionmaking” (LGBT Youth Scotland, 2017, 8). Several guidesreference trans children’s right to privacy (Brighton and HoveCity Council, 2019; Trans Inclusion Toolkit, 2019), and theirright to an education free from discrimination and prejudice(LGBT Youth Scotland, 2017). Brighton and Hove City Council(2019) states categorically that trans children have the right toaccess correct facilities, though in one section appears to qualifythis right: “As far as possible, trans pupils and students should beable to sleep in dorms appropriate to their gender identity.”The degree to which guides centre child rights is centralto their approach to social transition. Education AuthorityNorthern Ireland (2019, 19) describes their approach as informedby a child rights based approach, yet balances a trans child’s wishto transition with “the need to protect the child from the negativereaction of others.” Decision making around transition is thusput in the hands of adult staff—likely to be cis. A genuinelychild-centred approach is found in LGBT Youth Scotland (2017),which is clear that decision making on transition timelines is inthe hands of the trans pupil, stating that “delaying a transgenderyoung person’s wish to transition could negatively affect theirmental health.” Brighton and Hove City Council (2019) and theTrans Inclusion Toolkit (2019) both emphasise that a school’sduty when working with parents or guardians is to represent theinterests of the child, to ensure the child’s voice is heard and to betheir advocate.The guides vary in how much they centre trans children’svoices, with the Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019) strong onincluding trans children’s quotes throughout. Brighton and HoveCity Council (2019) is a third edition that has been developedand informed by “the voice of trans children, young people,adults and their parents and carers.” In terms of giving platformsfor trans children to share their experiences, Stonewall (2020)includes an example of a secondary school where confident transpupils are invited to give assemblies to all students on theirexperiences and how others can help. However, the examplefrom a primary school is just on gender stereotypes, leading toa question on whether there is prioritisation on hearing the voiceof younger trans pupils.Many of the guides explicitly prioritise asking pupils priorto a social transition their views on their needs and preferencesin terms of their individual transition. There is not a similarcommitment to asking trans pupils who have already transitionedto share their views on systemic changes that would makethe school better for themselves and current and future transpupils. Education Authority Northern Ireland (2019) however,did include examples of gaining the views of trans pupils throughmeetings with the deputy head and through a confidential survey.The Trans Inclusion Toolkit (2019) has a trans inclusionchecklist for a school to self-complete, likely from the perspectiveof cis teachers or school administrators who do not directlyexperience the challenges that trans pupils face in a cisnormativeschool. It would bemore ambitious if schools sought a trans pupilperspective on whether the school is matching up to its ambitionson trans inclusion.CONCLUSIONIn terms of trans-positivity, many, but not all, of the recent schoolguidance documents are prioritising affirmative language whenwriting about trans children. Language plays an important rolein how school staff understand and engage with trans childrenand adolescents, and efforts to avoid pathologisation and ensuretrans-positivity are critical. The majority of documents includedemphasis on trans visibility and representation, though only fewof them outline the reasons for the importance of visibility. SomeFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 12 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6761Horton Raising Ambition for Trans Childrenschools provide visibility targeted at trans pupils, so they cansee a positive future for themselves, while failing to note theequal importance of trans visibility for cis pupils, to increase thelegitimacy of trans lives, and to reduce the burden on trans pupilsto educate and explain themselves to their peers. For trans pupilsin our nursery, primary and secondary schools, questioning andignorance exert a daily toll, a burden that is unreasonable foryoung shoulders to carry. Visibility and representation havemultiple important benefits, letting trans pupils know that theyare not alone, giving reassurance that the school supports and willstand up for trans pupils, providing a sense of school belongingto trans pupils, and legitimising trans pupils in front of theircis peers.The literature identifies some shifts needed in trans inclusiveeducation. At the heart this represents a shift in expectationsand ambition for trans pupils, from aspiring for resilience andprotection from violence and abuse, to aspiring for self-confident,secure pupils who are validated and represented both in dailyschool life and across the curriculum, children with equality ofopportunity to their cis peers, pupils who can excel and thriveat school. In one interview a school head teacher approvinglyremarked that trans pupils weren’t looking for basic safety orbasic access to facilities, they “wanted everything to change”(Sadowski and Jennings, 2016, 83). Given the growing numbersof trans children confident to come out in our schools (Telferet al., 2015), schools need to give greater consideration of howthey can ensure the well-being of these children, helping themgrow up as happy, healthy and supportedmembers of our schools(Neary, 2019).One critical shift is from a narrow definition of school safetyto a focus on emotional safety. Violence and transphobic abuseremain serious concerns for too many trans pupils. Yet, evenin contexts where schools have a commitment to protectionfrom transphobic bullying, trans pupils experience cisnormativemicroaggressions that impact on their well-being. Commitmentto tackling intentional transphobic bullying is very important, butit is only a first step toward a positive school climate for transpupils, not an end goal. Underpinning this shift is commitment tounderstanding the ways in which trans pupils experience and arenegatively impacted by systemic cisnormativity, the additionalburden this places on trans pupils’ shoulders and the cumulativetoll it takes. Cisnormativity contributes tominority stress (Meyer,2003), negatively impacting on well-being and mental health.A second key shift is in acknowledging the barriers to trans-emancipatory education. There are pressures and disincentivesto trans-inclusive practice that need to be recognised andstrategically addressed. These barriers include the culture ofsilence surrounding LGBT and especially trans lives in schools,with educators in the UK still constrained by the after-effects ofdiscriminatory legislation such as section 28. Teacher attitudesand confidence combine to create a second barrier that needsto be addressed, with a complex interplay between teacherswho are prejudiced, teachers who feel creating a trans inclusiveatmosphere is political (in a way that cisnormativity is notconsidered political), teachers who deprioritize the needs oftrans children in view of assumed parental conservatism, andthe teachers who feel under-trained or under-supported to act.Clear leadership is essential, and in the absence of strongtrans-inclusive leadership at national level this leadership andcommitment needs to be shown by governors, head teachers andindividual members of staff.A third shift that is needed is from individualisedaccommodation to proactive adaptation. Many school staffundergoing trans-inclusivity training perceive it as not directlyrelevant to their practice as they do not knowingly have a transpupil in their class. However, given prevalence estimates, mostteachers will have taught a trans pupil, they may just not havebeen aware. At present, trans-inclusive adaptations are too oftenprompted by a specific pupil, a “sacrificial lamb” who sends aschool into “panic,” and for whom individualised adaptations aremade, adaptations that may not be sustained or transferred towider classes. The pressure that this individualised approach putson pioneer children and families is immense and unreasonable.The current emphasis on following an individual child’s needsand preferences is absolutely critical, but this should not bea replacement for schools making pre-emptive and sustainedchanges to benefit current and future trans pupils.The fourth shift that is required is from accommodation toa rights and responsibilities based approach. Current emphasisin schools is on asking trans students what they want andseeing what adaptations can be accommodated, a “negotiation”approach. Trans pupils and families may not be aware of theirrights, or may be uncomfortable claiming their rights. A childrights based approach emphasizes the entitlements that transpupils have, and is clear that these rights are neither negotiable orlimitable. There also needs to be a shift from individual rights toinstitutional responsibilities, ensuring schools are fulfilling theirduty of care to trans pupils.Lastly, we must raise our ambition of what it means tobe an effective ally to trans pupils. The bar needs to beraised from a basic level of respect—using correct pronouns,not discriminating against trans pupils, intervening in casesof abuse—to shifting the systemic injustices that harm transpupils. Integral to this is an understanding of cisnormativitywithin education systems and cultures, and the ways in whichcisnormativity privileges cisgender individuals and makes lifeharder for trans pupils. Trans pupils shoulder a triple burdenof persistent often unintentional delegitimisation; having to,often single-handedly, educate about gender diversity andcisnormativity; and having to self-advocate for their right to atrans-inclusive school. In the absence of effective and informedallies, trans pupils face this challenge alone. This burden is evenharder to bear for themany trans pupils facing additional stresses,including those who have unsupportive or abusive families, thosefacing harassment and hate inside and outside of school, andthose with wider intersecting axes of marginalisation includingdisabled trans children, neurodiverse trans children and transchildren of colour.LIMITATIONS AND AREAS FOR FURTHERSTUDYThis study has relied on secondary data, including analysis ofexisting literature and school guidance documents. The literaturereview provides limited insight on intersectional experiences,Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 13 August 2020 | Volume 5 | Article 6762Horton Raising Ambition for Trans Childrenfor example on the experiences of disabled, neurodiverse orblack trans children. The literature has limited considerationof non-binary or gender fluid children, and limited data ontrans children who are not supported at home. Finally theliterature has limited first-hand accounts from trans childrenof their experiences, especially from younger pre-adolescenttrans children. The conclusions and recommendations in thisstudy can be strengthened through interviews and analysiswith key informants including teachers, youth workers andparents of trans children. The research can be further improvedby targeted interviews with trans children, gaining theirinsights into the findings and recommendations outlined above,additional steps that will be part of ongoing PhD research bythe author.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe author confirms being the sole contributor of this work andhas approved it for publication.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWith thanks to Anna Carlile; Sheryl Clark; Josella Hervey; JoHirst; Sam Martin, Lisa Vine, and Anna Chivers.REFERENCESAirton, L., and Koecher, A.

A study was conducted with 655cis women (471 heterosexuals, 179 bisexuals and lesbians) and 174 cis men (120heterosexuals, 54 bisexuals and gays). Descriptive, multivariate analysis of variance,bivariate correlations and multiple regression were used. In general, the groups of menand heterosexuals obtained higher negativity scores and lower acceptance scores, withsignificant correlations being more frequent in the heterosexual group. Predictive modelsconfirmed the literature on social and ideological conservatism.Keywords: homonegativity, binegativity, pro-trans, sexism, ex post facto studyINTRODUCTIONOne half century after the famous Stonewall uprising in New York City, the violence faced bylesbians (L), gays (G), bisexuals (B), and trans individuals (T) continues to be a social reality. InSpain, one of the countries where LGBT individuals enjoy the greatest number of rights (ILGA,2019) and where more than 80% of the population supports education on the subjects of genderidentity and sexual-emotional diversity (Eurobarometer, 2019), the situation has not always beenideal. For example, in 1975, according to a survey done by the Revista Guadiana magazine, 83% ofthe population believed that homosexuality and everything associated with it (such as trans) shoulddisappear (Mora, 2018). Despite progress, concerns remain about the threat to LGBT rights. Infact, since 2011 Spain has dropped 10 spots to eleventh place due to the absence of legislation thatguarantees protection (ILGA, 2019). According to the Eurobarometer (2019), the low perception ofdiscrimination held by the population (between 39 and 54% according to the area) contrasts withan increase in hate crime incidents: from 169 in 2015 to 271 in 2017 (Ministry of the Interior, 2018);or from 107 in 2015 (Martín-Peréz et al., 2016) to 623 in 2017 (Rebollo et al., 2018).There are no clear numbers about incidents in the university context, although some studies havecautioned that Spanish universities are not violence-free areas (FELGTB, 2013; Rebollo et al., 2018).Incidents involving Spanish professors (Borraz, 2018; Peñalver, 2018) and campaigns carried outby organizations opposed to educational coexistence and inclusion (Arribas, 2019) serve as moregeneral indicators of these systems of violence.Because of the possibility of differentiating hate crimes or incidents against the LGBTcommunity from others, the motivation can be deduced: LGBTphobia, a motivation based on aFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 206368fpsyg-11-02063 August 20, 2020 Time: 20:5 # 2López-Sáez et al. LGBT-Negativity in Psychology Studentsset of beliefs that result in abuse and discrimination. An incidentis the more visible consequence of imperceptible attitudes. Thestudy of attitudes, however, has received less attention. Whileinstitutions focus on consequences that expose an urgent socialproblem (Cvetkovich, 2018), there are other forms of hate that donot manifest themselves in the form of an incident or crime: theexpression of negative attitudes.The discourses of the various social and health scienceshave also been imbued with these negative attitudes, inparticular psychology. Inside this discipline, the clinical branchmonopolized the study of working with LGBT individuals.In Spain, the discipline maintained a pathologizing discourseuntil the mid-1980s (Mora, 2018). However, an internationalevolution, guided by American psychology, had several phases.Beginning in the 1930s and until the 1970s, within the paradigmof differences in personality features, a wide range of theories andtools were developed to justify the inferiority of women and todetect and/or correct deviations in gender expression, orientationand identity (López-Sáez et al., 2019). It was not until 1975 thatthe American Psychological Association supported eliminatinghomosexuality as a disorder, one year later than its psychiatriccolleagues working on the DSM-II. Four years later, the samesituation occurred with transsexuality in the DSM-III. While intheory, homosexuality and transsexuality officially disappearedas disorders, in reality, they continued to be pathologized inother categories (Grau, 2017). The evolution of the two “sick-making” processes (homosexuality and trans) followed the samecourse in that the malaise was attributed to not followingthe cisheteronormative patterns used as diagnostic indicatorsof identity disorders. Moreover, until quite recently, Spanishpsychologists continued to employ instruments with items whosecontents were used to “diagnose” this split (Marano, 2009).However, as observed in the recent literature on the subject(Meyer, 2003; López-Sáez et al., 2019), thanks to criticism fromsocial psychology and other disciplines, some transformationstook place. The perspective of the pathologizing diagnosisthat placed responsibility on the transgressor of the norm(traditional, heterosexual and cisgender femininity/masculinity)using tools to evaluate personality features was replaced byone that problematized those who penalized the transgressionsusing evaluations. The scientific literature has described theseattitudes as phobias or negativities. Although some authorscurrently defend the use of an umbrella term like “sexualprejudice” (Herek and McLemore, 2013), this study prefersto recognize differentiation, linkages and the idiosyncrasies ofdifferent LGBT individuals.The order in which the studies of each negativity regardingdissident identities emerged is not arbitrary in a scientifictradition that has focused on male homosexuality. The traditionof measuring homonegativity is more extensive when comparedto binegativity or transnegativity. Initially, consistent withAlfred Kinsey’s polarized classifications and Michael Storms’sdimensional focus, works concentrated on looking at phobiatoward gays and lesbians (Smith, 1971; Weinberg, 1972).The term “phobia” in and of itself has been the object oftheoretical discussion, since the fear and apprehension linkedto its meaning limits the inclusion of a wide range of negativeconnotative inferences, cognitions and feelings (Hudson andRicketts, 1980; Fyfe, 1983; Haaga, 1991; Logan, 1996). Giventhis, a proposal was made to use “homonegativity” (Hudson andRicketts, 1980) to define the valence of the type of attribution, and“heterosexism” (Herek, 1992; Nakayama, 1998) to reveal the placeof heterosexual privilege. However, the term that continues to bemost often used on a colloquial basis is “homophobia” (Borrillo,2001). On the basis of the given definitions, homonegativitycan be summarized as attitudes prejudiced against gay-lesbianidentity or anything associated with it. “Anything associatedwith it” is understood to refer to deviations from the coherencebetween gender expression, erotic desire and assigned genderidentity. Therefore, homonegativity is not only experienced byLG, but also by other individuals whose deviation is associatedwith homosexuality, for example, an effeminate man or amasculine woman (Guash, 2006).Some studies have argued that socialization in heterosexualmasculinity is in and of itself homophobia, since it views malefemininity as a threat (Worthington et al., 2002; Warriner et al.,2013). In that respect, a number of previous studies have foundconnections between those who inhabit a gender identity as men,sexism, homophobia and conservatism (Warriner et al., 2013;Worthen, 2013; Dierckx et al., 2017; Rye et al., 2019).Looking back, the first tools that measured homonegativity –although this was not their objective – were the masculinity scalesof the 1930s (López-Sáez and García-Dauder, 2020). However,the first instruments explicitly created for that purpose began toappear in the 1970s, when the paradigm shifted and specific toolsto detect manifest negative attitudes were developed (Hudsonand Ricketts, 1980; Aguero et al., 1984). During the 1990s andbeyond, the emphasis was placed on detecting more subtle beliefs(O’Donohue and Caselles, 1993; Wright et al., 1999). Currently,the academic debate is focusing on searching for theoriesand instruments to provide information that can detect moreimperceptible and modern forms of homonegativity. Accordingto Morrison and Morrison (2002), one of the most often citedworks, some of the most prominent beliefs that characterize theseless visible forms argue that: the question of inequality is out-dated, rarely encountered today and is not serious; demandsfor rights are exaggerated and radical; and homosexuality istolerable, as long as its expressions are not aired. In addition, theresults found by Morrison and Morrison (2002) showed higherscores for heterosexual men than for women and support thepresence of correlations among political conservatism, sexism,and homonegativity.Recent works have found additional connections on whichnew beliefs are based: sexist perspectives that establish spheresof masculinity and femininity are related to considerationsregarding the supposed suitability of gays and lesbians for specificstereotyped roles (Walls, 2008); being part of cisheterosexualprivilege correlates with disinterest (willful ignorance) of LGBTrealities (Brownfield et al., 2018); and the false respectabilityof any orientation, as long as it is kept outside the family(Walls, 2008).The interest in attitudes toward bisexuals has been muchmore recent in the empirical literature (Mulick and Wright,2002), despite their being a majority in the LGBT communityFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 206369fpsyg-11-02063 August 20, 2020 Time: 20:5 # 3López-Sáez et al. LGBT-Negativity in Psychology Students(Copen et al., 2016), having worse mental and physical health(Shearer et al., 2016) and being more affected by stressors likeabuse and cyberabuse (Kann et al., 2018). The term “biphobia”did not appear until 1992 (Bennett, 1992) and although theauthors of the most widely used scale were still using it in2008 (Mulick and Wright, 2002), in the 2012 revision, Yostand Thomas recommended using “binegativity,” for reasonssimilar to those surrounding the use of “homonegativity.”The delay was due to the categorization of biphobia as partof homophobia. This explanation is based on the idea thatdesire for the same gender identity is read as transgressingthe heterosexual norm. However, although homophobia andbiphobia share some roots because of the heteronormativesplit, bisexuals also break from the monosexuality impliedby gay-lesbian desire. Biphobia is the result of a dualdelimited dichotomy between heterosexual-homosexual andmen-women (Hertlein et al., 2016). Bisexual invisibility is aconsequence of the belief that defines bisexuality as an invalidor unreal orientation (Burke and LaFrance, 2016), confusionor indecision (Dyar et al., 2017) or transition (Alarie andGaudet, 2013) in the best of cases. The first scales thatapproached binegativity as a separate entity outside the umbrellaof homosexuality focused on the attitudes of the heterosexualpopulation (Eliason, 1997) and later included gays and lesbians(Mulick and Wright, 2002). Mulick and Wright (2002) werethe first to highlight the importance of sexual orientationin measuring biphobia, raising the possibility that negativeattitudes come not only from heterosexuals, but also fromgays and lesbians. Their results showed a higher level ofbiphobia among heterosexuals, correlations among homophobia,biphobia and conservative beliefs, and a higher intensity ofcorrelations in the heterosexual sample. Current studies continueto investigate the nuances of sexual orientation in the negativeassessment of bisexuality: from the heterosexual perspective,bisexual women/men are “lacking in real desire”/“embarrassingto manhood,” and from the lesbian-gay point of view, theyare “traitors and heterosexuals”/“not daring to face stigmaand true gays” (Matsick and Conley, 2016; Matsick andRubin, 2018). Yost and Thomas (2012), in turn, highlight theimportance of considering gender identity as a key variable fora better understanding of the construct of binegativity. Theirresults indicate greater binegativity against bisexual men amongheterosexual men.Alongside these deviations from the paths that guide desiretoward heterosexuality and shape correct gender expressions(Ahmed, 2019), others have emerged that question the medicalidentity assigned at birth (Fausto-Sterling, 2006). These trans andgender diverse (fluid or non-conformist) individuals experiencemore violence, as different axes of oppression, such as sexism,homophobia and the like, intersect in them. This was highlightedby data in the report “Being Trans in the EU” (FRA, 2014), whichfound that trans individuals experience greater discriminationin the workplace, education and healthcare, among other areas.They are subjected to violence that depends on performativesuccess according to cisheteronorms (CIDH, 2015).The amount of violence contrasts with the lack of systematicresearch into the attitudes that generate it (Hill and Willoughby,2005; Kanamori et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the first studiesof this phenomenon appeared a decade before studies onhomonegativity. Initial interest in measuring transphobia can beexplained by theories on the subject of the paradigm of genderidentity developed by Robert Stoller and John Money in the1950s and 60s. The first instrument sought to explore “negativeattitudes toward trans” among health professionals (Green et al.,1966). However, it was not until 2002 that Hill used the term“transphobia,” conceptualized as hatred or emotional repugnancetoward those who do not meet the cisheteronorm imposed bya stereotyped dualist ideology (Hill, 2002). In the same vein,other studies refined the measurements and components thatform part of transphobia. Furthermore, these studies broughtclarity to the connections between the prejudices that shareroots in terms of gender transgression (whether expression,roles or sexuality), as shown by the positive and significantcorrelations among transphobia, LGBnegativity, sexism (Hill andWilloughby, 2005; Tebbe et al., 2014) and political conservatism(Nagoshi et al., 2008). Additionally, according to Nagoshiet al. (2008), gender identity is an important variable thatdifferentiates men from women in that women were lesstransferable and their transphobia could be predicted on the basisof benevolent sexism.In 2017, Kanamori et al. (2017) preferred to speak of “attitudestoward trans” and added culturally important elements likeadvances in civil rights and beliefs associated with biology andconservative and religious moralities. In this way, they proposedan approach focused more on the acceptance of trans people andless on negativity. Their results indicated that the gender identityof the evaluators makes a difference, with men scoring lowest intrans acceptance on all dimensions.As seen above, various negative beliefs pervade the narrativeabout LGBT in the form of emotional inferences and attributionsand conduct. Through them, an amalgam of explicit and/or subtlerejections are reflected that comprise ambivalence patterns thatchange over time. This structure is similar to the construct ofsexism, where different models have posited a more modern,subtle, benevolent bidimensionality on the one hand, and amore traditional, explicit and hostile one on the other (Glickand Fiske, 1997). Sexism is defined by beliefs that justify thesupremacy of the male over the female; delimit the roles,characteristics and behaviors suitable for men and women;establish heterosexuality as obligatory and necessary for themaintenance of power; and consider any opportunity for equalityto be excessive and unnecessary. Consequently, the analogybetween sexism and other constructs seems to comply withan ideology that establishes situations of subordination andsubjugation for those who depart from the prescribed course.Therefore, it is no surprise that, as with sexism, male subjectstend to score higher and correlate positively with the differentconstructs that define negative attitudes toward LGBT people.In other words, based on previous literature, gender identity hasbeen a key variable in determining the levels of LGBTnegativityand sexism. However, this is not the only variable, since sexualorientation intersects with gender identity, configuring normalityand queer. LGBT people may display negative attitudes towardany of the acronyms in their group and even against their own,Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 206370fpsyg-11-02063 August 20, 2020 Time: 20:5 # 4López-Sáez et al. LGBT-Negativity in Psychology Studentsdue to an internalization of cisheteronorms. However, few studieshave advanced in fully understanding attitudes toward LGBTindividuals (with a measurement that takes into account morethan one or two of the constructs seen) and the importance ofthe intersection of gender and sexual orientation (Worthen, 2013;Tebbe et al., 2014).All of the scales and theories about negativities shareconnections, being based on conservative ideological and sexistconcepts. A large number of studies view political conservatismand sexism as predictor variables when it comes to anticipatinganti-LGBT attitudes (Warriner et al., 2013; Austin and Jackson,2019). Other studies indicate a lack of contact with LGBTindividuals as a variable that is closely connected with levels ofnegativity (Lytle and Levy, 2015; Badenes-Ribera et al., 2016;Dierckx et al., 2017).The aim of this study, carried out with heterosexual and LGBindividuals, is to promote an understanding of the correlationsamong each of the constructs examined above, as well as theirconnection to sexism, political conservatism, contact networksand perceived or experienced stigmatization. The analysis issituated in the current Spanish context where, despite advances,social, professional and academic arguments in the field ofpsychology continue to be made that endorse discriminatorypositions (De Benito, 2005; Ruíz, 2019; Villascusa, 2019).Furthermore, studies of attitudes toward LGBT individuals in thecontext of education have barely mapped the Spanish universitysituation (Penna, 2012; Varo et al., 2015) and even less so inthe field of psychology. In the Spanish context, it is noteworthythat there are no compulsory classes on gender, diversity andhealth in the psychology degree, particularly given that the basicdegree allows graduates to practice professionally as psychologistswith all the legal competencies and functions of the profession.Therefore, and more than ever, the recommendations foundin the APA (2012, 2015) guidelines and other organizationsare relevant. They call for a review of the attitudes of futuregenerations of professional psychologists (Kite and Bryant-Lees, 2016). We argue that have an understanding of thecollective thinking regarding sex and gender diversity and bettercomprehending the relationships between negativities and thefactors that underpin them, is essential for an initial screening ofthe situation in Spain.MATERIALS AND METHODSParticipantsA representative sample of 831 students from three publicuniversities in Madrid who are studying psychology took part.Regarding the academic year, 50% belonged to the first cycle (firstand second academic years) and 50% to the second cycle (thirdand fourth academic years).InstrumentsExcept for the questionnaire on sociodemographic aspects, thescales used a response format from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6(strongly agree) in order to avoid neutral answer trends and tohomogenize the survey information.Sociodemographic QuestionnaireThis included gender identity, sexual orientation, age, academicyear, nationality, socioeconomic level, political affiliation, contactand perceived stigma.For gender identity, although the student sample hadoriginally been selected on the basis of the data provided toeach university, the question was asked again to avoid anyinaccuracies. The self-report provided several closed options (cisman, cis woman, trans man, trans woman, fluid gender, non-binary gender) and one open option that could be filled in (forpeople who did not choose from one the above categories).For sexual orientation, like gender identity, several closedcategories were offered (heterosexual, gay-lesbian, bisexual,asexual, pansexual, demisexual) and one open one thatcould be filled in.For the academic year (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) and fornationality, closed categories were offered with the full rangeof options. For age, participants wrote down the number thatcorresponded to them.For political affiliation, a single-element measurement wasused (Gerbner et al., 1984), based on a 4-point Likert scale(left = 1, center-left = 2, center-right = 3, right = 4) and thepolitical affiliation variable appears as “political conservatism orright-wing political”.For contact, three items were used that asked about theexistence or lack of contact with LG, B, and T individuals in somesocial circle. These items used a dichotomous response format(yes = 1, no = 2) and the contact variable appears as “lack ofcontact or no contact”.Perceived stigma was determined by the question used byHertlein et al. (2016): “Is it ever easier or preferable to notself-identify your sexual orientation in certain situations orwith certain people?” The response option was dichotomous(yes = 1, no = 2).Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI)In its short version, this consists of 12 items to evaluate sexismusing two subscales that measure hostile sexism (ASI-HS) andbenevolent sexism (ASI-BS). Rollero et al. (2014) report a goodalpha coefficient of internal consistency (ASI-HS, α = 0.85; ASI-BS, α = 0.80). In this study, the internal consistencies were 0.84and 0.70, respectively.Modern Homonegativity Scale (MHS)This 24-item scale measures contemporary negative attitudestoward gays and lesbians. The items “gay men/lesbian womenwho are ‘out of the closet’ should be admired for their courage”were found to be particularly ambiguous and were, thus,eliminated. The highest scores indicate greater contemporarynegativity. Morrison and Morrison (2002) report alphacoefficients with optimal internal consistency for gays (α = 0.91)and lesbians (α = 0.87). In this study, the internal consistencieswere 0.87 and 0.88, respectively.Biphobia Scale (BphS)This scale consists of 30 items that provide a measurement ofnegative attitudes toward bisexuality.

LGBT-Negativity in Psychology Studentsthat touch on cognitive, emotional and behavioral factors, it isunidimensional. The higher scores indicate greater binegativity.Mulick and Wright (2002) report an alpha coefficient ofinternal consistency of 0.94. In this study, the internalconsistency was 0.81.Transgender Attitude and Belief Scale (TABS)This 29-item scale measures attitudes toward trans individualsthrough three dimensions: interpersonal comfort; beliefsregarding gender identity; and human value. High scoresindicate a greater degree of acceptance of trans diversity. Theitems were adapted, replacing the term “transgender” with“trans,” since that picks up on a greater variety of identities andgender expressions that diverge from the gender medically thatwas assigned at birth (for example: transgender, transsexual,gender fluid or non-binary, queer, etc.) Kanamori et al. (2017)report an optimal alpha coefficient of internal consistency(α = 0.98). In this study, the internal consistency was 0.88.ProcedureA stratified random sampling was used with proportionalallocation for each of the three universities. Out of a totalpopulation of 3,745 students, the sample size was determined fora confidence level of 95%, a maximum variability and a maximumerror of ±3%. The groups for each level were selected randomly.The selection of participants followed proportional criteriaaccording to gender identity (men, women) and the academicyear recorded in the academic records of each university. Therejection rate of the selected individuals was 30%. At two ofthe universities, the selected individuals were contacted whenattending one of their face-to-face classes. At another university,people were contacted by email. In any case, all participantsaccessed an online questionnaire. All the participants receivedthe same instructions and were informed that their participationwas voluntary and their responses confidential. Before beginning,they had to read and accept the informed consent. The studywas approved by the Autónoma University Research EthicsCommittee, which coordinated the study.RESULTSDescriptive StatisticsIn total, 79% of the participants were cis women and 21%cis men. Due to the low sample size (N = 2), trans studentswere excluded from the analysis for this study. Among the ciswomen, 72.7% identified themselves as heterosexual, 25.8% asbisexual and 1.5% as lesbian. Among the cis men, 69% identifiedthemselves as heterosexual, 13.8% as bisexual and 17.2% as gay.The ages ranged from 17 to 60 (asymmetry = 6.09, Mdn = 20,Mo = 19). Almost all the participants self-identified as middle-lower class (36.1%) or middle-upper class (57.3%), while very fewconsidered themselves either lower class (4.7%) or upper class(1.9%). With regard to political affiliation, 42.2% identified withthe left, 35.7% with the centre-left, 19.5% with the centre-rightand 2.5% with the right.Due to the small sample size of gay (N = 30) and lesbian(N = 10) individuals, when segmenting by gender identity,they were grouped with the bisexuals, leaving one LGB group(N = 233) and one heterosexual group (N = 596). Additionally,the homonegativity scores toward gays and homonegativityscores toward lesbians were averaged to obtain a single score inorder to prevent problems of collinearity and to be able to makecomparisons with the other scales that did not provide a specificnegativity according to gender identity.Descriptive statistics were obtained for each variable, alongwith a visual examination of histogram and normality tests. Thescores for each dimension were calculated by averaging the items.Table 1 presents the means and standard deviationsby gender identity (men/women) and sexual orientation(heterosexuals/LGB) for MHS, BphS, TABS, ASI, politicalconservatism, lack of contact, and perceived stigma.Multivariate Analysis of VarianceDifferences in gender identity and sexual orientation wereanalyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).The scales related to political conservatism, lack of contactand perceived stigma were considered dependant variables,while gender identity and sexual orientation were theindependent variables.The results from the MANOVA indicated significances in theinteraction (gender identity/sexual orientation) F(10, 816) = 3.64,p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.04.In MHS, the interaction between gender identity and sexualorientation was significant [F(1, 825) = 5.50, p < 0.05,ηp2 = 0.007]. This type of interaction requires simple-effectsanalyses to be interpreted without error (see León and Montero,2015). The simple-effects analyses for gender identity showedthat significant differences existed between heterosexual menand women [F(1, 594) = 21.09, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.05]and LGB [F(1, 231) = 4.45, p < 0.05, ηp2 = 0.02], withmen scoring higher.

The simple-effects analyses for gender identityshowed significant differences between heterosexual men andwomen [F(1, 594) = 70.88, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.11], withthe men scoring higher. However, among LGB individuals[F(1, 231) = 1.34, p = 0.25, ηp2 = 0.006] there were nosignificant differences. The simple-effects analyses for sexualorientation showed that for both women [F(1, 653) = 20.42,p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.03] and men [F(1, 172) = 28.03, p < 0.001,ηp2 = 0.14], heterosexuals scored higher than LGB for this typeof sexism.The interactions between gender identity and sexualorientation were also significant regarding lack of LG contact[F(1, 825) = 7.14, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.009] and T contact[F(1, 825) = 8.86, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.011]. The simple-effectsanalyses for gender identity showed significant differencesbetween heterosexual men and women in the lack of LGcontacts [F(1, 594) = 17.63, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.03] and Tcontacts [F(1, 594) = 9.50, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.02], with menscoring higher. However, there were no significant differencesamong LGB individuals [LG, F(1, 231) = 0.06, p = 0.81,ηp2 = 0.0002; T, F(1, 231) = 2.03 p = 0.16, ηp2 = 0.009]. Thesimple-effects analyses for sexual orientation showed significantdifferences among both women [LG, F(1, 653) = 4.36, p < 0.05,ηp2 = 0.007; T, F(1, 653) = 33.25, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.05]and men [LG, F(1, 172) = 10.55, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.06; T,F(1, 172) = 57.37, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.25], with heterosexualsscoring higher.In ASI-BS, BphS and TABS, both gender identity andsexual orientation showed significant primary effects. Theprimary-effects analyses for gender identity in ASI-BS [F(1,825) = 14.51, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.02] and BphS [F(1,825) = 22.83, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.03] showed significantdifferences between men and women, with men scoringhigher. The primary-effects analyses for sexual orientationshowed significant differences between heterosexuals and LGBindividuals [ASI-BS, F(1, 825) = 13.18, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.02);BphS, F(1, 825) = 19.22, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.02], withheterosexuals scoring higher. Similarly, but conversely, inTABS, the primary-effects analyses for gender identity [F(1,825) = 25.01, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.03] and sexual orientation [F(1,825) = 27.38, p < 0.001 ηp2 = 0.03] showed significant differencesbetween men and women and between heterosexuals and LGBindividuals, with women in both groups and LGB individualsscoring higher.Finally, the primary-effects analyses for sexual orientation inpolitical conservatism [F(1, 825) = 62.50, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.07]and lack of B contact [F(1, 825) = 30.13, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.04]showed significant differences between heterosexuals and LGB,with heterosexuals scoring higher. Conversely, in the primary-effects analysis for sexual orientation in perceived stigma [F(1,825) = 853.71, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.51], LGB individualsscored higher.Correlations and Multiple RegressionAnalysisA bivariate correlation analysis was done using the samevariables. The correlations were estimated using Spearman’s ρcoefficient due to the violation of the assumptions of continuityor normality in all of the pairs of variables. Table 2 shows thecorrelations for MHS, BphS, and TABS with themselves and withASI-BS and ASI-HS, political conservatism and perception ofstigma for heterosexual men and women and LGB individuals.Additionally, a multiple regression analysis was carried outusing the stepwise method. The model analysis was doneseparately for four groups according to gender identity andorientation. Moreover, and according to the pertinent literature,homo-binegativity (MHS and BphS) and pro-trans attitudes(TABS) were predicted based on sexism (ASI-BS and ASI-HS) and political conservatism. The predictive potential of themodels was done using the adjusted R2 statistic, while thepredictive potential of each predictor was evaluated using itsstandardized dependent variable with confidence intervals of95%. The assumptions were evaluated using collinearity statistics,Q-Q and residual plots and the Durbin-Watson statistic.The results in Table 3 present the analyses of the model formen and women for the MHS, BphS, and TABS predictions.As the tolerances for all the variables introduced were above0.10, multicollinearity between the predictors was discarded.Among the heterosexual women, both sexism (ASI-HS andASI-BS) and political conservatism were predictor variables onthe whole for MHS and BphS and negatively for TABS. On thecontrary, among LB women, only ASI-HS was a predictor forMHS and BphS (since TABS had no predictors).Among men, the components of the predictor models weremore heterogenous. Among heterosexual men, ASI-HS andpolitical conservatism were positive predictors for MHS, andboth sexisms (ASI-HS and ASI-BS) for BphS, while bothsexisms and political conservatism were negative predictors forTABS. Among GB, both sexisms positively predicted MHS andnegatively predicted TABS. All the determination coefficientswere above 0.35, with most of the cases having moderate to highlevel predictions.DISCUSSIONThis study has made it possible to explore the correlationsbetween constructs and analyze their behavior and the differencesbetween heterosexual men and women and LGB individuals. Italso contributes to the theoretical postulates regarding predictorvariables related to LGBT-negativity.The results affirm that sexual orientation is a determinantvariable with regard to the degree of LGBT-negativity. In thisrespect, LGB individuals show less sociopolitical conservatism(with a political affiliation inclined toward the left and fewersexist beliefs) and less homo-binegativity, as well as attitudesthat are more favorable toward trans individuals, more contactswith LGBT individuals and a lower perception of stigma.Moreover, regarding MHS, ASI-HS and the lack of LG and Tcontacts, gender identity indicated significant differences.

However, beinga man or woman was significant among LGB individuals. Onesign of this was the higher level of ASI-BS among GB men. Thisis consistent with the earlier literature that defines masculinityby the negative assessment of any otherness associated withfeminity (Worthington et al., 2002; Warriner et al., 2013;Ahmed, 2019). Despite forming part of a group that is subjectto violence, the pyramid of privilege that demarcates sexistspheres allows for stigmatization and the negative assessmentof those left behind (Glick et al., 2015). The importance ofgender identity is also significant in the differences in BphS andTABS, which seems to indicate a stagnant, binary perspective onthe part of men.The correlational findings confirm the relationship betweenthe different constructs, with ASI-HS having the mostsignificant correlations with the other variables. Additionally, thecorrelations between TABS and BphS were high, which could beFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 206374fpsyg-11-02063 August 20, 2020 Time: 20:5 # 8López-Sáez et al. LGBT-Negativity in Psychology Studentsconsistent because of the proximity between constructs that positnon-monosexual or non-monoidentity possibilities.In the heterosexual sample, all the variables had significantcorrelations with each other, except for the lack of contactand perceived stigma. The correlations regarding the lack ofcontact were uneven between the men and women. For bothgroups, the lack of B contacts correlates positively with MHSand BphS, but negatively with TABS. The lack of LG contactshas these correlations in the case of men, while for women thelack of T contacts was significant. These differences betweenheterosexual men and women are consistent with models ofidentity construction and socialization. Accepting gender identityas a stagnant, biological category generates perspectives thatpromote heteronormativity and are alert to any performativity.In this way, heterosexual men avoid any proximity or associationwith “gay influence” (Goldstein and Davis, 2010). In addition,as guardians of gender essence, some women reject transpronouncements that alter biology (Butler, 2017).In the LGB population, the correlational differences betweenmen and women had different connection patterns. For men,sexisms correlated significantly with MHS and TABS, while forwomen, only ASI-BS did so with MHS. One explanation forthis is that in GB men, sexist beliefs prevent any confusion withwomen. As GB men have been socialized to reject effeminacy,their “homoerotic desire” must be homonormativized withoutthis entailing any loss of privileges (López-Sáez, 2017). However,according to the findings by Warriner et al. (2013), LB womenmay assess the loss of status that comes with heterosexuality asmore threatening than a change in gender identity.Comparing the heterosexual and LGB samples, there are nosignificant correlations between sexisms and BphS among LGBindividuals. Among heterosexual and LB women, for the former,sexisms correlated with all the constructs (MHS, BphS andTABS), while for the latter, sexisms only significantly correlatedwith MHS. These correlations may be due to the threateningself-perception of the status that LB women have of theirown sexuality. This is even more true for LB women withconservative political beliefs, whose values argue for maintainingthe traditional spheres of masculinity and femininity in linewith particular expressions of desire. In this respect, there was acorrelation between political conservatism and MHS. In contrast,the diffusion of correlations between political conservatism andBphS and TABS may be related to mythologized beliefs that viewbisexuality and trans as “partial” or “temporary” breaks.However, this is not the case for conservative heterosexualwomen, who appear to consider bisexuality and trans as notpart of “the right thing.” These differences between LB andheterosexual women help to explain how orientation and genderidentity intersect in perceived stigma. As observed by Brownfieldet al. (2018), heterosexuality constitutes subjects of privilege whogenerate stigma of which they are not aware. In contrast, LBwomen do perceive and experience this stigma, and they engagein it less (less LGBT-negativity).Comparing heterosexual men with GB men, politicalconservatism loses significance with all the constructs. Thisseems to indicate that among heterosexual men, conservativebelief systems are more determinant when assessing LGBT as athreat. As Warriner et al. (2013) explain, sharing conservativepolitical beliefs lays down certain guidelines about the role thatmen should play that prevent any deviation from cisgender andheterosexuality.The regression analysis provides important information toadd to the correlations. Confirming the earlier literature, modelsthat combine sexist and political conservatism are predictorsof LGBT-negativities. This is seen among heterosexual womenand, with some variations, among heterosexual men, wherecomponents of the model alternate. In the LGB sample, politicalconservatism lost its predictive potential. One explanation forthis is that LGB individuals show less political conservatism andless variability in their political affiliation. Finally, the lack ofpredictors for TABS and BphS may be related to mythologizedbeliefs about the partial or temporary nature of the situationthat does not require a complete break with having sexist andconservative values.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, this study serves as a first step in exploring theseconstructs among psychology students in the Spanish context.It helps to better explain the complexities of the beliefs thatunderpin LGBTphobic discrimination, observing the differencesaccording to sexual orientation and gender identity. However,it is only the beginning of a long road that must acceptintersectionality as the essential foundation for its development.For that reason, more research is required to help explainthe complex articulations of LGBT-negativity. Future studiesshould also expand the size of the LGB sample in order toexplore the differences with bisexuals in detail. It would also beinteresting to develop longitudinal studies that could include aretrospective perspective as knowledge of psychology is acquired.Moreover, despite having carried out a probability sampling witha considerable sample size, the results are only representativeof the public university system. Additionally, the populationof psychology students is clearly feminized, represents mid-to-high socioeconomic levels and shares ideological patterns thatare not very conservative. These patterns may be different inthe case of private secular and religious universities. Similarly,the low racial mix, with a predominance of Caucasians, mayhave had an influence on certain nuances. Future researchshould therefore explore the connections established in moreheterogeneous probability samples.Finally, with regard to practical consequences, we mustconsider how negative attitudes toward LGBT people signalless competence in every type of psychological intervention oraccompaniment. This is not only true in the work done withthe LGBT population itself, but with the general population. TheAPA (2012, 2015) guidelines have been scrupulously clear inthis respect, indicating the importance of training in the LGBTfield for personal review and the recognition of privileges andprejudices. The Spanish National Agency (ANECA, 2005) hasasserted that it is essential for psychology students (particularlycertain profiles) to receive training in sexual-emotional diversity,Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 206375fpsyg-11-02063 August 20, 2020 Time: 20:5 # 9López-Sáez et al.

Analysesand studies that address attitudes toward sexual orientationsand gender identities will make it possible to map educationalprocesses and materials for psychology students and implementchanges in the curricula.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will bemade available by the authors, without undue reservation, to anyqualified researcher.ETHICS STATEMENTThe studies involving human participants were reviewed andapproved by the Comité de Ética de la Investigación de laUniversidad Autónoma de Madrid.

A Critical Analysisof LGBTQ+ Inclusion Policy inSchoolsJonathan Glazzard* and Samuel StonesCarnegie School of Education, Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, United KingdomThis article provides an overview of the UK government policy in relation to relationshipsand sex education in schools. It focuses on the latest statutory guidance which requiresprimary and secondary schools in England to teach pupils about different types ofrelationships, including same-sex relationships. We outline the current policy frameworksand present a rationale for why Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer (LGBTQ+)identities and relationships should be present in the curriculum. We critically interrogatethe government response and we present a framework to support the implementation ofa whole school approach to LGBTQ+ inclusion. We draw on Meyer’s model of minoritystress to explore risks to children and young people if they are not provided with anLGBTQ+ curriculum.Keywords: sexual orientation, LGBTQ+, schools, education, relationships and sex educationINTRODUCTIONIn 2019 the UK government released statutory guidance for relationships and sex educationin schools (Department for Education, 2019) following a period of consultation. The guidancewas a radical update of previous guidance which was issued in 2000 to more accurately reflectsocietal issues in the twenty-first century. The guidance included a requirement for primary andsecondary schools to teach children about LGBTQ+ identities and different kinds of relationships,including same-sex relationships. Although societal attitudes in relation to same-sex relationshipshave improved in recent years, and even though some countries have taken steps to legalize same-sex relationships, the inclusion of this content in the school curriculum was considered by someto be controversial. For example, in 2019 parental opposition in Birmingham and other cities toLGBTQ+ curricula in primary schools dominated the media headlines in England. The apparenttensions between religious beliefs, sexual orientation and gender identity fueled parental protestsoutside primary schools that had adopted an LGBTQ+ curriculum. Subsequent governmentguidance in England to support schools with the advancement of LGBTQ+ equality has been weakand arguably this has demonstrated a lack of political commitment to equality.This paper uses Meyer’s model of minority stress (Meyer’s, 2003) as a conceptual lensto support the analysis of the policy. As a conceptual lens, this model is particularlyuseful in that it helps to frame the experiences of individuals with minority identities. Forexample, LGBTQ+ youth may be exposed to a range of stressors both in society and inschool and these can impact on their ability to thrive within educational environmentsand lead to mental ill health (Meyer’s, 2003). The model identifies that individuals withminority identities are exposed to two additional stressors in addition to the generalstressors that everyone experiences; distal stressors are the direct experience of prejudice anddiscrimination as a direct result of one’s minority identity. Proximal stressors occur when79Glazzard and Stones LGBTQ+ Inclusion Policy in Schoolsindividuals anticipate that they will be exposed to distal stressorswhich can result in concealment of one’s identity and internalizedhomophobia (Meyer’s, 2003). This paper argues that an inclusiverelationships and sex education curriculum, which providesvalidation and positive affirmation of different identities, hasthe potential to reduce minority stress in young people whohave non-normative gender identities and sexual orientations.In addition, we argue that government policy of delaying theintroduction of inclusive relationships education will potentiallyincrease minority stress in young people with these minorityidentities. We therefore argue that a curriculum which addressesinclusive relationships and sex education is a useful tool forreducing the effects of minority stress in LGBTQ+ youth.POLICY CONTEXT IN ENGLANDSexual orientation and gender identity are two crucialcomponents on an individual’s identity, although the Equality Act(2010) in England specifically refers to “gender reassignment.”In England, sexual orientation and gender reassignment areidentified as “protected characteristics” in the Equality Act(2010). Schools and other public institutions must thereforeensure that LGBTQ+ individuals are protected from both directand indirect forms of discrimination. In addition, the PublicSector Equality Duty (Section 149 of the Equality Act, 2010)requires schools to advance equality of opportunity betweenindividuals with and without protected characteristics and tofoster good relations between these two groups.In 2017 the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, delivered akeynote speech at the Pink Awards:Homophobia, biphobia and transphobia have still not been defeatedand they must be. Bullying in schools and on social media is stilla daily reality for young LGBTQ+ people, and that has to stop.Trans people still face indignities and prejudice when they deserveunderstanding and respect. . . being trans is not an illness and itshouldn’t be treated as such.She emphasized the importance of introducing inclusiverelationships and sex education into Britain’s schools. Of course,2017 also marked 50 years following the partial decriminalizationof homosexuality through the 1967 Sexual Offences Act. Thedirection of travel was a stark contrast to Section 28 in1988 which was introduced by the former Conservative PrimeMinister, Margaret Thatcher. Section 28 was a controversialpiece of legislation which stated that local authorities “shallnot intentionally promote homosexuality or publish materialwith the intention of promoting homosexuality or promotethe teaching in any maintained school of the acceptabilityof homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.” Itsilenced schools from discussing homosexuality and forcedLGBTQ+ teachers further into the closet. Section 28 waseventually repealed in 2003. However, its existence demonstratedthe role of educational policy in maintaining a dominantheteronormative discourse, thus leading to the marginalizationof LGBTQ+ people.The parental protests in England in 2019 also demonstratedhow religious beliefs can also seek to maintain discoursesof heteronormativity and also highlighted the ways in whichone protected characteristic (religion or belief) can clash withother protected characteristics (gender reassignment and sexualorientation). During these protests, parents objected to LGBTQ+curricula in primary schools on the grounds that this curriculumwas in direct conflict with religious beliefs. Following a protestat a school in Birmingham, these were repeated in other schoolsin other parts of the UK. These examples of resistance serveto demonstrate the controversial nature of this topic and inparticular the apparent tensions between religion, sexuality andgender identity. However, despite these objections it is importantthat schools leaders respect different opinions, and religiousbeliefs, but also explain to parents why it is necessary for allyoung people to learn about different types of relationships andfamily structures.It should be emphasized that the statutory guidance forrelationships and sex education (Department for Education,2019) does not seek to promote a particular lifestyle. An effectiveLGBTQ+ curriculum enables children and young people to knowthat LGBTQ+ people exist and that it is legal to be LGBTQ+.It supports them to understand different family structures andto know that under the rule of British law it is legal to bothenter into same-sex relationships and get married. It is criticallyimportant that all children are taught to respect all forms ofdifference. It is also important to acknowledge to young peoplethat although LGBTQ+ identities and relationships may not bepermitted within the context of a religion, in the UK they arepermitted under the rule of law. Given that LGBTQ+ people existwithin all walks of life (in families, schools, colleges, universities,the workplace, and the community) it is important that youngpeople learn to respect people’s differences, regardless of personalor religious beliefs. Education should play a critical role insupporting all children and young people to understand thatprejudice and discrimination are wrong, both from a legal anda moral perspective. Critical pedagogy serves a powerful role inadvancing social justice through educating young people aboutall forms of discrimination. It offers hope for creating a better andmore equitable society in the future and supports young peopleto be responsible future citizens.Research has found that LGBTQ+ policies and initiativesin schools which promote queer-straight alliances are distinctlyand mutually important for fostering safer and more supportiveschool climates for young people and may reduce prejudice-based bullying (Poteat et al., 2013; Ioverno et al., 2016; Day et al.,2019). Lessons which address inclusive relationships and sexeducation are one example of these alliances. Creating safe spacesin which all young people can discuss inclusive relationshipsmay therefore play a critical role in fostering positive attitudes,creating positive school cultures and reducing homophobic,biphobic, and transphobic bullying. Research by Russell et al.(2009) found that safe queer-straight alliances led to three inter-related dimensions of empowerment: personal empowerment,relational empowerment, and strategic empowerment. Whenthese three dimensions are experienced in combination, teachersof inclusive relationships and sex education can facilitateFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61328380Glazzard and Stones LGBTQ+ Inclusion Policy in Schoolsindividual and collective empowerment which can lead to socialchange in schools.A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THESTATUTORY GUIDANCEIn 2019 the Department for Education (DfE) published statutoryguidance for the teaching of inclusive relationships and sexeducation in schools in England. The DfE is a governmentorganization that enforces policy in schools. The guidancereplaced previous guidance which was published 20 years earlierand schools in England are required by law to implementthe guidance from 2020. Schools which do not implement thestatutory guidance will face penalties during school inspections.The guidance was refreshed to address current societal issuesand addresses topics such as consent, domestic abuse andonline relationships. It also explicitly mandates the teaching ofLGBTQ+ identities and relationships in primary and secondaryschools. However, in relation to LGBTQ+ content the guidancemight be interpreted in ways which effectively permit schoolsto opt out of delivering this content, particularly to youngerchildren. The quotations from the guidance below particularlyprovide schools with a rationale for not delivering LGBTQ+related content, despite the statutory nature of the guidance.We argue that these opt-out clauses are not acceptable and maypotentially result in LGBTQ+ identities not being validated orpositively affirmed.The Relationships and Sex Education States:• In all schools, when teaching these subjects, the religiousbackground of all pupils must be taken into account whenplanning teaching, so that the topics that are included inthe core content in this guidance are appropriately handled.Schools must ensure they comply with the relevant provisionsof the Equality Act (2010), under which religion or beliefare amongst the protected characteristics (Department forEducation, 2019, para, 20, p. 12).• In particular, schools with a religious character mayteach the distinctive faith perspective on relationships,and balanced debate may take place about issues thatare seen as contentious (Department for Education, 2019,para, 21, p. 12).• Schools should ensure that all of their teaching is sensitiveand age appropriate in approach and content (Departmentfor Education, 2019, para, 37, p. 15).In response to the parental protests, the Departmentfor Education (DfE) introduced the following guidancefor schools:• In all schools, when teaching Relationships Education, the ageand religious background of all pupils must be taken intoaccount when planning teaching (Department for Education,2020a, p. 11).We have added emphasis to the text to draw attention to somekey concerns. Schools will not be compliant with the Equality Act(2010) if young people are not taught to respect different religiousbeliefs. However, there is a danger that schools with a religiouscharacter will use these statements to avoid including LGBTQ+identities and relationships into the curriculum. It is worryingthat the policy permits schools with a religious character to teach“distinctive faith perspectives on relationships” given that someof these perspectives may not align with the principles of theEquality Act (2010). It is also a concern that the teaching ofLGBTQ+ relationships and identities is acknowledged within thepolicy framework as a “sensitive” aspect of the curriculum. Thisphrasing is unhelpful because it further stigmatizes LGBTQ+individuals whose identities should be validated and celebrated.The phrase “age-appropriate” is also potentially damaging. Itsuggests that younger children need to be somehow protectedfrom this content, thus suggesting that it may be potentiallyharmful and damaging. LGBTQ+ people exist within familiesand communities. Young children in nursery schools may havesame-sex parents, siblings or members of their wider family whoare LGBTQ+. To deliberately avoid addressing this in the earlyyears is likely to lead to young children in same-sex families orthose with LGBTQ+ family members feeling excluded. This doesnot foster a sense of belonging and it does not provide validationof children’s families particularly in cases where children haveLGBTQ+ parents or siblings.From 1 September 2020, relationships education iscompulsory for all primary school pupils and relationshipsand sex education (RSE) is compulsory for all secondary schoolpupils (Department for Education, 2020b). However, as a resultof the impact of Covid-19 schools have been given additionaltime to implement the statutory guidance. The governmenthas insisted that secondary schools will risk negative inspectionreports if the statutory guidance is not implemented from thestart of the summer term 2021. In stark contrast, primary schoolswill not be penalized for avoiding the teaching of LGBTQ+content, provided that they can demonstrate that appropriateconsultation has taken place with parents:Before the start of summer term 2021, if a primary school does notteach about LGBT relationships, and does not yet have adequateplans in place to meet the requirements of the DfE’s statutoryguidance by the start of the summer term 2021 (for example, if ithas not consulted parents and has no plans to do so before then),inspectors will comment on this in the inspection report. This willnot, however, impact on the leadership andmanagement judgementexcept when inspectors consider it relevant to the effectiveness ofthe school’s safeguarding arrangements (Department for Education,2020b).From the start of summer term 2021, if a primary school does notteach about LGBT relationships, this will not have an impact onthe leadership and management judgement as long as the schoolcan satisfy inspectors that it has still fulfilled the requirements ofthe DfE’s statutory guidance. If it cannot do this, for example if ithas failed to consult with parents, inspectors will consider this whenmaking the leadership and management judgement. The school willnot ordinarily receive a judgement for this better than requiresimprovement (Department for Education, 2020b).Before the start of summer term 2021, if a secondary school does notteach about LGBT relationships and does not have adequate plansin place to meet the requirements of the DfE’s statutory guidanceFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61328381Glazzard and Stones LGBTQ+ Inclusion Policy in Schoolsby the start of the summer term 2021, inspectors will commenton this in the inspection report. This will not, however, impact onthe leadership and management judgement except when inspectorsconsider it relevant to the effectiveness of the school’s safeguardingarrangements (Department for Education, 2020b).From the start of summer term 2021, if a secondary schooldoes not teach about LGBT relationships, it will not be meetingthe requirements of the DfE’s statutory guidance. Inspectors willconsider this when making the leadership and managementjudgement. For state-funded schools, this only applies to section 5inspections. For independent schools, this only applies to standardinspections. The school will not ordinarily receive a judgement forthis better than requires improvement (Department for Education,2020b).Given that prejudice is often established before children start thesecondary phase of their education, we feel that it is critical thatthe teaching of LGBTQ+ content in primary schools should bemandatory. This latest “opt out clause” permits parental beliefs(and parental prejudice) to determine curriculum content. Thisis not only selling LGBTQ+ pupils in primary schools short,it is also selling all pupils short. It effectively provides schoolsthat are reluctant to address this content with a license notto address it. Large-scale survey data from Stonewall in 2017,the organization which champions equality for the LGBTQ+community, demonstrates the extent of homophobic bullyingin Britain’s schools. The data demonstrated the large prevalenceof homophobic, biphobic, and transphobic bullying in Britain’sschools. We argue that inclusive relationships and sex educationin primary and secondary schools which provides positiveaffirmation of different identities will reduce the prevalence ofprejudice-based bullying.THEORETICAL CRITIQUEMeyer’s (2003) minority stress model has been used bymainstream psychologists to explain how minority status canimpact on mental health outcomes for individuals who identifyas part of a minority group. The model has been applied toindividuals who identify as LGBTQ+.The model identifies different types of stress that minorityindividuals experience. These are summarized below:• General stressors apply to all individuals as a result ofenvironmental circumstances.• Distal stressors: the direct experience of stigma, prejudice,discrimination, victimization and bullying by others basedon an individual’s minority status produces distal stressors.These experiences can be shaped by structural forces(for example, racism, heteronormativity/heterosexism) whichresult in structural disadvantage for minority groups.• Proximal stressors: these relate to an individual’s perceptionor appraisal of situations. The expectation or anticipation thata person with a minority status may experience rejection,discrimination, victimization, or stigmatization based on one’sprevious experiences of this can result in self-vigilance andidentity concealment. People who identify as LGBTQ+ mayanticipate negative reactions to their sexual orientation orgender identity in specific situations due to their previousnegative experiences. To reduce the likelihood of negativeexperiences occurring, self-vigilance and concealment areemployed but these tactics can result in fear of discovery,psychological distress, internalized shame, guilt, anxiety, andsocial isolation.Not addressing LGBTQ+-related content in the primarycurriculum is likely to result in exposing children to distaland proximal stressors. If their identities are not discussedand not made visible through the school environment and thecurriculum, they are more likely to conceal their identities and tointernalize the homophobia to which they are exposed. The aimof an LGBTQ+ curriculum is to validate identities of differenceand to teach children the importance of respect. If this validationof identities is not evident, there is a risk that children withnon-normative identities in primary schools will be exposed toprejudice, violence and other forms of discrimination.International research continues to demonstrate thatheteronormative and heterosexist cultures are entrenched withinschools (Kjaran and Kristinsdóttir, 2015). Even in countriesknown for their liberal attitude toward sexuality, such as Sweden,heteronormative attitudes continue to prevail within schools(Lundin, 2015). The revision of policies and legislation signalthe UK government’s commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion(DePalma and Jennett, 2010). However, despite this, researchcontinues to evidence the scale of homophobic, biphobic, andtransphobic bullying in Britain’s schools (Bradlow et al., 2017).Whilst the reasons for this are complex, multifaceted, and oftenmisunderstood (Formby, 2015), research by Bradlow et al.(2017) does illuminate the disconnect between the government’sexpectations and the lived experiences of those within theLGBTQ+ community.CONCLUSIONData from Stonewall (Bradlow et al., 2017) demonstrates theprevalence of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullyingin schools in Britain. Nearly half of lesbian, gay, bi and transpupils (45%)—including 64% of trans pupils—are bullied forbeing LGBTQ+ at school. The majority of LGBTQ+ pupils-−86%—regularly hear phrases including “that’s so gay” or “you’reso gay” in school. Nearly one in 10 trans pupils (9%) aresubjected to death threats at school. Seven in 10 LGBTQ+ pupils(68%) report that teachers or school staff only “sometimes”or “never” challenge homophobic, biphobic, and transphobiclanguage when they hear it. Two in five LGBTQ+ pupils (40%)are never taught anything about LGBTQ+ identities at school.Three in four LGBTQ+ pupils (77%) have never learnt aboutgender identity and what “trans” means at school. More than halfof LGBTQ+ pupils (53%) say that there isn’t an adult at schoolthey can talk to about being LGBTQ+. Two in five pupils whohave been bullied for being LGBTQ+ (40%) have missed schoolbecause of this bullying. Half of bullied LGBTQ+ pupils (52%)feel that homophobic, biphobic, and transphobic bullying hashad a negative effect on their plans for future education. Morethan four in five trans young people (84%) have self-harmed.Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 4 June 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61328382Glazzard and Stones LGBTQ+ Inclusion Policy in SchoolsFor lesbian, gay, and bi young people who aren’t trans, three infive (61%) have self-harmed. More than two in five trans youngpeople (45%) have attempted to take their own life. For lesbian,gay, and bi young people who aren’t trans, over one in five (22%)have attempted to take their own life (Bradlow et al., 2017).Avoiding teaching LGBTQ-related content in primaryschools is likely to result in a worsening of these statistics.In addition, many young children in primary schools havesame-sex parents or they may have siblings or know otherpeople who are LGBTQ+. Silencing LGBTQ+ identitiesis likely to alienate these children if they start to feelthat their daily realities are not reflected in the schoolenvironment or through the curriculum that they aretaught. Avoiding teaching LGBTQ+ related content toyoung children is likely to result in minority stress andmental ill health (Meyer’s, 2003), especially if queer identitiesare not recognized, not provided with validation and notpositively affirmed.ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONSThe following recommendations are aimed at school leaders:• All primary and secondary schools should provide childrenwith an inclusive relationships education curriculum whichaddresses LGBTQ+ identities and same-sex relationships.• All primary and secondary schools should teach children torespect LGBTQ+ people.• All schools should consult with parents in relation toLGBTQ+-related content but consultation should not lead toa veto on the curriculum.• Penalties should be applied by the school inspectorate toprimary schools that do not teach children about LGBTQ+-related content.• All schools should ensure that their legal obligations in relationto the Equality Act (2010) are met.• All schools should have a clear policy which addressesLGBTQ+ inclusion.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSJG outlined the policy context and offered a theoreticalcritique.

These newregulations have been introduced in response to several state and school system efforts to identifyand enforce laws or initiatives aimed at ensuring the protection of LGBTQ students in educationalinstitutions. Over the last 10 years, studies have revealed that LGBTQ teenagers are a disadvantageddemographic, and that their traumatic school encounters often add to that insecurity. This publicpolicy paper discusses the study that has been conducted on certain federal, regional, and nationalregulations and practices. The author reviews the studies on sexuality formation, with an emphasison the rising proportion of adolescents who “come out” or reveal their LGBTQ sexuality toeveryone else throughout their time at school. Educational institutions are mostly threateningsettings for LGBTQ students; such data is weighed against studies on the effects of impairedacademic performance, cognitive, and mental well-being (Chan et al., 2021). We then examineinterventions in teaching and learning that have been linked to LGBTQ (as well as all) students’welfare (Chan, 2021b). Safe Is Not Enough demonstrates that school systems should provideextensive resources for the healthy growth of LGBTQ students in order to foster more supportiveclassroom cultures. Michael Sadowski in this book discusses current approaches like developing anLGBTQ-friendly syllabus, promoting a welcoming environment throughout the entire school forLGBTQ students, having grown-ups who could serve as counselors and authority figures, as wellas implementing appropriate household and neighborhood engagement campaigns, incorporatingcase studies from classes, campuses, and regions around the nation.For more than two decades, researchers have reported that LGBT adolescents faceincreased levels of abuse, rejection, and violence in educational institutions than theirstraight counterparts. Such adverse events have been published in the United States anda number of different European nations (Palkki and Caldwell, 2018; Scannapieco et al.,2018). These analyses recognized four distinct types of abuse: anti-gay words, oral ridicule,mental oppression, and actual violent behavior, and established that most LGBTQ studentsface name-calling, abusive behavior, intimidation, and violence at school. For instance,in the GLSEN’s National School Climate Survey, Kosciw et al. (2012) discovered that84Chan Book Review: Better Schools for LGBT Studentsalmost all LGBT students encountered offensive commentsat school, with more than 75% hearing them regularly orintensively. Additionally, the writers discovered that more than80% of LGBT students revealed experiencing oral harassment,more than 40% revealed experiencing bodily harassment andmore than 20% revealed experiencing physical assault as a resultof their gender identity.Though improvement on LGBTQ problems in educationalinstitutions has been sluggish, schools in certain areas ofthe nation have taken steps to create healthier and moreaccepting environments for LGBTQ students. Usually, collegesand universities do so by updating their anti-bullying guidelinesand creating gay-straight student alliances (GSAs). However,transforming campuses into environments in which LGBTQstudents could reach their full capacity requires not just a reactivestrategy. Sadowski discusses ways in which teaching staff couldrender their classrooms more conducive to LGBTQ students’healthy growth as well as educational attainment in Safe IsNot Enough.This book begins by introducing audiences to three prominentLGBTQ programs in educational institutions that concentrateon child protection: supportive anti-bullying programs, SafeZones (which is demonstrated by Safe Zone markings), andGay-Straight Alliances, known as GSAs. Although every oneof them is critical for students, Sadowski suggests thatteachers strive for even greater inclusion through activitieslike integrated syllabuses, effective psychological well-beingstrategies, and enhanced career advancement. The audience issubsequently guided by a slew of examples highlighting specificservices, educational institutions, and regions in which LGBTQintegration extends past basic security concerns. All contexts arevividly depicted with the use of an incredibly simple narrationformat. The audience is further directed to an index thatcontains the complete list of resources employed in a variety ofexamples. On the whole, the book concisely illustrates instancesof educational institutions moving past sheer security for LGBTQstudents, while also introducing services which can be utilizedby a broad range of academic staff, such as teachers, supervisors,student groups, and campus psychological support specialists(such as curriculums for a Common Core-compliant LGBTQintegrated course, and an overview of an LGBTQ academictherapy community). Context details are presented in a concisemanner. Sadowski begins by defining the term LGBTQ (lesbian,gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning), followed by ashort section explaining why this word was chosen. He furtherdebunks many myths of bisexual and transgender rejection inLGBTQ literary works.NPR commonly employs the term LGBT to apply toindividuals that identify as “lesbian, gay, bisexual, ortransgender.” Sadowski prefixes “queer” with a “Q.” Thisstudy does the same thing. Sadowski’s book contains severalaccounts. He is a specialist in teenage personality formationwith a particular emphasis on students who identify asLGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer).Sadowski interviewed teaching staff across the United Statesto discover how they are incorporating LGBTQ-friendlystrategies into their institutions’ syllabuses and environments.Sadowski also attacks tactics which include protection asthe ultimate target. Safety is a crucial aim, and he describesit as “a critical baseline from which all subsequent workmust follow.”“Safe is not enough: Better schools for LGBTQ students”should be studied by both teachers and education administratorsand should be used in college learning and social servicepractice. Indeed, considering the increasing prominence ofLGBTQ individuals as involved (Chan, 2021a), valued, andvisible fellow citizens, this book is especially importantsince it addresses the causes and consequences of LGBTQdiscriminatory practices (Chan, 2021c). I definitely appreciate itbecause it promotes community cohesion and inclusion in theacademic environment.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe author confirms being the sole contributor of this work andhas approved it for publication.REFERENCESChan, A.

LGBT students experiencebullying, such as violent acts, alienation, ridicule, or even death threats, leading to a sense ofinsecurity, skipped learning time, and lower likelihood of educational excellence (Santos et al.,2020). LGBT adolescents are more likely than anyone to attempt suicide as a result of suchharassment in school environments. The issue is addressed in this text (Tilley et al., 2020). Thisrelatable and simple book directs instructors, educators, leaders, and school personnel towardeffective and validated approaches to establish positive academic settings, adjust educationalpolicies, improve syllabuses, and more successfully serve LGBT+ adolescents while they study, byspelling out guiding principles and providing expert advice for fostering LGBT+ inclusive learningin classrooms.This book, which includes actual experiences and examples, a checklist, and additional materials,allows experts across a wide range of educational disciplines to incorporate basic principles intotheir daily encounters with learners, parents, and colleagues in order to foster a general learningatmosphere that cultivates a supportive, inclusive, and accepting community for everyone. Thisbook might be seen by observers, administrative groups, as well as the whole school districts aspart of their lessons. Shane offers a powerful framework for K-12 teachers in this text. Her bookis a helpful resource for students and staff looking to increase cultural awareness and incorporateguiding principles that benefit LGBT+ learners, households, and employees.Shane teaches people how to avoid discriminating against LGBT+ individuals in variouscontexts. She specifies expressions, examines the significance of acceptable and offensive words,and discusses how to talk compassionately to and about LGBT+ individuals. Shane gives astraightforward, concise description of social status and power dynamics in an objective waythat piques people’s interest in further examining the issue. Hence, Shane offers examplesinvolving people and their circumstances. Such events are based on actual events which occur86Chan Book Review: LGBT+ Inclusionin school districts and frequently frustrate inexperiencedteachers. Shane propose a new strategy, encouraging people toview the events from the point of view of individuals, decision-makers and district authorities, and from the angle of theestablished practices and guidebooks used by school districts. Shesubsequently offers a “Guidance” chapter about every case, whichincludes LGBT+ good practices criteria.The final portion of this text attempts to put information intopractice. It offers teachers advice and guidance for recognizingtheir capabilities and creating a strategy to tackle locations inwhich their culture has been developing. Shane also providestemplate emails to communicate with a principal or districtleader in order to initiate a dialogue about transition. Sheoffers a comprehensive appendix with a wealth of toolsfor teachers, such as texts for learners across all levelsof education. Such tools and tactics lay the groundworkfor campaigning.Shane’s book is a great resource for students and staff. Schoolcounselors, student volunteers, and human services mentors whoare training new groups of social workers can obtain valuablematerial to meet the demands of LGBT+ learners, households,and schools. Shane’s book, which was influenced by her owndoctoral experiences in education and public assistance, servesas a basis for counselors to interact with academic contexts.This information could be adopted by social workers to educateeducators, supervisors, and school officials. The material may beutilized in organized lectures or reading groups to progress onthe possible circumstances and develop improvement strategies.With case studies, the events offer a deeper level of understandingof micro-level approaches. Within those obstacles, many schoolcounselors would identify themselves as well as respectiveschool districts. More importantly, Shane offers a chance forcampaigning and analysis on mezzo-macro approaches whichcould alter school culture.Years back, the LGBT+ group was marginalized, but now,the LGBT+ population is demanding equal rights. Religion andtradition have a significant impact on all individuals, and theirviewpoint on LGBT+ is accepted by the general public. TheLGBT+ culture is one-of-a-kind, and often people fail to realizethat these individuals are far more valuable than they historicallyassumed. Several approaches are not directly applicable toLGBT+ individuals (Chan, 2021). For example, in an educationalsetting, LGBT+ children sometimes encounter verbal or physicalabuse and humiliation. LGBT+ learners are more vulnerable tounfavorable academic consequences when faced with substantialchallenges such as bullying, violence, and the absence of goodexamples to follow. Nonetheless, LGBT+ learners have to haveallies. Inclusion, dignity, affection, and thoughtfulness must beupheld in educational institutions. This text, I presume, will assistpolicymakers in developing a more accepting school atmospherefor LGBT+ learners. Building a positive atmosphere for LGBT+learners enhances learning results among all students besidesthose who are classified as LGBT+. This text may put a spotlighton the despair of the marginalized LGBT+ community and theunreasonable rejection of them within the academic context.Therefore, ongoing development in the field is obviously requiredto guarantee that every single student is seen as having theright to an education that is pleasant, inclusive, and devoidof discrimination, and that LGBTQ-inclusive education is anintegral component in building those environments (Chan,2021).Eventually, Shane’s book, The Educator’s Guide toLGBT+ Inclusion: A Practical Resource for K-12 Teachers,Administrators, and School Support Staff, provides a chancefor counselors to assist school environments via a thoughtfulframework of rationality and practice for building morepositive academic cultures for LGBT+ individuals. To achievea meaningful and comfortable life, it is important to maintainself positive mental health (Chan et al., 2021). This book oughtto be read by all educators and school leaders, and it mustbe part of the curriculum in undergraduate education andcommunity services training. This text is particularly significantas it discusses the roots and effects of LGBTQ discrimination.I highly recommend it since it advocates the concept of socialinclusion in the educational system.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe author confirms being the sole contributor of this work andhas approved it for publication.REFERENCESChan, A.

This paper examines theintersections of straight allies in promoting an LGBTQ visibility and agency in Australiansecondary schools. Drawing on interviews with “straight”-identified secondary students,a narrative methodology was utilized to explore the presence of student allies for makingsafe schools. Drawing on straight secondary students’ responses to LGBTQ issuesin their schools, firsthand accounts of intervening in heteronorming school culturesfocus on experiences of being an ally to address LGBTQ inclusivity in Australiansecondary schools.Keywords: secondary school, Australia, school culture, LGBT, allyINTRODUCTIONThe problematic nature of social and academic participation in school communities for lesbian, gay,bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) youth often involves how stigmatizing relational dynamicsbecome the dominant narrative during the compulsory years of schooling Callingham, 2018.However, as attitudes and expressions toward (homo)sexuality are being increasingly influenced byand connected to wider discourses happening beyond the school gates, the increased representationof sexual identities in the public domain suggests the significance of popular culture in peer culturesfor providing teachable moments about LGBTQ lives. Dyer (1992, p. 161) notes how, “It is withinculture that homosexual identities are formed,” and as sexual diversity is increasingly made visiblein mainstream popular culture, the presence of LGBTQ identity, it could be argued, is increasinglyqueering the quotidian. The diaspora of queer characters flowing off the screen into living roomsis, as Eng (2003, p. 4) notes, “providing new ways of contesting traditional. . . kinship structures ofreorganizing. . . communities based on the assumption of a common set of social practices.” Theemergence of the “new” pro-gay as a performative construction (Gorman-Murray, 2013, p. 222)is illustrated in the recent Canadian TV sitcom Schitt’s Creek, which received critical acclaim andcommunity praise for its representation of inclusion. Sexual diversity is introduced with the initiallypansexual/gay character of David Rose, who as he goes about his everyday business, representsthe normalization of homosexuality in a community that articulates new discursive configurationsof embodying a pro-gay straight identity. This re-textualization, we suggest, not only queers thedisciplining spaces of everyday life, but could be read an illustration of “acts of activism. . .within‘everyday’ places” (Hickey-Moody and Haworth, 2009, p. 80).The notion of re-/textualization as a pedagogical context started us thinking about howgay–straight alliances and associations among youth in schools offer up “spaces of possibilityfor new kinds of action, new kinds of learning, and newly emergent subjectivities” (Mayo, 2017,88Vicars and Van Toledo Walking the Talkp. 1). We started to wonder about how being an LGBTQally could be read as “acts of activism [for interruptinghomophobia]. . .within ‘everyday’ places” and what that couldmean within Australian school communities (Vibert and Shields,2003; Jones and Hillier, 2012). Does the presence of LGBTQ alliesin schools interrupt narratives of the sexual “norm” and createthe space to be different?In Kjaran’s (2017) study of heteronormativity in Icelandic highschools, the reproduction of the sexual norm was explained by agay participant in terms of howThe kids at school talk very openly about their sex life [ofheterosexual students] and of others and it was expected that I didthe same. I couldn’t do this, I couldn’t participate in this kind ofdiscussion, and I felt therefore somehow different, like I was lessvalued as a man (Kjaran, 2017, p. 99).Being is, as Barker (1989) notes, a transforming relation andis often “a mode of response to the very forms of powerthat each day reproduces it” (p. 88). Being is invariably adialogic experience, and in this paper, our thinking about beingan LGBT ally was framed by the effects of intra-action forre-textualizing the everyday spaces of schools. Our aim inthis paper is to consider the interruption of microflows ofheterosexism and homophobia by “straight”-identified LGBTQallies in Australian secondary schools, and guiding our enquirywas our interest in hearing insider experiential accounts ofaffirming LGBTQ sexuality in Australian high schools. There arefew documented narratives of straight-identified allies, and asnarrative researchers, we are naturally drawn to stories aboutpeople and their place in the world. It has been discussed thatnarratives about people and their lives act “as both a meansfor knowing and a way of telling about the social world”(Bochner, 2001, p. 155), and we purposefully decided to keepthe investigation broad. In doing so, we invited the participantsto reflect on and retell their lived experiences of encounteringand resisting heteronormative and homophobic expressions intheir school communities. We were cognizant that the storieswe were going to be told would not purely be concerned withthe self and considered the participant narratives as not onlybiographical accounts of life events, but also as interpretationsthat communicated “a way of understanding and analyzing, theinvolvement of self with others within their combined discourses”(Chang, 2008).In starting to think about the axiomatic, regulatory normsof the pedagogy of social and cultural practices in educationaldomains, we acknowledge how heterosexism and homophobiaare all too often tacitly institutionalized at the macro level inAustralian schools (Cumming-Potvin and Martino, 2018) and,as a narrativizing practice, the importance of addressing thewider sociocultural conditions in which this study is located arenow addressed.IT AIN’T NO MARDI GRAS HERE: A (BRIEF)AUSTRALIAN CONTEXTIt is difficult to provide a “grand” narrative of homosexuality inAustralia due to the geographical and legislative differences thatcharacterize federation. It is a notable feature of the Australiancontext how changes in legislation have followed a change inpublic attitudes toward homosexuality, but these attitudes havevaried widely from state to state. Contextualizing the legislativevariances to which LGBTQ individuals have been subject makesit possible to understand the checkered history of homosexuallaw reform and experience in Australia. In 1973, Australiadecriminalized consensual homosexual acts that took place inprivate domains; however, it took 22 years for all Australian statesto enact the repeal with Tasmania being the last state to removesexual acts between consenting adults as a criminal offense in1997 (Power, 2011; Willet, 2013). Positive attitudinal shifts acrossAustralia toward homosexuals did not advance uniformly orwere widespread, and a further reinforcement of the Australiangovernment’s staunch antihomosexual stance was made easier inthe 1980s due to the pervading presence of the HIV virus, whichhad started to permeate amoral panic narrative within Australiansociety. Gaymen, specifically, during this decade were universallyrepresented by the media as “AIDS carriers” responsible forthe infection of “innocent” heterosexual people through theirreckless sexual activity (Lupton, 1999, p. 51). This moral panicreflected public sentiment and was echoed in the rise of vigilanteantigay groups, who took to the streets and “gay bashing” as aform of retribution (Robinson et al., 2014; Schenkel, 2017). Moralpanic and fear-mongering by religious groups and conservativesectors of the media called for a return to Victorian-era valuesand strict adherence to biblical notions of chastity and fidelity.In 1993, the gay panic defense was called into question inMudgee, New South Wales, when Malcolm Green murderedDonald Gillies because he alleged that he entered his bedroomnaked and made sexual advances toward him. In the ensuinglegal battle Green was found guilty of manslaughter, a reducedconviction, due to what his defense team argued as reasonableprovocation. The Honorable Justice Kirby, an openly gay man inthe judiciary, was only one of three sitting judges to dispute thefinding and warned of the implications of such a decision. Heremarked that, in a heterosexual case of a similar nature, such anexcuse for violence would be unacceptable.Legislative battles around the issue of homosexuality emergedonce again in the Australian public domain in 2004with the battlefor the legalization of gay marriage. Debated by a predominantlyheterosexual Australia, the argument garnered divisive mediacommentary. The then Prime Minister of Australia, JohnHoward, declared that the institution of marriage was a sanctitythat could only take place between a man and a woman. Theidea of legally recognized same-sex relationships for conservativeheterosexuals, according to Edwards (2007), attacked the coreof idealized notions of masculinity and patriarchy and createdfear that both could become redundant. In 2017, 61.6% ofthe Australian population voted affirmatively for gay marriage;however, the debate that preceded the ruling was unrelentingand damaging with many LGBTQ individuals reporting “stigma-related stress” as a result of homophobic reporting, advertising,and discussion (Ecker et al., 2019, p. 213). Nadal et al.(2010) study the effects on the LGBTQ community during theAustralian gay marriage plebiscite and report that interpersonalmicroaggression, which refers to day-to-day forms of subtle orunconscious discrimination often articulated in language, wasFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61100189Vicars and Van Toledo Walking the Talkheightened during the lead up to the vote (Perales and Todd,2018). The detrimental effect on LGBTQ people was describedby a participant in the Chonody et al. (2020, p. 58) study, whosaid, “This postal farce has done nothing but erode the Australianpeople’s sense of community and turn what were once friendlyneighbors against one another.”As Australian public attitudes on homosexuality vary fromstate to state, legislation continues to be produced that hasthe potential to diminish the lives of LGBTQ people. In 2013,the federal government passed the Sexual Orientation, GenderIdentity, and Intersex Status Amendment Act with an exemptionthat continues to allow religious schools and organizations todiscriminate based on sexual orientation. In 2019, in Queensland,the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 2019 (QLD) was passedby a narrow majority. Although this legislation prohibits shocktherapy treatments for LGBTQ youth, it does not ban conversiontherapy that takes place outside of healthcare domains. Despitesmall legislative wins, there continues to be policy presented toparliament designed to impede the rights of LGBTQ people. In2020, Mark Latham, the ex-leader of the Australian Labor partyand the current New SouthWales leader of the One Nation Party,introduced the Education Legislation Amendment (ParentalRights) Bill 2020 (NSW), which, if instated, will prohibit theteaching of gender fluidity in schools across the state of NewSouth Wales.The regulation of schools in matters pertaining to sexualityhas had a powerful and long-lasting impact and has shapedthe formulation and adoption of educational cultures inAustralia. Reading the regulation of sexuality from a criticallyqueer perspective can reveal what lies beneath the surface ofeveryday discourse and leads us to consider how compulsoryheterosexuality, a pervading feature of the psyche in Australianculture, is situated in Australian educational domains (Martinoand Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2001).WHAT LIES BENEATH: LGBT INAUSTRALIAN SCHOOLSThe promotion of normative sexuality in the Australianeducational domains offers a framework of legitimacy thatinevitably produces symbolic andmaterial exclusion as evidencedin 1979 with the then Victorian Minister of Educationmemorandum that was sent to all schools in the state orderingprincipals not to stock any books or materials that encouragedor promoted homosexuality (Marshall, 2014). Ferfolja (2007, p.148) writes how in “Australia, Western discourses of childhoodprevail, constructing youth as innocent, vulnerable, asexual,unknowing, in need of protection from moral turpitude, andin binary opposition to adults.” Epstein et al. (2002) arguethat this notion of “innocence” was developed as a way ofmaintaining power of authority over and ignorance of sexualbehavior and identity, and as young people traverse the corridorsof school, the regulation of matters pertaining to sexualitybecomes subject to the panoptic gaze and interpellations ofmoral entrepreneurs. Surveillance and regulation have meantthat the expression of sexuality when conjoined with youngpeople continues to be considered as a dangerous form ofknowledge in school settings and to be the target of political,social, educational, and legal regulations (Epstein and Johnson,1998). Although it should be noted that, despite changingattitudes in society at large, little headway has been made inproducing more positive and engaging educational experiencesfor LGBTQ students in Australian school domains. Even thoughthe study of sexuality in Australian educational domains hasa relatively recent history (Rasmussen, 2004, 2006; Martinoand Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2011; Lea et al.,2014; Ullman, 2015; Grant et al., 2021), educational researchthroughout the 1990s and 2000s consistently demonstrates howLGBTQ+ youth in Australian schools were at risk, with suicidalbehavior and self-harm tendencies at disproportionate levels totheir heterosexual peers (Castro and Sujak, 2014). The Hillieret al. (2010) study of LGBTQ+ youth in Australian schoolsdemonstrates and documents the urgent need for an inclusiveand focused curriculum to support the needs of LGBTQ+students and their friends, and research continues to indicatethe incidence of negative experiences for Australian LGBTQ+students (Loutzenheiser, 2015).Although a comprehensive critical examination of the powerand effect of heteronormativity in Australian schools remainsunaddressed, counternarratives are emerging (Marshall, 2011;Ullman, 2015; Jones and Hillier, 2016; Ward, 2017; Jones, 2020).However, when steps are taken toward a progressive and inclusiveapproach to teaching and learning, they are usually short-lived,and in 2010, in the Australian state of Victoria, the Safe SchoolsCoalition was formed and implemented Australia-wide in 2013.The program aimed to provideProfessional development for school staff;Guidance and support for teachers around specific issuesand concerns or for schools to support individual studentsupon request;Printed and digital approved resources for teachers thatprovide the information and tools to respond to bullyingand discrimination;Support to ensure the school’s curriculum and practices areinclusive to students who are same sex attracted, genderdiverse, or intersex;Support for schools in reviewing or introducing antibullying ordiversity policies to be safer and more inclusive.(http://www.safeschoolscoalition.org.au/from-a-safe-schools-coalition-australia-ssca-spokesperson-6) (Safe SchoolsCoalition Australia, 2020).However, a backlash by Australian conservative groups putpressure on the program’s funded viability and contributed to thesubsequent withdrawal of it as a national program in 2016.It is not the aim of this paper to provide a detailed accountof the literature that addresses LGBTQ inclusion/exclusion inAustralian schools, but to set the scene for what Ferfolja (2007)argues: how heterosexuality is privileged in many aspects ofcurriculum although non-normative sexualities are tacitly hiddenand framed as the “educational other” (Slee, 2013).At an individual level, the category of educational othercomprises students who are disenfranchised and marginalizedFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61100190Vicars and Van Toledo Walking the Talkwithin schools through social divisions and hierarchies of worth(Gergen and Dixon-Roman, 2014). At a systemic level, theeducational other is routinely perpetuated by an educationsystem that inscribes narrow conceptions of what schoolingis and does. Othering has a primeval genealogy, which canmake belonging a tricky path to navigate. De Beauvoir (2010,p. 26) writes that “no group ever defines itself as One withoutimmediately setting up the Other opposite itself; and Othernessis therefore, bound by power relations where the ‘known andunknown’ are set apart and cast as opposites” (Creutz-Kämppi,2008, p. 297). The reductive action of “othering” habituallyinvolves a linguistic interpellation of difference, and Guralnikand Simeon (2010, p. 407) discuss how interpellation is “thevery mechanism through which ideology takes hold of theindividual [and is] the authoritative voice of the State [that]recognizes the individual and hails him into social existence”while simultaneously casting out the other. This interpellationof deficit and the development of a pejorative nomenclaturefunctions as a means of division and boundary making, of “themfrom us.” Rothmann and Simmonds (2015) study of preserviceeducation students demonstrates how the use of linguistic toolsobjectify LGBTQ identities and maintain the separation between“them” and “us.” Participants in their research consisted offourth-year education students who were given a fictitiousscenario that centered around teaching LGBTQ students despitebeing religiously opposed to the idea. The participants’ collatedresponses demonstrated that a large proportion used objectifyingterms, such as “it,” “things,” “stuff,” “they,” “issue,” and “them,”in relation to LGBTQ+ people, and the lack of intersubjectiveconnection emphasized the focusing on differences rather thanthe intersections of connectedness (Okolie, 2003).If, as we suggest, essentialist notions of sexuality andgender are strongly interwoven into the fabric of Australianschool life, then these become the structures that support howheteronormativity becomes institutionalized. The processes andculture that keep it in operation are tacitly understood by thosewho inhabit and reify the “norm in a country in which, it couldbe argued, the derogatory ‘poofter,’ is the preferred interpellationof stigma that brings a weighted pressure to conform to andperform cis-gendered heterosexuality” (Dowsett, 2003). Studiesthat have mapped a social geography of homophobia identifylocations within schools where heteronormative practicesare most frequently and aggressively prosecuted. Pejorativeschoolyard jokes and jibes about “queers” habitually inculcateheteronormative scripts (Ellis and High, 2004; Vicars, 2005,2008a). Rofes (1995) indicates how words such as “poofter, gay,queer, homo, lezzy” are highly meaningful in that they continueto constitute what is and is not considered “normal” within dailyschool life and peer culture, andWoodford et al. (2013) notes thecausal relationship of hearing heterosexist language and feelingsof social isolationIt goes without saying that LGBTQ lives are made up ofa finite number of crucial interactions, and the significanceof interpersonal relationships within social networks extend aninfluence on how individuals think about themselves and theirpeers. Putnam (2004) suggests the connections of individuals inand between groups can be substantially beneficial to members.Cassity and Gow (2006, p. 44) find that the biggest challenge forall secondary students was to “seek out a community to whichthey could safely belong,” and for LGBTQ students, this can stillbe a troublesome task. Grant et al. (2021, p. 2) note the “dearthof Australian research exploring the impact of LGBTQ studentgroups on school cultures,” and this may well be to the emergentnature of such groups in Australia. To the best of our knowledgeat the time of writing, there is only one gay–straight alliancereported in operation in Australia, and it started in 2016 at aVictorian Grammar school.ALLYSHIP: WHAT IS IT? WHAT DOES ITMEAN?Schooling can often be a rite-of-passage milestone for LGBTQstudents in which they get read as dislocations in the normativediscourses of practice (Robinson et al., 2014). For many of us, theexperience of being the gay kid, the gay student, the gay sibling,the gay friend is drawn from the vagaries of our encountersand interactions and is shaped by the verities of existence. Wehave written elsewhere how the most powerful parts alwaysgo to heterosexual protagonists for reinforcing or resisting theheteronormative script in everyday life:Throughout my childhood and into my adolescence, I becameaccustomed to not making sense. Having a growing awareness ofnot being straight enough, involved me rethinking “I” in relation tothe wider communities in which I sought belonging. I am conscioushow I am/was often perceived as being “too gay” which invariablymeans being “too queeny,” “too flamboyant,” “too visible” (Vicars,2012, p. 55).I began to realize that my brother was not like the other boys that Ihad encountered as soon as I entered the institution of school. Mybrother refused to accept the binary social enforcement of gender.He expressed himself in a socially taboo manner rejecting shades ofcolor and clothing which we had been taught from a young age weresuitable for boys. He learned ballet, enjoyed the theater of “dressingup” and refused to play the “holy” sport of football. He was subjectedto taunts, physical harassment and societal disapproval. My brotherwas a minority residing in a town which displayed disapprovaland in many cases overt loathing toward his determination andinclination to self-express and be gender fluid. As his sibling, I alsobecame victim to this treatment (Van Toledo, 2018, p. 113).Although Tillmann-Healy (2001) research into gay and straightfriendships and Gorman-Murray’s (2013) study on gay–straightfriendships demonstrate the power of proximity and situatednessfor enacting attitudinal change and advocating for LGBTQ issues,it would, we suggest, also have an effect on how allies positionthemselves within their existing social networks (Smith, 2015).Being visible as an ally, it seems, is not only an act of world re-/making, but also of self re-/making. The participants in theirstories speak of how their adoption of an ally role was constructedthrough daily school experiences and involved a conscioustaking-up of a positionality/identity in specific moments and inencounters with others (Grzanka et al., 2015). A couple of theparticipants spoke of how often this could be a balancing actbetween providing support, interrupting stigmatizing behaviors,Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 4 July 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61100191Vicars and Van Toledo Walking the Talkand resisting the suspicion of being queer themselves. These“complex associations” of being an ally of which Mayo (2017)speaks have been suggested to be in the negotiation of straightprivilege and queer exclusion in educational domains. The risksthat come with speaking out affirmatively for LGBTQ peers is, asMayo (2017, p. 121) notes, appearing in “contexts or are knownto publics in ways they cannot control,” and perhaps the mosttelling difference between being an ally for LGBTQ peers andformal gay–straight alliances is in the formal and institutionalizedstructure that supports and scaffolds the latter.Studies that examine the impacts of gay–straight alliancesattest to the positive impacts on academic performance andsocial well-being their presence has in schools (Kosciw et al.,2010; Walls et al., 2010; Toomey et al., 2011; Smith et al.,2014; Poteat et al., 2015; Baams et al., 2020; Lessard et al.,2020a,b), and although there are resource materials on how tobe an ally, there is a paucity of scholarship on the experienceof being a straight ally. Grzanka et al. (2015), in examining theconcept and identities of straight LGBTQ activism, sought tounderstand how “a straight ally identity is produced in the socialworlds of those who identify as allies and how they came tothis identity by way of interactions” (p. 166). The study notesthe misleading conflation of being a straight ally with LGBTQactivism and advances a consideration of how straight allyship“represented a form of identity choreography, that was bothdeeply affective and intricately intentional” (p. 177). Coining theterm “identity choreography as way to think through (1) howindividuals integrate meanings and knowledge from otherwisediscreet social orders, (2) how those meanings are anchored inpersonal, self-reflexive narratives about identity,” (p. 177) thestudy notes that the category of ally “should not be renderedmonolithic or singular in either form or content” (p. 179) but iscontoured as Valentine (2000, p. 257) notes,“within the context of peer group culture highly embodiedand [for young people] predicated on adult notions ofheterosexualized gender identities.”As each of the participants’ told their experiential stories ofwhat often lies beneath and beyond the macro surface of schooland is seldom immediately visible to the teacher or educationalresearcher, the instrumental complexities of taking up of an allypositionality was routinely located in the participants’ relationalinteractions with others.METHODOLOGYFour participants, three females aged between 15 and 21 andone male aged 16, were snowball sample recruited from withina friendship group and a colleague’s young adult family member.The defining characteristics of the sample were the participants’pro-gay views, concerns that negative attitudes toward LGBTQstudents were becoming further entrenched in their schools,and how school operations and processes did not meet theneeds of LGBTQ students. All of the participants had LGBTQ-identified friends and were already invested in being an ally.They all shared a set of ideological beliefs and values that standagainst the heteronormative cultures in school. The participantsall came from middle-class backgrounds and had attended orwere attending independent selective high schools/selective stategrammar schools. They were invited to participate in a 20-minrecorded Viber interview, and the purpose of the interview wasto identify themes connected to the participants’ perceptions andviews of what it meant for them to publicly identify and be aLGBTQ ally. The participants were not asked to respond to anexplicit research question but were invited to reflect on theirschool experiences connected to LGBTQ-identifying students. Atthe start of the interview, the participants were invited to telltheir stories from their own perspective. They were informed thatthe interview would be recorded and edited into a grammaticallycorrect version and represented verbatim.The small-scale sample of participants was a deliberate partof the study’s design, which had the aim to convey rich,thick, detailed “ethnographic miniatures” of lived experiences(Geertz, 1973, p. 318). The interviews drew upon the biographic-narrative interpretive method approach (Wengraf, 2001) todraw out narratives from a participant’s own cultural andemotional perspectives. We purposefully chose to move awayfrom the structured interviewing format due to how questionsthat are devised by the researcher often come from assumptionsabout what participant’s lives might be like (Jones, 2003). Wewere aiming to gain insight into the unique experiences andpositionality of participant’s lives in their own words and fromtheir own perspectives (Jones, 2003; Bochner, 2012), and as St.Pierre (2021, p. 6) suggests, “The concept data collection is itselfproblematic because it points to an ontology that assumes dataare separate from human being and so can be ‘collected.”’Working from an “ethics of care” (Glen, 2000), we explainedto the participants the interpretative naturalistic purpose andscope of the interviews as a context for them to speak freely.To ensure anonymity of the participants and their school, anyidentifying details were changed and pseudonyms utilized. Aswith any research interview, consideration of power dynamicsand consent are an abiding issue but are especially importantwhen conducting research with young people (France, 2004;Mishna et al., 2004; Morrow, 2008). We were mindful of thepower dynamics in play that are created by the binaries ofadult/child, researcher/participant and that the something atstake in research inquiry (Smith, 2001, p. 5) can often be“the participant.”Noting the importance of the ethics of representation, Stanley(1993, p. 43–50) suggests how the “’autobiography’...of thesociologist becomes epistemologically crucial no matter whatparticular research activity we are engaged in” and in declaringour “position” as queerly situated educational researchers, wemade it clear to the participants how our personal experience wasinforming our professional interests (Vicars, 2006). Blackman(2016) notes that researchers often feel that they must maintainan outsider’s perspective by not revealing their own personaland emotional connections within research, but we believe suchan ontologically situated approach can usefully problematizethe research process. Sparkes (1996) and Young (2012) advisethat researchers should not be afraid to reveal themselves,their experiences, or investments within their work. SharingFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61100192Vicars and Van Toledo Walking the Talkour beliefs and values with the participants, some might argue,presents a problematic bias, but as Sandelowski (1991) notes, theinterconnectedness of the stories of participant and researcherrooted in the subjectivities of both works toward building rapportand ease between the interviewer and interviewee and lie at thecore of ethical interviewing.Although Coffey (1999, p. 133) notes, that there remainsconsiderable debate over the degree to which autobiographical“texts should represent the field, the self or both,” we set out withthe conviction that a “truth” would be told (Sikes, 2000, 2009,2010). Stories we suggest are interpretations of the world thatrequire an audience to make its own meaning, and throughoutthe interviews, the importance of participant and researcherrelationality and positionality to the issues affecting LGBTQstudents in high school domains became a telling relation.ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKSikes (2001) points out how stories told are subject to time,place, and personal involvements, but so too is interpretation,and in analysis, we drew upon the framework of queer theoryfor thinking about how identity and subjectivity becomesmaterialized and inscribed within social encounters and forunderstanding how ways of being are made visible withinintricate relations with others and are sites of identity formation,self-definition, and affiliation.In analysis, we utilized the trope of the rhizome from which tounderstand the significance of interpersonal relationships withinsocial networks for countering LGBTQ microaggressions. Weendeavored to understand how the participants subjectivitiesas allies were negotiated by being “embedded in webs ofrelationships with others” (Davies, 2015, p. 680). The rhizomethat has been suggested is:unlike a structure, which is defined by a set of points andpositions, with binary relations between the points and biunivocalrelationships between the positions, the rhizome is made only oflines: lines of segmentarity and stratification as its dimensions(Deleuze and Guattari, 1987, p. 21).It proved useful for addressing the problems inherent withspeaking out of a cultural context and positionality and affordeda means for acknowledging location. The participants in theirstories narrated howmeaning emerges not from the thing-in-itself but from itsrelationships to an infinite. . . number of things. In this complexitywe understand from another angle that there is no. . . .finalmeaning of anything; meanings are always evolving in light ofnew relationships. . . new horizons (Kincheloe, 2011, p. 214).The rhizome, as St. Pierre (2021, p. 4) notes, is “deliberatelyanti-method” but useful for “reorientating thought,” and inthe following stories, the participants addressed how their allybehaviors were contoured between the problems of individualexpression connected to their participation in the wider schoolcommunity. Their stories are of interpersonal relationships andsocial networks and in the telling show the gestalt involved in theexpression of being an LGBTQ ally.WALKING THE TALK: DOING SEXUALDIVERSITY AS AN EVERYDAY THINGSophie, a 21-year-old university student studying a postgraduatedegree in arts, had attended both a mixed-gender public highschool and a selective high school in predominantly middle-class,affluent suburbs. Reflecting back on the differences in attitudesbetween the schools, she spoke of how,at my local public high school, any thing to do with being gay wasn’tdiscussed, and it was a derogative thing to be called, but I changedschools in year 10 and went to a selective all-girls school, and it wasso different—there were these lesbian couples openly dating. Therewas a group called SSFYF: Same sex attracted youth and friendsthat was held once a week after school. It was kinda like a supportgroup, and they had a display board in school where they wouldpost stuff. Being at single-sex school was a very different experience;it was much more open and more switched on to LGBT issues.At school assemblies, they talked about being gay and about theimportance of being out.Coloring all of this was that, in our school, there were some openlygay teachers, and this made the environment feel more diverseand accepting. There was this one teacher who presented as verymasculine. She was quite androgynous, and we loved her as shewas quite active in changing the school attitude toward LGBT.The school was very supportive in terms of allowing student gay–straight clubs and societies and publicly talking about LGBTQ issuesand getting the message across to everybody in the school. Therewere a few people that had come out as Trans, and in a single-sexschool, that could have been an issue, but it really wasn’t. The schoolpopulation were quite switched on, and it wasn’t just LGBTQ issuesthat were being discussed, there were numerous clubs that weretalking about a whole range of issues. There were feminist clubs,climate change clubs—you get the idea?We thought about ourselvesas progressive and powerful women, and we spoke of ourselves asbeing smart women.Attitudes toward LGBTQ were part of a wider ideology that washappening at that school. These were mainly coming from thestudent body, and even though there were examples of it being okaybeing gay or trans, at the same time, I and other people were stillscared. There are a lot of my friends who are now ‘out’ that werenot ‘out’ at school, and I think that is because, at our other schools—the ones we had been to before—people would openly demean gaypeople, and discrimination happened. I think people were waiting itout ‘till they could be sure it was safe. Even though it was acceptedthen, it is not as accepted as it is now. What was happening at theschool was good, but I don’t think it would have changed people’sinherent biases that they had internalized growing-up.People were still unlearning, and in general, the politics of queernesswas changing really quickly at that time—public attitudes werechanging, and there were things that people would say 10 yearsago that are now not acceptable. Programs like Modern Familyhad started when I was in high school, and popular culture wasbecoming quite queer, and all that stuff on the TVwas quite shapinghow people at school were behaving and what they were saying.My learning around gender and sexuality happened mainly infriendship groups at school. My friend transitioned during our finalyear at school. He sent an email around saying he was transitioningFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61100193Vicars and Van Toledo Walking the Talkand that he was changing his name to Paul and could we please usehe/his pronouns and address him as Paul. I was very happy that Iand my friends could show support by using his preferred pronounand you know just being visibly on his side. At the end of year prom,he won the best-dressed guy category at the school ball, which isvoted for by the student body and usually someone’s random datewould win it. This was a real validation for him, and when he wonit, everybody just burst into applause and was genuinely happy forhim. I didn’t really think about showing support for LGBT students,it was something that was not really questioned in my friendshipgroup, it was just something that we did. Why wouldn’t we? Thatwould just have been stupid.Ruth, a 15-year-old, year 9 high school student at a selective fee-paying Melbourne school in an affluent middle-class suburb ofMelbourne initially commented on the “pack mentality” in herschool and how it frames what is and is not possible in counteringhomophobic commentary:When 15-year-olds get in packs, they have the most offensive humorpossible. The more people realize that the things they say can hurtpeople, they might actually look and take a step back and thinkabout their actions. When they are in a big group, they get caughtup in the whole “Oh, when I say this, people laugh” and “this is whateveryone is doing.” Phrases such as “that’s so gay” are gotten awaywith because, when they are called on it, they are like “oh no, it’sa joke—I didn’t mean it.” A lot of my year group kind of decidenot to see the problems that they cause and that are behind whatthey say and whether that means they are promoting stereotypes.Those comments such as “that’s so gay” are really bad if you aregay or struggling with your sexuality or even if you are out. Itreally does matter, and so do rumors. I have had some friends whohave been badly hurt by some antigay stuff that people have said,and you need someone to challenge it. I’m not the only one whodoes that.There are quite a few people in some of the groups I mix with thattake it on as some people they mix with that speak in a derogativeway about the LGBTQ community without even realizing it. It’svery normalized at school, so I feel like the more you can make thatnot normal and call it out, then whenever you do that, it mightactually get in to their heads that it is not alright. There were acouple of people who were friends of mine at first, and then theymade anti-LGBTQ jokes and comments and were watching otherfriends of mine who are constantly watching how some of the boysin our group who are a bit effeminate are doing and what they weresaying. They then make jokes about them. I think being a girl makesit easier, especially in high school, to challenge that as boys are muchmore pressured to appear cool. I’ve always had strong opinions, andever since year 7, I have made my views seen on human rights issuesand that kind of thing. I jokingly got called a “feminazi” as everyonein my year group knows what I do. People know not to make thosekind of jokes—anti-LGBT jokes around me ‘cos if they, they willantagonize me, and then I will say something back. People knowthat I will challenge stuff that is offensive, and ‘cos they are awarethey don’t make those kinds of jokes when I am around. Therehaven’t been any consequences for me speaking out, and there aresome people who have said, since you said X, Y, Z, I have actuallythought about it, and you had a point. One of my friends is out, andshe is not afraid to deal with people if they are being homophobicor sexist. She does get teased but not to her face. . . not many of myyear group would directly say anything. I don’t know if that makes itbetter or worse as the name calling is all very much behind people’sbacks. I have never been bullied for speaking out. Joe, one of myfriends, does a really good job of closing negative stuff down, and hedoes it in a quiet way. He is in a couple of friendship groups, one ofwhich is the jock/sporty group, and there are three individuals thatare seen to lead the charge on saying anti-LGBTQ stuff. Joe saysthings like “Hey, that’s not okay,” or he redirects the conversation.He always takes it on. I am in a friendship group with three gay kids,and they are happy and positive about school. They are quieter thanmy other friends, and they are not in the big circles of kids that hangaround the school. They find the big groups uncomfortable and theysay if they are ever stuck in a situation with a lot of kids they don’tknow or with the jocks that are known to make snide comments,they feel nervous.I don’t think the teachers are good at dealing with comments thatare made and that they hear. It has got to the point where thosekids who say stuff about gay people don’t care because the teachersjust give them a slap on the wrist. Whilst the teachers don’t tendto make it seem like its okay, they might not really know whatto do about it, and they pass it off as if those people are notlaughing about sexuality but something else. They (the teachers)want to look like they are supporting us, but really it’s not anythingmore than them saying, “Don’t say that’s gay, we’re all part of theschool.” Unfortunately, 15-year-olds don’t exactly listen to that.At our campus, the year 9 is split off from the rest of the school,and the main school has got really good stuff going on, but it ismainly student organized, but teachers are supportive of it. Thereare LGBT posters, displays, and on a couple of teacher’s offices, thereare rainbow flags and helpline flyers for LGBT youth. Support onthe main campus is made clear. With social media, Pride monthwas everywhere at school, and a lot of kids know June is Pridemonth. In my age group, everyone knows the rainbow flag is theLGBTQ symbol. During Pride months, we (me and some of myfriends) got rainbow badges that we pinned on to our blazers, andI’ve still got mine on. People I know came up to me and said, “Peoplewill think you are gay with that on your blazer,” and I responded“Is that really such a bad thing?” During Pride month, me and myfriends made a speech at the Year 9 assembly as we realized wehadn’t done anything asa year group to acknowledge Pride month.We wanted to tell our year group what it is about and why peopleshould do something for it. I talked a lot about making sure schoolsare the most comfortable environment given that a lot of us could bequestioning who we like and who we are, and a negative commentcould be detrimental to that. Some people came up to me after theassembly and said they really liked what I had said. The head ofyear 9 came up to me and said that what we had done made heremotional, and quite a few of the teachers congratulated me fororganizing it. Our presentation was positively received, and therewas no gatekeeping by the school. At the main campus, they evenput rainbow flags, and they also had a speech at their assembly. Myyear 10, 11, 12 friends have started an LGBTQ youth support group,and we get together to talk about how the school could be moresupportive. In the older year groups, there is a great communityand a lot more kids are “out.” The year 10–12 teachers are startingto talk with the kids that identify as LGBT1 and are asking themwhat they can do to help. They are saying things like “We want tolearn from you guys.” “What could we do to help more?” My friendSage has started to transition, and everyone in my friendship groupuses her new name and makes a real effort to acknowledge they aregender neutral. Sage’s transition has, on the whole, been positivelyreceived, and no one has questioned her pronouns or anything likethat, but I think that is more due to trans ignorance.Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61100194Vicars and Van Toledo Walking the TalkJoe, a 15-year-old male friend of Ruth’s who attended the sameschool and was in the same year and friendship group, articulatedan experience of how being amale ally is mademore problematic.We have a couple of kids that have come out this year, and so far,the response has been Okay. Nobody gives them direct flack, butbehind the scenes, there is a lot of homophobic remarks made in mysporty friendship group, stuff like “He’s a faggot.” They say it whenthey won’t get caught as nobody wants to be in the direct line offire, they are too scared of being homophobic to those kids’ faces asthey afraid to cop the consequences. I have two friendship groups,the sporty group in which there is a lot of homophobic behavior andthe friendship group, which Ruth is part of. Ruth has kind of rubbedoff on all of us, and we have learnt from her that there is nothingwrong with being gay. In the sporty group, it is harder to challengeas they tend to give shit to people who stand up for gay people, andthey accuse them of being gay too. If you do say something back, itcan get quite dark, so the choice is don’t say anything and go alongwith it or get yourself subjected to verbal slurs. Ruth’s group is totallydifferent, we all have similar beliefs, and it is known around schoolthat it is not cool to say antigay stuff. That group has a vibe aroundschool, and we are tight.Schools could improve by putting the word out more to stophomophobic language as that is so normalized, and I hear it sooften, and it is hard to question it with some people. I feel if teacherstook more of stance, I could have more of an impact by pickingpeople up on what they say, and I should. I would shut people upif I knew someone was gay and they were getting shit in a group. Ihave a responsibility.Nina, a 20-year-old University student who attended a publichigh school in 2017 in an affluent middle-class suburb ofMelbourne commented,I get really offended by homophobia. I don’t understand it—I reallydon’t understand it! There are lots of LGBTQ kids at my school,which is in a progressive suburb, and I think there is a socioeconomicdifference. I don’t know how to say this, but less academic kids tendto use more pejorative language, and I think being gay is more of anissue for them.My school was very accepting, and it celebrated Pride day, whichwas a whole school initiative that tried to make us more literateabout LGBTQ issues. The school wanted LGBTQ students to feelwelcome, and posters were put up around the school, and there wasa special assembly, but it never got introduced in the curriculum, soit never became a learning objective, so it felt a bit like the checkingof boxes.My friends were/are gay, and my best friend was out at school inyear 11/12 and is non-cis. Our friendship group put a lot of effortin to updating the wider school community on the use of pronounsafter they told me they wanted to be addressed as “they/their.” Westarted a campaign to get the school to put in gender-neutral toilets,but they refused, which was so bad. I am cis presenting, and thereis nothing obvious about me that others can latch onto, so I havehad a smooth ride ‘cos I fly under the radar even though I nowidentify as bisexual. I don’t see coming out as being all that usefuleven no, as being queer can get you othered and puts you into otherpeople’s boxes.DISCUSSION—STRAIGHT BUT NOTREGULARThe participant stories show how the taking-up of an allypositionality was representative of a mindset that had much todo with their negotiation of their identities as young adults.Advocating for LGBTQ+ issues and being an ally appearsto be grounded in and affected by the participants’ relationalinteractions with others. Articulating a pro-gay sensibility was,for all of the participants, grounded in a context of a commitmentto social justice issues and embodied speaking back a truthto power. Such a stance bears the features of what Foucault(2001) calls parrhesia, an act of speech that is characterized by acommitment to speak freely with openness and honesty and withcriticality and that has the capacity to cause offense and be a riskyendeavor. Parrhesia as a knowing and telling relation to being inthe world speaks of a deep personal engagement, interaction, andinvestment with the “what” and “how” of the material-discursiveis put to work.Ruth’s comment on the pack mentality in schools echoes Joe’sunderstanding of the personal investment required in counteringhomophobic commentary. She explained how adopting an allystance to refute homophobic discourse required taking up aposition in which it was impossible tomaintain a psychic distanceand detachment from name-calling. Ruth, in her narrative, spokeof herself as a summoned subject: “the self constituted anddefined by its position as respondent” (Ricoeur, 1995, p. 262),which is echoed across the participant’s stories. Ruth explainedhow adopting an ally stance required actively taking up a positionin which it was impossible to maintain a psychic distance anddetachment from name-calling and often involved overcomingof personal discomfort and could incur social consequences.The affective aspect of belonging in and to friendship groupsand how gender determined how being an ally is made easieror more difficult is illustrated in Joe’s reflection. Joe, a youngstraight male, straddled two social groups and spoke of, in thewider school population, how his countering of homophobiccommentary in the dominant sporty group meant he had to bea “quiet ally” for fear of the repercussions. Athanases and Comar(2008, p. 13) note howMuch of the bullying nature of name-calling is tied to power,position, and peer pressure. Language is pragmatic, purposeful,and meaningful—and deeply related to social interactions,to relationship formation. . .Name-calling among youth, forexample, establishes in-group affiliations and is a form of bullyingand aggression often intended to establish a public identity. Boysexhibit more overt direct bullying behaviors than girls [and]Policing gender norms is key, especially in adolescent males’homophobic speech that tends to target other males.Joe’s understanding of being an ally was connected to hisunderstanding of the personal consequences of transgressinghegemonic social and cultural roles aligned with normativeexpressions of gendered sexuality. In all male sport-orientatedsocial groups, Joe had to negotiate separation in the ways that hebelonged, acted, spoke out, and represented himself as a straightFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61100195Vicars and Van Toledo Walking the Talkmale and an ally. His narrative reflection on the complexityof his lived experiences makes material the deconstruction ofthe self as subject caught between the binaries of gay/straight,belonging/not belonging and exposes the contingencies ofidentity and subjectivity (Warner, 1999). To move beyond thesebinaries is always problematic, and his vigilant attendance to howthe self is made problematic was framed by what it is possible tobe and do within the governing structures of peer groups. Ruthcommented on how being a girl makes it easier especially in highschool to challenge that as boys are much more pressured to appearcool and as Seidman (1993, p. 130) note,“The logic of identity is a logic of boundary defining. . . The socialproductivity of identity is purchased at the price of logic of ahierarchy normalization and exclusion.”The importance and centrality of gender as a governing pedagogyin the participants’ stories situate it as a key factor in howbelonging is constituted in peer groups and how it determinesthe ease of taking up of an ally position. It is interesting to notehow Sophie’s experience in a single-sex school provided a verydifferent narrative and indicates avenues for future exploration.Nina raised how socioeconomic differences framed attitudestoward LGBTQ issues in schools and suggested how, withinher mainly middle-class “progressive” suburb, LGBTQ waspositioned by the school as being part of a social justice agenda.All of the participants had attended or were attending fee-paying selective schools in affluent middle-class suburbs, andthe context of class and parental attitudes on the reproductionof and resistance to homophobia has to be considered as anattributing factor.Literature that has examined sociocultural attitudes towardsexual minorities (Adamczyk, 2017; Powell et al., 2017) askswhether family socialization is instrumental to the “formingand norming” of attitudes or if educational attainment wassignificant. People from more progressive backgrounds, it issuggested, can be more likely to affirm a sexual minorityidentity (Schnabel, 2018), and such an assertion suggests thatthe formation of attitudes intersects with other emblematicindicators. The situated sociocultural capital of the participants’home environments was progressive thinking, affluent middleclass in which the average level of parental education wastertiary. If the formation of pro-gay attitudes is situated withinsocial, cultural, and geographical locations, then as (Valentine,2007), notes attitudes toward exclusion/inclusion are informedby and within the intersections of people’s lives and identities.Vicars (2014) understanding of how context, temporality, andpositioning can determine adolescent experiences points towardthe instrumental role that families play in the development andenactment of doing gender and sexuality in childhood. Brandt(2001, p. 12) suggests “how that which is felt internally as‘personal experience’ is intimately connected to the institutionsoutside the self that foster and promote such feelings, and if theparticularities of parenting became a telling relation(ship), thenthe ‘family’ as a site of a discursive set of social practices inevitablyhas to account for the broader social and cultural dynamics inwhich childhood and adolescence gets done” Britzman (1997, p.194). Invested in the discursive reproduction of the traditionalWestern family is the making material of discourses thatdiscipline or not (homo)sexuality as a deficit or risky enterprise.Surtees and Gunn (2010, p. 42) note how “Families routinelyinscribe normative identity work and further research is neededinto how the habits of hearth and home can be an influencingfactor in how social inequalities and injustices are negotiated infamily practices” (Taylor, 2012; Chan and Erby, 2018).Although the influence of individual school profile, suburb,socioeconomic status, and parental educational attainmentcannot be discounted as underlying factors in the formation ofhow the participants came to embody an ally identity, they allindicate how being an ally involved the institutional structuresand teacher’s professional practices. Nina noted that LGBTQneeds to be embedded in school culture and in the teachingand learning curriculum content. She suggested how schoolengagement with LGBTQ could have been done better and thatthe commitment to creating inclusive practices in schools wasmainly occurring in and emerging out of student-led efforts.Joe reinforced the importance of senior leadership criticallyengaging with sexuality related diversity to promote inclusiveenvironments and connected how the macro structures of schoolinfluence what he feels he could achieve as an ally. Ruth remarkedon the importance of effective leadership on LGBTQ issues byteachers and how teachers should be seen to address exclusionarypractices and create an environment and school culture thatensures that discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientationis unacceptable and is challenged. Sophie noted how a lesbianvisibility among staff set a tone for making sexuality equalityvisible that maximized awareness of the presence of genderand sexual diversity in the school and was instrumental inchanging perceptions, hearts, and minds. These perceptions echomuch of the existing research into the importance of effectiveleadership on LGBTQ issues in educational domains (Griffinand Ouellett, 2002; Barnet et al., 2006; Vicars, 2008b; Jean-Marieet al., 2009; Branch et al., 2013; Boyland et al., 2016; Lee, 2020)and highlights the importance of school leaders/teachers makingvisible that which often lies beneath and beyond the surface ofthe everyday business of school. Articulating a counternarrativethat interrupts the silencing is connected to teachers overcomingpersonal discomfort, and the Ezer et al. (2019) study of Australianteachers reports how their participants often expressed feelingconfused and hesitant in dealing with the negative impact ofheteronormativity on LGBTQ students. Payne and Smith (2013,p. 2) note how. . . individuals’ behavior or attitudes create a “negative” schoolclimate where student safety and belonging are threatened.Understanding schools in this way does not account forinstitutional heteronormativity, which is a fundamentalorganizational structure through which schools function and thepeople who occupy school spaces interact with one another.Such experiences can be interrupted when same-sex attractedpeople have a strong community connection (Hanckel andMorris, 2014; Swannell et al., 2016), and such connections canFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 9 July 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61100196Vicars and Van Toledo Walking the Talkdisrupt the discourses and practices of the LGBTQ educationalother (Slee, 2013).In Ruth’s case, she took it upon herself to actively educate heryear group school community, and affirmative visibility has longbeen recognized as important in countering stigma and providinginclusive experiences for LGBTQ youth in schools. Bird andAkerman (2005, p. 24) noted 15 years back how“educational and social interventions aimed at addressing socialexclusion may lead to changes in individual self-concept,increased well-being and more developed social networks.”From the participants’ stories, there has been some movement inthe macro interruptions to the everyday discourses of normalcyin their secondary schools, and this appears to be connectedto the change in discourse beyond the school gates. Sophiereferenced the role that popular cultural representations playedin her friendship group in reference to the wider epistemic shiftsinforming attitudinal changes toward LGBTQ. Ruth describedhow she received teacher support for delivering a year groupassembly to mark Pride month and how the visible display ofLGBT posters and rainbow flags signaled on campus LGBTQsupport. As an index of the changing material reality ofLGBTQ+ visibility Ruth referenced how drawing on LGBTQartifacts from the wider community was an important part inmaximizing awareness of attitudes toward gender and sexualdiversity in schools. Nina spoke of how Pride day became a wholeschool initiative, and the presence of artifacts and celebrationof Pride and LGBT history month the participants expressedwere significant for assisting them to interrupt performatives ofhetero-normalcy and to “provoke a critical social realization” inthe wider school community (Alexander, 2005, p. 411–412).CONCLUDING COMMENTSTo fully understand the complexities of straight-identified youthtaking up an ally position in secondary school communitiesrequires more research. The participants’ stories show the biggestchallenge in enacting allyship and pro-gay transformations intheir schools was as Cassity and Gow (2006, p. 44) note, to“seek out a community to which they could safely belong.”Belonging and the shaping presence of gender appeared tobe central to how they made visible an “ally identity” intheir relationships with LGBTQ friends and normalized sexualdiversity in the wider school domain. Foucault (1977, p. 176)suggest how, “if sexual Otherness is habitually positioned inrelation to what is considered as the norm, and in doing solegitimates the norm as the ideal, normalization becomes one ofthe greatest instruments of power, the power of normalization[that] imposes homogeneity.” The participants’ experiences ofnegotiating friendship, affirmation, and inclusion are messy andare as Cvetkovich (2003, p. 2) notes “. . . connected to otherhistories.” Unearthing a genealogy of allyship is beyond the scopeof this paper, but it would fair to say that being an ally hasbecome a significant and defining moment in the lives of theparticipants. Giroux (1988, p. 292) claimes, “The pedagogicalvalue of resistance lies, in part, in the connections it makesbetween structure and human agency on the one hand andculture and the process of self formation on the other.” Speakingout about the interface of straight culture on queer sexuality,Sedwick (1994, p. 2) notes,“The knowledge is indelible, but not too astonishing, to anyonewith a reason to be attuned to the profligate way this culture has ofdenying and despoiling queer energies and lives. . . Everyone whosurvived has stories about how it was done.”Heteronormativity and homophobia maintain an affirmingpresence in Australia, and in this paper, we have endeavored totell stories that are not usually heard and that we suggest areinstrumental to making visible LGBTQ discourse in Australianschools. The participants pro-gay relational interactions withothers are, we hope, a promise of an emerging change in schoolcommunities and an indication it just might be possible to start tothink of a time when the presence of LGBTQ+ allies in schools’render sexuality-related diversity and inclusion as “fairdinkum”and as “Aussie” as Vegemite.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will bemade available by the authors, without undue reservation.ETHICS STATEMENTThe studies involving human participants were reviewed andapproved by Human Research Ethics Committee, VictoriaUniversity. Written informed consent to participate in this studywas provided by the participants’ legal guardian/next of kin.Written informed consent was obtained from the individual(s)for the publication of any potentially identifiable images or dataincluded in this article.AUTHOR’S NOTEThe contribution this article makes to the academy is in thereflection on how young adults position themselves as alliesin Australian secondary schools to interrupt heteronormativediscourses. The paper suggests how such positioning is contouredby and in social friendship groups, is gendered, classed andconnected to wider social and cultural discourses. Drawingon first hand accounts that describe the experiences ofcountering stigmatizing and heteronormalcy in school domains,the notion of being an ally is contextualized within the widerAustralian landscape of legislative frameworks and attitudinalshifts toward LGBTQ. The article invites the reader to considerthe relationship between the macro and the micro andthe importance of relationality for resisting homophobia insecondary schools.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAll authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectualcontribution to the work, and approved it for publication.Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 10 July 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 61100197Vicars and Van Toledo Walking the TalkREFERENCESAdamczyk, A.

Numerous factors, such as repeatedpatterns of homophobic bullying by classmates and others in school, have been asignificant barrier to achieving this goal. In addition, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,and queer (LGBTQ) adolescents encounter substantial inequality across a broadspectrum of wellbeing and education consequences. Compared with their heterosexualcounterparts, LGBTQ adolescents experience more anxiety, depression, suicidalthoughts, antisocial behavior, poorer academic performance, less school attachmentand protection, and a weaker desire to finish their studies. Such discrepanciesbased on gender and sexuality were linked to more maltreatment encountered byLGBTQ adolescents. It is crucial to recognize the backgrounds and expectations ofLGBTQ adolescents to offer them the best resources. To overcome the inequalityand obstacles faced by these LGBTQ adolescents, it is essential to examinetools and techniques that can be utilized. This study examined the literature thatexplains why society fails to provide enough support to LGBTQ students. Specifically,mechanisms explaining how LGBTQ adolescents interact with others in the learningenvironment and how such discrepancies arise will be examined. Following that,violence and prejudice, which are fundamental causes of psychological problemsamong LGBTQ adolescents, will be explored. This review paper thus providessupportive strategies for schools to develop more inclusive learning environments forLGBTQ adolescents.Keywords: social inclusion and exclusion, discrimination, LGBTQ students, mental health, psychological impactFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 726343101fpsyg-13-726343 April 29, 2022 Time: 9:45 # 2Chan et al. Psychological Wellbeing Among LGBTQ CommunitiesINTRODUCTIONGlobally, schools play an essential role in enabling studentsto acquire college credentials and knowledge, become familiarwith the culture, learn about interpersonal relationships, ideals,and standards, and develop survival skills and expertise abilities(Skovdal and Campbell, 2015). When individuals attend schoolsand colleges and receive a comprehensive education, theirchances in life are improved. The community requires theirexpertise, and they are well equipped to serve it. Given themany roles and advantages of education, school environmentsneed to be protective, stable, inclusive, and pleasant to allstudents to maximize learning opportunities for everyone toguarantee that school goals are met. Regrettably, colleges anduniversities worldwide may not be a safe environment forLGBTQ students, who face intimidation, maltreatment, rejection,and other types of discrimination and exploitation (Poynter andWashington, 2005; Fields and Wotipka, 2020; Kurian, 2020).These experiences lead to agony, distress, and anxiety andcould have a detrimental effect on LGBTQ students’ physical,psychological and educational wellbeing (Mateo and Williams,2020; Mallory et al., 2021).THE CORRELATIONS BETWEENDISCRIMINATION AND MENTAL HEALTHThere are different forms of discrimination, includingverbal abuse, physical aggression, burglaries, accommodationdiscrimination, and sexual assault (Flores A. R. et al., 2020).Adolescents who identify as LGB experience more severe peerharassment and maltreatment than their straight counterparts(Kolbe, 2020). In the United States, 34% of LGB adolescentsexperienced bullying at school in the surveyed year, comparedto 19% of straight adolescents (Johns et al., 2020). It has beenreported that maltreatment of children based on their sexualityhas occurred at an early age, as young as eight and nine years old(Evans-Polce et al., 2020).Proximal minority stressors may negatively affect the lives ofLGBTQ individuals. They include internalized homonegativity,societal exclusion expectancies, and the concealment of one’ssexual identity (Delozier et al., 2020). Individuals who havea greater degree of internalized homonegativity express moreunfavorable sentiments about themselves due to their sexualorientation (Ocasio et al., 2020). Additionally, LGBTQ peoplemay suffer stress or lack self-confidence due to their sexuality(Minturn et al., 2021). Since sexuality can be concealed fromothers and that marginalization of LGBTQ people may notbe immediately apparent throughout most human relationships(Kachanoff et al., 2020), LGBTQ people need to determinewhether, when, how, and to whom they disclose their sexuality(Alonzo and Buttitta, 2019; Lo, 2020). Multiple declarationsof their socially marginalized identities might be required,increasing their stress (Daniele et al., 2020). Substantial evidencesuggests that bisexual youngsters are at an even greater risk ofdeveloping psychological problems than gay/lesbian adolescents(Savin-Williams, 2020), given experiences of stressors associatedwith “double discrimination” (i.e., exclusion from both theheterosexual and LG populations) and dismissal of one’s self-image as “just a phase” (Ramasamy, 2020).It should also be noted that LGBTQ students who identifyas members of other oppressed groups (for example, racialand cultural minorities, non-Christians, and members of thelower class) may face heightened instances of discriminationin educational institutions. According to The Trevor Project’s2019 national study on LGBTQ psychological wellness, 71% ofLGBTQ youngsters encountered prejudice due to gender and/orsexuality. Additionally, two-thirds of the LGBTQ adolescentinterviewees reported that they had been persuaded to altertheir sexuality. A survey found that 78% of transgender andnon-binary adolescents faced prejudice due to their genderand sexuality, while 70% of LGBTQ adolescents experienceddiscrimination against their gender expressions. Another study(Platero and López-Sáez, 2020) found that 58% of transgenderand non-binary adolescents experienced being discouraged fromusing the restroom that matched their gender preference.In addition, study findings indicate that LGBTQ individualsmay have serious psychological issues due to their sexuality. Astudy showed that 39% of LGBTQ interviewees reported activelycontemplating suicide in the surveyed year, a majority of themaged between 13 and 17 (Higbee et al., 2020). An astounding71% of LGBTQ adolescents reported experiencing despair ordepression for no fewer than 14 days during the surveyed year(Higbee et al., 2020). While significant progress has been achievedin terms of LGBTQ inclusion over the previous decade, this polldemonstrates that the LGBTQ community, especially youngermembers, continue to face challenges directed at their sexualidentities (Standley, 2020).CURRENT QUANTITATIVE STUDYThe effects of loneliness, marginalization, and inequality onpsychological health and the assessment of health determinantshave been examined in a number of quantitative studiesconducted with LGBTQ adolescents (Table 1). The prevalenceof suicidal ideation, depression, and drug abuse among LGBTQadolescents is considerably higher than that of their heterosexualcounterparts, highlighting the seriousness and frequency ofLGBTQ adolescents’ experiences of inequalities (Price-Feeneyet al., 2020). It has been found that LGBTQ adolescentshave higher incidences of aggression and victimization aswell as more despair and suicidal behavior. These adolescentsare also more likely to develop psychosocial disorders, suchas alcohol and drug problems and eating disorders (Lannoyet al., 2020). Associations have been established between peervictimization and adverse psychological wellbeing indictors, suchas depression, distress, and suicidal tendencies, along with liquorand drug misuse and compromised academic performance,including reduced school involvement and interruptions toacademic paths (Brown et al., 2020).Quantitative analysis has also centered on definingvulnerability and preventive variables for the psychologicalwellbeing of LGBTQ adolescents, resulting in the establishmentFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 726343102fpsyg-13-726343April29,2022Time:9:45#3Chanetal.PsychologicalWellbeingAmongLGBTQCommunitiesTABLE 1 | Summarizes the findings of several academic trials and their connection with the mental health impacts on LGBT students in review.Authors/Studies Year Country Methods Sample/Participant Prevalence Major psychological impactGrossman et al.(2009)2009 United States Grounded theory n = 31 Age: 15–19 Gender: Male (n = 19, 61%),Female (n = 12, 39%) Sexual orientation: Lesbian(n = 6, 19.4%) Bisexual (n = 12, 38.7%) Gay (n = 8,25.8%) Male-to-female transgender (n = 5, 16.1%)Two themes generated: 1.

Psychological Wellbeing Among LGBTQ Communitiesof mitigation, diagnosis, and recovery guidelines, as wellas shaping legislation and policy (Lockett, 2020). Familyaffirmation, for example, provides a protective factor againstdepression, drug misuse, and suicide among LGBTQ adolescentsand young adults. It increases self-esteem, support networks,general wellness, and is a buffer against depression, drug misuse,and suicide (Reyes et al., 2020; Lampis et al., 2021). Thus,household initiatives that inspire and support parents, careproviders, and other close relatives have been identified as abeneficial paradigm for preventive strategies. This highlightsthe strengths and positive impact of constructive parent-childdynamics. Additionally, a recent comprehensive study (FloresA. R. et al., 2020; Flores D. D. et al., 2020) found that elevateddegrees of community protection were correlated with a healthyego while a shortage of community protection was linked withincreased levels of stress, anxiety, guilt, alcohol and substanceconsumption, practices of unsafe sex, and lower levels of self-esteem. McDonald et al. (2021) emphasized the importance ofacceptance by family and caregivers and a feeling of connection toa friend/community in LGBTQ youth’s psychological wellbeing.IMPACT ON PSYCHOLOGICALWELLBEING AMONG LESBIAN, GAY,BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER, ANDQUEER STUDENTSMental health entails a positive relationship with people andthe pursuit of a productive and fulfilling existence. It has beenshown that those who have a high level of mental health tendto be more lighthearted and lead more energetic and pleasantlives (Chan et al., 2021). Owing to their heightened likelihoodof experiencing psychological challenges, LGBTQ adolescents areamong the most disadvantaged populations in the community(Detrie and Lease, 2007; McGlashan and Fitzpatrick, 2017).According to figures on the LGBTQ community, New Zealandhas an estimated 8% of LGB adolescents, the United States hasan estimated 7–8% of LGB adolescents (Wilson et al., 2014).According to Aranmolate et al. (2017), LGBTQ adolescents’psychological health difficulties are associated with a lack offamilial recognition and experiences of harassment. They aremore likely than their heterosexual counterparts to encounterviolent conditions at home and in the larger community, andare exposed to overt and implicit discrimination, violence,vulnerability, and injustice, all of which have a negative effecton psychological wellbeing (Bertrand et al., 2005; Matebeni et al.,2018; Simons and Russell, 2021).A recent study (Lucassen et al., 2017) found that LGBTQadolescents were three times more likely than their heterosexualcounterparts to exhibit depressive conditions and twice as likelyto harm themselves. In the study, 20% of participants attemptedsuicide, and over half considered it. LGBTQ adolescents weremore likely than their non-LGBTQ counterparts to seek therapyin the previous 12 months, at 41.0%. Additionally, the Youth2000 Survey (Archer et al., 2021) indicates that LGBTQ youthface a higher risk of alcohol or substance usage. In Scotlandover the given time, 40% of LGBT adolescents registered ashaving a psychological disorder, compared to 25% of non-sexualand gender marginalized adolescents and bullying was describedas a significant source of anxiety among LGBT participants(Bradbury, 2020; Pachankis et al., 2020).LGBTQ adolescents, in general, have distinct risk factors, andwhen such specific threats are associated with common stressfulevents, this minority group tend to experience increased self-harm, suicidal tendencies, and emotional instability (Eisenberget al., 2020; Hatchel et al., 2021). These risk factors persistthroughout adulthood, with Sexual/Gender Minority (SGM)person 400% more likely to commit suicide and both malesand females 150% more likely to experience anxiety, depression,and drug abuse (King et al., 2008; Lothwell et al., 2020).In a 2011 article (Chakraborty et al., 2011), it was foundthat gay/lesbian individuals experience elevated degrees ofpsychological discomfort in comparison to straight people.According to previous studies engaging with minoritystress theory (Cyrus, 2017; Fulginiti et al., 2020; Table 1),the rising likelihood of psychological health problems amongLGBTQ adolescents is a result of increased social stress,which includes stigma, discrimination, bias, and victimization.Adolescence is a crucial period in cognitive growth, withelevated impact of pressure on psychological wellbeing andan increased susceptibility to substance use (Tavarez, 2020;Fulginiti et al., 2021). At this critical juncture, experiencingdiscrimination at the hands of academic, clinical, or religiousestablishments, or internalizing victimization as a consequence ofdiscrimination, transphobia, or biphobia, will create substantialmental difficulties for LGBTQ adolescents (Budge et al.,2020; Formby and Donovan, 2020). Marginalization, loneliness,alienation, bullying, and a lack of supportive grown-ups andspaces all contribute to social tension among LGBTQ adolescents(Grossman et al., 2009; Hafeez et al., 2017).Stigma establishes individual obstacles for vulnerableadolescents, stopping them from seeking resources (Cortes,2017). According to Hackman et al. (2020), humiliation, guilt,and apprehension of judgment are all factors explaining whyLGBTQ adolescents stop accessing psychological health care.LGBTQ adolescents who are homeless, remote, or drug addictsexperience greater obstacles to obtaining assistance (Lucassenet al., 2011, Table 1). If parental or specialist assistance isunavailable, LGBTQ adolescents may seek assistance frompeers and resources on online platforms (LaSala, 2015; PullenSansfaçon et al., 2020; Town et al., 2021).Recognition by family members has also been describedas a significant factor influencing the psychological wellbeingof LGBTQ adolescents (Afdal and Ilyas, 2020; Buriæ et al.,2020). According to Strauss et al. (2020), familial engagementis represented by openness and sensitivity to the demands of achild. As LGBTQ adolescents feel welcomed and respected, theyare more likely to reveal their non-normative identities to familymembers (Hagai et al., 2020; Endo, 2021). Nevertheless, a hugepercentage of LGBTQ adolescents are homeless, indicating thatfamily exclusion is a major risk factor for poor psychologicalwellbeing (Travers et al., 2020; MacMullin et al., 2021). Durso andGates (2012) released the findings of a nationwide internet studyin the United States and discovered that nearly 68% of their LGBThomeless clients had encountered family abandonment and over54% had encountered domestic violence.Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 726343104fpsyg-13-726343 April 29, 2022 Time: 9:45 # 5Chan et al. Psychological Wellbeing Among LGBTQ CommunitiesAdolescence is a transitional stage during which adolescentsdiscover their identity, and for LGBTQ adolescents, it is alsothe period during which they gain an awareness of their owngender identity and sexual preference (Prock and Kennedy,2020). Research has shown shifting relationships throughoutadolescence and young adulthood, with a corresponding changein commitment to friends and social classes apart from the family,as well as to entities such as education, colleges, religious orpolitical communities (Huang, 2020; Jordan, 2020). Recognitionby support communities is a powerful preventive mechanism forLGBTQ children and adolescents (Call et al., 2021). A LGBTQ-friendly climate has a profound impact on their psychologicaldevelopment and well-being. Perceptions of social integrationwith grown-ups help LGBTQ adolescents overcome challenges,especially during the precarious developmental phase when theyare developing their sense of self (Proulx et al., 2019).THE SUPPORTIVE STRATEGIES FORINCLUSIVE SCHOOLSThe interaction between a person and his or her environmentaffects personal growth and development according to thesocial ecological model. The risk of suicidal behaviors amongLGBTQ adolescents is influenced by a number of contextualfactors including schools. Institute of Medicine asked forfurther research in 2011, focusing specifically on the impactof protective school policies and students’ perceptions of theirschool environments on their health and well-being (Anchetaet al., 2021). Much research pointed out that schools are well-positioned to address health disparities by creating safe andsupportive school climates for LGBTQ youth (Gower et al.,2018; Woodford et al., 2018; Table 2). Evidence shows thata safe and supportive climate is related to lower odds ofstudent bullying involvement, some types of risky alcoholuse and drug use, and victimization. A safe climate eventmay reduce LGBTQ adolescents’ risk of suicidal thoughts(Konishi et al., 2013; Kosciw et al., 2013; Hatzenbuehleret al., 2014; Gower et al., 2018). Having a supportive schoolenvironment and a sense of belonging to school were associatedwith lower levels of minority stress and better academicresults, health, and wellbeing among LGBTQ students (Dennyet al., 2016; Perales and Campbell, 2020). Research hassuggested multiple strategies for school-based support, includingpolicies, supporting LGBTQ students organizations, educatorintervention and LGBTQ related curriculum (Konishi et al., 2013;Kosciw et al., 2013).More inclusive policies could contribute to the school climateat the macro level. These policies include antidiscriminationpolicies (Woodford et al., 2018) and anti-homophobic bullyingpolicies (Konishi et al., 2013). Compared with students atschools with generic policies or no/unidentified policies, LGBTQstudents in districts with sexual orientation, gender identity,and/or gender expression (SOGIE) protections in their policiesreported greater school safety, less victimization based ontheir sexual orientation and gender expression, and less socialaggression (Kull et al., 2016). Moreover, a greater number ofSOGIE-focused policies was associated with lower truancy for allstudents (Day et al., 2019).Furthermore, gay–straight alliance (GSAs) has been one ofthe major sources of support in high schools in the UnitedStates and Canada. GSAs are student-led, school-based clubs thataim to provide a safe environment in the school context forLGBTQ students, as well as their straight allies (Toomey et al.,2011. In recent decades, the number of GSAs in schools hasincreased dramatically, with over 4,000 GSAs registered in theUnited States (Toomey et al., 2011). Research has suggested thata high school with a GSA can decrease LGBTQ students-risksfor using illicit drugs and prescription drug misuse and reducetheir burden of minority stressors (Heck et al., 2014). GSAs fosterinclusive school environments not only for LGBT + studentsbut for all students, thereby contributing to lower levels ofhomonegative victimization, fear for safety, homophobic remarksand multiple forms of bias-based bullying (based on body weight,gender, religion, disability, gender typicality, sexuality) (Marx andKettrey, 2016; Lessard et al., 2020).Educator intervention and LGBTQ related curriculum alsoconstitute prevention strategies of inclusive schools. Teachersand school staff—in particular, the medical staff—could beprovided with LGBTQ sensitive training and LGBTQ medicalcurricula, which are important for supportive climate buildingand LGBTQ students’ wellbeing (Gower et al., 2018; Tollemacheet al., 2021). By strengthening teachers’ analytical awarenessof alienation experienced by children and adolescents, teachersmay flourish in school, promoting equal opportunity principlesand teaching students about love and consideration, justiceand freedom (Glazzard and Stones, 2020). Willging et al.(2016) demonstrated that RLAS (Implementing School NursingStrategies to Reduce LGBTQ Adolescent Suicide) is applicableto novel nurse-led intervention to address LGBTQ youthsuicide and health-related concerns of other students. All thesestrategies have shown the importance of structural initiativeson campus in protecting LGBTQ students from discrimination(Woodford et al., 2018).DISCUSSIONAround the world, the importance of an inclusive school climateto LGBTQ student has been suggested and advocated forreducing the risk of violence and discrimination and enhancingtheir psychological wellbeing. However, most quantitative studieswere concentrated in the Northern America, particularly theUnited States. There remains a lack of research about LGBTQstudents’ wellbeing in developing countries. Moreover, muchresearch used the data from health or psychological surveysto state that policies, GSAs club, educator intervention, andLGBTQ related curriculum could improve the school climate;nevertheless, less experimental research could provide evidenceand specific methods to guide schools. Further, due to thedisparities among LGBTQ students, a ‘one size fits all’ approachto school policy might not fit all LGBTQ students. Day et al.(2019) have demonstrated that SOGIE-focused policy maysupport LGBTQ youth more than transgender youth.Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 726343105fpsyg-13-726343April29,2022Time:9:45#6Chanetal.PsychologicalWellbeingAmongLGBTQCommunitiesTABLE 2 | The supportive strategies/services and implication with inclusion studies in review.Author/Study Country Supportive strategies/Service Sample/Participants Study Findings ImplicationGower et al.(2018)United States Student-focused (e.g., GSA), staff-focused(e.g., professional development), and acombination (e.g., point person for LGBTstudent issues).

Psychological Wellbeing Among LGBTQ CommunitiesToomey et al. (2011) have pointed out that studentsperceived their schools as safer for gender nonconformingmale peers when schools included LGBTQ issues in thecurriculum and had GSAs. Given the growing significance ofLGBTQ people as active, respected, and noticeable membersof society (Chan, 2021b), it is critical to promote LGBTQacceptance within and beyond campus (Stones and Glazzard,2020). LGBTQ students are more likely to report negativeschool performance when confronted with significant obstaclessuch as bullying, assault, and a lack of role models. Schoolsshould uphold diversity, decency, compassion, and consideration(Chan, 2021c). Additionally, deans of medical schools havesuggested to increase teaching materials related to LGBTQissues in order to improve medical services in schools(Van Bergen et al., 2013).This article has collected and analyzed the existing literatureto indicate violence and prejudice as fundamental causesof psychological problems among LGBTQ adolescents andidentify supportive strategies for schools to build a LGBTQ-friendly environment. However, it is limited because previousstudies still primarily focus on developed countries andoffer limited insights into possible interventions in differentcontexts. This study has suggested how treatments should befurther developed to guarantee lasting welfare and inclusion ofLGBTQ adolescents.CONCLUSIONAs LGBTQ individuals are becoming a more dedicated, respected,and observable component of humanity (Chan, 2021a), schoolsplay a crucial part in ensuring that all children and adolescentsrealize that prejudice and discrimination are unacceptable. Byteaching young people about all kinds of discrimination andtheir negative impact, critical pedagogy plays a crucial part inadvancing human rights. It inspires optimism for the potentialcreation of a more just and fair society and empowers youngpeople to be ethical new generations (Glazzard and Stones,2021). Mental health problems faced by LGBTQ youth arelargely associated with discrimination, prejudice, and a lack ofsupport from family, schools, and society at large. Increasinglevels of support and acceptance for LGBTQ youth will mostlikely require political and social change in today’s world, suchas legalizing same-sex marriage and liberalizing cultural norms.Future research should continue to attend to LGBTQ students’health and educational needs and identify possible interventionsin order to enhance their wellbeing.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAC and DW carried out the outline of this manuscript.
