Thus, although employers in many countries are no longer permitted to advertise jobs for men only, or to relegate female employees to second-class status based on sex differences, doctors are still required to report the sex of infants at birth; myriad forms still require us to list our sex; public restrooms continue to sort us, or ask us to sort ourselves, according to whether we are male or female; and institutions from insurance companies to schools to hospitals to prisons can and still do take sex into account. In institutional settings that retain the classifications, where going sex-neutral is either not possible or else a disfavored policy, there is a growing movement to replace the word and idea of “sex” with the word and idea of “gender” which is understood here to mean gender identity.1 This effort may be based in the view that sex is not binary so that sorting people this way is bad policy. It may also reflect the sense that using the word and idea of “sex” inappropriately excludes people whose gender identity does not match their biology. The Obama Administration’s decision beginning in late 2015 to read out “sex” and read in “gender identity” in its interpretation and enforcement of United States anti-discrimination laws is illustrative of both perspectives. In making this move, the Administration defined “gender identity” as “an individual’s internal sense of  Copyright © 2018 by Doriane Lambelet Coleman.

I am grateful to endocrinologists Richard Clark and Rich Auchus, cardiologist and exercise scientist Ben Levine, and biochemist and anti-doping expert Larry Bowers for their willingness to consult with me on the scientific aspects of this paper to make sure I got those right. I am also indebted to many wonderful colleagues—Matt Adler, Kate Bartlett, Erin Buzuvis, Curt Bradley, Kathy Bradley, Mary Anne Case, Walter Dellinger, Paul Haagen, Joanna Harper, Larry Helfer, Sarah Holsapple, Kim Krawiec, Nancy Leong, Maggie Lemos, Guangya Liu, Pat Shin, Wick Shreve, and Ara Wilson—who at different points in the process gave me their time and suggestions. I come at this project wearing three hats. I was an elite athlete in the earliest years of Title IX and in the race when Jarmila Kratochvilova broke the world record in the women’s 800 meters in 1983; that record still stands today and is at the center of the controversy over intersex athletes in women’s sport. Later, as a lawyer and member of USA Track & Field’s Athletes Advisory Committee, I was part of the project to establish sport’s first rigorous anti-doping programs. I am now an academic who has focused some on doping and the spirit of sport, but mostly on unrelated issues around women, children, medicine and law, including anti-discrimination law. My approach to sex in sport and to women’s-only spaces more generally comes out of this combined experience.  1.  See, e.g., Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Burwell, 227 F. Supp. 3d 660, 668 n.25 (N.D. Tex. 2016) (reflecting on the variable use of the word “gender”). COLEMAN_CROSS REFERENCED (DO NOT DELETE) 2/26/2018  2:49 PM 64 LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS [Vol. 80:63 gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female, and which may be different from an individual’s sex assigned at birth.”2 Especially among social progressives, it is often assumed that this switch is cost-free or that if there are costs, these are easily outweighed by the benefits. For example, the position of the Obama Administration was that switching out sex for gender identity only contributes to the good done by anti-discrimination law by requiring the inclusion of intersex and trans people without affecting other’s legitimate rights and interests.3 This position is controversial because it rests on an as-yet unresolved legal claim about others’ legitimate rights,4 but it is strongly held by many who believe that once opponents are properly informed—about the facts and the value of equality—they will understand that this read is right.5 This article uses standard anti-discrimination analysis to evaluate this assumption about costs. Specifically, it argues that the issue whether erasing sex causes harm is not automatically resolved by generalizations about equality and inclusion or religion. Rather, it depends on the much more mundane work that is assessing institutional mission and the factual relevance of inherent biological differences to that mission. The analysis focuses on competitive sport’s traditional sex classifications, and particularly on its commitment to setting aside the women’s category for biological females only. It returns in the end to the applicability of this methodological approach to other institutional settings in which the legal and policy question whether to erase sex also arises.    2.

COLEMAN_CROSS REFERENCED (DO NOT DELETE) 2/26/2018  2:49 PM No. 4 2017] SEX IN SPORT 65 Like other societal institutions, competitive sport is being challenged to replace “sex” with “identity” and specifically to allow biological males to compete as women if that is their legal or gender identity.6 This includes male-to-female trans athletes and male athletes with differences or disorders of sex development (DSD) who sometimes prefer to be described as “intersex.”7 This effort has gained important traction of late, including with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) which, in an effort to avoid the negative publicity associated with sex testing,8 has at least for now decided to base eligibility for the women’s category on legal identity rather than biological sex.9 Although no sports organization in the United States has yet gone this far, in 2016 the Obama Administration signaled that, in its enforcement of Title IX, it was going to monitor exclusions from high school and college sports consistent with its   6.

COLEMAN_CROSS REFERENCED (DO NOT DELETE) 2/26/2018  2:49 PM 66 LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS [Vol. 80:63 redefinition of “sex” as “gender identity.”10 The Trump Administration has declined to follow suit,11 but individual states and the private sector remain largely free to choose their own course. Taking into account the biology of sex and sex differentiation, its relevance to competitive sport’s mission, and the merits of the challenge from the identity movement, the article makes the case for retaining sex as the basis for classification into the women’s category. Sport is committed to this approach on the view that to ensure females’ equal opportunity to compete and the institution’s ability to promote female empowerment, it is both necessary and lawful to set aside money, coaching, facilities, and events for them only. This was and remains correct. In this particular institutional space, because introducing male bodies into the women’s category would mean that females were not competitive for the win, replacing “sex” with “gender” would “be a disaster for women’s sport . . . a sad end to what feminists have wanted for so long.”12 The article proceeds as follows: Part II sets out the basic elements of anti-discrimination law with a focus on the analysis that applies to evaluating sex discrimination; and it establishes this analysis as the structure for the remainder of the piece. Thus, Part III on inherent differences summarizes the biology of sex and sex differentiation, emphasizing those aspects of human development and physiology that are most relevant to the discussion of sex in sport. Part IV on institutional mission focuses on the relevance of this biology to competitive sport and its goals. These include showcasing the best athletes, producing related benefits for stakeholders, and using sport as a vehicle for social change. It recognizes that replacing sex with identity in this space could contribute to a different set of also-important goals, including the inclusion and empowerment of intersex and trans people; but because sex determines competitiveness and competition is the business of sport, policymakers must choose between the two sets of goals. Analogizing the women’s category to an affirmative action set aside, it makes the feminist and utilitarian case that preserving the category for females is the highest value choice. Part V on the means-ends nexus tackles the practical problem that is sex testing in general and for sport in particular. The article concludes with some reflections on the applicability of the analysis of sex in sport to other institutional settings in which the question whether to read out sex also arises.   10.

I use the words “male” and “female” also in their biological sense, to signify individuals with associated sex characteristics. The relevant biology is described in detail in Part III. Finally, I use the terms “man” and “woman” to signify individuals who identify as such regardless of their biology. II THE ANALYTIC RUBRIC Governments and institutions often make policy choices that discriminate either intentionally or in effect. Discrimination is not categorically good or bad, legal or illegal. Its status depends first on institutional mission and then on the means selected to achieve it.13 Many discriminatory choices are affirmatively good or else not controversial because they easily satisfy this analytical methodology. The institutional mission is generally well understood and respected, and the means-ends nexus is at least rational and often quite direct. For example, a government’s justice department can discriminate against non-lawyers as it seeks to fill a law job because its valuable institutional mission is undoubtedly to retain and operate through government lawyers.14 And an organ transplant consortium can discriminate on the basis of blood type in the allocation of donor organs because its critical mission is to ensure maximum organ and patient life, and giving a recipient an unmatched organ ensures precisely the opposite.15 Different or competing institutional and societal goals such as equal access to jobs and organs are also   13.

BARTLETT, GENDER AND LAW: THEORY, DOCTRINE, COMMENTARY 2 (5th ed. 2010) (“[C]ourts . . . assess[] state-created sex-based classifications by examining their purposes and requiring a reasonably close fit between those purposes and the classifications in question.”).  14.  For employment discrimination standards in general, see, for example, McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800–01 (1973). Procedural aspects of the McDonnell Douglas decision have been superseded so that at least in the United States, the particulars of employment discrimination litigation have changed since 1973; but the essential point for which I cite the case here, that there is a “broad, overriding interest, shared by employer, employee, and consumer” in “efficient and trustworthy workmanship assured through fair and [in this case racially] neutral employment and personnel decisions” stands. Id. The use of qualifications as a way to discriminate among applicants is consistently viewed both as lawful and as a good idea. Id.; see generally, e.g., Ricci v. DeStafano, 557 U.S. 557 (2009) (affirming legality of “reli[ance] on objective examinations to identify the best qualified candidates”); Price Waterhouse v.

Discrimination on the basis of race and sex is often not based on institutionally relevant grounds but rather on subordination norms, false factual assumptions and stereotypes, or comparatively weak interests.16 Because of this, and because many societies have made an affirmative commitment to the anti-subordination project in particular, policy choices that involve race and sex classifications are singled out as categorically suspect and necessitating careful scrutiny.17 Race is the paradigmatic “suspect classification” and gets the most exacting scrutiny because claims about “inherent differences” in this category are almost always false and have traditionally been used to subordinate racial minorities.18 In contrast, sex is considered a “quasi-suspect classification” and gets what is sometimes termed “intermediate”—not as exacting—scrutiny because, unlike race differences, “[p]hysical differences between men and women . . . are enduring.”19 Although the particular language used to describe the sex discrimination standard varies by country and covenant, in general an entity seeking to uphold sex classifications is required to show “at least that the [challenged] classification serves ‘important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed’ are ‘substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.’”20 United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who as a lawyer and jurist has been a principal architect of American anti-sex discrimination law,21 elaborated on this standard in her majority opinion in United States v.   16.

Again, in Justice Ginsburg’s words, Sex classifications may be used to compensate women ‘for particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered,’ to ‘promot[e] equal employment opportunity,’ [and] to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people. But such classifications may not be used, as they once were, to create or perpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women.24 They cannot “deny to women, simply because they are women, . . . equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities.”25 This standard does not require formal equality or sex-blind classifications.26 Such classifications are rhetorically attractive, often effective, and may make for better policy in some circumstances, but in other circumstances justice and equality are better served by affirmative actions that set aside benefits for women only.27 As with race-blindness, it is sometimes the case that sex-blindness serves merely to reinforce subordination as the status quo. For example, merely eliminating sex classifications in hiring—and “men only” references in job advertisements—does not alter the advantage that men have as a result of underlying assumptions about the differences between men’s and women’s aptitudes for the work and traditional practices associated with both employee hiring and management.28 This standard also presumes that “women” means females and not individuals who, regardless of their biology, identify or are identified as women.29 The   22.  518 U.S. at 533.  23.

COLEMAN_CROSS REFERENCED (DO NOT DELETE) 2/26/2018  2:49 PM 70 LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS [Vol. 80:63 “inherent differences” at issue are biological sex characteristics.30 The question whether identity rather than biology will come to define the category for this and other purposes has been raised but not resolved; and it remains highly controversial even in the United States.31 What this means is that for the moment at least, biological males who identify as women may not automatically benefit from anti-subordination set asides for women. They cannot simply read themselves into the category. Rather, they must challenge and erode the case for the set asides, and in turn, because they are based in evolving anti-subordination norms, those who would defend such measures must continue to update the case in their favor. This rubric already governs the legal analysis of competitive sport’s sex classifications, including in domestic law and at the private Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).32 Because it separately provides the template for a thorough and rigorous evaluation of their policy merits and of the merits of alternative classification schemes, it is used as the structure of the remainder of this article. Thus, Part III describes the inherent biological differences between males and females relevant for competitive sport. Part IV sets out sport’s institutional mission, the link between that mission and inherent differences, and the argument that sport should be permitted to continue to set aside the women’s category exclusively for females even though this choice operates to exclude intersex and trans athletes who identify as women. Part V focuses on the means sport has and should continue to use to protect the category. III INHERENT DIFFERENCES THE BIOLOGY OF SEX AND DIFFERENTIATION Sex classifications are ubiquitous across institutions and societies. Sometimes the use of sex as a basis for classifying people is simply a matter of tradition or efficiency, without regard to whether particular sex characteristics are actually related to the institutional objectives at issue. In other instances, sex classifications are important because the particular inherent differences are clear   30.  518 U.S. at 533.

Understanding the biology of sex and sex differentiation is essential to being able to sort among competing claims about inherent sex differences and the relevance of sex in particular contexts, and to drawing good lines between the sexes when necessary. *     *     * The biology of sex and sex differentiation is well understood. It has a genetic basis including genetic norms and genetic anomalies, and this genetic basis influences human development, which likewise includes norms and anomalies.33 Finally, we know that testosterone (T) is a significant player in this biological story. Most females have a matching XX pair of chromosomes and most males have an unmatched XY pair.34 According to the World Health Organization, this genetic standard is the case in all but “a few births per thousand.”35 The “normal human fetus of either sex has the potential to develop either male or female organs, depending on genetic and hormonal influences.”36 Specifically, “all developing embryos become feminized unless masculinizing influences [androgens] come into play at key times during gestation.”37 Sex differentiation, defined in the first instance as the development of the testes, is triggered by the SRY gene which is present on the Y chromosome.38 Androgens, primarily testosterone, are first produced in the undifferentiated gonadal ridge39 and later mainly “by the testes and in lesser amounts by the   33.

For example, some individuals with high T are not athletes and so are unlikely to outperform trained athletes with lower T. This is evident in mixed and open road races, when some elite females run faster than some non-elite males. Even among athletes, better training and preparation can ensure that individuals with relatively low T can outperform relatively high T individuals who train and prepare differently. But there is no scientific doubt that testosterone is the reason that men as a group perform better than women in sports. Indeed, this is why men and women dope with androgens.54 Finally, although there is some disagreement about whether brain differences are best viewed as primary or secondary sex characteristics,55 it is understood that testosterone “influences the brain via organizational and activational effects.”56  the premise that the ranges should be based on “normal” readings so that T levels may be used for diagnostic and treatment purposes, and propose instead that they ought to reflect all “naturally occurring” readings; and they include in this category readings from individuals who are healthy and who have medical conditions requiring treatment. These arguments have gotten no traction except in circles where the science and its implications for medicine and doping are not well understood. See, e.g., Dutee Chand, CAS 2014/A/3759, at ¶ 497 (rejecting both arguments on the ground that they are “based on hypotheses and sociological explanation and deductions . . . not scientific or clinical data”).  54.  Endocrinologists and anti-doping experts understand this point well. Their clinical experience is that the physiological effects of endogenous and exogenous testosterone match. The best-studied evidence for this point is probably a comparison of the effects of PCOS, in which ovarian tumors naturally produce excess endogenous testosterone, and the effects of exogenous testosterone ingestion by females. See generally, e.g., E. Alexiou et al., Hyperandrogenemia in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Prevalence, Characteristics and Association with Body Mass Index, 29 HORMONE MOLECULAR BIOLOGY & CLINICAL INVESTIGATION 105 (2017); Grace Huang et al., Testosterone Dose-Response Relationships in Hysterectomized Women with and without Oophorectomy: Effects on Sexual Function, Body Composition, Muscle Performance and Physical Function in a Randomized Trial, 21 MENOPAUSE 612 (2014) (comparing effects of exogenous T use with placebo group with endogenous T); S.

Genetic and developmental anomalies can alter individual development in all of these respects.65 These anomalies were historically known as “hermaphroditism,” a word which comes from the Greek “Hermaphroditos” after “the son of Hermes and Aphrodite, who . . . was loved by the nymph Salmacis so ardently that she prayed for complete union with him and as a result they were united bodily, combining male and female characteristics.”66 The term encompassed both so-called “true” and “pseudo” hermaphrodites, that is, in the former instance individuals “in which reproductive organs of both sexes are present”67 and in the latter “having internal reproductive organs of one sex and external sexual characteristics resembling those of the other sex or being ambiguous in nature.”68 Medical experts in the modern era have traditionally used the term “disorders of sex development” or, more recently, “differences of  Jenner’s pre-transition declaration that “he knew he was transgender” because “My brain is much more female than it is male.” Elinor Burkett, What Makes a Woman?, N.Y.

I agree with Burkett that it can be risky to acknowledge sex differences including perhaps especially brain differences, but the fact that it may be risky does not change the underlying biology. And if understanding that is relevant to making good policy, in my view it ought to be on the table.  65.  Although this article examines the case for including intersex and trans athletes in the women’s category in competitive sport, in this summary of the biology of sex, I focus on intersex conditions because these have been the focus of ongoing study for over a century, whereas the biology of gender dysphoria is not yet well understood. See supra note 56 (summarizing the current state of the biological evidence).

Although PCOS is not the result of a developmental difference, it is grouped with CAH in this context because it affects 46,XX females and for its hyperandrogenic effects.  Two other conditions, 5-alpha reductase deficiency (5-ARD) and androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), can cause undervirilization—T levels at the lower end or below the bottom of the male reference range—in 46,XY males. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) “is the most common condition in newborns with DSD, accounting for 60–70% of all cases.”74 CAH is “a group of disorders . . . that affect the adrenal glands” causing them to “produce excess androgens” as a result of a deficiency in the hydroxylase enzyme.75 As a result, 46,XX females with CAH can have T levels above the female reference range—“hyperandrogenism”—which can in turn trigger doping positives under elite sport protocols.76 However, because the condition is also associated with important health effects including, depending on the type, cortisol deficiency, hypertension, and salt wasting, affected individuals are unlikely to be significantly represented in the elite athlete population.77 Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) affects approximately 4% of genetic females. Like CAH, PCOS can cause hyperandrogenism and thus trigger doping positives under competitive sport protocols.78 In this instance, ovarian cysts rather than the adrenal glands are responsible for producing the excess androgens.79 But because PCOS is also associated with important health effects, including low VO2 max, obesity, and metabolic abnormalities, individuals with the condition are again unlikely to be significantly represented in the elite athlete population.80 In contrast with CAH and PCOS, both 5-ARD and AIS involve individuals who are genetically and gonadally male—46,XY with functioning testes—but who have either ambiguous or phenotypically female external genitalia and thus are often identified at birth and raised as girls. Whether their endogenous androgens are bioavailable determines, among other things, whether their secondary sex characteristics are male or female. Regardless, because their T   74.

Occasionally, patients can appear more masculinized; they may lack a separate vaginal opening, and have isolated penile hypospadias or even a penile urethra. The uterus and fallopian tubes are absent because of the normal secretion of the müllerian-inhibiting factor. Testes are intact and are usually found in the inguinal canal or scrotum; however, cryptorchidism is frequently described with testes occasionally located in the abdomen.85    81.  At least one early paper suggested the view that “individuals raised as females” with these conditions were believed to have “no unfair physical advantage and should not be unfairly excluded [from elite sports competitions] or stigmatized.” Louis J. Elsas et al., Gender Verification of Female Athletes, 2 GENETICS MED. 249, 250 (2000). It is unclear from the available record what led to this sense, although one may speculate that it was based on the fact that the DSD experts consulted were not familiar with sport, the field of exercise science, and in particular the causes of the performance gap. It may also have been the case that by “raised as females” they understood that the affected individuals would already have had gonadectomies, since this was mostly the authors’ and the Western experience. See, e.g., id. at 251, Table 1 (reflecting this fact as late as 1996). Finally, it is possible that the authors knew that these conditions confer unusual performance advantages but held the normative position they were not “unfair” from a policy perspective because the affected individuals had been raised as females. In any event, today it is well understood that unless they have had gonadectomies, individuals with 5-ARD and partial AIS have T levels in the male range and these levels confer the anabolic and performance advantages enjoyed by biological males without DSD.

People with this form of the condition have the external sex characteristics of females, but do not have a uterus and therefore do not menstruate and are unable to conceive a child (infertile).

Affected individuals have male internal sex organs (testes) that are undescended, which means they are abnormally located in the pelvis or abdomen.92 In contrast, “mild” and “partial” AIS “result when the body’s tissues are partially sensitive to the effects of androgens.”93 Individuals with the mild or “minimal” form “are phenotypically male; the most common symptom is infertility. Mild gynecomastia or mild impairment of virilization may be present.”94 Individuals with the partial form (PAIS) “can have normal female sex characteristics, both male and female sex characteristics, or normal male sex characteristics.

Consistent with “their non-overlapping ranges in normal testosterone levels”101—12 to 61 ng/dl for females and 295 to 1150 ng/dl for males102—graphing these data results in a distinct bimodal distribution. Almost all data points on that distribution represent individuals who fit neatly into one of two categories: male or female. A relative few—between .1 and 1%—do not fit so neatly and are distributed in between, or, intersex. The incidence of intersex conditions most relevant for sport—5-ARD and PAIS—is much lower, and thus taking only these into account would make the bimodal distribution clearer. On the other hand, adding individuals with gender dysphoria103 to intersex would grow the incidence of sex atypical individuals. Their particular incidence is not yet well understood; for example, about one half of one percent (.6%) of Americans are said to identify as trans, but because of the stigma still associated with the condition, this percentage likely reflects a degree of underreporting.104 Nevertheless, even if it eventually doubles so that the combined incidence of intersex and trans is approximately 1–2%, the bimodal distribution remains distinct. This biology, including the bimodal distribution, is the basis for the ubiquity of sex as a societal taxonomy, including in sport, and also of the widely-held view that sex is binary.

It can change the way a person wants to express their gender and can influence behavior, dress and self-image. Some people may cross-dress, some may want to socially transition, others may want to medically transition with sex-change surgery and/or hormone treatment.

Parts III and IV below elaborate on the relevance of these inherent differences. IV INSTITUTIONAL MISSION Like many other societal institutions, competitive sport has long used sex as a taxonomy, classifying individuals as either male or female. In the beginning females were classified out of sport—that is, they were excluded entirely because of sex. When they were finally included, it was in separate segregated events. Despite the proliferation of open competitions and the advent of some mixed events, sex segregation remains the approach today.105 The early history reflected a combination of antiquated gender norms and a sometimes-erroneous sense of the physical capacities of the female body.106 The modern approach may continue to incorporate traditional norms, especially in international competition which necessarily contemplates the kaleidoscope of cultural and religious perspectives of the Olympic Movement’s member states. But it is mostly rationalized on the basis of sport’s institutional goals which include providing equal opportunity for females in and lifting females up through sport, and on the fact that because of inherent differences, this goal cannot be met without continuing to separate the sexes. Replacing sex with gender identity across all institutions would satisfy a different set of also-important goals, but these are in tension with sport’s institutional mission: in sport, you cannot simply make this switch or get rid of classifications altogether and arrive at the same ends. Institutional acts of sex segregation and discrimination should always be viewed with suspicion and subject to rigorous challenge, but where these are necessary to the attainment of valuable institutional goals, as the women’s category is in sport, they are lawful and should be affirmed.    105.  Open competitions are those in which males and females compete at the same time—for example, in a road race—but results are classified according to sex. Mixed competitions are those in which males and females compete directly; for example, in a tennis mixed doubles match in which each doubles team has one male and one female.  106.  See Richard C.

The Goals of Competitive Sport Competitive sport’s institutional goals are to showcase the best athletes, to produce related benefits for stakeholders, and to use sport as a means to spread certain values throughout society. In all three respects, sport seeks specifically to reverse societies’ traditional subordination of women by providing females with opportunities for equal treatment and empowerment. It has chosen to fulfill this mission by classifying athletes according to their sex and setting aside the women’s category for females only. 1. Showcasing the Best Athletes American jurist, academic, and public intellectual Richard Posner captured competitive sport’s original goal perfectly when he wrote that the institution was “designed to highlight, isolate, and display one or more” of the “hierarchies of height, strength . . . agility, physical coordination, beauty, [and] brilliance . . . and to invite our admiration for the athletes who occupy the highest rungs.”107 This original design focused on promoting individual competitors and on facilitating society’s admiration for the best among them. In particular, the design focused both on competitors’ athletic performance and on the aesthetics of the perfected human body. Thus, athletes in Ancient Greece competed for laurels in footraces, field events, and contact sports, and “were naked when they [did], to display their physical prowess and also to pay homage to Zeus by showing him how they had trained their bodies to their physical peak.”108 The emphasis on the perfection of the body related to its capacities for performance, but it was more than that: “[E]xternal beauty represented each competitor’s internal beauty and demonstrated their desire for a balance between body and mind.”109 Although featuring the aesthetics of the perfected human form is no longer a consistent or explicit goal for sports’ governing bodies, as Posner’s encapsulation suggests, for athletes and those who would market and admire them, “athletic prowess” and “external beauty” often continue to go in tandem.110 Indeed, as sculpture and painting across the centuries and the modern focus on athletes’ bodies demonstrates, striving toward and admiring physical perfection—however that is defined in any given period and place—seems either to be a natural and adaptive human trait or at least a more-or-less constant norm. Posner himself argues that “human delight” in “hierarchies” is “innate” and that “[t]he origins of this innate delight are, plausibly, evolutionary.”111 He also argues that this   107.  Richard A.

Any other option that has males and females competing together works mainly to highlight, isolate, and display male bodies and hierarchies. As sports scientist Ross Tucker and other relevant experts have emphasized, “[w]ithout a women’s category, elite sport would be exclusively male.”116 As Part III details, testes and bioavailable testosterone in the male range build and sustain the male body, first in utero and then in puberty.

Nancy Leong and others disagree that sex classifications are the only solution to the performance gap. For example, Leong argues that sports and events could be re-designed so that women’s sports de-emphasize physical attributes like power, strength, and speed—traditionally male sex traits. Nancy Leong, Against Women’s Sports, WASH. U. L. REV. (forthcoming 2018), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2923503 [https://perma.cc/SY24-XRKZ] (“[S]ex segregation uncritically prioritizes athletic activities involving strengths typically associated with male bodies, without forcing us to ask why we view these strengths as the most important in the first place.”). It is absolutely right that modern sports and events were designed with the male body in mind and that elite female athletes mostly compete in those same sports and events. See Posner supra note 107, at 1729 (“[S]ports . . . isolate and exhibit innate hierarchies, most of which are closely related to the hierarchies that fascinated primitive man—hierarchies of the traits that promote success in hunting and fighting.”). It is also possible that the best females could be competitive for the win if, for example, the focus in swimming competitions was not on the pool but on longer, open water events where female-friendly physical attributes like endurance and buoyancy are privileged over strength and speed. See FINA Open Water Swimming Grand Prix 2017, FED’N INT’L DE NATATION (Sept. 3, 2017), http://www.fina.org/ competition-detailed-results/136224/24441 [https://perma.cc/JX7A-RSDP] (providing results of men’s and women’s 16 kilometer races). Because of this sexist history and the possibilities, as well as the goods that could flow from integrated events where females could compete for the win, elite sport should be creative and continually seek to develop and promote such events. At the same time, it is the case today and likely for the foreseeable future that society will continue to invest most heavily in traditional sports and events where the performance gap is largely immutable. It is also possible that females could not be competitive for the win even in redesigned events unless these completely eliminate strength, speed, and power as relevant attributes. Because of this, a continued focus on assuring equal opportunity for females in traditional arenas is essential.

They include skeletal structure, muscle composition, heart and lung capacity including VO2 max, red blood cell count, body fat, and the absolute ability to process carbohydrates.117 Although some social scientists and athletes argue otherwise,118 these sex characteristics are the biological basis for the average 10–12% performance gap between elite male and elite female athletes.119 Stereotype and discrimination certainly affect some female athletes’ results, but not the baseline differential.120 For example, no matter how great the great Katie Ledecky gets—and she is said to be “better at swimming than anyone is at anything”121—she will never beat Michael Phelps or his endurance counterparts in the pool.122 Ledecky’s   117.

Katrina Karkazis, in particular, makes this argument and provides as evidence the fact that some event times at the 2009 World Championships in athletics overlapped. See Katrina Karkazis et al., Out of Bounds: A Critique of the New Policies on Hyperandrogenism in Elite Female Athletes, 12 AM. J. BIOETHICS 3, 7–8 (2012). This reflects a lack of relevant knowledge. Men’s middle and long distance events in championship races tend to be highly tactical and as such finish times are often very slow. What matters here is the medal, not the time. This is in contrast with events on the professional circuit. For instance, in Diamond League races, where personal bests and world records are rewarded in addition to the win. The men’s 1500 Meters Final at the Rio Games exemplifies this tendency. See, e.g., Sarah Lorge Butler, Men’s 1500: Matthew Centrowitz Gets First U.S. Gold Since 1908, RUNNER’S WORLD (Aug. 20, 2016), http://www.runnersworld.com/print/olympics/mens-1500-matthew-centrowitz-gets-first-us-gold-since-1908 [https://perma.cc/2K7V-C4J7] (noting that split times until the final 400 meters were slow even in comparison to non-elite women’s times). Because females don’t have the same explosive power and speed as men, they don’t have the luxury of running so tactically, and so championship times in the women’s category tend to be fast. No female could have been competitive over the final lap of the 2016 Olympic Men’s 1500 Meters Final, which Centrowitz completed in 50.62 seconds, a competitive women’s 400 meters time.

In this context, what is level or even is that everyone is the same sex: they either have testes and bioavailable testosterone outside of the female range or they don’t. Elite sport set out purposefully to compare like to like in that respect, and then to establish and showcase the hierarchies within the category.127 That is when Katie Ledecky shines. That is when she is a lap ahead rather than a lap behind the nearest competition.128 These same sex characteristics also explain why many non-elite males are competitive with and often better than elite females. For example, “[m]ost of the women’s world records [in athletics], even doped, lie outside the top 5000 times run by men.

Sex, specifically testes and their effects, matter in ways that other biological differences among athletes do not.134 For example, swimmer and multiple Gold Medalist Missy Franklin is six feet two inches tall135 with a wingspan of six feet four inches.136 Her world record in the 200 meters backstroke, set at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, is 2:04.06.

There is a 10–12% difference between [elite] male and [elite] female athletic performance.142 We need to categorize with criteria that are relevant to performance.”143 Competitive sport’s goal of isolating and displaying female bodies and hierarchies, and inviting admiration for the athletes who occupy their highest rungs, has been challenged by some opponents of the sex categories who suggest that it is a pretext for policing femininity.144 This is a legitimate critique if by   140.

And they ought to fail.  The human tendency to search for perfection in sport is the same tendency that leads sculptors and musicians, scientists and writers, all of us, to search for perfection in our respective spheres. It is not an egalitarian trait by any means, but it has yielded significant value for societies in which it is nurtured.149 Thus, sport incentivizes the perfection of the athletic female body in its performance and aesthetic aspects, and when this is done right, including without erasing differences in form and function or “sexualizing female existence,” the institution celebrates and allows societies to “celebrate[] female strength, skill and excellence.”150 2.

Although competitive sport is clearly not the only way to develop professional skills, sport “teaches fundamentals for success” which is why “executives like to hire athletes.”168 Consistent with these preferences, the data suggest that, whatever their place in the hierarchy of talents and abilities, former athletes “are more likely than [others] to be thriving in purpose, social community and physical well-being.”169 Again in the beginning, sport was designed only to benefit males and their associates, but today it is designed also to benefit females and theirs. Specifically, beginning in the early 1900s, females were included in competitive sport out of recognition that exclusive traditions and stereotypes were no longer societally acceptable and to expand the reach of the institution also to this segment of the population.170 More recently, competitive sport has committed to the women’s category both to provide females with an equal opportunity at the direct and indirect goods of sport and to feature successful female athletes and competitions as a way to combat traditions and stereotypes that subordinate women more generally. Title IX in the United States is illustrative of the latter two rationales.171 It is because of these dedicated efforts that there are female champions like Serena Williams and Katie Ledecky, that we know who they are, that they provide role models for aspiring champions, and that girls and women are able to have the experiences and develop the professional skills that make them competitive with men for the longer term positive opportunities and outcomes outside of athletics. And again, if sport did not act affirmatively to carve out an exclusive women’s category defined by sex, females and their associates would be excluded from the most important of these benefits.172 As the IOC’s recent experience and the  society, strong communities, mental and physical health and the economic benefits that flow from a healthy population, the development of successful traits including “confidence and self-esteem,” and reduced crime rates, as among the benefits that flow from strong participation rates).  167.

The principal support for this proposition lies in “before and after” stories like that of Title IX. See, e.g., Lopiano, supra note 165, at 163–73. For example, it is widely recognized that Title IX, which has been interpreted to require parity of opportunity between the sexes in education-based sport, resulted in “major changes in the psychologic and sociologic environments of women and girls in society.” Id. at 171–72.  Specifically, women and girls who participate in sport today have “greater confidence, self-esteem, and pride in their physical and social selves.” Id. at 165. Title IX has also afforded girls and women access to the setting “where boys have traditionally learned about teamwork, goal-setting, the pursuit of excellence in performance, and other achievement-oriented behaviors and other critical skills necessary for success in the workplace.” Id. (“I believe that it is no accident that 80% of the female executives in Fortune 500 companies identified themselves as having been ‘tomboys.’”).  173.  See infra notes 232–236 and accompanying text (discussing the Women’s 800 Meters Final at the 2016 Rio Games). Some U.S. states have implemented Title IX in a way that requires not only the creation of sports opportunities for females but also equal opportunity for girls and boys. One effect of this sex blind interpretation of the statute has been to cause boys to join girls’ teams, which provide them with an opportunity they would otherwise be missing, either entirely or in the relevant period, to benefit from sports-specific training and competitive opportunities. To my knowledge none of the boys identified as intersex or trans; however, like all mixed or open events, this experience provides direct evidence of the effects of including male bodies in female sport.

In particular, sport’s commercialization, the high price nations and municipalities must pay to secure important events and teams, and the opportunity costs associated with that price are seen as anathema to many who would prefer different allocations. Four prominent perennial challenges are the generally losing proposition of hosting the Olympic Games,179 the high cost of the stadiums necessary to keep professional teams,180 the astronomical salaries paid to some top athletes,181 and the outsized role of big time sports in some college settings.182 Some critics have also challenged the exclusiveness of competitive sport; the fact that there are winners and losers for participation, celebration, and success, especially in youth settings contradicts the “everyone can play” model they prefer.183 These challenges are unlikely to win in the broadest marketplace of ideas: at least some cities will continue to find value in hosting the Games and building stadiums, teams will certainly continue to find value in funding winning athletes and ventures, and at least collectively, we will continue to enjoy  of the six places in the state high school final, finishing second and sixth respectively, their best performances were well outside of the range necessary to swim in college.

Using Sport for Social Change Finally, sport is a global enterprise which intends to extend its goods and influence as broadly as possible.186 The most prominent manifestation of this goal today is commercial; for example, the NBA exporting its product—the sport and the business of basketball—to China,187 and Nike exporting its product—physical fitness and related clothing and equipment—to India.188 But it was originally and is still also political and cultural. Nelson Mandela, who famously banked on rugby as a force for political change in his home country of South Africa,189 understood that “[s]port has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand.”190 This idea is the cornerstone of the Laureus   184.  Indeed, as to competition, the trend is to increase opportunities rather than to shift focus from competitive to non-competitive opportunities; this is rationalized on the grounds that are described above, that participation in competitive sport provides important valuable social benefits that should be available to everyone.

The unsettling of social norms based specifically in facts and stereotypes about female bodies—their traditional procreative function and relative strength and power—requires attention to these bodies and all that they can actually do. Anti-discrimination messaging and humanitarian work that erases these differences or features and focuses on male bodies and their circumstances cannot do this work. It also makes practical sense to work within the taxonomy of the target populations. The fact that this taxonomy overlaps almost perfectly with sport’s goal both enhances the likelihood of progress and ensures that the approach is carefully tailored. Sport is properly subject to the criticism that its rights mission is sometimes just rhetoric, and that its commercial aims dwarf, and are often in tension with, this mission. More specifically, no one is or should be under the illusion that sport can singlehandedly change the fate of women around the world. Nevertheless, experience shows that sport does have the power to contribute to the unsettling of subordinating stereotypes and norms when it specifically promotes and sets aside separate opportunities for females. Title IX has undoubtedly served this function in the United States and the draw of prize money and medals has served a similar function in countries like Kenya and Ethiopia.201 Indeed, even the most traditional societies can be seen turning to sport as political tool to signal and bolster the creation of new rights for girls and women. The best example of this phenomenon in the current period may be Saudi Arabia, where “[p]hysical education is not on the curriculum for girls in . . . schools” and their “participat[ion] in sports is an act of defiance” against conservative doctrine.202 Nevertheless, in a “major shift” away from this tradition, the country sent four female athletes to the 2016 Olympics in Rio for the first time, as part of a package   199.

The Challenge from the Gender Identity Movement Like the feminist movement before it, the gender identity movement seeks to persuade institutional decision makers to develop policies designed to recognize, normalize, include, and empower intersex and trans people who throughout history have been erased or severely marginalized and often subject to violence.204 Mostly this movement has focused on the trans community, which is both larger and particularly “associated with high levels of stigmatization, discrimination and victimization, contributing to negative self-image and increased rates of other mental disorders.”205 For example, in the United States, “[t]ransgender individuals are at a higher risk of victimization and hate crimes than the general public” and “[a]dolescents and adults with gender dysphoria are at increased risk for suicide.”206 In less tolerant parts of the world, trans people are at even greater risk of violence, social isolation, and reduced life span.207 As part of this policy reform effort, the movement of individuals aligned with it seek to have institutions replace sex-based classifications with classifications based on identity.208 Although this switch is often couched differently, for example for recognition of intersex and trans people based on their identity,209   203.

The simple but powerful point is that sex-based classifications by definition exclude all trans and some intersex people because their biology does not match their identity.210 Erasing biology and focusing singularly on identity serves to highlight similarities rather than differences and to ensure inclusion on the grounds of similarity. Thus, everyone who identifies as a woman is a woman—we are all alike in this way—even if our biology is different otherwise.211 This identity may have been assigned at birth—in the case of intersex people—or assumed by the individual herself later in life—in the case of trans people—but either way, the argument appears to be that because identity is essential to personhood and inclusive in ways that biology is not, it ought not only to be respected but privileged. The related argument that sex is on a spectrum serves as practical support for this view; that is, it is argued that it also makes sense to use identity instead of sex since sex can be “messy.”212 Consistent with this goal, individuals aligned with the identity movement have challenged sex classifications in a number of institutional contexts. For example, they have challenged the necessity of governments’ administrative interests in easily identifying people by their physical characteristics including their biological sex, resulting in the reformation in some jurisdictions of the rules that govern the amendment of birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and other vital identity documents.213 They have challenged others’ privacy interests in sharing  Feldman, Who Are Women’s Colleges For?, N.Y.

The claims have varied depending on the interests of the particular intersex and trans athletes at issue, but in general they have been for inclusion into the women’s category of athletes with male bodies who identify as women.

Although these approaches do not eliminate all of the performance advantages associated with having a male body—much of this advantage is structural and set in utero and in puberty—either or both would cause a reduction in the athlete’s testosterone levels from within to below the male range.220 Because of this, and because they are medical standard of care for transitioning outside of sport,221 it was seen by sports policymakers as an acceptable compromise.222 More recently, however, the claim from those with male bodies who identify as women has been for the right to compete in the women’s category without condition, that is, without having to alter their biology. For example, in advance of and around the time of the 2016 Rio Games, athletes with 5-ARD and PAIS who identified as women—including, most prominently, South African runner Caster Semenya—were re-described as “natural women” who were “gifted” genetically with “hyperandrogenism.”223 They are “natural” because their bodies have not been altered. They are “women” because this is how they identify. And they are genetically “gifted” with “hyperandrogenism” because they have the SRY gene, testes, bioavailable testosterone in the male range, and the male secondary sex characteristics that result from those primary characteristics. This last version of the claim for inclusion is supported by three related arguments, all of which are designed to convince the public and policymakers that the goals of the feminist and identity movements are aligned or at least not significantly inconsistent. The first is rhetorical—that switching out sex for identity in this space would do no cognizable harm. Specifically, some advocates and academics suggest that including intersex and trans women in the women’s category would not change  longer produce testosterone in the male range. But up to the point of their surgeries, which generally occur after puberty, their bodies developed as male with all of the structural advantages that entails. Athletes with 5-ARD and PAIS may have had gonadectomies as children pre-puberty, in which case their bodies did not develop as male in that period; but if the surgeries occurred after puberty, they also developed as male. Athletes with these conditions may not have a fully formed penis and their testes may sometimes be undescended, but these differences from the male norm, while deeply challenging for cultural reasons and reproduction, are not relevant to performance.  220.

According to this argument, because all who identify as women are “natural women” we would all be in this together and thus there would or should be no in-group fight about the boundaries of the category.224 Moreover, the fact that females would lose to women would be logically irrelevant and so not a cognizable harm, since “women” not “females” is the category, and since a woman would always win the women’s category. That woman might be male in all relevant biological respects, but unless she were feigning her identity, on the same logic, there would be no cognizable harm.225 Finally, the fact that the women’s category would include individuals who are male and thus look like men should cause no cognizable harm because characterizing women according to a particular standard of physical femininity would be impermissibly exclusionary.226 The entire point of the project to replace biological sex with identity is to make the physical irrelevant. The second is that even if the physical is relevant, the performance gap between elite females and intersex and trans women is likely to be smaller than average, and thus, that including the latter in the women’s category should be insignificantly disruptive of the natural hierarchy. This is the argument that Dutee Chand has made in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) which has also been adopted by Caster Semenya’s advocates.227 It is buttressed by, among others, the argument that this likely smaller performance gap proves that testosterone is not sui generis as a biological trait, that it is no more special than other innate and cultural advantages that can also affect an individual athlete’s potential to be competitive for the win.228 The third predicts that because switching out sex for identity only opens up the women’s category to intersex or trans males who either already do or determine openly to live as women, and because these populations will always be small relative to the population of biological females who continue to identify as women, the inclusion of intersex and trans people in the women’s category could be predicted to have a less-than-important effect on elite competition.229 This   224.

This argument is based on my conversations with individuals associated with the development COLEMAN_CROSS REFERENCED (DO NOT DELETE) 2/26/2018  2:49 PM No. 4 2017] SEX IN SPORT 107 argument suggests that policymakers in sport can have it all, that there are so few intersex and trans women relative to the population of females that including the former in otherwise restricted spaces contributes to their normalization and empowerment without significantly disturbing the different project that is establishing the female hierarchy of talents and abilities and using it to promote female empowerment. All three arguments are flawed. Including biological males who identify as women in the women’s category would cause important harm to competitive sport and its stakeholders, including female athletes and those groups and projects that depend on their win share. These arguments are analyzed here in reverse order. It is true that the incidence of people with intersex conditions relevant to sport is extremely low.230 The number who would be involved in sport can be predicted to be even lower. And although the incidence of trans women is higher, it is reasonable to assume that it will still be small relative to the number of biological females.231 Nevertheless, there are good reasons not to underestimate their potential effects on the women’s category. If males with DSD and male-to-female trans athletes could compete as women without condition and controversy, including without harm to competitive sports’ various brands, they would be identified by scouts and featured more systematically by teams; and because of the performance gap, their win share would increase disproportionately.232 There is some indication that this is already happening. For example, there is a recognized “recruitment bias” for XY women in athletics (track and field),233 and a recent study found specifically that “the incidence of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency in elite female athletes that screen positive for hyperandrogenemia may be more than 200 times that of the general population.”234 Thus, the reported 3:8 incidence of males with very rare DSDs in the women’s 800 meters final at the Rio Olympics was not a coincidence, nor was the fact that these athletes took all three spots on the podium.235  of the related regulations and with people outside of sport who have become interested in the debate within sport. In these conversations, especially among those who are not well-versed in the biology, it is something of a refrain that the incidence of intersex and trans people who identify as women is so small relative to the population of normative women that their inclusion will do no harm.  230.

It is also true that the performance gap between elite females and intersex and trans athletes who identify as women will likely not be as large as the average 10–12% performance gap between elite females and elite males. It could be in individual instances if, for example, an elite male athlete like Bruce Jenner decided to come out as Caitlyn in the midst of her athletic career. But the gap between elite females and intersex and trans athletes who identify as women would likely take account of a lot of non-elite athletes who could be successful in the women’s but not the men’s category; and as such, it likely would be smaller. Notably, as to trans women and individuals with 5-ARD and as Figure 1 describes, this would not be because they had lower T levels than elite males, as their levels are generally in the normal male range. Rather, it would be because, like the hundreds of men who surpass the women’s marathon world record every year but do not make it to the elite level,237 they can beat the best females but are not as good as the best males. This begs the question whether it matters how large the performance gap is, if—however large or small—it always determines females’ capacity for the win and their overall win share. Paula Radcliffe, who holds the marathon world record in the women’s category, beat and was beaten by a lot of males on the day she set that record.238 The gap between her performance and the average of all of   236.

But this does not change the fact that if they were all classified together, Radcliffe would have lost the race, would not have set any kind of record, and because of this, we would not know who she was. In these circumstances, the answer to the question whether the size of the performance gap matters has to be no. If, as a categorical matter, non-doped females cannot compete for the win because they don’t have the testes and bioavailable testosterone associated with this sex characteristic, it is irrelevant that the degree of difference is 2% or 12% or somewhere in between. Insurmountability ought to be the dividing line or else it means nothing to set aside women’s sport for biological females. Finally, the argument that switching out sex for identity does no cognizable harm erases exactly the harm that matters for many, if not most, females. That is, it threatens the movement to ensure equality for women who have been subjugated across millennia and cultures precisely because they are physically different from men.239 The goals of this movement are not primarily about identity; rather, they are about equal opportunity despite these physical differences which are, in the realm and dialect of sport, relative handicaps.240 In addition to the performance gap, which is immutable, these include at least the physical conditions for menses, pregnancy, and breastfeeding, if not these processes themselves.241 For example, tennis champion Novak Djokovic may have been impolitic when he expressed his respect for what elite female athletes accomplish despite their menstrual cycles,242 but he was not wrong to acknowledge—as women do  http://www.marathonguide.com/results/browse.cfm?RL=1&MIDD=16030413&Gen=M&Begin=1&End=100&Max=23893 [https://perma.cc/RM7C-YKEF] (last visited Oct. 10, 2017).  239.

Because of this, affirmative actions like Title IX, the Olympic Movement’s sex classifications, and the intentional promotion of femininity as embodying both mental and physical strength are necessary to ensure that females also benefit from the highly prized goods of competitive sport.245 They allow females to win when they otherwise wouldn’t, and in doing so, they erode at the socially constructed portion of their disability.246 Formal adoption of the view that being a woman is just about identity destroys  novak-djokovic-stumbles-into-some-thoughts-about-womens-1766131796 [https://perma.cc/UQ9Y-BFN9].

The Case for Continuing the Set-Aside Switching out sex for identity, including in competitive sport, could produce important benefits for the identity movement and certainly for the particular intersex and trans individuals involved. But it would also impede the achievement of competitive sport’s institutional goals. Despite the claims of some advocates and policymakers to the contrary, making this policy move in this particular space would be a costly exchange. Thus, the question is ultimately whether, on balance, the case for respecting identity outweighs the case for respecting biology. For some, it may be that enough progress has been made toward the goal of equality for females that promoting inclusion on the basis of identity is now more important.248 For others, it may be that promoting identity is always more important than promoting equality; we see this claim being made in other spheres.249 Or, contrary to the approach taken throughout this article, it may be that formal sex-blindness—you just don’t get to talk about my body—is viewed as the best vehicle to equality for females so that even if intersex and trans women sometimes tax this movement, it is important to stay the course.250 Each of these positions has merit and decisions by sport’s policymakers to adopt any or all of them as the basis to switch out sex for identity would be defensible. It is arguably the case that continuing the set-aside that is the women’s category, and retaining that as a females-only space, is a legal imperative in societies where equal protection doctrine is read to require affirmative measures to reduce, in particular, discrimination based on race and sex.251 Although   247.

In the United States Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational settings, including in high school and college sport, and it permits sex segregation as a means to assure females equal treatment under this law. Where defining “sex” as “identity” would defeat the purpose of the segregation, doing so would be unlawful. COLEMAN_CROSS REFERENCED (DO NOT DELETE) 2/26/2018  2:49 PM 112 LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS [Vol. 80:63 advocates have argued that identity ought also be included on that list, either as another protected class or as part of sex, they have yet to win this argument.252 Indeed, at the time of this writing, this debate is particularly contentious.253 Moreover, even if sex is understood to include identity—either because sex is switched out for identity for policy reasons or identity is understood to be biologically based and thus an aspect of sex—the law may still privilege the reproductive aspects of biology since these have traditionally been the basis for the subordination of women. Whether the set-aside is legally required or not, however, it is the best policy choice for sport and its associated stakeholders.  In a purely utilitarian sense, it does more and overwhelming good. The goals of the women’s category, which are met when it is protected, are to feature the highest, fastest, and strongest females and thereby to assure them and all females an equal-to-men’s chance at the tangible and intangible goods created by competitive sport.254 They also include spreading these goods throughout the world as a way more generally to raise women’s prospects. Societies have made a lot of progress against sex discrimination, particularly in the West, but it is a fact that females—numerically half of the world’s population—remain a vulnerable sub-population worldwide.255 Intersex and trans individuals are also vulnerable, but not nearly in the same numbers, not categorically, and not similarly for their physical vulnerabilities; in these respects, in the language of anti-discrimination law, they are not similarly situated. In these circumstances, societies do not have the luxury to indulge in the fiction—which will not have significant power outside of liberal democracies in any event—that sex does not exist. In these circumstances, we should not abandon the optics and the possibilities that come from showcasing success in competitive sport by women like swimmer and mother Dana Vollmer and “Shot Diva” Michelle Carter who are identifiable as successful females and who embrace their status as role models.256 Changing the terms of the category   252.

For example, we know that particularly for females and minorities, having role models “who look like us” matters to our perceptions of our own opportunities and value.

Protecting these interests outweighs the interests of individual intersex and trans women to participate in and win sports events as women. It is doubtful that their being able to do so is more broadly beneficial given the inevitable backlash that accompanies their entry into events, a backlash that muddies the optics for their purposes.257 But even if it is, because the stereotypes they need to counter are not based in any sense that they are physically fragile, there are other ways for them to accomplish these ends. On the other hand, participation and success in elite sport is truly a unique opportunity for females to combat the pervasiveness of damaging stereotypes. V MEANS-ENDS TAILORING Sex discrimination is sometimes a good or even the best policy choice. As Part II explains, where this is the case, sex classifications are legal so long as the tool used to distinguish males from females is carefully tailored so that no unnecessary harm or over- or under-inclusion results. Part IV argues that sex discrimination continues to be the best policy choice in the competitive sport space, where the affirmative action of setting aside the women’s category for females only operates in a number of ways to empower rather than subordinate them. This Part focuses on the nexus between sport’s institutional ends and the means that can most carefully and effectively achieve them. Specifically, it focuses on the question of what is careful and effective sex testing for competitive sport. The idea of sex testing is anathema to many because, even though this is not usually the case, it can be both physically and emotionally intrusive. Depending  examples.

Nevertheless, where sex discrimination is the best policy choice, some form of sex testing is inevitable. Ensuring that this testing is careful and effective given institutional mission is thus not only legally required; it is also the best way to minimize if not eliminate unnecessary intrusions. A. Sex and Sex Testing in General As Part III on the biology of sex and sex differentiation describes, primary and secondary sex characteristics almost always distribute bi-modally.258 That is, taking into consideration both intersex and trans people, and using the most generous reading of the best available evidence as of this writing, approximately 98% or more of the time, individuals have either all male primary and secondary sex characteristics, or all female primary and secondary sex characteristics, and they identify accordingly.259 Historically and across cultures, this bimodal distribution has resulted in a view of sex as binary, and thus of individuals as either male or female.260 It has also resulted in the view that these distinctions are scientifically clean and easily made.261 The combined incidence of intersex and trans people, together with the progressive movement to challenge our defaults and to interrogate the role of biology in the construction of gender, have appropriately complicated these longstanding views. We now understand that because sex characteristics do not always distribute bi-modally, sex itself—as representing the cluster of characteristics—is best described as binary with exceptions or not binary at all. Whether it is the former or the latter depends on one’s rhetorical preferences, which are themselves influenced by cultural, political, and disciplinary orientation. In other words, while the bi-modal distribution is a fact not a social construction, how we view and characterize that distribution is constructed. Those who say that sex is not binary often describe it as “messy” or “fluid” and both individual characteristics and the distribution as reflecting a “continuum,” a “spectrum,” or a “kaleidoscope.”262 For example, bioethicist and science historian Alice Dreger argues that sex characteristics are on a “spectrum   258.  See supra notes 100–104 and accompanying text.  259.  Id.  260.  Id.  261.  These perspectives are especially prevalent in circumstances where intersex and trans people are not seen or else dismissed as so aberrational that they are effectively erased. Indeed, the medical history of DSDs is largely the story of the effort to render intersex in particular invisible, to erase its traces, by conforming “doubtful bodies” to one or the other sex. See generally DREGER, HERMAPHRODITES AND THE MEDICAL INVENTION OF SEX, supra note 68 (examining the history in England and France); ELIZABETH REIS, BODIES IN DOUBT: AN AMERICAN HISTORY OF INTERSEX (2009) (examining the history in the United States).  262.

That is, if one imagines three people, one sex typical female, one intersex person, and one sex typical male, the rendering is persuasive. Once incidence is factored in, however, the impression that sex is binary is difficult to ignore. And male genitalia can only be seen to “blend imperceptibly” into female genitalia if their reproductive purpose—their semen   263.  Dreger, The Social Construction of Sex, supra note 262. See also CARRIE HULL, ONTOLOGY OF SEX: A CRITICAL INQUIRY INTO THE DECONSTRUCTION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF CATEGORIES 55 (2006). Alice Dreger is a bioethicist and historian of science whose scholarship on the biology and politics of sex is the most thoughtful and thorough I have encountered. Dreger is well known in part for her book HERMAPHRODITES AND THE MEDICAL INVENTION OF SEX, in which she explores the “discovery” followed by the medical erasure of intersex in France and England in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. See generally DREGER, HERMAPHRODITES AND THE MEDICAL INVENTION OF SEX, supra note 68. She further traces the legacy of that medical history into the modern period. Specifically, she demonstrates how “medical men” in that earlier time deliberately imposed the binary on “doubtful bodies” in an effort to conform them to traditional social norms about maleness and femaleness; at least some of this effort was politically—as opposed to culturally—driven, that is in opposition to contemporary challenges from individuals and groups who sought acceptance for non-traditional sex roles and sexuality. Id. at 91. It is difficult to disagree with Dreger’s assessment that the sex of intersex individuals has been erased and (re)constructed—literally and figuratively—so that they could be made to fit within the binary; and that in this respect, sex (theirs) has been socially constructed.  264.

Nevertheless, this approach does important work for affected individuals who are redefined as sex typical as a result. It also does important work for the identity movement, as it sets up the further argument that because sex is messy, so is sex testing. For example, it has been argued by some social scientists that because sex is not binary, or even “definable,” line drawing to distinguish males from females is “impossible.”269 This argument is primarily in service of the political goal that is switching out sex for identity; that is, if sorting males from females is an impossible exercise because sex characteristics are on a spectrum, we should classify people on different grounds.270 It is also about the difficulties of line drawing at the margins in general. Thus, some would have it that if the margins are troubled or slippery or include anomalies so that the line cannot be drawn exactly right, it should not be drawn at all. In these circumstances, it is often said that any particular cut would be “arbitrary” and so inherently “unfair” to those who would be excluded from benefits as a result.271 In any event, the net effect of these arguments is to cause at least some policy makers to question the necessity and scope of sex classifications and testing. In contrast, those who think of sex as binary with exceptions focus on the implications of the biological facts including on the incidence of sex typical to sex atypical individuals. Thus, although the binary may be slightly troubled at the margins by the <2% incidence of intersex and trans people, it is easily discernible because it is the clearest and truest representation of the data: more than 98% of us fit neatly on the male or female side of the binary. And, again, this incidence is not just noise. Sex differences may inform identity and so are important also for that reason, but they exist in the first instance as a reproductive and species imperative. Consistent with this imperative, we are mostly either (1) 46,XX-females with ovaries which produce eggs, estrogenic endocrine systems, and female primary and secondary sex characteristics which support the female life and reproductive cycle, or (2) 46,XY-males with testes which produce sperm, androgenic endocrine systems, and male primary and secondary sex characteristics—which support the male life and reproductive cycle.272 Approximately 2% or less of us are exceptions to this rule—we are distributed in between as to one or more sex characteristics—and are not so easily sorted. This rendering also does important cultural work, as the ubiquity of sex classifications suggests. Sex according to this model is easily defined and line drawing to separate males from females is neither impossible nor arbitrary. Indeed, in most cases,   269.

In more sophisticated medical settings, ultrasounds and related testing before birth can and do distinguish males from females based on genetic sex, gonadal sex, and phenotypic sex. And at birth, regardless of the sophistication of the setting, phenotypic sex is used, as it has across cultures and time, to do the same work. These “sex tests” are not usually considered physically or psychologically intrusive, and neither are the routine verifications of identity documents—another form of “sex test”—that occur over time based on that earlier work. The tests are not error free, but they are highly accurate and reliable: they always capture sex typical individuals, and although it happens, it is unusual for someone who is sex atypical to have been identified as typical at birth. The evaluation is more complicated and intrusive for the small number of individuals who present atypically. Still, in modern medical settings, relevant experts do this work all the time and again, the line drawing involved is neither impossible nor arbitrary. Thus, in sophisticated medical settings, at birth it is medical standard of care for endocrinologists and specialists in DSD to use a differential diagnosis that derives the facts about the infant’s genetic sex, gonadal and endocrine sex, and phenotypic sex to establish biological sex and the DSD at issue.273 The latter is necessary because many DSDs have important health effects and the majority of those born with DSD are affected by conditions in this category.274 This diagnostic procedure effectively resolves biological sex one way or the other, except in very rare cases of ovo-testicular disorder, also known as “true hermaphroditism,” in which the individual has both testes and ovaries.275 Thus, as Part III’s discussion of CAH, POS, 5-ARD, and PAIS illustrates, once one looks past external genitalia, individuals who present ambiguously are almost always male or female—their genetic, gonadal, and endocrine sex line up.276 Biological sex and developmental anomalies are then used in consultation with the infant’s parents to establish their legal and social sex.277 What they choose to do, including what physicians recommend, often depends on cultural norms related to the ambiguities at issue; the latter may also be relevant to the individual’s own decision when they face it later in life.278 But again, the   273.

For example, in some cultures male children regardless of penis size are more highly valued than female children, whereas in others, males are considered likely to be socially successful only if they have a penis in the typical range.

The diagnostic standard of care COLEMAN_CROSS REFERENCED (DO NOT DELETE) 2/26/2018  2:49 PM 118 LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS [Vol. 80:63 diagnostic procedure works well to establish the basic biology from which they will work.279 Ultimately, whether we say that sex is binary or not is less important than the fact that where sex is institutionally relevant, line drawing will continue to be important. And because this work treads on sensitive ground, it needs to be done carefully and effectively. Here, carefully means with due care and attention to the physical, psychological, and cultural intrusions that may be entailed. And effectively means with due care and attention to the reasons for the intrusions; the latter must be tailored to those reasons and must not be unnecessarily over- or under-inclusive. As with line drawing at troubled margins in general, most of us are comfortable with reasoned cuts. And as Alice Dreger has noted in the context of sport in particular, the view that “sex is messy” does not preclude us from “com[ing] up with a clear set of rules for sex typing” based on a “deci[sion about] which of the dozens of characteristics of sex matter” to the institution and circumstances at issue.280 Reasoned cuts on these bases are the bread and butter of decision-making by individuals and regulators alike; this is perhaps especially true in sport which is literally all about lines. B. Sex Testing for Competitive Sport: Testes and an Androgenic Endocrine System Including Bioavailable Testosterone Outside the Female Range Competitive sport has consistently sought to exclude male bodies from female sport as a way to showcase the best female athletes, to afford them and institutional stakeholders the benefits that flow from winning in this space, and to contribute to the eradication of sex discrimination more generally. As Part III on the biology of sex and sex differentiation explains, the sex characteristics that matter for this purpose are testes and an androgenic endocrine system including bioavailable testosterone outside of the female range.281 The former produce the latter, which builds a male body beginning in utero and then in puberty, and which sustains it in related respects throughout adulthood.282 So long as sport does not go beyond its needs, careful and effective sex testing in this space is therefore not complicated, as it requires establishing the existence, or not, of just these two characteristics, neither of which happens to be messy or to blend imperceptibly into their female analogs.283 That is, it is exceedingly rare  is evolving in the current period also to take account of how the individual is likely to identify. See supra note 96 and accompanying text.  279.  Parents in more rudimentary medical settings do not have the benefit of the detailed diagnostic, but when their infants present with genital ambiguities, they also base their decisions as to their children’s legal and social identity in part on cultural norms. See supra notes 86–99 and accompanying text (discussing this practice).  280.  Alice Dreger, Where’s the Rulebook for Sex Verification?, N.Y.

Endocrinologists and related medical professionals may use the term “gonadal sex” to describe these characteristics in combination.  282.  Id.  283.

As a result, sex typing on these grounds is narrowly tailored to the institution’s goals and exceedingly unlikely to result in false positives and under- or over-inclusion. Thus, the women’s category would be open to all athletes who are biologically female, that is, to everyone with ovaries and not testes. This would include females with CAH and PCOS whose T levels rise above the top of the female reference range if their conditions’ adverse health effects did not preclude their athletic endeavors.  It would also be open to some intersex athletes with 46,XY DSD, including those with complete androgen insensitivity (AIS) as well as those who were diagnosed with partial androgen insensitivity (PAIS) and 5-alpha reductase deficiency (5-ARD) who had gonadectomies before the passage of puberty. The category would also be open to trans women who had gonadectomies and/or T suppression therapy before the passage of puberty. It would not be open to intersex and trans athletes who had testes and testosterone in the male range through puberty, since the point of the women’s category in elite sport is to provide a space free of competition from athletes with male bodies. Although it would require these athletes to compete in the men’s category as adults even if they identified as women and thus would cause them individual harm, pegging the rule to the pubertal period provides two important sets of assurances.288  The first is that the larger group of athletes who compete as women are not disadvantaged, and the institutions that seek to promote the strength and capacities of the female body through women’s sport are not hindered in this societal project by the inclusion of bodies that developed as  clitoromegaly may blend. These particular sex traits are irrelevant for sports’ purposes except as a flawed proxy for gonadal and endocrine sex.  284.  See supra note 275 and accompanying text.  285.  See supra Part III.  286.  See supra note 45 and accompanying text.  287.  See supra notes 74–80.  288.

There are not many elite sports that involve pre-pubescent athletes, but there are some, for example, gymnastics. Fiduciaries for athletes in these sports might be swayed by eligibility requirements to push for their charges to undergo otherwise premature gonadectomies and hormone suppression therapy. The medical community, the medical standard of care, and medical ethics are probably the most effective bulwarks against any abusive proxy decision making in this setting.

Establishing the existence of testes and testosterone outside of the female range is also easily done as a clinical matter. Anti-doping screens using blood and urine that include T level screens are already in place, and already ethically and lawfully flag individuals competing as women who are suspicious for doping or male biology.290 Where those screens yield a T level outside of the female range, the athlete is already ethically and lawfully subject to further examination to establish the cause of the elevated reading.291 Where the concern is sex not doping, the further examination is intrusive, but it should be less and certainly no more intrusive than a standard woman’s physical. Thus, these two sex characteristics can be established quickly and easily by a physician of the athlete’s choosing. A spot check will reveal descended or partially descended testes, an ultrasound will reveal undescended testes, and further laboratory analysis of fluid samples will establish the bioavailability of their testosterone. So long as all of this work is consistent with established medical protocols and ethics, which include respect for the patient and their privacy, it should be acceptable other than to those who reject sex as the basis for classification and thus would find any sex testing protocol anathema. The ease with which this clinical process can be undertaken does not account for the inevitable psychological intrusion that any surprising and unwanted inquiry into an issue so intimate as sex entails. Sport must take this concern seriously, especially because it operates around the world in many places where athletes are not accustomed to any kind of medical examination, where sex taxonomies and gender roles are deeply traditional, and where the athletes may not be able to avoid related publicity. It has botched this piece of its work badly in the past and has caused significant harm in the process.292 It needs to get this   289.  Cf. Joanna Harper, Athletic Gender, 80 LAW & CONTEMP.

The personal stories of Caster Semenya and Dutee Chand are particularly well known in this regard, but they are certainly not the only athletes who have been harmed by badly designed and implemented protocols in the past. I take the position here that athletes with their biology should not be included in the women’s category, but I agree without reservation that the way they were treated in the process of their evaluations was indefensible. See Elsas, supra note 81, at 250–52 (summarizing the history of sex testing in Olympic sport); Anna Kessel, Caster Semenya Wins Gold but Cannot Escape Gender Controversy, GUARDIAN (Aug. 19, 2009), https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/19/caster-semenya-800m-world-athletics-championships-gender [https://perma.cc/XE3H-GMEY] (summarizing Semenya’s story through 2009); Ariel Levy, Either/Or: Sports, Sex, and the Case of Caster Semenya, NEW YORKER (Nov. 30, 2009), https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/30/eitheror  [https://perma.cc/UQ8R-6DMW] (same); Donald McRae, The Return of Caster Semenya: Olympic Favourite and Ticking Timebomb, GUARDIAN (July 29, 2016),  https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ COLEMAN_CROSS REFERENCED (DO NOT DELETE) 2/26/2018  2:49 PM No. 4 2017] SEX IN SPORT 121 right. What this means is that although sport has no business meddling in aspects of the athlete’s biology or psychology that are unrelated to its mission, it should care that everyone who is subject to sex testing under its protocols is treated with respect, and that no one is unnecessarily harmed by its rules and procedures. Although athletes put their bodies including their sex in issue when they choose to compete, and thus have very different reasonable expectations of physical privacy than the average person,293 they are like the average person in that sex is profoundly relevant to their lives beyond sport. Whether the choice to care results from a codification of a certain ethics or simply attention to public and political pressure and the value of sport’s various projects and brands, those tasked with questioning and establishing the athlete’s “sports sex”—or what Joanna Harper calls “athletic gender”—must be attentive to those broader implications.294 Caring in this context doesn’t require sport to guarantee that no one’s feelings will be hurt, but it does require that the foreseeable impacts of sex testing be mitigated. At a minimum, this means educating teams, coaches, and athletes ex ante about the rules so that athletes are not put into competitive situations in which they don’t belong; being honest with athletes who are subject  2016/jul/29/the-return-of-caster-semenya-olympic-favourite-and-ticking-timebomb [http://perma.cc/95YE-8X45] (same); Padawer, supra note 125 (summarizing Chand’s and other stories).  293.  Choosing to be an elite athlete is choosing to put the relevant details of your body in issue. Competitive sport is ultimately about bodies, how they work, how they could be made to work better, and the hands that would be on them to help them succeed. Short of sex testing, athletes provide urine under supervision and have that and their blood tested for a range of substances and processes. See, e.g., U.S. ANTI-DOPING AGENCY, TESTING, https://www.usada.org/testing/ [https://perma.cc/E2JY-XSG6] (last visited Oct. 12, 2017) (summarizing urine and blood testing programs); WORLD ANTI-DOPING AGENCY, PROHIBITED LIST (2017). Finally, depending on the sport and the contract terms, a more complete physical exam is required. See, e.g., David Siebert, An Inside Look into the NFL Medical Exam Process at the Combine, BLEACHER REP. (Feb. 21, 2014), http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1968230-an-inside-look-into-the-nfl-medical-exam-process-at-the-combine [https://perma.cc/6E38-5GNJ]. For liability and drug testing purposes, high school athletes in the U.S. are increasingly subject to all of these as a routine matter. See, e.g., SAPULPA PUB. SCHS., REQUIRED ATHLETIC FORMS, http://www.sapulpaps.org/d_e_p_a_r_t_m_e_n_t_s/athletics/required_athletic_participation_information [https://perma.cc/78HD-7G4D] (last visited Oct. 12, 2017) (summarizing the school district’s sports physical and drug testing requirements). Given their health and safety rationales, there is no doubt that sports physicals are lawful; and the constitutionality of schools’ drug testing requirements has been upheld by the United States Supreme Court. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 666 (1995); see also Doriane Lambelet Coleman, The Ironic Costs of a Child Welfare Exception to the Fourth Amendment, 47 WM. & MARY L. REV. 413, 516 (2005) (explaining that children have a reduced expectation of privacy at school). Like gynecological exams, sex testing is invasive in ways that are different from urine and blood tests and sports physicals; but the latter are also invasions of privacy that may expose deeply personal and otherwise protected health information and lifestyle details. While most people may have both the expectation and the right to decline to be examined in these ways, elite athletes do not.  294.  I think that this incredibly helpful term was coined by Ross Tucker, a South African sports scientist who has followed and written on Semenya’s case in extraordinary detail since 2009. Tucker has been sport’s “Explainer in Chief” of the science associated with introducing genetic males with DSD into the women’s category. Among Tucker’s many important contributions has been his willingness publicly to take on the social scientists and advocates who have worked to obscure the scientific facts and bullied contrary voices in the process. See, e.g., Tucker, The Caster Semenya Debate, supra note 116 (discussing these attacks); see also Harper, supra note 289, at 151 (using the term “athletic gender”).

In the end, it is important that sport not shy away from this work simply because it can be politically sensitive and personally intrusive. Retaining sex as the basis for classification is lawful and in some circumstances may even be legally required.295 This work is also necessary for sport to meet its institutional goals which have broad and deep public support.296 Perhaps most important, if the history of sex testing in sport reveals anything it is that proxies for sex and specifically for testes and bioavailable testosterone are flawed and imperfect, and cause both the institution and especially its athlete stakeholders significant unnecessary harm.297 This is as true of the modern clinical approaches as it was of the crude nude line-ups that characterized the earlier periods.298 Thus, the IOC and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) had the best of intentions when, in 2011 in the wake of pressure following the mishandling of South African runner Caster Semenya’s case,299 they announced that they would no longer question an athlete’s sex or gender and would allow those who identified as women to compete in the women’s category so long as their T levels were at least below the bottom of the male reference range.300 As others have commented, this was a very “generous”—to intersex athletes—compromise.301 But it undoubtedly created a mess that the organizations are still working to clean up.302 This proxy, known as the “hyperandrogenism rule,” is flawed and incomplete scientifically because it only tests for one characteristic among the set of characteristics that constitute a male body303 and it draws the line at a point that   295.

In the meantime, intersex athletes have been permitted to compete without altering their T levels. Although advocates for the athletes and for intersex and trans rights believe this is the right result, because these athletes have gone on to win highly publicized women’s events including at the Olympic Games, it has wreaked havoc within competitive sport.

COLEMAN_CROSS REFERENCED (DO NOT DELETE) 2/26/2018  2:49 PM No. 4 2017] SEX IN SPORT 123 a female can only reach by doping.304 Indeed, under the rule, males with DSD and male-to-female trans athletes are permitted to compete in the women’s category with almost three times the T levels of non-doped females.305 It is also legally flawed because it does not propose to sort males from females but rather among individuals, all of whom identify as women, according to their T levels. Because an individual’s T levels are only one among a number of factors that contribute to athletic performance on a given day, it is difficult to justify reliance only on those levels to sort among a group of individuals we have all agreed ex ante are “women.”306 For example, if the group consists of elite females and non-elite males, a lot of factors in addition to the day’s T levels will affect the outcome. In other words, scientifically the means-ends nexus is not especially close. Finally, as implemented, the hyperandrogenism proxy is harmful to everyone concerned: It requires male-to-female trans athletes and males with DSD who identify as women to reduce their T levels using non-medically indicated means if they wish to compete as women.307 And it introduces male bodies into female competition with all of the repercussions to the competitors, the event, and sport’s goals that this entails.308 The hyperandrogenism rule can still be defended on the grounds that the means-ends nexus is close enough since testosterone is related to performance309 and any performance gap between females and athletes with high T levels who identify as women is significant if it means females are not competitive for the win.310 This is especially likely to be persuasive to those who are willing to trade some measure of scientific accuracy for physical privacy: testing for testosterone is less intrusive than testing for testes and certainly less intrusive than the standard differential diagnostic for DSD. Indeed, the Court of Arbitration for Sport has indicated that with adequate empirical support, these arguments will do.311 But as it has also suggested, this approach is unnecessarily torturous;   304.

The right to compete should not include the right to compete as a woman if it defeats the goals of the women’s category. VI CONCLUSION There’s no real reason for there to there to be a man and a woman category in acting. . . . It’s not track and field. You don’t have to separate ‘em. Robert de Niro has never said, “I’d better slow this acting down so Meryl Streep could catch up.”313  The question whether reading sex out of law and policy is a good or bad idea depends at least in part on whether biology is relevant to the fulfillment of the particular institutional mission at issue. For example, it would be a mistake to assume that it can be read out of elite sports policy without causing a lot of important harm because biology determines competitiveness in this institutional space which is precisely about competition. Thus, despite the arguments of some social scientists to the contrary, even the best female athletes are not competitive for the win against elite and many non-elite males.314 This means that if sex classifications are abandoned here, either entirely or in favor of classifications based on gender identity, female athletes would almost always lose to males and both sport and society would lose many of the practical and expressive benefits that inure from including and celebrating females in competitive sport. This is as true of athletes at the highest echelons like Serena Williams and Katie Ledecky as it is of the development athletes in high school, college, and beyond who aspire to take their place. Sport may be special in this respect, but it is surely not sui generis. For example, sex and its associated biology will likely always be relevant in clinical and research medicine because the goals of those institutions are to diagnose and treat disease and generally to contribute to the maintenance of physical health. Regardless of how people identify, male and female bodies are different in their physiology, in the way diseases and conditions present, and in their response to treatment. Because of this, even if personalized medicine becomes the norm, like competitive sport, medicine could not fulfill its objectives if it had to ignore sex. This does not mean that clinical and research medicine are free to ignore gender identity in their dealings with patients and research subjects since success in this space also has a lot to do with respecting the whole person. But it does mean that erasing sex would be destructive of the institutions’ core mission.   312.  Dutee Chand, CAS 2014/A/3759, at ¶ 514 (“It is not in dispute that it is appropriate to segregate athletic competition into male and female categories.”). CAS added that “this may require policing and give rise to difficult decisions when nature does not divide into these categories so simply”; but it clearly does not see these “difficult decisions” as prohibitive.

COLEMAN_CROSS REFERENCED (DO NOT DELETE) 2/26/2018  2:49 PM No. 4 2017] SEX IN SPORT 125 Other contexts are not as obvious and it is in these settings that adopting a careful, fact-based approach to sex that tracks the structure used in this article can be especially helpful. This approach is based in well-established anti-discrimination law and requires attention to inherent biological differences, institutional mission, and the closeness of the means-ends nexus. It is legally mandated for institutions that are specifically subject to this law.315 But it is also useful beyond law, in the development of private sector policy choices. Despite the political and financial chaos around measures such as North Carolina’s so-called “bathroom bill,” the thorniest of these questions in this period is not whether it is mission-critical to retain sex as the basis for classification into public restrooms.316 Although religion will sometimes provide a different answer, on the facts this matter easily resolves in favor of erasing sex or else reading in gender.317 Rather, the difficult questions involve the continued relevance of sex to institutions such as recreational sport,318 education,319   315.  For example, it will provide the template for any analysis of the costs of reading sex out of and identity into actuarial tables incorporated into state laws on the establishment of civil damages. These laws currently permit sex (and race) discrimination in the valuation of life and disability. A bill “[t]o prohibit a court from awarding damages based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or actual or perceived sexual orientation” has been introduced in the U.S. Congress but has not been enacted. See Fair Calculations in Civil Damages Act of 2016, H.R. 6417, 114th Cong. (2016).  316.  See; Mark Abadi, North Carolina Has Lost a Staggering Amount of Money over its Controversial ‘Bathroom Law’, BUS.

Sex classifications are not mission-critical to the functionality of public restrooms because we can and do use either effectively when necessary. Nor does the switch make it impossible for the institutions that support them to provide for the safety or privacy of their entrants. There is no evidence that trans people are more likely to be physically or sexually aggressive than people who are not trans; to the contrary, the evidence that exists is clear that the former are particularly likely to be the victims of violence perpetrated by the latter. (I looked but could only find evidence of the unsubstantiated concern that trans-boys and men were a risk to females. See, e.g., Alia E. Dastigar, The Imaginary Predator in America’s Transgender Bathroom War, USA TODAY (Apr. 28, 2016), https://www.usatoday.com/story/ news/nation/2016/04/28/transgender-bathroom-bills-discrimination/32594395/ [https://perma.cc/CG3A-DUHE]; Katy Steinmetz, Everything You Need to Know about the Debate over Transgender People and Bathrooms, TIME (July 28, 2015), http://time.com/3974186/transgender-bathroom-debate/ [https://perma.cc/E2RT-EPG6]. The big safety issue in female bathrooms remains the mean girls who have always used them as their safe bullying space. See, e.g., MICHELE BORBA, THE 6RS OF BULLYING PREVENTION: BEST PROVEN PRACTICES TO COMBAT CRUELTY AND BUILD RESPECT 28–29 (2017) (listing bathrooms as a “mean girl” bullying hotspot); 3 Girls Charged after Teen Beaten to Death in School Bathroom, WNEP (May 9, 2016), http://wnep.com/2016/05/09/3-girls-charged-after-teen-beaten-to-death-in-school-bathroom/ [https://perma.cc/5MBH-3CH4]. In contrast, physical privacy is a legitimate concern because reasonable expectations are based in community norms and sex-segregated public restrooms remain the norm. But this just means that the switch is not cost-free, not that it is cost prohibitive. Having to retrofit restrooms to provide individual space won’t affect institutional ends.   318.  See e.g., Buzuvis, supra note 6, at 158 (noting that sex-segregation in recreational sports has developed more from a desire to “cultivate a particular social experience and community” rather than for physical or biological reasons, supporting the argument that gender is more decisive for inclusion than biological sex).   319.  For example, all-women’s colleges and co-educational institutions seek in their admissions processes and classroom practices to balance their male and female student populations and then sometimes to provide sex-segregated spaces for particular purposes. These institutions have only recently COLEMAN_CROSS REFERENCED (DO NOT DELETE) 2/26/2018  2:49 PM 126 LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS [Vol. 80:63 insurance,320 and national security,321 all of which have a history of relying on sex for a complex of reasons that include administrative efficiency and stereotype, but also inherent biological differences. This analysis of sex in sport provides the template for the development of the facts and arguments necessary to resolve these and related questions in a way that ensures that we properly distinguish mission-critical discriminations from those that are both unnecessary and unnecessarily harmful to already vulnerable sub-populations.   begun to have to articulate their goals in these respects. And unlike competitive sport and medicine, the argument that sex differences are mission critical is more complicated for them to make. For example, all-women’s colleges must determine whether they exist in part to provide a separate space for female bodies and the developmental experiences uniquely associated with those bodies, or whether it is to provide a separate space for individuals with a “female brain” regardless of their below-the-neck biology.
