Aside from the wide-ranging anti-corruption investigations that have cowed other officials, experts also point to the marginalization of rival political factions within the Party structure, the demotions of those who “do not see eye to eye with Xi” and heightened scrutiny of business interests of those deemed insufficiently loyal.

It is not a coincidence that human rights lawyers and NGO activists working on rights issues are the hardest hit in the broad crackdown against Chinese civil society. 16  This Article argues that fundamentally this is a sharp attack to deny the political and civic space needed for the contestation of ideas, and to suppress those that dare to reveal human rights abuses – that is, those that reveal “negative stories” about China that challenge the positive image that the government is seeking to project. Nor is it a coincidence that Xi’s vision of global governance under Chinese leadership involves pushing the concept of “a people-centered development philosophy” as an alternative model to the international human rights legal system underpinned by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.17 This Article argues that such moves are a serious attempt to move the battlegrounds for rights lawyering and rights promotion away from the legal system and the policy-making arena, into the sphere of public opinion, which can be  14.

This Article will examine the broader legal, regulatory and social context within which rights lawyering in China occurs, especially as it affects the political and civic space within which values are promoted and narratives are shaped. It begins by contextualizing the emergence of rights lawyering in the early 2000s, looking at several factors that supported the mobilization of lawyers and other activists advocating for different kinds of human rights through the Chinese legal system. It then turns to recent trends in the political and legal frameworks that influence the space for rights lawyering, starting with an analysis of Xi’s vision for a new era in China’s history, and the shift from winning within the courts to shaping the narrative in the public opinion sphere. Finally, this Article examines the possible impact of these shifts on the rights lawyering and grassroots mobilization in the areas of LGBTQ rights and women’s rights. II. RIGHTS LAWYERING AND LEGAL MOBILIZATION IN CONTEXT Scholarship about lawyers as a profession in China, civil society activism and grassroots mobilization has flourished even as the political environment for the subjects of such scholarship is rapidly changing. Experts have studied Chinese lawyers’ work methodologies, their daily experiences in courts, scrutinized constitutional litigation cases, and analyzed how Chinese lawyers and law firms are regulated.18 A body of scholarship around what I would collectively call “rights lawyering” is also developing, with several seminal works in recent years that look closely at the motivations and experiences of different groups of lawyers. Scholars have adopted different taxonomies of the legal profession19 and examined several institutional and social factors  18. See Terence C. Halliday & Sida Liu, Birth of a Liberal Moment? Looking through a OneWay Mirror at Lawyers’ Defense of Criminal Defendants in China in FIGHTING FOR POLITICAL FREEDOM: COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF THE LEGAL COMPLEX AND POLITICAL LIBERALISM 65-107 (Terence C. Halliday et al. eds., 2007) (discussing the use of Article 306 of the 1997 PRC Criminal Law to detain, prosecute or convict lawyers under the crime of “lawyer’s perjury” and its retaliatory use in practice against defense lawyers). 19. See, e.g., EVA PILS, CHINA’S HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS: ADVOCACY AND RESISTANCE (2014) (analyzing the experiences of human rights lawyers in Chinese law and politics); SIDA LIU & TERENCE HALLIDAY, CRIMINAL DEFENSE IN CHINA: THE POLITICS OF LAWYERS AT WORK 6-7 (2016) (analyzing criminal defense lawyers in China and their methods of working). Liu and Halliday present a taxonomy of lawyers including: progressive elites, 1116 FORDHAM INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL [Vol. 41:5 for the emergence of lawyers and other rights advocates who are “willing[] and ab[le] . . . to stand out, speak out, and act out in addressing public policy issues through litigation.”20 These taxonomies are not mutually exclusive, because they seek to categorize the evolving motivations, conduct, cases, strategies of lawyers who interact with, influence, and are influenced by, their peers and their external environment. Moreover, while some lawyers may proactively identify themselves with certain groups of lawyers (i.e. human rights lawyers, 21  weiquan [ 维 权  rights-protection or rights defense] lawyers,22 “die-hard” lawyers,23 or public interest lawyers) as a means of establishing their own networks, others adopt similar approaches or share similar ideals but eschew labels to mitigate risk. While a full analysis of these different categories (both ascribed and self-perceived) is beyond the scope of this Article, I use “rights lawyering” to encompass a wide range of lawyering activities with several shared characteristics. First, it involves legal advocacy focusing on interests that are broader than those of an individual case or the interests of an  pragmatic brokers, political activists, and routine practitioners. For Chinese criminal defense lawyers, they further differentiate the category of political activists into two types: notable activists (referring to a small group of lawyers that “proactively seek out politically sensitive cases and challenge arbitrary state power”) and grassroots activists (referring to “ordinary lawyers all over China who possess politically liberal values and motivations but do not mobilize collectively due to unfavorable structural constraints . . . [but] use their everyday . . . work to pursue substantive legal-political goals of protecting the basic legal rights of citizens through practices of proceduralism”). Id. at 6-7. 20. See Fu Hualing & Richard Cullen, The Development of Public Interest Litigation in China, in PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION IN ASIA 1 (Po Jen Yap et al. eds., Routledge 2010) (defining public interest lawyering). 21. Note that the terms used by scholars to label Chinese lawyers can be different from how they perceived or organized themselves. For example, Eva Pils uses “human rights lawyer” and “rights lawyer” interchangeably, although her work primarily focused on weiquan lawyers. See Bochen Han, China’s Human Rights Lawyers: Political Resistance and the Law, THE DIPLOMAT (Feb. 11, 2016), https://thediplomat.com/2016/02/chinas-human-rights-lawyers-political-resistance-and-the-law/ [https://perma.cc/L3M3-B5J2]. 22.

One important structural factor is the rapid proliferation of laws and regulations in the rebuilding of China’s legal system from 1978 onwards and the accompanying professionalization of lawyers.26 The 1996 PRC Lawyers Law27 officially marked the privatization of the legal profession, moving away from lawyers being state legal workers to lawyers with professional identity and ethics.28 One consequence of the building of the Chinese socialist legal system29 is that “law has become an important aspect of state ideology and of popular consciousness.” 30  The enshrinement of “rule of law” and “human rights” in the 2004 amendment of the PRC Constitution further entrenched these concepts in popular discourse,31 and provided space for rights defense activists. 32  Rule of law discourse also offered opportunities for cross-cultural exchange of ideas about the role of law within a society, including the role of China’s constitution and ideas related to individual civil rights.33  24.

Id.  1118 FORDHAM INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL [Vol. 41:5 Similarly, this process opened up political space for entrepreneurship in governance and legal reforms, allowing lawyers to play a role in demonstrating gaps in the legal framework and suggest possibility of reform. Liu and Halliday note that “lawyers who strive for basic legal freedoms often insist that this is only possible if state power itself is fractured, most importantly through some independence or autonomy of the judiciary, from control by the monarchy, the military, one-party leaders, or an executive branch of government, including the police—the domestic coercive arm of government itself.”34 Moreover, the proliferation of new laws also generated more instances where the differences in the law in text and the law in practice created opportunities for lawyers and their clients to hold government officials accountable to legal rhetoric.35 Experimentation was seen as facilitative of state interests in legal reform, not just in the promulgation of new laws at the local levels, but also in the “willingness of courts and local governments to take actions that at times contradict national rules or laws.”36 Therein lies opportunities for lawyers to bring new ideas to courts or legislators in order to expand or concretize certain rights. The Reform Era also saw vibrant civil society growth, with “[s]pace for civil activity enlarged by development of the market economy.” 37  Civil society activism helped to increase the “rights awareness of aggrieved individuals and their readiness to assert their rights,”38 broadening the pool of plaintiffs for lawyers, while lawyers’ engagement with NGOs working with marginalized communities also supported mutually beneficial relationships and increased innovation in how to engage with the state.39 Another aspect of this was the space within the legal academy for law professors and lawyers to shape public discourse about law; as Fu and Cullen note: “Academic lawyers have  34. LIU & HALLIDAY, supra note 19, at 4. 35. Fu and Cullen note that “inconsistency between legal rights and their routine violation in practice creates opportunities in the political and legal system for weiquan to develop.” Fu & Cullen, supra note 22, at 123 (citing KEVIN J.

Id. at 124. 2018] RIGHTS LAWYERING IN XI'S CHINA 1119 been crucial in promoting the concept of the constitutional and legal protections of rights.”40 A relatively open media landscape, including through internet news platforms, was also a contributing factor. With journalists and editors who are willing and able to write and publish on social justice issues, and legal news increasing in popularity,41 lawyers were able to use media attention as a way to influence public opinion on a particular case or a particular topic—and perhaps even encourage government intervention in favor of their clients or their clients’ communities.42 Technological advancements, especially on social media platforms, allow for greater ease of communications across China and, with it, the spread of legal knowledge.43 The exponential growth in Internet users and the use of mobile technology in China also increased the ability of lawyers to organize themselves—to build connections with other like-minded lawyers outside the bounds of geography, to discuss cases and legal strategies, and to broadcast their opinions44—both in furtherance of cases and for community mobilization should an activist/lawyer face threats. Social media is particularly important for activist lawyers, as it offers a platform for lawyers to take their opinions and legal arguments to the general public, therefore bypassing traditional media outlets (newspapers or television reporting) that is heavily regulated.45 Scholars often use political positioning to describe lawyers’ motivations, decision-making and conduct—that is, differentiating  40. Fu & Cullen, supra note 22, at 113-14 (noting that law schools were particularly supportive practice sites for weiquan lawyering and noting leading weiquan lawyers that were professors whose “university position allows them the freedom, financial and otherwise, to play an active role in weiquan lawyering,” including He Weifang, Xu Zhiyong, Teng Biao and Fan Yafeng from the Law Institute, China Academy of Social Sciences, Zhou Wei from Sichuan University). 41 .

See, e.g., LIU & HALLIDAY, supra note 19, at 74 (“For highly sensitive cases . . . on which no official Chinese media would report, some notable activists in Beijing sometimes use Internet blogs and microblogs or go directly to the international media . . . WeChat groups, which are more private than blogs and microblogs, have also become a popular tool for activist lawyers to provide support for like-minded colleagues in recent years.”) 45.

III. THE RESHAPING OF RIGHTS AND LAW IN XI’S CHINA Under the Xi administration, previous calculations of political acceptability and risks shifted dramatically, while methods of government repression are changing. While repression of civil society activism and rights lawyering was always part of the landscape under the Hu Jintao administration, Xi’s rise has “ushered in a campaign of repression against civil society characterized by national security rhetoric, the criminalization of threatening activism, and proactive repression.”48 Xi continues to preside over the most wide-ranging and sustained attack on civil society that China has seen since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in June 1989 as the state “aggressively police[s] boundary pushers.” 49 Rights-based NGOs suffered intense harassment, some forced to close their doors altogether, others to tamper down their activities or to continue to work underground.50  46.  Fu & Cullen, supra note 20, at 2 (“Radical lawyers are willing to take on politically sensitive cases, which the government regards as off limits, ready to mobilize media and NGOs, and prepared to work with foreign entities.”) 47. See Liu & Halliday supra note 19, at 90 (“Since the zealous advocacy of activist lawyers can readily be construed as acts of political subversion, the defenders of the Party-state deploy an array of weapons in their armories to silence, quash, domesticate, marginalize, isolate, or exile these stubborn defenders of the weak. The personal costs of rights advocacy and defense have been widely reported in the media and analyzed by scholars . . . namely, professional sanctions, state security repression, and violence of the black mafia.”) 48.

Xi’s China: Personalization of Power and Impact on Civil Society The personalization of power under Xi Jinping has not only changed the structure of the Chinese government, it has also significantly curtailed the space for diverse ideas and discourse. Xi Jinping “has made himself the chairman of everything”52 and injected party control into areas that were relatively independent for the last two decades. For example, the reintroduction of party cells into many different sectors – including private companies, schools at all levels53 and even law firms—is intended to ensure that discipline and monitoring is done from the inside. Moreover, the merger of party and state institutions54 seeks to close structural gaps between central and local governments so that central Party prerogatives and state governance are more aligned.55 This will likely reduce the space for rights lawyers to exploit opportunities that derive from the “de facto pluralistic nature of today’s OPS [one party state].”56 There is also increased control of different actors who offer alternative poles of influence, in part to institute ideological control and to ensure that the Party leads reform efforts and shapes narratives about contemporary and historical events. It is well-documented that universities are under tight political control, and that professors—once seen to be relatively insulated from political reprisal because of social  51. Alex W.

Role of Law and Lawyers in Xi’s China Although rights lawyers often emphasize law as a tool of reform, law can also be a tool of oppression and repression. In recent years, the high-octane push for law-making to improve the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics60 also included a dragnet of laws aimed at preventing social disruption, regulating behavior and punishing those who challenge government prerogative. 61  The March 2018 constitutional amendments have added a new phrase “socialist rule by law” to the CCP’s governing philosophy—moving away from “rule of law” language to “rule by law” also dispenses with the veneer of judicial independence, and marking a return to the Marxist/Leninist view that “courts should be a tool of party control.”62 This is also  57.

Lawyers may not make “misleading” or “malicious” comments about any cases, publish or sign joint letters, or gather “virtually” or in person to “attack or slander” the judicial system. Lawyers are barred from “gathering crowds to make a fuss,” insulting judicial officers, “denying the nature of cults when the state has already determined them as such,” or other behaviors that “disturb court order.” They also cannot use the Internet and the media to “provoke discontent against the Party and the state” or “instigate” people to file lawsuits to “destabilize social stability.”66  63.

Rights Discourse in Xi’s China There is also a significant shift in Chinese governmental attitudes towards international engagement, and particularly towards state rhetoric about international ideas and values. Authorities are seeking to combat undesirable ideological trends through limiting the influence of so-called “Western ideas” (including universal values like human rights, civil society and “the West’s view of media”67) and increasing control of how Chinese civil society actors engage with international partners. The CCP has increased its rhetoric naming “foreign forces” as major threats to China’s domestic stability, while accusing foreign powers of attempts to undermine China’s rise.68 It has branded those who dare to question the CCP’s agenda as agents of foreign powers and expanded legal definitions of “hostile groups” to include any group that challenges the power of the CCP, China’s socialist system or the Chinese government.69 For example, in 2017, the Chinese government broadened the Counter-Espionage Law to include conduct deemed subversive or threatening to national security like the issuing of information that harms China’s national security, or meeting with individuals that harm national security 70 —activities which are not traditionally deemed to be espionage. The Chinese government has also made disrespect to state symbols (like the national flag and anthem) or CCP heroes and leadership punishable offences.71  67.

Since 2015, the Chinese authorities have launched an unprecedented campaign to shape public opinion against human rights activists—and consequently, human rights ideas—through the state-run media.72 National television outlets and state-run newspapers, which used to censor all references of human rights lawyers, have launched a coordinated smear campaign seeking to undermine and discredit the work of human rights lawyers and activists. Human rights lawyers are now painted as radical and working as an “organized criminal gang.” 73  Working with disenfranchised populations (including petitioners, many of whom are citizen activists) is now cast as subversive;74 while the use of social media to call attention to cases of injustice is used as evidence of sinister intent.75 In a troubling development, there has been an increase in the use of (coerced) confessions, 76 either televised on CCTV or disseminated via social media, as a way of assigning guilt without trial. 77  Moreover, this propaganda campaign also coopted Chinese media through the use of televised interviews or interviews with the  amendment/ [https://perma.cc/E9PH-PG49].

This coordinated campaign to project positive stories of China includes the creation of a new broadcast agency “Voice of China” which consolidates state run media outlets like China Central Television, China Global Television Network, China National Radio, and China Radio International, and which will report directly to the Party’s publicity department.85 The recent decision to dissolve the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television (“SAPPRFT”) and consolidate regulatory power over news, online content, and film under the Communist Party publicity department86 also indicates a shift in the propaganda campaign. It “signals tighter media control amid a broad crackdown on news, online content and film that goes against Party values under President Xi Jinping.”87 Similarly, reforms in 2017 and 2018 further centralized the regulatory landscape for social media and Internet platforms, including increasing the resources available to strengthen the censorship infrastructure through a central government agency. 88  Changes in regulations and increased censorship strengthened the Great Firewall, especially through significant limitations on the use of virtual private networks (“VPN”) software that allow users to access blocked information.89 As part of Xi Jinping’s “cyber sovereignty” campaign, government regulators required state-run telecommunications firms to  85 .

INNOVATION AND MARGINALIZATION: LGBTQ RIGHTS AND WOMEN’S RIGHTS RE-EXAMINED The intentional marginalization of rights-focused advocacy by Chinese authorities and the re-assertion of Party leadership over all aspects of life, including within the courts, mean that previous political calculations about rights lawyering and activism must be re-examined. Although Fu and Cullen noted that “an authoritarian state embraces weiquan lawyering when it takes on issues that do not threaten the state’s legitimacy,” 92 it is no longer clear what issues do not pose threats. We are now at an inflection point—how can right lawyers and activists best navigate the shifting political lines that determine the acceptability of (1) what advocacy issues activists can work on; (2) how they can advocate; and even (3) whom is allowed to speak? This Section considers how issues like LGBTQ rights and women’s rights, which were previously perceived as politically acceptable, are now in an uneasy status vis-à-vis the state. Women’s rights and LGBTQ rights lawyering offer useful sites of inquiry and comparison for several reasons. First, LGBTQ issues are intrinsically connected to issues related to gender and sexuality. Traditional gender stereotypes serve as impediments both to gender equality as well as LGBTQ equality because discrimination against individuals on account of gender roles or for perceived violations of gender norms.93  90.

Third, both women’s rights and LGBTQ rights issues were previously defined as “social issues” that are less politically sensitive, albeit for different reasons, but recent experiences demonstrate that the landscape shifted, and therefore is worth re-examining. A. Innovation in Legal Grey Areas As noted above, the mark of political acceptability is one that allows rights lawyers and activists a modicum of political cover for their actions. In the case of women’s rights and LGBTQ rights, it is a double-edged sword. Cast as social issues, they are not typically seen as core rights like civil and political rights (including freedom of speech and freedom of religion) and so have not always been taken up by high-profile rights lawyers. Yet, this also means that issues associated with gender and sexuality were not always readily attacked. For LGBTQ rights activists, invisibility is a major impediment—both in terms of invisibility within government policies and data, and invisibility within Chinese society.94 Yet, this invisibility may also be protective: activists posited that LGBTQ rights mobilization is not “intimidating” to the government because “the population is perceived to be so small in China.”95 Women’s rights were traditionally perceived as politically safe 96 —legal and policy advocacy on women’s rights issues like domestic violence, and even the land rights of rural women, has mostly been allowed to proceed unimpeded by the Chinese authorities. Not only does the government hold up gender equality as a central tenet of  94. See Joy L. Chia.

Most feminist activists believed that working on issues that reflected the daily lives of many women and which had widespread public support (for example, employment discrimination, sexual harassment on public transportation, discrimination in university admissions), would accord them some semblance of safety and allow them to avoid government attention and backlash.98 Chinese courts prove to be relatively welcoming to cases seeking to protect women and LGBTQ people from discrimination, perhaps due to the perception that anti-discrimination cases are not politically sensitive. Since 2013, several cases challenging gender-discriminatory practices have successfully been brought to court, including China’s first successful gender discrimination case finding that a Hangzhou city cooking school violated the plaintiffs’ right to equal employment by denying her application on account of her gender.99 A previous case against a Beijing education institute for refusing to consider a female college graduate for an administrative assistant job that was advertised as seeking only male applicants was settled in 2013 for 30,000 yuan.100 In 2015, similar cases were successfully brought against the Beijing Postal Service (the first such case against a state-owned enterprise) for the denial of an application because the headquarters did not wish to hire women as frontline postal workers,101 and against the blatantly  97.

This high profile lawsuit challenged the widespread use of “treatments” claiming to “cure” homosexuality—in its judgment, the Beijing court stated that homosexuality is not a disease and therefore did not need to be treated.103 In 2016, China’s first same-sex marriage lawsuit was brought in Changsha, Henan Province; although it was ultimately unsuccessful, it was remarkable that the case was brought and then accepted by the court in the first place.104 In 2017, China’s first successful case against involuntary hospitalization to undergo conversion therapy was won, with the Henan court ruling that the gay man was held against his will and subjected to regular physical abuse and forced treatment.105 In December 2016, Mr. C., a transgender man, won China’s first transgender employment discrimination case after a Guizhou court ruled he was illegally fired.106 B.

Although most were released after several hours of questioning, the authorities declined to release five young feminists (now known as the “Feminist Five”) and subjected them to tough interrogation and harsh treatment.107 Though they were released after 37 days, in great part due to high-profile domestic and international campaigns, 108  the chilling effect of the arrests on the feminist movement was undeniable. Authorities have drawn a clear line between working with women as a population and working on the human rights of women.  For LGBTQ activism, the threats have been less overt, but the consequences of government scrutiny are similar. 109  For example, domestic NGO regulations do not allow organizations working explicitly on LGBTQ rights to register with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, thereby “restrict[ing] the operational capacity of these groups to raise funds, attract human resources, and provide critical legal, psychological, and other services.”110 The passage of the Foreign NGO Management Law has also impacted LGBTQ groups disproportionately—for many LGBTQ activists, international funding is “the lifeblood of their organizations” 111  and foreign funding restrictions (based on source of funding and intended beneficiaries) have diverted resources away from LGBTQ rights.112  107 .

New regulations released by the Cyberspace Administration of China in May 2017 increased restrictions on acceptable content on mass communication and social media platforms, and subjected all services offered by online news portals and network providers to party-sanctioned editorial staff.113 In June 2017, regulations released by the China Netcasting Services Association lumped homosexuality together with sexual abuse and violence under the category of “abnormal sexual relationships,” and banned all references to homosexuality from online broadcasting.114 These changes sparked outrage within the LGBTQ community with an outpouring of online criticisms; the government responded by deleting such criticisms with further penalties: in the case of Li Yinhe, China’s leading sexologist, her critical commentary resulted in a three-month ban on Weibo.115 Though discussion of women’s rights issues is generally allowed by media censors, influential feminist alternative media accounts have been subject to government censorship and attack. In February 2017, the social media account of a leading feminist organization, Feminist Voices, was suspended for 30 days.116 On March 8, 2018, International Women’s Day, the account was shut down indefinitely, with its Weibo and WeChat public accounts (and their archives) deleted.117 Feminist Voices had more than 180,000 followers on Weibo and was very influential among young activist women.118 The silencing of Feminist  government’s monitoring of Chinese LGBT NGO relationships with international NGOs and other embassies in China – including pressure to reject funding from US embassy). 113.

V. CONCLUSION: INNOVATION IN THE MIDST OF MARGINALIZATION Xi Jinping’s vision of a rejuvenated China is one that is characterized by increasing authority in the international sphere (driven by economic power and a muscular militarism), and a prosperous, well-regulated Chinese society under the CCP’s authoritative leadership. Having presented its economic miracle as a model for developing countries, China is now poised to export its governing model, including the state-sponsored tools of social control, while the PRC government promotes alternative interpretations of international laws—including international human rights concepts and international norms of engagement. China’s assertiveness in the international sphere is matched by the Chinese authorities’ intolerance of those that disrupt the singular mythology of Chinese ascendancy. The government’s reaction to independent, vocal, and well-organized activists working to expand Chinese society’s ideas of gender equality and LGBTQ rights likely signals a wariness of the mobilization power of these two groups; and perhaps a recognition that such activism at their very core do fundamentally challenge the status quo. Rights lawyers and advocates working on gender and sexuality are presented with a conundrum: how to harness social perceptions that women’s rights and LGBTQ rights are politically non-threatening to their advantage. As the public space for discourse around the content of “human rights” and “universal values” constricts, the question for rights lawyers and activists is one of communications: how to deconstruct human rights concepts into their most basic ideas with broad public appeal—to learn how to communicate about ideas of justice, equality, and dignity in ways that the general public understands and supports.   119.
