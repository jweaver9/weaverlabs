(‘non-\nbinary’ defined here as anyone who identifies their gender as something other than \n‘always and exclusively male or always and exclusively female’). The study explores the \nlived realities of four non-binary identified transgender people living in Arizona. Each \nparticipant took a short survey and conducted a 45-minute in-person interview, conducted \nthrough phenomenological questioning to evoke deep descriptions of experience. After \nanalyzing the results through feminist hermeneutic phenomenology, this study suggests \nthat the experience of non-binary gender identity presents an essential pattern of \ncultivating self-realization. The essential themes of internal recognition, external \npresentation, and movement toward wellness fell into this pattern. The United States has \nconceptualized transgender identity in many ways, from pathologizing to politicizing, to \nmedically affirming views. Although the literature on this topic is quite small, there is no \ndoubt that non-binary transgender people exist in U.S. public life. Ultimately, if non-\nbinary people are to find affirming paths toward self-realization, they must be heard from \ntheir own experiences in their own voices.  \n\t ii\t\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nLIST OF FIGURES…………………………………………………………………….....v \nLIST OF TABLES………………………………………………………………………..vi \nCHAPTER \n     1   JUSTIFICATION FOR STUDY…………………………………………………...1 \n               Introduction……………………………………………………………………...1 \n    Importance of Researching Underrepresented Communities…………………...2 \n    Phenomenon of Non-Binary Gender Identity…………………………………...3 \n    Researcher Position……………………………………………………………...4 \n     2   MAPPING A CENTURY OF GENDER IN THE UNITED STATES.……………6 \n    3   REVIEW OF RELEVANT STUDIES…………………………………………….24 \n               Studies on Non-Binary Gender Identity……………………………………….24 \n               Phenomenological Studies About Transgender Identity…………………….....27 \n               Significance of the Phenomenological Study of Non-Binary Identity...............30 \n 4   METHODOLOGY…….…………………………………………………………..32 \n               Choosing Phenomenology.…………………………………………………….32 \n               Feminist Epistemology.………………………………………………………..33 \nPhenomenology as Method.……………………………………………………34 \n               Feminist Phenomenology as Method.………………………………………….36 \n  5   RESEARCH METHODS…….…………………………………………………...38 \n               Study Sample...…………..…………………………………………………….38 \n               Data Collection…………..…………………………………………………….39      \n\t iii\t\n      \nCHAPTER                                                                                                                      Page      \nPreliminary Surveys…………..……………………………………………….39      \nPhenomenological Semi-Structured Interviews…………..…………………...42    \nPhenomenological Analysis…………..……………………………………….44    \nPotential Limitations…………..……………………………………………….45             \n6   FINDINGS………………………………………………………………………....47   \nParticipant Narratives.………………………………………………………….47 \nResearcher’s Experience With Non-Binary Gender Identity…………………..51                         \n               Initial Reduction………………………………………………………………..53 \nEssential Patterns and Themes…………………………………………………54 \nTheme 1: Internal Recognition…………………………………………………55 \nSub-Theme A: Intuitive/Bodily Knowledge……………………………………56 \nSub-Theme B: Discovery of Possibility………………………………………..57 \nSub-Theme C: Rejecting the Binary……………………………………………59 \nTheme 2: External Presentation………………………………………………...61 \nSub-Theme A: Change in Relationships……………………………………….61 \nSub-Theme B: Individual Self-Policing………………………………………..64 \nTheme 3: Movement Toward Wellness………………………………………...66 \nSub-Theme A: Ability for Self-Reflection……………………………………..66 \nSub-Theme B: Improvement in Health………………………………………...69 \nSub-Theme C: Increased Self-Reliance………………………………………..70 \nEssential Pattern: Cultivating Self-Realization………………………………...72 \n\t iv\t\nCHAPTER                                                                                                                      Page          \n7   DISCUSSION…………………………………………………………………….74 \n               Implications for Future Research………………………………………………74 \n               Implications for Non-Binary U.S. Americans…………………………………76 \nNOTES…………………………………………………………………………………..78 \nREFERENCES…………………………………………………………………………..79 \n APPENDIX \n     A   CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS……………………………………………………83 \n     B   SURVEY QUESTIONS…………………………………………………………..85      \nC   INTERVIEW QUESTIONS………………………………………………………87 \nD   CONSENT FORM – SOCIAL BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH…………………...89 \n     E   INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD - SOCIAL BEHAVIORAL          \nAPPLICATION…………………………………………………………………...93 \n \n     F   INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD – APPROVAL \nLETTER…………………………………………………………………………..98 \n \n\t v\t\nLIST OF FIGURES \nFigure                                                                                                                             Page \n1.

Distribution of Significant Excerpts Across Category and Participant………………54\n1\t\nCHAPTER 1 \nJUSTIFICATION FOR STUDY \n \nIntroduction \nThroughout world history human cultures have experienced the phenomenon of \ngender and organized their societies around it in countless different ways. As a \ntransgender researcher in the United States, I am interested in the ways in which \nindividuals’ experiences of gender and identity interact with the gendered expectations \nand social structures of their time and place. The goal of this study is to find out more \nabout the lived experiences of individuals living in the United States who describe their \ngender identity as ‘non-binary’. Throughout this study, non-binary gender identity is \ndefined as any gender identity that is neither always/exclusively male nor \nalways/exclusively female. This definition could include (but is not limited to) people \nwho define their gender as: partially male and partially female, neither male nor female, a \nmixture of male and female, or sometimes male and sometimes female.  \nIt is important to keep in mind the difference between gender expression and \ngender identity in the pages to follow. While gender expression is “the way we show our \ngender to the world around us through such things as clothing, hairstyles, and \nmannerisms” (Baum, 2017), gender identity is “our internal experience and naming of \nour gender” (Baum 2017). Everyone has a gender expression and a gender identity, and \nfor some people these align while for others they do not always align. Most social science \nstudies about transgender people to date operate within a binary that is focused on \ntransgender women and transgender men and have been particularly concerned with the \n\t 2\t\nchallenges these two groups face as they try to integrate into U.S. culture’s two categories \nof men/males and women/females. This study is concerned with the experiences of a \nsmaller but equally important subset of the transgender community in the U.S. – those \nwho do not fit into either category of our cultural gender binary. The methodologies of \nfeminism and phenomenology will inform this study’s methods and analysis.  \nImportance of Researching Underrepresented Communities \nBy virtue of numbers alone, non-binary transgender people make up a very small \npercentage of the population. The most recent estimates of the transgender population \nplace the number of transgender U.S. Americans at around 1.39 million, or just 0.5 \npercent of the total population (Flores, et. al., 2016). This estimate includes transgender \nmen, transgender women, and people with non-binary/genderqueer, genderfluid, or \nagender identities. The largest survey of transgender U.S. Americans to date, the U.S. \nTrans Survey, found that just over 30 percent of their respondents identified as non-\nbinary – putting this group of people at an even smaller percentage of the population \n(James, et. al, 2016).  \nWe know from past research on underrepresented communities that these \nnumbers are likely low, and that it is not always safe or accessible for people to self-\nreport their identity in these large-scale studies. It is likely that these numbers will \nincrease over time, not necessarily because there will be more non-binary transgender \npeople in the U.S. than before, but because over time it will become safer and easier for \nnon-binary people to discover their identity and share it with their families and \ncommunities. Studies that present realistic, multi-dimensional, and self-authored accounts \n\t 3\t\nof non-binary experience will be crucial for developing a safe environment as well as \nmedical and legal rights for non-binary transgender people in the near future.  \nPhenomenon of Non-Binary Gender Identity \nOutside of the United States, there is a long global history of cultural recognition \nof genders other than male or female. For centuries, many cultures have recognized \npeople who were assigned male at birth but take on the dress, roles, and mannerisms of \nwomen and who do not identify as male or female. Some examples of these groups \ninclude the indigenous Muxe in Mexico, Indian/South Asian Hijras, and Pacific \nIslanders’ Leiti, Fa’afafine, and Mahu (Mirandé, 2015). \nEven today, there is a growing global recognition of people with non-binary \ngender identities. Various studies were conducted between 2013 and 2015 in the \nNetherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Israel to gain demographic information \nabout the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) population. Across \nthe studies, as little as two percent and as much as 35 percent of the thousands of LGBTQ \npeople surveyed in each sample self-identified their gender as non-binary (Richards, et. \nal., 2016). Legal recognition is advancing quickly as well, and currently eight countries \noffer some third gender category for legal identification documents or birth records for \nintersex and non-transgender people. Denmark, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, \nand New Zealand have already adopted the ‘X’ marking (as opposed to only ‘M’ and ‘F’ \noptions) for the gender/sex designation on all forms of legal identification, specifically \nfor non-binary people (Macarow, 2015).  \n It is clear that non-binary people have existed, do exist, and will continue to exist \nin public life and culture around the world, but still so few U.S. Americans have any real \n\t 4\t\nunderstanding of what it is like to indentify with and live in the world as a gender other \nthan male or female. Until non-binary people feel safe enough to speak our truth and gain \nrecognition in legal and social spaces, we will have to rely on the accounts of the few to \ngive some incite into the experiences and life worlds of the many.  \nResearcher Position \nWhen we learn to think of everything in a gendered way, it becomes nearly \nimpossible to conceive of a world without a gender binary (Hesse-Biber, 2014). \nIn Feminist Research Practice, the authors discuss tensions among feminist theorists over \nhow to theorize gender (within the context of feminist post-structuralism and a culturally \ndominant binary system of gender). Contemporary U.S. culture is catching on to the long-\nstanding idea that gender exists outside of a binary and that the categories we know are \nsocially constructed. Feminist writer Luce Irigaray suggests pursuing gender-neutral \nlanguage in order to form identities that are not bound by gender stereotypes and \nexpectations, and to see every individual as just that, but we are still a long way from \nnormalizing gender-neutral language in spaces where children learn to organize their \nsocial worlds (Irigaray & Whitford, 1996). What starts when we are young follows us \ninto our adult lives. For example, the structure of academic writing is still very much \nreliant on a system built from the modernist (and androcentric) values of logic, reason, \nand empirical evidence, and many academics argue that any attempt to be grammatically \ncorrect would still require using “he or she” over “they” when referring to an anonymous \nor hypothetical individual subject. \nAs a feminist researcher who was raised and socialized within these norms, I must \nbe self-reflexive and analyze my own position. But as a non-binary-identifying \n\t 5\t\ntransgender person, this means I must grapple with my longing to free myself of \ngendered expectations (based on both my female sex-assignment at birth and my male-\nappearing gender expression and masculine-of-center gender identity), while also being \naware of how my experiences with both of these social categories (and others) have \nshaped my privilege, worldview, values, and epistemology. Essentially, to be a feminist \nacademic today I must analyze how binary gender shapes and affects me, even while my \npersonal mission is to live a life outside of these categories and to take away some of \ntheir cultural value. I will further explore my worldview as a researcher in chapter 2, as I \nlay out a historical and geographical context for this study, as well as in chapter 6, where \nI will begin the presentation of this study’s findings with a statement of my own \nexperience within the phenomenon of non-binary gender identity.  \n\t 6\t\nCHAPTER 2 \nMAPPING A CENTURY OF GENDER IN THE UNITED STATES \n \n \nIn order to best understand the lived experiences of transgender people in the U.S. \ntoday, and in order to see how context affects this study, we must first examine how our \nnational conversation about gender has evolved to its current state. To accomplish this, I \nwill attempt to trace the genealogy of discourse surrounding transgender Americans over \nthe past 100 years. I of course cannot claim the following account to be complete or \nexhaustive in any way. I will instead highlight only some key moments and major shifts \nin how U.S. culture evolved in its conception of gender. It is also crucial to note that both \nthe scientific and academic conversations on gender have been historically steeped in \nwhite/male/upper-class privilege and therefore leave out many voices. Nonetheless these \nvoices are still significant for the role they played in shaping our current moment for \ntransgender U.S. Americans.  \nHere I will attempt to answer the questions: How have U.S. Americans changed \nour national conception of gender identity over the past century? And: What might this \ngenealogy tell us about the future of gender in the U.S.? A quick disclaimer: in the pages \nto follow, when I am describing what happened during each decade, I use the terms that \nwere popular at those times, even if some may seem dated or offensive today. Similarly, \nthe terms I am using today to describe the current landscape will likely be outdated at a \nfuture reading. In fact, I hope they will be; as this would be an indicator of cultural \nevolution.  \nLate 1910s to 1920s: Going Back One Hundred Years \n\t 7\t\nOne hundred years ago, the United States was experiencing the end of World War \nI and with it the beginnings of a great depression, heightened nationalism, and a fear of \ncommunist ideas. This wasn’t exactly a fertile incubator for queer ideology - after all, \nmedical and psychiatric professionals at this time thought of sex as a person’s \nbiologically innate and immutable distinction as either male or female, and they thought \nhomosexuality was a mental disorder in need of a cure. Sigmund Freud’s ideas were \ngaining in popularity and the Americans we might today label as LGBTQ were then \nliving in fear of the price of discovery - public shaming at best and institutionalization at \nworst (Katz, 1976).  \nWe can gain some insight into what this climate was like just after the turn of the \ncentury through the story of Alan Hart. In 1917, (then Alberta) Hart became one of the \nfirst known female-born Americans to request a hysterectomy for the purpose of female-\nto-male transition. The 27-year-old medical school graduate made an argument to doctor \nJ. Allen Gilbert that she should be sterilized due to her same-sex attraction toward \nwomen. This was likely the only way that Hart could have convinced the doctor to \nperform a hysterectomy, given that same-sex attraction was pathologized at this time. \nOnce the operation was complete however, Hart moved to a new city, changed his name \nto Alan, married a woman, and lived full-time as a man from then on, moving to a new \ncity each time his birth-sex was discovered (Katz, 1976).  \nNow, it is important to note here that we cannot posthumously claim anyone to be \ntransgender or transsexual who lived before these terms were coined and popularized. \nWhat we do know is that Hart had to pathologize himself in order for a doctor to treat \n\t 8\t\nhim because at that time American medical professionals had no concept for \ndistinguishing biological sex from gender identity in diagnoses. \n \n1930s: The First Sex Reassignment Surgeries \nIn the year 1930, ethnographer Leslie Spier published an account on his study of \nthe Klamath American Indian tribe. He, as many ethnographers did at that time, observed \nthe social culture of the tribe and then compared it to the lens of white European/colonial \nnorms - finding their gender customs to be vastly different from those that he knew. In \nhis report, he observed “men and women who for reasons that remain obscure take on the \ndress and habits of the opposite sex” (Katz, 1976, p. 323). He called these tribe members \ntransvestites and ‘berdaches’ - a French slur for gay men (Katz, 1976) - and joined a \nlong, disheartening legacy of white American academics pathologizing the gender \nsystems of American Indian tribes. But even as his analysis placed judgment on the \ntribe’s social structure, it simultaneously brought further awareness of different systems \nof gender to academics in the U.S.  \n Three years after Spier’s ethnography was published, Lili Elbe’s private journal \nwas translated from Danish into English and released in the U.S. - exposing American \naudiences to her story. A transgender woman, Elbe was one of the first known recipients \nof sex-reassignment surgery, which was attempted in 1931 in Germany and ultimately led \nto her death from surgical complications. Lili’s story has since been popularized by the \n2015 film The Danish Girl, but at the time her surgeon Magnus Hirschfeld captivated the \nwestern world by performing the groundbreaking and controversial procedures that could \n‘change a person’s sex’ (Beemyn, 2014; Erickson Schroth; 2014).  \n\t 9\t\n Michael Dillon was similarly pioneering as the first known transgender man to \nseek sex reassignment procedures. In 1939 in England, Dillon’s doctor began treating \nhim with testosterone to lessen menstrual bleeding. Dillon found that this treatment \nmasculinized his body, making it possible for him to pass as a man - something he had \ndesired all his life. A few years later he sought out a plastic surgeon who performed a \nsuccessful mastectomy and helped him to legally change his name to Michael. In 1946, \nHarold Gillies - a doctor who reconstructed penises for wounded soldiers and intersex \npeople - performed Dillon’s phalloplasty, which consisted of 12 separate procedures \n(Erickson-Schroth, 2014; Kennedy, 2007). Hirschfeld’s and Gillies’ work inspired \nimportant medical experiments in the U.S. which led to greater understandings of the \nhormonal differences between natal males and females (Katz, 1976).  \n1940s: The Birth of the ‘Transsexual’ \n By the 1940s, the U.S.’s gender roles were in flux as women were consigned back \nto their homes after working in the production lines and factories during World War II. \nAfter proving that there was no such thing as ‘women’s work’ or ‘men’s work’, gender \ndynamics in the post-war era started on a trajectory that would soon grow into the \nfeminist movement through a greater understanding that biological sex was not a \nuniversal determinant of one’s role in society, but that it greatly mattered in one’s access \nto opportunities (Erickson-Schroth, 2014).  \n An even more explicit turning point of gender evolution in the post-war era was \nwhen American sexologist David Cauldwell first coined the term ‘transsexual’ in 1949. \nHe defined transsexuals as those who “feel they belong to the other sex, (and who) want \nto be and function as members of the opposite sex, not only to appear as such” - a \n\t 10\t\ndefinition that closely resembles the one we use today (Beemyn, 2014, p. 507). This \ndistinguished transsexual people as different from transvestites and homosexuals (the \nthen-popular terms for those who cross-dressed and those who had same-sex attractions \nrespectively) for the first time. It should be noted however that Cauldwell, even as he \ncoined this phrase and seemed to understand transsexual people, was not sympathetic to \nthose who wanted to transition. He “believed that transsexuals were mentally ill and saw \ngender-affirming surgeries as mutilation and criminal action” (Beemyn, 2014, p. 507). \nHis views give us a very clear picture of the social stigma and binary framework that \nwere firmly attaching themselves to views of transgender identity at this time, and that \nwould prove difficult to detach in the decades to come.  \n1950s: Early Distinctions Between Gender and Sex \nThe 50s brought transgender Americans into the media spotlight for the first time \nwhen a WWII Army veteran named George Jorgensen left the United States for Denmark \nand returned as Christine in 1952. When news of Christine Jorgensen’s sex-change \nsurgery (as it was popularly called then) hit the press, the headlines read ‘Ex-GI Becomes \nBlonde Beauty’. Against her wishes she became an international spectacle and in her \nautobiography she derides the press for placing her story on the front page instead of \nimportant international news like coverage of the Korean War and Queen Elizabeth II’s \ncoronation (Beemyn, 2014, p. 508). Her visibility led her to become an early \nspokesperson for transgender people and many in the community have since written \nabout how important her visibility was to them at that time (Erickson-Schroth, 2014). \nJorgensen’s visibility was even more interesting given her own personal views about \ngender. She said once in an interview: “You seem to assume that every person is either a \n\t 11\t\nman or a woman... (when) each person is actually both in varying degrees” (Meyerowitz, \n1980, p. 98). She was known to make the point often that she was more female than male \nbut that she, like all people, had male and female within her. This early look at the \nnuance of gender identity was visionary, and a point that she does not get credit for often \nenough.  \n During the time that Christine Jorgensen was the height of public fascination, \nJohn Money published his essay An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts. In it he \noutlined six dimensions of sex: assigned sex, external genital morphology, internal \nreproductive structures, hormonal/secondary sex characteristics, gonadal sex, and \nchromosomal sex (Money, 1955). This nuanced model of biological sex argued that there \nwere more variables to a person’s sexed body than the simple male/female dichotomy \ndenotes. This research was seen by some as a stepping-stone toward greater medical \nrecognition of intersex people at that time (even though Money went on to perform \nhugely unethical ‘corrective’ surgeries on intersex babies in an attempt to normalize \nthem). Beyond the six dimensions, Money outlined a seventh dimension that is perhaps \neven more significant than all the rest combined. The 7th dimension he added to the list \nwas: gender role and orientation as either male or female (Money, 1955).  \nThis was incredibly important because it was one of the first recognitions that a \nperson’s internally felt sense of gender is a component all people posses in early \ndevelopment and is something distinct from their anatomical sex characteristics. Money \nsaw a person’s gender role as encompassing the behaviors, interests, and self reported \nidentification a person had with the masculine or feminine (Money 1955). But it cannot \nbe ignored that this breakthrough distinction of ‘gender role’ was still considered to be an \n\t 12\t\nextension of a person’s biological sex and was expected to match the other sex \ncharacteristics as male or female in ‘healthy’ people.  \n1960s: Organizing Around Shared Identity \nConceptions of trans identity majorly evolved when Robert Stoller coined the \nterm Gender Identity in his 1968 essay Sex and Gender. Stoller defined gender identity as \na person’s core sense of being male or female that develops separately from their social \nrearing and is concretely determined by adolescence. In his words, gender identity is a \n“force at work that (is) powerful enough to contradict (one’s) anatomy and environment” \n(Stoller, 1968, p. 73). He was forward thinking enough to recognize that male \ntransvestites had a different gender identity than transsexual women, but his analysis of \ngender identity does not entirely hold up today.  \nFor instance, Stoller believed that gender identity develops based on the level of \nattachment a child makes with their1 mother or father in infancy, citing the popular \nFreudian/Oedipal constructs of the day. He admitted that transsexual women could not be \nchanged to identify as male once they reached adulthood, but he recommended that \ndoctors should try to diagnose children before adolescence so their transsexualism could \nbe ‘treated and reversed’ (Stoller, 1968). Stoller makes it quite clear that transsexual \npeople were still very much pathologized by the medical professions at this time.  \nAnother advance in terminology came in the introduction of the word \n‘transgenderism’ by psychiatrist John F. Olivan. In the 1965 Sexual Hygiene and \nPathology, Olivan defines ‘transgenderism’ as something found in people who have a \nstrong urge to change their sex (Olivan, 1965). The coining of this term kick started a \ndecades-long debate of how to define various expressions within the transgender \n\t 13\t\ncommunity, including how to distinguish those who medically/hormonally change their \nbodies from those who do not.  \n In the same decade, the dynamic conversation about gender moved from clinics \nand labs out into the streets in bold new ways. Racial tensions came to a head during the \n60s and the (largely white) second wave feminist movement took root and faced criticism \nfrom black and Chicana feminists who were also working toward more equality and less \ndiscrimination for women, but were doing so across intersections of race and class. It was \nduring this time that groups of gay men, transgender women, and drag queens made \nhistory for pushing back against the years of state-sanctioned police brutality they were \nfacing on a regular basis. In 1969, their protests finally came to a head in the historic riots \nat Compton’s Cafeteria and the Stonewall Inn. These political protests, initiated by drag \nqueens and transgender women of color, drove gay activists to organize on a national \nscale and began a new era of visibility for gay and transgender people asserting their right \nto dignity and life (Erickson-Schroth, 2014; Stryker, 2008).  \nSpeaking of visibility, it must be noted that this was still a time where the most \nvisible and organized of LGBTQ people in the U.S. were white cisgender gay men, white \ncisgender lesbians, and white transgender women (usually in that order). Transgender \nstudies scholar Susan Stryker perfectly explains the reason for this:  \nIt is often the most privileged elements of a population affected by a particular \ncivil injustice or social oppression who have the opportunity to organize first. In \norganizing around the one thing that interferes with or complicates their privilege, \ntheir organizations tend to reproduce that very privilege (Stryker, 2008, p. 55).  \n\t 14\t\nWe still see much of these dynamics today in the national structure of LGBTQ rights \norganizations. Their funding streams, leadership structures, and legal agendas often serve \nthe interests of the most privileged among us first, and the needs of those who are most \nmarginalized are met only if and when it is convenient for those at the top.  \n1970s: The Social Construction of Gender \n By the 1970s, the academic and medical study of transgender people was \nbecoming more and more common. Transgender Americans were beginning to share their \nstories through memoirs and autobiographies - Jan Morris, Canary Conn, and Mario \nMartino penned some of the most well known examples (Erickson-Schroth, 2014). This \ngave the American public it’s first chance to learn about transgender identity through the \nstories of transgender people themselves. It gave the transgender authors a way to express \ntheir own views of gender’s oppressive forces, and to portray their lives as multi-\ndimensional, relatable, and healthy. \nBecause of medical advances and increased access, post-op transsexual people \nwere beginning to be recognized legally and socially as the gender that matched their \nidentity, and trans woman Renee Richards’ entry into the women’s U.S. Open was a \nlandmark example. This was also a decade packed with political actions for women’s \nrights in the form of national marches, court decisions like Roe v. Wade and Title IX, and \nthe formation of groups like the National Black Feminist Organization and the National \nWomen’s Studies Association (Beemyn, 2014; Stryker, 2008). \n Academics were beginning to frame gender as a social construct at this time. In \nThe Traffic in Women: Notes on the Political Economy of Sex, Gayle Rubin points to the \n‘sex/gender system’ (which is responsible for prescribing different roles to males and \n\t 15\t\nfemales and turning them into ‘men’ and ‘women’) as the reason that women are \noppressed in society. This is important because she is not blaming women’s oppression \non biological differences between males and females, but rather on the socially imposed \nnorms based on those perceived differences (Rubin, 1975). Conceptualizing norms about \nsex as something separate from sex - that is, gender - was still a new idea and it opened \nup endless possibilities for feminist scholars in the years to come.  \nIn Gender: An Ethnomethodological Approach, Kessler & McKenna argued that \nthe very first assumption we make about a person is whether they are male or female, but \nthat this attribution is based on a false dichotomy of two stable categories. They go on to \nargue that there is no one characteristic or behavior that we can always attribute to just \none sex without exception and that one’s gender identity is separate from the gender \nothers attribute to them based on their biological sex. Because of this, they make the \nclaim that the gender we attribute to others is always based on social categorizations and \nnorms, and is never enough on its own to determine someone’s gender identity (Kessler \n& McKenna, 1978).  \n1980s: Conflict From Within the Cause \n Given the growing understanding of gender identity and visibility of transgender \npeople, it seems almost surprising that it was not until 1980 that transgender people were \nfirst recognized in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In the DSM’s third edition, a ‘Gender Identity \nDisorder’ was listed as “an incongruence between anatomic sex and gender identity” \ncharacterized by a “sense of discomfort and inappropriateness about one’s anatomical \nsex” and a “wish to be rid of one’s own genitals and to live as a member of the other sex” \n\t 16\t\n(American Psychiatric Association, 1980, p. 261-264). These narrow diagnostic \nrequirements reflect the limited understanding of transgender identity people had at this \ntime. Transgender people today show a vast diversity of relationships to their bodies and \nare not nearly as pathologized by most medical associations as when the DSM named \n‘gender identity disorder’ for the first time.   \n1987 is considered by many to be the birth year of the field of transgender studies, \nlargely because of a transgender woman named Sandy Stone. In that year, Stone wrote an \nessay called The Empire Strikes Back: A Post-Transsexual Manifesto in response to \nJanice Raymond’s 1979 book The Transsexual Empire. In her book, Raymond blames \ntransgender women for ‘raping’ and ‘appropriating’ women’s bodies, reinforcing gender \nstereotypes that harm women, and invading/colonizing women’s safe spaces (Erickson-\nSchroth, 2014). Sadly these opinions of transgender women were not at all uncommon - \nespecially in lesbian and feminist circles.  \nStone, a white lesbian feminist transgender woman, responded to this attack on \nher identity by arguing that the reason some transgender women are adhering to ultra-\nfeminine stereotypes is not because they are appropriating or ‘dressing up’ but because \nthey are still beholden to the medical diagnostic criteria (largely based on performance of \nexpected gender roles) that will get them the treatment they need. She also points out that \nthe biggest issue in the debate about transgender people is the absence of their voices in \nany conversation and she attributes this silencing to the social pressure transgender \npeople face to blend in with cisgender society and to pass 100 percent as their \ntrue/internally felt gender after coming out. Stone claims that the only solution to this \n\t 17\t\nerasure is for transgender people to come out and be visible, especially after they \ntransition and pass (Stryker, 2008).  \nStone’s call to action may be representing some of that aforementioned privilege \nwithin LGBTQ identity. To ask transgender people to come out as openly transgender \nafter they have transitioned is to assume both that they pass/are not getting ‘clocked’ (and \ntherefore need to disclose their transgender identity), and that they are in a safe \neconomic/social position to face potential consequences of speaking openly about their \ntransgender identity. That said, Stone’s defense of transgender women is an important \ncritique of the all too real policing that happens within the LGBTQ community and the \nnormalizing lies transgender people have to tell to this day just to gain access to \ntransition-related medical care.  \n1990s: Breaking Down Gender \n The 90s saw the emergence of queer studies and trans scholarship. Judith Butler \nintroduced her groundbreaking theory of Gender Performativity in Gender Trouble, \nwhere she argues that defining ‘woman’ as a category assumes a universal subjectivity \nthat is really only true for the women of privileged, white, patriarchal influence. Butler \ntakes the idea of Rubin’s sex/gender system a step further by arguing that sex cannot be \nsignified without imposing our social system of gender, and therefore both gender and \nsex are socially constructed categories (Butler, 1990). This brings a new layer of nuance \nto idea that gender is the socially constructed sibling of sex because we cannot know one \nwithout the other, even as we try to prove their distinction. The question ‘what is a \nwoman?’ is one still asked by gender studies and feminist scholars today.  \n\t 18\t\n Definitions of transgender also broadened during this time when Holly Boswell \nre-defined ‘Transgender’ as including “all individuals whose gender identity or \nexpression differed from the gender assigned to them at birth” (Erickson-Schroth, 2014, \np. 523) - this ultimately helped to inform our current definitions of transgender (which \nmay be narrower than Boswell’s depending on who you ask). In 1994 Kate Bornstein \npublished her book Gender Outlaw, which pushed the boundaries of definition even \nfurther by calling for a breakdown of the binary system of gender altogether - even with \nregards to transgender people. Bornstein is a trans scholar who was born male, \ntransitioned and presents in a feminine way, but does not call herself a woman and \ninstead identifies herself as a ‘gender-nonconforming’ person. She writes: \nThere’s a simple way to look at gender: Once upon a time, someone drew a line in \nthe sand of culture and proclaimed with great self-importance, ‘On this side, you \nare a man; on the other side, you are a woman.’ It’s time for the winds of change \nto blow that line away (Bornstein, 1994, p. 21). \nThis is significant because the transgender cultural narrative at this point in the \nU.S. was still operating very comfortably within a binary of male and female. \nTransgender people were for the most part understood as having a mismatch between \ntheir sex-at-birth and their gender identity, and they were allowed to perform their gender \nor medically change their bodies to align the two (assuming they were privileged \nenough). But the movement they made would only be deemed acceptable if they went \nfrom one side of the ‘line in the sand’ to the other, and did so in a fairly normative way. \nBornstein’s argument was a precursor to our currently emerging views of gender identity. \nWe know now that biological sex does not exist as a binary, and intersex people (to \n\t 19\t\nprovide one obvious example) show us just how broad a spectrum of bodies humans are \nborn with. So, if sex exists on a spectrum and the binary of male and female is false, why \nwould we limit gender (which has so long been our social codification of biological sex) \nto the same false binary of man/trans-man and woman/trans-woman?  \n2000s to Today: Where Are We Now? \nThe turn of the century has led us into nearly two decades of a culture that is \nactively wrestling with what it means to be transgender, what makes a woman or a man, \nhow gender relates to sexual orientation and birth-assigned sex, and what transgender \npeople’s medical and legal rights should be. These questions are no doubt influenced by \nthe postmodern era, the emergence of the Internet and social media as near-necessities in \nmost Americans’ daily lives, and the shifting racial composition of the country.  \nThis new era has produced more visibility for transgender people, including \nfamous athletes and celebrities coming out as trans, and a magnification of transgender \nvoices in public and political discourse. Barack Obama became the first president ever to \nsay the word ‘transgender’ in a national address and to appoint transgender white house \nstaff members. The DSM’s fifth edition changed the pathologizing term ‘Gender Identity \nDisorder’ to ‘Gender Dysphoria’ and redefined ‘Gender Identity’ as “a category of social \nidentity (that) refers to an individual's identification as male, female, or, occasionally, \nsome category other than male or female” (emphasis added) (American Psychiatric \nAssociation, 2013, p. 541). National Geographic Magazine published an entire issue \nabout gender diversity and asked questions about how we define gender in today’s world. \nAmerican television shows and films now feature more transgender characters and actors \n(and who represent fewer harmful/totalizing stereotypes) than ever before.  \n\t 20\t\n We have also seen a recent explosion of new terms to describe different sexual \norientations, gender identities, and gender expressions. These span from academic-\nsounding labels like ‘scoliosexual’ and ‘nuetrois’, to more playful labels like \n‘genderfuck’ and ‘hetero-flexible’. Facebook even gives users over 40 different gender \nlabels to choose from on their profiles, and allows them to choose between ‘he’, ‘she’, or \nneutral ‘they’ pronouns. Some may feel that these new terms are further bifurcating a \nculture already known for being acutely paranoid about identity politics and political \ncorrectness. However these terms can also be seen as indicators of the continued personal \nexploration and evolution of a nation that is doing what it has always done - adapting our \nlanguage and norms to fit more people’s diverse experiences into our national schema.   \nBeyond the Binary \n There are a few different ways things could go from here. The ever-expanding list \nof identity labels that young people are embracing could cause serious pushback from \nolder generations and lead them to grasp even more tightly to the idea that a person’s sex \nis immutable and binary and dictates their gender (if gender is even distinguished from \nsex at all). Another scenario could lead to a new generation of youth who grow up asking \neach new acquaintance they meet to share their gender identity and pronouns and then \naddress them accordingly. Or maybe a ‘third gender’ category will emerge so that those \nwho do not neatly fit into the boxes of male or female will be legally and socially \nrelegated to yet another box - with some label we have not invented yet. Likely we will \nsee some form of each of these scenarios in the decades to come.  \n No matter what the near future holds, we can be certain that the binary system of \ngender and the notion that biological sex determines one’s place in that system are two \n\t 21\t\nideas that will be placed under constant strain in contemporary U.S. discourse, likely until \nthey break altogether. In a telling poll conducted by Fusion on 1,000 U.S. millennials (the \ngeneration of current 18-34 year olds) in 2015, 50 percent of the respondents said that \nthey believe gender exists on a spectrum beyond simply male or female (LoGiurato, \n2015). These numbers will likely grow with every generation. \n The past century of development for the transgender community has been marked \nby slow and steady legal and medical inclusion that acts as a powerful normalizing force \nfor those who experience gender outside of our norms. After Donald Trump’s election as \npresident, 2017 saw a regression for the transgender community’s rights when Trump \nrepealed federal guidance protecting transgender students and tried to ban transgender \npeople from serving in the U.S. military (Spivak, 2017). In the first six months of 2017, \nover 100 pieces of anti-LGBT legislation were introduced across 29 U.S. states with the \nexplicit goal of restricting gay and transgender Americans’ right to access public life \n(Miller, 2017). These legislative actions reflect the fear that many U.S. Americans still \nhave about transgender identity and what it indicates about the evolution of our nation’s \nsocial norms. \nFor non-binary/genderqueer people, there is still very little legal recognition, \npartly because most states require a doctor’s diagnosis for access to hormones, name \nchanges, and updated identification. And even if someone attains these they are forced to \nidentify as male or female under the law in all but one U.S. state. A 2016 Oregon circuit \ncourt case ruled that Jamie Shupe, a non-binary Oregonian, could legally change their sex \nto ‘non-binary’ (Foden-Vencil, 2016). At this stage in our national imagination’s growth, \ntransgender people are recognized and understood more broadly than ever, but gender has \n\t 22\t\nnot yet been socially accepted in more than two categories (man/transman and \nwoman/transwoman).  \nIn the preceding pages, I’ve taken a look at how some of the basic concepts of \ngender and sex have been shaped and changed throughout the last century of U.S. history. \nI’ve even made some preliminary guesses about what could happen next. This \ninformation should act as the context for my greater project. I hope to better understand \nhow non-binary identified people in the U.S. (specifically in Arizona) experience, \nconceptualize, and describe their gender. Transgender men and women were talked about \nand researched decades before they were ever really heard in their own voices, I hope to \ngive a voice to my community in these early stages of what will very soon be a national \nconversation about non-binary people’s validity and right to exist. I am hopeful that a few \nbrave and intrepid thinkers, like some of the people mentioned in the previous pages, will \nwork to expand our understanding of the social norms that govern all of our behaviors \nand how they affect some of us more seriously than others.  \nA Way Forward \nThe through line of every lasting and justice-oriented change toward transgender \nrights has been the presence of trans voices in the conversation. Doctors did not see sex \nchange as viable until trans patients found ways to demand what they knew would be \nlifesaving procedures. Transgender people throughout the decades have told our stories, \nfound love, fought for our rights, and led our communities, actively disproving the \nstereotypes that labeled us as isolated or sick. We have constantly and patiently educated \na public that is too often more interested in voyeurism than any real understanding. We \nhave fought to push out the walls of the holding cell each of us was born into so that the \n\t 23\t\nnext person to find themself there will not feel so constrained. Until very recently, the \nonly way for a transgender person to be validated in their feelings was to meet or hear the \nstory of another transgender person. We were forced to feel like the only one until we \nmet someone whose story reflected our own - if we were so lucky.  \nToday, children can Google search or stumble upon what it means to be \ntransgender, but the information they find may be wrought with stereotypes, hateful \njudgments, and metanarratives about how to be the right kind of trans person. By sharing \nthe experiences some non-binary trans people have with gender, I hope to bring new \nperspectives and nuance to the growing discourse about trans identity so that we can \nassert our own voices and agency from the beginning of the public debate over our right \nto exist.  \n \n\t 24\t\nCHAPTER 3 \nREVIEW OF RELEVANT STUDIES \n \n \nStudies on Non-Binary Gender Identity \n \n In their 2015 review of academic studies on non-binary gender identity, Richards, \net.al. came to the conclusion that “peer reviewed literature on genderqueer and non-\nbinary identities is evidently extremely rare” (p. 98), especially in the literature from \nmedical and psychiatric fields. The authors did however find evidence of various \nstrategies of expressing gender identity that were employed by non-binary and \ngenderqueer people. For example, several studies mentioned that non-binary people \nsometimes make their gender identities more visible by expressing gender in a way that is \nnot expected (given how most people would read their sex), or by strategically mixing \ntraditionally masculine and feminine elements of gender expression (Richards et. al., \n2015; Engel 2002; Monro, 2010). This is significant because it may indicate that it is \nimportant to the non-binary people in these studies to find ways to present/express their \ngender identity to the outside world.  \nRichards, et. al. ultimately found that “there is no evidence to suggest that non-\nbinary genders are pathological” (p.99), and that “exposure to gender role stereotypes \ndiminishes confidence and interest in ‘the other gender’s fields’ (…) as well as actual \nperformance in them” (p. 99). They recommend that mental health professionals aid their \npatients in exploring gender and discourage totalizing gendered stereotypes that may \nlimit the possibilities for the patient to self-actualize their identity. Finally, they endorse \nthe benefits of psycho-social transitions (much like those made by transgender women \n\t 25\t\nand transgender men) from male to non-binary or from female to non-binary, while \nacknowledging that these transitions sometimes do not involve any type of \nsurgical/hormonal/physical changes (Richards, et. al., 2015). While this study was \ncentered on promoting healthy exploration of gender identity, it was conducted for an \naudience of mental health professionals and did not prominently feature the voices of \ntransgender people.  \n A 2017 study by a Canadian medical research team (Frohard-Dourlent, et. al.), \ncame about because of an onslaught of requests by transgender youth to add more options \n(than simply ‘male’ or ‘female’) to a national survey of student wellness the team was \nconducting. The team realized their own gaps in understanding the youth they set out to \nsurvey, and this realization led them to study non-binary transgender youth in Canada. In \ntheir definition, non-binary is more of a descriptive term than an identity label, and it is \nused as an umbrella for more specific non-binary gender identity labels. The researchers \nmake an important note about non-binary as a descriptive term: “some people dislike that \nit is a term defined by its contrary. While this is a valid criticism, we find the term non-\nbinary helpful in illuminating the dominant view of man/boy and woman/girl as both \ncomprehensive and mutually exclusive categories” (Frohard-Dourlent, p. 2, 2017). \n They found that there was a rich recent history of medical and psychological \nstudies of transgender people, but that most of them assumed a familiar model of binary \ntransition. “These narratives favor normative embodiments and smooth over the \nmultiplicity of trans experiences, thus integrating trans identities into the gender/sex \nsystem. They make little room for trans people who experience their gender as non-\nbinary or transition in a non-linear fashion” (Frohard-Dourlent, p. 3, 2017). Ultimately, \n\t 26\t\nthey conclude that health care providers and researchers have an ethical responsibility to \naccount for non-binary transgender people. Since qualitative methods have been more \nprominent in the study of non-binary identity, they urge researchers to find nuanced ways \nto account for non-binary gender in quantitative methods, as population data can be \nlifesaving for marginalized groups (Frohard-Dourlent, 2017). \nIn her doctoral dissertation in clinical psychology, Ellen Boddington conducted \nsemi-structured interviews of six non-binary identified transgender youth living in the \nUK, and analyzed them using thematic analysis. She found two primary themes that \nemerged from the data: A.) “Discovering, describing, and understanding non-binary \ngenders” (with subthemes about self-exploration, community support, and physical \nhealth), and B.) “Non-binary genders in society” (with subthemes about stigma, activism, \nand social constructions of gender) (Boddington, p. 34, 2016).  \nMuch like phenomenological analysis, the thematic analysis featured significant \nexcerpts from each theme that exemplified the participants’ meanings. Boddington found \nthat the bodily health of non-binary youth very much correlated with their level support \nfrom friends, family, or community, and that the youth interviewed were keenly aware of \nsocietal stigmas against their identity. In conclusion, Boddington calls for broader \ncommunity education about non-binary gender identity. While this study was very similar \nto a phenomenological analysis, the research questions outlined by Boddington were \nfocused on what the participants ‘say’ and ‘describe’, as opposed to what they experience \nand the meanings that my fall beneath or between their words (Boddington, 2016).  \nIn 2012 and 2013, Sweden began to introduce a gender neutral pronoun ‘hen’ (the \nSwedish equivalent to our singular ‘they’) in addition to their masculine ‘han’ and \n\t 27\t\nfeminine ‘hon’. This sparked a public debate about why a new pronoun was necessary \nand who might be requesting others to use it, and it put Swedish people who fell outside \nof  “tvåkönsnormen” (normative binary gender categories) into the center of public \ndebate (Pless, 2015). This was the context for a 2015 Swedish study focusing on the \nexperience of people with non-binary gender identity. Anna Pless’s doctoral dissertation \nwas primarily concerned with how words or labels impacted participant’s relationship to \nothers and to their own identities. Based in queer theory and Judith Butler’s gender \nperformativity, this study shed light on the experience of choosing a label or identifier for \noneself and how one’s expectations of how the label may be received by their community \naffect this choice. For example, some participants identified themselves as ‘intergender’, \nmeaning they can switch between masculine and feminine gender expression and \nbetween identifying as man, woman, and neither/a mix. They term is similar to the \nEnglish terms genderfluid and genderqueer (Pless, 2015). The study examined the direct \nfelt experience of participants, but only as it was revealed through the meanings they \nplaced on words. Because of this lens, any meanings that were non-verbal or not directly \nassociated with identity labels may have been lost in this data set. \nPhenomenological Studies About Transgender Identity \n A few studies have focused even more specifically on examining gender identity \nthrough a phenomenological lens. In her analysis of phenomenology as a method for \nstudying gender identity, Finnish scholar Johanna Oksala comes to the conclusion that \ntraditional methods of phenomenological study cannot be applied to the study of gender \nwithout some modification. She sees the feminist study of gender and the traditional \nphenomenological method of transcendental reduction to be incompatible because “to \n\t 28\t\nstart the analysis from a woman’s experience when trying to understand what a woman is \nmeans already assuming that which we seek to explain” (Oksala, 2006, p. 237). Oksala \nproposes a post-phenomenological reading which takes into account the circular nature of \nbracketing our own ontological assumptions while simultaneously examining them in \norder to understand how they inform our bracketed analysis. She argues for moving away \nfrom such a heavy reliance on the first-person perspective of the researcher and placing a \nhigher importance on the study of the social structures that have built up that perspective \n(Oksala, 2006). Most of the problems she outlines can be remedied by the added context \nthat comes from hermeneutic phenomenological analysis, as discussed further in chapter \n4. Henry Rubin’s (1998) Phenomenology as Method in Trans Studies, also examines how \nthe topic of gender and the method of phenomenology may fit together, but he focuses \nspecifically on the topic of transgender identity. Rubin argues that phenomenology offers \na beneficial framework for studying transgender identity because of its focus on subjects’ \nlived experience and bodily knowledge.  \nWhile Oksala and Rubin’s works focus more on methodological analysis, one \nstudy by Barb J. Burdge (2013) focuses specifically on the phenomenological analysis of \ntransgender subjects. The object of Burdge’s phenomenological analysis was \n“transgenderism as a valued life experience” (Burdge, 2013, p. vi) and she used \nhermeneutic phenomenology as the method for analysis. The essential pattern found in \nthis study of 15 transgender people was ‘intimate connection’. The essential themes \nfound were A.) Intimate connection with self (with subthemes of being true, being a \nunique whole, and being strong), B.) Intimate connection with others (with subthemes of \nbeing free, being open to others, being socially competent, being helpful to others, and \n\t 29\t\nbeing in stronger relationships), and C.) Intimate connection with a larger purpose (with \nsubthemes of being spiritually enriched and being part of social change) (Burdge, 2013). \nBurdge’s study may be the most similar study to this one that I could find, but the \nlargest differences lie in the object of analysis and the sample demographic. The object of \nanalysis in this study, ‘transgenderism as a valued life experience’, already puts a \nconstraint on the participants’ description of their experience of gender identity. In asking \nparticipants to describe their experience of valuing transgender identity, they may feel \nthat they cannot or should not talk about any part of their experience of gender that is not \npositively valued. Burdge even mentions that one participant did not originally think that \nthey could participate in the study because they did not immediately categorize their \ntransgender identity as a positive experience (Burdge, 2013).  \nThe sample for Burdge’s study also sets it apart from this one in that, of her \nstudy’s 15 participants, only three identified as a non-binary gender (one as genderfluid, \none as genderqueer, and one as bi-gender). The rest identified as male-to-female or \nfemale-to-male transgender people and/or as cross dressers. So while there are some non-\nbinary voices present in this study, they have been identified on the basis of speaking \nonly to their experience of valuing their transgender identity.  \nIn Gayle Salamon’s (2010) book Assuming a Body, she argues, like Henry Rubin, \nthat phenomenological analysis can be a useful method for the study of transgender \nexperience. Salamon’s reading, intertwined with queer theory and feminist epistemology, \nsets clear distinctions between a person’s gender identity and their sexual orientation, but \nputs the two into conversation throughout her discussion because, she argues, they are so \nco-constitutive. However, the discussion throughout her book tends to be more focused \n\t 30\t\non sexual expression and romantic/bodily desire than one’s own relationship to their \ngender identity, even considering that the two can be difficult to neatly separate. Salamon \npoints out the important conflict that has emerged in the paradox of feminism’s claim that \ngender is socially constructed and transgender peoples’ claim that gender, via body \ndysphoria, can be internally and personally felt through one’s body alone. The roles that \none’s body, social environment, and identity play in determining their experience of \ngender have been a point of contention between and among transgender studies and \nfeminist scholars for years (Salamon, 2010).  \nSalamon’s discussion reflects a larger debate that will grow in years to come as \nthe categories of sex and gender continue to be stretched to their breaking point. If gender \ncategories as we have known them are based on one’s sex, then how do non-binary \ngender identities (in their infinite number) relate to a sexed body and how does one’s \nsexed body influence their discovery of a non-binary gender identity? How will feminism \nhave to change to recognize that the injustices people face on the basis of sex and gender \nexist within a hierarchy that moves far beyond simply male and female?  \nSignificance of the Phenomenological Study of Non-Binary Identity \nThese studies, and the discussions and questions that come from them, are \nimportant to consider when asking transgender people to share their experience of gender \nidentity. Phenomenology asks us to value and examine knowledge as it presents itself \nthrough our reflections on our direct experience, and this requires a delicate balance \nbetween one’s emotions, psychological attitudes, bodily feelings, sexual desires, \nsubconscious/innate knowledge, and so much more. While many scholars have identified \nthat phenomenological methods and transgender studies have great potential to inform \n\t 31\t\neach other, and while some scholars have even used phenomenological methods to study \nthe experience of transgender people, no study has been conducted to explore the \nphenomenon of non-binary gender identity through the analysis of non-binary people’s \nown descriptions.  \nThis study seeks to work through some of the challenges that exist between \nfeminist social constructions of gender and the transgender community’s necessary \nknowledge of gender as situated in the body and society, between phenomenology’s \nsearch for existential essence and the transgender community’s movement away from \nessential identity categories.  Lastly, this study was designed with the goal of giving \nagency and direct authorship to non-binary transgender people, as part of a scholarly \neffort to balance centuries of research during which many cisgender authors wrote about \nand for the transgender community through the lens of a binary construction of gender. \n\t 32\t\nCHAPTER 4 \nMETHODOLOGY \n \n \nChoosing Phenomenology \n \nThe research question for this study is: What are the lived experiences of \nArizonans who identify their gender identities as ‘non-binary’? (‘non-binary’ defined \nhere as anyone who identifies their gender as something other than ‘always and \nexclusively male or always and exclusively female’). In seeking to answer this question, I \nwill conduct semi-structured phenomenological interviews with non-binary transgender \nArizonans to record and analyze their self-descriptions of their experience with gender. \nThis means I must practice a feminist mode of “deep listening that takes tremendous \neffort and requires a willingness to be altered by the words spoken” (Keating, 2009, p. \n92), as well as a feminist orientation toward self-reflexivity from my position as a non-\nbinary researcher. \nI first encountered phenomenology when reading about various qualitative \nmethods in the eighth chapter of The Essential Guide to Doing your Research Project \n(O’Leary, 2014). This guide described phenomenology as the study of the lived \nexperience of an object, rather than the object itself (the word object is used here in the \nmore abstract form, as in ‘object of study’), based on the epistemological claim that “in a \nsocially constructed world, our direct awareness is the only thing we can really know, \nsince all knowing depends on individual perceptions” (p. 138). Upon further reading I \nfound intersections between phenomenology and transgender studies, as discussed in \nchapter 3, and this in turn shaped my epistemology as a feminist trans researcher. \n\t 33\t\nPhenomenology has become a useful tool for trans studies scholars because of its \nemphasis on lived/felt reality over biology/morphology and because of its focus on \nexperiential over discursive categorizations of identity. Henry Rubin made the first clear \ncase for pairing phenomenology and trans studies in 1998. His goal was to get “out of \nsome sticky impasses in feminist and queer studies where the brazen critiques or \nappropriations of transsexual practices are a result of the rejection of transsexual \nsubjectivity as a source of legitimate knowledge” (p. 268). \nWhile I cannot dispute that trans subjectivity has been undervalued or flat-out \nignored in much of the lifespan of feminist research, it is also true that feminist practice \ncannot be separated from the work of trans studies and can inform the methodology for \nthis project in positive ways. I must recognize the simultaneous truths that feminism has \nboth failed the transgender community in many ways and has constantly been shaped by \ntrans voices to keep pace with public discourse (of which trans people are a large focus \ntoday). It is for these reasons that I will rely on some of the tenets of feminist research to \nguide my phenomenological project.  \nFeminist Epistemology \nFeminisms share with trans studies the primary goal of placing “gender as the \ncategorical center of inquiry and research” (Hesse-Biber, 2014, p. 2). While the \ntraditional goal of feminist knowledge production was to center the voices and \nexperiences of (cisgender) women, most feminisms are evolving to take on the project of \nprivileging the voices of all those who are oppressed by our patriarchal and hegemonic \ngender system (a category which unarguably includes transgender people). In particular, \nSandra Harding’s ‘standpoint epistemology’ seeks to do just that. Harding argues that the \n\t 34\t\nvoices of marginalized groups should be the starting point to knowledge production \nbecause they do not take for granted the shared assumptions of dominant culture. \nAccording to Harding, the perspectives of those who the dominant ideology has failed \nwill prompt more objective and critical analyses of our social ‘truth’ (Alcoff & Potter).  \nWithin the constructs of feminist theory, I take an expressedly postmodern stance. \nPostmodern feminism “argues against binarisms as the primary organizing structure of \nsociety” (Davis & Craven, 2016, p. 26) and aims to produce new ways to think beyond \nthese constructs through analysis of social categories. Given that the focus of this project \nis to uncover and elevate the lived experiences of those who identify their gender as \noutside of our dominant binary construct of male/man and female/woman, postmodern \nfeminism’s frame of rejecting ideological binaries is a practical necessity for this work.  \nPhenomenology as Method \n Phenomenology is rooted in the existential and hermeneutic philosophies of \nEdmund Husserl, Martin Hiedegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jean-Paul Sartre, and \nSimone de Beauvoir, among others (Heinamaa, 2003). As a method, Phenomenology has \ntaken many forms across disciplines and scholars, but is most often based on the \nviewpoint that the natural world is only as real to us as our conscious experience of it. \nPhenomenological research works from the assumption that we can only discover the \ntruth and meaning of an experience by reflecting on it through a systematic process that \nseeks to suspend judgment and the researcher’s positional bias. Early philosophers of \nphenomenology believed that we cannot know reality in any direct way because the only \nway we can understand our world is through our mind’s perception and memory of it, \n\t 35\t\nwhich is always somehow affected by our real time corrections/theorizations/ \nrationalizations of these memories (Heinamaa, 2003; Sokolowski, 2008).  \nRobert Sokolowski describes the unique problem of phenomenological analysis in \nthis way:  \n“Since we live in the paradoxical condition of both having the world and yet \nbeing part of it, we know that when we die the world will go on, since we are only \na part of the world, but in another sense the world that is there for me, behind all \nthe things I know, will be extinguished when I am no longer part of it \n(Sokolowski, 2008, p. 48). \nIt is this paradox, of knowing that there is a world beyond our direct perception but only \nbeing able to interact with that world through our direct perception, that characterizes the \nchallenge inherent in phenomenological study.  \nHermeneutic Phenomenology in particular attends to this challenge (Burdge, \n2013). How do we get to the core nature of one’s experience of a phenomenon while \nrecognizing that any attempt to do so is always filtered through all of our automatic \nresponses and predisposed attitudes to that phenomenon? The goal of hermeneutic \nphenomenology “is to open up possible new understandings of the investigated \nphenomenon through tactful, thoughtful engagement with the phenomenon itself” \n(Burdge, 2013, p. 84). One way that phenomenological researchers try to achieve this \ngoal is through deep self reflection of one’s own understanding of the phenomenon.  \nBy looking to the direct experience one has of their gender, a person’s own \naccount gives them epistemic agency. By valuing the authority of each participant’s \n\t 36\t\nsubjective accounts I am promoting a feminist and emancipatory form of knowledge \nproduction in which the subject is the author of their own truth. \n \nFeminist Phenomenology as Method \n The methods used to answer my research question are based on the methodologies \nof phenomenologists and feminists. Feminist social science research often prioritizes \nqualitative data collection paired with intersectional analysis. Since traditional \nquantitative research methods are bound to the false claim that one can achieve \nobjectivity, and since postmodern feminists tend not to claim any knowledge as \nobjectively true, I find postmodern feminist goals to align best with qualitative data \nmethods. Feminist phenomenology seeks to gain insight from the explicitly subjective \nexperience of marginalized voices, with the overall project of using these descriptions to \nenact social awareness and change. Gayle Salamon claims that phenomenology helps us \nto “reinterrogate that which we think we know about gender and thus to radically open up \nthe traditional categories through which it is understood” (2014, p. 153). Salamon also \nnotes that phenomenology allows us to know the body “by what (we) feel, not simply \nwhat others see” (p. 154), in this way deeply engaging the subjective and reflexive. This \ndistinction between what we feel and what others see is one that transgender people are \nacutely aware of and spend a great deal of time reflecting on and/or compensating for.  \nAdditionally, this methodology aligns with the feminist practice of doing research \nwith (rather than on) a community. Phenomenology ensures that subjectivity is accounted \nfor and that participants are co-producers of knowledge. The focus here is on analyzing \nthe participant’s lived experience of the phenomenon in their own words and meanings \n\t 37\t\nthrough reflexive dialogue that includes an honest recognition of the interviewer’s (my) \nown understanding of the experiences discussed. This critical reflexivity on the part of \nthe researcher is key to phenomenological projects. As a self-identified non-binary trans \nperson, I have gained a personal perspective of how transgender people (especially those \nwho are feminine, non-binary, not white, poor, undocumented, or disabled) are constantly \nmarginalized and discredited within and beyond academic spaces. Through this project, I \nhope to disrupt this silencing by gathering qualitative data that lifts up the standpoint of \nnon-binary trans people, and by paying close attention to how my analysis of this \nqualitative data can further enhance their agency and power, while recognizing my own \nprivilege, motives, and biases as the researcher. \n\t 38\t\nCHAPTER 5 \nRESEARCH METHODS \n \n \n \nStudy Sample \n This study consisted of semi-structured phenomenological interviews with people \nliving in Arizona who self-identify their gender as neither ‘always and exclusively male’ \nnor ‘always and exclusively female’. I used the term non-binary in the title of this study \nand in recruitment materials, and all five participants listed this term as one they use to \ndescribe their gender identity. This was a small sample because of the nature of \nphenomenological research and because the identified target population is already very \nsmall. One fairly helpful estimate of the population size comes from the 2015 U.S. Trans \nSurvey (the largest survey of transgender Americans to date), which found that over one \nthird of the survey’s 27,715 respondents self-identified as “non-binary or genderqueer” \n(James, et. al., 2016). The most recently published population estimate of transgender \npeople in Arizona is 30,550 people (Flores, et. al., 2016). If 30 percent of that number \nwere also non-binary, we would be looking at around 9,100 non-binary Arizonans - just \n0.1 percent of the state’s total population.  \n Due to time and travel constraints, I scheduled in-person interviews with four \nnon-binary identified people living in Arizona. It was difficult to find and contact people \nwho openly identify as non-binary and who were willing to talk about their gender in a \nresearch setting. I made public calls for participants on social media groups exclusively \nfor non-binary people. Therefore, I cannot ensure that this sample is representative of all \nnon-binary Arizonans but as stated above this is not my goal. Rather I hope that it will \n\t 39\t\ngive insight into the ways that some non-binary trans people in the U.S. experience and \ndescribe non-binary gender identity, and how their experiences can inform our greater \nnational construction of gender. To try and ensure more diversity in my sample, I posted \nthe call for participants in various non-binary online groups, including those with \nadditional criteria for membership (i.e. groups for non-binary people of color, trans-\nmasculine or trans-feminine non-binary people, people who are non-binary & pre-op or \npost-op, non-binary older adults, etc.), however all four participants were between the \nages of 30 and 40, and self identified as white/Caucasian.  \nData Collection \n The two primary methods used for data collection in this study were qualitative \nsurveys and in-person semi-structured interviews. The two complemented each other by \ngiving opportunities for participants to author their own categories for identification \n(such as race, gender, and pseudonym) and to explain in depth the meaning of these \ncategorizations. The content of each survey and interview provided the raw data \nnecessary for this phenomenological analysis. As stated above, the choice of using \nprimarily qualitative data is one that aligns with feminist/phenomenological goals \nbecause it stands apart from positivist research traditions. By leaving survey and \ninterview questions open-ended, there were no additional constraints put on the \nparticipant by the structure of the questions (see survey and interview questions in \nAppendix). \nPreliminary Surveys \nIn order to get some basic data that can be compared across the entire sample, \neach participant took a survey online before conducting their interviews. This allowed me \n\t 40\t\nto begin the data collection with a good idea of the participant’s self-described \ndemographic information and told me how they identify or do not identify with various \ngender identity labels. The surveys were administered through a password-protected \naccount. \nThe surveys were administered only after each participant had signed an informed \nconsent statement that told participants the following: (1) the survey will be kept online \nthrough a password-protected account until all participants have filled out the survey. \nAfter all participants have completed the survey, I will print the results to be stored in a \nlocked cabinet throughout the remainder of the project and I will delete the online survey. \n(2) I will dis-identify their information by asking them to provide a pseudonym (and \npronouns) of their choice at the start of the survey that will be used for the remainder of \nthe study (including their interviews and the final analysis/write-up). (3) I will ask them \nto provide an email address in the survey so that they can schedule an interview. (4) All \nportions of the project are optional and voluntary, as are all survey/interview questions. \n(5) Their 45 minute in-person interview will be video recorded to aid in final analysis (6) \nWhen the study is complete all survey responses, recordings, transcripts, and contact \ninformation will be destroyed. \nHesse-Biber’s Feminist Research Practice states that in surveys, “participants \nshould be able to describe their experiences as they perceive them, not through the \nresearcher’s pre-conceived notions of what their worlds are like” (Hesse-Biber, 2014, p. \n303). Reading this spurred an unexpected turning point in my epistemic process as I \nrealized that the survey questions I had originally drafted for participants had a multiple \nchoice format and asks some questions that only served my own agenda and curiosity as \n\t 41\t\na trans-masculine, non-binary identified person. I was not stepping back to analyze my \nsubconscious ideas about what it means to make my community visible, and I had to \nreexamine my privileged position as the survey administrator before diving back into the \nproject.  \nOne article that gave me additional clarity during this moment was Boxes of Our \nOwn Creation by Harrison-Quintana, Grant, & Rivera (2015). Two of the article’s \nauthors were on the planning team for the National Transgender Discrimination Survey \n(NTDS) in 2011 - the first iteration of the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey. When deciding on the \nstructure of the NTDS, the authors looked to Audre Lorde’s distinction between labels  - \nwhich “someone else imposes on us from the outside” - and identities - which “we claim \nfor ourselves” (Harrison-Quintana, et. al., p. 166). My survey questions mirrored this \nsentiment by promoting self-authored identity terms wherever possible. \nUpon consulting these sources, I realized that for my study, the survey would \nneed to feature questions structured in a way that gives the participant the most freedom \nto answer truthfully and to self-identify; such as short answer questions and multiple \nchoice questions with write-in options. Some of the questions were used to gather basic \ndemographic data that became useful in describing the sample and giving context to any \ndemographic identifiers participants brought up in their interviews (for example if they \nstate their race or age as a factor in some description of an experience). The final list of \nquestions included inquiries about age, race, gender identity, and sex-assigned-at-birth, \nand about self-identifiers like the terms they use to describe their gender and the \npronoun(s) they use. I compared all survey respondents’ answers to see how the sample \nat large represents itself. This aligns with my goal of producing a deeper understanding of \n\t 42\t\nthe phenomena of non-binary gender identity that participants experience in their daily \nlives, but is not intended to become generalizable, quantifiable, or representative data \nabout all non-binary Arizonans - as this would be an unrealistic scope for my study.  \nPhenomenological Semi-Structured Interviews \nAs the participants completed their interviews, I wrote a much shorter description \nof my own experience of the phenomenon of non-binary gender identity in an effort to \nbring my own subjectivity into conversation with the data I gather. This gave me a sense \nfor how I see the phenomena I am studying and informed my own relationship to the data \nI am analyzing by helping me to be aware of how my own knowledge affects the \nanalysis. Researchers in phenomenology should include their own position in this way \nbecause we inevitably experience things differently from our participants. The goal here \nis to understand our perceptions and ‘bracket’ them (or set them aside while remaining \naware of them) during the process of analyzing others’ descriptions. \nIf we fail to examine those differences and allow ourselves to remain taken within \nthe comfort and security of our ideals, then we will never be able to reflect on the \nconcrete and immediate terms and conditions that have made our experiencing \npossible. (Martinez, 2011, p. 124) \nAs was the case with the initial survey, participant interviews began with an \ninformed consent statement explaining to participants that all questions are optional to \nanswer, that they will be recorded, that only their chosen pseudonym and pronouns will \nbe used, that the transcripts will be printed and stored in a locked cabinet, and that the \ntranscripts and recordings will be destroyed at the end of the study. I also told participants \nthat they will see the final research report (my written thesis) before I present it to my \n\t 43\t\ncommittee and with ample time to clarify any parts of the narrative description of their \ninterviews that might misrepresent the intent or meaning of their descriptions. I chose to \nconduct one 45 minute interview per participant (as opposed to multiple shorter \ninterviews) because “once an interview is conducted, the interview experience itself will \nhave inevitably influenced how the participant interprets (their) experience” (Burdge, \n2013). \nMy interview structure focused on “uncovering the subjugated knowledge” \n(Hesse-Biber, 2014, p. 184) behind participants’ experiences through semi-structured \ninterview questions that minimize my control as the researcher. I asked open, \nphenomenological questions about each participant’s experience of their gender identity \n(included in the appendices). I began with the question ‘Can you describe your gender \nidentity?’ followed by ‘What makes you describe it in this way?’ and ‘And how did you \ncome to identify your gender the way you do now?’. As participants answered, I tried to \nelicit deeper descriptions by asking clarifying questions like ‘Can you say more about \nthat?’, ‘Can you tell me what that felt like?’ and ‘When you say ___ what does that mean \nto you?’. My intent was to uncover (through their descriptions) the participants’ \nexperience of coming to know themselves as non-binary and which moments in their life \ninformed and created this knowledge. I only interjected when a clarifying question was \nrequired and asked about a new topic only when the participant had nothing else to add or \nhad diverted from the previous topic. Otherwise I responded with non-verbal active \nlistening to encourage deeper descriptions from the participants. \n Once I completed one in-person interview with each participant, I transcribed all \nof the interviews, read them several times each, and coded for preliminary themes, before \n\t 44\t\nwriting a narrative description of each interview. These narratives were sent to the \nparticipants so they could respond to my summary of their descriptions and/or reflect on \nthe descriptions they gave and provide any clarifications. When I sent the narrative \ndescriptions to them, I asked “Based on our initial interview and reading my description, \nis there anything you would like to change or clarify?” and “Is there anything else you \nwould like to tell me about your experience of gender as a non-binary person?” a \nquestion that was also asked at the end of every interview.  \nPhenomenological Analysis \nI used the transcriptions from the interviews, my written narratives of each, and \nthe survey answers as the raw data for analysis. With this data I began a process of \nphenomenological analysis consisting of description, reduction, and interpretation. The \ndescriptive phase was outlined above and is carried out through the process of interviews \nand narrative descriptions. The data gathered in this phase also includes answers from the \nsurvey and this data together provided me with the descriptive content for the reduction \nphase to follow.  \nThe reduction phase is for “abstracting various parts of the description(s) and \nseeking points of convergence and divergence” (Martinez, 2011, p. 103) while making \nsure to keep in mind and examine my own process of meaning making. To do this, I read \nall of the completed transcripts several times to familiarize myself with the content. Next, \nI highlighted in each interview the emphasized or recurring ideas and detailed \ndescriptions in order to make sure that the significant moments in each participant’s \naccount were identified. These significant excerpts in each interview became the raw data \nto organize into theme. These 181 excerpts were easily categorized into six initial themes \n\t 45\t\nthat came up frequently in each interview; broad themes that I determined only after \nreading each interview from start to finish several times. By coding each excerpt for \nwhich theme(s) it fit into, thematic similarities and differences among the participants’ \nexperiences began to emerge even more clearly. These categorizations were crucial in \ncreating the more specific essential themes during the next phases of analysis. At this \nphase I also employed the survey data to bring detail and context into the narratives and \ninitial themes that emerged (Martinez, 2011; Burdge, 2013).  \nThe final phase, interpretation, consisted of examining the excerpts in each initial \ntheme gathered from the reduction phase and considering them in relation to one another. \nThrough putting these initial themes into conversation, and looking for patterns among \nthem, I started to distinguish three essential themes of participants’ experience of the \nphenomena that were supported and exemplified throughout the interviews. These \n‘essential themes’ are not meant to be generalizable to all non-binary Arizonans, but they \nare meant to help explicate the meaning of participants’ experiences and what they can \ntell us about living life with a non-binary gender identity in their time and place \n(Martinez, 2011). The final essential pattern of the participant’s non-binary experience \nemerged through my analysis of these three essential themes and the sub-themes within \nthem. Once I had determined this essential theme, I read every participant’s significant \nexcerpts one final time to see if they were reflected in the essential pattern, themes, \nsubthemes, before finally presenting my written findings to each participant to make sure \nthat my analysis reflected their words and descriptions as closely as possible.  \nPotential Limitations \n\t 46\t\nOne may argue that this study is limited in its actionability. After all, whatever I \nmay learn from this study’s sample cannot be used to generalize new knowledge about all \nnon-binary people in the U.S. What’s more, due to the sampling method and barriers of \naccess to online social support groups for non-binary people, the participants could \npossible have more similar backgrounds than they would if more random sampling \ntechniques had been used. It should be said as well that participants who are eager to \ncontribute may have their own agendas that influence their interviews or may have biases \nabout how the study should present them - one of many inherent potential biases in social \nscience research methods.  \nThe interviews themselves had limitations too. Conducting in-person interviews \non a project of (relatively) small scope means that I could only interview people who live \nnear my university (i.e. who live in Arizona). This limited the sample but ensured more \nopenness and trust between participants and myself due to the face-to-face interview \nsettings.  \nFinally, the lack of generalizability as a goal in this study means that the results \nwill not be able to converse as directly with other relevant research. There was no tested \nhypothesis/foundational theory to prove or disprove, rather the conclusions emerged once \nall participants had contributed to the joint knowledge-building project. Additionally, \nsince I cannot generalize my data, the findings will be more difficult to use for the \npurpose of enacting policy change/direct improvements to the lives of trans people and \ntheir access to safety and health. While these limitations are real and must be addressed, I \nbelieve that we must research trans experience from all angles and from the diverse \n\t 47\t\nvoices of real trans people in order to achieve greater understanding of how gender \nshapes and dictates contemporary American lives.  \n \n \n\t 48\t\nCHAPTER 6 \nFINDINGS \n \nParticipant Narratives \n \nBased on the information each participant offered in their survey and interview \nanswers, I have constructed a brief narrative summary of each participant. The names of \neach are pseudonyms that participants were asked to create to identify themselves \nthroughout the study. All other names and identifiers have been removed.  \nAgrippa: \nAgrippa is a 30-year-old who uses ‘they/them’ pronouns. They are tall and thin, \nwith glasses and shoulder-length wavy blonde hair shaved on both sides. They don’t \nidentify as a man or a woman, they were assigned male at birth, and describe themself as \ntransgender, non-binary, genderfluid, gender non-conforming, and trans-femme. When I \nmet Agrippa, they were wearing gladiator-style lace-up sandals, tight-fitting pants, a \nscoop-neck tank-top, a long necklace, and red painted nails. Agrippa explained that their \ngender identity can quickly move back and forth between the masculine and feminine \nends of the gender spectrum, something that they cannot control but are very aware of. \nAs a child, Agrippa felt a strong sense of gender variance and was disappointed when \nthey did not grow breasts during puberty.  \nThey recently came out on Facebook as genderfluid and non-binary and have \nreceived strong support by their friends and community. There family is still adjusting \nand learning to use their gender pronouns. Agrippa is not out at work, but does not \ncompletely hide their gender expression in the office either, and has a supervisor who \n\t 49\t\nsupports them. Since coming out, Agrippa has felt an increased sense of ease and comfort \nin their body, and a growing love of fashion and feminine clothing. They have a \ngirlfriend of about a year who is incredibly supportive, and they have seen their \nfriendships become more genuine as they live more openly. However, Agrippa \nmentioned living with a constant awareness that there are many people who do not \nunderstand their gender identity, and they fear that they may face physical harm or some \nform of abuse when they present more openly as a genderfluid/non-binary trans person.  \nAlex: \n Alex is a 37-year-old who uses ‘she/her’ pronouns. She has short red hair and fair \nskin. Alex was assigned female at birth, but has recently come to know her gender \nidentity as mostly agender and genderfluid. She also describes herself as non-binary and \ngenderqueer. When I met Alex, she was wearing jeans, a v-neck tshirt, and a cardigan. \nAlex comes from a conservative religious background, and remembers always feeling \nthat something about her gender did not match what everyone expected of her. If Alex \ncould wave a magic wand, she would express her gender in a neutral way, or be open to \nexpressing across the spectrum, and she would even consider changing her body to some \nextent. While her pronouns are generally associated with women, she has used them her \nwhole life and feels comfortable continuing to use them, as she is not confident that the \npeople around her would ever use different pronouns if she asked.  \nAfter one of her children came out as transgender, and she began to meet more \ntransgender people, Alex started to be more open about her gender with the people in her \nlife. This experience has brought her much closer to her children, and she feels optimistic \nabout the open-mindedness of younger generations. She is no longer involved in any \n\t 50\t\nreligious community, as she and her son did not feel welcome or supported. She feels \nsafe at work, but the nature of her job would make it difficult for her to change her \ngender expression noticeably from day to day. Currently, Alex does not have a supportive \nenvironment for non-binary gender expression at home or in her community. She says \nthat trying to reconcile how she feels with what her environment requires of her has taken \na negative toll on her emotional and physical health, but that her mental health has \nimproved as she has become sure of her identity.  \nMax: \n Max is a 32-year-old who uses ‘they/them’ pronouns. They have multiple tattoos, \nshort hair dyed shades of pink and purple and shaved on the sides and back, and a small \nseptum ring. Although they feel most comfortable with a masculine gender expression, \nMax does not identify as male or female. They describe their gender as Non-Binary, \nTrans-Masculine, Genderqueer, Transgender, and FTX. When I met Max, they were \nwearing a v-neck t-shirt and shorts. Max has been taking testosterone for about nine \nmonths, has been binding their chest for years, and will be having ‘top surgery’ (a \nbilateral mastectomy) in a few months. Max is excited about getting facial hair and a \ndeeper voice, but expressed concern about their body changing to the point where they \nwould only be seen as male, and may stop taking testosterone if they feel they are no \nlonger seen and treated as a genderqueer person.  \n Max never felt like a woman or a man, and does not believe in a binary system of \ngender. They came out as a lesbian at age nineteen but when they still struggled with \naccepting their body and expressing their gender they began to realize that they were \ntransgender. Though transitioning has given Max a better relationship to their body, they \n\t 51\t\ndesire to stay strongly tied to the feminine parts of their personality, and have struggled \nwith the emotional changes that hormone therapy has caused. They have a strong \ncommunity of very supportive friends. They experienced a high level of anxiety in their \nprevious work environment, and felt that they could not come out at work. After \ntransferring to a new branch, Max feels safe and comfortable, and has more affirming co-\nworkers. Max has noticed a transformation in their self-confidence and ability to \nadvocate for themself.  \nMegan: \n Megan is a 34-year-old who uses ‘they/them’ and ‘she/her’ pronouns. They have \nshort hair that is partially dyed green. Their expression changes from more masculine to \nmore feminine depending on how they feel, but they do not believe in the gender binary \nand describe their gender as non-binary, agender, genderqueer, and genderfuck. When I \nmet Megan, they wore a polo shirt, shorts, and sneakers with long socks, and had on \nmultiple small earrings, bracelets, and necklaces. Megan has never identified as a woman, \nbut does not feel like a man either. They recalled a feeling of betrayal when their body \nstarted to develop during puberty, and they often wear a chest-binder. They have \nconsidered getting top surgery, though they are afraid it will be unattainable because it is \nso expensive.  \nThey started to actively explore their gender identity when they got divorced from \ntheir ex-husband, who came out as gay. They accidentally attended a support group for \ntransgender women and this introduced them to their local transgender community. They \nare now content in knowing that they are not absolutely sure what form their gender may \ntake in the future. Megan started to come out at work, but faced a few hurdles when their \n\t 52\t\ncoworkers confronted them about their pronouns. Coming out has made some of their \nfriendships more distant, as their friends are unfamiliar with this part of Megan’s identity. \nMegan has recently started dating a transgender woman and this has made them realize \nhow people view trans-femininity. They worry about safety when they go out in public \ntogether, and they try to express their gender in a way that is a mix of masculine and \nfeminine so that they can distinguish the people who will be accepting from those who \nmay respond violently. Overall, Megan’s happiness and confidence has improved since \ncoming out and genuinely expressing their gender.  \nResearcher’s Experience With Non-Binary Gender Identity \n As a feminist researcher following phenomenological methods, I must exhibit a \ncertain amount of reflection upon my own position with relation to the topic at hand. I am \nin a privileged position as a researcher because the power dynamic between me and the \nparticipants of this study is such that I have the final control over how their experiences \nare represented. However, as a non-binary transgender person myself, I know the \nvulnerability and trust inherent in sharing such deep and personal accounts, and I intend \nto represent these descriptions ethically and with the respect they deserve.  \n My experience with non-binary gender identity began as I was first exploring my \nown dysphoria with my body at the age of 21 (I was assigned female at birth). I have \nalways been more comfortable in a neutral or masculine gender expression and presented \nthat way off and on for about two decades before realizing I was transgender. When I was \nfirst exploring and finding resources online, I discovered non-binary identities and knew \nintuitively that I fit somewhere within this category, but I also had a deep desire to have \nmy breasts removed and to see my body take on the masculinizing effects of testosterone \n\t 53\t\ntherapy. Now, a few years later, I have had a mastectomy and have a deeper voice, more \nmuscle mass, and some facial hair as a result of hormone replacement therapy. When I \nfirst came out as transgender I told everyone I was transitioning to male and started going \nby ‘he/him’ pronouns. At the time, I was trying on this identity as I truly thought it was a \nviable option that would make me happy. As I started to pass more and was treated as a \nman, when people close to me began to see me as a man, I realized the privilege inherent \nin this ability to hide my transgender identity, but I also remembered my early days of \nexploration and identification with non-binary people. I felt deeply what I had known \nfrom the start: that I feel just as not-fully-male as I did not-fully-female when I came out. \nI don’t desire to live in the world with a 100 percent typically male body and to be \ntreated, seen, and recognized as 100 percent male.  \nHowever, since I am equally comfortable using ‘he/him’ and ‘they/them’ \npronouns, most of the people in my life who knew me before and during my transition \nfrom female still see me as a trans man. This does not bother me so much because my \nauthentic gender expression is such that when I’m dressing and acting authentically I \nappear to people as a feminine man. More recently, I have reexamined what it means for \nme to be non-binary – something I always have been and always will be – and how this \npart of my identity is affected by my past presenting as a girl, then an openly lesbian \nwoman, then a straight trans man, and now a queer, masculine-of-center, transgender, \nnon-binary person (who still looks to most strangers like a straight cisgender man). I have \nhad to reconcile with the fact that my non-binary identity being less visible does not \nmake it any less true, but that it means it will not often be acknowledged outside of queer \nspaces. This internal recognition and affirmation of my identity as not female but not \n\t 54\t\nfully male has made me happier, healthier, and more independent than I have been at any \nother stage of my life. I know that this comes from a combination of having a body free \nof dysphoria, an authentic gender expression, and a clear internal sense of my identity as \na transmasculine, non-binary transgender person.  \nIt is important to note that I also recognize my immense privilege as someone \nwho had the time, financial security, and community support to medically (as well as \nsocially) transition. This privilege is furthered when considering that I am white, I appear \nmore masculine than feminine, I pass as male, and I am attracted to women (and \ntherefore also pass as straight). It is from this position that I conducted my analysis. \nInitial Reduction \n The four interviews led me to 181 excerpts that pointed to instances of \nsignificance (e.g. intense emotions, turning points, realizations, deep descriptions, and \nreiterated points). These significant excerpts could each be categorized into at least one of \nsix initial categories: A.) Internal Factors (i.e. one’s knowledge of their gender identity or \nrelationship to their body), B.) External Factors (i.e. one’s gender expression, clothing, or \ngender roles), C.) Prohibitive Factors (i.e. negative or painful experiences, emotions, \nmemories that hold back authenticity or wellness), D.) Affirming Factors (i.e. positive \nexperiences, emotions, memories that encourage authenticity or wellness), E.) Moments \nof Understanding (i.e. instances that promoted one’s discovery of their gender identity or \nsense of self), and F.) Moments of Labor (i.e. instances where effort was put into being \nsafe, healthy, or supported in one’s gender identity). The distribution of significant \nexcerpts across theme and participant are displayed in Table 1. Most excerpts were coded \nfor several themes. These categories organized the data in a way that made clear the \n\t 55\t\nconnections between each interview’s significant moments and informed the creation of \nthe essential themes to follow.  \n Table 1 \n Distribution of Significant Excerpts Across Category and Participant \nInitial Coding Category Agrippa Alex Max Megan \nPercentage of \nAll Significant \nExcerpts \nProhibitive Factors 13 11 13 12 27.07% \nMoments of Understanding 9 6 10 9 18.78% \nMoments of Labor 17 26 16 15 40.88% \nInternal Factors 22 11 15 12 33.14% \nExternal Factors 24 23 23 15 46.96% \nAffirming Factors 14 13 17 12 30.93% \n \nEssential Pattern and Themes \n Throughout the interviews, as each participant described their experience of \nhaving a non-binary gender identity, their unique discussions created one essential \npattern, that of Cultivating Self Realization. This leads me to conclude that for these \nparticipants the experience of non-binary gender identity is, in essence, an experience of \ncultivating self-realization. This through line is supported by three smaller essential \nthemes. Throughout their descriptions, every participant outlined turning points in the \ndevelopment of their gender identity in three categories: 1.) Internal Recognition, 2.) \nExternal Presentation, and 3.) Movement Toward Wellness.  \n Eight subcategories emerged within these three themes. Internal recognition of \none’s gender identity was characterized by: A.) Intuitive/Bodily Knowledge, B.) \n\t 56\t\nDiscovery of Possibility, and C.) Rejecting the Binary. The participants’ external \npresentation led to: A.) Change in Relationships, and B.) Individual Self-Policing. In their \nmovement toward wellness, participants experienced: A.) Ability for Self-Reflection, B.) \nImprovement in Health, and C.) Increased Self-Reliance. A graphic representation of the \nessential pattern, themes, and subthemes is offered in Figure 1 below. \nEssential Pattern: Cultivating Self-Realization \nTheme 1: \nInternal Recognition \nTheme 2: \nExternal Presentation \nTheme 3: \nMovement Toward Wellness \n \nSub-Themes: \nA.)

Essential meanings of the participants’ experience of the phenomenon of non-\nbinary gender identity.  \nTheme 1: Internal Recognition \n Participants each discussed at length the process by which they came to know \ntheir gender and describe it as they do today. This journey of discovery began with the \ninternal recognition of how they interacted with gender. Participants described how going \nthrough puberty changed their relationships with their bodies, how family life and their \nchildhood taught them gender roles and expectations, how meeting other transgender and \nqueer people helped them to understand what all of these feelings meant. Finally, they \ndescribed how they came to the realization that they felt somewhere in between or \noutside of completely male and completely female. This process of Internal Recognition \nwas comprised of moments and feelings that fell within three subcategories: A.) \nIntuitive/Bodily Knowledge, B.) Discovery of Possibility, and C.) Rejecting the Binary. \n\t 57\t\nThe following will explore these subthemes in depth, using significant excerpts from the \ninterview transcripts that led to the formation of each theme. \nSub-Theme A: Intuitive/Bodily Knowledge \n \n The participants each expressed a lifelong feeling that the gender associated with \nthe sex assigned to them at birth did not fit how they felt or who they wanted to grow up \nto be. However, none of them entirely desired to transition and live exclusively as what \nmany people would consider the ‘other gender, and thus they were left with the confusion \nof having only two options in sight and not identifying with either one. Agrippa explains \nthe lifelong weight of this feeling:  \nAll my life it was a thing that I would always have at the back of my mind and \nreflect: ‘When are you gonna deal with this? This seems to be a thing that’s not \ngoing away’… It’s been such a constant in my life. I knew from the time I was \nlike ten that this was a thing. But I was sort of in denial about it.  \n \nThat feeling was only heightened when Agrippa reached puberty and they started to \nrealize that their feelings were not typical to those of their peers. This was the beginning \nof about two decades of hiding and ignoring these feelings. \nWhen I hit the age that I noticed that puberty was a thing, people started \nchanging, I expected that I was gonna develop breasts and look like more of the \ngirls that I knew. And then I found out that that wasn’t the case. And I was kind of \ndisappointed. But I got the impression that, since it wasn’t going to happen, \npaying attention to it or talking about it wasn’t appropriate. So all of that thought \nand feeling just stayed inside and closeted.  \n \n Megan had a similar experience with puberty, however instead of finding that \nsomething was missing, they found that the breasts they were developing were foreign \nand undesirable. They longed to retain the neutral body they had grown used to: \nGoing through puberty I really felt betrayed. Just thinking about how my whole \nlife I have to be with this now. Like, there’s no going back. If I could go back to \nbeing a preteen, and just everything being neutral, that would be fantastic. But I \n\t 58\t\ncould never really express that, or at least I didn’t feel safe to talk about that \nfeeling... \nI would avoid wearing a bra because I was like: ‘I don’t even wanna admit that \nthose are there. I just wanna hunch my shoulders and pretend that they’re not \nthere’. So looking back that makes sense, but at the moment I just thought that \nthere was something wrong with me, and I just shouldn’t talk about it.  \n \nMegan’s feelings of dysphoria seemed taboo to her at the time, much like Agrippa’s. \nThey shared a sense that whatever they were feeling was wrong; that they could not reach \nout for help because they believed they were alone in the feelings they could not explain.  \nMax echoes their confusion:  \nI feel like genderqueer and gender non-conforming identity has always been a part \nof me, since I was a child. I think I lived for a really long time not being able to \ndescribe it. Like years and years… \nI have a lot of memories of being very young and wishing I was a boy, and having \nthose sort of boy inclinations. I have this stupid memory of when I was- not \nstupid, but of when I was a kid trying to adjust my pants to look like I had a penis. \n \nThese instinctive physical indicators of difference left the participants feeling as though \nthey were alone or that perhaps there was something wrong with them. However, luckily \neach of them grew into adulthood and began to encounter other people who felt the same.   \nSub-Theme B: Discovery of Possibility \n Meeting a transgender person who was living a full and healthy life was a crucial \nfactor in the participants’ self-discovery. The visibility of others before them became the \nvalidation they had been searching for to start to speak and live their truth for the first \ntime. Alex tells the story of how she came to feel this sense of empowerment, and began \nto shed her feelings of guilt and confusion despite generational gaps: \nI went back to school, and then I met a friend of mine who is male-to-female \ntransgender. And she spoke to my class and I was like: ‘Oh my God! This is \nwonderful!’… \nAll this started kind of coming up. And I guess I’m this small-town person raised \nin a very small-town way. And so I was a very old adult by the time I had the \n\t 59\t\nright way to figure out what was going on. So I tried to be really excited and tell \npeople I was close to: ‘Ok guess what. I figured it out. And I’d really like to be a \nlittle bit more like what I feel like I need to be, and less of what I feel like you \nneed me to be’. And it didn’t really work for anyone but my kids. I have to tell \nyou my kids are amazing and accepting. They’re like ‘Tell me what you need. Ok, \nwe’ll use that word’.  \n \nEven while many people in her life rejected her first attempt to come out to them, Alex \nfelt the support of her friend and her children, and this alone was enough to carry her into \na process of deeper self-exploration.  \n For Agrippa, it was the vast diversity of people online that provided that safe \nplace and a path to discovery:  \nI only really started identifying as non-binary and genderfluid when I knew that \nthere was a word for that… \nI thought I was the only one that had this experience. And then when I discovered \nthe Internet and I heard the story of a genderfluid individual who was like: ‘I go \nback and forth and sometimes I feel more femme and sometimes I feel more \nmasc, but it’s never really tied down. It could even change within a day, or within \nan hour’. So the more that I was exposed to other people’s stories… I could \nreflect on my own experience, and say ‘That’s something similar to what I’ve felt \nor noticed in myself’. \n \nMegan similarly stumbled upon an online representation of transgender identity through \naccidentally finding their way into a local transgender support group. They told me about \nthis funny coincidence: \nOddly enough, right before the lesbian meet up they had a trans meet up. And I \ngot the time wrong and I accidentally showed up for that one. And they were like: \n‘Well come on in! It’s fine!’ and I was like: ‘But you know I’m- I don’t know. I \ndon’t think I’m trans’. And it was transwomen specifically, so I really felt like I \nwas not in the right place. But hearing their stories and everything… \nI was like: ‘I’m an advocate for transgender people. I’m so interested in this topic. \nSuper interested’. So whenever I get interested I just start researching things on \nthe internet and reading and reading and becoming familiar with everything and \nthen getting into the nitty gritty, like the kind of whispers in the background. Sort \nof like: ‘Also non-binary people are under the trans umbrella’. It’s like: ‘Woah, \nwhat? And actually a lot of that sounds like me, because I’m not fitting into either \nidentity’.  \n\t 60\t\n \n Through each participant’s unique encounters with the transgender community, \nthey began to realize not only that body dysphoria was not uncommon, but also that one \ndoes not have to transition only from male-to-female or from female-to-male. This \nopening of the definitions of gender helped them to see a future for themselves where \nthey might be able to come out and transition from male or female to non-binary.  \nSub-Theme C: Rejecting the Binary \n A strong community of LGBT friends surrounded Max for many years before \nthey came out as trans. They were familiar with what hormone therapy could do for a \nperson who was born female. But when they began taking testosterone to masculine their \nbody, Max found themself caught between their desire for their body to adopt some \ntypically male features and their desire to remain visibly non-binary in a culture where \nvisual cues and assumed gender are so automatically linked.  \nI kind of went on T as an experiment. And then I was like: ‘Woah, yeah! This is \nme. This is everything I wanted’. You know? And then trying to reconcile that \nnon-binary stuff. Because I don’t feel like a man. I don’t want to be a man… \nIt’s hard because I feel so excited about the changes! It’s a duality in my head! \nBecause I am excited about hair, and I’m excited about my voice changing. My \nvoice has deepened quite a bit. Yeah I’m excited for it. So I think it’s hard \nbecause I want to be visibly queer and visibly trans, and I don’t want to. And I \ndon’t really have an answer… \nIt’s something I grapple with a lot. I just don’t wanna pass for a cis-dude at some \npoint. That feels scary to me. Because being visibly queer is so important to me. \nIt’s like my whole life. Well not my whole- but it’s been this huge part of my \nidentity. \n \nAlex, on the other hand, knew that she would need to continue to present a certain \nway in her job, community, and home life. But even though making changes to her body \nwas not something she could strongly consider, she still desired to be seen neither male \nnor female, but someone else entirely: \n\t 61\t\nI think I lean towards agender. So I don’t think I’m strongly in one \ncamp…What I express might not necessarily be what I feel, I guess. Now \nyou have me thinking. I guess I have moments of gender, and other than \nthat I would be agender. Even though that’s not what I express…  \n(If I could) I would have more flip-flopping days, or just be more neutral \nall together. I just kinda want to be neutral. Can we not say I’m anything \nin particular? \n \nHer frustration about feeling forced into being labeled as either a man or a woman was a \nsentiment expressed by every participant. Both Megan and Max specifically use the label \n‘non-binary’ to express this very idea. Megan writes: \nI feel like non-binary not only indicates to a person that I don’t fit either of the \nbinary, but they also can sometimes pick up on the fact that I don’t necessarily \nbelieve that the binary exists… I’d rather be neutral. Somewhere in the middle. \n \nMax goes a step further and explains how non-binary identity helps them to honor the \nmore masculine and the more feminine parts of their identity simultaneously:  \nI’m a masculine person that doesn’t subscribe to the gender binary. I just don’t \nfeel either male or female. I feel like I’m somewhere in between. But I’m \ndecidedly more masculine than I am feminine in my presentation…  \nEven though my body feels more in line with my mind when I’m doing these \nsorts of medical transition stuff like taking testosterone and getting top surgery… \nAlthough I do really feel close to the feminine aspects of my personality. Which \nis another part of non-binary identity for me. \n \n The participants learned about non-binary identity in varied ways, and they are in \ndifferent positions that allow some more freedom than others to medically transition or \nexpress their gender as they feel it. However, they have each come to a place where they \nfeel deeply that they do not exist with a binary structure of male and female, and that they \nmust be honest about that (even if only to themself) in order to live a more full life. These \nearly experiences and emotional journeys catalyzed their movement toward a full and \nauthentic experience of gender identity. No matter their path to understanding their \n\t 62\t\ngender, every participant has gone through life changes as they reconcile their inner sense \nof gender with their presence in the social world outside.  \nTheme 2: External Presentation \n Gender expression is something that everyone has; it does not matter if you are \ncisgender (meaning your birth sex and gender align) or transgender. Gender expression is \nhow a person conveys their gender to the outside worlds through social roles, clothing, \nmannerisms, and even subconscious visual and auditory cues. In their descriptions of \nnon-binary gender identity, the participants dove deep into discussions of gender identity, \nwhat it means to them, and how they use it to manage the way that people respond to \nthem in different areas of their lives. For some, expressing non-binary gender meant a big \nchange in how they appeared. For others, it was something subtler and harder to notice. \nFor each of the participants, this external presentation of an internally recognized gender \nidentity manifested itself in two primary ways: A.) Change in Relationships, and B.) \nIndividual Self-Policing.  \nSub-Theme A: Change in Relationships \n Although some changes were positive and others more negative, every participant \ndiscussed how their relationships to their family, co-workers, friends, and intimate \npartners changed as they became more aware and open about their gender identity. Some \neven mentioned how living into their true gender changed how they viewed others.  \nAlex shared how opening up to her husband about her gender identity changed \ntheir relationship. Her husband was only interested in recognizing Alex’s gender in their \nsexual relationships, but made her feel like she needed to hide it in every other aspect of \nlife:  \n\t 63\t\nI think it has changed how I feel in the bedroom. So that’s huge for me. I think \nthat’s almost one of the places where I feel it the most. And, you know, that’s an \nissue for me… \nI think it’s interesting because from my partner’s perspective, everything goes \nthere. It’s fine. But as soon as we’re out of the bedroom then: ‘Oh Hell no’. We’re \nnot gonna actually live that life. That’s just something we get to do sometimes’. It \ngets let out there, but that’s it. But then that causes me to repress that more than \nanything else in my life. Like no, that’s never gonna be let out there. That’s the \nlast place it’s gonna be let out. So that’s not ok. \n \nAfter experiencing various levels of acceptance in past relationships, and after breaking \nup with one partner because she was unable to see them as non-binary, Max started to \nreflect on what they needed from a partner and what they brought to the relationship. \nThey had a realization that living more genuinely changed the way they approached new \nromantic relationships:  \nIt’s a huge ‘duh’, but you don’t think about it as that; being authentic helps your \nself-esteem! And your understanding yourself in the world… \nIt’s definitely shown up in my dating life and relationships. I think that I have \nboundaries and ideas of what I want and need, and I’m pretty good at articulating \nit. So that’s felt really good \n \nAgrippa’s was excited to find that their community was strengthened when they \ncame out. They were able to bring their entire personality into social interactions and \nwere greeted with the same level of authenticity in response.  \nSo if you talk about the interpersonal relationships and the human environment \nthat I surround myself in, yeah. I would say that it’s gotten a lot better since I’ve \ncome out. Because I’m no longer questioning and editing my own actions and my \nown interactions, I feel like I have much more honest encounters with my friends. \n \nMegan, on the other hand, found that as they lived into their identity their friends began \nto distance themselves from them in subtle ways. Megan mentioned that things will likely \nnever be as they were before, but that they will still find social support somewhere. They \n\t 64\t\nexplain: “It sucks, but then again I want friends who are ok with who I am. That’s just \nhow it is”.  \n Even the singular act of requesting that people use a new gender pronoun proved \nto cause all kinds of changes in the participants’ relationships. Agrippa and Max in \nparticular shared that their families were trying to understand, but still struggled. Agrippa \ntold me:  \nThe tough thing, that my family is finally coming around on, has been pronouns. \nBut that’s tough for a lot of people. You know?...  \nMy parents were tough at first, because it was just a very new thing. And also the \ndegree to which I didn’t really know how to talk about it or instigate this feeling, \nwas light years ahead of their preparation for this. Or exposure, or interest. \nBecause for their generation that was not a thing. Their closest touchstone is \nCaitlyn Jenner, and that’s about the depth of their understanding of the \ntransgender experience. \n \nMax echoed this generational divide, although they saw yet another dynamic come into \nplay because of their parents’ evangelical Christian background: \nWith my family, I’m still kind of working on it. They understand things about me, \nbut they continue to misgender me. And I’m just giving them the time and space \nto do that…  \nI come from a very conservative background. My parents are, not that much \nanymore, but were evangelical Christians. And my mom is very gender \nessentialist. \n \nAcross the board, the people who made a positive impact on the participants were \nthose who were either already familiar with non-binary people, or who knew nothing \nabout non-binary identity but were willing to learn and respond to the new information \nwith open-mindedness and respect.  Most of the negative experiences the participants \nrecounted had to do with the other person’s lack of familiarity/comfort with non-binary \nidentity and an unwillingness (either implicit or overt) to recognize it. These negative \nreactions, and the fear of future interactions that might look the same, caused the \n\t 65\t\nparticipants to self-edit their behavior and expression to suit how they felt other people \nwanted them to be. \nSub-Theme B: Individual Self-Policing \nEvery participant reported multiple instances of having to change their behavior, \nappearance, or life decisions at some point to conform to what they thought others \nexpected of them. Most of them experienced this in relation to their work environment. \nFor example, Megan struggled when attempting to come out at new job:  \nIn my current job, they wanted us to make a bio. And we had to talk about \nourselves in the third person. And I was just starting to write a rough draft and I \nimmediately went to ‘They’, and froze. And just didn’t work on it for two more \ndays because I was like: ‘I don’t know what to do. After a few days of thinking it \nover, I decided I’m just gonna do it and see what happens…  \n \nThe upstairs office called and she was like: ‘Did you mean to say ‘they’? I have \nquestions’ and then I said: ‘Yes, that’s actually my preferred pronoun. I \nunderstand it’s a little confusing but it’s how I feel’. And she said: ‘Ok well, \nthat’s fine I’ll leave it in’. So that was pain-free and I was so excited. But then one \nof the admissions people was reviewing it and double-checking it, and she just \nchanged it to ‘she’ pronouns. And came and talked to me the next day after she \nhad realized what she had done. That she had just been ignorant and made this \ndecision without asking about it. And that was disheartening. Even though she \nwas apologetic, and said: ‘I guess we can change it back’. But I didn’t want to put \nher out, I don’t know. Like: ‘Yeah it would be great if you put it back but I don’t \nfeel comfortable asking you to put it back’. So that was really disappointing. I still \ndon’t know what I’m gonna do with that or if I’ll just leave it. \n \nThis story exemplifies the heavy feeling of knowing something might go wrong, \nexpecting for people not to understand, and having to perform according to others’ level \nof comfort/familiarity.  \nMax experienced a crisis when trying to conform in their work environment:  \n\t 66\t\nI used to have all of these rules for myself at work. Like about what I could wear \nand stuff… I wear a lot of bowties, like any other queer, but I used to have rules \nabout not wearing them at work. Even though I love dressing up… I just had \nweird rules for myself. I don’t know why. Shame does weird things to you. \n \nUltimately, this pressure to change caused a noticeable decline in Max’s physical health, \nespecially once their body started to change:   \nAt my job I knew that I needed to come out. That I was on T, that I was feeling \nvery uncomfortable to continue to be transitioning and not tell anyone. Just \nexisting as my birth-name, and at this job. So the job itself was stressful and kind \nof an unhealthy environment… \nI used to get these weird neck pains literally every time I would come into (work). \nBecause I didn’t know I had this stress. Right? So I’d be fine all weekend, and \nthen I’d walk in the first day of work and I’d have weird pains because of stress.  \n \nAlex told a different story, based on her feeling that work may be a safer place for \nauthentic expression than her home or community:  \nIn my work environment, I feel like I could change tomorrow and change \nsignificantly and I would be ok. And there are people who wouldn’t be ok with it \nbut the people that matter, that keep me employed, would be fine with it… \nI work in a very accepting environment... It’s more what I have to be when I leave \nthat restricts that. \n \n Agrippa explained that, being raised as a boy, they felt an intense social pressure \nto conform to masculinity and maleness before coming out: “I tried to go completely \nmasculine and just be a dude and all that for a few months, and it wasn’t satisfying. Or \neffective. I didn’t like who I was being or the behaviors and feelings I was exhibiting”. \nThe explained how their gender identity made them acutely aware of the implicit norms \nwe all learn as children and carry with us into adulthood. They explained: “When you \nenter into a situation and people perceive you as one gender or another, they’re expecting \nyou to perform in a certain way. If you don’t it’s weird. It turns everything on its head \nand it feels awkward.” \n\t 67\t\n \nOnce they had a deeper internal recognition of their gender identity as non-binary, \neach participant faced positive and negative responses when they began to bring their \nunderstanding of gender into conversation with their social world. The people and \nenvironments around them in turn mediated their external presentation of gender, which \ncaused changes in their relationships and controlled how and where they could fully \nexpress themselves. These experiences, though challenging and painful at times, helped \neach participant to gain a deeper understanding of themself and to make decisions that \nwill help them to move toward a life that authentically represents their gender.  \nTheme 3: Movement Toward Wellness \n During their interviews, every participant spoke from a place of knowing \nconfidently how they identify with gender and of trying on different ways to bring that \nknowledge into their external world. The participants’ gendered knowledge and its \nexpressive manifestations aided in their movement toward leading a holistically healthy \nlife. Being well, especially for a transgender person, means knowing who you are at a \nbasic level, and being able to express that without editing or hiding parts of yourself. \nWellness is a combination of psychological, emotional, social, and physical health. The \ninterviews revealed three elements of movement toward wellness: A.) Ability for Self-\nReflection, B.) Improvement in Health, and C.) Increased Self-Reliance.  \nSub-Theme A: Ability for Self-Reflection \nOne crucial aspect of a healthy self-image is the ability to see and accept your \nown position within the greater world of overlapping social identities. Every category of \nhuman identity overlaps with many other categories to create relative positions of \n\t 68\t\nprivilege and disadvantage. These are based on many factors including race, economic \nclass, language, geographic location, time period, ability, and sexual orientation. While a \ntransgender man or a transgender woman may be considered more privileged than a non-\nbinary/genderqueer/agender/genderfluid person in terms of gender identity alone, no \nsocial identity can be viewed as a single or stand-alone vector for analysis. A deep \nunderstanding of oneself should prompt an understanding of how one’s identity is \nsituated as compared to others in the same community.  \nEvery participant in this study was white, and while none of them explicitly stated \nthat their race gave them privilege within the transgender community, many of them \nunderstood that their relative privilege made them feel safer and more secure than other \ntransgender people. Alex explains her awareness of the extra labor transgender people \ntake on, as well as her awareness of her own privilege: \nLittle everyday struggles that are so much harder sometimes, for myself, but also \nfor my kid, learning about this and talking about this. Things that are irritations to \npeople, and can frustrate them, are elevated to an extent where people become \nhopeless and lost and not willing to continue on in their lives. And sometimes we \ncan find these big moments that are horrible that happened to them, but a lot of \ntimes it’s just constant berating and criticism and having everyone looking at \nthem like that. You know?... \nSo I think it gives me more empathy probably. I do feel it, but at the same time \nnot at the extent of what other people are having to go through. So I am the first \none to say I am very fortunate that way. I’m very fortunate. \n \nWhen her children started to realize their own identities as sexual and gender minorities, \nAlex began to better understand how she could use her self-reflection to mentor them: \nI have children now in the (LGBTQIA) community. And I think that it helps me \nto be even stronger in who I am. Not just try to squish who I am back into what \nI’m supposed to be. Because I can’t do that. Because I need to support them and \nbecause I need to be a good example for them that we don’t have to hide in a \ncloset. \n \n\t 69\t\n Agrippa also reflected on how their identity put them at risk, while \nsimultaneously recognizing that they were in a relative position of security:  \nI haven’t been verbally abused by anybody, I haven’t been attacked by anybody \nor anything. But it still feels like I can feel that unsafety a little bit. When I go out \nto very public spaces when I’m dressed the way that I wanna be. And so I’m \nalways kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop. And I’m not sure if or when I’m \nactually going to have to experience that…  \nI read about others’ experiences, and the intense hate and judgment and \naggression in a lot of cases with people, against trans people, that I’ve thankfully \nnot experienced yet. Aside of just that I can feel people’s eyes on me. \n \n Megan, through their relationship with a transgender woman, began to realize \ntheir relative privilege as someone who often presents on the masculine end of the \nspectrum and who is able to hide their identity when they need to be safe:  \nI just started dating somebody who’s also trans, and that’s been interesting. \nBecause people don’t usually question as much someone who looks like a girl \npresenting more masculine. It’s just like: ‘Oh, a tomboy’ or you know it’s \nacceptable. But the other way around, you get stares or people mutter underneath \ntheir breath as they’re passing you. And it’s really frustrating, I get really \ndefensive. You know? I care about this person. And there’s people muttering and \nbeing rude…  \nIt’s made me notice how easily I can move through society versus how she does. \nThat I don’t have to worry about certain things. I wish it were different. It just \nmakes me consider things a lot more about where is safe. Where, can we go, and \nwhat’s our exit strategy? That kind of a thing. \n \n Another aspect of self-reflection that emerged was the participants’ ability to \nmake meaning out of past experiences and connect them to their identity development. \nFor example, Max realized how both their academic background and their relationship \nwith to body type solidified their acceptance of their non-binary identity. They reflected: \nI feel like I like went to gender studies and feminism, this is a newer realization \nfor me, as a way to try to understand accepting myself as a woman. For a really \nlong time. Like: ‘I’m oppressed’. And I used to think that the box for women, I \nshould be stretching that box. Instead of like: ‘I just don’t belong in that box’. \nAnd so I spent a really long time in my life trying and trying and trying to \nreconcile that. And mostly doing it, but never feeling one hundred percent… \n\t 70\t\n \nI started to lose weight a little bit. I used to be about sixty or seventy pounds \nheavier than I am now. And realizing I’m still not comfortable with my body. I \nused to think it was a fat woman thing, and realizing it’s actually not. It’s a gender \nthing”.  \n \nThe participants’ ability to look back and reflect on their experiences showed a certain \namount of comfort in their knowledge of self. Their reflections pointed to a deeper sense \nof confidence and general health that came with being more true to themselves. \nSub-Theme B: Improvement in Health \nDuring their interviews, the participants each found their own way to describe the \nchanges that occurred when they were able to lift some of the burdens of confusion, \ndoubt, and self-policing that they had been carrying for so long. It was clear from their \naccounts that they felt a distinct change in their overall health when they were able to \naccept themselves and be recognized and supported by others. For some, this meant an \nincreased sense of emotional security, for others it was a noticeable decline in the \nphysical and mental ailments that hey had become accustomed to.   \nAgrippa discussed the physiological changes they noticed when they no longer \nfelt pressure to conform to gender expectations and roles:  \nI look back at pictures of me, just a couple of years ago, and I look like a different \nperson. And I think it has a lot to do with all of this tension that was being held in \nmy facial muscles. So that’s just opened my entire body up to a full range of \nexpression that wasn’t available to me before. That felt like it had to be kept \nbound inside this box… \nI feel different when I’m wearing female-coded clothing. And I’ll notice that \nthere’s a lot less tension in my body. Like of hips and arms and wrists and things. \nPlaces where I would normally hold tension when I was ‘Playing a guy’. \n \nMegan felt the emotional benefits of expressing their gender in ways that were more \naffirming, especially as they changed their interactions with other people: \n\t 71\t\nI feel so much more confident. You know being brought up as a girl, oftentimes \nyou’re told: ‘don’t express yourself too forcefully. And don’t be a bitch’, \nbasically. But now I’ve started coming into my own… \nLike over a few weeks I just started dropping my voice lower and lower. And I \nwas really excited because I could get my voice out there much louder. And \npeople could hear me. I didn’t sound like background noise anymore. So getting \nthat response, and noticing my own power, has been very cool. \nWhile Alex still struggles to feel completely authentic and supported, she has \nfound an internal source of resilience and patience. With a better understanding of her \ngender identity, she is able to see how her relationship to her identity impacts her health: \nIt has helped me in a lot of struggles to see where I’m at versus other people. And \nto be ok with where I’m at and where I’m going. So mental health wise I think it’s \nbetter. But physical health wise I think it’s been more of a stress for me. But that’s \njust because my emotions and my physical health can be tied pretty closely. \nWhich I wish it wasn’t. And I don’t know maybe if things ever change then I \ncould say that once I was able to be completely comfortable and not restrictive, \nthan maybe that would change. I would like to think it would.  \n \nOverall, the participants discussed prohibitive/negative factors in their interviews more \nfrequently than they did affirming/positive factors. That said, the majority of the negative \nfactors discussed were either tied to a sense of confusion and inner struggle before \ncoming out, or were focused on temporary environmental and social factors. The positive \naspects discussed largely focused on moments and changes that occurred after the \nparticipants realized and began to express/share their gender identities. These positive \nfactors were less likely to change, as they were rooted in the participants’ movement \nfrom relying on others’ expectations of them, to relying on their own internal motivations \nand desires.   \nSub-Theme C: Increased Self-Reliance \n \nThe participants’ stories and memories painted a clear picture of the pressure they \nfelt to conform to the expectations of those around them. They described a lifelong \n\t 72\t\nfeeling that there was something different about them, and many reported feeling as \nthough they could not or should not share their feelings with those around them. This \nshame and confusion led the participants to change their gender expression in order to \nappease society’s explicit and implicit expectations for them. But their paths toward \nliving authentically have been marked by a journey relying less on the pressures around \nthem and more on their own internal compass. \nEach participant discussed how they manage, in their own way, to step away from \nsome from some of their external pressures to conform and toward their own desire to be \nconfident in their non-binary gender identity.  For Agrippa, this meant paying less regard \nto what others may think of them. They talked about the freeing feeling that comes with \nthis new sense of internal confidence and truth: \nI’ve gotten pretty good about not giving a fuck. And really just going with \nhowever I feel, devil may care. And if anybody else is gonna receive it in a certain \nway, I have no control over that anyway. I think that was a really liberating \ndiscovery. That the only thing that I have control over in this situation is myself \nand my feelings. And if I’m gonna be true to that, that’s gonna feel the best for \nme.  \n \nFor Alex, the pressures of her work and home environment still largely dictate her gender \nexpression. She reported that it gives her strength and encouragement to find the \nmoments when she can feel affirmed in being seen as something other than 100 percent \nfemale. \nThere are certain days when I’ve had people look at me funny in the bathroom… \nBut instead of feeling insulted, or even scared, there was just so much good \nfeeling to it. That ‘Ok. I kind of want more of this’. And I think that’s an indicator \ntoo… \nI’m not really sure where I fit. But I don’t care anymore. \n \n\t 73\t\n Both Megan and Max discussed a newfound sense of peace within the process of \nself-discovery. In relying on their own needs and feelings, instead of the expectations \nprojected on them from the worldviews of others, Megan is content for now knowing that \nthey are on a journey toward further self-discovery. They said: \nI don’t know where it’s gonna lead or how it’s gonna evolve. But I know it will. It \nhas before this. So why wouldn’t it continue to evolve?...  \nI don’t have the answer. And that doesn’t really fit with the narrative that most of \nus are brought up with. And until that’s challenged, people don’t even realize it…  \nI’m becoming more comfortable with: ‘I don’t know’. \n \nMax understands that their gender expression causes people to assume things about them, \nand that those assumptions usually fall within the binary framework we are all taught \ngrowing up. However, Max now relies on the strength and confidence they have built in \nrecent years to stop themself from looking back with regret. They are open to further \nchange and development, but understand that even as small changes occur, they are \nguided by a life-long sense of their own identity. \nMy gender expression has always been authentic. I think I just let people interpret \nmy gender identity however they were projecting onto me… \nSometimes I’m like: “I wish I had done this (come out/transition) when I was \nyounger”. But at the same time it’s life. It would’ve been different then, and it \nfeels fine. And I’m not one of those people who looks back at years and thinks \nthat they were awful because I wasn’t living my whole true self…  \nI’m still me. Like, my soul is the same. I’ve had a lot of forms. So, I don’t know. \nIt’s a whole life-long process, is how I see it. \n \nThe positive feelings and increased internal strength that participants reported \ncame from a sense of finally understanding what their gender meant, knowing that they \nwere not alone, and realizing that the societal pressures they felt were unavoidable but \ncould not change their authentic understanding of self.  \nEssential Pattern: Cultivating Self-Realization \n\t 74\t\nAs evidenced by the significant excerpts in their interviews and the essential themes that \nemerged from them, the participants in this study showed that their essential experience \nof the phenomenon of non-binary gender identity was one of cultivating self-realization. \nSelf- realization means that a person is fulfilling their own potential. With regards to \ngender, cultivating self-realization means that one is taking action to move toward living \na life in which the full potential of their gender identity and expression can be realized. \nThis experience of cultivation was marked by the participants’ emphasized discussion of \nthe internal recognition of their gender identity as non-binary, the external presentation of \ntheir non-binary gender identity in the social world, and a movement toward overall \nphysical, mental, and emotional wellness in relationship with their gender.  \n \n\t 75\t\nCHAPTER 7 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n \nImplications for Future Research \n My hope is that this study might serve as a model for researchers (especially those \nwith cisgender identities) who wish to research non-binary gender identity in the U.S. \nThis study models doing research with, not on, a marginalized community, using the \nparticipant’s own voices as the basis for knowledge production, and engaging in honest \nreflection about the researcher’s own position. This study also models how to discuss \ngender, transgender, and gender identity, without discussing sexual orientation to the \nsame extent. So much of the past research on gender identity has conflated gender \nidentity with sexual orientation, partly because the LGBT community groups these two \naspects of identity together for the purpose of community and social change.  \nBut this conflation is also partly because our current terminology for sexual \norientation still mostly revolves around labeling one’s own gender (as male or female) \nand their potential partner’s gender (as male or female). Of course the term bisexual \ninvokes a binary categorization of gender, but the terms homosexual and heterosexual \n(homo- meaning the same as, hetero- meaning different from) are culturally understood \nwithin a binary system of men who are attracted to either men or women, and women \nwho are attracted to either women or men. Think of how a non-binary person might \nstruggle to identify their sexual orientation within these confines. If, for example, a non-\nbinary person is exclusively attracted to women/femmes/femininity, how do they \ndescribe this? Even though their attraction rests on one end of the spectrum, they are not \n\t 76\t\ngay, straight, or bisexual. And what about someone who is attracted to transgender people \nor non-binary people specifically? Has such a desire been so far from the imagination of \nmost English speakers that we have not been able to develop our lexicon to include it? \nThis is, of course, where terms like queer come in handy, but they are much less specific \nif someone is trying to convey what types of people they are attracted to.  \nThese examples represent how gender identity is constitutive factor in one’s \nidentification with a sexual orientation label. However, it is clear that one’s gender \nidentity exists independently from, and oftentimes before, one’s sexual orientation. By \nstudying transgender people’s experience of themselves in relationship with gender, not \nin sexual or romantic relationships with other people, we begin to understand more about \nthe identity formation and inner life of transgender people. This focus also helps to \nseparate transgender people from pathologizing narratives that frame us as sexually \nunderdeveloped or the objects of fetishes. The known history of transgender Americans is \nrelatively young, and researchers have a chance now to represent our community in ways \nthat do not hinder future generations’ ability to explore gender and attain authenticity and \nself-love.  \nThis study can also inform further quantitative research on non-binary identity \nand inform demographic survey questions so that they best represent non-binary people. \nFinally, it is my hope to share most of the transcripts of my interviews in a separate \ndatabase to be used for secondary content analysis research and to be an added source for \nsharing non-binary experience in a self-authored way. Researchers who are interested in \nthis topic but have trouble finding a sample could use this data as a starting point. At the \n\t 77\t\nvery least, this study models how to use they/them pronouns when referring to research \nstudy participants.  \n \nImplications for Non-Binary U.S. Americans \n While, as stated in the previous chapters, phenomenological results can only be \nread as “suggestive rather than conclusive” (Burdge, 2013, p. 221), this study contributes \nto research focused on illuminating the experiences of transgender people who exist \noutside of a binary gender system. The essential pattern of self-realization suggests that \ntransgender identity (so long as it differs from the dominant/majority narrative of sex-\ngender-alignment) is marked by an experience of self-reflection and a longing for the \nfreedom to live fully and authentically. However, many other factors still determine if \nself-realization is attainable or not. For instance, if one desires to alter their body in some \nway to align their internal feeling with their external form, self-realization becomes either \ndeterred or enabled by one’s financial situation. Similarly, as was evidenced in the \ninterviews, living authentically as a non-binary transgender person means the potential \nfor changes in one’s friendships, romantic life, and family, change that is not always \npositive.  \n Even if one has the internal fortitude and external support to come out, express, \nand live openly in community as a non-binary person, there is still a lack of legal \nrecognition for non-binary people in 49 of 50 U.S. states. Since the majority of current \nresearch on non-binary people has been conducted within the fields of medicine and \npsychology, and since medical and psychological experts have in the past advocated for \nthe validity of transgender identity in ways that have changed our legal status, my hope is \n\t 78\t\nthat continued research and understanding of non-binary gender identities within these \nfields will change the daily lives of non-binary people for the better. By conducting this \nresearch outside of these fields, I also hope to expand the conversation about non-binary \npeople as part of public life and community into the social sciences in new ways, and to \nreach an audience of future transgender students and academics.  \n The participants in this study described their experiences of recognizing their \ninternal knowledge of gender identity and of discovering that people were rejecting the \n(man/transman v. woman/transwoman) binary. They described the feelings and \nrealizations that led them to reject binary gender categorization for themselves and for \nsociety. They shared their experiences of presenting their internal truth to their external \nenvironments, for better or worse. They discussed the ways in which their overall well \nbeing improved as a result of understanding themselves and expressing that \nunderstanding more openly. They shared their hopes for a future in which they can be \nthemselves and fulfill their potential in all aspects of life. While the participants in this \nstudy do not represent all non-binary transgender people in the U.S., they paint a very \nclear picture of the unique experience of cultivating self-realization through the process \nof discovering and living into one’s gender beyond the binary. \n\t 79\t\nNOTES \n1. Throughout the course of this document, I use the word ‘their’ in the singular \nform. While it is considered correct English grammar to use ‘their’ in only the plural \nform, I use it in the singular because the English-speaking transgender community has \nrecently adopted ‘their’ as a singular gender pronoun and because many non-binary \npeople use this pronoun to refer to themselves. Conjugations of the singular pronoun \n‘they’ that occur frequently throughout this text include: them, their, and themself.  \n \n \n \n\t 80\t\nREFERENCES \nAlcoff, L., & Potter, E. (1993).

If so, how has \nthis changed your daily life?  \n \nClarifying questions and follow-up questions to elicit deeper descriptions will be given \nthroughout (i.e. “What do you mean by that?” or “Can you say more?”)  \n\t 90\t\nAPPENDIX D \n \nCONSENT FORM – SOCIAL BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH \n\t 91\t\nConsent Form: Social Behavioral  \nTitle of the Research Study: Transgender Experiences Beyond the Binary: A \nPhenomenological Study of Arizonans with Non-Binary Gender Identities  \nInvestigator: Ashton Skinner  \nWhy am I being invited to take part in a research study?  \nWe invite you to take part in a research study because you identify with a non-binary \ngender (that is, your gender identity is something other than always/exclusively male or \nalways/exclusively female.  \nWhy is this research being done?  \nThis study aims to better understand the experiences of people within the transgender \ncommunity who identify their gender as non-binary (that is, other than ‘always and \nexclusively male’ or ‘always and exclusively female’) as it pertains to their lived \nexperience and daily life. The study will be conducted using phenomenological interview \nmethods in order to get at the self-understanding of gender that participants have as well \nas the real lived experience of being transgender and non-binary. A few \nphenomenological studies have been done on transgender people, but none have focused \nspecifically on non-binary or genderqueer/fluid trans identities.  \nHow long will the research last?  \nWe expect that individuals will spend between 30 minutes and two hours total \nparticipating in the proposed activities.  \nHow many people will be studied?  \nWe expect about 5 people will participate in this research study.  \nWhat happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?  \nYou are free to decide whether you wish to participate in this study. If you do participate, \nyou will be asked to complete a very short online survey and to conduct a 30-60 minute \ninterview with the researcher in-person. The interview will be video recorded to aid in the \nanalysis portion of the study. All video recordings will be safely secured in a password-\nprotected file and will never be released or published. All recordings will be destroyed at \nthe end of the study. All portions of the survey and interview process are voluntary and \nnot mandatory. All personally identifiable data and video recordings will be held in a \nsecure place and destroyed at the end of the study and your name and contact information \nwill never be published. You will be given an opportunity to read the study \nreport/findings and to clarify anything that does not represent you before the study is \nsubmitted to a thesis committee for review or publication. You will not be paid in any \nway for your participation in this study.  \nWhat happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?  \nYou can leave the research at any time it will not be held against you.  \n \n\t 92\t\nIs there any way being in this study could be bad for me?  \nTalking about your gender identity and your experience with gender may (or may not) be \na subject that can be tied to past negative experiences or could bring up painful \nmemories. You should be prepared for any emotions that may accompany discussing \nthese topics and know that the researcher (as a non-binary trans person) will treat the \ninterviews with care, empathy, and respect.  \nWill being in this study help me in any way? \nWe cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. \nHowever, the interview process will give you an opportunity to reflect on and give voice \nto your experience with regards to gender, and may prove as a gratifying process in that \nway. \nWhat happens to the information collected for the research? \nEfforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, \nincluding research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. \nWe cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your \ninformation include the University board that reviews research who want to make sure \nthe researchers are doing their jobs currently and protecting your information and rights. \nAll identifying information will be removed from the final thesis. \nWho can I talk to? \nIf you have questions, concerns, or complaints, you can contact the research team: \nAshton Skinner (ashton.skinner@asu.edu) and Dr. Jennifer Sandlin \n(jennifer.sandlin@asu.edu)  \n \nThis research has been reviewed and approved by the Social Behavioral IRB.

    "abstract": "abstract: This phenomenological study explores the question: What are the lived experiences of Arizonans who identify their gender identities as ‘non-binary’? (‘non-binary’ defined here as anyone who identifies their gender as something other than ‘always and exclusively male or always and exclusively female’). The study explores the lived realities of four non-binary identified transgender people living in Arizona. Each participant took a short survey and conducted a 45-minute in-person interview, conducted through phenomenological questioning to evoke deep descriptions of experience. After analyzing the results through feminist hermeneutic phenomenology, this study suggests that the experience of non-binary gender identity presents an essential pattern of cultivating self-realization. The essential themes of internal recognition, external presentation, and movement toward wellness fell into this pattern. The United States has conceptualized transgender identity in many ways, from pathologizing to politicizing, to medically affirming views. Although the literature on this topic is quite small, there is no doubt that non-binary transgender people exist in U.S. public life. Ultimately, if non-binary people are to find affirming paths toward self-realization, they must be heard from their own experiences in their own voices.Dissertation/ThesisMasters Thesis Social and Cultural Pedagogy 201",
