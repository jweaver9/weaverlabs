With regard to this the European Commission launched a strategy in 2020 with focus on \nequal rights for LGBTIQ individuals with an indication that healthcare and gender-inclusive \nlanguage are pivotal areas for strengthening equality and representation. Therefore, this thesis \nis aimed to examine the structure of gender-neutral language in medical and healthcare contexts, \nin regard to how different gender identities and pronouns are represented. Whether it is \ninclusive or not. With a delimitation to Sweden this was done through a qualitative discourse-\nbased text analysis of ten articles from the healthcare sites 1177 Vårdguiden and UMO.se. \nSeveral theories from gender studies were applied to explain the current structure and \ncomposition of the gender-neutral language used in the articles. The result indicates that a \ngender-neutral language currently exists to the extant where neutral concepts as “person”, \n“your” and similar are used. However, it is not particularly inclusive regarding usage of \ndifferent identities and pronouns.  \n \n \nBachelor thesis: 15 credits \nProgramme: European Studies Programme \nLevel: First Cycle \nSemester year: Autumn 2021 \nSupervisor: Katarzyna Wojnicka  \nKeyword: Gender-neutral language, Gender Identity, Hen, Non-binary, Pronouns, Healthcare, European Union, Sweden \nWord count: 11466 \n \n \n \n \nTable of content \nOperationalisation of terms ........................................................................................................ 1 \n1.

Therefore, the below definitions of the terms are provided in relation \nto how they were used in this specific paper.  \n \nGender identity: refers to an individual’s self-experienced gender. That is, the gender one feels \nthat one have and identifies with. It can be woman, man, non-binary or other. \n \nGender binary: refers to the expectation and notion that there are only two genders, either \nmale or female (man or woman) based on the anatomy of the genitals. The assigned gender at \nbirth aligns with the social constructs of masculine and feminine expressions and identity.   \n \nNon-binary gender: are on the other hand here used as an umbrella term for every individual \nwho identifies themselves with a gender outside of the gender binary of male and female. These \ndifferent genders may be agender, genderfluid, bigender, demigender, genderqueer etc.  \n \nLGBTIQ: is used as the collective name for lesbians, gays, bisexuals, trans, non-binary, \nintersex and queer individuals. The first three refers to sexuality, the following two refer to how \none identifies their gender, intersex refers to how the body breaks norms about gender and queer \ncan be about both sexuality and gender identity. This specific definition of the term is used \nsince it is the one the source material for this thesis uses.  \n \nHen: is the Swedish gender-neutral pronoun that is used in situations where someone’s gender \nis irrelevant, or their identity is unknown. It can be used by non-binary individuals instead of \nusing the gender pronouns of she or he. The English terms they/them are the closest pronouns \nthat can be compared to hen. However, hen will be the term used in the results and analysis \nsince it has its own definition and they/them are more directly linked to the Swedish de/dem \nand will solely be used in relation to those.  \n(Transformering, 2021; RFSL, 2021). \n \n   \n \n2 \n1. Introduction \nDuring recent years there has been a rise in visibility of individuals who advocate for and \nidentify with genders outside the gender-binary of female and male, which may be referred to \nthe umbrella term of identifying as non-binary (Twist & de Graaf, 2019; Richards et al., 2016). \nIt results in, among others, an increase in the usage of gender neutral or third-personal (other \nthan he/she) pronouns. Although the rise of advocacy has led to an increase of recognition in \nlegal and medical systems and resulted in a growing social acceptance along with changing \nattitudes towards different genders identities and pronouns, this group of individuals is still \nbeing marginalized and face discrimination in many ways (Richards et al., 2016; European \nCommission, 2020).  \n \nIn regards to the continued exclusion and discrimination towards individuals identifying outside \nwhat is still considered the “norm” of gender, the European Commission adopted “The \nLGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2020-2025\" (COM(2020)698) in November of 2020. This strategy \nis the first ever comprehensive Commission strategy aimed at focussing on the equal rights for \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, non-binary, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) individuals across the \nEU. The purpose is to build a Union, together with all member states and actors, where diversity \nis recognised and valued, and individuals can be whomever they wish, free from discrimination, \nexclusion or violence. The strategy indicates that healthcare is an area pivotal for increasing \nequality and representation in the way that it mentions how many individuals hide the fact that \nthey are LGBTIQ from medical staff and healthcare providers, in fears of being misunderstood \nor discriminated. The strategy therefore suggests that work for equality needs to be done within \nhealthcare systems on many levels. Part of the strategy is also to strive for an inclusive working \nenvironment by, for one, significantly improve the usage of gender-inclusive language in all \ncommunication (COM(2020)698).  \n \nThis means that language issues are one, amongst the problems that non-binary individuals \nface, and hence, the thesis is going to focus on this particular issue. A problem with the current \nlanguage usage in this specific situation lies in the lack of various and correct gender identities \nand pronouns in different forms of contexts due to the fact that referring to and assume \nsomeone’s gender as female or male is still considered the norm. The usage of binary genders \n   \n \n3 \nor gendered pronouns may result in a situation where non-binary individuals feel frustrated and \ndiscriminated because of the invalidation of their identity (Moser & Devereux, 2019). Studies \n(Moser & Devereux, 2019; Gustafsson Sendén, Bäck & Lindqvist, 2015; Gustafsson Sendén, \nRenström & Lindqvist, 2021) have shown that the usage of diverse gender-neutral language in \ntexts and speech over time may lead to an increase of not only usage, but acceptance of gender \nidentities and pronouns amongst the general population. However, it is still unclear what affect \nthe usage of gender-neutral, or inclusive, language and the followed acceptance for individuals \nidentifying outside the norm of female/male are. Furthermore, there is also very little \nknowledge of how a gender-neutral language is used and structured in different forms and if \nsuch a language should be better structured or not.  \n \n \n1.1 Aim \nWith regard to the Commissions strategy’s acknowledgement of healthcare and language usage, \nand to the lack of knowledge on gender-neutral language the aim of the essay is therefore to \nexplore what a gender-neutral (or gender-inclusive) language might look like in medical and \nhealthcare contexts. And if such a language exists, look at the format and the shape of it, in \nwhat way is it inclusive and not.   \n \nSince examining the whole of EU might be too broad for the thesis this will be done through a \ndelimitation to Sweden, by looking at a Swedish medical and healthcare context as a form of \ncritical case (Yin, 2018 p. 49). From an EU perspective the Swedish context are of interest since \nthe work for general equality amongst individuals are considered to have come further there \nthan in majority of EU members states. For example, the Swedish government have launched \nboth a strategy and an action plan (Regeringskansliet, 2014, 2021), like the one the European \nCommissions introduced, regarding equal rights for LGBTIQ individuals. In the strategy, “En \nstrategi för lika rättigheter och möjligheter oavsett sexuell läggning, könsidentitet eller \nkönsuttryck” (Regeringskansliet, 2014), suggestions similar with the Commission strategy can \nbe found. Another relevant element is that it also indicates that healthcare is an area pivotal for \nenhancing quality and representation. The Swedish strategy suggests that everyone has the right \nto care without discrimination, exclusion or negative treatment regardless of gender identity \n   \n \n4 \nand sexual identity. The strategy also acknowledges that the civil society plays an important \nrole in the maintenance of human rights and spreading of knowledge through communication, \namong other things. In addition, Sweden is also one of few European countries where a third-\npersonal pronoun, hen, is semi established in the general language usage in both speech and \ntext form.  \n \nThrough this view point Sweden is therefore considered to be one of the most gender advanced \ncountries. So, if the gender-neutral language are constructed and used in a specific way there, \nthen what is true for the rest of EU? If Sweden is supposed to be the best and a gender-neutral \nlanguage are found to be non-existent or ill-structured, then how far could the other EU member \nstates have come with their gender-neutral language. It is therefore important to first explore \nthe Swedish context before broadening the research to other EU member states since they, in \nthis aspect, cannot have come further than Sweden in their work for a more neutral and inclusive \nlanguage structure and usage. \n \nIn relation to the above, research questions that this paper intends to answer are thus the \nfollowing:  \nRQ1: How is gender neutral language constructed in medical and healthcare texts, in regard \nto how different gender identities and pronouns are presented?  \nRQ1a: Is it inclusive or not and in what way?  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n5 \n2. Theory and previous research \n2.1 Previous research  \nIn regard to previous research on gender issues, there is a fair number of studies in general, \nsince the subject is a well-established element of contemporary social sciences. However, when \nit comes to the issue of gender identities and gender-neutral language the research is still rather \nlimited in comparison to other aspects of gender research (presumably given to the fact that \ninclusion and recognition of differences is relatively new in many different levels of society). \nThis chapter therefore focuses on three main themes found in current research that centre around \nthe paper´s specific angle: perceptions of the binary and the non-binary genders, rights and \nrepresentation for non-binary persons and gender-neutral language.  \n \n2.1.1 Perceptions of the binary- and non-binary genders \nThe term gender has long been seen as an interactive and attributed phenomenon which refers \nto masculine or feminine feelings of oneself, in other words the perception of one’s own internal \nself regardless of the genital anatomy. Robert Stoller describes gender “As a psychological \nstate, a complex evolving intrapersonal and interpersonal experience” (Kirkpatrick, 2003, p. \n560), something that can be a constant changing process.  \n \nSince notion of gender often refer to masculine or feminine traits, based on social stereotypes \nand norms, research on gender identity often has focused on the genders of men and women. \nHowever, gender identity can in fact include the feeling of being either female, male- hence the \nfeeling of a binary gender identity, or ambiguous - the feeling of a non-binary gender identity \n(Kirkpatrick, 2003; Nicholas, 2019). Identifying with a binary gender can be understood as \nfeelings of being either male or female. The gender binarism often refers to the concept of \nunderstanding that only two genders exist, or as Nicholas (2019) and Matsuno and Budge \n(2017), among other calls it, bigenderism or the two-gender system. Matsuno and Budge (ibid.) \npoint out that this system means that an infant gets assigned a binary gender right at birth and \nis therefore brought up with binary expectations and intuitions that are considered to be within \nthe norm.  \n \n   \n \n6 \nA non-binary gender identity can instead be seen as an umbrella term for a range of identities \nand experiences for those individuals who identify with anything but the gender binary. These \nidentities may be in-between or fall outside male and female, both male and female- all the time \nor at specific times, or it can be that one does not wish to have a specific gender identity (Monro, \n2019; Twist & de Graaf, 2019). A few terms used by those who are non-binary to describe their \nidentities are agender, genderfluid, bigender, demigender, pangender, trigender, genderqueer \nand so on. Twist and de Graaf (2019) point out that individuals may use a variance of terms to \ndescribe their identity that may also change within time and contexts. These identities may also \nhave different meaning to given individuals, and the definitions of the terms are something that \npeople themselves decides.  \n \nThese various diverse non-binary identities are often something that is seen as a challenge to \ndifferent social institutions and contexts that maintain the binary genders. As said above one \ngets assigned a binary gender at birth and is therefore brought up within the norm. But for non-\nbinary individuals this assignment of gender and perception of the norm, often lead to \ndifficulties in gaining acceptance of their identity from others and society (Monro, 2019). West \nand Zimmerman (1987; Darwin, 2017) suggest that even though there is a shift in gender norms \nwhere gender is starting to exist in a less restrictive form, social change will not happen unless \nthe gender debate starts to evolve beyond a binary framework. Non-binary genders have the \npotential to do just that, transform gender into something more inclusive, but this ability is still \nconditional because it remains dependent on being recognized by others, both society and \ngender theorists.  \n \n2.1.2 Rights and representation for non-binary persons \nIn order to equally recognise non-binary gender identities, with the binary gender identities, \nchanges in their social perceptions are required. Nicholas (2019) and Matsuno and Budge \n(2017), amongst others, show that the higher rate of discrimination and marginalization non-\nbinary individuals are exposed to may be to the fact that their genders is considered to be a \ndeviation from the gender binary, bigenderism. These attitudes may therefore lead to social \nconsequences such as expressions about how non-binary identities are less legitimate or how \nnon-binary individuals often need to justify their own identities. Moreover Nicholas (2019) \n   \n \n7 \nespecially discusses how this hostility may come from the lack of knowledge, social- and \ncultural resources outside of the gender binary that makes it impossible for non-binaries to be \nunderstood in these heteronormative contexts.  \n \nWhile Nicholas (ibid) mentions that some research point to a solution to the problems that non-\nbinary individuals face, the solution itself stems from these individuals and not from the areas \nin society where the attitudes toward genders stem from. In contrary to this Nicholas (ibid.) \nargues for an approach where focus lies on the mindsets of the binary population in a variety of \nsocial contexts. Specifically, they speak of a long-lasting aim towards encouraging a positive \nmindset of otherness, which would reduce the harmful perception of gender and create a more \ninclusive environment. Nicholas (ibid.) claims that this would be more valuable and long lasting \nthan attempts to tackle individualized attitudes. However, these are proposals that needs further \nexamination and valuation.  \n \nAdditionally, research also show that non-binary genders are increasingly being recognized as \na social identity, which have led to changes in norms and structures. For example, in legal, \nmedical, psychosocial systems and by adding non-binary identity options in some countries. \nMonro (2019) also points that these new possibilities for the expression of gender can be both \nfragile and selective. Richards et al. (2015) take up the matter on that many non-binary groups \nmay chose the easier way in using their birth-assigned gender in day-to-day business because \nmany systems only recognize the binary genders, even though third options may be available. \nMost societal structures and institutions, including languages, bathroom systems and clothing \nstores are as of now therefore not very inclusive regarding diverse gender identities. This makes \neveryday life challenging for these individuals where many walk around in fear of rejection and \ndiscrimination. Researchers claim that a way of changing these different systems even further \nis to educate clinics, schools, legal institutions and so on, on how to approach and communicate \nwith individuals in an inclusive and non-discriminating way. This may be done by showing an \nopenness for diversity and using gender-inclusive language in different forms (Matsuno & \nBudge, 2017; Monro, 2019).  \n \n   \n \n8 \n2.1.3 Gender-neutral language \nEven though there has been a usage of gender-neutral language for some time, this usage has \nnot had quite the same motivation as the one promoted for non-binary identities. According to \nGustafsson Sendén et al. (2021) most language improvements has so far been done to make \nwomen more notable compared to men. For instance, by promoting the generic use of he/she \ninstead of only he, or humankind instead of mankind. But since there has been an increase in \nawareness for genders outside the binary, this gender-neutral language rather results in a \ngender-inclusive one.  \n \nNow there is rather a suggestion and initiative, as mentioned above, aimed at different systems \nand individuals in society to use the correct gender identity label and preferred pronouns in all \nforms of communications. The reason for this is that many non-binary individuals often use \ndifferent pronouns than he/she to express their gender. Instead, they may use more neutral ones \nas they/them/their or zie/hir/hirs from the English language, or other various ones depending \non which language one uses (Matsuno & Budge, 2017). Different research (ibid.; Twist & de \nGraaf, 2019) has shown that using the correct pronouns and gender identity or gender-neutral \nterms in general is a sign of support for diverse identities which may lead non-binary individuals \nto not feel misgendered, unsafe and misunderstood. The same research (Twist & de Graaf, \n2019) also show that adolescents (the subject of their study) best understood their genders \nthrough support from social media, tv programmes, other non-binaries, family and friends and \ntheir own inner feelings.  \n \nOne specific study by Gustafsson Sendén et al. (2015) and the follow up (2021) showed the \nimportance of time when introducing gender-neutral words into a language. While exploring \nthe use and perception of the Swedish gender-neutral pronoun hen during the first years after \nits introduction into the Swedish language, they found out that time was an important factor in \nusage and perception. While their study showed that a gender neutral (or fair) language may be \nmet with negative reactions and attacks at first, they also saw that these attitudes turned into \nsomething positive rather quickly during a two-year period. There was also change in the usage \nof the word, even though this change was not as fast and broad. Regardless the authors point \nout this as an important message, in the way that it should motivate a language change even \n   \n \n9 \nthough there may be strong reactions against such an implementation in the beginning \n(Gustafsson Sendén et al., 2015, 2021).  \n \nAnother study by Jetubhai and Ghosal (2019) focuses on literature and what impact usage of \nungendered narratives in stories may have on and for individuals. They point out that when one \nreads a story of some sort, they immediately get a mental picture of this character, their gender, \nlooks, personality and so on. In their meaning writing characters that are kept as anonyms as \npossible instead of descriptive, by using an ungendered narrative with gender-neutral pronouns \nand descriptions, may lead to a more gender-inclusive environment. Even though this may not \nhappen immediately they point out that an increase of a gender-neutral language usage might \nbe a possibility over time. Other research that Jetubhai and Ghosal (ibid.) mentions do in fact \npoint to this, where they also note that since languages reflect societies and institutions attitudes, \nthe usage of a proper language is of significance for non-binary individuals’ recognition. \n \n \n2.2 Theory \nGender studies (or gender theory) are in many ways similar to the feminist scholarship which \nis often used when working with gender equality in different societal and scientific contexts. \nHence, it is an appropriate approach to use as a theoretical framework for this paper. There are \na few key theories in this approach, where four of them are applied here: intersectionality, \nperformativity, heteronormativity and biopower.  \n \n2.2.1 Intersectionality  \nThe term intersectionality was popularised by Kimberlé Crenshaw as a mean to criticize the \nperception, in gender research, of women as only women and that there were other factors to \ndiscrimination such as race or ethnicity (Davis, 2011, p.43ff). According to Crenshaw \n(mentioned in Dahl, 2005, p.23) and Nina Lykke (2005) intersectionality can be seen as a \nconcept that aims to describe how different levels of socio-cultural hierarchies and power \nstructures are intertwined with each other to create inclusion or exclusion around constructed \ncategories. How different forms of social phenomena can reconstruct and transform each other, \nsuch as representation of different forms of identities, in this case gender identity and pronouns. \n   \n \n10 \nConcisely, it can be described as the scientific take on discrimination and oppression as a result \nof intersections of many social factors that results in production of various power relations \n(Wojnicka, 2020). \n \nIntersectionality is relevant when it comes to understand, highlight and problematize the \nmechanism behind the principles for supremacy and subordination in social positions regarding \ngender, class, sexuality and ethnicity and what these positions may result in (Molina Vega, de \nlos Reyes & Mulinari, 2003, p.160f). According to de los Reyes and Mulinari (2010) this \nperspective begs the question on how power and inequality are intertwined with the \nassumptions of (amongst other things) gender and heteronormativity which constantly recreates \nperspectives of “we” and “them”. This is done through linguistic construction, material terms \nand everyday actions and is therefore seen as something variable that can solely change over \ntime and space. \n \nDue to this de los Reyes and Mulinari (2010) refers to the fact that it is important to use and see \nintersectionality in a critical way since it opens a way for new and old truths in the production \nof knowledge. The thinking of categorization is an important part of the exercise of power, and \nthe understanding that this power structure can change also means that the meaning behind \nspecific categorization can change. For example, the separation between what is considered the \ngender norm and what is not may change over time, but only if the structure behind the \ncategorization gets questioned and challenged. Hence, the utilisation of intersectional approach \nmay make one see the reality in a different point of view and get one to question the social order \nthat we live in (de los Reyes & Martinsson, 2005, p.19f).  \n \n2.2.2 Performativity and heteronormativity \nPerformativity is the concept used to emphasize the fact that all humans are involved and \nactively link to a specific gender order (which here refers to the gender of male/female), whether \nit is intentionally or not. According to Judith Butler (Butler, 2011; Butler, Rosenberg & \nLindeqvist 2005) genders does not really exist until a gender is assigned to an individual. This \ncan be done through expressions such as ̀ it´s a boy/girl´ just after the birth is completed (Butler, \n2007, 2011), which then in the theorist’s sense results in an active creation of differences \n   \n \n11 \nbetween genders. Performativity is hence a manner in which social actions create and \nreconstruct genders, where the ways individuals act and speak are the primary factors that \nmaintains normative perceptions and ideas about genders. If it were not for these kinds of social \nactions the thoughts of a gender order, which differentiate the genders, would not exist.  \n \nLinked to this, the concept of heteronormativity, is based on the concept of the existence of two \ngenders, female and male, though in different ways. Heteronormativity is based on the notion \nthat only two genders exist (who are additionally supposed to desire each other) where anything \nelse is deviating. Hence the notion that masculine=manly=man and femininity=female=woman \nis the norm and anything outside of this is non-normative. Butler defines this as the heterosexual \nmatrix, which: \n \n“...denotes a model of gender coherence that presupposes that culturally \ncomprehensible bodies must be based on stable sexes. To put it simply: Bodies are \nnot comprehensible in themselves but culture creates comprehensible bodies \nthrough the heterosexual matrix that requires a gender order with two distinctly \nidentifiable sex/genders: one female/feminine and one male/masculine...”. (Butler \net al., 2005 p. 10) \n \nIt is the notion that presumes the natural way to live is through heterosexuality, which is \nmaintained through structures, languages and actions based on the idea of the binary gender \nperception (Butler et al., 2005; Butler, 2007).  \n \nHaving said this, Butler (2007, 2011; Butler et al., 2005) also indicates that there is a possibility, \nsince gender is socially created in this perspective, to make conscious resistance in the making \nof gender by acting in a non-normative way. Even though performativity and heteronormativity \nmainly point to the genders of male and female this thought, along with the changing perception \nof the concepts, makes them relevant to use for this thesis when exploring the construction of a \ngender-neutral language.  \n \n   \n \n12 \n2.2.3 Biopower \nIn the 1970’s Michel Foucault (2002) introduced the concept of biopower to describe the \ndifferent power structures that shape populations, in other words power over lives. Rather than \nexternal power figures the concept of biopower is mainly based on norms embodied by \nindividuals or groups. For example, the biopower categorizes gender and bodies in a way that \ndefines how one speaks about them. In Foucault’s words (2002; Taylor, 2013) this so-called \npower is created and reproduced in every situation and moment and impacts all levels of society. \nWhile this power is there to control individuals in a way that make sure they do not deviate \nfrom the norm, this power also creates opportunities and resistance in different aspects.  \n \n \n   \n \n13 \n3. Method and material \nIn the following chapter the method and material chosen to answer the paper’s questions are \npresented and discussed, starting with the chosen method. \n \n \n3.1 Method \nBoréus and Bergström (2018) refers to the fact that texts relate to humans in a way where they \nhave created them, but how humans are also the one’s the texts addresses. Texts in all their \nforms reflect conscious and subconscious ideas about many different subjects, where these \nideas reproduce and reinforces but also questions the power behind them. The method that has \nbeen used in this paper is therefore a qualitative text analysis in the form of discourse analysis, \nsince it relates to the posed research questions, the material and the chosen theory.  \n \nThe method is useful in a sense that includes studies of the meaning-making behind different \nphenomena and questions. Discourse analysis is hence a sufficient method because it also aims \nto study questions related to power, power relations and the usage of language in discourses. In \nFoucault’s words this point to the fact that power not only can be seen in negative terms, since \nit also can be productive in a way that it produces categories and ideas which differs from other. \nOne can therefore both benefit and be disadvantaged from the effects that power has on \nconceptions of reality (ibid.).  \n \nIn the aftermath of Foucault’s definition of discourse analysis, this method may also be seen as \nan approach to study how certain lore are created, maintained and reproduced. It relates to the \nthought of Foucault in a sense that this lore, just like power, have different effects for various \npeople. Boréus and Bergström (2018) gives the example of how one can be interested in \nsomething framed as problematic. Then one can explore how social practices handles this \nproblem and how the problem can shape and steer over people (like the conception of power).  \n \nFor this paper it is about the way gender-neutral language is constructed, if it is inclusive or not, \nand how this may affect individuals identifying outside the binary. It therefore relates to the \nconcept of language as something socially constructed, which affects individuals in various \n   \n \n14 \nways depending on if one is considered to fall into the line of the binary or non-binary. Note, \nhowever that this form of analysis does not point out language to be a form of reality, rather it \nis understood as one element of the reproduction of perceptions of things. A discourse is also a \nnotion that changes over time depending on social conditions and changes in the interaction \nthat is associated with the actors behind them. In other words, it means that the way gender-\nneutral language is constructed right now have a possibility to change over time (ibid.).  \n \n \n3.2 Material \nBoth mentioned document from the European Commission and those produced by the Swedish \ngovernment brings up the importance for everyone to be able to be whoever they want and do \nwhatever one wants without discrimination. Therefore, both documents mention healthcare and \nlanguage to be important factors for this. The same goes for the previous research presented in \nthe thesis that further show that a proper language usage is of significance for non-binary \nindividuals’ recognition. But there is a question on how such language structure looks like, not \nonly in general but also when it comes to healthcare.  \n \nIn relation to this, and the choice of using discourse analysis, the material used for this paper to \nanswer the research questions consists of different articles and information from two healthcare \nsites. The sites 1177 Vårdguiden and UMO.se (Ungdomsmottagningen), which aim to gather \nand spread information on different topics related to health, care and body. The sites are very \naccessible to the public and are frequently used to look up health related issues through texts. \nThe language in these texts should be inclusive and norm critical in accordance with the site’s \ncommon linguistic guidelines (UMO, n.d.G; 1177 Vårdguiden, 2019b). Since both sites are said \nto use such a language to promote equality, they were fitting examples to use to explore the \nquestion of the thesis. \n \n3.2.1 1177 Vårdguiden \nThis site is aimed for all citizens who wants to access information about diseases, treatments, \nrights and rules. 1177 Vårdguiden is Sweden’s gathering place for user friendly information \n   \n \n15 \nthat eases one’s connection to healthcare in a way that promotes health and increases the publics \nknowledge of it (1177 Vårdguiden, 2021b).  \n \nThe read material from 1177 Vårdguiden are information from twenty-five different articles on \nthe site, this has been done to get an overview of the page. However, when looking at the \nlanguage structure more in detail the focus has been on five specific articles to make the analysis \nclearer. These articles include; “Gender identity and gender expression”, “Menstruation”, \n“Puberty”, “Teenagers 13-18 years” and “What we mean when we write man or woman” (1177 \nVårdguiden, 2017, 2018, 2019a, 2021a, 2021c). The reason for using these specific articles is \ndue to that the topics that some of them address target specific parts of the anatomy and \ndevelopment of the body that are considered to be linked with specific genders. Since they \ntarget, what one can consider, readers with specific genders these articles are interesting texts \nto analyse in relation to other information-based texts found on the site that have a more \nanonymous and factual language structure.  \n \n3.2.2 UMO.se \nJust like the abovementioned site UMO.se, short for the youth clinic, is aimed at those who \nwant information about care and health. Although, the difference is that UMO.se is primarily \naimed for young people in the ages between thirteen and twenty-five, and focuses a lot on \nknowledge about the body, sex, feelings, psychological health and more. Their primary goal is \nfor everyone, no matter who you are, to feel that UMO.se is a site one can use to get knowledge \nabout your rights and possibilities (UMO, n.d.E).  \n \nThe material used from the site, is similar to the information used from 1177 Vårdguiden to \nmake it easier to compare the two sites in the analysis and because they share the same linguistic \nguidelines. Therefore, the read material consists of twenty-four different texts from the site in \ntotal, with a specific focus on five texts just like the former. The analysed texts are as follows; \n“What is equality”, “Your gender does not determine who you are”, “Sexual orientation and \ngender identity”, “About menstruation” and “To enter puberty” (UMO, n.d.A, n.d.B, n.d.D, \nn.d.F & n.d.H.). Similar with 1177 Vårdguiden, the material consists of articles that address \n   \n \n16 \ntopics that may be considered to be linked with a specific biological anatomy. Hence, why they \nare appropriate for being analysed in relation to the research question.   \n \n \n3.3 Method- and material discussion  \nBy using the discourse analysis in relation to the posed question, the previous research and \nchosen material, this thesis makes a small contribution to the research gap on gender-neutral-\nlanguage. This is done by examining how a gender-neutral language might be constructed and \nused in its entirety instead of looking at the effects of the usage of specific neutral terms, as \nprevious research has shown. However, the chosen method and material have some limitations \nwhich are discussed below.  \n \nWhile discourse analysis is a relatively useful method for the thesis, there are a few flaws to it \ndepending on how it is used. When choosing material for the discourse analysis one must \nconsider if the texts reflect the chosen discourse or if it may be too narrow (Boréus & \nBergström, 2018, p.289). In relation to this thesis the material might seem narrow in the sense \nthat it focuses on just two sites, 1177 Vårdguiden and UMO.se. However, since the theme on \ngender-neutral language is relatively new and the research is very limited, this analysis which \nis narrowed to Swedish medical and healthcare texts to see how it might be constructed, still \nseems to be enough. Another issue to keep in mind is the relationship between the author and \nthe discourse, what their position is in regard to the theme and material. In this case it is \nimportant to keep in mind that different authors may get other results from an analysis of the \nmaterial than this one, depending on who they are and their relationship to the discourse.  \n \nWhen it comes to the chosen material from 1177 Vårdguiden and UMO.se, this as well might \nbe considered flawed in some ways. Even though the collected material is relevant for the posed \nquestions, it can be seen as deficient to the extent that the sites texts are fairly similar to each \nother due to the fact that they have a certain amount of cooperation regarding both the text \nstructure and linguistic rules. However, this might also be a strength as it enables to see whether \narticles, despite the same rules, differs in their sentence structures and in their usage of a gender-\nneutral language and terms. Another strength in the material lies in the fact that the information \non the site’s reaches out to a lot of individuals and is easily accessible. Which possibly makes \n   \n \n17 \nthe language more elaborate and neutral than perhaps the language that less public sites may \nuse. However, by focusing on the Swedish context this material might not give an overview in \ngeneral, but rather a smaller close-up of the phenomenon. But, as said above, it is sufficient \nsince the research on gender-neutral language is still very limited.  \n   \n \n18 \n4. Results \nWith regard to the initial research questions for the thesis: How is gender neutral language \nconstructed in medical and healthcare texts, in regard to how different gender identities and \npronouns are presented? It is inclusive or not and in what way?, and the choice to use discourse \nanalysis to examine how a gender-neutral language is constructed in the chosen material, \nqualitative discourse analysis was performed. The collected material is analysed through three \nmain themes; representation of the gender binary, representation of the non-binary genders and \npronouns and general structure-neutral, inclusive or neither. This is followed by a comparison \nof the two sites 1177 Vårdguiden and UMO.se to look at the differences and similarities \nbetween them.   \n \n \n4.1 Representation of the gender binary \n4.1.1 1177 Vårdguiden \nWhile the site is leaning towards a language with a norm critical view to make the texts more \ninclusive and not point out some things as “normal” or “non-normal\", usage of binary terms \nman and woman (or boy/girl), female and male, female/woman- and male/man bodies are still \npresent in some of the articles. Such usage of terms is motivated by the fact that as many readers \nas possible should be able to understand and consume what is written (1177 Vårdguiden, \n2019b). \n \nFor example, the terms mentioned above, are frequently used in the article about puberty where \nthe site refers to the fact that “Girls usually reach puberty earlier than boys” (1177 Vårdguiden, \n2018) in relation to the fact that girl bodies and boy bodies enters puberty at different ages and \nevolves differently. Examples of such practices in the texts are the description of how girl \nbodies often get wider hips, boy bodies broader shoulders, girl bodies get stretch marks on the \nthighs and breasts, while boys get them on the back and shoulders, girls’ voices change less \nthan boys do in the puberty voice change and how boys might also have a beard growth. One \nsentence in the specific article that displays this is the following: “...this is what is usually called \n   \n \n19 \npuberty voice change. It happens to both boys and girls. But boys’ voices change more than \ngirls...” (ibid.).  \n \nThere is also another usage of these terms in relation to gender identity where an example is \ngiven on how someone might have a male identity but was assigned the female gender at birth \n(1177 Vårdguiden, 2021c). Here there is a dialogue on what it means to identify with a gender \nidentity outside the norm of female and male and therefore begs the question on what is meant \nby female gender or male gender since there is no definition on it. For example, the article cites \nthat someone who is a cisperson (someone who identifies with their assigned birth gender) may \n“feel like a man, are male according to the population register and have a body that looks like \na male body is expected to do.” (ibid.). Or how a transexual person might be female to male in \nthe sense that one feel like a man but was assigned the female gender at birth, which is a \ndifferent usage of the word man than the one of boy in the puberty article. In the former the \nterms are used in a way that refers to the anatomy and appearance of the body while in the latter \nit more refers to the feeling of oneself in combination with the appearance. The question here \nis whether it is meant to reference the anatomy as well, or if boy in the puberty text and the \nusage here are two different concepts.  \n \nHowever, just like 1177 Vårdguiden have a motivation for the usage of such terms, there is also \na definition behind them which can be found in an article of their own or in a definition box at \nthe bottom of articles that use them. The following definition is made of the term's woman and \nman: “When we write the word woman, the word is used to describe someone who has what is \nusually considered a female body. When we write the word man, the word is used to describe \nsomeone who has what is usually considered a male body” (1177 Vårdguiden, 2017). While \nthis explanation makes it clear that the terms refer to bodies, there is no explanation to what a \nfemale or male body are. Rather by constructing sentences in such a way that describes both \nthe changing anatomy and bodily appearance during puberty, but also the feeling of gender it \nleaves it open for readers to define what man, woman, female body and male body really means \nand what it relates to in the articles. Thus, this very open definition plays into the reproduction \nof the gender norms that the texts are supposed to criticizes and challenge. This is because the \nframing of words depicts a difference between bodies that conforms with the heteronormative \nand performative view and thinking of genders as only two. \n   \n \n20 \n  \n4.1.2 UMO.se \nThe language in the texts on UMO.se is based on a norm critical view and therefore questions \nthe norms that affect a person’s way of living as they want. Hence the texts are structured in a \nway that avoids reproduction of such social norms, and is based on their linguistic rules (UMO, \nn.d.C,G). However, gender binary terms like girl, boy, girl- and boy body are frequently used \nin the texts, even when it is not necessary, which kind of goes against the linguistic \nrecommendations.  \n \nOne primary example of this emerges in the structure of the text about puberty. This text is built \non the use of sentences such as “On girl bodies the first sign that you are in puberty...” and \n“...many boy bodies also get enlarged mammary glands...” (UMO, n.d.A) when describing \ndifferences between the bodily development during puberty. It also refers to girl- and boy \nbodies in how girls might get wider hips and boys’ broader shoulders and how “...boy voices \nchange more than girl voices...” (ibid.). When using these gender binary terms, the site \nmotivates it by writing that as many people should be able to understand the text and when \nwriting girl or boy it refers to what is typically seen as a girl- or boy body. It also makes clear \non the fact that “Having a biological boy body as a boy and a biological girl body as a girl...” \n(UMO, n.d.H) might not apply for everyone. However, these deceptions and motivations does \nnot explain what it is meant by writing boy- or girl voices, since voices does not have a relation \nto the anatomy of the body.  \n \nThe text explaining what equality is (UMO, n.d.H) also uses the terms girl and boy very often \nwhile describing the concept of equality. Here equality is defined as a notion that makes it \npossible for the genders girl and boy to have the same rights in different aspects of societal life. \nThis of course makes sense, since there is a gap between the status of genders boy and girl when \nit comes to work, money, crime and so on. Nonetheless the text also brings up issues when it \ncomes to care, discrimination and opportunities in school, which is said to apply for everyone; \n“Schools must work for gender equality and for all students to have the opportunity to be who \nthey want to be, without being guided by gender” (UMO, n.d.H). The issue here is that even \n   \n \n21 \nthough this includes everyone, the texts still only bring up the equality problems between the \nbinary genders which excludes other genders that also falls into categories of inequality.  \n \n \n4.2 Representation of the non-binary and pronouns \n4.2.1 1177 Vårdguiden \nWhen it comes to gender identities and pronouns outside the gender norm the term hen is the \nmost significant one. While some articles use, as mentioned above, man/woman to point out \ndifferences between bodies, most texts are written in the perspective of the reader. This means \nthat a majority of the focused articles use terms as “person”, “you”, “your” and “those” in \nreference to individuals, which makes the language rather gender-neutral and exclusive, not \ninclusive, which can be both negative and positive. The only frequent usage of gender-inclusive \nterms lies in the usage of hen when the articles refer to a third person. For example, sentences \nlike “On the weekends it is good if hen can sleep longer in the mornings” (1177 Vårdguiden, \n2019a) are used in the article “Teenagers 13-18 years” where the aim is to help parents (or other \nguardians) navigate their teenagers world. There are quite a few similar sentences to be found \nin other texts too, but only in relation to a third person or in the definition of what a pronoun is.  \n \nApart from that the articles are, as said, more gender-neutral in their explanations by being \nwritten in the readers’ perspective. The article about menstruation, which relates to a specific \nanatomy, are also very neutral in its language construction in way that the text never mentions \na specific gender and only refers to a person. Two examples on the text’s construction are: \n“How much you bleed, the number of bleeding days and the number of days between bleeding \nvary from person to person” or “As long as you have menstruation every month, it is possible \nto get pregnant and have children” (1177 Vårdguiden, 2021a). Although it might seem like \nnothing, the fact is that there is no mentions of the word woman or female anywhere in the text, \nwhich makes it more inclusive to individuals with vaginas who might not identify with the \nfemale gender. There is also a section which is specifically aimed at those who feel discomfort \nand gender dysphoria when they have their periods. Likewise, there are parts of the puberty \ntexts that do not mention specific genders and instead refers to those with specific bodily \n   \n \n22 \nanatomy; “In those who have a penis...” and “In those who have a vagina...” (1177 \nVårdguiden, 2018) are both examples of this.  \n \nAs said earlier, different gender identities outside the norm do not really appear in the articles, \nexcept for when there is a given definition on what non-binary are; “Non-binary describes a \nperson who neither identifies as male nor female, or sometimes both and or no gender at all. \nThe word can mean different thing to different people. Other words that can mean about the \nsame thing are for example agender, intergender and genderqueer” (1177 Vårdguiden, \n2021c). Although the explanation itself is correct, the way that other identities are framed make \nit seem like they are not as real and significant as the non-binary identities.   \n \n4.2.2 UMO.se \nWhen reading the texts on UMO.se one can easily see that there is a lack in usage of both the \npronoun hen and different gender identities. Since the texts are written in the readers perceptive, \nthe language is instead constructed of terms like “people”, “they” and “you” and is therefore \nmore gender-neutral instead of being both neutral and inclusive. For instance, menstruations \nare described as phenomena that varies from person to person and are not limited to a specific \ngender; “Menstruation is the body’s way of showing that you are sexually mature” (UMO, \nn.d.D). Yet there are aspects of the texts which can be perceived as targeting a specific gender, \ndepending on who the reader is. Sentences as “Most friends may have already received it and \nyou feel relieved that you are finally one in the “gang”” (ibid.), can be harmful for individuals \nwho have periods but do not identify with the expectant gender of female, which the text \ninsinuates by writing one in the gang. This is because one’s period often starts in the teenage \nyears, where peer groups often are divided between the binary genders and where those \nexpected to have their period often hang out with each other. By writing one in the gang, it \ninvalidates those individuals who might also get their period but does not fall into the same \nexpected gender category.  \n \nOther texts are very neutral or anonymous in their construction but lacking the usage and \ndescription of what other genders than girl and boy might be. When writing about gender \nidentity there is mention on how someone might identify with something outside the gender \n   \n \n23 \nbinary on multiple occasions; “Which gender you know yourself as is usually called gender \nidentity. It could be that you feel like a guy, a girl, both, or none of it.” (UMO, n.d.F). Besides \nfragments similar to this, examples on what other identities might be are never given, which is \nvery excluding considering the site is supposed to be norm critical and inclusive.  \n \nAnother illustration of this is found in the text about how one’s gender does not define who you \nare (UMO, n.d.B). Here a discussion is made on the social norms and invisible rules that one is \nexpected to follow, but how in reality everyone should be whoever they want. Hence, the texts \nwork from the norm to display the arguments through sentences as “...if you are a guy and \ndress as girls usually do, or if you are a girl and dress as boys usually do...” and “A thing that \nis seen as girly in one place, can be seen as boyish elsewhere” (ibid.). While it is understandable \nwhy they are structured like this, it also makes it seem like the gender binary are the only \nvalidated genders, since there is no mention of other identities through the whole text. This is \nreinforced by the fact that other parts of the text, which seem neutral at first in the way that it \nis written how no one gets to be treated badly because of their identity (if its boy, girl or other), \nalso lack examples of other genders and still refers to boy/boyish or girl/girly. Additionally, \nthere is no description of what is meant by girl or boy clothes, which is discussed further in \nsection (4.3.2).  \n \n \n4.3 General language structure- neutral, inclusive or neither \n4.3.1 1177 Vårdguiden \nIn its entirety 1177 Vårdguiden uses a very neutral, but exclusive, language rather than \ninclusive. This does not necessarily mean something negative, but it might indicate that the \nconstruction of language needs a little more work to become even further neutral or inclusive. \nMany of the texts are currently composed of sentences, which combines a neutral and \nexclusionary language, instead of being neutral or inclusive in its entirety. Like the article about \npuberty (1177 Vårdguiden, 2018), where even though there is a frequent use of terms related to \nthe gender binary, this usage is combined with neutral language as well. Some parts of the text \nuse binary terms in relation to what happens during puberty such as “The mammary glands are \noften enlarged on male bodies as well” (1177 Vårdguiden, 2018), to then switch to a neutral \n   \n \n24 \nlanguage in the section after, as the example with the genitals. Only for it to switch back once \nagain to a more exclusive language in the following section by writing things as “When the \ntesticles begin to grow, it is a sign that a boy’s body is in puberty” (ibid.). Except from some \nparts in articles that are constructed in this manner, the language is very neutral and careful in \na way where the authors try to use neutral language and try to not indicate that it concerns a \nspecific gender but only you or a person. While this is positive, the usage of some terms can \nstill be problematic and can in fact easily be replaced by other words than the ones used in the \ntext. For instance, the structure and inclusiveness of the texts would change a lot just by \nreplacing words like boy and girl body with the anatomy instead, or just specify that the \nanatomy is what it refers to, like they do in the article about menstruation.  \n \n4.3.2 UMO.se \nIn UMO.se text about the norm-critical perspective they use, three standpoints (amongst others) \nare addressed: to question norms, avoid reproduction of norms and shed a light on both \nindividuals and groups within and outside the norm (UMO, n.d.C). An overview of UMO.se \nmake it clear that they are trying to be as neutral and norm critical as possible in their texts, but \nthe current structure has its flaws as it is slightly disorganized and switches between a neutral \nand exclusionary language. Examples of such practices can be found in one of the texts on \nsexual orientation and gender identity, where trans and cis is explained. Here the texts are \nwritten with a neutral language structure in full when describing how all individuals may feel \ndifferent about their gender and what trans and genders mean. However, problematic sentences \ncan be identified, for example; “It can also be about you being a guy but like to wear typical \ngirl clothes” or “But you feel good about dressing in clothes that are seen as typical of another \ngender...” (ibid.). Unlike the use of the term girl and boy, which at least provides definitions to \nthem, terms like typical girl clothes, boy/girl voices and girly/boyish leaves it up to the reader \nto decide what is defined to be girl clothes or what a boy voice are. Hence it plays part in the \nrecreation of the norms and gender binary since it assumes that people define and categorize \ngenders in different ways and already have a vision of what girl, boy or gender typical clothes \nmight be.  \n \n   \n \n25 \nAnother point is that the terms of boy or girl, or similar binary terms, are sometimes used in \nparts where they are not necessary. While writing how gender does not define you and are \nallowed to be whom you want sentences as “Many feel freer and happier when they dare to \nbreak invisible rules for how you should be as a girl or boy” (UMO n.d.B) are found. Or when \ntalking about invisible rules for sex “When it comes to sex, there are also things that are seen \nas girly or boyish” (ibid.). The text is supposed to include everyone, regardless of gender so \nwhy use sentences as these when they can easily be rewritten into something more neutral? \nEspecially the part on sex since the invisible rules themselves are written in a gender-neutral \nlanguage. Just by changing the terms girl and boy to `a specific gender´ would make it more \ninclusive and neutral. Just further up in the text there are examples of such neutral language \nwhere they refer to that children may be treated differently depending on which genitals they \nhave: “Those who have a vagina may be praised when they are calm and sweet. Those who \nhave a penis may be praised when they are active and tough” (ibid.). They do not reference a \nspecific gender in regard to it being a boy or girl, they simply just point to those who may have \nspecific genitals.   \n \n \n4.4 Comparison of the sites \nSince the sites share linguistic rules and at times reference each other in articles, it is interesting \nto compare them and see if the language structure and usage of terms differs between the two. \nAfter reading similar texts from both sites one can easily see that there are both similarities and \ndifferences in the way they have chosen to structure the language. For instance, both sites, as \nwritten above, use a more gender-neutral rather than neutral and inclusive language. This is \ndefined by sentences written from the perspective of the reader, where terms as “person”, \n“those”, “you” and so on are used instead of different gendered terms. A difference in their \nwriting is, however, that 1177 Vårdguiden uses hen more frequently and in boarder context \nthan UMO.se does. While the former uses it in relation to third persons UMO.se only mention \nit a few times, mainly when giving suggestions on pronouns.  \n \nAnother similarity between them is that some sentences and whole parts of texts are the same, \nwhich means that the collaboration between sites are relatively considerable. One example can \nbe found in their texts on puberty where parts on how the genitals change are identical and 1177 \n   \n \n26 \nVårdguiden even has a clickable to UMO.se in their version of the section. There are also \nsections where the texts only have changed a little between them, like the parts on the voice \nchange. While 1177 Vårdguiden writes “It happens to both boys and girls. But boys’ voices \nchange more than girls...” (1177 Vårdguiden, 2018), UMO.se writes “It happens regardless of \nyour gender. Boy voices change more than girl voices” (UMO, n.d.A). Just these short quotes \npoint to that while 1177 Vårdguiden might have a more gender-neutral language structure in \nsome parts, UMO.se can have it at other times.  \n \nEven though they are based on the same conditions and rules, these differences between them \nmight be to the fact that UMO.se focuses on information to younger individuals while 1177 \nVårdguiden articles is aimed for the general public. The formers’ structure is more user-friendly \nand use a very simple language while the latter’s structure is stricter and more factual.  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n27 \n5. Analysis and Conclusions \nThe results display that the language structure is rather gender-neutral in the material on most \noccasions, however it is more of an exclusionary language than inclusive at various levels. In \nthis chapter an analysis and discussion on what this means in regard to the theories and previous \nresearch on the problem are presented. What the thesis contributes to the research and how this \nresearch can be developed are also discussed.  \n \nAs seen in previous research, the perception and attitudes towards genders outside the binary \nhave started to transform into something more inclusive, but the non-binary genders are still \ndependent on the society to recognize them. Hence, a specific social change is not entirely \npossible yet, which results in the fact that identifying with a non-binary gender can be highly \nchallenging because the discrimination and exclusion one may face (West & Zimmerman, \n1987; Darwin, 2017). Among the reasons for current social perception of gender, as mentioned \nin previous research (Nicholas, 2019), lays the fact that there is not enough knowledge about \nidentities outside the norm within social structures. Therefore, researcher (Matsuno & Budge, \n2017; Monro, 2019) suggest making attempts to change the attitudes and perception from within \nthe structures for example by encourage the use of gender-neutral and inclusive language. Other \nresearch (Senden et al, 2015, 2021; Jetubhai & Ghosal, 2019) has shown how gender-neutral \nterms may change attitudes and usage for the better and how using a gender-neutral language \nmight result in different mindsets. There are still a few gaps in knowledge to fill, for instance \nhow such a language might be structured and how gender-inclusive terms are presented which \nis what this thesis have done by looking at Swedish healthcare texts.  \n \nWhen looking at the results of this thesis, one major problem with the current language is that \nit lacks explanations for certain terms, which allows readers to develop their own individual \ndefinitions. These terms, such as man/boy body, woman/girl body, girly and boyish, are those \nwho display the norm of the gender-binary and the way they are used may be explained by the \nconcept of performativity (Butler, 2011; Butler et al., 2005) and heteronormativity (Butler et \nal., 2005; Butler, 2007). The concept of performativity is that gender is not made until it is \nassigned to someone, which the material plays onto to by using terms as girly and boyish which \ndoes not exist without it being made (Butler, 2011; Butler et al., 2005). However, it might be \n   \n \n28 \ndone unintentionally in the material since the aim is to be gender-neutral and inclusive, but the \ntheory builds on the fact that everyone actively links to the gender order (female and male) even \nif it is unintentionally. This is why the language detected in the material is based on norms that \ndistinguish genders from other genders. Performativity also builds on how normative \nperceptions are maintained by the way a language is used. By not defining words the material \nrecreates those normative thoughts since readers base their interpretation of girly and boyish on \ntheir own perception of gender which still often are norm based.  \n \nThe discussions about being a girl or boy, how they act in a certain way and get divided into \ntwo different categories are also enhanced by the heteronormative view. Hence, the notions of \nmasculine=manly=man or femininity=female=woman are addressed in the material without \ncontext. Rather it is based on the fact that readers know what it means, thus that the norm is to \nbe female or male. Although the texts make it clear that everyone can be whoever they want, \nthe way it is framed makes it sound genders outside of the binary are non-normative. Which is \nwhat the material is supposed to contradict in accordance with their norm-critical perspective. \nIt is thus constituted by the heteronormativity (Butler et al., 2005, Butler, 2007) that prevails in \nsociety. But since heteronormativity suggest that gender is socially created it also means that \nthere is a way to make resistance of this making of gender by acting in a non-normative way. \nThat is something that the texts might do if the structure of the current gender-neutral language \nchanges a bit towards a more inclusive one.  \n \nTo sum it up, the material might be constructed the way it is, with the usage of neutral- and \ngendered terms and exclusion of differences, because the writers behind the texts are humans \nwhich live in the social context where intersectionality (Dahl, 2005; Lykke, 2005; de los Reyes \n& Mulinari, 2010), the relation between genders and heteronormativity, still builds on a \nperspective where individuals outside the norm are undermined those within it. In other words, \nit plays on the “we” and “them” perspective even though it might be unconsciously. If this \nperspective were to change, the structure of the language could also have the opportunity to \nchange, since intersectionality is based on the superiority and subordination within different \nsocial positions. Hence, that the social structures behind the categorization changes. (Molina \nVega et al., 2003; de los Reyes & Mulinari, 2010). It is thus about the biopower (Foucault, \n2002) related to the norms humans and groups built where, for example, one talk about genders \n   \n \n29 \nin different ways and how one relates to the norm. For the language to be able to transform into \na more inclusive and neutral this biopower also needs to be reconstructed, which is done by \npeople. The structure of a gender-neutral language can thus be thought to be complicated and \nis affected by whether people react to it or not, if they recreate it or not. But both biopower and \nintersectionality suggest that social structures can change (ibid.; de los Reyes et al., 2005), as \nmore and more people become open for inclusiveness of other genders and thereafter, pronouns. \nBy looking at the results of the thesis one can say that this might be done slowly but surely \nsince there is a start in what a gender-neutral language can look like. This gender-neutral \nlanguage, that 1177 Vårdguiden and UMO.se uses, reaches many people who might embrace \nthese gender-neutral terms of the language for further usage and acceptance outside the \nhealthcare sites. Which, depending on the reaction of the language, in turn might result in a \nslow change of social structures.  \n \nGender-neutral language and its use is relativity new if one looks at the limited studies on the \ntopic, which means that its structure and impact can be further developed and explored. Even \nthough this paper examines what an existing gender-neutral language looks like, there are still \nimprovements to be done with the structure for the language to become even better, this in \ncombination with more studies on it. For example, based on the research findings from this \nthesis, a suggestion is that the authors of the medical texts, or similar texts, should rephrase \nsentences so that a definition of what boy/man or girl/woman are, is solely based on the \nanatomy. This should also be done in the texts by referring to a kind of anatomy instead of \nwriting female/male body. For the language to further become more neutral and inclusive \nsomething needs to change on a structural social level, but considering that it is relatively new \nthe way it is are a good start.  \n \nThe way the gender-neutral language are constructed in the Swedish medical and healthcare \ncontext, its lack of inclusiveness and so on, are also relevant findings for the EU. If Sweden, \nwhich is supposed to be one of the most gender advanced countries as mentioned before, still \nhas a lot of development ahead of it before they are considered to have a “perfect” gender-\nneutral and inclusive language, then what about the rest of Europe? Even though the European \nCommission launched “The LGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2020-2025” (COM(2020)698) in 2020, \nwhere the usage of a gender-inclusive language are mentioned, there is clearly still, in relation \n   \n \n30 \nto this thesis research findings in the Swedish context, a lot of work to be done in regard to the \nusage and structure. This does not mean that the rest of EU cannot lean on the findings from \nthe Swedish context, since their current language can be used as a starting point to develop a \ngeneral gender-neutral language from. Although for the EU and its member states to be able to \ndevelop the language further both Sweden and the EU must change and develop more in terms \nof social structures and acceptance of differences. The question is thus what can further be done \nby the EU to change the current social situations in the member states? This is something that \nneeds to be explored and discussed both in research and within the EU. \n \nFurthermore, since this thesis is focused on a Swedish delimitation with a medical and \nhealthcare view point, it would be legitimate in future research to explore other EU members \nstates as well. This to see if they have similar structures, or even has a gender-neutral language. \nMerely because the Swedish material uses a somewhat gender-neutral language does not mean \nthat other countries use one or it might not have the same structure. It all depends on what \ndifferent language glossary’s looks like in terms of gender and the social context that the \nlanguage exists in. Research should also focus on exploring how individuals perceives the \ngender-neutral language and the effects of it, both for the binary and non-binary gender \nidentities. Perhaps through field studies over a certain period of time, which maybe focuses on \nfollowing non-binary individuals in their everyday life to see how they are approached by others \nand how they perceive it.  \n \n \n   \n \n31 \nSources and bibliography  \nArticles: \nDarwin, Helana (2017) “Doing Gender Beyond the Binary: A Virtual Ethnography”. \nSymbolic interaction, 40(3), 317-334.

    "abstract": "The visibility of individuals who advocate for and identify with genders outside the genderbinary\nhas risen during recent years, but these individuals still face discrimination in many\nways. With regard to this the European Commission launched a strategy in 2020 with focus on\nequal rights for LGBTIQ individuals with an indication that healthcare and gender-inclusive\nlanguage are pivotal areas for strengthening equality and representation. Therefore, this thesis\nis aimed to examine the structure of gender-neutral language in medical and healthcare contexts,\nin regard to how different gender identities and pronouns are represented. Whether it is\ninclusive or not. With a delimitation to Sweden this was done through a qualitative discoursebased\ntext analysis of ten articles from the healthcare sites 1177 Vårdguiden and UMO.se.\nSeveral theories from gender studies were applied to explain the current structure and\ncomposition of the gender-neutral language used in the articles. The result indicates that a\ngender-neutral language currently exists to the extant where neutral concepts as “person”,\n“your” and similar are used. However, it is not particularly inclusive regarding usage of\ndifferent identities and pronouns",
