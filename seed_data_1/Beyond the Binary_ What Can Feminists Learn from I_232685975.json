BEYOND THE BINARY: WHAT CAN FEMINISTSLEARN FROM INTERSEX AND TRANSGENDERJURISPRUDENCE?_7-ulie Greenberg*uA'aybeth I-Ierald\"c544ark Strasser*JULIE GREENBERG: Our panel will be discussing recent devel-opments in the intersex and transsexual communities. The transsexualcommunity began to organize in the 1970s, but did not fully developinto a vibrant movement until the 1990s. The intersex movement wasborn in the mid-1990s and has rapidly developed a strong and influen-tial voice. Recently, both movements have undergone profound changesand each has provided new and unique theoretical perspectives that canpotentially benefit other social justice groups. The purpose of our dia-logue today is to describe these developments and explore how feministscould potentially benefit from the theoretical frameworks that are beingadvanced by the intersex and transsexual communities.Before we begin our discussion, I want to provide a brief summaryof the terminology we will be using. When we refer to a person with anintersex condition or a disorder of sex development (DSD), we will bediscussing a person whose reproductive or sexual anatomy is not allclearly male or clearly female. When we use the word transsexual, we arereferring to a person whose reproductive system and sexual anatomy donot match the person's self-identified gender.It is impossible to cover all the recent developments in both move-ments. In our limited time, we will focus primarily on developments inthe transsexual community, but I will start by summarizing recent de-velopments in the intersex movement. Although the intersex movementis in its infancy, during the past few years, the movement has accom-plished some of its primary goals and has undergone some dramaticshifts in its focus.When the intersex movement began, it followed the model ofmany other social justice identity movements. For example, just as othersocial justice movements chose to reclaim and recharacterize pejorativeterms, such as the word \"queer,\"~ that had be en used against them, theIntersex Society of North America (ISNA) published a newsletter, titledProfessor of Law, Thomas Jefferson School of Law.Professor of Law, Thomas Jefferson School of Law.**Trustees Professor of Law, Capital University Law School, Columbus, Ohio.1314 MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAW [V.173\"Hermaphrodites with Attitude.\"' The group sought to end the shameand secrecy surrounding the birth of a child with an intersex conditionand develop a support network for these children and their families. Theintersex movement approached other organizations that it believedwould share common concerns and goals. It associated closely with gayand AIDS activist groups and adopted some of their tactics, includingstaging protests at medical gatherings. It also viewed itself as a logicalprogression in the evolution of civil rights struggles by feminists, gaysand lesbians, and transsexuals, and acknowledged the beneficial paths2that had been forged by the transsexual movement.Recently, many in the intersex movement have shifted away froman identity politics model. Although the early movement closely allieditself with the LGBT community, many intersex activists have distancedthemselves from LGBT politics and have started utilizing a disability-rights framework. Transsexuals, on the other hand, are closely allied withgays, lesbians, and bisexuals; most major gay and lesbian organizationshave added \"T\" to their acronym and are including transsexual concernson their agendas.Some of you may be questioning the relevance of including thistopic at a feminist legal theory conference. I believe that feminists canbenefit from examining the development of the different movementsand the alliances and rifts that have occurred among the various organi-zations. One would think that close alliances and working relationshipswould have developed among people who have focused their energies onending discrimination based on sex, gender, sexual orientation, andgender identity. Unfortunately, dissention has developed among thevarious groups. Some disagreements are a part of our history and havebeen effectively resolved, but many of these disputes have not been suc-cessfully addressed and new divisions are developing.One current concern is that the various communities do not sharecommon goals and some fear that forming alliances among the variousgroups may be counterproductive. Some activists believe that althoughsex, gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity concerns overlap, thedifferent movements have distinct and sometimes incompatible goals. Ibelieve that these diverse movements, including feminists, can learnabout more effective ways to frame their issues and agendas by examin-1.

The feminist movement was a white, upper-class, hetero-sexual movement. Lesbians were referred to as the purple menace andleading feminists distanced themselves from lesbians and their issues.These feminists were concerned that incorporating lesbians into themovement would lead to societal rejection of all feminist concerns be-cause of the homophobia that was prevalent at this time. Eventually,lesbian activists were able to successfully reframe the vision of a feministto put lesbian concerns front and center. Women who loved otherwomen were seen as more female than women who desired sex withmen. Currently, many key positions in feminist organizations are heldby lesbians and the lesbian agenda is a critical part of the feminist3movement.Many second-wave feminists were even more opposed to the inclu-sion of transsexuals than they were to incorporating lesbians into thewomen's movement. This aversion to including transsexuals in somefemale spaces still exists. Three justifications for excluding transsexualsand their concerns have been raised. First, some feminists have assertedthat male-to-female transsexuals should be excluded from feministgroups because they are not true women and they continue to exercisethe power associated with their male privileged upbringing. Second,some feminists have argued that female-to-male transsexuals should beexcluded because they have rejected their womanhood to gain the ad-vantages awarded to men in our patriarchal system. Finally, andprobably most important, some feminists have maintained that trans-sexuals buy into essentialist notions of sex and gender andinappropriately seek to cross the gender divide rather than deconstruct. 4it.One prominent example of this rejection occurred at the MichiganWomyn's Music Festival (MWMF), one of the largest annual socialgatherings of women. Women forcefully ejected a ma-le-to-female trans-sexual attendee when she identified herself in a workshop as atransgender woman. MWTMF then adopted a \"womyn-born-womyn'policy. Although MW(MvF has deleted this reference in its current3.

Daughters of second-wave feminists were typicallytaught that gender would not play a role in determining their futuresuccess. Therefore, some younger women find it difficult to relate tosomeone who would want to transition to the opposite sex. They ques-tion how anyone could assign gender such critical importance that itwould become the defining feature of the person's identity.Many feminist activists have moved away from the original outrightrejection of transsexuals. Some feminists, however, still fail to under-stand transsexual concerns and transsexuals are far from fullyincorporated into the feminist movement.Divisions have also arisen between lesbians and transsexuals. Al-though transsexuals were on the front lines at Stonewall in 1969, as thegay and lesbian movement developed, transsexuals and their issues weremarginalized or completely rejected. During the 1970s and 1980s,transsexual concerns rarely appeared in LGB organizations' missionstatements. Many gays and lesbians viewed transsexuals' claims as valid,but unconnected to the gay and lesbian movement. They did not under-stand the connection between gay and transsexual rights and believedthat trying to combine the two diverse issues would lead to a loss of fo-cus and effectiveness.6In contrast, most transsexuals believe that the movements are in-separable. First, a large number of transsexuals also identify as lesbian,gay or bisexual. More importantly, they recognize that homophobia andtransphobia are closely linked and that bias and violence against bothgroups is motivated by animosity towards those who transgress gender7norms.This issue came to a head in 2007 when Congress was consideringpassing the Employment Nondiscrimination Act (ENDA), a law thatwould prohibit discrimination based upon sexual orientation. Theoriginal version of the bill also prohibited discrimination based upongender identity and expression. When it appeared that a transgender5.

Id16 ol. 17:13inclusive ENDA would not pass, Barney Frank proposed a bill that de-leted the \"gender identity and expression\" language. All the majorLGBT organizations, except the Human Rights Campaign, joined forcesto oppose the new version. They united together to oppose the passageof any bill that protected gays and lesbians, but not transsexuals. Thisunited stand was a watershed moment in the incorporation of transsex-ual concerns in the gay and lesbian agenda.'The intersex and feminist movements have also been at logger-heads. During the early years of the intersex movement, feministviewpoints about the social construction of gender resonated with manyintersex persons. Feminist theory provided a supportive framework forpeople whose gender identity did not conform to the sex assigned tothem at birth, as well as those who had developed an intersex identity. Italso helped many intersex persons understand how their medical treat-ment had been based on societal assumptions about appropriategenitalia and gender roles.The intersex movement met rejection from feminists who workedto oppose female genital cutting (FGC) as it is practiced in non-westerncountries. Although the reasons for opposing genital surgery on intersexinfants are similar to the arguments made by feminists opposed to FGC,anti-FGC feminists have failed to include surgeries on intersex infantson their agendas. Surgeries on intersex infants and FGC often result inalmost identical physical harms. In addition, they are both medicallyunnecessary and are performed without the informed consent of thepatient. Most important, just as FGC is used to reinforce gender norms,one of the goals of intersex surgeries is to reinforce heterosexism andcultural norms of appropriate gender roles.Intersex activists believe that anti-FGC feminists should recognizethe parallels between the harmful practices of FGC and genital surgeryperformed on intersex infants. They have asked anti-FGC feministgroups to help them convince legislatures to include infant intersexgenital surgeries within the ban on FGC. Despite the similarities be-tween the surgeries, their negative physical and psychological effects,and the patriarchal heterosexist norms that support both practices, anti-FGC feminists have excluded intersex concerns from their agenda. Thusfar, western feminist organizations that oppose FGC have refused tocriticize western doctors who perform surgery on intersex infants.Although intersex activist organizations have attempted to form an alli-ance with anti-FCC feminists, these overtures have been rejected.!8.

Some in the intersex movement believe that theprimary goal should be to end surgeries on intersex infants. They believethat this goal is too far removed from the major goals of LGBT organi-zations. In addition, many intetsex activists are moving away from anidentity politics model and instead are framing their issues in terms ofdisability rights.As a final introductory comment, I believe one of the major lessonsthat feminists can learn from the intersex and transsexual movementsrelates to the advantages and disadvantages of working within a binarysex model. An important question that feminists need to address iswhether gender rights are more effectively advanced by working withinthe binary or instead trying to dismantle our binary sex and gender sys-tem.MARYBETH HERALD: Government and private discriminationagainst transsexuals falls into at least two major areas: sex determinationand sex discrimination.Sex Determination: The government's determination of a person'slegal sex carries broad implications in our society and affects, amongother matters, marriage, child custody, and identity documents. For ex-ample, most states currently prohibit same-sex marriage. The label\"male\" prohibits a person from marrying another man and the femalemarker bars marriage to another woman. To determine whether a mar-riage is between a male and a female, however, requires the governmentto determine each person's sex. The issue of who is a male or a femaleseems self-evident to a lot of people- the \"I know it when I see it\" ap-proach. But appearances are deceiving. The scientific literature reveals amore complex model than outward physical characteristics disclose, orventuring below the surface, chromosomes indicate.'0 Rather, many dif-ferent factors play a role in determining male or female status. Most ofthe population has congruent factors that all point in the direction ofeither male or female, but a significant minority do not conform to themajority model.When the courts began addressing the question of a person's legalsex, they seemed confounded by the challenge. In the early cases consid-ering these issues, courts sometimes acknowledged the complexity butthen retreated to a simplistic solution: whatever it says on your birthcertificate, whatever the doctor decided at that time of birth, is one's sexSISTERH-OOD 126, 140-42 (Stanlie M. James & Claire C. Robertson eds., Universityof Illinois Press 2002).10. Julie A. Greenberg, Defining Male and Female: Intersexuality and the Collision BetweenLaw and Biology, 41 Aiuz. L. REv. 265 (1999).[ o . 17:1318for life.\"1 The court effectively ruled that when the ink dried on the birthcertificate, nothing could change it - not even if a person had genderreassignment surgery. Focusing on birth, even when subsequent historyrendered that event a questionable marker, provided a convenient tool toavoid defining male and female. After a time for reflection and thought,however, a more modern approach developed in Australia, New Zea-land, and Europe that permitted documents to reflect a change in sexunder some circumstances.\"2 But the theories allowing these changesleave the binary sex structure and heterosexual marriage undisturbed.Marriage is not the only area where one's legally determined sex willaffect important life events. Given our increasingly security conscioussociety, documents that verify your identity and carry personal informa-tion such as your age, sex, and even height and weight are increasinglyrequired. Whether your driver's license or passport identifies you as maleor female makes a difference if you are stopped for security at the airportor at a traffic light. Finally, one's sex determination will have implica-tions for housing, bathroom, and locker room use.In addition to sex determination issues, transsexuals face sex dis-crimination issues. Discrimination issues arise in employment, schools,housing, insurance, medical coverage, and hate crimes. We obviously,with our time limits, will be able to touch on only a few points. This topic11. In the early influential case of Corbett v. Corbet the English court considered a chal-lenge to the validity of a marriage between a postoperative male-to-female transsexualand a male. (1970) 2 All E.R. 33 (P.). The transsexual wife had male chromosomesQMY and at birth, genitals (a penis) and male gonads (testicles). The chromosomesremained unchanged at the time of trial, but the genitals and gonads had been al-tered. The court voided the marriage as an illegal same-sex marriage between twomales. The court decided that the sex assigned at birth was unchangeable, no matterthe current state of a person's genitalia or self-identity. Corbett, 2 All E.R. at 44-45.In Canada and Singapore, judges cited Corbett, denying any legal effect to medical al-terations of sex. C. (L.) v. C. (C.), [19921 10 O.R.3d 254 (Can.); Lim Ying v. HiokKian Ming Eric, [1992] 1 S.L.R. 184 (ruling that a person's legal sex is established atbirth and does not change based upon medical intervention). Moreover, the Euro-pean Court of Human Rights (ECHR) rejected challenges under the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights (European Convention), which found in its earlycases no rights violation when a country refused to allow post-operative transsexualsto marry in their self-identified gender role.

To illus-trate some of the difficulties that might arise for families where one ofthe adults is transsexual, we might consider the family of Thomas Be-atie.Thomas Beatie, who has written a book\"3 and appeared on Oprah,is a female-to-male transsexual who has given birth to two children sincetransitioning. At some point in time, it may be important to determinewhether he, his wife, and their two children are considered a family inthe eyes of the law. That may depend on whether he is viewed legally asmale or female.His amended birth certificate from Hawaii states that he is male.Further, the state where he and his family now live, Oregon, permitsbirth certificates to be amended, so it might seem that he of coursewould be viewed as male by Oregon law However, it should be notedthat those states permitting birth certificates to be modified differ aboutthe requirements that must be met before such a modification will bepermitted. An individual who meets the criteria for having his or herbirth certificate amended in one state might not have met the relevantcriteria in a different state, and that latter state might refuse to givecredit to the birth certificate amendment authorized by the former state.Even if a judge is tempted as a general matter to give credit to abirth certificate amendment from another state, she might be lesstempted in a case involving someone like Beatie. Basically, the courtwould have to decide whether to recognize the modification and treat asmale someone who had given birth to two children after having under-gone the relevant procedures.A judge with an essentialist view of the sexes might hesitate beforedeclaring that a man can give birth to a child. Indeed, historically, courtswould sometimes justify their refusal to permit a birth certificate modi-fication precisely because permitting such a change might create thepossibility that a man would be able to give birth to a child. On theirview, using a chromosome test was preferable. Chromosomes do notchange and the judge would not be in the position of declaring someonea man who had XX chromosomes and who had delivered a child. (Letus bracket for the moment that not all individuals have either XX or XYchromosomes.)It might be noted, however, that one can have an essentialist under-standing of the sexes without focusing on giving birth as a defining13. THOMAS BEATIE, LABOR OF LOVE: THE STORY OF ONE MAN'S EXTRAORDINARYPREGNANCY 161 (Sea] Press 2008).Vo . 17:1320characteristic. Beatie, for example, seems to have a binary view of thesexes and believes that one is either male or female, but he defines thesexes differently so that there is no contradiction in saying that a mancan give, birth.It might be tempting to think that once a state permits a change tothe sex marker on a birth certificate, that change would be applicable forall purposes. However, that has not been the view embraced by thestates. Rather, states have taken the position that an individual can beviewed as female for certain purposes and male for other purposes. Evenmore confusing, it may not be clear whether a person will be consideredmale or female for a particular purpose until the matter goes throughthe courts.Consider the case of J'Noel Ball and Marshall Gardiner.\"4 J'Noeltransitioned from male to female in Wisconsin and her Wisconsin birthcertificate was amended to reflect that change. J'Noel met Marshall.They began dating and eventually married. He had been informedabout her history prior to the marriage, so there could be no claim thathe had been defrauded into marrying her.The question before the Kansas Supreme Court was whether J'Noelwas a woman for purposes of the state marriage statute. If so, then hermarriage would be valid and she would be entitled to all of the benefitsdue to a widow whose husband had died intestate. However, if J'Noelwas viewed by the state as a man for purposes of marriage, then J'Noel'smarriage to Marshall would be viewed as void and of no legal effect.J'Noel would be a legal stranger to Marshall. She would not be entitledto receive any of his estate and the sole heir would be Marshall's es-tranged son. The Kansas Supreme Court held that J'Noel was a man forpurposes of the state's marriage law, amended birth certificate notwith-standing, and that therefore she was not Marshall's widow.An analogous issue arose in Texas.\"5 Christie Littleton, a post-operative, male-to-female transsexual, had met and eventually marriedJonathan Littleton after having informed him about her history. Again,there was no claim of fraud or misrepresentation. Christie's husband,Jonathan, had died, allegedly because of medical malpractice, and shewas suing his doctor for wrongful death.In this case, Christie had undergone sex reassignment surgery inTexas and, during the litigation, had had her birth certificate amendedin accord with Texas law. Here, the issue was whether Christie was a fe-male for purposes of the Texas marriage stature. If so, then her marriageto Jonathan was valid and she could pursue the wrongful death action.14. See In re Estate of Gardiner, 42 P.3d 120 (Kan. 2002).15. See Littleton v. Prange, 9 S.W.3d 223 (Tex. App. 1999).20101 BEYOND THE BINARY 2122 ~MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAW [V.173if not, then her marriage to Jonathan would be void and of no legal ef-fect and she would be precluded from pursuing this cause of actionbecause in the eyes of the law she would be a legal stranger to her hus-band of several years.Gardiner and Littleton involved scenarios where a post-operativetranssexual married someone who was not of her self-identified sex. Butan individual might marry someone of a different chromosomal sex andonly later realize that he or she is trangendered. Louisiana has a statutethat speaks to the conditions under which one's birth certificate can beamended. That law includes a provision regarding notification of thecurrent spouse, so Louisiana law recognizes that an individual might bemarried and then seek to have the sex marker of his or her birth certifi-cate amended. 16 Surprisingly, Louisiana law does not address theLitteton/ Gardiner scenario where a post-operative transsexual seeks tomarry someone not of his or her self-identified sex. The failure to ad-dress this possibility means that it will have to be litigated, e.g., in thecontext of a wrongful death case. Or, it may come up in the context of adivorce-one of the parties who, perhaps, has all of the property in hisor her name seeks to avoid a property division or being forced to payspousal support by claiming that the marriage was void ab initio becauseboth of the parties are of the same chromosomal sex. The marriagemight then be viewed as if it had never existed and the parties would belegal strangers to one another.Let us again consider Thomas Beatie and his family. Suppose forwhatever reason his marriage to his current spouse does not work outand one or the other files for divorce. One of the parties might challengethe validity of the marriage because they are of the same chromosomalsex. Were the court to find that the marriage was void and of no legaleffect, there would be a variety of questions that would have to be an-swered. Not only might property or spousal support be at issue but aseparate question would be whether each adult would be recognized ashaving a legal relationship to the children of the marriage. For example,as a general matter, a child born into a marriage is presumed to be thechild of each spouse. But if the marriage is viewed as a nullity, then Be-atie's partner might not be afforded that presumption.Certainly, some states have equitable doctrines whereby an individ-ual who has a de facto parental relationship will be recognized in law ashaving a relationship with those children. Further, there are other possi-bilities as well. In some states, a non-marital partner is permitted toestablish a parental relationship with his or her partner's child via a sec-16. See IA. REv. STAT. ANN. §40:62(B)(2001).ol. 17:1322ond parent adoption. However, part of the difficulty here is that itwould not be clear prospectively whether an adoption was necessary.Let us add an additional wrinkle. Suppose that Beatie's wife doesnot want to rely on the presumption of parenthood afforded to a spousewhen a child is born into a marriage. Because she has no biological con-nection to the children, she decides to adopt as a way of legallycementing her parental status. She avails herself of the stepparent adop-tion option. Here, there is no other adult (in addition to Beatie) whohas parental rights, Beatie consents, and the adoption is in the best in-terests of the child. But a separate question to be resolved in light ofstate law would be whether a stepparent adoption can be consideredvalid if the individual attempting to make use of that provision was notin fact a stepparent of the child. Thus, were the marriage declared voidab initio, then IBeatie's wife would not have been a stepparent and acourt would have to decide whether the adoption would be recognizedby the state.Needless to say, having courts decide whether a couple is married orwhether a parent-child relationship exists at the time of divorce or afterone of the parties has died is simply unacceptable. Such a system jeop-ardizes the reasonable expectations of all of the parties and creates unfairincentives. Consider how much it might be worth to an individual notto have the validity of his or her marriage or parent-child relationshipcontested. It would not be surprising if individuals would be quite will-ing to sacrifice spousal support or property to avoid rolling the dice tosee whether a court would recognize the validity of the marriage.JULIE GREENBERG: Marks comments also relate back to myinitial remarks about shifting alliances. I still remember in the late 1990swhen our local LGB bar association was one of the bar associations thatengaged in extraordinarily heated debates about whether to become anLGBT organization and include transsexual people and concerns in itsmission. Some gay and lesbian members spoke out vociferously againstinclusion, arguing that the issues that affect transsexuals, as opposed togays and lesbians, are different and they should not be included underthe same umbrella.Interestingly, it was at about this same time that the validity of mar-riages in which one of the spouses was a transsexual started to be litigated.In some of these cases, the transsexual spouse experienced some success, asopposed to the same-sex marriage cases, which at this time met with uni-versal failure. Suddenly, LGB organizations that were choosing to distancethemselves from transsexuals realized the marriage cases involving a trans-sexual spouse had the potential to advance the same-sex marriagemovement. If courts could understand that determining a person's legal20101 BEYOND THE BINARY 2324 MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAW [Vl173sex for purposes of marriage was not a simple straightforward proposi-tion, then the state justification for limiting marriage to one man andone woman is weakened. How can a state legally ban same-sex marriageif experts, courts, and society are unable to agree on the factors that de-termine whether someone is a male or a female? I think that thesedevelopments may have played a role in building the LGBT alliance. Itmay be a coincidence, but it is significant that the alliances grew at thepoint when the successful arguments being advanced by transsexual liti-gants could also be used by gays and lesbians challenging the mixed sexmarriage requirement.MLARK STRASSER: Well, just one more thing on this. Texas isone of the states that relies on chromosomes to determine the sex of anindividual, which is how we get the result in Littleton. But such a hold-ing does not permit Texas to restrict marriage to those who appear to bethe traditional different-sex couple. It turns out that some transsexualsare physically attracted to individuals of their self-identified sex. Accord-ing to Texas law, an individual with XX chromosomes can only marrysomeone with XY chromosomes, and an individual with XX' chromo-somes can only marry someone with XX chromosomes. Suppose, then,that a transsexual with XX' chromosomes undergoes gender reassignmentsurgery and so is indistinguishable from any other woman that onemight meet on the street. The only type of person that she could legallymarry in Texas would be another woman, i.e., someone with XX chro-mosomes. So, in Texas, we have individuals marrying who appear to besame-sex couples, because one of them has XX chromosomes and theother has XYX chromosomes. However, the marriage of the Littletonscould not be recognized because both of them had XX' chromosomes.MIARYBETH HERALD: A thread going through all the decisionsis a fear of same-sex marriage. In considering these cases, the courts seemconcerned about the effect of their decisions regarding transsexuals andimplications for the same-sex marriage debate generally. But the ironicconsequence for post-surgical transsexuals stuck with the label of theirsex assigned at birth is that the marriage partners that remain legallyavailable to them are persons of the same gender. Some courts, in theirwillingness to engage in cognitive distortions such as ignoring surgicalalterations, reach an anomalous result-condoning same-sex marriageswhen they are committed to a heterosexual norm. In Gardiner, the Kan-sas Supreme Court seemed to go even further by implying that theKansas statute precluded marriage for transexuals: \"The plain ordinarymeaning of 'persons of the opposite sex' contemplates a biological manol. 17:1324and a biological woman and not persons who are experiencing genderdysphoria.\" 7Obviously if same-sex marriage were lawful, these issues would dis-appear for transsexuals. As it remains a contentious social issue, it uniteslesbian and gay organizations with the transgender movement. The in-tersex movement is less sanguine about an alliance on the same-sexmarriage issue, however.JULIE GREENBERG: At this point, I think it would be helpful todiscuss what has happened in the marriage cases in which one of thespouses had an intersex condition. One of the reasons that I think thatsome intersex activists have concluded that it is better not to join forceswith the LGBT movement is the belief that persons with an intersexcondition can fly below the radar. In other words, they can marrywhomever they please and their marriages are unlikely to be successfullychallenged. Unfortunately, based on what has happened in the marriagecases involving a transsexual spouse and the two reported cases in whichone of the spouses had an intersex condition, I believe that this assump-tion may be proven wrong.\\When I first started writing in this area, approximately 10 yearsago, I firmly believed that courts would treat marriages involving an in-tersex spouse differently from the way that they would treat marriages inwhich one of the spouses is a transsexual. I did not believe that theywould subject intersex persons to the same scrutiny as transsexuals. Atthat time, only one reported case on this issue existed, In re C and D, a1979 case from Australia.' 8 In that decision, the Australian Family Courtannulled a 12-year marriage between a woman and a man with an inter-sex condition. In its astounding conclusion, the court held that a truemarriage could not have occurred because \"the husband was neither aman nor a woman, but was a combination of both.\" 9 In other words, asa non-man/non-woman, he did not have the legal right to marry at all.This case has been severely criticized and it is clear that courts in Austra-lia, or elsewhere, would be unlikely to conclude that a person with anintersex condition is not allowed to marry at all.If the one recent reported case involving a spouse with an intersexcondition is a typical judicial reaction, it appears that courts may followthe same approach that they do in cases involving a transsexual spouse.In 2001, a court in England was asked to determine whether a marriagewas valid or whether the wife (who was referred to as \"W') was actually17. See In re Estate of Gardiner, 42 P.3d 120, 135 (Kan. 2002).18. In Marriage of C and D (falsely called C) (1979) 35 F.L.R. 340 (Ausfi.).19. In Marriage of C and D (falsely called C) (1979) 35 F.L.R. 340, 345 (Austl.).20101 BEYOND THE BINARY 2526 MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAW [V.173legally a man for purposes of marriage.\" At her birth, W's doctors wereunsure whether to assign her to the male or female sex. They left thedecision up to the parents, who decided to raise W as a boy. It was clearat a very young age that W identified as a girl and wanted to live her lifeas a female. When W turned 15, W's body began to feminize. Eventu-ally, she underwent medical procedures to further feminize her body.She lived her entire adult life as a woman.W married a man who sought an annulment of the marriage alleg-ing that W should not be considered a female. Although the courteventually validated the marriage and ruled that she was a female, it didso only after subjecting her to an intensive and invasive examination.The experts testified that they believed that W had an intersex condi-tion. Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (PATS). Women withPAIS have male chromosomes and testicles. Often, their genitalia do notappear to be clearly male or female. The court asked W to provide de-tailed evidence about the appearance of her genitalia before the surgerywas performed. She was questioned about the size of her phallus, theexistence of testicles and scrotal sac, whether she had a vagina, the loca-tion of the opening of her urethra, and whether she ever urinated in astanding position. The court acknowledged that she likely suffered em-barrassment and discomfort about being asked to provide this evidence.Despite her reticence to provide detailed information about the appear-ance of her genitalia, the court found this information critical to itsdetermination. In its findings, the court felt the need to provide an ex-tensive description of her genitalia and specifically located her urethralopening, \"1at, or near, the end or tip of the flap of skin,\" that would havebeen considered her phallus.2The judge eventually determined that she was legally a woman forpurposes of marriage and based his decision on the three criteria: her sexfactors, her history and the medical evidence, and her ability to con-summate the marriage. Based upon her history of self-identifying as afemale at a young age and choosing to live as a female before her surgeryand the diagnosis of PAIS, the court determined that assigning her tothe male sex on her birth record was an error.The English court's determination that the wife was a female andher marriage to a man was a legal heterosexual marriage is far superior tothe Australian judge's declaration that the husband with an intersexcondition was neither a man nor a woman. The decision, however,should not be hailed as a model for future courts to follow. To attain thelegal status of female and the right to marry a man, W was required to20. W v. W, [2001] Fain. I1I1 (Eng.).2 1. W v. W, [20011] Fain. 11I1 (Eng.).ol. 17:1326provide embarrassing intimate information about the appearance of hergenitalia, her ability to engage in intercourse, and her preferred positionfor urinating. In other words, the court treated her to the same type ofscruriny that has been applied in the cases involving a transsexualspouse.The second reason that I believe that the intersex community mayneed to be concerned relates to Mark's discussion about who has beenallowed to challenge the validity of a marriage. Before the Litteton andGardiner decisions, I thought that a court would not allow a third partyto challenge the validity of someone else's marriage. I had assumed thatthe cases would have to be brought by one of the spouses or potentiallythe state. As Mark mentioned, however, courts have given standing tostrangers to challenge another person's sex and the validity of a marriagein which they were not a party. The courts never discussed standing ineither the Litteton or Gardiner decisions. In Gardiner, a relative chal-lenged the marriage, but in Litteton, it was a doctor who was defendinga wrongful death action. The court allowed him to litigate ChristieLittleton's legal sex and marital status so that he could avoid paying lossof consortium damages in a wrongful death action.Therefore, the intersex community has to recognize that an intersexperson's legal sex could be challenged not only by the state, but also by atotal stranger.MARK STRASSER: One additional point about divisions withinor across communities. Beatie himself is somewhat controversial withinthe transgender community. Some members of the community haveparticular understandings of what it means to be a male or female andbelieve, for example, that men do not deliver babies. On their view,some individuals were simply born with the wrong parts, which can becorrected to some extent by gender reassignment surgery. Transitioningfrom one sex to another is fine-that is simply correcting a mistake. Buttransitioning from female to male and then delivering a child is to crossboundaries that should not be crossed. Others, of course, do not believethat Beatie broke any \"rules.\"MARYBETH HERALD: Julie's discussion about the court's ex-amination emphasizes the courts' adherence to the binary system. Inthese decisions, there is an emphasis on the physical attributes of maleand female, as well as social and cultural ones. For example, in the NewJersey decision, M T v. J T, the court considered the situation of a post-operative male-to-female transsexual married to a male. Although thecourt rejected the rule of birth sex as determinative, the court in M T alsofocused on the adequacy of M.T.'s reconstructed body for \"traditional20101 BEYOND THE BINARY 2728 ~MICHIGAN JOURN L OF GENDER & LAW [Vl173penile/vaginal intercourse. 22 The concern was whether the person's sex-ual machinery looks and could operate as a traditional female inperforming heterosexual intercourse. In the New Zealand case, Attorney-General v. Otahuhu Family Court, the court required that the marriagepartners have genitals of a male and female respectively. The court dis-pensed with the requirement that the person's genitalia were sexuallyfunctional, however. The step forward in Otahuhu was that as long asone of each sex was represented in the marriage, heterosexual appear-ances were served and no further information was required. One couldcross over and become a member of the opposite sex, but one could notdisturb the binary sex or heterosexual marriage scripts.Reinforcing the binary theme, some courts find it important thatthe crossover be complete. For example, in In re Marriage of Simmons,the court recognized a transsexual's surgical changes, but required acomplete crossover. Although the transsexual husband had some surgicalprocedures, there were several remaining to complete the transition. Thecourt found this failure to totally cross over dispositive because althoughthe petitioner did not have a uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, femalegenitalia were still in place.2 The appellate court affirmed the trialcourt's holding that petitioner's marriage was an invalid same-sex mar-riage because the petitioner was still a female. Similarly, in In re Heilig,the court was willing to endorse a change in birth certificate as long asthe petitioner provided sufficient medical evidence that the surgery wasirreversible.Although some courts have not required a complete physical cross-over to the opposite sex, the permanency of the changes have impressedthe courts. The female-to-male transsexual in the Australian case of In reKevin had undergone only partial reassignment surgery-a mastectomyand a total hysterectomy-but still had a vagina .2 ' Nevertheless, thecourt noted the irreversible nature of the surgery as the important point.The Australian court also placed emphasis on evidence that Kevin hadalways been perceived to be male through the testimony of 39 witnesses.It is the ability of Kevin to act stereotypically male-hogging the televi-sion channel changer?-that gives him the freedom to cross over from22.

Any drift away from stereotypical male behaviormay have proven fatal to the claim. The irony for feminists is that whilethere have been efforts to root out and destroy gender stereotyping, inthis case, the more stereotyping, the more successful the claim.JULIE GREENBERG: Mark has discussed the family law issues re-lating to marriage and parentage that arise in sex determination actions.I will briefly examine two other areas related to sex determination: iden-tity documents and housing, bathroom, and locker room use.As Mark mentioned, states vary widely in the \"sex\" test that theyuse in the family law cases. Similarly, states have adopted a variety of1sex' tests to determine the appropriate marker that should appear onsomeone's identity documents. Some states have statutes that allowtranssexuals to change the sex marker on their birth certificate. Othershave general name change statutes. Some have no controlling legislation.And, at least one state has a statute prohibiting a change of sex. In addi-tion, the Social Security Administration and the State Department havetheir own tests for sex determination that control the sex listed on socialsecurity records and on passports. In other words, a person's sex can varydepending upon which state or government agency is making the de-termination.\"Let's return to J'Noel Gardiner's case. J'Noel was born in Wisconsinand she was identified as a male at birth, but she had successfullychanged all of her Wisconsin records so that they indicated that she wasa female. If J'Noel had married in Wisconsin and the status of her mar-riage had been litigated in Wisconsin, she would have been determinedto be a female and her marriage to Marshall Gardiner would have beenconsidered a valid heterosexual marriage. But J'Noel traveled to Kansas,married there, and had her marriage challenged in the Kansas court sys-tem. When J'Noel crossed into Kansas, she was transformed back into alegal male and her marriage to a man was determined to be an invalidsame-sex union.To avoid this ludicrous situation, some might advocate for a univer-sal sex test. England has taken this approach and has adopted a nationallaw that many believe is a desirable model. In 2004, England adoptedthe Gender Recognition Act.2 This legislation allows transsexuals totransition for all legal purposes so that no conflict exists among mar-riage, social security, and identity document laws. The law isadvantageous *for many reasons, including the fact that transition isallowed even without surgical alteration. England's rejection of a surgical26. For a comprehensive list of these various rules see http://www.drbecky.com/birrhcert.hrml (last visited Nov. 8, 2009).27. Gender Recognition Act, 2004, c. 7 (Eng.).20101 930 ~MICHIGAN JOURN L OF GENDER & LAW [V.173requirement is critical because not all transsexuals want surgery, andeven for those who would choose to have a surgical procedure, it may beinaccessible because these surgeries are extremely expensive and for themost part, they are not covered by insurance policies or Medicare. Rec-ognizing this problem, England only requires an affidavit from a doctoror psychologist confirming the person's gender identity.England's approach, however, is potentially problematic for tworeasons. First, under the a conservative administration, the \"sex test\"would not be beneficial because they would make it very difficult totransition. Even with the Obama administration, I have my doubts thata universal sex test is desirable. I believe that the United States is notready to allow a legal sex transition without significant surgical altera-tion. Therefore, I believe that it would probably be better at this pointto allow the states to experiment until society is more open to allowing aperson's sex to be determined by his/her gender identity.England's law is problematic for a second reason. Married peoplewho want to transition in England must first divorce their currentspouse because England's laws still limit marriage to heterosexual cou-ples. Let's consider a couple in which one of the spouses is a male andone is a female. They have been married for years and the male decidesto transition to female. Although the couple is in love and wants to re-main married, England presents them with a Hobson~s choice. Thetranssexual spouse can live as a woman and be legally recognized as awoman only if she first obtains a divorce. If she wants to stay married,she is not allowed to be legally recognized as a woman. In other words,England has adopted a law that promotes the divorce of a happily mar-ried couple who may have children.The other alternative to a national approach is to continue thestate-by-state, agency-by-agency approach. If we allow states to continueto adopt contradictory tests for determining a person's legal sex, then weare confronted with the problem that people's legal sex, marital status,and parenting status may change as they cross state borders, which raisesa number of constitutional issues, including full faith and credit, theright to travel, substantive due process, and equal protection. We do nothave time to examine all of these issues in detail, but I want to spend afew moments just mentioning some of the current full faith and creditissues that have been raised .2Full faith and credit issues are becoming more important recentlybecause a number of transsexuals are seeking court orders that recognize28. For an in-depth discussion of these issues see Julie A. Greenberg & Marybeth Herald,You Can't Take it with You: Constitutional Consequences of Interstate Gender IdentityRulings, 80 WASH. L. REv. 819 (2005).ol. 17:13302010] BEYOND THE BINARY 3their transition. Even in states that do not require a court order, attor-neys are seeking court orders because an argument exists that courtorders should be given full faith and credit, while a sex change grantedby an administrative agency could be ignored under conflicts of lawprinciples. In addition to the full faith and credit issues raised by all ofthese orders, a problem is arising because some of the judges who areissuing them are not thinking through all of the ramifications. For ex-ample, I have recently seen court orders issued by judges in Texas forcurrent residents of Texas who were born in a different state. These courtorders are directing the registrar of birth records in a sister state, for ex-ample, Ohio, to modify the birth certificate. These judges are notaddressing the issue of whether a judge in Texas has jurisdiction over theactions of an administrative agency in Ohio.In addition to identity documents, a person's legal sex has also beenraised in other scenarios. For example, who can participate as a female inathletic events? Where should transsexuals and persons with an intersexcondition be allowed to live in sex-segregated facilities like dormitories,homeless shelters, and prisons? What bathroom and locker room shouldthey be allowed to use?As far as athletics are concerned, different athletic organizationshave utilized a variety of \"sex tests\" and the tests used have varied dra-matically over the years. The most recent tragedy involving athleticgender testing is the case of Caster Semenya. After Ms. Semenya wonthe 800-meter race in the World Championship, other teams challengedher ability to compete in the games as a female. They alleged that shewas not a woman. Ms. Semenya was forced to undergo extensive testing.The results of these tests were not released, but Ms. Semenya may havesome type of intersex condition. It also appears that Ms. Semenya, an 18year old, learned this news at the same time that it was exposed to theworld in sensational international headlines. She is not the first femaleathlete to have her sex challenged or to have the world learn the intimatedetails about her reproductive system and the appearance of her genita-lia.2Housing issues have arisen primarily in the prison context and havetypically involved transsexuals, although one reported appellate courtdecision addressed appropriate housing for a person with an intersexcondition. Most prisons do not have separate safe facilities fortranssexuals so male-to-femnale transsexuals are often housed in the malepopulation, where they are subjected to severe sexual abuse or isolated insolitary confinement, a placement usually reserved for dangerous29. LAMF Urges Caution of Semnenya Intersex Claims (Sept. 11, 2009), http:Ilwww.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/09/ 1 1/athletics.semenya.gender.iaaf/index.html.20101 132 MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER 6& LAW Vl173prisoners who pose a risk to others and prisoners who have misbehaved.For example, Mild Ann DiMarco, a female who was born with anintersex condition, was convicted for check fraud and was placed onprobation. When she violated the terms of the probation, she wasimprisoned. Despite a security-threat rating that indicated that sheposed no risk to herself or others, she spent 438 days in solitaryconfinement in a maximum-security prison. She was not allowed tointeract with other inmates and she had limited access to the day room,commissary, educational opportunities, haircuts, religious items, a radio,a lamp, or playing cards. She was forced to eat her meals alone in hercell, while sitting either on her bed or toilet. Mild was placed in solitaryconfinement because she was born with an intersex condition. Despitethe fact that she had lived as a female since puberty and was not sexuallyfunctional as a male, she remained in isolation throughout herincarceration .Homeless shelters and college dormitories present similar problems.This issue has not been litigated, but it appears that significant progressis being made in this area. A number of sex-segregated homeless sheltersallow persons to live in facilities that comport with their gender identity.Similarly, a number of colleges are also adopting more flexible ap-proaches. I have two sons, one who just graduated from college and onewho is a junior in college. Both their schools changed their housingpolicies recently and their housing form asks: Do you smoke? Whattime do you wake up? What is your personal gender identity: woman,man, other, prefer not to state? What is your biological sex: female,male, intersex, or prefer not to state? What do you prefer your room-mate is: male, female, transgender, intersex, or does not matter? Theschools leave all the options open. I think this is excellent progress.Finally, bathrooms and lockers rooms seem the most resistant tochange. Some public restroom facilities are now unisex, but most bath-rooms remain sex segregated and the male/female division is carefullypoliced. We even have cases in jurisdictions that prohibit discriminationbased on gender identity that have found that it is not sex discrimina-tion to bar a male-to-female transsexual from using the female31restroom.MLARK STRASSER: One of the interesting facets of the Gardinercase was that J'Noel's birth certificate was amended in light of Wiscon-sin law, and one of the questions before the Kansas Supreme Court waswhether to give credit to the Wisconsin record designating J'Noel as fe-male. While the state's policy on this was not entirely clear, there wasalready a regulation specifyring the conditions under which Kansas30. DiMarco v. Wyo. Dep't of Corr., 473 F.3d 1334 (10th Cir. 2007).31. Goins v. W. Group, 635 N.W.2d 717 (Minn. 2001).32 [ o . 17:132010] BEYOND THE BINARY 3would permit birth certificate modifications. So, it could hardly havebeen said that recognizing a modification to a birth certificate wouldhave violated an important Kansas public policy; on the contrary, per-mitting such modifications was in accord with Kansas policy. Given thatother states' records should be given some deference and that no Kansaspublic policy would have been violated by recognizing a birth certificateamendment, one might have expected the Kansas Supreme Court toregard the Wisconsin amended birth certificate as establishing thatJ'Noel was female.The Kansas court was fearful, however, that recognizing J'Noel'smarriage would somehow open the door to same-sex marriage. Thatsame fear may motivate courts in Texas to refuse to recognize marriagesinvolving a post-operative transsexual and someone not of her or hisself-identified sex, although as a practical matter this means that Texasonly permits post-operative transsexuals to marry individuals of theirself-identified sex.MARYBETH HERALD: The Gender Recognition Act in Eng-land\"2 is considered progressive and it does not require sex reassignmentsurgery. If you do not have the sex reassignment surgery, however, youdo have to have a certificate of gender identity disorder. Both optionsreinforce the binary system. The first requires surgical alteration to looklike the reassigned sex and the second requires one to assert that not fit-ting into the established binary pattern constitutes a medical issue.Early feminists also had the bathroom issue. Bathrooms, in fact,may have sunk the Equal Rights Amendment. When the Equal RightsAmendment was being considered, opponents emphasized the specter ofsame-sex bathrooms. Instead of voters favoring equal rights, they cameto fear same-sex bathrooms. It is interesting but disheartening to see itbeing raised again in this context.On a broader level, discussion and education on issues affectingtranssexual and intersex persons will be necessary to spur legislativechange. More groundwork has to be laid at the local and state level. Al-though interesting constitutional questions are raised by the treatmentof transsexuals as they cross state lines, it is probably not an opportunemoment to raise these issues in the court system until society movesforward in its understanding. It is possible, however, that some of thesequestions will arise when persons are denied their right to marry or aretreated differently when they move to another state. For example, doestreating post-operative male-to-female transsexuals differently from fe-males identified as females at birth violate equal protection? Do32. Gender Recognition Act, 2004, c. 7 (Eng.).20101 334 ~MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER 6& LAW [Vl173contradictory sex determination rulings infringe on the right to travelunder the dormant commerce clause and the privileges and immunitiesclauses? The question of whether litigation can affect social change ismuch debated.\"3 In the area of gay rights, the Supreme Court's infamousdecision in Bowers v. Hardwick inspired activism that accomplished thepolitical change that enabled the Supreme Court's reversal of that deci-sion in Lawrence v. Texas 3 almost twenty years later. But having baddecisions on the books can set a movement back, and litigation too earlyin a movement's life may cost valuable time and resources.MARK STRASSER. One more point to consider involves the De-fense of Marriage Act (DOMA) .3 ' The federal government did notinclude within that act any definition of sex. Perhaps this means that thefederal government will defer to the states, although that means thatthere is yet another layer of confusion, because states are defining sexdifferently-an individual might be female in New Jersey but male inTexas.MARYBETH HERALD: We have discussed the sex determinationissues in terms of family law, identity documents, housing, and bath-room use. We will now move to the topic of sex discrimination anddiscuss the meaning of the term \"sexe in the statutes that prohibit dis-crimination \"because of sex.\"A number of states and municipalities now explicitly prohibit dis-crimination based on gender identity or expression. The questionremains whether transsexuals and persons with an intersex condition areprotected under state laws that do not explicitly include these statuses orunder federal laws.Consider Tide VII, which covers discrimination in employment.Title VII's language prohibits discrimination \"because of sex.\" In earlycases, transsexuals might sue under Tide VII claiming, \"Well, if you'refiring me from my job because I'm transsexual, you're discriminatingbecause of sex.\" The courts responded, \"No, they are discriminatingagainst you because you are a transsexual and that does not violate Title33. See, e.g., GERALD N. ROSENBERG, THE HOLLOW HOPE: CAN COURTS BtUNG ABOUTSOCIAL CHANGE? (The University of Chicago Press 1993).34. Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 578 (2003).35. See 28 U.S.C.A. § 1738C (\"No State, territory, or possession of the United States, orIndian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial pro-ceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationshipbetween persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of suchother State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such rela-tionship.\").34 ol. 17:13VII.,,16 In the view of these courts, Title VII discrimination based on sexincluded cases where the employer fired a woman or refused to hire awoman to be a bartender, because the employer only hired men. If theemployer refused to hire or fired a transsexual, that was not based onsex, but on transsexual status, and not covered under Title VII. Al-though the courts voiced concerns about stereotyping in sexdiscrimination cases, the early courts' underlying conception of maleand female reflected rigid conceptions of male and female. Females haveXX chromosomes, look like women, want to have sex with men, andhave a female gender identity. Males have XY chromosomes, look andact stereotypically like men, and want to have sex with women. Al-though some males and females conform to the model, many do not. Ifyou deny a job to a male or female and they are the prototypical male orfemale, that is covered under Title VII. But if you deny a job to some-one who does not conform to the model, early courts glossed over thecomplexity of gender identity and often held that the discrimination wasnot \"because of sex\"' but rather because the plaintiff was gay, lesbian, ortranssexual, categories apparently disconnected from sex.The case of Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins\"7 represented a leap forwardin understanding. Ann Hopkins did not make partner in the firm.Rather than take what has become the well-worn path of stating pretex-tual reasons or remaining silent, luckily for her, the partners went on therecord with remarkable candor as to why they refused to admit her topartnership. Their reasoning was: \"You're just too macho. You shouldwalk more femininely, talk more femininely, and wear some jewelry andmakeup.\" The partners were not, in their opinion, opposed to having afemale in their ranks, but they wanted a stereotypical one. The SupremeCourt's opinion recognized that the partners took their action becauseAnn Hopkins did not conform to female stereotypes and that wasdiscrimination because of sex. Almost casually they stated, \"Really we'rebeyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assum-ing that they match the stereotype associated with their group.\" Withthat, the theory of sex stereotyping was born. That they discriminatedagainst Ann Hopkins because she did not engage in feminine behaviorwas, in fact, discrimination based on sex.Probably no member of the Supreme Court at that time knew thatthe Hopkins case would be so influential in cases of gay, lesbian, andtranssexual plaintiffs. But it turned out that what worked for feminists36. See, e.g., Ulane v. E. Airlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1984); Sommers v.Budget Mktg., Inc., 667 F.2d 748 (8th Cit. 1982); Holloway v. Arthur Anderson &Co., 566 F.2d 659 (9th Cit. 1977).37. Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 109 S. Ct. 1775 (1989).20101 BEYOND THE BINARY 3536 MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAW [Vl173trying to put forth a more sophisticated view of sex discrimination wasopening the door to other groups. Gays and lesbians were generally dis-missed out of Title VII because the discrimination was sexualorientatrion discrimination, not sex discrimination. But now the claim isframed as one based on failure to meet the gender stereotype that a maleis always sexually attracted to females, or females to males. The PriceWaterhouse partners discriminated against Ann Hopkins because shedid not conform to stereotypes about her sex and sexual orientation;claims come under Title VII's \"because of sce\" language because one isnot conforming to sex stereotypes. Similarly, in the 1 970s, when trans-sexuals would bring Title VII actions, their claims were uniformlyrejected. Now, after Hopkins, a transsexual plaintiff will frame the claimthat the defendant took the adverse employment action because theplaintiff did not conform to sex stereotypes, that is, not all females con-form to a female gender identity and not all males conform to a malegender identity. There are significant victories in the circuit courts ofappeals using this theory.For example, in one case a firefighter was living as a male but wastransitioning to female and he was harassed for his feminine appearance.He spoke to the supervisor and then was suspended. The court consid-ered the earlier cases rejecting the claims of transsexual plaintiffs butdismissed their reasoning in light of Price Waterhouse and its sex stereo-typing theory.\"8 The court held that discrimination against transsexualsis, in fact, covered under Title VII even without amendments to includethat specific type of discrimination.The most recent case where the court applied a theory of genderstereotyping is Schroer v. Biiington.\" Diane Schroer was offered a job asa terrorism analyst at the Library of Congress. She interviewed as Davebecause she had not formally transitioned from male-to-female. Aftergetting the job offer, she asked her new boss if she could start work as awoman to make a clean transition. The Library revoked the job offersaying she was not a \"good fit.\" Schroer sued under Title VII and theD.C. District Court denied the Librarys motion to dismiss, finding thatSchroer could bring a Title VII claim based on gender stereotyping anddiscrimination because of sex. As to the latter claim, the court used re-ligion to explain its reasoning in finding that discrimination based ontranssexual status was discrimination because of sex. If an employer dis-criminated against Christians or Jews, the employer would bediscriminating based on religion. Similarly, it would be discrimination38. Smith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566 (6th Cit. 2004). See also Barnes v. Cincinnati,401 F.3d 729. 737-38 (6\" Cir. 2005).39. Schroer v. Billington, 577 F. Supp. 2d 293, 306-08 (D.D.C. 2008).36 ol. 17:13based on religion if the employer discriminated against persons whoconverted to Judaism or Christianity. In Diane Schroer's case, discrimi-nating against her because of her transition from male to female was\"because of sex\" under Title VJI.Price Waterhouse provided one theory that united a variety ofgroups. By changing the focus from discrimination against a male or afemale, and recognizing the bundle of stereotypes that have become apart of those terms, each group is able to target the stereotypes thatplague their group. As the court in the Schroer case recognized, how-ever, there is no need to resort to a gender nonconformity theorybecause discrimination based on transsexual status is discrimination be-cause of sex.MARK STRASSER: In sum, families where one of the parents orspouses is rransgendered face a number of uncertainties. Even statespermitting sex markers on birth certificates to be changed may not treatsuch changes as valid for all purposes. Further, individuals born in onestate but living in another face additional uncertainties, because the lat-ter state may have different criteria for the conditions, if any, underwhich. birth markers can be changed or the purposes for which suchchanges will be recognized. The current law both within and acrossstates imposes unnecessary and unjustifiable burdens on the rransgen-dered and must be changed.JULIE GREENBERG: In addition to thinking about the effect ofthese laws and rulings on the transsexual community, lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transsexual, intersex, and feminist activists and scholars need tocarefully consider how they frame their claims and the alliances thatthey may want to form. These different groups share common goals, butthey also have unique concerns and issues that they seek to advance. Ibelieve all these communities could benefit from studying the history ofother social justice movements. Many approaches have led to progressfor a number of disenfranchised groups, while other tactics have resultedin marginalized groups being pitted against each other. As thesecommunities develop their strategies, they must be careful to considerthe effects of their approaches on other groups. t20101 37BEYOND THE BINARY",

    "abstract": "Our panel will be discussing recent developments in the intersex and transsexual communities. The transsexual community began to organize in the 1970s, but did not fully develop into a vibrant movement until the 1990s. The intersex movement was born in the mid-1990s and has rapidly developed a strong and influential voice. Recently, both movements have undergone profound changes and each has provided new and unique theoretical perspectives that can potentially benefit other social justice groups. The purpose of our dialogue today is to describe these developments and explore how feminists could potentially benefit from the theoretical frameworks that are being advanced by the intersex and transsexual communities",
