Stockslager, Ph.D. Assistant Honors Director            ______________________________ Date FROM HEO TO ZIR  3 Abstract With the growing presence of the LGBTQ+ community on the global stage, the matter of gender has been rushed to the forefront of the public consciousness. News outlets have hotly debated the topic of gender expression, a topic which has motivated mass demonstrations and acts of violence, and this has promoted a linguistic conversation at the international level.  This thesis is intended to provide the historical context for the contemporary debate on gender expression in the English language, and explores both the grammatical background (the Indo-European origins of linguistic gender, the development of the modern pronoun system, etc.) and the conceptual background (the Greek origins of “gender” as they differ from modern usage).        FROM HEO TO ZIR  4 From Heo to Zir: A History of Gender Expression in the English Language Introduction The LGBTQ+ community is everywhere. Though those who identify as homosexual, transgender, or genderqueer continue to constitute a small portion of the United States population, and an even smaller portion of the world at large, the vocal minority has successfully brought its concerns to the forefront of cross-cultural global dialogue. News outlets championed the cause of those suffering under Russia’s anti-LGBTQ+ regime; countries such as Canada have begun to add pro-LGBTQ+f clauses to their human rights protections; and, recently, Coca-Cola employed the use of a gender-neutral pronoun in an ad aired during Super Bowl LII. This last example is particularly noteworthy, as it indicates not only a social shift, but a linguistic shift as well. For much of human history, human gender has been understood as binary; there are females, and there are males. But now, whether one agrees with the concept or not, the LGBTQ+ community has posited a radical shift from the historical position: gender is not binary, but rather exists on a spectrum, with extreme masculinity on one end, and extreme femininity on the other. This presents a difficulty for the English language, which has inherited a set of pronouns that, though it is divided between animacy and gender, lacks a pronoun that conveys both human animacy and neutral gender. Modern speakers of English are thus faced with a conundrum: how is one to express the multiplicity or negation of gender in a referent when communicating with pronouns? The analysis of and answer to such a question is beyond the scope of this FROM HEO TO ZIR  5 work. Yet, in ascertaining an informed conclusion to the question, it is necessary that one should have a full understanding of the circumstances that have given rise to said question.  An investigation into the history of gender expression within the English language yields a rather complex linguistic history, with the collapsing of entire grammatical systems and the recurring prescriptive attempts to refine the collapse’s remains. Old English’s grammatical gender system, wherein words bore inflectional endings to coincide with agreement targets, gave way to Modern English’s natural gender system, in which the few preserved inflections agree with the gender of a given noun’s referent, even if it disagrees with the noun’s former grammatical gendering. The remainder of the history of English’s gender system merely consists of authors’ attempts to rectify grammatically ambiguous situations, such as instances where the gender is unclear (e.g., “a person”) or where a singular word communicates a plural idea (e.g., “everyone”). Prior to the prominence of the transgender community, these difficult situations were a purely grammatical dilemma—the debate over these situations played out among academics and editors of style guides; however, with the present spotlight on individuals with nonbinary gender identification, this formerly grammatical question has become a matter of political import. Yet, before dealing with English proper, it will be necessary to examine two separate historical threads that predate the written English record: the history of grammatical gender as a linguistic concept, and the actual development and history of grammatical gender in language. FROM HEO TO ZIR  6 Greeks and Grammar: The Origin of Gender as a Concept One of the earliest written references to the concept of gender is found in Aristotle’s Rhetoric: τέταρτον, ὡς Πρωταγόρας τὰ γένη τῶν ὀνομάτων διῄρει, ἄρρενα καὶ θήλεα καὶ σκεύη: δεῖ γὰρ ἀποδιδόναι καὶ ταῦτα ὀρθῶς: (Aristotle) (The fourth rule consists in keeping the genders distinct—masculine, feminine, and neuter, as laid down by Protagoras; these also must be properly introduced.) Rhetoric was written in the fourth century B.C., and references an even earlier philosopher as the source of linguistic gender: Protagoras. Protagoras himself was the first of a group that would later be called sophists, professional teachers for hire who inculcated the basic tenets of philosophy and rhetoric into the minds of young statesmen. Despite his having a great influence, being cited by both Aristotle and Plato, none of Protagoras’ works have survived into the modern era; thus, what little that can be recovered of his thought comes secondhand. This results in the difficult situation of interpreting Protagoras’ observations on language without the greater contextual schema of his philosophy. For instance, at first glance, the above passage from Rhetoric appears to denote what one would expect: there are three grammatical genders (“γένη”), the masculine (“ἄρρενα”), the feminine (“θήλεα”), and the neuter (“σκεύη”). The terms ἄρρενα and θήλεα are easy enough to understand; they frequently appear in opposition with each other, and are the same words rendered in the Septuagint’s translation of Genesis 1:27: “male and female he created them.” But what of σκεύη? J. H. Freese, whose translation of FROM HEO TO ZIR  7 the passage is provided above, includes a footnote stating that the word may better be rendered as “‘inanimate things,’ the classification probably being male, female, and inanimate, [and] not the grammatical one of masculine, feminine, and neuter” (Freese). Since Greek’s grammatical gender system makes no distinction between animate and inanimate, this distinction is probably more notional than grammatical. And furthermore, what is meant by γένη? Though γένη is a cognate with Latin genus, the etymological root of English gender, modern readers should be careful, and ensure that they do not read modern meanings into an ancient text. Γένη only denotes a “type,” “kind,” or “race,” and definitely does not bear the same meaning that modern gender bears today. Fortunately, this brief excerpt from Rhetoric is not the only instance wherein Aristotle discusses gender. In his Poetics, he gives a more thorough treatment of the subject, though the Protagorean roots are not mentioned. “Of the nouns themselves,” he says, “some are masculine, some feminine, and some neuter. Masculine are all that end in N and P and Σ […] Feminine are all that end in those of the vowels that are always long, [and] the neuters end in [I and Y, as well as] in Ν and Σ” (Poetics 1458). While his reasoning includes vast generalizations with numerous exceptions, this categorizing of nouns based on their formal qualities (here, their terminal phonemes), rather than their referents, indicates that, even if Protagoras himself did not view the noun classes as being grammatically-rooted, by the time of Aristotle’s writing Poetics, gender was understood as a grammatical concept. But the question remains as to why Protagoras labelled these grammatical categories with semantically-gendered terms, or, if Protagoras did view these as semantic FROM HEO TO ZIR  8 categories, why Aristotle persisted in using the erroneous semantic labels. The answer is found in the semi-semantic nature of Greek’s gender system. In a semi-semantic grammatical gender system, nouns with male referents tend to bear a masculine gender, while nouns with feminine referents tend to bear a feminine gender; however, many words with sexless or inanimate referents also bear a masculine or feminine gender. Thus, the personal referents bearing sex-based gender are exceptions in a larger system where gender is non-semantic (Foundalis 3). For example, the Greek word ἀρσεν, which means “man,” is grammatically masculine, but so is λογος, “word.” Given the high frequency with which gendered entities are referenced in the discussion of human affairs, it is only natural that Protagoras and Aristotle noticed the correlation between referent and grammatical gender. The progression of western civilization has created a clear tradition of grammatical thought which, finding its inception in Ancient Greece, was passed down to classical Rome and to modern linguistic scholars. Greek linguistic thought became codified in the first century B.C., when the first grammar books were written. The preeminent example of this was The Art of Grammar, written by Dionysius Thrax. While Dionysius’ goal was to restore the Greek language to the poetic heights of Homer, he entrenched himself in the linguistic tradition of Protagoras, including a brief passage on the three potential genders of nouns (Rodby and Winterowd 5). Observing the utility of Dionysius’ grammar, the Romans adopted and adapted the Greek grammar to Latin, which also bore a three-gender grammatical system. The territorial dominance of Rome led to a cultural dominance as well, and the continued use of Latin as an administrative FROM HEO TO ZIR  9 and ecclesiastical lingua franca resulted in the widespread use of the works of Roman grammarians well into the Middle Ages, where an “education,” to a large extent, simply meant learning Latin grammar. By the time Englishmen sought to transcribe the grammar of their own vernacular, they had a well-established tradition to borrow from, a tradition that had continued to employ a three-part distinction in gender, and had utilized semantic terms to discuss that distinction. Conjecture and Comparative Linguistics: The Origins of Grammatical Gender  Both the semi-semantic grammatical gender system of Aristotle’s Greek and the natural gender system of modern English find their origin in the Proto-Indo-European language, the hypothetical parent of such diverse languages as Hindi-Urdu, Latin, Hittite, and Punjabi. Because of Proto-Indo-European’s predating the inception of writing, scholars do not know what the language sounded like; however, this has not stopped historical linguists from attempting to reconstruct the language through comparative linguistics. By observing the changes that languages gradually undergo over time, and by comparing and contrasting the oldest representatives of the Indo-European language group, linguists have been able to make well-educated guesses at the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary of Proto-Indo-European.  It is believed that the Indo-European language had a gender system, and possibly one that was semantically based; however, this gender system was not one based in a masculine-feminine-neuter divide, but was rather based in a division between animate and inanimate alone. Words in such a system would bear particular inflections depending on whether the agreement target’s referent was human. This animacy distinction was only FROM HEO TO ZIR  10 between humans and non-humans; though many languages, such as Navajo, bear a multiplicity of animacy categories, Proto-Indo-European only had two. If a referent was human, then a noun would take an animate inflection; if not, it would take an inanimate inflection.  But, one may ask, where did this animate-inanimate gender system come from? To attempt to answer that question means reaching the edge of what can feasibly be reconstructed. The most widespread conjecture is that the ancestor to Proto-Indo-European had demonstrative pronouns correlating with animate and inanimate objects, and that the repetitive use of these pronouns led to their becoming grammaticalized as affixes.  The matter of how the animate-inanimate bipartite system gave rise to the tripartite division of masculine, feminine, and neuter is more within the realm of knowledge, but still lacks a singular scholarly consensus. The point of difficulty is discerning when and how the feminine gender developed, as most linguists see continuity between the animate and the masculine and between the inanimate and the neuter. David J. Peterson, a language-expert most notable for his work on the naturalistic, constructed languages of Game of Thrones, stated that “[s]ex-based gender systems tend to arise from animal terminology” (116). In a similar vein, linguists in the first half of the twentieth century developed the position that the feminine gender arose during the domestication of livestock. This occurred due to the differences between the specific (singular) and the general (plural). In herding livestock, there tend to be numerous females, with only one or two males. To the herder or breeder, it is important to distinguish between the two FROM HEO TO ZIR  11 sexes. While one could intentionally coin new sexed words to make the necessary distinction—English does this with “bull” and “cow”—it appears that the Indo-Europeans subconsciously began to correlate the plural with the feminine, due to the numerous females, and the singular with the male, due to the presence of a lone bull or stallion. Thus, through common usage among shepherds and horse-wranglers, singular endings began to be used for masculine livestock, while the generic, plural endings were employed for the feminine. These could have then been applied through analogy to other entities, such as male and female humans.  After the initial adoption of gender inflections, said inflections persisted for multiple reasons. For one, gender agreement provided a means of redundancy; it is much easier to determine an error in speech when there is an error in agreement. On a similar note, grammatical gender inflections allowed for more expedient referent tracking; if both a pronoun and its targeted noun take gender markings, then a listener can more accurately determine the anaphoric reference of multiple pronouns in a single passage of discourse.  Yet these reasons for the persistence of gender should not be confused as motivations for the adoption of gender. Like most linguistic shifts, the adoption of gender inflections most likely occurred subconsciously over the span of multiple generations. Simple demonstratives for animate and inanimate gave way to inflected gender endings, and the continued application and eventual misapplication of those endings allowed them to bear meanings foreign to those originally intended, giving rise to the tripartite model of gender classification so ubiquitous amongst the Indo-European language family.  FROM HEO TO ZIR  12 Concerning “Male” Women: Old English and the Collapse of Grammatical Gender  By the time English appears in the written record, beginning the history of English proper, thousands of years have passed, radically changing the language from its Indo-European roots. When the first words were written in the English tongue, English bore little resemblance to its mother language; yet, despite this, it still managed to preserve its Indo-European grammatical gender system. Old English adjectives, demonstratives, and personal pronouns each took endings (or in some cases, entirely different and distinct forms) based on the grammatical gender inherent in a word. For those familiar with modern Romance languages, the concept is the same. Just as a book in Spanish (“libro”) is always “masculine,” causing any words modifying it to take an -o ending, so too did an Old English child (“cild”) force a neuter agreement.  Yet Old English’s grammatical gender system, from its first appearance in the written record, was in a much more precarious position than its Romance counterparts. First and foremost, English was a Low West Germanic language, meaning that, by its very nature, it was prone to the loss of inflection, and thus the loss of grammatical gender. This is because English, in its earliest forms, “show[ed] the adoption of a strong stress accent on the first syllable of the root of most words, a feature of great importance in all the Germanic languages” (Baugh and Cable 47). Since the initial syllable of a word was stressed, emphasis began to taper off by the end of words. This resulted in the gradual decay of inflectional endings, first through the reduction of final vowels to a schwa (the final vowel in the word China), and then later through the loss of many final inflectional consonants (Curzan 60). FROM HEO TO ZIR  13  Another factor predisposing English to the loss of grammatical gender was the nature of Old English’s gender agreement. Unlike its Latinate counterparts, the “gender of nouns in Old English was not so generally indicated by the declension.” That is to say, unlike Spanish libro, with its clear gender-marker in the final -o, Old English nouns did not have clear formal cues as to what gender nouns took. Wifmann (“woman”), engel, (“angel”), and nama (“name”) are all grammatically masculine, but nothing in their forms or referents indicates this. Rather, gender was revealed “by the concord of the strong adjective and the demonstratives. These by their distinctive endings generally showed, at least in the singular, whether a noun was masculine, feminine, or neuter” (Baugh and Cable 161).  Language functions on the premise of distinction. The only reason one knows the difference between but and putt is because of the distinction of voicing between the initial b and p; the syntactic functions of nouns are determined in modern English through the distinct ordering of words. It is because of this driving factor of distinction that, if two declensions, through sound shift, eventually become indistinct, they will be dropped. Once the inflections of the gender-distinguishing demonstratives and adjectives were reduced to a single, indistinguishable schwa, it was only a matter of time before English speakers ceased to pronounce that schwa as well. Yet, the decay of grammatical gender did not necessarily demand a shift to natural gender; after all, the masculine and feminine personal pronouns he and heo had almost become indistinct by the time the demonstratives’ and adjectives’ decay to the schwa had been completed. English may have just as easily returned to its Proto-Indo-European FROM HEO TO ZIR  14 roots and adopted an animate-inanimate gender distinction in the singular pronouns. What instigated the shift to a natural gender system? It is possible that the answer may be found in the semi-semantic nature of Old English’s gender system. Like the aforementioned Greek of Aristotle, Old English pronouns, though intended to agree through grammar, did have an understood notional meaning. Though many might assume, since the Old English shift from grammatical to natural gender caused pronouns to carry semantic information, that the opposite of this shift must also be true, that prior to the natural gender system, the pronouns carried no semantic value at all, this is not the case (Curzan 60). This reality can be seen through the minority of personal nouns in Old English wherein the grammatical gender and natural gender do not coincide. As Curzan notes, “for almost all general terms for human beings in Old English, the grammatical gender of the noun and the ‘natural gender’ (or socially constructed gender) of the referent correspond” (61); however, there were many nouns with widespread usage that did not have this correspondence, and for this “set of well-known exceptions to [the] rule of gender correspondence […] natural gender almost always prevails in the anaphoric pronouns” (62). In her corpus study of Old English texts, Curzan found that the words wif (“woman;” neuter) and wifmann (“woman;” masculine), are almost always referred to with feminine pronouns. Wifmann was referenced with feminine anaphora 16 out of 18 times, while wif was referenced 116 out of 118 times. This phenomenon still occurred even when masculine and neuter modifiers were present in the antecedent noun phrase. Every time that the neuter mægden (“maiden”) was referenced with an anaphoric pronoun (which totals to 25 times), the pronoun was FROM HEO TO ZIR  15 feminine, despite the fact that nine of the noun phrases included non-feminine forms (63). Thus, it appears that an understood correspondence between the masculine and feminine pronouns and their natural referents existed even while the grammatical gender system was in full force. Such a reality may be one of the primary causes as to why the speakers of Late Old English and Early Middle English preserved the gender distinction in the pronouns and applied said distinction to natural gender. A Successful Pronoun Shift: The Adoption of She and They  By the dawn of Early Middle English, the three formally distinct Old English pronouns he (masculine), heo (feminine), and hie (plural), had become nearly indistinguishable in many English dialects. The language had all but deserted its former inflections in the nouns, adjectives, and articles, and it seemed briefly that the personal pronouns would condense into an indistinguishable he as well. However, whether intentionally or subconsciously, speakers of Middle English preserved the inflectional gender distinction in their language by adopting two new pronouns: she and they.  Of the two, they has the much simpler history; it was a borrowing from Old Norse. This adoption of a function word—a third-person plural pronoun—is somewhat anomalous in linguistic history. Though content words are very easily borrowed between languages (the Italian word for “computer” is simply the English computer), function words, such as auxiliary verbs, demonstratives, articles, and pronouns, tend to express the greatest resistance to change, and are thus rarely adopted between languages. Yet, the circumstances between English and Old Norse were rather unique. Having repeatedly invaded the western shores of England, the Danes eventually conquered and settled in the FROM HEO TO ZIR  16 Northwest of Great Britain; this settlement led to continued tensions between the English and the Danes, as the Danes sought to continue their conquest. King Ælfred, successfully resolving the crisis of the Danish Invasion, had the Danes baptized, and established the Danelaw, a section of Britain wherein the English and Danes could live in peace. The close mingling of English and Norse in the Danelaw may have aided the general loss of inflections. Both English and Norse were West Germanic languages, and thus shared a similar vocabulary; however, they had different inflectional paradigms. The constant interaction between the two peoples, each with various means of inflecting words, may have instigated the general reduction of their respective inflections. One manner in which Old Norse undoubtedly influenced English, though, is in the adoption of the gender-neutral plural pronoun they. They was borrowed in all of its forms, typically beginning with the nominative, and then being adopted in the oblique cases (accusative them and genitive their).  So, they was borrowed from Old Norse “in response to a functional need for clearer communications, since the Old English pronouns were phonetically merging, creating the great potential for ambiguity in reference” (Curzan 193). Since hie had become indistinct from he and heo, some clarity in referent tracking was necessary, and, as there was a solution to this ambiguity readily available in the Danish community living in England, which spoke a language very akin to English, the speakers of English adopted the gender-neutral plural they.  The development of she occurred because of a similar motivation, “the loss of distinctively gendered nominal inflections transferred all gender-marking functions to the FROM HEO TO ZIR  17 pronouns, which could have heightened speakers’ need to preserve the gender distinction in the pronominal forms” (193); however, rather than being a mere loan-word, many scholars now believe that she developed internally from English itself. This occurred through a sound-shift. Through generational repetition, the Old English heo most likely contracted to /hjo/. From there, the initial h probably transformed into the palatal fricative /ç/ (the initial sound in hue and huge), indicated by the spellings ȝo and ȝho. Finally, the palatal fricative probably developed into the modern “sh” sound /ʃ/, giving rise to, more or less, the modern form of she. Evidence for this shift can be seen when one tracks the diachronic, geographic spread of the variant spellings of heo, hio, and ȝho. The spread occurs from the Northwest to the Southeast, from the Danelaw to Wessex. Regions begin with /h/ initial pronouns, which are then replaced by initial palatal fricative pronouns, spelled with ȝ, and from the palatal fricative forms arise the common, initial “sh” sound.  Yet, as in almost all topics within historical linguistics, the jury is still out. While this thesis supports an internal development of she, some believe that Old Norse also had an influence in the shift. It may have been that Old Norse was going through a similar sound shift at the same time. This, though, seems like a much less likely option. “Everyone Loves His Mother”: Gender-Neutral He  With the adoption of she and they, the English natural-gender pronoun system had reached its modern form. And, with this modern form arose the same contemporaneous questions of usage that modern speakers face today: mainly, what does one do when faced with referents that either lack gender or demonstrate a multiplicity of gender. A common example can be found in the phrase “Everyone loves ________’s mother.” What FROM HEO TO ZIR  18 should go in the blank? While the word everyone demonstrates a plural idea, and thus an ambiguous gender, it is in and of itself a singular pronoun; thus, the only “correct” answers that English gives are he, she, and it. The last of these can be removed from consideration due to its representing the inanimate, but which of the two remaining should be chosen? The prescriptivists would respond that the only true answer is the gender-neutral he.  While it may seem counter-intuitive to have a clearly gendered pronoun represent ambiguous gender, to the prescriptivists, it merely seemed natural. The prescriptivists were a group of writers and grammarians functioning within the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that, as their name would imply, demonstrated a grammatical philosophy for linguistic prescription. They believed that the purpose of grammar was to describe language as it ought to be, rather than to describe language as it is. As was the case with their forefather, Dionysius Thrax, their written grammar books were intended to preserve the language, and to elevate it to a higher form of logical beauty. They thought that logical speech led to logical thought, so making language more logical would inspire better thinking. It was from this group that modern rules against common usages arose, such as the rule that one should not end a sentence with a preposition.  Prescriptive thought was first applied to the generic pronoun problem in Lindley Murray’s English Grammar, published in 1794. In the Grammar, Murray describes the “violation of number agreement in sentences where they is used to refer to an indefinite singular noun” and labels all such situations as erroneous, correcting them to he without providing an explanation for his reasoning (Curzan 59). A little more than fifty years FROM HEO TO ZIR  19 later, in 1850, an act of Parliament determined the “correctness” of generic he. In order to shorten legal documents and to cease using the cumbersome he or she, The Interpretation Act decreed that “in all acts words importing the masculine gender [would] be deemed and taken to include females, and the singular to include the plural, and the plural the singular, unless the contrary as to gender or number [was] expressly provided” (60). Those who wrote the law did not know it at the time, but this act, as sexist as it might appear today, gave credence to the women’s suffrage movement, as the suffragettes argued that the use of he in voting acts was that of a generic he, and thus included women as well.  While many today would state that the attempts of the prescriptivists were misguided, and were artificially intended to change the language in unnatural ways, corpus research demonstrates that gender-neutral, generic he has a well-attested history of usage prior to the prescriptivist movement. In Old English, for instance, generic terms, like oðer (“other”), invariably take masculine anaphoric pronouns, “even when both sexes are clearly specified” (65) An example of this can be found in Alfred’s translation of Pope Gregory’s Cura Pastoralis, where, when discussing “sexual distance” in marriage, he writes Ne fornime ince noðer oðer ofer will butan geðafunge, ðæm timum ðe he hine wille gebiddan, ac geæmtigaeð ince to gebedum. (Sweet 199) (Do not, neither of you, deprive the other against his will without consent, at the times when he wants to pray, but have time to yourselves for prayers.) FROM HEO TO ZIR  20 The Old English masculine pronoun appears to have been able to include both genders in instances where both the male and female were intended; neither Gregory nor Alfred intends a homosexual relationship in this passage, but rather group both males and females under he hine. This may have been due to convention, as most of those who were writing and reading in the Old English period were men, or it may have been due to formal cues, since the largest noun class in Old English is the masculine noun class. Either way, the prescriptivists’ efforts to impose gender-neutral he upon English were not wholly foreign to the language—the generic usage of he can be traced to Chaucer and the era of Beowulf—rather, they appear to be a concerted effort to ensure uniformity through the selection of one internal solution, though they opted for the more widely derided number agreement of he. “Everyone Loves Thon’s Mother”: The Epicene Pronouns  Though many of the prescriptivists opted to support the legally-sanctioned gender-neutral he, many were unsatisfied with the resolution. Rather than utilizing gender-neutral, generic he, these fringe-prescriptivists sought to introduce a new pronoun into the English language. This epicene pronoun, that is, a pronoun that bears no attachment to either sex, was intended to fill the ambiguous void where gender-neutral he had been unnaturally placed. Yet, as was the case with the majority of the desired reforms established by the prescriptivists, no epicene pronouns ever enjoyed widespread usage in the English language. Given the innumerable times wherein a prospective grammarian wished to leave an indelible mark on the spoken word, this history will not provide an FROM HEO TO ZIR  21 exhaustive list of every pronoun ever conceived1; however, this history will note significant contributors to the development of the epicene pronoun, and will also expound upon the history of the more common pronouns used and discussed today.  One of the earliest would-be grammarians to propose a solution to the epicene void was one James Anderson; Anderson, writing in 1792, published an article titled “Grammatical Disquisitions” in The Bee; or, Literary Weekly Intelligencer. Anderson, like Lindley Murray, was a prescriptive, philosophical grammarian, who not only sought to summarize and explain the various components of language, but also dictated what made one language superior to another. The concord between English’s gendered pronouns and their natural referents was one of the elements of the language that Anderson praised, and he was tempted to mark English as superior on that merit alone: “This language too,” he writes, “possesses the singular elegance of following nature precisely with regard to gender, as far as the number of genders we have adopted will permit” (194). Yet Anderson also noticed a “defect” in the English language, brought about by the failing of pronouns to comprehend nouns bearing both sexes; he gives “friend, servant, [and] neighbour” as examples (195). Though he notes one resolution to this problem in a colloquialism native to Glocestershire, the pronoun ou, which can apparently be used in place of he, she, or it, Anderson states that the adoption of a singular epicene pronoun is not enough; rather, while English is adding pronouns, it should not be satisfied until it has fulfilled a total of thirteen gender categories. The                                                           1 For a more exhaustive treatment, including such pronouns as hiser, han, and un, see Baron’s “The Epicene Pronoun: The Word that Failed.” FROM HEO TO ZIR  22 following are what he calls the “obvious distinctions” that should be brought about by linguistic gender classification: 1st, To denote male animals alone, which might constitute the . . .

(Anderson 198)  The most humorous part of this listing may be the brief comment with which Anderson concludes: “Some lesser distinctions are omitted to avoid the appearance of unnecessary refinement” (199).  Though most proposers of epicene pronouns have faded into obscurity, Anderson, despite being the first, has faded into the deepest. It is probably fortunate that he did not propose actual pronouns to fulfill his thirteen-point model, but even his briefly mentioned ou appears to have fallen out of usage.  The most recognized of the proposed epicene pronouns, though a pronoun that still failed to receive widespread recognition, was the Converse pronoun, thon FROM HEO TO ZIR  23 (pronounced /ðǝn/, and not like the last syllable of marathon). Coined by Charles Crozat Converse, an attorney and hymnist from Erie, Pennsylvania, most sources state that thon’s invention dates to 1858, eight years after the passing of the Interpretation Act; however, Baron, in his extensive research on the early epicene pronouns, fails to find a verifiable source for that date. The earliest published usage of thon that he found was traced to 1884 in The Critic. Converse briefly explains that he had spent several years grappling with the problem of the gender-neutral third-person singular pronoun, and tried multiple failed coinages, yet he settled on thon as the most desirable, a contraction of the phrase “that one.”  Converse’s proposal caused quite a stir in the journalistic and editorial community, with many people writing in support of or opposition to the new pronoun. Those who supported it noted the ungrammatical nature of all rivaling solutions, such as they or he, while those in opposition merely stated that it would never catch on. Converse himself appears to have been a lifelong supporter of his little pronoun, as, when an anonymous contributor wrote into The Writer: A Monthly Magazine for Literary Works inquiring, “What has become of that impersonal pronoun which was to be evolved before now for the economy of writers’ brain-power?” (231), none other than one Charles Crozat Converse emerged from the woodwork to provide a response. “Did The Writer’s limits permit,” he writes, “I would quote in extenso from the hundreds of personal letters and journals of education, etc. commending the public adoption of ‘thon’ which have been received by me in evidence of the growing common consent which ‘thon’ is securing for itself” (248). Yet, in spite of the lamented word-count, he still quotes from a FROM HEO TO ZIR  24 few letters, including that of one Mr. John Kenned, the author of “What Words Say,” who states that “other attempts [were] made to supply the missing pronoun, but the words offered [were] more or less arbitrary and gratuitous”; Converse’s pronoun, on the other hand, has more “the appearance of a discovery than an invention” (247). Converse’s shameless promotion, though never elevating thon to the ultimate acceptance that he heartily desired, nevertheless resulted in some degree of success. Unlike any other proposed epicene pronoun, the Converse pronoun made it into the dictionary, being listed in Webster’s Second New International Dictionary, published in 1934. As Converse passed away, however, and excitement for the proposed pronoun dissipated, the word fell into obscurity, and was quietly dropped from Webster’s Third.   But Converse’s influence did not just lead to the invention of one gender-neutral pronoun. His shameless publicizing in The Writer inspired James Rogers from Crestview, Florida, to coin the original version of what has since been termed the “Spivak Pronoun.” His version was inflected as e for the nominative, es for the genitive, and em for the accusative, and was inspired by the common contraction of them in such phrases as “Let’em come.” Rogers, contesting that his pronoun was superior to the Converse pronoun, argued that everyone must be told how to pronounce thon, making it less suitable for widespread acceptance; further, thon was “more than twice as long as e” and was much more difficult to say (13).  Rogers’ pronoun never gained much notice outside of the editorial section of The Writer, but would eventually be resurrected sixty years later by Christine M. Elverson of Skokie, Illinois. Elverson, apparently unaware of Rogers’ pronoun, won a contest that FROM HEO TO ZIR  25 had been held by the Chicago Association of Business Communicators to find replacements for the cumbersome phrases “he and she,” “him and her,” and “his and hers.” Like Rogers’ earlier pronouns, her pronouns, ey, em, and eir, were inspired by dropping the “th” from they, them, and their. This basic phenomenon of transforming a simple contraction in they’s objective form into a full-fledged pronoun declension is what defines the Spivak pronoun.  After Donald MacKay published a study in American Psychologist investigating the miscomprehension of gender-neutral he as compared to epicene pronouns (he adapted Elverson’s pronouns for use in his study), a mathematician and educator, Michael Spivak, wrote an AMS-TeX manual, The Joy of TeX (1983), using the gender-neutral pronouns E, Em, and Eir. It was this usage in The Joy of TeX that would eventually give the Spivak pronoun its name, as a MOO programmer, Roger Crew, in order to test the pronoun code in his LamdaMOO game, added “spivak” as a choice in gender. Crew’s Spivak pronoun declined as e, em, eirs, and emself. Through its inclusion in the LamdaMOO server, the Spivak pronoun gained widespread usage, and it still maintains a committed group of online users today.  The final pronoun to be discussed, and the one most prevalent among the LGBTQ+ community, is the pronoun Ze. Ze, despite its attested usage at American universities and in LGBTQ+ publishing, is not present in the Oxford English Dictionary, Meriam-Webster, or the American Heritage Dictionary. The only citation in a recognized dictionary comes from Dictionary.com, which is itself derived from the Random House Dictionary. While the dictionary lists the proper definition, every headline or historic FROM HEO TO ZIR  26 quote that utilizes the supposed word is either a name (as in “Ze Frank”), or a mocking phonetic spelling of the in a German accent. Dictionary.com lists the earliest attestation of the word as being sometime between 1970 and 1975. This is probably referencing a discussion from the Newsletter of the American Anthropological Association in September of 1972. “Steven Polgar of Chapel Hill, North Carolina propos[ed] the ze paradigm [of ze, zim, zees, and zeeself] on the analogy of German sie” (Baron 94). While the nominative ze remains unchanged between Polgar’s recommendation and the modern declension, the remaining forms are completely different. By the time that Ze resurfaced as a pronoun in use amidst the transgender community, the declension was ze, hir, hirs, and hirself, where hir is pronounced as homophonous to “here.” However, confusion over pronunciation in the possessive, objective, and reflexive forms, as well as the non-standard initial consonant between said forms and the nominative, resulted in a shift toward a paradigm of ze, zir, zirs, and zirself. Ze briefly exhibited another paradigm when in the fall of 1997, Ithaca College’s Richard E. Creel proposed ze, zer, and mer (he fails to provide a reflexive form). Given his explanations for the pronouns, it appears that Creel lacked a knowledge of Polgar’s Ze paradigm from twenty-five years before. His reasoning is not rooted in the German sie, but rather in borrowing the initial consonant of she and the vowel of he; he mutates the initial consonant of the derived “*se” as to refrain from homophony with see or sea. Thus, he ends with ze.  As can be easily seen in the discussion of Ze and the Spivak pronoun, most gender-neutral third-person pronouns failed to gain notoriety because of their creators’ ignorance of the pronoun dilemma’s history. The Spivak pronoun was reinvented FROM HEO TO ZIR  27 multiple times due to this lack of knowledge, and Ze, in its short history, has failed to find a unified paradigm. Had the many movements that have sought a solution to the pronoun problem unified behind one of these options, English speakers could have now been learning a neuter third-person pronoun as part of their linguistic education. “Everyone Loves Their Mother”: A Descriptive Solution  Nothing has been said thus far on gender-neutral, singular they, and that has been intentional. Throughout this entire history of gender-shifts and epicene inventions, one consistent resolution to the pronoun problem has arisen in the mouths of English speakers: the gender-neutral, singular they. Exhibiting a history and usage nearly as extensive as gender-neutral he, gender-neutral they has been employed by many of the most well-regarded writers in the English language. Shakespeare writes, “There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me / As if I were their well-acquainted friend,” when the “proper” rendering should be his (130); Jane Austen writes, “Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves,” when the “correct” construction should be herself (323); and Henry Fielding writes that “every Body fell a laughing, as how could they help it,” when he should have employed he or she, one, or simply the gender-neutral he (459). The Oxford English Dictionary lists the earliest entry of gender-neutral they as 1375, in a Middle English translation of William of Palerne, and the singular usage has undoubtedly been employed continuously since that date, as Lindley Murray, James Anderson, and Charles Crozat Converse each lamented its improper application in proper writing. FROM HEO TO ZIR  28  And while it is not the intent of this history to prescribe a solution to the pronoun dilemma, it is noteworthy that this solution to the problem is the only descriptive one. While every other attempt to rectify the dilemma has been an effort to explain what language ought to be, the solution of gender-neutral they merely explains what language already does. It is likely that gender-neutral, singular they will gain wider and wider acceptance, while the other epicene pronouns will go the way of the dinosaurs. The unabating political stigma toward ze seems to have disqualified it from general use (Duffy), while gender-neutral they, on the other hand, has already won “Word of the Year,” a feat that no other pronoun can flaunt (Guo).

    "abstract": "With the growing presence of the LGBTQ+ community on the global stage, the matter of gender has been rushed to the forefront of the public consciousness. News outlets have hotly debated the topic of gender expression, a topic which has motivated mass demonstrations and acts of violence, and this has promoted a linguistic conversation at the international level.\nThis thesis is intended to provide the historical context for the contemporary debate on gender expression in the English language, and explores both the grammatical background (the Indo-European origins of linguistic gender, the development of the modern pronoun system, etc.) and the conceptual background (the Greek origins of “gender” as they differ from modern usage)",
