Executive SummaryWhen foundations and other institutional grant-makers invest in policy advocacy, communityorganizing and civic engagement by nonprofit organi-zations, does it make a difference for local residents?This report describes, measures and, where possi-ble, monetizes the policy impacts 15 communityorganizations in Los Angeles County achieved withfoundation support. The National Committee forResponsive Philanthropy analyzed data on the organ-izing, advocacy and civic engagement these groupsundertook during a five year period (2004–2008).The research found impressive impacts. Collectively,the groups garnered more than $6.88 billion for mar-ginalized communities and achieved many equally sig-nificant nonmonetary benefits.L.A. County nonprofits and funders seeking long-term change for local communities face many obsta-cles because of the complex local and state politicalenvironments, sheer size of the region, incrediblydiverse population and longstanding disparities. Theinnovative organizing and advocacy strategies thatgrassroots organizations have developed and impactsthey have achieved thus are all the more impressive. Infact, L.A. community groups have pioneered manysuccessful policy models, such as community benefitsagreements, which ensure that development projectsinvolving public subsidies benefit affected neighbor-hoods. They have led the country in organizing youth,engaging voters, building multiethnic organizationsand creating broad coalitions that bring togetherlower-income communities, faith leaders, organizedlabor and environmental groups. Using these strategies and others, the groups hadsignificant accomplishments:> For impacts that could be monetized, the aggregatebenefit over five years was $6,886,534,758.> For every dollar invested in their advocacy, organiz-ing and civic engagement ($75.5 million total), thegroups garnered $91 in benefits for L.A. communi-ties.> Nonmonetary impacts also benefited thousands ofunderserved Angelenos. Examples include cleanerair, better working conditions, more balancedimmigration enforcement, greater student access tocollege-prep classes and more responsive servicesfor LGBTQ and limited English proficient residents. > Foundations and other institutional grantmakersprovided critical monetary, capacity building andconvening support to these efforts. Funders con-tributed $58 million, or 77 percent of all advocacyand organizing funding over five years.The organizations creatively engaged affected con-stituencies across the county. This engagement wasvaluable in its own right, helping marginalized groupsfind a voice in the democratic process. It also mar-shaled the people power needed to make change hap-pen. Data from 13 groups demonstrated the depth andbreath of engagement: collectively, they trained morethan 14,000 leaders, grew their membership by almost40,000 individuals and turned out close to 55,000people at public actions.NCRP found that both the quantity and the qualityof civic commitment were distinctive. Designing tai-lored leadership development programs; organizingacross race, ethnicity and language; using participato-ry research to organize youth; coordinating nonparti-san voter outreach and strategically responding to bal-lot initiatives were some of the innovative strategies thegroups employed. Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities 4NCRP also learned that coalitions were central tomany of the advocacy and organizing impacts.Building effective coalitions often is necessary but noteasy to do. The groups in the research sample sharedwhat works for them: building from organic and trust-ing relationships, developing clearly articulated goalsand strategies, fostering inclusive leadership and aprocess for handling disagreement and identifyingclear roles for each member of the coalition. Grantmakers were critical to the success of theseorganizations, helping them build their capacity overmany years to get to the point where they could workon the geographically dispersed local level, as well asstatewide and even nationally. A small proportion oflocal philanthropies supported these groups, as well asmany national and state level funders. The findings suggest that if more local foundationswere to support advocacy and organizing, communi-ties could achieve even greater impact. The regioncontinues to face many urgent issues in areas such asimmigrant rights, education, health, housing, low-wage work, LGBTQ rights and environmental justice.There is much to be done. NCRP encourages nonprof-its and funders to use this report to educate othersabout the ways philanthropists can leverage their grantdollars for significant community benefit.For foundations to maximize their impact, NCRPrecommends that funders:1. Increase the percentage of grant dollars devoted toadvocacy, organizing and civic engagement. Somefunders already recognize the significant returnoffered by investing in policy advocacy and organ-izing, and devote a substantial percentage of theirgrant dollars to this work. If other funders increasethe proportion of their grant dollars devoted to thesestrategies, they will increase the capacity of under-served communities to engage in participatorydemocracy and contribute to solving the region’spressing problems.2. Engage the board and donors in dialogue abouthow advocacy and organizing can help achievelong-term goals. Sharing concrete examples fromthis report with trustees and/or major donors canhelp demystify advocacy and organizing, andencourage discussion of how these strategies can beamong a variety of approaches needed to achievechange on the issues funders care about.3. Support collaboration that strengthens advocacyand organizing. Exemplary grantmakers can helpbuild the case for policy change by lending theirexpertise and resources to collaboration thatstrengthens the advocacy and organizing work oftheir nonprofit partners.4. Work together to foster philanthropic cooperationand shared learning. Los Angeles-based funderswill see better results if they communicate witheach other and with statewide and national fundersto leverage their resources effectively to address thepressing issues facing L.A. County.5. Invest in organizational capacity and a nonprofitadvocacy infrastructure for Southern California.This report features a cross-section of highly sophis-ticated advocacy and grassroots groups in L.A.County. None of the groups in the sample achievedtheir current size and scope overnight; it took time,experience and investments in organizationalcapacity. L.A. County is home to many nascentorganizations with great potential, and foundationswould be wise to help develop those organizationsby investing in their capacity and in a nonprofitadvocacy infrastructure for Southern California.6. Provide general operating support and multi-yeargrants. As nonprofits balance the immediate basicneeds of their constituents with their advocacy andorganizing work, their funding partners can be ofgreatest help by investing in a way that enablesthem to achieve the highest possible impact.National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy5II. Definition of TermsADVOCACY: Advocacy is the act of promoting acause, idea or policy to influence people’s opinions oractions on matters of public policy or concern. Manytypes of activities fall under the category of “advocacy”and are legally permissible for 501(c)(3) public chari-ties to engage in, such as: issue identification, researchand analysis; public issue education; lobbying for oragainst legislation; nonpartisan voter registration, edu-cation and mobilization; litigation; educating govern-ment agencies at all levels; participation in referendaand ballot initiatives; grassroots mobilization; and tes-tifying before government bodies. There are no legallimits on how much non-lobbying advocacy a non-profit organization can undertake.CIVIC ENGAGEMENT: In broad terms, civic engage-ment or civic participation encompasses any and allactivities that engage ordinary people in civic life,including through community organizing, advocacy,and voter registration, education and mobilization. Itoften involves building the skills, knowledge and expe-rience that enable people to participate effectively inthe democratic process.COMMUNITY ORGANIZING: Community organiz-ing is a process of building relationships, leadershipand power, typically among disenfranchised commu-nities, and bringing that power and collective voice tobear on the issues that affect those communities byengaging with relevant decision-makers. The issuesraised, solutions identified and strategies developed toachieve those solutions all are defined and acted on bythe leaders themselves, usually with help from profes-sional organizers. Community organizing can be onepart of an overall advocacy or public policy campaignstrategy, but it is distinguished by the fact that affectedconstituencies are the agents of change, rather thanpaid advocates or lobbyists who represent the interestsof such constituencies.IMPACT:1 Impact refers to long-term or aggregatechange, a desired end result. For example: Low-wageworkers’ incomes were raised as a result of a minimumwage increase. An outcome is the short-term changeor result that a program or initiative produces. Severaloutcomes can contribute to an impact. For example:Minimum wage legislation was passed in the legisla-ture. An output is the tangible product that results froma program’s activities. For example: Twenty organiza-tions endorsed the minimum wage proposal; the mini-mum wage proposal was introduced in the Senate; akey legislator received 500 calls and letters from con-stituents favoring this proposal.LOBBYING: Lobbying generally is defined as anattempt to influence, directly or indirectly, the passageor defeat of government legislation. Lobbying can beone part of an advocacy strategy, but advocacy doesnot necessarily have to involve lobbying. This is a crit-ical distinction. Nonprofits can lobby legally. Federallaws determine how much lobbying a nonprofit organ-ization can undertake, but there are no limits on howmuch non-lobbying advocacy (described above) anonprofit can engage in. NCRP maintains on its website a resource list including legal rules and definitionsfor nonprofit lobbying (see www.ncrp.org/campaigns-research-policy/communities/gcip/gcip-resources).Alliance for Justice has compiled web-based state lawresources on campaign finance and ballot measures,lobbying and voter registration issues. These resourcesStrengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities 6National Committee for Responsive Philanthropyare available for free to nonprofit organizations athttp://www.afj.org/for-nonprofits-foundations/state-resources. “MARGINALIZED” COMMUNITIES: The phrase“marginalized communities” refers broadly to groupsthat have been underrepresented or denied a voice indecisions that affect their lives, or have experienceddiscrimination. Groups include but are not limited to:lower-income people; racial and ethnic minorities;women; immigrants; refugees; workers; lesbian, gay,bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) indi-viduals; people with disabilities; rural; HIV positive;prisoners and formerly incarcerated; and single-parentfamilies.7III. Research OverviewNCRP used a methodology developed specificallyfor the Grantmaking for Community ImpactProject to measure the impacts of advocacy, organizingand civic engagement among a sample of 15 organiza-tions in Los Angeles County over a five-year timeframefrom 2004–2008.    First, NCRP identified potential community organi-zations to be researched in the county by gatheringsuggestions from nonprofit, foundation and other com-munity leaders. After a complete list was generated,2NCRP considered organizations that met the followingcriteria:> Have been in existence for at least five years> Have at least one full-time staff person or equivalentdevoted to advocacy or organizing> Focus on a core constituency of lower-income peo-ple, people of color, or other marginalized groups,broadly defined> Work on a local level (may also work regionally,statewide or nationally)> Have the capacity to provide data for the researchWhile many new or short-lived groups may engagein advocacy or organizing campaigns, the five-yearthreshold acknowledges the long-term nature of sys-tems change and the time horizon for being able toshow measurable impact. Likewise, many nonprofitsproduce heroic results with very limited staff, but can-not advance sustainable social change without ade-quate resources. This project aims to drive moreresources to the necessary and impactful strategies ofadvocacy, organizing and civic engagement, ratherthan romanticize scarcity. Finally, a focus on marginal-ized groups reflects NCRP’s mission to promote philan-thropy that serves the public good, supports nonprofiteffectiveness and responds to those in our society withthe least wealth, opportunity and power.Through this process, NCRP research staff devel-oped a sample that reflects the diverse constituenciesin the county, a broad range of issues, and a mix ofapproaches to advocacy and organizing. The following15 organizations participated in the project:1. Asian Pacific American Legal Center (APALC)2. Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of LosAngeles (CHIRLA)3. Community Coalition for Substance AbusePrevention and Treatment 4. Communities for a Better Environment (CBE)5. InnerCity Struggle (ICS)6. Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA)7. Labor Community Strategy Center/Bus RidersUnion (LCSC/BRU)8. L.A. Voice PICO9. Los Angeles ACORN 10. Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy(LAANE)11. Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community ServiceCenter12. Los Angeles Metropolitan Churches (LAM)13. People Organized for Westside Renewal(POWER)14. South Asian Network (SAN)15. Strategic Concepts in Organizing and PolicyEducation (SCOPE)A brief description of each organization and contactinformation is included in Appendix A. Many otherorganizations, working with similar or other marginal-ized communities, also met the research criteria,Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities 8engaging in advocacy, organizing and civic engage-ment throughout the county and achieving significantimpacts as well. This report is intended to be illustra-tive rather than exhaustive in its scope.NCRP researchers collected data from all 15 organ-izations by interviewing senior staff from each group inperson (one by telephone) and then collecting writtenresponses to a detailed questionnaire. Several organiza-tions also provided supplemental materials, such asnews clippings, brochures, campaign materials, budg-ets and grant reports. NCRP gathered data from the five-year period 2004–2008 for the following measures:> Advocacy and organizing impacts. Where possible,groups included the dollar value of policy changes(e.g., income gained from expanded job opportuni-ties, increased funds for transit, affordable housinginvestments) and the number of constituents bene-fiting from the changes, as well as strategies andfactors contributing to success.> Civic engagement indicators. For example, thenumber of leaders trained and people mobilized tocommunicate with policymakers.> Interim progress and capacity-building indicators.For example, changes in leaders’ skills and accessto the policy process.> Amounts and types of funding the groups received foradvocacy, organizing and civic engagement duringthe five years, examples of positive funder partner-ships, and obstacles they faced in seeking funding.NCRP research staff verified the impacts to ensurethat the dollar amounts and number of beneficiariesestimated by groups, as well as the groups’ role in thewins, were accurate. NCRP consulted with public offi-cials, researchers and other experts, and examinedsource materials such as newspaper articles and statebudget documents.3Examples of monetary impact include one-time ormulti-year state appropriations for a program, the valueof a programmatic budget cut that was averted andincreased wages to workers through a minimum wageincrease. For wins that have a verifiable ongoing eco-nomic impact into the future (such as recurring appro-priations or a wage increase), the value was calculatedthrough 2011. This method gives organizations creditfor impacts that extend well beyond the five-year studyperiod. Also, impacts or wins for which the work wasdone in the study period are included, even if theimpact was implemented after 2008. For example, if acoalition of groups worked on an issue through 2008but the benefit was seen in 2009 and beyond, it isincluded. No work initiated after 2008 is included inthe ROI analysis, although in a few cases they arementioned in the report. These data were aggregated to determine the totalmonetary benefits of all the wins that could be quanti-fied. Financial data were aggregated to determine thetotal amount invested by foundations and other sourcesto support advocacy and organizing across the groups. A return on investment (ROI) calculation was madeusing the following formula:The ROI shows how collective financial support bygrantmakers and other funding sources for a set oforganizing and advocacy groups in a location overtime has contributed to the collective policy impacts ofthese groups. It would be almost impossible to attrib-ute a specific policy change to a particular group orgrant. The use of an aggregate ROI helps focus the find-ings on the investment that all of the organizations andtheir supporters together have made that contributed tosuccess. Unless otherwise noted, every monetary fig-ure attached to an impact and cited in the report isincluded in the ROI. See Appendix B for a detailed list-ing of monetized impacts and the calculation of dollarimpact for the total ROI.The ROI is not intended to be a precise figure but toprovide a solid basis for understanding the extent ofsubstantial benefit for communities in L.A. Countyfrom investments in nonprofits that use advocacy andorganizing to achieve long-term, systemic change. Itdoes not capture every input that contributed to thesesuccesses. For example, there were many coalitionefforts in which groups not featured in this report par-ticipated, and their financial information is not reflect-ed in the ROI. However, for the impacts that areincluded, one or more of the 15 sample groups playeda significant or lead role in achieving the victory.Often, even small local groups working in broad coali-tions can make the difference because of their strategicrelationship to legislators, knowledge about and con-nection to those most affected by a public policy andability to mobilize constituents to influence decisionmakers. Additionally, a large proportion of the impactswere not quantifiable, making the ROI an underesti-mate of the benefits actually achieved. Appendix CNational Committee for Responsive Philanthropyaggregate dollar amount of all winsaggregate dollars invested in advocacy and organizing   ROI = 9contains a detailed listing of these equally importantnonquantified impacts.In addition to measuring policy impact and, wherepossible, monetizing that impact, the methodologycollects rich qualitative information about how thegroups achieve change and how they engage residentsand other stakeholders in the process. Civic engage-ment that strengthens community cohesion and buildsbridges across race, language and other dividesdemonstrates another kind of impact. The rise of acommunity leader to become a public official is itselfan organizing accomplishment that also aids theachievement of policy outcomes. The methodologyattempts to capture these many layers of impactthrough both numbers and stories.Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities 10National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyIn many ways, Los Angeles County is unique. Its demo-graphic diversity, vast geography, layered politicalenvironment and atypical economy combine to makeL.A. a place of opportunity as well as challenge. Thevibrant and growing nonprofit and philanthropic sec-tors have been at the cutting edge of many innovativestrategies that respond to issues the rest of the countryis just starting to address. L.A. County offers rich learn-ing opportunities for other metropolitan areas that aregrappling with economic shifts, new migration, globalwarming and other twenty-first century issues. This briefoverview provides important context for understandingthe environment in which philanthropic giving andnonprofit advocacy and civic engagement happen, andwhat it takes for them to succeed.    A. DEMOGRAPHICSL.A. County is large, sprawling and diverse. Made upof 88 cities and numerous unincorporated areas, L.A.County is approximately the size of Connecticut.4 Themost populous county in California, it is home to 9.9million people, according to the 2008 Census. If thecounty were a state, its population would make it theeighth largest state in the country, just behind Ohioand ahead of Michigan.5Notably, the county is divided geographically byracial and ethnic makeup. In A Tale of Two Cities, theUnited Way of Greater Los Angeles reports that ethnicenclaves run the risk of becoming “isolated culturaland linguistic islands, resistant to interaction withother groups.”9 The UCLA School of Public Affairs’2008 report, The State of South LA, found that a major-ity of the white population lives in coastal neighbor-hoods and wealthier inland communities, such asBeverly Hills and the San Fernando Valley. Latinosmake up a majority of eastern South L.A. and live inand east of downtown L.A., as well as in the north,near Van Nuys. The African American population com-prises a majority of the western portion of South L.A.and the part of the county just south of South L.A.10L.A. County’s sheer geographic scale, segregation andjuxtaposition of sprawling suburbs with dense urbanneighborhoods makes organizing communities andadvocating for policy change more challenging than inmost metro regions across the country.The regional economy benefits from tourism, hospi-tals, universities and, of course, the one industry thatthe world most associates with L.A.: film and entertain-ment.11 L.A. County also is the largest manufacturing11IV. Los Angeles SocioeconomicConditions and PhilanthropicGivingStrengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesDemographic Snapshot> 47.3 percent of the county is Latino, 29.1 percentwhite, 13.2 percent Asian, and 9.5 percent AfricanAmerican. > 36.2 percent of the county’s population is foreign-born.6> 54.1 percent of county residents speak a languageother than English at home, more than 35 percentagepoints higher than the national average.7> Roughly one million undocumented immigrants live inthe L.A. metropolitan area, almost twice the numberliving in any other metropolitan area in the country. > Two-thirds of the county’s children have immigrantparents, 19 percent of whom have parents that areundocumented, although a majority are themselvesAmerican citizens.8center in the U.S., employing more than 375,000workers in 2007.12 With numerous ports that dot thecounty’s coast and an international airport, internation-al trade is flourishing in L.A. County. The county’s mostrecent industrial boom has been driven by technology— digital information technology, environmental tech-nology and biotechnology research.13 This variety ofeconomic engines is a boon for the region. B. DISPARITIESAs community leaders seek to address the poor wagesand environmental impact often associated with tradeand some local industries, many wonder if theseengines equally benefit all residents of Los AngelesCounty. L.A. is home to significant disparities—inwealth and income, education, housing and exposureto environmental toxins. These various disparities havebeen a central focus of many nonprofits and funders inthe region, as this report demonstrates. While L.A. County is home to the largest number ofmillionaires in the United States, it also is one of themost poverty-stricken counties in the nation: 14.6 per-cent of the population14 and 21 percent of the county’schildren live below the poverty line.15 Mark Vallianatos,the policy director of the Urban and EnvironmentalPolicy Institute, estimated “the wealthiest 50 individu-als in L.A. County have approximately twice the networth of the bottom 60 percent of the population.”16Parents and students are fighting the large educationdisparity in the county. Said one leader, “Look at SouthCentral [L.A.], African American and Latino studentsare receiving a poor education. You go to Beverly Hills[and see] predominantly white schools where 90 per-cent of their class is going to college and 99 percent isgraduating. Out here it’s like 50 percent — and noteven, sometimes — is graduating, [and] not even half ofthat is going to college.”17 School districts in lower-income areas struggle to find and keep credentialedteachers, supply students with textbooks and even pro-vide adequate classrooms. Students also lack necessarycollege preparatory classes.18 The Los Angeles UnifiedSchool District (LAUSD), the largest district in the coun-ty and second largest in the nation, spends $4,370 perpupil each year,19 about half the national average.20Twenty-seven percent of seniors in the LAUSD Class of2008 did not graduate with their class.21Population growth in L.A. County, governmentbudget cuts and the high demand for luxury housinghave contributed to an affordable housing crisis.According to L.A. Weekly, L.A. now ranks 49th out ofAmerica’s 50 largest cities for affordable housing.22 Infact, the cost of renting in the county is now 43 percenthigher than it was eight years ago. Of the10,000–14,000 housing units being built each year,only about 330 are affordable options. Additionally,the county is rapidly losing what little affordable hous-ing it still has. In three years, 7,369 affordable housingunits were converted into luxury housing and 13,713rent controlled units were lost between 2001 and2007. In the face of this growing emergency, the city ofL.A. received a 78 percent budget cut to its AffordableHousing Trust Fund.23Lower-income populations and people of color aremore negatively affected by what a recent report calls“the climate gap.”24 Despite gradual improvements,L.A. County remains the most smog-polluted region inthe country. The county’s ports and adjacent neighbor-hoods are the site of heavy vehicle traffic, includingfreight movement by diesel trucks. The county’s popu-lation growth and its historic lack of adequate publictransportation have caused an explosion of vehicles onthe road.25 Lower-income communities living in closeproximity to ports and industrial sites are overlyexposed to pollution and suffer its health effects dis-proportionately.26 This has not gone unnoticed byadvocates and government officials who for years havebeen dedicated to reducing pollution and diminishingits impact on affected residents. Los Angeles mayorAntonio Villaraigosa has pledged to make L.A. a greencity.27 Nonprofits often adopt advocacy, organizingand civic engagement strategies as ways to counterpersistent disparities like those highlighted here.C. GOVERNANCE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENTIt is important to understand the unique local and stategovernment structures that can make policy advocacyharder to undertake than in other places. At the locallevel, advocates and organizers may have to navigatethe bureaucracies and legislative bodies for up to 88 dif-ferent cities as well as the countywide government. TheL.A. city police department and L.A. County sheriff’sdepartment each have their own law enforcementresponsibilities. The ports of Los Angeles and LongBeach adjoin each other but are governed by separateauthorities. Some regional entities have jurisdiction overa broader area of southern California. The South CoastAir Quality Management District (AQMD) is the air pol-lution control agency for all of Orange County and the12National Committee for Responsive Philanthropyurban portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and SanBernardino counties. One advocate observed that in thisfractious political environment, no one governmententity or individual takes a region-wide view of issues. Despite these challenges, or perhaps because ofthem, based on our sample, local advocates appear tobe more involved in nonpartisan voter activities than inother study sites. Community leaders concluded that toeffect policy change they needed elected officials whoshared their vision for the region and were account-able to marginalized constituencies. The degree ofcoordination and sophistication on nonpartisan elec-toral work is notable and has paid off, with the electionof more diverse leadership from grassroots communi-ties to major positions of power. Karen Bass, foundingexecutive director of the Community Coalition, waselected to the California State Assembly in 2004. In2008, Bass made history as the first African Americanwoman in the country to serve as speaker of a stateassembly when she assumed that position inCalifornia. In 2005, Mexican American city council-man and former union organizer Antonio Villaraigosa,who also has served as state assembly speaker, becamethe first Latino mayor of L.A. since 1872. He wasreelected in 2009. Despite some supportive local political allies,organizers often are hamstrung by state politics, whichaffects access to resources locally. Many of the chal-lenges that groups in L.A. County are struggling toaddress, such as underfunding of education andhuman service programs, can be linked to the state’sbudget rules, which have been shaped by votersthrough ballot initiatives. Under California’s ballot sys-tem, the state’s constitution and/or state laws can bechanged, added to, or undone by the electorate.28Since the early twentieth century, the state has operat-ed under a budget rule that requires a two-thirdsmajority of legislators to adopt the state budget. In1979, Proposition 13 restricted property tax increasesand set a requirement of two-thirds majority in bothhouses to raise taxes as well, making it nearly impossi-ble to increase tax revenue despite increased spendingneeds.29 This voter initiative dealt a low blow toCalifornia’s underfunded education system, which tra-ditionally is financed by property taxes. In addition,Proposition 13 often is cited as the cause of the state’sbudget deficit, which climbed to $26.3 billion in 2009.Efforts to reduce the deficit have meant substantial cutsto already tight public spending, including safety netprograms that target lower-income populations.30According to community leaders, another state ballotinitiative with consequences for L.A. is Proposition 140,which introduced strict term limits in 1990. Assemblymembers may serve a maximum of six years in officeand senators may serve a maximum of eight.Community leaders have observed the impact of theselimits on their ability to engage in state-level policywork. It is difficult to build relationships with lawmakersand their staff; and, once relationships are built, theydon’t last. Assembly members often are looking towardtheir next job, and they do not have time to learn andinvest significant energy in detailed policy issues. Meanwhile, the California political system remainsmore gridlocked than that of almost any other statebecause of its structure. Either legislation doesn’t moveat all or laws flip-flop as those in power change fre-quently. The state repeatedly came to the brink of disas-ter in 2009 because the legislature and governor couldnot agree on a budget that would address massivedeficits. Meanwhile, money, often from outside thestate, pours in to sway the electorate on ballot ques-tions, with real repercussions for people’s lives. Forexample, more than $75 million was spent to supportor oppose Proposition 8, which overturned marriageequality.31 In response to what is perceived as a brokenpolitical system, community and philanthropic leadersare seeking major reform.

LOS ANGELES COUNTY’S NONPROFITSECTORThere are about 41,500 nonprofits registered in L.A.County, and the vast majority operate with very smallbudgets. According to a UCLA report, only 29 percent ofregistered 501(c)(3) organizations (9,641) filed an IRSForm 990 in 2007, i.e., had income of $25,000 or more.Of the filers, 42 percent (4,031) had revenues of less than$100,000. Overall, the sector has grown 77 percentsince 1995, but this growth has slowed recently and themedian and average size of nonprofits has declined. Sixpercent of L.A. County’s workforce is employed by thenonprofit sector, totaling 238,000 people.32L.A. County’s nonprofit sector strives to improve thequality of life for the county’s residents by providingcrucial social services, defending the rights of commu-nity members and encouraging civic engagement.Some of the most innovative program and policy ideas13Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities and constituent engagement techniques in the countryhave come from L.A. advocacy and organizing groups.One pivotal event, the 1992 civil unrest,33 is most fre-quently given credit for the revolution that took placein the local nonprofit sector. Several community organ-izations were founded as a result of the unrest andhave built tremendous capacity over the last twodecades. The civil disturbance also made groups real-ize they needed to do a better job of working together,organizing across race and ethnicity, and buildingbroad coalitions to effect change at the policy level.34This report includes many examples of such strategiesleading to significant impacts.Surveys conducted by the UCLA Center for CivilSociety indicate that the nonprofit sector is strained asa result of increased demand and decreased revenue.In addition to the economic downturn, nonprofits citethe state’s budget crisis as a cause of lost revenue andthe worsened conditions facing county residents.However, L.A. County’s nonprofit sector has proven tobe resilient, responding by increasing fundraising, con-trolling and cutting costs and increasing visibility.Consequently, organizations have been able torespond to the needs of their constituents; about one-third of survey respondents actually have increasedprogram expenditure.35 However, ongoing state budg-et crises and projected declines in foundation giving inthe region likely will strain nonprofits further.36In response to the current economic situation,UCLA authors recommended that nonprofits focusmore on program evaluation, collaborate to increaseefficiencies and engage in more widespread advocacy.“Nonprofits must move beyond the misperceptionsaround advocacy and the legal rules that limit lobby-ing activities. All nonprofits can engage in advocacywithout penalty, although the scope and extent ofactivities vary according to the tax exempt status of theorganization.” The authors added, “Depleted publiccoffers should not dissuade nonprofits from engagingwith elected officials and other lawmakers. Nonprofitvoices need to infiltrate the debates around health carereform, economic recovery and other social issues.”37E. THE PHILANTHROPIC LANDSCAPEIn 2007, the area’s 2,930 active private and communi-ty grantmaking foundations held assets of $42.7 billionand made grants of $2.1 billion.38 A youthful sector,about half of the county’s foundations were foundedwithin the past twenty years. Southern CaliforniaGrantmakers predicts that in the near future founda-tions will grow substantially in size, scope, and institu-tionalization.39As summarized by James M. Ferris, “[SouthernCalifornia] Grantmaking is fragmented, decentralizedand dispersed. At the same time, it tends to be dynam-ic, adaptive and innovative.”40 The sector’s assets arefairly concentrated; the top ten foundations accountfor 42 percent of giving. And yet, L.A. County founda-tions account for only 44 percent of the total grant dol-lars received by local nonprofits.41 Much of philan-thropic giving coming from L.A. County grantmakersleaves the area. Local giving from the entertainmentindustry also has dwindled, as corporations based inHollywood begin to expand their scope globally.42Thus the role of non-local foundations has been criti-cal in supporting philanthropic endeavors in theregion. Among the top 20 funders giving grants inmetro L.A. in 2007, several came from outsideCalifornia, including the Bill & Melinda Gates,Skirball, Andrew W. Mellon, Robert Wood Johnsonand Ford Foundations.43L.A. County philanthropies have responded adeptly tothe area’s changing landscape. After the 1992 civilunrest, a group of local foundations came together to cre-ate L.A. Urban Funders, which sought to address the eco-nomic disparities made visible by the protests. A collab-orative of more than 30 funders at its peak, LAUF provid-ed more than $30 million over its lifespan in both pooledand categorical grants in the Pacoima, Hyde Park andVermont/Manchester neighborhoods of Los Angeles.Seeing results around substance abuse, standardized testscores and land use, among other issues, LAUF becamea national model for funder collaboratives.In 2000, another successful collaboration emergedlocally when the Ford Foundation launched its Fundfor Community Organizing (FCO). FCO partnered witha local grantmaker in each of five sites across the coun-try to increase the success of organizing by fosteringgreater capacity, networking and philanthropicresources. Los Angeles was an FCO site, and theLiberty Hill Foundation was able to leverage supportfrom Ford and several California funders through itsFund for a New Los Angeles to support more than 20organizations over at least five years. The project eval-uation demonstrated that these philanthropic invest-ments in organizing yielded significant policy reformsbenefiting lower-income communities.44In 2008, the state’s largest foundations responded toconcerns among state legislators about the amount of14National Committee for Responsive Philanthropyfoundation resources going to organizations led by andserving people of color and other disadvantaged pop-ulations. Ten California foundations formed theFoundation Coalition to “develop a new set of grant-making activities that would focus on the needs ofminority-led and other small grassroots nonprofits thatserve minority populations and other low-incomecommunities.”45 The Liberty Hill Foundation is partner-ing with The California Endowment, WeingartFoundation and California Wellness Foundation toassist in regranting and capacity building for minority-led organizations in L.A. L.A. County grantmakers have the immense poten-tial to become national leaders in advocacy-relatedgiving. L.A. communities benefit from the policy lead-ership of statewide foundations, as well. A 2008 reporton public policy funding, commissioned by the JamesIrvine Foundation, said that “achieving large-scale andlasting results for individuals or communities – a goallinked to many foundation missions – typically cannotbe accomplished with private resources alone. Often,it requires public investments and government direc-tives.”46 The report recognized The CaliforniaEndowment and the David and Lucile PackardFoundation for their leadership in advocacy-relatedgrantmaking. The previous discussion on the social, political,nonprofit, philanthropic and policy landscape of LosAngeles County provides valuable context for thisreport. The impacts described in the following sectionsare all the more impressive given the challenging envi-ronment in which funders and nonprofits must operate. 15Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities 16National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy17V. FindingsA. RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND AGGREGATEBENEFITSThe research shows that nonprofits engaged inadvocacy, organizing and civic engagement havecontributed significant benefits to Los AngelesCounty communities. Groups were asked to listtheir top five most impactful accomplishments. Atleast 45 separate impacts were verified, of whichat least 25 were able to be monetized. Theseimpacts directly benefit tens of thousands of work-ers, families, public school students, immigrants,transit users, LGBTQ residents and other histori-cally vulnerable groups. Major impacts werefound across numerous issues, including econom-ic security, housing, transit, health care, educationand civil rights. Overall, the numbers show that:> The total amount spent on advocacy and organiz-ing across the 15 groups from 2004 to 2008 was$75.5 million> Of that amount, $58 million was contributed byfoundations, comprising 77 percent of all supportfor advocacy and organizing.> The total dollar amount of quantifiable benefitsachieved during the five-year period was$6,886,534,758.> The return on investment, which is total dollarvalue of impacts divided by total spent for advoca-cy and organizing, is 91.Thus, for every dollar invested in the advocacy,organizing and civic engagement activities of 15groups collectively, there was $91 in benefits to LosAngeles County communities.The ROI is intended to be illustrative, notexhaustive. It does not capture all possible inputs,such as the funds spent by coalition partners not inthe survey sample. On the other hand, many signif-icant impacts simply could not be quantified, mak-ing this ROI a conservative figure. For example, it isimpossible to quantify the benefit to society ofengaging constituents, particularly those previouslydisenfranchised, in the life of their community, orthe payoff for children who fulfill their potential bygaining access to high-quality educational andother opportunities. Further, the ROI does not cap-ture economic ripple effects of impacts. For exam-ple, increases in wages likely have a multipliereffect as those earnings are recirculated in the localeconomy. Also, NCRP conservatively estimated thevalue of one impact, the statewide minimum wageincrease, by valuing only the proportion benefitingworkers in L.A. County. Had the full value beenincluded, the ROI would have been $90 higher, oralmost doubled. NCRP conservatively estimated long-term bene-fits for recurring or ongoing impacts through 2011,three years beyond the time period studied. Severalof the victories will benefit communities wellbeyond that year. Thus, the ROI would be signifi-cantly higher if those estimates were longer term.Finally, most of the groups are in the midst of long-term efforts still being fought. They may have hadpartial victories and made interim progress in meas-urable ways. The investments made by foundationsbetween 2004 and 2008 will reap future rewardsthat cannot be quantified at present. If more founda-tions invest resources in advocacy, organizing andcivic engagement, no doubt the benefits to LosAngeles will be even greater.Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities 18B. IMPACTS BY ISSUEThe 15 featured organizations focused their organizingand advocacy efforts on a range of issues at the local,state and national levels. This section and the next twoon civic engagement and coalitions together offer arich sense of what it took for the groups to makechange. Unlike any other site studied for this project,L.A. County has unique circumstances that demandedinnovative approaches and significant scale. The 15groups adapted to these local and state challenges toachieve impressive impacts – some easily monetizedand others not – all of which are important for the vul-nerable communities they engage and represent. Theyused a variety of effective strategies, such as directaction, town hall meetings, relationship-building withlegislators, lawsuits, media campaigns and research.Following are many of the highlights of these success-ful efforts. Appendices B and C summarize all of theverified victories the community groups reported. Thegroups surely define their own impact well beyond apolicy win – to the civic engagement and leadershipdevelopment of marginalized constituencies.Examples of these achievements are in the subsequentsection, and throughout the next few sections, oneinnovative or distinctive aspect of each organization’swork is highlighted in a text box.1. Economic SecurityLiving Wages – Nationally, ACORN has been a leader onliving wage policies, and its Living Wage Resource Centerhas provided strategic advice to dozens of campaignsacross the country. L.A. ACORN helped build a labor-community coalition to increase the California minimumwage by $1.25 to $8 per hour, effective January 2008.California now is one of only 14 states whose minimumwage exceeds the federal level. According to theUniversity of California, Berkeley, Institute of IndustrialRelations, this wage increase benefits 1.65 millionCalifornia workers directly and another 700,000 workersindirectly. The additional wages going to L.A. Countyworkers are estimated at $2.64 billion over four years.L.A. ACORN organized a large labor–community marchin support of the bill, which Governor Schwarzeneggersigned into law surrounded by members of ACORN andlocal unions, at the Mercado la Paloma building, whereACORN’s office was located. In 2008, the Los Angeles Alliance for a NewEconomy (LAANE) united with civil rights organiza-tions such as the NAACP and the Southern ChristianLeadership Conference of L.A. to win improved wagesand benefits totaling $96,600,000 for 4,000 securityguards, most of whom are African American. The sameyear, LAANE’s campaign with faith and ex-offendergroups won its first Construction Careers Policythrough the Community Redevelopment Agency,which will target $49 million in construction jobs fordisadvantaged workers. Previously, in 2006, LAANEformed the Coalition for a New Century and won pas-sage of the LAX Enhancement Zone Living WageOrdinance, which requires hotels near Los AngelesInternational Airport (LAX) to provide living wages andboth compensated and uncompensated days off forhotel workers. Also, the coalition helped negotiate col-lective bargaining agreements for workers at fourhotels. Because of litigation by hotel owners, the ordi-nance was not implemented until July 2008. As manyas 3,000 workers are covered by the living wage ordi-nance and new union contracts, which have generatedat least $18.5 million in added direct wages and ben-efits. The ripple effects of the agreement could add$4.5 million to the local economy.

Taxi Workers – Over the last three decades, L.A. taxiworkers have tried repeatedly to organize for betterwages and working conditions, without success.However, since 2005, they have achieved several vic-tories against very tough odds, in large part because ofthe organizing support they got from the South AsianNetwork (SAN) and legal support from public interestattorneys, including Julie Su at the Asian PacificAmerican Legal Center (APALC) and Betty Hung at theInner City Law Center. In the last five years, SAN,APALC and their partners have worked closely withtaxi workers themselves to create the L.A. Taxi WorkersAlliance (LATWA), which today has the signed supportof 1,400 cabbies from as many as 47 different coun-tries. LATWA has secured three meter fare increasesand won a minimum airport fare of $15 for short tripsto nearby hotels and beach cities. Public interestlawyers surveyed cab drivers in 2006 and determinedthat the changes added at least $19 million per year inincome for thousands of taxi workers.47 LATWA hastaken on the abysmal conditions at the Los AngelesInternational Airport taxi holding facilities, where driv-ers frequently are denied due process by the contrac-tor and denied access to working at the airport withoutan opportunity to defend themselves.  LATWA has wonbetter adherence to due process rights and less harass-ment of workers, clean bathrooms, benches in shadedareas and a water fountain away from the restroom.LATWA also persuaded the city council to demand thatthe airport improve holding lot conditions or else endthe current contract and seek competitive bids. LATWAhas connected with taxi worker organizing efforts inNew York, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and SanFrancisco to achieve even broader policy changes thatwill address the common challenges of taxi workersnationwide.Supermarket Workers – KIWA took on Assi Market,owned by the Rhee Brothers’ transnational food corpo-ration, and helped 100 workers in its L.A. store under-take a long campaign to improve working conditions.KIWA found that many Korean American and Latinoworkers were not paid overtime, were denied restbreaks, yelled at and mistreated by management.KIWA tried to organize the workers into a union, andwhen they lost by a slim margin in 2002, Assi retaliat-ed by firing half the workers. A law firm filed a class-action suit on behalf of the workers, and KIWA begana community-wide boycott of the market, drawingthousands of supporters to picket lines over the courseof the campaign. In 2007, a judge ruled in favor of theworkers and awarded them $1.475 million in dam-ages. Simultaneously, KIWA organized workers in anumber of supermarket chains, resulting in living wageagreements with five supermarkets, benefiting hun-dreds of workers. The HK and Galleria Supermarketsagreed to raise wages and also give raises annuallyaccording to the consumer price index. CaliforniaSupermarket agreed to pay at least one dollar per hourabove the minimum wage in a landmark case in whicha living wage was tied to a land-use permit and one ofthe few instances in which a living wage was negotiat-ed with a strictly private sector entity with no publicsubsidies involved. According to KIWA’s executivedirector, Danny Park, “These are not mom-and-popstores. Assi is the largest wholesaler and retailer of19Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesMembers of the L.A. Taxi Workers Alliance during a demonstration. Photocourtesy of APALCKOREATOWN IMMIGRANT WORKERS ALLIANCE (KIWA) has united Korean, Mexican and Central American workers tofight for their rights in several sectors of the local economy. First, KIWA tackled conditions at Korean restaurants, which wereignoring federal and state labor laws in their treatment of workers, including failing to pay the minimum and overtime wages.Through a worker organizing and public education campaign that targeted several restaurants and raised awareness amongthe Korean American community, KIWA shifted practice, raising the percentage of Koreatown restaurants abiding by laborlaws from 3 percent to 50 percent by the end of the campaign.Asian foods on the continent, employs over a thousandpeople nationwide and makes hundreds of millionsannually in gross revenues. The very least they can dois pay living wages to the workers. Some of that moneyshould circulate within Koreatown.” Green Jobs – Strategic Concepts in Organizing andPolicy Education (SCOPE), formerly Action forGrassroots Empowerment and Neighborhood Develop-ment Alternatives (AGENDA), has a long history ofbuilding coalitions that shape workforce and econom-ic development in Los Angeles. During the late 1990s,SCOPE led successful efforts to channel entertainmentindustry investments and welfare-to-work dollarstoward jobs and training for lower-income residents. In2006, SCOPE convened the Los Angeles ApolloAlliance, a broad coalition of 25 environmental andeconomic justice organizations, labor unions and busi-nesses to help shape an equitable green economy inL.A. The coalition includes other organizations fea-tured in this report, such as the Community Coalition,Communities for a Better Environment, and LAANE.The alliance worked with City Councilmember Herb J.Wesson Jr. to introduce and pass the Municipal GreenBuilding Retrofit and Workforce DevelopmentOrdinance. Over three years, SCOPE galvanized com-munity support for green jobs, with grassroots mem-bers going door to door, engaging residents about theneed for green jobs as a way to address both the envi-ronment and poverty, collecting thousands of surveys,sending postcards and making phone calls to electedofficials. The ordinance, adopted in April 2009, com-mitted the city to retrofit all city-owned buildings larg-er than 7,500 square feet or built before 1978 to bemore energy efficient. The priority will be buildingsthat are located in or benefit lower-income communi-ties, such as libraries and recreation centers. The ordi-nance established an advisory council and task forceto create new green jobs and training opportunities. In2010, SCOPE and the alliance will ensure that theordinance is implemented and benefits low-incomecommunities. SCOPE will monitor and provide over-sight in the development of a green Career LadderTraining Program that offers a pipeline for entry levelworkers into green careers. The city has garnered fed-eral and state resources for implementation, includingnearly $6 million for job training and $16 million forconstruction.Ex-Offender Employment – Los Angeles MetropolitanChurches (LAM) has worked with ex-offender groupssuch as Ex-Offender Action Network (EAN), Mums theWord Legal Services and Friends Outside-L.A.,employers and political leaders at all levels of govern-ment to address a looming crisis – the increasing num-bers of state prisoners being released with inadequateservices and few jobs waiting for them when theyreturn to their communities. In 2007, LAM ExecutiveDirector Cheryl Branch led a team of communityorganizers and faith-based leaders in partnership withthe City of L.A. to win a $1.2 million grant from theCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitationfor the Re-Entry Employment Options Demonstrationproject. During the 29-month program, the faith andpublic/private partnership integrated employment serv-ices, substance abuse and mental health treatmentservices, legal education, financial literacy, counselingand housing services within South L.A. to reducerecidivism. The program resulted in 43 ex-offendersfinding long-term jobs, enrolling in college or tradeschool or actively seeking employment. This was thefirst step toward the city creating a formal mechanismto support returning ex-offenders with employmentand other services. The program helped inform the Cityof L.A. Workforce Development System and itsWorkSource centers parolee services. Susan Quigly ofthe L.A. Community Development Department Ex-Offender Program emphasized LAM’s role in creatingthe bridge that allowed Workforce Development tobegin to serve ex-offenders: “Being a community-based organization, they had the connection to the ex-offender population and brought their expertise to thepartnership, allowing us to extend and expand our ex-offender work.” Workforce Development now has anInternet-based training module for staff working with20National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropySCOPE members rally support for their green jobs plan. Photo courtesy ofSCOPE21ex-offenders in order to expand its ability to provideservices for this population. Said Jaime Pacheco-Orozco of Workforce Development: “We have not tra-ditionally served the ex-offender population. The part-nership with LAM has been instrumental to serving thatpopulation, and it has helped lend legitimacy to theagency, that we are responding to community needs.”Housing and Homelessness – L.A. Voice is part of thePICO National Network (People ImprovingCommunities Through Organizing), a faith-basedorganizing network that has developed communityleaders in 150 cities and 18 states, engaging more than1,000 religious congregations, schools and neighbor-hood organizations. According to L.A. Voice,Hollywood has the second-largest concentration ofhomeless persons in L.A. In March 2006, L.A. Voiceheld a town hall meeting with 200 residents and mem-bers of the city council to seek solutions, and securedthe Community Redevelopment Agency’s commitmentto acquire land for development of a permanent sup-portive housing facility in Hollywood. In October2006, the CRA purchased a site for $1.5 million anddedicated it to this development, which has an annualoperating budget of $4.5 million and provides servicesfor 14,000 homeless individuals annually and perma-nent housing with supportive services for at least 50people. Janet Kelly at People Assisting the Homeless(PATH) Partners, which runs the facility, noted that L.A.Voice “was very instrumental in getting CRA to pur-chase the land. They performed the groundwork tomeet with key stakeholders, organize a town hallmeeting, and initiated a conversation about securing alocation for affordable housing.” In the face of gentrification and the development ofnew luxury condominiums, People Organized forWest Side Renewal (POWER) used the state’s MelloAct48 to secure affordable housing set-asides inMarina Del Rey. POWER spearheaded a campaignthat resulted in a new affordable housing policy by theL.A. County Board of Supervisors in 2008. The ordi-nance requires all developers to set aside 15 percentof total units for affordable housing – 5 percent ofunits for very low-income families, 5 percent for low-income families and 5 percent for moderate incomefamilies. The ordinance covers both new developmentand the redevelopment of existing buildings.Beginning in 2005, POWER sought enforcement ofthe Mello Act in other coastal areas regulated by thelaw, where developers routinely tried to appeal theiraffordable housing requirements. The organizationcreated “Team America,” which was a small group ofPOWER leaders and key staff from the offices ofCouncilmen Bill Rosendahl and Ed Reyes. TeamAmerica met bimonthly for three years to reviewupcoming developments that would be subject toMello Act requirements and ensure that developerswould not try to skirt their affordable housing obliga-tion under the act. This meant POWER leaders need-ed to organize on a development-by-developmentbasis to ensure that the community received its fairshare of affordable housing under the interim guid-ance for Mello Act enforcement in the City of LosAngeles. This diligent work paid off. In both L.A. andMarina Del Rey, POWER has worked with publicinterest attorneys to ensure that 134 units of affordablehousing were built through Mello Act compliance, avictory valued at $53.6 million.Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesLOS ANGELES METROPOLITAN CHURCHES (LAM), anetwork of African American churches formed after the1992 civil unrest, has long fought for improved servic-es for ex-offenders returning to the community. Manyreceive no support, resulting in a high recidivism rate.Said LAM Executive Director Cheryl Branch, “At LAM,we believe that even without explicit forms of discrimi-nation based on race or criminal record, today thestructures of employment, personal networks, housingand incarceration lead to social isolation and lack ofaccess to jobs.” LAM has worked closely with the Cityof Los Angeles and the State Corrections Department todevelop plans to support returning ex-offenders andimprove community safety.PEOPLE ORGANIZED FOR WEST SIDE RENEWAL(POWER), an organizing group affiliated with NationalPeople’s Action (NPA) whose membership includesindividual community members, community agenciesand tenant associations, has worked extensively onaffordable housing issues in Venice as well as the Cityand County of Los Angeles. With assistance from theLegal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and WesternCenter on Law and Poverty, POWER has both craftednew policy and effectively targeted enforcement ofunderutilized laws already on the books to both pre-serve existing affordable housing and seek set-asidesfor affordable units as part of new market rate construc-tion and redevelopment. 2. Land Use, Environment and TransportationCommunity Benefits – In 2004, LAANE and more than20 community, faith-based, labor and environmentalorganizations and schools formed the LAX Coalition forEconomic, Environmental and Educational Justice. Thecoalition sought to influence an $11 billion moderniza-tion plan for Los Angeles International Airport, to ensurethat this massive public investment would translate intoreal community benefits related to job training, residen-tial and school soundproofing and air quality mitigations.In one of LAANE’s first efforts helping to coordinate a“green-blue” alliance, it was aided by the clout of thelabor movement, evidenced by the appointment of thelate Miguel Contreras, then head of the L.A. CountyFederation of Labor, to the Airport Commission. LAANE’sexecutive director, Madeline Janis, noted, “The muscle ofthe labor movement was the linchpin. It convinced theenvironmental movement – the Environmental DefenseFund, the Coalition for Clean Air, the NRDC – to switchits approach from suing at the back end to helping comeup with solutions at the front end.”50 The coalition spenteight months negotiating the community benefits agree-ment (CBA) with the L.A. city council, which passed theagreement in December 2004. The value of the CBAcomponents totaled $500 million, benefiting roughly100,000 residents in communities east of the airportsuch as Inglewood and Lennox through noise abatementimprovements in the schools near the airport and air-quality improvements throughout the area.Transit – For the last several years, the Bus RidersUnion (BRU) has worked on implementation of theconsent decree and making sure the MetropolitanTransportation Authority (MTA) fulfilled its pledge toreplace 1,800 diesel buses with new ones that run oncleaner compressed natural gas (CNG). In 2005, theBRU convinced the MTA to streamline the applicationprocess for students to obtain discounted bus passes.The process previously required a paper applicationsigned by the school and mailed to MTA, a photo-graph, and a minimum three-week waiting period.According to Tammy Bang Luu, senior organizer at theLabor Community Strategy Center (LCSC), “This cum-bersome application process deterred thousands ofstudents from getting their passes – studies showed thatonly 25,000 out of almost one million eligible studentsactually had the pass.” Students had been forced to payas much as $30 to $70 more each month to get toschool. With easier access to the low-cost pass for all700,000 students in the LAUSD, as well as otherschool districts in the county and vocational colleges,this policy change is conservatively estimated to begenerating $58.75 million in savings per year for atleast 25,000 more families. Environmental Justice – For years, Communities fora Better Environment (CBE) has fought for monitor-22National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyDuring the 1990s, the LOS ANGELES ALLIANCE FORA NEW ECONOMY (LAANE) pioneered the conceptof community benefits agreements (CBAs). CBAs areagreements negotiated to ensure that commercialdevelopment projects involving public subsidies benefitaffected communities in myriad ways, such as accessto jobs. According to The American Prospect,“[LAANE’s] successes have inspired unions and com-munity organizations across the nation to their owncampaigns linking growth to justice … CBAs – whichnow may require developers not merely to providedecent jobs to local residents, but to build affordablehousing, parks, health clinics and other social ameni-ties – have been implemented on at least 48 majorprojects from Seattle to Miami.”49For almost two decades, the LABOR COMMUNITYSTRATEGY CENTER has been organizing bus riders toimprove public transit in Los Angeles. When it formedthe Bus Riders Union (BRU) in 1992, organizing transitriders was unheard of. The ripple effect of BRU’s suc-cesses reaches beyond individual local victories. TheBRU has contributed to a national movement, as seen inthe national Transit Riders for Public Transit movementand transit riders unions in many major cities, includingTucson, Boston and Atlanta. In October of 1996, theBRU won a landmark civil rights consent decree, follow-ing the class action civil rights lawsuit brought againstthe Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority(MTA) in 1994. The case, Labor Community StrategyCenter and Bus Riders Union et al. v. Los AngelesCounty Metropolitan Transportation Authority, wasbrought by the BRU and the NAACP Legal Defense andEducational Fund to challenge racial discrimination inthe transportation policies of the MTA. The consentdecree resulted in fare reductions, the reduction of busovercrowding and new service to major centers ofemployment, education and health care throughout thecounty – valued at $2.7 billion.ing, regulation and reduction of emissions in the oilrefineries. Julia May, a scientist at CBE, said, “Flaresare a large source of [toxic] emissions, but they arealso symbolic of the upset of daily life near a refin-ery with the flames going up into the air.” CBE foundhigh rates of asthma in communities such asWilmington that are near refineries. In 2005, CBEgot the South Coast Air Quality ManagementDistrict (AQMD) to amend Rule 1118, which willreduce emissions from flaring by 75 percent atseven refineries, one sulfur recovery plant and onehydrogen production plant. The tighter rule wentinto effect in 2007, and CBE projects sulfur-oxideemissions will go from 2 to 0.5 tons per day by2012. CBE is seeking to have this standard adoptednationally as well.CBE’s success in this campaign, which estab-lished a national precedent for these regulations,can be attributed in part to its three-prongedapproach to advocacy. Technical information fre-quently is inaccessible to community members, soCBE has researchers and scientists, who identifyspecific sources of pollution and ways to clean up;lawyers, who identify points of intervention in thelegal process; and community organizers, who helpresidents engage in the policy process. Mayexplained that it is rare to have an environmentalgroup with the technical skills to know what therules should be and the capacity to do organizing toget people to come to meetings. She observed that,as a scientist, “I can talk until I’m blue in the face,but the way to influence the process is having com-munity members there to push for changes. Andlawyers are there to enforce the people’s rights toclean air.” This strategy embodies CBE’s “trickle up”theory: you can get a lot done at the local levelwhere you have control and influence; then it canexpand to other communities.Through the Coalition for Clean & Safe Ports(CCSP), LAANE developed and won a Clean TrucksPrograms (CTP) for the Ports of Los Angeles andLong Beach. The CTP was designed to reduce theenvironmental footprint of port trucking, reduce theimpact of the industry on local communities andimprove conditions for the trucking workforce. Thedifferent policies were passed by the HarborCommissions of the respective cities, and in thecase of Los Angeles, affirmed by the City Council.LAANE estimates the value of the CTP, in terms ofreduced negative health impacts, at $2.2 billion inthe first five years of the program.51 The Port ofLong Beach estimated that the program will reducetrucking emissions 80 percent by 2012. Financedthrough a fee on loaded shipping containers, CTP isprogressively replacing and retrofitting older truckengines to meet 2007 emissions standards.52 Thereduced pollution will contribute to a higher quali-ty of life in primarily lower-income communitiesnear the ports.23Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesEven while L.A. ACORN tackled big issues like livingwages and inclusionary housing policies, the “breadand butter” of its organizing was helping residents wininfrastructure improvements at the neighborhood level.This work involved close engagement of city councilmembers. Improvements included new traffic lights, apublic swimming pool, street repaving, stop signs andother traffic safety measures, such as getting a streetreconfigured in Watts with a new bike lane. Theseimprovements likely are worth hundreds of thousands ofdollars and benefit as many as 250,000 residents.Thanks to the persistence of parent Martha Sanchezand others, ACORN was close to winning the closureand relocation of a metal plating factory located acrossfrom a South L.A elementary school, one of the largestin the nation, where teachers and parents have com-plained for years of ill health effects.53 Already, thegroup has secured approval for the removal of severalcontaminated industrial facilities, an extensive environ-mental cleanup and construction of the first phase of aplanned 450 unit affordable housing development. Thedevelopment plans include space for a publicly accessi-ble park and other services.Communities for a Better Environment’s Youth for Environmental Justice taketheir message to the streets.

Civil and Human RightsMany organizations working on basic rights have facedan uphill slog, as concerns such as marriage equalityand immigration reform have become hot-buttonissues. Yet, these groups have made gradual progresswhile they continue to fight for major systemicchanges. In doing so, they have used innovative strate-gies that include combining service delivery withorganizing, using legal advocacy and mobilizingthrough social networking. These strategies bring thewisdom of those who provide and receive services todecisionmakers, public interest lawyers and the broad-er public to generate action that leads to change.Same Sex Domestic Violence Survivors – The L.A. Gay& Lesbian Center has been a pioneer in developingprograms and services for victims of domestic violence(DV) in same-sex relationships. A 2004 restructuringwithin state health agencies resulted in all state DVfunds being directed entirely to shelter-based pro-grams, contributing to a severe shortfall in services tothe LGBTQ community because shelters have beenshown to not be an effective solution to this particularproblem. The center and Community United AgainstViolence in northern California approached EqualityCalifornia, a statewide advocacy organization, foradvice and help to restore funding. Ultimately, theywere able to secure funding through the budgetprocess, with help from a legislator in the LGBTQ cau-cus on the budget committee. The state approved aone-time augmentation of $300,000 in 2007 and$400,000 in 2008. The 2009 budget situation was toochallenging to secure any funding. However, thegroups helped legislators develop “clean-up” legisla-tion that enables LGBTQ providers to compete forfunds alongside DV groups. They are looking into thepossibility of tapping federal funding in the future. Alice Kessler, government affairs director at EqualityCalifornia, commented on the value of local organiza-tions collaborating with state level advocates: “TheGay & Lesbian Center and Community United AgainstViolence were our main community partners in legisla-tive efforts to assist LGBTQ domestic violence sur-vivors in California. Equality California sponsored thebills and did the day-to-day lobbying, but we relied onthese organizations for technical assistance andexpertise, and to help us tell legislators the stories ofwhy these services are so important by testifying athearings, identifying survivors willing to come for-ward, meeting with key lawmakers and writing supportletters and fact sheets. We would not have been suc-cessful in our advocacy without these very effectivepartnerships.”Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning/Queer (LGBTQ) Rights – Along with others interna-tionally, the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center has waged acampaign during the last three years – including onsocial networking web sites – to hold entertainmentvenues and promotional companies accountable forthe booking of reggae entertainers whose music andlyrics advocate harassment, violence and murder ofLGBTQ people. To date, the center has been success-ful in organizing to shut down concerts in Los Angelesand nationally by the clubs and promoters of these per-formers and now is working directly with the artists’representatives. 24National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyAs the largest nonprofit LGBTQ organization in the world, the L.A. GAY & LESBIAN CENTER often is called upon to help buildthe capacity of LGBTQ movements internationally. The center’s staff first learned of the homophobic music issue when the leadLGBTQ activist from Jamaica (whose name is withheld for his/her own safety) came to the U.S. to learn how to be a betterleader for the movement back home. In China, there is a project to identify young leaders who come to L.A. for intensivetraining, conducted in English. The center has trained three groups of Chinese activists so far. Back in China, the leaders haveformed a national umbrella for LGBTQ community centers, so they do not have to reinvent the wheel. Those who have com-pleted training mentor the next class.

CHIRLA leaders con-tacted workers’ family members, raised funds to helpthem, and identified lawyers who could representthem. Subsequently, CHIRLA helped set up the RaidResponse Network of attorneys and participated in alawsuit that challenged ICE practices in the raid, result-ing in the dismissal of at least five cases and the settlingof several others. Ahilan Arulanantham, director ofimmigrants’ rights and national security for theAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Southern California(ACLU/SC), co-led the Raid Response Network. Henoted that none of the workers’ cases have been lost todate. If pending government appeals fail, the casescould set an important legal precedent regarding howICE handles workplace raids. For CHIRLA andACLU/SC, the rulings highlighted how ineffectiveworkplace raids are, causing the federal government’sleaders to rethink their approach to immigrationenforcement. “The U.S. government spent endlesshours and an untold amount of taxpayer dollars toarrest hard-working people, almost all who had nocriminal history … The Van Nuys work site raid is onemore example of how a zealous focus on deportation-only measures can run amok,” said Xiomara Corpeño,director of community organizing at CHIRLA.54Federal-Local Immigration Enforcement – The ACLUalso supported CHIRLA and the South Asian Network(SAN) in their efforts to preserve the L.A. PoliceDepartment’s use of Special Order 40 – a 1979 policyprohibiting officers from using immigration status to ini-tiate investigations. The policy was instituted to encour-age immigrants to cooperate with police and developtrust between police and immigrant communities. In2006, a local resident sought to bar the use of city moneyto enforce the order, but community groups protestedthat victims of domestic violence, day laborers, and othervulnerable immigrants would be harmed if Special Order40 were overturned. In June 2009, a three-judge panelupheld the LAPD’s use of the policy. Outgoing LAPDChief William J. Bratton defended Special Order 40 in anL.A. Times opinion piece: “The philosophy that underliesthat policy is simple: Criminals are the biggest benefac-tors when immigrants fear the police. We can’t solvecrimes that aren’t reported because the victims are afraidto come forward to the police.”55In contrast, the L.A. County Board of Supervisorsdid enter into a memorandum of understanding(MOU) with ICE in 2005 that allows county sheriff’scustody assistants to engage in immigration enforce-ment by questioning immigrants who serve time in jail,prior to their release. Advocates fought the plan andthen worked successfully to ensure the MOU would benarrowly construed so that immigrants arrested andthen released or acquitted would not be subject to ICEenforcement. At a pivotal meeting of the Board ofSupervisors in January 2005, a constituent of SAN whowas a survivor of eight years of domestic violence tes-tified movingly that she never would have gone to thepolice for help if they had engaged in immigrationenforcement. Hamid Khan of SAN recalled her tellingthe supervisors that this policy would be “putting aknife in the hand of batterers.” Immigrant Access to Services – The Asian PacificAmerican Legal Center (APALC) and CHIRLA, alongwith other organizations, helped found and are keypartners in the California Immigrant Policy Center(CIPC).56 For more than a decade, the groups and CIPChave taken a lead role to protect access to state healthand human services programs serving immigrants.Immediately after 1996 welfare reform, APALC and itspartners fought for state-funded benefits to replace lostfederal benefits for legal immigrants, making Californiaa leader in this regard. Since then, they have fought toprotect health, nutrition and cash benefits for immi-grants, including fending off proposed budget cuts ona nearly annual basis. APALC also worked on servicesaccess issues at the local level, advocating for manyyears for improved language services in L.A. County25Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesMay Day March for immigrant rights. Photo courtesy of APALC. 26health facilities and welfare offices. Most recently, in2007, APALC helped secure nine full-time medicalinterpreters from the L.A. County Board of Supervisorsand the L.A. County Department of Health Services toserve public hospitals and health facilities where mostlower-income immigrants receive health care. Voting Rights – APALC leaders were concerned thatkey provisions of the federal Voting Rights Act were setto expire in 2007. They advocated at all levels of gov-ernment to ensure that provisions related to race, lan-guage and minority voting rights were renewed byCongress. In February 2006, APALC cosponsored astatewide Voting Rights Act conference in Los Angeles.Attended by 200 community leaders, the event creat-ed a broad network of advocates supporting the law’sreauthorization. APALC provided testimony to stateand federal legislatures and commissions about thebarriers to voting faced by Asian American and PacificIslander (AAPI) communities. The broad national coali-tion succeeded, and three key provisions wererenewed, including Section 203, which requires statesand counties to provide language assistance to voters. Police Brutality – As part of the Multi-Ethnic ImmigrantWorkers Organizing Network (MIWON), theKoreantown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA), acofounder of the network with CHIRLA, PilipinoWorker’s Center and Garment Worker Center havebeen organizing a May Day rally every year since 2000.They cosponsored a May Day rally in 2007 along withmany other groups in support of immigrants’ rights. L.A.police attempted to disperse the mostly peacefulMacArthur Park event with little warning, shooting rub-ber bullets and beating people with batons as theyattempted to flee. The National Lawyers Guild-L.A. andthe Mexican American Legal Defense and EducationalFund (MALDEF) filed a class action lawsuit on behalf ofMIWON, CHIRLA, KIWA and other community groupsinvolved in the rally and more than 200 individualsinjured by the police. In February 2009, the L.A. CityCouncil unanimously agreed to pay $13 million indamages to the plaintiffs and approved judicial over-sight of the LAPD’s crowd control procedures. 4. HealthEnvironmental Health – Several of the impactsdescribed elsewhere in this report will result in health-ier outcomes for residents of L.A. County. The LosAngeles International Airport community benefitsagreement, Air Quality Management District rulereducing flare emissions at oil refineries and the cleantrucks program at regional ports all are examples ofpolicy changes that will reduce toxins in the air, bringdown health care costs and improve respiratory healthfor thousands of Angelenos.Student Nutrition – People Organized for WestsideRenewal (POWER) and L.A. ACORN united to tacklethe poor quality of food that students and staff haveaccess to in their school’s cafeteria. As a result of theeffort, the L.A. Unified School District passed a newrequirement that: 1) reduces the amount of sugar, saltand trans fat in cafeteria food served at all LAUSDschools, 2) strengthens food inspection and handlingprocesses, and 3) creates a parent-led Cafeteria ReformCommittee that oversees implementation of the provi-sions. POWER and ACORN leaders participated on thecommittee during the first few years of implementa-tion. Affordable Prescription Drugs – The L.A. Gay &Lesbian Center has worked in coalition with otherorganizations across California as part of the CaliforniaHIV Alliance to ensure adequate resources for theAIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), which com-bines state and federal resources as well as pharma-ceutical rebates to make HIV/AIDS medicines afford-National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyHealth policy has been a central issue for L.A. VOICE AND PEOPLE IMPROVING COMMUNITIES THROUGH ORGANIZING(PICO). L.A. Voice and the other California PICO affiliates worked on children’s health care at a statewide level. They pusheda tobacco tax initiative three years ago that would have created a new tax on tobacco to fund universal health care for chil-dren in the state. The referendum system made it very challenging because two-thirds approval, rather than a simple majori-ty, is required for any new tax. Despite the defeat, the experience was positive for L.A. Voice, which grew as an organiza-tion and raised its profile among funders, and the national PICO network became engaged on health care issues in a coor-dinated way. The network made federal reauthorization of the state children’s health insurance program (SCHIP) a top prior-ity. PICO clearly helped lay the groundwork, and SCHIP renewal was one of the first things President Barack Obama signed. able. ADAP primarily serves lower-income, uninsuredclients, most of whom are nonwhite. California has thehighest budget and ADAP client enrollment level in thecountry. The alliance fought off $7 million in proposedcuts to the FY 2008 ADAP budget, which was $356.3million, of which $96 million came from the state’sgeneral fund. The governor’s proposed budget for FY2009 would have made steep cuts to state ADAP fund-ing, which would have meant a loss of federal match-ing funds and private funding as well. General fundcuts of $25 million ultimately were replaced by fundsfrom the ADAP Special Rebate Reserve Fund, ensuringthe program would continue operating at full capacity. Substance Abuse – The Gay & Lesbian Center realizeda few years ago that the rise of crystal methampheta-mine use among gay men was causing them to engagein riskier behaviors, resulting in many of them becom-ing infected with HIV. Working with the California HIVAlliance, the center won a line item in the state budg-et for an $11 million public education campaign tar-geted to gay men. The California Department ofAlcohol and Drug Programs launched the “Me NotMeth” campaign in March 2008. Lake ResearchAssociates evaluated the campaign and reported that asurvey among gay/bisexual/MSM (men who have sexwith men) in the summer of 2008 “already showedstrong indicators of a highly successful campaign … Incomparison to previous campaigns, data suggest MeNot Meth had more reach to key at-risk audiencessuch as those under 30, those without a collegedegree, and the unemployed. In the few months afterthe launch, analysis showed that those with exposureto the campaign were more likely than others to per-ceive crystal meth as a very serious problem; they weremore likely to say crystal meth is addictive (a key mes-sage), and they were more likely to say they will not trymeth in the future, even if ‘it’s just once to try it.’”575. Education and YouthNew Schools – In 2004, InnerCity Struggle (ICS) cam-paigned for and won the construction of a new highschool and a new elementary school for the East LosAngeles community. Esteban E. Torres High Schoolwill open in fall of 2010 and will be the first highschool to open in unincorporated East Los Angeles inmore than 80 years. The new school will relieve over-crowding at Garfield High School and allow Garfieldto return to a traditional 180-day schedule. The com-bined cost of the high school and elementary schoolis more than $299 million.College Preparation – Collaboration among communi-ty organizations has contributed to a series of ground-breaking changes to the education system. TheCommunity Coalition for Substance Abuse Preventionand Treatment and ICS joined forces to achieve sever-al significant education reforms. In coalition with otherorganizations, including the United Way, they formedCommunities for Educational Equity (CEE) and securedpassage of the so-called A-G Resolution Life-Prep bythe Los Angeles Unified School District in 2005. Thehistoric resolution guarantees all students access tocollege preparatory (“A-G”) classes, which previouslywere not available in many schools attended by stu-dents from lower-income and minority families, put-ting them at a disadvantage when applying for collegeentrance or making them ineligible to apply.Thousands of students and their allies attended theschool board vote on the resolution. Former board27Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesInnerCity Struggle youth and parents march for new schools in East L.A. Photocourtesy of ICS. 28president and city councilman José Huizar said, “Thestudents were saying ‘Set higher expectations for usand I’ll meet them.’ It was a huge deal, probably oneof the most important policy shifts in the district.”58Since 2005, the organizations have kept up pressureon LAUSD to fully implement the resolution in theirlocal schools. Education Funding – In 2007, the CommunityCoalition and ICS again worked together to persuadethe LAUSD to unanimously agree to place all SouthL.A. and East L.A. high and middle schools and someelementary schools atop the list for one-time specialfunding. The Quality Education Investment Act (QEIA)is a state law that sets aside funding to be targeted tolow-performing schools across the state. Knowing thatthere would be insufficient QEIA funds to help all suchschools, the two organizations sought to ensure thatSouth L.A. and East L.A. schools would be able to tapthe funding locally. The total amount going to Southand East L.A. schools is estimated at $326.8 millionthrough 2011 and will benefit tens of thousands of stu-dents. Also in 2007, several organizations cametogether to stop midyear teacher reductions, referred toas “renorming.” As part of a broader effort to shapestate budget reforms and accountability on the spend-ing of QEIA funds, ACORN, InnerCity Struggle, OneL.A., POWER, CADRE, a community-based member-ship organization, and the United Teachers LosAngeles (UTLA) preserved $18 million per year so thatclass size reduction efforts would not be undermined,benefiting 100,000 students. Turning out their mem-bers at a key public hearing and strategic media workaided their success. Youth Probation Camps – L.A. County runs 19 proba-tion camps that provide an alternative to imprisonmentfor thousands of youth each year. ACORN worked withthe American Federation of State, County andMunicipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 685 to preventcomplete elimination of the camps in 2004. The clo-sure of the probation camps would have negativelyaffected communities of color, according to AFSCMEstaff, as a majority of kids in camps are AfricanAmerican and Latino. The youths would have beenreleased into the community without gang preventionservices to support them, or they would have been sentto adult prisons to serve longer terms under harsherconditions, at a cost five times greater per youth, pos-sibly making rehabilitation harder. AFSCME reachedout to ACORN to mobilize affected communitiesaround this issue. ACORN hosted numerous events,including a town hall, and it used community organiz-ing to raise awareness about the issue. Together,AFSCME and ACORN helped avert $201 million dol-lars in budget cuts to the probation camps and gangintervention programs. These cuts would have elimi-nated jobs for 2,700 probation officers and other staffand negatively affected 4,500 juveniles in camps and890 juvenile gang members. A lobbyist involved withthe campaign credited ACORN’s involvement withhelping pave the way for a more permanent budgetaryfix; in 2009, probation funding was taken out of theState General Fund and funded instead through rev-enues from the vehicle license fee. Foster Care – As drug addiction took its toll in SouthL.A. during the 1990s, the Community Coalition real-ized that many of its members were becoming care-givers for grandchildren, nieces and nephews. Yet, thefoster care system was not responsive to their uniqueneeds. The coalition worked with its former executivedirector, California Assembly Speaker Karen Bass,Casey Family Programs and kinship care advocates tosecure state funding and legal reforms in 2006. Theysucceeded in getting $70.8 million allocated specifical-ly for kinship families in the foster care budget, and thelaw was changed to no longer mandate adoption by rel-ative caregivers. According to Gail Gronert in SpeakerBass’ office, “The Community Coalition brought groupsof kin caregivers to hearings multiple times and waseffective at getting out information on the value of rela-tive caregivers. They convinced legislators that kinadoption is not a productive option and to provide forkin foster care instead.” This story and others in thereport show the effectiveness of combining serviceswith advocacy, enabling experienced service providersto bring the voice of those needing services to policymakers. They demonstrate the synergies between directservices that intentionally target vulnerable communi-ties and advocacy, organizing and civic engagementdone by or on behalf of marginalized groups. C. CONSTITUENT ENGAGEMENTAs the impact highlights showed, each organizationfeatured in this report engages its constituencies inadvocacy and organizing on the issues that mattermost to them. This engagement of underrepresentedcommunities is valuable in its own right, as it bringsNational Committee for Responsive Philanthropy29people who have been left out of civic life into thedemocratic process. It also helps expand social capital– the networks and connections that bind peopletogether in a broader social fabric. Strong social capi-tal has been correlated with positive child outcomes,low crime rates, economic prosperity, physical andmental health, policy innovations and responsive gov-ernment. And civic engagement builds the “peoplepower” that is needed to bring meaningful change tothe institutions and systems that these communitiesrelate to and depend on. It is notable that whileCalifornia is one of the least civically-engaged states inthe country, this subset of community groups is buck-ing that trend. The National Conference on Citizenshipreported that the state is 45th in volunteering andworking on community problems.59 Yet, these 15organizations alone are connecting thousands of resi-dents to public life.The breadth and depth of constituent involvementamong the organizations studied is captured here withnumbers.

KIWA focuses onworkers’ rights (wage and hour, health and safety,Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesFor more than two decades, COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS OF LOS ANGELES (CHIRLA) has beenorganizing constituencies that no one else thought could or should be organized. One of the first groups in the country toorganize day laborers, CHIRLA has since organized immigrant students to fight for access to higher education, householdworkers to push for state labor protections and most recently, street vendors to combat police harassment and gain legiti-macy. The organization has evolved a highly sophisticated structure as it has grown. Currently, CHIRLA has a statewidechapter of immigrant youth clubs on 33 college and university campuses, and clubs at nine high school campuses in L.A.county.

Organizing Across Race and EthnicityPerhaps in response to the sheer diversity of languagesand cultures represented in the region, some commu-nity organizations in Los Angeles have led the waynationally in developing innovative approaches toorganizing among multiethnic and multilingual popu-lations. The 1992 civil unrest after the Rodney Kingverdict also was a wake-up call for area nonprofits thatracial and ethnic divisions ran deep and that groupsneeded to build bridges if they were to overcomepressing issues of poverty and economic distress. KIWA was founded in 1992 and its first campaign,to improve working conditions in Koreatown restau-rants, caused it to reexamine its identity. Executivedirector Danny Park explained, “KIWA started as a veryKorean, ethnic-specific organization that gave voice tothe needs of Korean workers, as opposed to just busi-ness owners, in response to the L.A. crisis. The restau-rant workers’ campaign transformed our organization.The workers in Koreatown restaurants were not justKorean but also Mexican and Central American. Latinoworkers were on the bottom rung of the workforce andthe whole restaurant industry. Korean workers some-times had a loyalty to Korean employers; Latinos weresometimes even discriminated against by Korean work-ers. Organizing in this industry meant organizing mul-tiracially.” KIWA kept its initials but eventuallychanged its name from Korean Immigrant WorkersAdvocates to Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance,signaling its support for all immigrant workers in theneighborhood.In taking this step to be multiracial, the organizationexperienced a backlash. “We were organizing for therights of all workers in Koreatown. The KoreanAmerican business owners attempted to present us asanti-Korean, claiming that KIWA was a ‘traitor to ourrace,’ asking ‘how can you organize Latinos againstyour own people?’” recalled Park. “But we were neveranti-Korean – we are just anti-exploitation.” WhenKIWA was getting attacked by the Korean businesscommunity and newspapers, the organization put outthe message that bringing justice to Koreatown is thebest way to serve the Korean community: “Stepping upto address injustices to all our neighbors and cowork-ers is the way to avoid more civil disturbances like in1992.” By the end of the restaurant campaign, KIWA’sinsistent message finally took hold. According to Park,on every anniversary of the 1992 unrest, the commu-nity asks itself how it is doing in terms of communityrace relations. Local ethnic media that used to attackKIWA now do a month-long radio show presenting thehistories of other communities of color to Korean-speaking audiences. Organizing among a multiethnic and multilingualbase requires added resources and use of creativestrategies. One way KIWA builds relationships and trustis sharing Korean and Latino forms of cultural resist-ance, such as Korean drumming, calligraphy and paint-ing among its members. Meetings take place in two orthree languages, which requires having interpreters atevery event and enough headsets for everyone whoneeds one. But the payoff is tremendous. DescribingKIWA’s ongoing affordable housing campaign, Park30National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyTHE COMMUNITY COALITION FOR SUBSTANCEABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT historically haschallenged the proliferation of local liquor stores andmotels that attract illegal behaviors. Because businessowners come from different racial and ethnic back-grounds, the organization’s leaders have taken pains toavoid racial divisions. In 2009, executive directorMarqueece Harris-Dawson made clear that the group’seffort to crack down on a Korean-owned liquor store wasnot racially motivated. In an opinion piece in the KoreaTimes on the 17th anniversary of the civil unrest, Harris-Dawson reminded readers that African American andKorean American communities came together in1992 tofind common ground, and today they should as well. “Inthe end, I do not believe that what we seek in our com-munity is different from what Korean Americans, Latinosor whites want for their own families and communities:safe parks and streets, good schools and opportunitiesfor the next generation. I believe if we work together forthese things in all our communities we can share muchmore than the painful memories of 1992.”61observed, “Ordinarily residents may just wave to eachother on the street, but through the KoreatownNeighborhood Organizing Committee (KNOCK) theycan talk about what each faces in terms of housing.Working together on a shared fight is a leap to a wholenew level in terms of relationship building.” Park com-mented that this work is very time consuming andresource intensive, something funders that are support-ive of multiethnic organizing often don’t appreciate.The South Asian Network (SAN), founded in 1990,unites extremely diverse constituencies. According toits web site, “The board, staff and volunteers are themost diverse and representative of any South Asianorganization. Composed of a majority of women, theteam includes persons of Bangladeshi, Indian,Nepalese, Pakistani and Sri Lankan origin fromBuddhist, Hindu, Jain, Christian, Muslim and Sikh tra-ditions; first generation immigrants and first generationU.S. born; speakers of Bengali, Fiji Hindi, Gujarati,Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Singhalese, Tamil and Urdu;and gay and straight members.”SAN has used a number of approaches to bringthese disparate constituencies together. Recently, SANbegan using headsets to translate simultaneously atmeetings where as many as 15 languages are spoken.Before, meetings were held in Hindi with informaltranslation, or SAN would conduct monolingual townhall meetings within specific neighborhoods in the lan-guage spoken by that community. The organizationspent its first several years doing broad communityoutreach, door-knocking and holding town hall meet-ings to surface issues, as well as giving a lot of thoughtto what kind of organization it wanted to be. At thattime, SAN decided to be identity-based and to leavereligion and homeland politics out of it. Now, as partof its larger analysis, SAN does examine the roles offaith and politics in the violation of human dignity andrights in the homeland. The group also embraced theconcept of service as an organizing tool and a way tobuild trust. SAN executive director Hamid Khan noted,“Service sometimes has a negative connotation inorganizing in the United States, but in South Asia it isa bringing together of community. Serving each otheris key to building trust. Our concept of membership isalso different. It’s not about paid membership per sebut about the lived experience of the community. Weare all members of the community. SAN is a part of thecommunity, not vice versa.” Building on the importance of service, SAN uses acase management structure that allows staff and volun-teers to build one-on-one relationships and identifysystemic issues that community members face, whichfacilitates organizing and informs SAN’s policy advo-cacy agenda. One example is the Community HealthAdvocacy Initiative (CHAI), which SAN launched in2003 to help residents organize activities and policiesthat promote community health, such as nutritionworkshops and clubs. These social interactions andrelationships of trust give residents who wereoppressed in their home country the courage to speakup publicly. After one 74-year old woman testified atan Artesia city council meeting to ask for funds for anutrition club, she said, “It felt really good, like tellingmy father-in-law off!”SAN’s role in organizing taxi workers also speaks tothe power of this relational model in uniting diverse con-stituents. The L.A. Taxi Workers Alliance (LATWA)includes immigrant drivers from as many as 47 differentcountries, including many from Africa who have neverbeen organized before in L.A. Betty Hung of the InnerCity Law Center observed, “SAN has organized the driv-ers in a culturally appropriate and effective way. HamidKhan was approached by childhood friends who weretaxi workers, so this broke down the organizer-leaderdichotomy, and building LATWA was a very organicprocess. SAN and LATWA are like family because astrong sense of community comes from SAN’sapproach.” The integration of service with organizingalso occurs in LATWA, which is led entirely by taxi work-ers. Recently, SAN helped LATWA plan a health fair so31Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesChanging attitudes is as important as changing poli-cies, but often this accomplishment is much harder tomeasure. In 2002, the SOUTH ASIAN NETWORK initi-ated a process for the whole organization to be educat-ed on LGBTQ issues. SAN built its LGBTQ leadership,held a board/staff retreat, formed a queer advisorycommittee and co-released a report on South AsianLGBTQ needs with Satrang, a South-Asian LGBTQgroup. They released the report on October 11, 2007– National Coming Out Day.62 SAN director HamidKhan said, “It was very transformative; we confrontedour own biases.” Since 2007, on October 11, SANhas had an annual procession down Pioneer Boulevardin Artesia, chanting “We are queer! We are here! Weare out on Pioneer!” Khan reflected on the long-termnature of overcoming prejudice, “Our constant engage-ment with the community involves planting seeds andstepping back, then repeating the process.” 32that taxi workers and their families who lack health ben-efits could receive a range of health screenings. Modeledon the CHAI program, the fair also was an opportunity tosign up new LATWA members. Khan has worked hard todevelop a set of shared values both at SAN and atLATWA, including challenging each organization toexamine its biases against LGBTQ individuals. 2. Youth Organizing and LeadershipDevelopment “Youth organizing has grown tremendously over thelast decade and groups like ICS in L.A. are leadingthe way in more sophisticated styles of organizing aswell as broader based wins. They have really shapedimportant legislation that’s being held up as the shin-ing example for others in different parts of the coun-try. And youth organizing results in some amazinglyskilled leaders. No social justice movement canachieve its vision without the central leadership ofyouth – particularly those from the most affectedcommunities.” —Surpriya Pillai, Executive Director, Funders Committee for Youth OrganizingVibrant and engaged youth are another hallmark ofadvocacy and organizing in L.A. There are manylocal community organizations with primarilyyouth constituencies, such as Youth JusticeCoalition, CADRE and Khmer Girls in Action.Among the research sample, several organizationsspecifically mentioned youth as part of their coreconstituency, including InnerCity Struggle (ICS),APALC, CHIRLA, Communities for a BetterEnvironment and the Labor Community StrategyCenter. And many of these groups are connected tobroader youth networks, including SoCal4Youthand California Fund for Youth Organizing.In order to organize youth in East L.A., ICS first formeda school club in Roosevelt High School in 2000. Studentsorganized their peers, then demanded and won changeson campus, such as Mexican American studies classesand additional guidance counselors. Other schools gotwind of the victories and wanted to form their own clubs.Today, ICS coordinates campus-based clubs, calledUnited Students (US), at four high schools and at two mid-dle schools, called US Junior. The clubs each have morethan 50 members with a teacher sponsor and meet week-ly at lunchtime to train and involve members in the work.As executive director Maria Brenes stressed, “The goal isfor the students to educate their peers to build studentpower for educational justice. United Students representsa vehicle for youth-led research, education and base-building efforts in high schools where such opportunitiesfor low-income Latino youth did not exist before.” One aspect of ICS’ success with United Students hasbeen the use of peer and parent surveys. ICS trainedyouth to conduct their own research, which provided anNational Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyINNERCITY STRUGGLE (ICS) has evolved into a power-ful intergenerational organizing structure that consists oftwo groups, one of students and one of families, thatcome together through coordinating committees todevelop and implement shared goals. This organizingstrategy, including the campus clubs described above,helped ICS grow its base from 100 to 1,300 youth andadults in eight years, develop 250 core leaders andachieve significant impacts such as new schools, pas-sage of the A-G resolution to increase college prep cur-riculum access, and targeting of millions in state educa-tion funds for East L.A. schools.COMMUNITIES FOR A BETTER ENVIRONMENT cre-atively engages youth, including many lower-incomestudents from Southeast Los Angeles who are affecteddirectly by environmental disparities.

Thisprocess fueled an interest and capacity in surveymethodology and data analysis among members. It alsogenerated important information to enlighten educationpractices in East L.A. and engage the media and policymakers. For example, the L.A. Times covered the 2007release of ICS’ report, “A Student and Parent Vision forEducational Justice in the Eastside.” The report drew onstudent and parent survey data and highlighted the edu-cational and resource inequities that lead to studentsdropping out of Eastside schools and low college enroll-ment rates. City leaders joined ICS to unveil the policyreport with a call to action. The report recommendedresources to increase parent engagement at localschools, alternatives to suspensions, preparation for A-Gclasses in middle school and opportunities for a qualitycareer and technical education. ICS and its youth lead-ers have the ear of decision makers and media outlets asthey continue to fight for equity in East L.A. schools. In 2005, Communities for a Better Environment’sYouth for Environmental Justice (Youth-EJ) engaged itsmembers in a video project to document the impactsof the I-710 freeway expansion on the local communi-ty. Youth-EJ members learned how to edit and shootvideo as well as interviewing and lighting techniques.Members from two high schools started a recyclingcampaign to raise community awareness about wasteand the environment and to raise funds for the group’sactivities. Thirteen CBE youth members participated inseveral trainings on how to research, compile and mapinformation about governmental agencies, polluters inthe neighborhood and health impacts. CBE youth werekey in organizing against the Nueva Azalea PowerPlant and the Vernon Power Plant proposals while pro-moting the use of clean renewable energy in Southeast L.A. The extraordinary organizing work of youth indefeating the Nueva Azalea project is documentedextensively in a recent book, Power Politics, written byUCLA anthropologist Karen Brodkin.In 2005, CBE sponsored a field trip for South GateHigh School in which students received a tour of theSouth Coast Air Quality Management District(AQMD), learned about the decision making processat the agency and voiced their support for a rule thatwould limit the environmental impact of new facilitieswithin 500 feet of a school. CBE adult and youth mem-bers also attended the AQMD Board meeting urgingthe Board to approve the rule. Darrel Cummings at the Gay & Lesbian Centerargued that his agency’s work with junior high schoolaged students is “controversial and in some ways, rev-olutionary.” A disproportionate number of LGBTQyouth drop out because they fear going to school. Theyhave never been taught about LGBTQ history, provid-ed role models or given emotional support. “So whenwe advocate for changes in school policy or programsto bring young LGBTQ people together, we do sobecause their families, schools, religious organizationsand government have knowingly failed them andplaced them at dramatically increased risk of drop out,depression, substance abuse, hate crimes, HIV/AIDSand suicide.” Recently, the Gay & Lesbian Center actedquickly to fill a gap in services for LGBTQ foster youthafter a group home was forced to close. The agency isworking with county leaders to develop a new pro-gram to provide extensive services that staff hope willbecome a national model. Organizing youth toimprove their schools and communities is not onlyeffective for changing policies but also for saving lives.3. Non-partisan Voter Engagement More than any other site studied to date for this proj-ect, Los Angeles organizations engaged in a high levelof nonpartisan voter engagement. At least 13 of the 15groups in the sample reported conducting voter regis-tration and/or get-out-the-vote (GOTV) drives some-time during the five-year study period. Combined, theirvoter engagement numbers are impressive:Total voters registered 103,499Direct GOTV contacts 238,528Indirect GOTV contacts 1,120,774Volunteers recruited 5,523Voters further engaged in organization 1,540Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesCBE’s Youth-EJ group rallies against the proposed Vernon Power Plant. Photocourtesy of CBE.34As reported by the groups, these efforts resulted inincreased turnout by voters in districts that were target-ed to boost the voice of lower-income and underrepre-sented residents in the democratic process:> In 2005, ICS experienced increased voter turnout of5 percent in the city council race in Boyle Heights.In the 2006 school board race, there was a 12 per-cent increase in three targeted districts and an 18percent increase in voter turnout in unincorporatedEast Los Angeles in the 2006 general election.> In 2006, the precincts where CHIRLA worked hadan increase in voter turnout from a level of 13 per-cent to 37 percent on average.> In 2006, LA Voice’s phone banking efforts at St.Odilia’s Catholic Church resulted in a 10 percentincrease in voter turnout among targeted congre-gants in several precincts in south L.A.> ACORN also reported increased voter turnout of 10percent in target precincts, 80 percent overallturnout in precincts targeted in key elections (2005state special election, 2008 presidential election),as well as increased Latino participation in2004–2006 voter projects.> Researchers hired with support from the IrvineFoundation concluded that SCOPE efforts raisedvoter turnout by 6.6 percent in targeted precincts inNovember 2008.> In the 2005 race for the open Los Angeles city coun-cil seat in District 11, POWER held a candidatesforum with the three top candidates attended bymore than 500 residents.> In 2008, APALC partnered with community organi-zations to increase Asian American and PacificIslander (AAPI) voter turnout by 17 percent andconducted poll monitoring at more than 160 sites toensure proper implementation of the Voting RightsAct with respect to access to translated voting mate-rials and interpreters for voters with limited Englishproficiency. The Community Coalition does some voter engage-ment but also sees the value of political education. In2008, it established a Civic Engagement Department toformalize its commitment to increase the leadershipand civic participation of South L.A. residents.According to staff, “The Civic Engagement Departmentregularly convenes political education classes, con-ducts focus groups to determine what issues voters aremost concerned about and what type of messagingwould get them to vote, leads legislative visits to keyelected officials and mobilizes our non-partisanprecinct walk and voter education program.” TheDepartment’s Civic Leadership School seeks to method-ically cultivate the civic leadership capacity of a criticalmass of informed residents. SAN made an intentionaldecision in 2004 not to do voter registration or turnoutNational Committee for Responsive PhilanthropySCOPE AND THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE ARE PART OF THE PUSHBACK NETWORK, a multistate collaboration of grass-roots organizations that seeks to deepen civic participation by people of color, poor and working class communities, women,immigrants and young people. Formed in 2005 by SCOPE and core groups in four other states, PBN is now in eight states:Alabama, California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico and New York. SCOPE served as fiscalsponsor for PBN through mid-2009. PBN members believe that voter engagement by indigenous, bottom-up organizations ismore effective than by entities that “parachute in” to communities just at election time and then leave. SCOPE staff has trav-eled to Boston to train Neighbor to Neighbor leaders in political education and power analysis.Housing L.A. coalition members rally for mixed income housing.

Hamid Khanexplained, “Our priorities and goals are political educa-tion and looking at civic engagement at a broader level– not limiting it to just voter registration.”SCOPE has made voter outreach central to its coremission. Despite its success in forging local alliances towin jobs programs, SCOPE’s leaders decided in 2001that in order to have a more responsive government,they needed to activate lower-income communities ofcolor more systematically through the political process.Since that realization, SCOPE has embarked on anambitious strategy that stimulates voter engagementlocally, statewide, and even at a multistate level.63> Locally, SCOPE has integrated voter engagementinto its overall work, such that the communityorganizing and voter outreach are done by the samestaff, members and volunteers who mutually rein-force one another. Door knocking by street actionteams to talk to voters also helps identify potentialnew leaders for the organization. A recent intensiveelectoral organizing program successfully contact-ed 29,000 registered voters with “social values”framing and messaging around tax and fiscal policyreform toward building a mass base of green jobssupporters. > To facilitate coordination on non-partisan voter out-reach strategies, SCOPE launched a regional501(c)4 coalition of community organizations,churches and unions called ALLERT, or Alliance ofLocal Leaders for Education Registration andTurnout. In 2006, ALLERT members made directcontact with voters in more than 300 precincts.> SCOPE is the convener and one of the anchororganizations of the California Alliance – a coali-tion of 16 organizations in six strategic areas of thestate. L.A. based members include CommunityCoalition, Inner City Struggle, SCOPE and ACORN.SCOPE codified three years of social values andcivic engagement best practices into a series oftraining curricula and organizing strategies forbuilding grassroots power. SCOPE also helped reor-ganize the California Alliance to focus on winningsystemic tax and fiscal reform and helped it engage110,000 individuals statewide on these issues. TheAlliance developed a four-year strategy – California2012 – that aims to build progressive powerthroughout the state. SCOPE developed strategiccommunication strategies for the alliance to reachkey constituencies better and move their values andworldview in progressive directions. 4. Ballot InitiativesAs Jared Rivera at L.A. Voice observed, California’sproposition process poses frequent dilemmas for grass-roots organizations. “If you want to go on the offensive,you need money to pay signature gatherers and con-duct a media campaign. If you’re on the defensive, youStrengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesACORN leaders rally against foreclosures and urge residents to get out the vote. Photo courtesy of L.A. ACORN 36need money to launch and fight your opposition cam-paign. There is no way to keep up.” Groups often areforced to pick and choose their battles, given that thereare often two or more ballot initiatives that directlyaffect their particular constituency.Despite these challenges, organizations in thisstudy chose to mobilize their constituencies aroundspecific ballot measures. They decided that the propo-sition process offered them opportunities to train lead-ership, organize their base and educate voters –oppor-tunities that were worth it regardless of the outcome.APALC has worked on several redistricting measures.ICS, the Strategy Center, Los Angeles MetropolitanChurches, CHIRLA, Youth Justice Coalition and othersworked to defeat Proposition 6, a 2008 initiative thatwould have redirected close to $1 billion of educationand human service funding for prison and probationspending, imposed stricter penalties for some crimesand tried juveniles as adults in gang related offenses. A more highly-publicized initiative in 2008 wasProposition 8, which overturned the legality of mar-riage equality in California. Leading up to it and sincethe measure passed, several groups have been invest-ed heavily in creating a different outcome. The L.A.Gay & Lesbian Center was part of the executive com-mittee of the campaign against Prop 8. Even though theinitiative passed, Darrel Cummings sees the tremen-dous value of the process and what has happenedsince. It has energized the center’s organizing effortsand its LGBTQ base, taught leaders valuable votermobilization skills, and caused them to reach out toother communities. “We are organizing directly incommunities that voted against us, talking one on onewith voters and forging coalitions with people of colororganizations in this effort. We are documenting themessages that move these constituencies to neutral orpro marriage,” reported Cummings. “And folks arebeing trained in political work; our leaders are gainingskills they didn’t have before. This is a big win for us,not just yet at the ballot box but in the leadershipdevelopment of our community.” Cummings shared the story of a young transgenderman who had lived in relative anonymity and workedin a somewhat hostile corporate environment until hewas recruited to be involved in the center’s Vote forEquality program. He became a regular volunteer andworked on many efforts for the “No on 8” campaign.After the campaign, he became a key volunteer leader,offering nearly 35 hours per week of his time to theeffort. He is now a member of the Vote for Equality staffand says that this work has had a profound and posi-tive effect on his life.For the last five years, APALC has provided signifi-cant support to a coalition effort to move the AAPIcommunity to be more supportive of marriage equali-ty. APALC and other supporters of civil and LGBTQrights were shocked when the mainstream media cov-ered two demonstrations against marriage equalityNational Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyMembers of the South Asian Network marching in support of LGBTQ rights and against Proposition 8.

Community leaders organizedtwo coalitions, API Equality in the Bay Area and APIEquality-LA in southern California. APALC helpedfound and support the coalition, which conductedone-on-one outreach at ethnic festivals, embarked ona mass media campaign among the Asian languagepress, and built a strong alliance of more than 50 AAPIgroups supporting marriage equality. They recruitedAAPI opinion leaders to speak out, including state leg-islators, nonprofit directors, faith leaders, activists andcelebrities. The state Supreme Court granted same-sexmarriage rights in May 2008 and the ballot measureoverturned them six months later, yet Karin Wang atAPALC is pleased with their progress. “We polledAsian American voters between 2000 and 2008 on thisissue and saw a clear trajectory of change. In eightyears, Asian Americans moved more toward marriageequality than the general public did.” D. EFFECTIVE COALITIONS “The knock on community organizing is that we all actin silos … L.A. is a very exciting example because wehave three of the major organizing networks [ACORN,PICO and NPA] working jointly and there aren’t manycases of this around the country. What we learned isthat we have remarkable power. We really revived apolicy issue that was politically dead. And now we’retalking about what our next campaign is because welearned about how to move votes in the city. When wecollaborate, we can really become greater than thesum of our parts.” —Jared Rivera, L.A. Voice - PICOThe achievements described in this report ofteninvolved organizations working together to attain theirgoals. All of the groups in the sample listed local,regional and national partners when describing theirsuccesses. Indeed, the diverse geography and popula-tion in L.A. County make collaboration for advocacyand organizing essential. Many organizations in L.A. contribute their powerto statewide and national efforts. For example, CHIRLAworks closely with the National Immigrant LaborCoalition and the Center for Community Change onnational immigration reform. CHIRLA also helped cre-ate and sustain the local Multi-ethnic ImmigrantWorker Organizing Network (MIWON), statewideCalifornia Immigrant Policy Center and National DayLabor Organizing Network (NDLON). Community-labor alliances have been key to sever-al of the groups’ wins, and LAANE has gone beyondlocal community-labor partnerships to multistateefforts. LAANE understood that for its proposed CleanTrucks Program (CTP) to be successful, it would needto be implemented not just at Southern California portsbut nationwide, to prevent any one port from having acompetitive advantage over any other. The Coalitionfor Clean and Safe Ports has coordinated with sistercoalitions in other major port cities, including Newark,New York, Oakland, Seattle and Miami. Several Los Angeles organizations, including KIWA,SAN and Strategic Alliance for a Just Economy (SAJE),participate in the national Right to the City (RTTC) net-work. RTTC emerged in 2007 as a unified response togentrification and a call to halt the displacement oflower-income people, LGBTQ and youth of color fromtheir historic urban neighborhoods. RTTC membershave developed a common theory of change and seekregional and national impact in housing, human rights,urban land, community development, civic engage-ment, criminal justice and environmental justice.With the state and local budgets in crisis, somegroups have come together to open dialogue aboutcommunity priorities. In 2009, South Asian Network,Labor Community Strategy Center, CommunityCoalition, L.A. Community Action Network, Youth37Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN LEGAL CENTER used theopportunity to file an amicus brief with the CaliforniaSupreme Court in support of marriage equality as aninnovative organizing tool.64 Aware that an amicusbrief can have marginal influence on a court case atbest, APALC and other community leaders saw an open-ing to use the process of assembling the brief to marshalthe AAPI community’s support for marriage equality.According to Karin Wang at APALC, “The brief alsoserved several specific goals: to draw parallels betweenstruggles for racial justice and LGBT rights; to educatethe Asian American community about a key social jus-tice issue; and to build a strong coalition of AsianAmerican voices that included both LGBT and alliedmembers of our community.”65 The effort succeeded inbringing together very diverse Asian American commu-nities that had not worked together previously on a com-mon agenda or publicly supported LGBTQ issues.38Justice Coalition and Homies Unidos formed the L.A.Coalition against State Violence. The coalition hasopened discussions about what creates true communi-ty safety and challenges state and police violence. 1. Forging Common Ground: Grassroots andLegal StrategiesCombining community organizing with litigation canstrengthen efforts to change public policy. While manygrassroots organizations in other GCIP sites have foundpower in partnering with lawyers, the extent and depthof these partnerships in L.A. was notable. The L.A. TaxiWorkers Alliance has accomplished much to improveworking conditions and wages for cabbies, with helpfrom SAN and public interest lawyers. Unfortunately,L.A. cab companies have tried to silence the taxi work-ers through frivolous lawsuits. In October 2008,APALC and a private law firm defended LATWA, SANand SAN director Hamid Khan against a lawsuitbrought by seven cab companies, alleging that theirorganizing activities violated restrictions on nonprofits.APALC successfully argued that “the ability to speakout against injustice, to petition the government forredress, and to demand change from oppressive corpo-rate practices are essential to the work of nonprofits.”69The Bus Riders Union often partners with theNatural Resources Defense Council to bring litigationNational Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyIn the late 1990s, several organizationsin Los Angeles concerned about thearea’s dwindling supply of affordablehousing came together to form HousingL.A. The original purpose of the coali-tion was to establish the city housingtrust fund, which succeeded in 2002.As then-executive director of theSouthern California Association forNonprofit Housing (SCANPH) JanBreidenbach described it in Shelterforce,Housing L.A. was “a three-year cam-paign so broad and inclusive thatopposing its demand for a trust fund ofthis magnitude was simply not anoption.”66 Working with SCANPH,organizing groups including L.A. Voice,L.A. ACORN and POWER continuedthe work of the coalition beyond its ini-tial victory to push for a citywide mixedincome housing ordinance (MIHO).Their initial attempt on the heels of thehousing trust fund victory failed, butabout three years ago the coalitionrevived its efforts to pass inclusionaryzoning in the city.67Since then, L.A. Voice, L.A.ACORN, POWER and SCANPH havetogether carried out much of the coali-tion’s work, while Housing L.A. hasmany additional members that lendtheir power and constituencies foractions and meetings with decisionmakers. The coalition leaders feel thatthey have developed effective methodsfor working together and making deci-sions about strategy. As for dealing with conflicts, oneleader said, “The positive aspect of it isyou see so many different ways ofapproaching the problem, it helps youthink of strategy in a more robust waybecause there are different mindsapproaching it from different perspec-tives. You appreciate those perspectivesbecause you have to argue throughthem. We’ve maintained a good work-ing relationship.” The process of facingdifferences and setting policy and strat-egy priorities brought the four coregroups closer and established groundrules for working together. One leaderattributed the success to historical trust-ing relationships among the coregroups, and said that the processhelped establish a strategy for the coali-tion that all could sign on to. Those thatdidn’t agree left the coalition. “But whatwe ended up with at the end was amuch stronger group committed toworking together on an effective collab-oration.” Another leader noted thatHousing L.A. developed out of a shareddesire to ensure access to affordablehousing in the county, rather than as aresult of a funder offering financial sup-port for the work. “There are fundamen-tal disagreements about strategy attimes, but it was significant that wechose ourselves to be part of this andthere was no financial obligation hold-ing it together.”At the beginning of the coalition’swork, there were questions about how todefine victory. Some groups felt that pass-ing any inclusionary zoning ordinancewould be a success, even if it didn’taddress all of the coalition’s concerns. Theordinance could serve as a structure onwhich to build future campaigns. Othersfelt that it was important to push for anordinance that addressed the needs of allmembers’ constituents. Ultimately, thealliance decided to push for an initial ordi-nance that could be amended in thefuture. The coalition also grappled withhow to address members’ varying comfortlevels with diverse strategies. One waythe coalition dealt with these differenceswas to coordinate work across organiza-Housing L.A.: Building Power, Achieving Change 39supporting its grassroots efforts. In 2007, the MTA pro-posed substantially increasing fares. BRU turned out1,500 people to the MTA board meeting, and NRDCjoined the effort by suing MTA for violating CaliforniaEnvironmental Quality Act (CEQA) statutes. TammyBang Luu of BRU said, “The strengths of a grassrootsmovement can leverage the power of science or legaltactics, which really enhances our ability to win victo-ries in a political fight. There is a role for law in enhanc-ing people’s access to civil rights and in that way ourfight enhances the ability for others to struggle.”The Southern California ACLU has helped immi-grant and ethnic groups locally. After 9/11, the FBIstepped up its interrogations of South Asians in L.A.According to Hamid Khan at SAN, FBI agents wouldcome to individuals’ homes to engage in “friendlyinterviews,” with no lawyer present, but then woulduse any inconsistencies in a person’s responses to pur-sue legal charges. The ACLU/SC has provided legalcounsel for many South Asians whose cases werereferred by SAN. The very presence of an attorneywould discourage FBI agents from going on a “fishingexpedition” that could result in charges unrelated tonational security.Collaboration between public interest lawyers andgrassroots organizations in L.A. has been symbiotic,benefiting both sets of partners. An example of this isthe Micro Solutions raid. The ACLU fought ICE deten-Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunitiestions while each group worked in its ownway. For example, one group could holdactions to build organizing in its membercongregations and other groups couldhold direct actions or letter-writing cam-paigns. Said one leader, “Sometimes,coalitions can get bogged down in tacti-cal things where everyone has to agree.This allowed people to organize in theway that they already do.”The coalition has had success: in2007, it secured public pledges of com-mitment from nine out of fifteen citycouncil members. The coalition also hasa stronger relationship with the mayor’soffice in part as a result of its work onthe pledge campaign. The ordinancewas close to passage, but there was alegal challenge on the rental portion ofthe ordinance because of a statewidelaw that could have categorized therental units as illegally rent-controlled.Housing L.A. is now talking with the cityabout moving forward with an ordi-nance that covers for-sale units, with atrigger built in so that if the statewidelaw is reversed, the ordinance alsowould cover rental units.68Housing L.A. has just begun seekingfunding for its work, which includesaddressing complicated questions suchas which organization will be the fiscalsponsor and how the money will be dis-tributed among the members. Anotherchallenge is communicating the value ofthe work to funders. One leader said,“If you go out and ask key politicalleaders about our coalition, they willsay that we were very effective, deter-mined and smart with strategy.” Butbecause the campaign is still underwayand hasn’t yet achieved its ultimategoal, it is difficult to explain the value ofthe coalition’s work in a way that res-onates with funders. Nevertheless,members of the coalition continue todevote significant time and resources tothis issue, which they believe has enor-mous potential payoff for lower-incomeresidents and renters.LA Councilmember Janice Hahn signing the Housing L.A. pledge.

Lawyers thought this was a huge victory, sincethe workers would have freedom of movement andnot be detained indefinitely. However, the communi-ty groups said this was a disaster. There was the visu-al stigma of the electronic ankle collars, plus ICE staffhad to do home visits – no one wanted ICE pokingaround their residence, so some people were gettingkicked out of their homes, and the collars had to berecharged daily, requiring workers to sit in one placenear an electrical outlet for hours every day. So, theACLU sued and got the electronic collars removed.The ruling was overturned on appeal, but ICE did notput the collars back on the workers. Since workers didnot run away, ICE realized there was no need for themonitoring system. Southern California ACLU director of Immigrants’Rights and National Security Litigation AhilanArulanantham noted, “The community organizationsact as the eyes and ears of the legal organizations andinfluence our priorities. This collaboration makes thebest of both community lawyering and legal activism.The community activists in these groups are empow-ered by legal knowledge and backed by our legalresources. In turn, our legal strategies are informedand shaped by the priorities of these communityorganizations.”2. Challenges for Organizations and FundersAs the Housing L.A. and legal-grassroots partnershipsdemonstrate, it can be challenging for coalitions tobuild trust and to reach agreement on strategy andagenda. Housing L.A. members approached conflictsdirectly and have developed ways to work through dis-agreement. The members value different strategies andallow each other to work in ways that are comfortable.However, leaders discussed coalitions that they felthad not yet reached that level of discourse as well asthe difficulties of accomplishing goals without thattrusting space for dissent and compromise.The groups identified some key challenges theyencountered in coalitions that they felt were not effec-tive at achieving stated goals:a. Agreeing on a common strategyOrganizations have differing philosophies regardingpolicy advocacy and community organizing. Theorganizations included in this report employed avariety of strategies, from direct action and con-frontational tactics to lobbying and legal work.Coalitions bring organizations together that maydiverge in strategy, so in order for the collaborationto work, the coalition must develop a process fordetermining strategy and dealing with tactical dis-agreements. Trust must be built over time throughrelationships, intentionality and successes on whichto build. Several leaders indicated that coalitionsformed because of funding rather than a sharedconcern for a given issue often struggled to buildtrust among member organizations. One leader described an experience in a funder-driven coalition that struggled to gain traction; indi-vidual organizations had small successes, but thecoalition did not achieve its stated goals. “It wasn’tgreater than the sum of its parts.” Learning from thisexperience, the funder is now embarking on a newcoalition strategy in which it is letting the collabo-ration develop naturally rather than selecting specif-ic organizations for membership.b. Addressing variable goalsLeaders stated that the most effective coalitions they’dbeen part of focused on a concrete achievement, suchNational Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyKorean War veterans who were defrauded by a cemetery that falsely prom-ised them a dedicated memorial resting place. The Asian Pacific AmericanLegal Center won the lawsuit on behalf of these veterans. Photo courtesy ofAPALC. 41as passing the inclusionary zoning policy. In the casesof coalitions with ambitious goals such as health carereform, leaders felt that these coalitions could beeffective only if they took the internal time to developconcrete steps to achieving their goals. Leaders identified the need to agree on a com-mon definition of victory for the coalition as oneimportant step toward developing group cohesion.Said one leader in the Housing L.A. coalition, “Is avictory what will directly impact our membershipand the membership of the organizations around thetable?” Carving out the time to agree on this ques-tion is part of what has led to a successful coalition.c. The role of the funderLeaders both lauded and critiqued the role of fun-ders in coalitions. Some leaders felt that a funder-initiated coalition runs the risk of attracting mem-bers due to the funding available rather than sharedvalues and goals, which can lead to conflict andresentment within the coalition. However, leadersalso emphasized that funders can have a positiveimpact on the development of a nascent coalition,as in the case of the GREEN LA Coalition andLiberty Hill Foundation. One leader noted that because many funders areinexperienced when it comes to supporting advoca-cy and organizing, grantees are expected to put pro-posals, workplans and reports into a model that isfunder-designed rather than community organizing-based. “It takes away from our ability to be effec-tive. It would be great to have more of a ‘meet mehalfway’ approach.” The key is for funders toengage in coalition-building with trusted nonprofitpartners as coalition leaders, listen to their nonprof-it partners’ needs and concerns, and be flexible intheir approach. 3. Supporting Effective CollaborationFunders passionate about a particular issue may thinkit necessary to create a new coalition by gatheringtogether nonprofits working on that issue. However,this does not necessarily result in effective collabora-tion. Coalition-building is a process that involves fos-tering trust among members, crafting objectives, strate-gies and tactics that everyone can support, and comingto agreement on how to deal with conflict.The GREEN LA Coalition formed shortly after MayorVillaraigosa was elected on a platform of turning LosAngeles into the greenest major city in the country.Mainstream environmental groups partnered withStrengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesStudents speak out in support of an Architecture, Construction and Engineering (ACE) Academy in South L.A., which combines college prep curriculum withcareer technical education.

The LibertyHill Foundation played a critical role in supporting thisnew collaboration by convening early meetings, pro-viding staff time and furnishing office space. BillGallegos of Communities for a Better Environmentcalled the partnership “unique” – The Sierra Club, Healthe Bay, Tree People, the Environmental Defense Fundand other environmental groups are working closelywith environmental justice organizations like CBE,Pacoima Beautiful and East Yard Communities forEnvironmental Justice to address the city’s environmen-tal problems. Michele Prichard of Liberty Hillexplained, “The GREEN LA experience has producedsignificant gains in such areas as prioritizing fundingfor parks in low-income areas; increasing water con-servation and recycling; expanding bicycle, bus andpedestrian projects; and establishing the city’s newgreen business certification and purchasing programs.The coalition’s model is to work with municipal gov-ernment to identify priorities and solve real problems,even while ‘pushing the envelope’ for the most ambi-tious reforms possible.”The coalition has several working groups, one ofwhich focuses on environmental justice. Bill Gallegosdescribed the process of setting priorities for the coali-tion: “From the beginning, when we were definingprinciples and priorities, the environmental justicecommunity insisted that environmental justice be atthe center of all GREEN LA’s work. It was very impor-tant to not just subsume environmental justice as oneof a dozen points that the coalition wanted to work on;it is a very central piece to all that we have to do. Theworst water problems are in communities of color inthe city and communities of color are the majority inthe city. We wanted all of GREEN LA to commit toenvironmental justice as a priority and they have.” Funders can support coalition work effectivelythrough multi-year investments in their nonprofit part-ners and lending their convening, research and lever-aging power to support the formation of new coali-tions. In addition to its convening and staff support rolein GREEN LA, Liberty Hill introduced the coalition toits grantmaking peers to leverage funding. In L.A. County, collaboration among groups isessential for achieving change. A strong coalition canachieve remarkable results, building community trustand strengthening participatory democracy in theprocess of improving conditions for its constituents. National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy43VI. Considerations and Recommendationsfor FundersAs this report shows, institutional funders play avital role in supporting nonprofits in Los AngelesCounty to solve the region’s pressing problems. Amongthe 15 groups in NCRP’s sample, foundation supportfor their advocacy, organizing and civic engagementwork totaled more than $58 million, representing 77percent of their total advocacy and organizing budgetsbetween 2004 and 2008. A. EFFECTIVE FUNDING STRATEGIESL.A. County offers many examples of philanthropicbest practices to support advocacy, organizing andcivic engagement. Important tools include providinggeneral operating support grants and multi-year fund-ing, soliciting input from nonprofit partners and help-ing to enhance their capacity, supporting effective col-laboration, contributing to a strong nonprofit infra-structure and encouraging their philanthropic peers tosupport these strategies. The sample groups reported that receiving sub-stantial, unrestricted and consistent funding allowedthem to be responsive to opportunities and plan forthe future – essential elements of effective advocacyand organizing. Several nonprofit leaders expressed adesire for funders to take the long view; advocacyand organizing address systemic problems that willnot change in a one or two year time period.Organizations felt that funders must make an effort tounderstand the scale of Los Angeles and the complex-ity of the problems facing communities there. Oneleader said, “L.A. has been dealing with so manyissues that the rest of the country is just starting tofocus on; here all the issues are at the breakingpoint.” Following are examples of ways in which fun-ders have served as partners to nonprofits in supportof their advocacy, organizing and communityengagement work in L.A. County.1. Summary of Foundation Support forAdvocacy and Organizing in L.A.

Close to 3,000 active foundations in the areagave $2.1 billion in 2007. However, only a small pro-portion of those foundations give to advocacy, organ-izing and civic engagement work. Fifty-five percent ofthe 98 foundations listed above as funding partners arenational; 32 percent are based in the Los Angeles area.Organizations in the sample frequently noted theirreliance on out-of-state support. The L.A area and California foundations recog-nized most frequently for being effective partnerswith nonprofits in their advocacy, community organ-izing and civic engagement efforts were: theCalifornia Community Foundation, the CaliforniaEndowment, the California Wellness Foundation, theJames Irvine Foundation, the Liberty Hill Foundation,United Way of Greater Los Angeles, and the Women’sFoundation of California. 3. Practices of Exemplary Funding Partnersa. Exemplary funding partners provide flexible, multi-year funding, reflecting the time horizon for impactAdvocacy and organizing campaigns can takeyears to achieve their stated outcomes. Along theway, organizations must respond to changes in thepolitical landscape, adapt to unforeseen economicor natural events, forge partnerships with othernonprofits and relationships with public leaders,and organize constituents. These efforts take timeand resources. By investing in the mission and workof their nonprofit partners, funders are showing thatthey trust their grantees to do what they say theywill and are investing in their long-term ability todo so. In addition to providing stability, core sup-port and multi-year funding also increase agilityand allow organizations “wiggle-room” to respondto an unexpected opportunity or prevent harmfulpolicies from passing. Madeline Janis of LAANE expressed her views onexemplary funders frankly: “A really good funder givesgeneral operating support grants of significant size,consistent multi-year grants, has regular conversationswith grantees, but does not have onerous reportingrequirements.” She named the French AmericanCharitable Trust (FACT)71 as a funder that exemplifiesthese principles and provides additional technicalassistance funding for urgent needs. FACT is spending down its endowment and plansto close its doors in 2012. The foundation is leverag-ing its small resources to be as strategic as possibleand prepare its grantees for success beyond its spend-down date. According to FACT director Diane Feeney,“We can maximize our impact most effectively bymaking sure our grantees have the stable, general sup-port (flexible) resources and capacity they need tothrive even when FACT is no longer around. Ourcapacity building program is a central part of our grantmaking and ensures that as we support our granteesfinancially, we also help strengthen their internalinfrastructure.” FACT makes general support grants forcommunity based organizing and intermediary groups(nonprofit technical assistance providers), makesthree-year organizational development grants to twoof its grantees and small discretionary grants forgrantee (capacity building) needs of limited durationand scope, and also funds a pool of consultants thatwork with grantees on management and governanceissues over a longer time horizon.Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities b. Exemplary funding partners value intermediate out-comesThe process of advocacy and organizing buildsorganizational capacity. When a group doesn’t achieveits goal, there often are intermediate outcomes thatbring the organization closer to its target. By recogniz-ing the importance of these interim gains, funders canbetter understand what their nonprofit partners need toget to the next level in their work. Funders also canhelp their nonprofit partners identify appropriate inter-im benchmarks.The Housing L.A. coalition held several publicactions to build organizing and public support forinclusionary zoning. One July 2007 action drew 1,000people to a member congregation where CouncilPresident Eric Garcetti and the deputy mayor both pub-licly committed to passing a mixed income housingordinance (MIHO). Next, the coalition worked tosecure more public pledges, winning commitmentfrom nine out of fifteen city council members. HousingL.A. has a strong relationship with Mayor Villaraigosa’soffice as a result of its public commitments campaign.If an ordinance passes next year, the campaign willhave taken three years to achieve “success.” However,all of its activities within those years have contributedto the coalition’s ability to accomplish its goals. It isessential that funders comprehend this process so thatthey can be flexible and supportive of their nonprofitpartners.c. Exemplary funders support the coalition work oftheir nonprofit partnersL.A. County has a scale that all but requires organ-izations to work in coalition. Many organizationsexpressed frustration that funders do not support exist-ing effective collaboration, opting instead to seed newcoalitions around issues or geographic areas of impor-tance to the funder. One leader said, “Nonprofits havea mission and either you support it or don’t, rather thantrying to intervene and control that mission. Fundersmay see low-capacity groups that could benefit frompartnering with other groups.” However, this leader feltthat funders making grants available for existing coali-tions would be more helpful than foundation staff ini-tiating a new coalition. Foundations can contribute positively to the birthof a new coalition when they work in solidarity withtheir nonprofit partners. Bill Gallegos of Communitiesfor a Better Environment(CBE) described the waysin which the Liberty Hill Foundation nurturedGREEN LA through itsearly stages, helping itgrow to the strong, cohe-sive coalition that it istoday. Liberty Hill playedan active role in conven-ing the early meetings ofthe coalition and reachedout to fellow fundersincluding the California Endowment, NathanCummings Foundation, and the AnnenbergFoundation to help increase foundation support forthe coalition. Liberty Hill has furnished offices for thecoalition’s staff; before the coalition had staff, LibertyHill did much of the legwork for the coalition and pro-vided administrative support. Leveraging funding,convening and foundation staff time are just some ofthe ways foundations can help nascent coalitionsreach their full potential. d. Exemplary funding partners support capacity build-ing needs identified by nonprofitsThroughout this report, there are many examples ofthe ways in which groups built their capacity in orderto achieve impressive impacts. Even for ongoing cam-paigns that have not yet met their goals, capacitybuilding is an important component of success.Supporting capacity building is a way for funders to gobeyond the grant and deepen their commitment totheir nonprofit partners.Liberty Hill and the James Irvine Foundation stoodout in the region as funders the groups named time andagain as exemplary partners when it came to fundingappropriate, individualized capacity building. Some ofthe ways in which these foundations distinguished46National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyEven for ongoing campaigns that have not yet met their goals,capacity building is an important component of success.Supporting capacity building is a way for funders to go beyondthe grant and deepen their commitment to their nonprofit partners.47themselves as true partners with grantees include:> Providing L.A. Voice PICO, POWER and SCOPEwith customized workshops from the GrassrootsInstitute for Fundraising Training (GIFT) to helpbuild their individual donor base (Liberty Hill).> Providing tailored executive director leadershiptraining and other technical assistance toCommunities for a Better Environment (Irvine).> Helping new and emerging efforts, including help-ing identify fiscal sponsors, as for the L.A. TaxiWorkers Alliance (Liberty Hill).> Providing strategic planning and communicationsdevelopment support for LAANE (Irvine).Latonya Slack of the James Irvine Foundation saidthat the foundation is committed to providing supportto its grantees beyond just project funding.  “Capacitybuilding can help an organization become better atachieving its mission.  Advocacy organizations need tobe responsive and agile and capacity-building canhelp them to reach that goal.”  Cheryl Branch of Los Angeles MetropolitanChurches (LAM) praised Marguerite Casey as “a 21stcentury funder.” LAM wanted to host a Sunday morn-ing radio talk show to provide a community forum toaddress important issues. As Cheryl said, “I can get1,000 people in the room, but I can’t get 8,000 peoplein the room.” Marguerite Casey provided funding toLAM as part of its Equal Voices for America’s FamiliesCampaign, which allowed the organization to pur-chase double the amount of airtime it was originallyable to afford.In the current economic crisis, nonprofits are facingdifficult strategic choices. Fred Ali, president and CEOof the Weingart Foundation expressed concern aboutthe impact of the financial downturn on nonprofitcapacity. Because nonprofits are under immense pres-sure to meet the needs of more of their communitymembers using fewer resources, some may opt to cutback on capacity-building activities such as profes-sional development. Funders can provide a cushionand encourage their nonprofit partners to continuetheir capacity building efforts by investing in ways thatsupport them doing so. e. Exemplary funding partners take calculated risks.For many of the reasons discussed above, fundersoften are wary of supporting advocacy, organizing andcommunity engagement groups out of fear that theyare too risky. However, as this report demonstrates,thoughtful and strategic risk-taking is an essential ele-ment of success and a strategy that can have enor-mous payoff for funders and their nonprofit partners.Particularly in Los Angeles County with its multilay-ered challenges that cut across issue, ethnic and classlines, funders can and should do more to leverage thepower of advocacy and organizing to address sys-temic problems. Stewart Kwoh at APALC described funders joiningforces to support California Forward, a bipartisan effortto restructure state budgeting and governance policies.California Forward is seeking to change the currenttwo-thirds vote rule for budgets and reform term limitsin the state. The William and Flora HewlettFoundation, the Parsons Foundation, the James IrvineFoundation and the California Endowment all cametogether to support California Forward. These founda-tions recognize that a functional state is critical to thesuccess of their nonprofit partners, and they havejoined forces with other funders to push for gover-nance reform in the state. This is a long-term effort, butthe funders recognized the harm of inaction: withoutreform, lower-income communities will see resourcescontinue to dwindle and will have fewer options forimproving their quality of life. In this case, the risk ofsettling for the status quo represented a threat to thecommunities the foundations care about most.California Forward also showcases the value of funderscoordinating and collaborating in their advocacyefforts, rather than simply “co-funding.” Many leaders in L.A. County described their cam-paigns in a variety of issue areas as potentially “land-mark” and able to serve as a model for other commu-nities in the country. This includes work on affordablehousing, transit, education and environmental justice.However, there are many unpredictable twists andturns on the road to policy change. One leader lament-ed that “very few foundations can accurately assess thevalue of advocacy and organizing … Funders do notunderstand the policy process.” One funder noted,“Advocacy is intangible to a lot of funders because ofthe 10–15 year time horizon for change.” It is difficultfor advocacy and organizing groups to fit their goalsand strategies into a typical one- or two-year grantcycle. In the case of the LAX Enhancement Zone LivingWage Ordinance, LAANE and its allies could not havepredicted the litigation that prevented the ordinancefrom being implemented until two years after its pas-sage. Policy engagement and community organizing isa long-term commitment to a cause. By including theirStrengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities47grantees in the decision-making process and support-ing advocacy, organizing and community engagement,funders can truly be bold in addressing the challengesfacing L.A. County.B. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUNDERSAs this report demonstrates, when nonprofits advo-cate on behalf of and organize their constituents,communities in L.A. County reap concrete lastingbenefits. Yet, as many advocates and foundationleaders emphasized, the region faces a host ofintractable problems. A lack of affordable housing,inadequate public education, a limited public tran-sit infrastructure, uneven economic development,anti-immigrant sentiment and the recent anti-LGBTQ ballot initiative all present enormous chal-lenges to nonprofit advocates and their foundationpartners. These problems are exacerbated by thecurrent financial crisis that is squeezing local gov-ernment’s ability to meet residents’ basic needs.Nevertheless, foundations in Los Angeles Countyalso have an opportunity to respond to these prob-lems in a powerful way by supporting advocacy,organizing and civic engagement strategies that ele-vate those with the least power in the region to worktoward a more just society.More funders can take additional steps to bettersupport advocacy and organizing work. These stepsinclude streamlining the grant process so that theadministrative burden on the grantee is commensu-rate with the size of the grant, providing generaloperating support and multi-year commitments, andworking with their nonprofit partners to meet capac-ity needs and help their partners realize their fullpotential as advocates. Anthony Paranese of ACORNidentified the Solidago Foundation staff as makingan effort to understand the organization’s work out-side of the dichotomy of funder-grantee. “Their pro-gram officers actually engage you in conversationoutside the bureaucratic details to talk about yourtheory of change,” he said. Funders also can  tapinto existing grantees as resources to identify othereffective organizations, and indeed some of thegroups in the sample helped each other gain legiti-macy with funders. Based on the input of nonprofits and funders, andconsistent with Criteria for Philanthropy at its Best,NCRP recommends the following next steps to foun-dation leaders: 1. Increase the percentage of grant dollarsdevoted to advocacy, organizing and civicengagementSome funders recognize the significant returnoffered by investing in policy advocacy and commu-nity organizing and devote a substantial percentageof their grant dollars to this kind of work. Othersmay want to re-evaluate and raise their levels ofinvestment in these strategies, given their potentialfor tremendous impact. For a previous publication, NCRP analyzed datafrom the Foundation Center on 809 large nationalfoundations over a three-year time period and foundthat only 7 percent of those foundations give 25 per-cent or more of their grant dollars to support socialjustice.72 California foundations meeting this bench-mark were:> Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund> The John M. Lloyd Foundation> The California Endowment> Compton Foundation, Inc.> Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation> The California Wellness Foundation> Levi Strauss Foundation> The San Diego Foundation> The James Irvine Foundation> S.H. Cowell FoundationThese funders recognize the significant benefitsto communities that advocacy and organizing bring.If other funders increase the proportion of theirgrant dollars devoted to these strategies, they willincrease the capacity of underserved communitiesto engage in participatory democracy and con-tribute to solving the region’s pressing problems.Further, L.A. County is home to many new, smallerorganizations not featured in this report. Fundersthat increase their financial support for advocacyand organizing have the opportunity to invest in thefuture success of these emerging groups as well as inmore established organizations. Exemplary grantmakers provide more than theirown financial support; they also leverage their rela-tionships with other funders and potential policyallies. Many of the groups in the sample describedthe ways in which Liberty Hill Foundation has sup-ported their ability to expand their donor base.Marqueece Harris-Dawson of Community Coalitionsaid, “Liberty Hill Foundation has helped organizethe philanthropic community and bring Community48National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy49Coalition to funders’ attention. Thirty percent of ourindividual donors and funders can probably betraced back to Liberty Hill.”2. Engage the board and donors in dialogueabout how advocacy and organizing can helpachieve long-term goalsTrustees may not knowmuch about advocacyand organizing and maymistakenly believe thatfoundations cannot legal-ly fund such strategies.Sharing concrete exam-ples from this report withtrustees or major donorscan help demystify advo-cacy and organizing andencourage discussion ofhow these strategies canbe among a variety of approaches needed to achievechange on the issues funders care about. In additionto funding advocacy and organizing, foundationscan advance public policy priorities by leveragingtheir political capital, educating their peers andinforming public leaders and the media about criti-cal issues and potential solutions.Latonya Slack of the Irvine Foundation offered aperspective on why many funders do not supportadvocacy and organizing: “It comes down to fear,either of violating legal restrictions or of entering intoan activity with inherent uncertainties and risks.”  TheIrvine Foundation has educated staff and board onthe legal constraints related to funding advocacy and,by commissioning a paper on public policy grant-making,73 has deepened its understanding of effectivepublic policy and advocacy grantmaking strategies.For funders just embarking on exploring these strate-gies, education of trustees is key.At times, leadership change can present thechance for a foundation to explore new ways ofachieving its mission. In 2004, Antonia Hernandez,then president and general counsel of the MexicanAmerican Legal Defense and Educational Fund(MALDEF), became president and CEO of theCalifornia Community Foundation (CCF). Undernew leadership, CCF created a new strategic planwith a significant civic engagement component,now including activities around the 2010 Census,immigration integration and preschool advocacy.Twenty-two percent of CCF’s grantmaking is foradvocacy, organizing and civic engagement, and, asa community foundation, CCF is well positioned tofund and engage in advocacy work itself and main-tains guidelines for its own participation in policyissues. According to Hernandez, “CCF’s ten-yearstrategic plan serves as the foundation for our boardof directors’ commitment to undertake policy andadvocacy work in Los Angeles County. Building andmobilizing the public will be necessary to createsystemic change in the areas of interest to the foun-dation. The foundation’s board embraces advocacyand civic engagement as a central tenet of ourwork.” She further noted, “Over the past four years,CCF’s incremental levels of success in enabling thenonprofit, public and philanthropic sectors to devel-op solutions to critical issues such as affordablehousing, early childhood education and accessiblehealth care continue to inspire the board about thesignificance of our catalytic role in public policy.” Participating in a campaign also can build funderknowledge. As part of the campaign to increaseaccess to college preparatory courses in L.A. publicschools (“A-G” courses), InnerCity Struggle,Community Coalition, Alliance for a BetterCommunity and the United Way worked together topass the resolution. Through the campaign, theUnited Way saw the importance of advocacy andorganizing and began funding ICS for its communityorganizing work. Additionally, both CommunityCoalition and ICS noted the role of the United Way inhelping organizing groups gain entrée into the busi-ness community, educating donors about the workand identifying potential funding sources for thegroups. As a result of their involvement inCommunities for Education Equity, the United Way isStrengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities“It comes down to fear, either of violating legal restrictions or ofentering into an activity with inherent uncertainties and risks” – Latonya Slack of the James Irvine Foundation on why many funders do not support advocacy and organizing50now seeking to integrate advocacy into programsbeyond its education work. Elise Buik, CEO, UnitedWay of Greater L.A. observed, “Once we adopted‘creating pathways out of poverty’ as our mantra, wesaw we couldn’t fund our way out of poverty.Focusing on real, long-term change meant new strate-gies beyond grantmaking – research, convening andmobilizing our various partners into new alliancesthat advocate for policy reform. The pivot for us wasthinking long-term, thinking change not just charityand thinking about putting our brand in service ofbig-scale change. Our board and key volunteers areexcited to be forging this new path – I think the bold-ness of the challenge inspires them to step up.”Nonprofit partners are often the resident expertson a topic and can educate foundation leaders.Communities for a Better Environment (CBE) hosts“Toxic Tours” to inform community leaders aboutthe targeting of lower-income and ethnic minoritycommunities for toxic waste sites, power plants, andother high-pollution activities. Bill Gallegosexplained that many funders do not understand howenvironmental racism affects their constituents. “It’sa term; they do not know what it means or how itplays out in reality. All [foundation] board membersshould get out and see these sites.”Funders also are seeking ways to determinewhich organizations are operating in an effectiveway and building power in the community. Said onenonprofit leader, “As a field in community organiz-ing, we have not built an effective tool to measure[effectiveness].” Another said, “A lot of the majorfunders don’t get organizing, so they force you toput things into terms their board can understandinstead of figuring how to accomplish policychanges through community organizing. It would begreat to have more of a ‘meet me halfway’ approachwhere [funders] make an effort to understand ourwork and value it for its potential to make change.”This report offers concrete examples of successesand can guide funders in discussing with theirboards the value of advocacy and organizing.3. Support collaboration that strengthensadvocacy and organizing Exemplary grantmakers can help build the case forpolicy change by lending their expertise andresources to collaboration that strengthens the advo-cacy and organizing work of their nonprofit part-ners. As Housing L.A. demonstrates, organic collab-oration has tremendous potential, and philanthropicleaders often can best support this type of collabo-ration with minimal strategy intervention. Fundersalso can play a constructive role in the early stagesof collaboration, as Liberty Hill Foundation didwhen it supported the convening of the GREEN LAcoalition, donating stafftime and taking on muchof the heavy logisticallifting. However, fundersalso must be willing totrust their nonprofit part-ners to identify goals andstrategies for the coali-tion as part of an inclu-sive planning process. One nonprofit leadersuggested that fundersinterested in supportingcoalition work create a designated pot of fundingwith an expedited process for disbursement.Sometimes coalitions are responding to an oppor-tunistic moment; by the time the funder is able todisburse the money, the members of the coalitionhave moved on or the window of opportunity forpolicy change has closed. Another challenge is thetypically short-term nature of funding cycles.Investing in coalition work can be a long-term com-mitment. One leader involved with Housing L.A.said, “If [a mixed income housing ordinance] pass-es next summer, it will have been a three year cam-paign. It is very difficult to predict when a policywill pass. We could not have predicted the legalchallenge [that defeated the original ordinance] orthe economic collapse.” Funders should considermaking multi-year investments in coalitions andNational Committee for Responsive Philanthropy“Focusing on real, long-term change meant new strategies beyondgrantmaking – research, convening and mobilizing our variouspartners into new alliances that advocate for policy reform.” – Elise Buik, CEO, United Way of Greater L.A. 51work with their partners to develop interim bench-marks to measure progress.Another way funders can better support coalitionwork is by helping build the capacity of individualorganizations within the coalition. Liberty HillFoundation has supported L.A. Voice in developingits individual donor strategy, increasing internalcapacity and by extension its ability to contribute tocoalition work. Community Coalition has partneredwith other organizations in the state to address thelack of funding for nonprofits led by ethnic minori-ties. The coalition organized a funders’ panel for 32organizations led by African Americans and Latinosto help develop their readiness to apply for funding.By supporting minority-led organizations, funderscan develop these groups’ ability to sit at the tablewith white-led policy and organizing groups. Inlight of the demographics of L.A. County, it is partic-ularly relevant that funders be cognizant of the needfor increased funding of nonwhite-led nonprofits.4. Work together to foster philanthropic coop-eration and shared learningThe issues the 15 organizations tackle on a dailybasis are daunting. Just as no one organization canmake progress on these issues alone, funders tooshould work together to not only co-fund but coop-erate and plan. For example, L.A. County remainslargely racially segregated, with much of the whitepopulation occupying the coast and wealthy com-munities. L.A. has a history of racial tension, andfollowing the 1992 riots, L.A. Urban Fundersemerged committed to healing the racial fissures inthe community that the riots had exposed and sup-porting equitable economic development in the city.While L.A. Urban Funders has closed its doors, itrepresented a historic partnership between founda-tions and nonprofits dedicated to addressing the dis-parities that the 1992 civil unrest highlighted. It alsorepresented an unprecedented philanthropic collab-orative effort. California Forward represents onecontemporary collaborative effort.Los Angeles-based funders will see better resultsif they communicate with each other and withstatewide and national funders to effectively lever-age their resources in addressing the pressing issuesfacing L.A. County. Better communication amongfunders would benefit both foundations and theirnonprofit partners. To this end Southern CaliforniaGrantmakers is working to educate its membership,nurture philanthropic involvement in public policyand encourage collaboration in the field. “SouthernCalifornia Grantmakers is increasing funder collab-oration through convening peer learning groups andproviding opportunities for focused conversationson issues such as place based grantmaking, improv-ing communications between the public sector andgrantmakers, strengthening nonprofit finances, andthe intersection between public policy and philan-thropy,” said Sushma Raman, president of SCG. Recently L.A. Mayor Villaraigosa established anOffice of Strategic Partnerships (OSP), which servesas the designated liaison between the city’s execu-tive branch and the nonprofit and foundation com-munity. OSP is a public-private partnership withingovernment with three foundations – Ahmanson,Annenberg, and Weingart – funding half the cost.Aileen Adams, Deputy Mayor for the Office ofStrategic Partnerships, explained, “The role of thisnew office is to give a strong voice to the philan-thropic community and nonprofits within govern-ment, to search together for creative solutions, andto form strong partnerships among diverse sectorsthat address common problems – and achieve com-mon dreams. Strategic partnerships enable all sec-tors to enhance their services and magnify theirimpact.” Some of OSP’s major projects include:forging successful place-based strategies; overseeingthe city’s effort to ensure an accurate 2010 censuscount; facilitating the work of nonprofits through anonprofit advisory group; expanding the City’s GangReduction and Youth Development Program;enhancing city–county government cooperation;and helping the mayor’s Partnership for L.A. Schoolsimprove low-performing schools. 5. Invest in organizational capacity and anonprofit advocacy infrastructure for SouthernCaliforniaThis report features a cross-section of highly sophis-ticated advocacy and grassroots groups in L.A.County. Some of the groups, such as CommunityCoalition and the L.A. Gay and Lesbian Center,began as service organizations and evolved toinclude advocacy among their strategies for servingtheir communities. None of the groups in the sam-ple achieved their current size and scope overnight;it took time, experience and investments in organi-Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities 52zational capacity. The current recession has led tomany funders propping up service organizations inthe face of declining public funds for much-neededsocial services. If those social service groups wereable to advocate for their needs and address sys-temic problems, the impact of the current crisis per-haps could be mitigated. L.A. County is home tomany nascent organizations with great potential,and foundations would be wise to help developthose organizations by investing in their capacityand in a nonprofit advocacy infrastructure forSouthern California.Funders also can contribute to strategy throughinvestments in research and program assessment.Jared Rivera of L.A. Voice PICO described the wayin which a funder research project changed the waythe organization engages voters. In 2006, the JamesIrvine Foundation launched the California VotesInitiative, which combined extensive voter outreachefforts with research design to understand better theeffects of various outreach strategies.74 Irvine pairedseveral organizations, including SCOPE, APALC andL.A. Voice PICO, with a researcher from YaleUniversity who helped the groups conduct experi-ments to study the efficacy of their get out the voteefforts. As a result, L.A. Voice PICO eliminated anyvoter engagement work that doesn’t involve face-to-face contact and has dramatically improved theirget out the vote strategy. “That’s something we neverwould have been able to do on our own,” saidRivera.In 2009, The California Endowment releasedWhat Makes an Effective Advocacy Organization? AFramework for Determining Advocacy Capacity,prepared by TCC Group. The purpose of the report isto help funders assess and enhance the advocacycapacity and readiness of their grantees, addressingcapacity at the organizational rather than individualleadership level. Included is a detailed logic modelto help foundations determine the advocacy capac-ity of their nonprofit partners and identify points ofintervention to better support their growth. By utiliz-ing this and other resources, funders can make pos-itive contributions to the ability of their grantees toeffectively organize and advocate on behalf of con-stituents.Even established organizations have capacityneeds. KIWA organizes Korean Americans andLatinos. Executive director Danny Park noted thatfunders are interested insupporting their work,but don’t always appreci-ate the amount of effort ittakes to provide simulta-neous translation andwork across differencesin national history andculture in multiple com-munities. “A lot of foun-dations are excited aboutcross-ethnic organizingand the work. But asmall project requirestwo to three times theeffort to accomplishbecause of the challenges of multiethnic organizing,and foundations sometimes don’t fully realize this.”In addition to fostering philanthropic collabora-tion to strengthen their own work, foundations caninvest in the nonprofit advocacy infrastructure ofSouthern California. This would facilitate furthercollaboration among nonprofit groups, providespace for technical assistance and professionaldevelopment activities, and importantly, build thecapacity of area nonprofits to engage in public pol-icy, organizing and civic engagement. Several localstakeholders expressed concern that funders arevery good at supporting the capacity of their owngrantees, but few are looking at the capacity needsof emerging advocacy and organizing groups or ofthe nonprofit sector more broadly. As noted earlierin this report, UCLA experts recommended nonprof-its engage in more widespread advocacy, but manywill need new skills and guidance to do so. FundersNational Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyA lot of foundations are excited about cross-ethnic organizing andthe work. But a small project requires two to three times the effort to accomplish because of the challenges of multiethnicorganizing, and foundations sometimes don’t fully realize this.” – Danny Park, Executive Director, Koreantown Immigrant Workers 53have an interest in supporting capacity beyond thatof their own grantees; marginalized communitiesbenefit when the sector as a whole has the capacityto engage in advocacy, organizing and civic engage-ment. Specifically, foundations can work with exist-ing management support organizations (MSOs) inthe region to improve coordination of services andenhance their capacity to provide training to non-profits on how to add these strategies to their mis-sion and activities. 6. Provide general operating support andmulti-year grantsEffective funders maximize their grantees’ flexibilityand stability by providing multi-year and generaloperating support. According to NCRP’s previousanalysis of Foundation Center data on 809 founda-tions, 11 California foundations provided more than50 percent of their grant dollars for general operat-ing support:> William K. Bowes, Jr. Foundation> The California Wellness Foundation> D & DF Foundation> Grousbeck Family Foundation> The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation> The Larry L. Hillblom Foundation, Inc.> Jaqueline Hume Foundation> Thomas and Dorothy Leavy Foundation> Dan Murphy Foundation> Mary Stuart Rogers Foundation> The Thomas and Stacey Siebel FoundationTwenty-two California Funders provided at least50 percent of grant dollars as multi-year funding:> The Ahmanson Foundation> Bella Vista Foundation> The Bolthouse Foundation> The Bothin Foundation> The California Endowment> The California Wellness Foundation> The Cleo Foundation> Community Foundation Silicon Valley> Energy Foundation> The Gamble Foundation> Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation> Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund> Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund> The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation> The James Irvine Foundation> The Kimball Foundation> The John M. Lloyd Foundation> Peninsula Community Foundation> The San Diego Foundation > The San Francisco Foundation> Santa Barbara Foundation> The Thomas and Stacey Siebel FoundationAs nonprofits make strategic decisions aboutadvocacy campaigns, capacity needs and how tobalance the immediate basic needs of their con-stituents with their advocacy and organizing work,their funding partners can be of greatest help byinvesting in a way that enables grantees to achievethe highest possible impact. In addition to increas-ing the proportion of grant dollars designated foradvocacy and organizing, funders can aid their non-profit partners by providing flexible and stableresources to support their strategic efforts. The cur-rent economic crisis has led many funders to cutback grantmaking in order to preserve their ownlong-term viability. Particularly in Los AngelesCounty, it is essential that funders instead considermaintaining or increasing flexible, ongoing supportfor advocacy and organizing. NCRP and Southern California Grantmakers areavailable to help L.A. County funders and nonprofitleaders discuss next steps for supporting effectiveadvocacy, organizing and civic engagement tostrengthen their communities.

Conclusion As this report demonstrates, analyzing a small sam-ple of diverse and effective organizations in LosAngeles County revealed substantial benefits for vulner-able communities, including more than $6.88 billion inmonetary gains as well as many non-monetizedimpacts. The organizations included in this report uti-lized a range of advocacy, organizing and civic engage-ment strategies to accomplish their impressive wins.Sophisticated and savvy in their methods, the organiza-tions have managed to achieve success in the face ofwhat is often a highly challenging policy environment.Yet, as this report also demonstrates, the challenges fac-ing L.A. County are tremendous. While not insurmount-able, they nonetheless demand long-term commitmentin order to address limited public investments anddeeply entrenched inequalities in the region. L.A. County funders have many positive grantmak-ing and capacity building models that support advoca-cy and organizing, and by increasing investments inthese strategies, foundations will add to the ability oftheir nonprofit partners to effect change. In the currenteconomic crisis, many funders are seeking ways tostretch their dollars. Grants made in support of advoca-cy and organizing that promotes justice and equity go along way toward improving society for the communitiesand issues funders care about most. Investments in thiswork to address disparities today will pay off in long-term benefits for all Angelenos.Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities 561.

In 1992, a jury in Los Angeles acquitted four white policeofficers who had been caught on videotape repeatedlybeating Rodney King, whom they had pursued in a pro-longed car chase. The verdict outraged county residentsand sparked ethnic tensions, causing violent riots to erupt.After three days, 55 people had died, 2,300 were injured,and 1,100 buildings had been destroyed.

Funding advocacy and advocates is the most direct route to supporting enduring socialchange for the poor, the disenfranchised and the most vulnerable among us, includ-ing the youngest and oldest in our communities.—Gara LaMarche, President and CEOThe Atlantic Philanthropies*The National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy (NCRP) aims to ensure that philanthropic institu-tions practice Philanthropy at Its Best® – philanthropy that serves the public good, supports nonprofiteffectiveness and responds to those in our society with the least wealth, opportunity and power. NCRPbelieves that one of the most effective ways to address the needs of the disenfranchised is by providing sup-port for advocacy, community organizing and civic engagement. NCRP’s Criteria for Philanthropy at Its Best, published in March 2009, challenges grantmakers to pro-mote the American values of opportunity and inclusion by contributing to a strong, participatory democra-cy that engages all communities.  One way they can accomplish that is by providing at least 25 percent oftheir grant dollars for advocacy, organizing and civic engagement. This aspirational goal is one of ten bench-marks in Criteria. Many grantmakers invest in advocacy, organizing and civic engagement as a way to advance their mis-sions and strengthen communities. A sizable number of foundations, however, have not seriously consid-ered investing in these strategies, partly because they have difficulty measuring impact and fully understand-ing how effective these strategies can be. The Grantmaking for Community Impact Project (GCIP) address-es these concerns by highlighting the positive impact that communities have seen through funder-support-ed nonpartisan advocacy and organizing. To provide foundations with useful information that can help them consider supporting these strategiesat higher levels, each GCIP report documents impact and demonstrates how advocacy, community organ-izing and civic engagement result in community-wide benefits and can advance a foundation’s mission.
