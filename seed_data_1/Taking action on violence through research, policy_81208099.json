The Centre for Global Health and Health Equity organized a forum in 2014 to identify: (1)\npriority issues related to violence affecting different population groups in Canada, and (2) strategies to take action\non priority issues to reduce violence-related health inequities in Canada. In this paper, we present findings from the\nroundtable discussions held at the Forum, offer insights on the socio-political implications of these findings, and\nprovide recommendations for action to reduce violence through research, policy and practice.\nMethods: Over 60 academic researchers, health and social service agency staff, community advocates and graduate\nstudents attended the daylong Forum, which included presentations on structural violence, community violence,\ngender-based violence, and violence against marginalized groups. Detailed notes taken at the roundtables were\nanalyzed by the first author using a thematic analysis technique.\nFindings: The thematic analysis identified four thematic areas: 1) structural violence perpetuates interpersonal\nviolence - the historical, social, political and economic marginalization that contributes to personal and community\nviolence. 2) social norms of gender-based violence—the role of dominant social norms in perpetuating the practice\nof violence, especially towards women, children and older adults; 3) violence prevention and mitigation programs—the\nneed for policy and programming to address violence at the individual/interpersonal, community, and societal levels;\nand 4) research gaps—the need for comprehensive research evidence made up of systematic reviews, community-\nbased intervention and evaluation of implementation research to identify effective programming to address violence.\nConclusions: The proceedings from the Global Health and Health Equity Forum underscored the importance of\nrecognizing violence as a public health issue that requires immediate and meaningful communal and structural\ninvestment to break its historic cycles. Based on our thematic analysis and literature review, four recommendations are\noffered: (1) Support and adopt policies to prevent or reduce structural violence; (2) Adopt multi-pronged strategies to\ntransform dominant social norms associated with violence; (3) Establish standards and ensure adequate funding for\nviolence prevention programs and services; and (4) Fund higher level ecological research on violence prevention and\nmitigation.\nKeywords: Structural violence, Social policy, Immigration, Community services, Neoliberalism* Correspondence: i.hyman@utoronto.ca\n1Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2016 The Author(s).

Global Health Research and Policy  (2016) 1:6 Page 2 of 9Background\nViolence is a critical public health problem associated\nwith compromised health and social suffering that are\npreventable. It is also a complex phenomenon that in-\nvolves a spectrum of behavioral and social interactions\nthat vary across the lifespan and different social, polit-\nical and economic contexts. The 2014 World Health\nOrganization (WHO) Global Status Report on Violence\nPrevention indicates that the overall rate for victims of\nhomicide worldwide in 2012 was 6.7 per 100,000 popu-\nlation [47]. While fatal violence is alarming to society\nand traumatic to the victims’ families and loved ones, it\nconstitutes a small portion of interpersonal violence.\nNon-fatal physical, sexual and psychological violence\nmake up the majority of interpersonal violence and\nthese particularly affect children, women and seniors.\nFor instance, an estimated 30 % of adult women world-\nwide experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an\nintimate partner (IPV) at some point in their lives [46],\n22.6 % experienced physical abuse, and 36.3 % experi-\nenced emotional abuse as a child [33]. Data also show\nthat 6 % of older adults reported significant abuse in\nthe past month [8]. Furthermore, incidents of non-fatal\nviolence are often under-reported, thus, actual rates are\nmuch higher.\nIn 2014, only few of the 133 countries surveyed by\nthe WHO implemented prevention programs at a\nlevel commensurate with the scale and severity of\nthe problem [47]. Canada fell short in elder abuse\nprevention, victim law reforms, and initiatives to pro-\nmote gender equity [47]. The WHO [47] recom-\nmended that effective and sustainable global violence\nprevention efforts must be comprehensive and tackle\na wide range of social conditions and structural de-\nterminants that fuel violence; that is, economic\nmarginalization, ageism and gender inequality. The\nWHO’s recommendations imply that the notion of\nviolence must be understood beyond interpersonal\nviolence to make visible the impact of structural\nviolence.\nStructural violence, a term first coined by Johan\nGaltung [19], is defined as the difference between the\npotential and actual physical, mental, social and spir-\nitual wellbeing of persons affected. Galtung asserted\nthat interpersonal violence can only be understood in\nthe context of structural violence, which is systemic\nin nature and often remains invisible. Expanding on\nGaltung’s work, Paul Farmer [17] illustrated that inequit-\nable distribution of power and resources across different\ngroups in society produces differential life chances that\nshape their everyday lived experiences. Wong [40] con-\nsiders structural violence as a system of interlocking op-\npressions manifested in the form of social and economic\ndeprivation, limiting marginalized people’s ability to reachtheir full physical, emotional, cultural and spiritual poten-\ntial. She also emphasized that structural violence is an\navoidable cause of health disparities that can be addressed\nthrough research, policy and practice.\nThe use of structural violence as an analytical lens to\nunderstand health disparities is aligned with evidence\ngenerated by research on social determinants of health\nin a neoliberal advanced capitalist globalized economy\n(see [4, 10]). As in other advanced capitalist countries,\nthe 1970s marked a turning point in Canada from a\npost-war Keynesian Welfare state that focused on redis-\ntributive justice policies, to a free-market neoliberal state\nthat emphasizes competitive individualism and con-\nsumption as a source of identity and means for social\nparticipation [9]. It is important to note that neoliberal-\nism did not translate into total withdrawal of the state.\nRather, neoliberalism has transformed state intervention\nfrom redistributive justice of social welfare for the poor\nto redistribution of wealth from the ordinary people to\nthe elite; for example, in the form of bailouts or corpor-\nate welfare [1]. In Canada, neoliberal public policies and\npractices resulted in reduced access to welfare and the\nsocial security system. Examples include, welfare-to-\nwork programs that required education and employment\nparticipation in order to receive benefits: deregulation of\nthe market, privatization of public services, restructuring\nof the Unemployment Insurance program to what is\nnow known as Employment Insurance: and the replace-\nment of the Canadian Assistance Plan by the Canada\nHealth and Social Transfer [3]. To a large extent, neo-\nliberal practice perpetuates structural violence against\nvulnerable groups. For instance, neoliberal discourse of\nindividual responsibility further marginalizes women\nwho are welfare recipients when they are constructed\nas the cause of government fiscal deficits [6], or por-\ntrayed in the media and our popular imagination as lazy\nand undeserving freeloaders. Structural violence em-\nbedded in public policy and social institutions is invis-\nible and yet powerful in perpetuating interpersonal\nviolence, which is deemed to be private, random, and\nindividual events. The interlocking cycle of structural\nand interpersonal violence disempowers individuals and\ncommunities, particularly those marginalized at the in-\ntersections of gender, race and class [5], and reinforces\nhealth disparities [16, 39].\nRyerson University’ Centre for Global Health and\nHealth Equity, in dialogue with external research net-\nworks, organized and implemented a forum to explore\nissues relating to violence. The objectives of the Forum\nwere to identify: (1) priority issues related to violence af-\nfecting different population groups in Canada, and (2)\nstrategies to take action on priority issues to reduce\nviolence-related health inequities in Canada. In this\npaper, we present findings from discussion and dialogue\nHyman et al. Global Health Research and Policy  (2016) 1:6 Page 3 of 9at the Forum, offer insights on the socio-political impli-\ncations of these findings, and provide recommendations\nfor action to reduce violence through research, policy\nand practice.\nDescription of the forum and methods\nThe Global Health and Equity Forum was held in To-\nronto, Canada in 2014. Invitations were sent to hospitals,\ncommunity health centres, non-profit community orga-\nnizations working with vulnerable groups, universities,\nand public health units in the Greater Toronto Area. Over\n60 researchers, health and social service agency staff, com-\nmunity advocates and graduate students attended the day-\nlong Forum, which included presentations on structural\nviolence, community violence, gender-based violence, and\nviolence against marginalized groups. The presentations\nwere followed by five concurrent roundtable discussions.\nParticipants were invited to join one of five roundtables\nthat interested them: children, youth, women, men and\nolder adults. Each roundtable was attended by 10-12 par-\nticipants; it was facilitated by a member of Centre for Glo-\nbal Health and Health Equity team and the discussion\nlasted approximately an hour. Being more participant-\ndriven than researcher-driven, the Roundtable were con-\nsidered to be an effective strategy for promoting critical\ndialogues. The composition of each Roundtable is pre-\nsented in Table 1.\nRoundtable participants were asked to discuss priority\nissues related to violence based on their current profes-\nsional experience and observations, and identify strat-\negies for addressing these violence-related priorities and\nresulting health inequities. A graduate student or mem-\nber of Centre for Global Health and Health Equity team\nwas assigned to each roundtable as the note-taker to\ncapture the composition of each roundtable group, and\nnotes on the discussion. Notes from the roundtables\nwere circulated to the facilitator of each roundtable for\nreview and to insert additional reflective comments.\nUpon receiving all the reviewed notes, the first author\nused thematic analysis as the method to identify andTable 1 Roundtable Participants\nType and No.\nof Participants\nChildren Youth Women Men Older Adults\nFacilitator 1 1 1 1 1\nNote-takers 1 1 2 1 1\nHealth/Social service\nproviders\n1 1 4 3 3\nCommunity advocates 3 3 2 2 3\nUndergraduate students 0 0 1 3 0\nGraduate students 1 1 2 1 1\nOther 4 4 4 4 1organize findings into relevant themes and categories\n[34]. These themes were shared and discussed with the\nresearch team members who facilitated the roundtables\nto reach analytical consensus that inform this paper.\nFindings from the forum\nThrough thematic analysis, we identified four priority\nareas from the participants’ discussions:\n1) structural violence perpetuates interpersonal\nviolence\n2) social norms of gender-based violence\n3) violence prevention and mitigation programs; and\n4) research gaps.\n1) Structural violence perpetuates interpersonal\nviolence\nThe notion of structural violence was used by\nForum participants to describe the historical, social\nand economic marginalization that contributes to\ninterpersonal and community violence. Participants\nin many of the roundtable groups provided examples\nof factors related to structural violence, including\npoverty, gender inequity, transphobia, homophobia,\nracism, and other forms of discrimination and social\nexclusion. For instance, participants at the Women’s\nRoundtable identified the association between\ninterpersonal violence and systemic discrimination.\nThey suggested that underlying social inequities in\nthe forms of women’s economic and legal\ndependency on men, economic and educational\nexclusion, and neoliberal practice which limits\naccess and opportunities, all contribute indirectly to\nviolence against women. As one participant\nexplained, “People will deny that patriarchal values\nare still an issue today. We must shed light on the\nroot causes; the sociological values that are\nembedded into our society and behavior (direct quote\ncaptured by note-taker).” Similarly, participants at the\nMen’s Roundtable highlighted men’s differential access\nto privilege and power when compared to women and\nchildren. However, participants also highlighted that\nin Canada and other White settler societies, not all\nmen share similar access to privilege and power. Men\nof marginalized social positions experience structural\nviolence in the form of neocolonialism, racism,\nhomophobia, transphobia, ableism, economic\nmarginalization and other intersecting oppressions\nthat compromise their health and social wellbeing.\nAt the Older Adult’s Roundtable, participants raised\nconcerns about immigration policies, particularly with\nrespect to sponsorship, which combine with racism,\nclassism and ageism, to foster power imbalance and\ndependency in immigrant families. Participants at the\nHyman et al. Global Health Research and Policy  (2016) 1:6 Page 4 of 9Children and Youth Roundtable recommended that it\nis important for all people, but especially parents and\nfamilies, to become aware of the impacts of structural\nviolence on access to safe living environments,\neducation, and aspiration for children and youth.\nAn overarching theme that emerged across all\nroundtables was the importance of addressing\nviolence at the level of public policy. Participants\nidentified the need to target policy makers and\ngovernment leaders to raise awareness of the impact\nof structural violence in the forms of policies and\nlaws, and to push for commitment of resources to\naddress the structural forms of violence (e.g., poverty,\nracism, sexism) because education alone is not\nsufficient to reduce violence-related inequities. Many\nparticipants identified the lack of intersectoral\napproaches (i.e., involving health, employment, social,\neducational, housing and criminal justice sectors) that\nrequire commitment and coordinated efforts across\ndifferent levels of government and different ministries\nor departments. For example, effective strategies to\nreduce youth related violence must include increasing\naccess to inclusive employment and educational\nopportunities for youth and providing financial and\nsocial supports for parents to help reduce the risks\nthat are associated with violence and inequitable\noutcomes. Participants also suggested that decision-\nmakers and administrators of institutions (e.g.,\nhospitals, police, group homes, and the child welfare\nsystem) must examine how structural violence is\nproduced and sustained through their organizational\npolicies and practices that act as barriers to\ndisempower individuals and communities. For\nexample, racial profiling or the discriminatory\npractice by law enforcement officials to target\nindividuals for suspicion of crime based on the\nindividuals’ racialized background, ethnicity,\nreligion or national origin is found to be common\npractice in Canada [7, 35].2) Social norms of gender-based violence\nParticipants across the different roundtables\nidentified social norms as a powerful force behind\ninterpersonal violence in different populations.\nFor example, at the Women’s Roundtable,\nparticipants noted that in Canada and elsewhere,\nthere exists a culture of gender-based violence\nmanifested in a culture of rape and victim blaming\nthat is very challenging to shift. Women continue to\nbe objectified in the media, which produces and\nreproduces stereotypes, reinforces power\ndifferentials and normalizes violence against women\n(VAW). As one participant stated, “Women in\nadvertisements become objects. They lose their faceand humanism, which is the first step towards\nmaking violence more acceptable (direct quote\nrecorded by note-taker).” Women felt that gender-\nbased violence is embedded in Canadian social\nnorms that do not value the equitable participation\nof women in leadership capacities.\nAt the Men’s Roundtable, participants identified the\nneed to engage men, especially marginalized men, to\n(re)define “what it means to be men”. They\nsuggested that gendered norms often condone\nviolence as an expected masculine role expectations\nand practice, which reinforce self-harm and violence\nagainst women and other men (e.g., violence in\nsports, dating violence, violence against gay men).\nMen who experience social and economic\nmarginalization are often pushed into street economies\nthat increased their involvement in violence.\nParticipants at the Youth Roundtable highlighted that\nchildren and youth are also expected to fit with\ngendered norms and role expectation. In addition, they\nsuggested that children and youth often encounter an\nadditional layer of social norms based on age. Forum\nparticipants reported, based on their professional\nexperience, that societal norms and adult judgments\n(e.g., from parents, teachers, and community workers)\noften produce negative stereotypes about children and\nyouth that are stigmatizing and disempowering;\nchildren and youth in marginalized communities bear\nthe brunt of these stereotypes.\nMany participants felt that shifting broader social\nnorms and gendered expectations is a necessary\nprerequisite to the adoption of laws and policies to\nreduce structural violence and interpersonal\nviolence. For example, social norms for gender-\nbased interactions are taken up by children as they\nobserve adults’ involvement and responses to\nviolence. Furthermore, participants identified the\nneed to deconstruct the neoliberal agenda and\npractice in which violence is constructed as\nindividual behaviors, and freedom from violence is\nachieved through individual vigilance and efforts.\nThey emphasized the need to make visible that\ninterpersonal violence is produced through power\nrelations and social structures, and the negative\nimpact of intergenerational violence, as experienced\nby the Indigenous peoples of Canada and elsewhere.\nThese forms of violence, especially among\nIndigenous populations, must be addressed through\ndeliberate efforts based on the principles of social\njustice and equity.3) Violence prevention and mitigation programs\nForum participants noted that changing dominant\nsocial norms requires strategies of critical dialogue,\nHyman et al. Global Health Research and Policy  (2016) 1:6 Page 5 of 9stakeholder engagement, and political action at\nmultiple levels: (1) at the societal level, there is a\nneed to make visible how neoliberal practice,\nmanifested in current regressive social welfare\npolicies, reinforces structural violence that\ncontributes to social and health inequities, including\ninterpersonal violence; (2) at the community level,\nthere is a need for sector leaders, service providers,\nactivists and community members alike to recognize\nviolence, in its myriad forms, as a priority for health\nand social wellbeing requiring collective action; and\n(3) at the individual and interpersonal level, there is\na need for critical understanding of the (re)production\nof dominant social norms and gendered expectations\nthat normalize violence behaviors.\nParticipants also spoke about the advantage of\nengaging broader and more diverse stakeholder\ngroups - including the media, faith leaders, health\nand social service providers, researchers, policy-\nmakers, community members (including older\nadults, women, men, children and youth),\nadvocates - as agents of change in transforming\nsocial norms that perpetuate violence. Although\nForum participants recognized that most victims of\nintimate partner violence are women and most\nabusers are men, they considered it necessary to\nengage men in politicized popular education\nstrategies that interrogate the practice of violence\nagainst women in the historical, social, economic\nand political contexts. They also emphasized the\nimportance of promoting critical community\ndialogue about hegemonic masculinities and the\nconsistent use of gender equity messages by leaders\nand influential figures.\nOn a pragmatic note, Forum participants advocated\nfor educational and skills development programs for\nthe primary prevention of interpersonal violence.\nExamples provided by participants included school-\nbased and community-based educational\nprogramming for children and youth that focus on\ngender relations and gender identities; family\ndynamics; healthy relationships; anger management,\nas well as supporting children and youth to develop\nskills in recognizing problematic behaviors\nassociated with violence and abuse in the home\nenvironment, personal relationships, and beyond.\nOthers identified training for health and social\nservice providers as critical to improving consistency\nand comfort levels in the screening of individuals\nexperiencing abuse and in providing inclusive and\nculturally safe care.\nParticipants at the Women’s Roundtable\nrecommended educating young women and men on\nVAW help address the general belief among youngergeneration that the issue of VAW has been resolved\nor is no longer relevant. They also suggested that\neducational programs do not focus only on VAW.\nAs one participant shared, “You can teach the\nmakeup of a respectful relationship and educate\nabout conflict resolution without even having to\nmention violence”.\nParticipants at the Men’s Roundtable recommended\nstrategies and programming designed specifically for\nboys and men that focus on masculine identities,\nself-love, and mutually empowering relationships.\nThey suggested the use of cross-sector partnerships\nthat involve leaders and mentors from diverse\nsectors (e.g., arts, media, sports) to encourage boys\nand men in expressing their stress and negative\nemotions through non-threatening or non-harmful\noutlets such as martial arts and sports. They also\nemphasized the importance of providing safe\ngender-specific spaces for boys and men to critically\ndeconstruct masculine expectations such as\ntoughness, stoicism, and emotional disconnectedness\nas ways to promote their health and social wellbeing.\nAt the same time, some participants identified\nmandatory community programs for male abusers as\nan important mitigating strategy to reduce VAW. It\nis recognized that the evidence to date to support\nthis strategy is inconclusive.4) Research gaps on violence\nForum participants identified numerous research\ngaps related to violence. They felt that there is a\nneed for comprehensive evidence derived from:\nsystematic reviews on violence; community-based\nresearch that capture different forms of violence at\nthe grassroots level; community-based interventions\nthat inform violence prevention practice; and\nevaluation research on multi-sectoral services for\nindividuals experiencing violence. Participants also\nhighlighted the importance of implementation\nresearch, which provide evidence-informed strategies\nfor effective program adoption and adaptation to\nreduce violence.\nThere was consensus among participants on the\nneed for research that identify and evaluate\npromising practices in violence prevention and\nmitigation. Furthermore, participants emphasized\nthe need to translate this research evidence into\nproducts that are readily available and accessible to\npolicy-makers and decision-makers in order to\ninform policy and practice. Some examples of\ncomprehensive implementation evidences include:\nwhat works for different age-specific and gender-\nspecific populations in different communities (e.g.,\nneighbourhoods, ethno-specific, socio-economic);\nHyman et al. Global Health Research and Policy  (2016) 1:6 Page 6 of 9and how to create relevant and effective social\nmarketing messages for different populations.\nForum participants recommended the use of\ncommunity-based and participatory action research\nto explore the experiences of violence in diverse\npopulations and to capture perspectives of service\nproviders and other community stakeholders. They\nwere also aware of the challenges and barriers in\nestablishing meaningful and sustainable community-\nresearch partnerships due to the historical level of\ncommunity distrust and the potential competing\ninterests among the stakeholder groups, particularly\nin the current context of neoliberal practice that\npromotes individualistic competitiveness, and the\ndiminishing resources for non-profit organizations.Discussion\nThe priority issues for Canada raised by the Forum par-\nticipants were consistent with current global scholarship\nand practice in violence prevention and mitigation. The\nrecognition of interpersonal violence as a manifestation\nof structural violence is critical in shifting the focus of\nblame from marginalized communities that have been\nfurther victimized by neoliberal practice holds govern-\nment and institutions accountable for the inequitable\ndistribution of power and resources that produces and\nreproduces violence in the first place. This is especially\ntrue in Indigenous communities where (neo)colonialism,\nresulting in imposed loss of land, languages and cultures,\nand intergenerational trauma, has and continues to pose\ndevastating impact on indigenous people’s individual and\ncollective health and wellbeing, as evidenced in the high\nrates of poverty, unemployment, substance use, low edu-\ncational attainment, family violence, disproportionate\nburden of physical and mental illnesses, and premature\ndeaths (Health [2, 21, 23, 26]).\nThe second priority issue identified was consistent\nwith existing evidences that demonstrate the strong\nassociation between dominant social norms and vio-\nlent practices; for example, patriarchy and corporal\npunishment; gender inequities and normalized VAW;\nhegemonic masculinities and violence against gay men\n[24, 31, 37]. There is abundant empirical evidence to\nillustrate the perpetuating cycle of social norms and\nviolence: values and beliefs that condone violence are\nshaped and reinforced by patriarchal ideologies; they,\nin turn, contribute to and perpetuate violent behav-\niours at the micro- (individual), meso- (community)\nand macro- (societal) levels and promote a greater toler-\nance of men’s violent behaviors [11, 28, 38]. Notions of\nmale honor, male dominance, female subordination, fe-\nmale modesty and female chastity are exemplars of how\npatriarchal beliefs and fundamentalist religious doctrines\nintersect to perpetuate and sanction VAW [14, 20, 37].Research evidence also suggests that children who witness\nviolence or are victims of violence are more likely to adopt\nviolent behaviors [27].\nMost of the violence prevention and mitigation strat-\negies identified by Forum participants are consistent\nwith the evidence-based strategies recently endorsed by\nthe WHO (2014) for the violence prevention and re-\nsponse efforts. These include: (1) developing safe, stable\nand nurturing relationships between children and their\nparents and caregivers [42]; (2) developing life skills and\nrelationship skills in children and adolescents; for ex-\nample, programs designed to help children and adoles-\ncents manage anger, resolve conflicts in a non-violent\nway and develop social problem-solving skills [43];\nand comprehensive intimate partner violence (IPV)\nprevention interventions to reduce IPV perpetration\nand victimization among adolescents [12]; (3) pro-\nmoting gender equality to prevent and reduce VAW\n[44]; (4) changing cultural and social norms that\nnormalize and support violence [41]; and (5) victim\nidentification, care and support programs [45].\nOne unique and important idea about violence preven-\ntion and mitigation proposed by the Forum participants\nwas the engagement of intersectoral stakeholders that go\nbeyond the conventional legal, health and social service\nsectors. Existing literature on intersectoral services for\nvictims of violence tend to report on the effectiveness of\nthe provision of legal, housing, financial and safety ad-\nvice; and facilitation of access to and the use of commu-\nnity resources such as shelters, emergency housing, and\npsychological interventions [30]. Addressing the needs\nof victims with trauma-focused care, cognitive behav-\nioral therapy or other low-intensity psychological inter-\nventions and mental health services can potentially\nmitigate the serious mental health outcomes of violence\n[15, 29]. However, our Forum participants emphasized\nthe importance of engaging stakeholders and leaders be-\nyond the conventional sectors to include stakeholders\nand leaders from faith-based, arts, sports and media sec-\ntors to transform dominant social norms and support\nboys and men to engage in positive and healthy outlets\nof stress and emotions. Their suggestion is critical in that\nit promotes critical dialogue about violence prevention in\nthe social space of boys’ and men’s everyday life. The in-\nvolvement of respected community leaders is considered\nto be very effective in changing social norms [13, 36].\nMany international bodies, such as the WHO, Inter-\nnational Confederation of Midwives, Pan-American Health\nOrganization as well as provincial health agencies in\nCanada are increasingly looking at the role of healthcare\nproviders in the provision of quality care defined in multi-\ndimensional terms such as respect, equity, access, patient\ncentredness and effectivness. Quality also denotes care\nunderpinned by respect for the human rights of women,\nHyman et al. Global Health Research and Policy  (2016) 1:6 Page 7 of 9children and marginalized groups (e.g., right to informed\nconsent, right to refuse treatment, right to equal treat-\nment, right to access healthcare, right to health, right to\nprivacy, right to live) [18, 32]. In the context of violence\nprevention and mitigation, quality care denotes care pro-\nviders’ competence in screening their clients for actual and\npotential experience of violence, and provision of care that\nmaximize their clients’ safety and wellbeing and minimize\nthe risk and impact of trauma associated with violence.\nQuality care also includes contributions to violence pre-\nvention through research, advocacy, policy and practice.\nFinally, the research gaps identified by the participants\nare consistent with the current landscape of research on\nviolence, which reflects an imbalance of research that fo-\ncuses more on violence at the individual and interpersonal\nlevel (e.g., personal history of violence, interpersonal vio-\nlence with peers, intimate partners or family members)\nand less on violence at the community level, whereby rela-\ntionships are embedded in social spaces such as schools,\nworkplaces, and neighborhoods, or structural violence at\nthe societal level in the forms of social norms, institu-\ntional practices and public polices [25]. In 1999, the\nWHO Violence Prevention Alliance adopted an eco-\nlogical framework developed by Heise [22] to illustrate\nhow the complex interplay of individual, relationship,\nsocial, cultural and environmental factors are associated\nwith intimate partner violence [25]. Research that pro-\nmotes a better understanding of how socio-ecological\nfactors interact to perpetuate or reduce violence is a\nkey step to developing effective public health ap-\nproaches to address violence.\nLimitations\nWhile the organizing committee aimed to be inclusive in\ninviting individuals from diverse sectors, the Forum par-\nticipants are not representative of all stakeholder groups.\nFor example, there were fewer practitioners from law\nenforcement, education, and legal services, and fewer\ncommunity members or public participants. Given the\nimportance of community participation in, and com-\nmunity as the setting for violence prevention, the inclu-\nsion of the views of the public would have been\ninformative and important. We relied on taking detailed\nnotes to capture participants’ ideas and perspectives\nsince audio-recording of these dialogues was not feas-\nible in the context of a forum with many concurrent\ndiscussion taking place in the same room.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nThe proceedings from the Global Health and Health\nEquity Forum underscore the importance of recognizing\nviolence as a public health issue that requires immediate\nand meaningful communal and structural investment to\nbreak its historic cycles. In order to do so, it is importantto bring together community members, grassroots organi-\nzations, researchers, policy-makers, educators, students\nand cross-sector stakeholders to advance discussions\nabout effective policy and programming for different\nforms of violence. Given the nature of structural and\ninterpersonal violence, any significant and lasting change\nwill require intersectoral efforts. This Forum is just one\nexample of the continued efforts needed to solidify vio-\nlence prevention policies, services, and practices. How-\never, we recognize that effective and sustainable solutions\nmust surpass forums of discussion to actualize policies\nand regulations that can effectively transform oppressive\nsocial structures, address the gaps in violence prevention\nand mitigation, and reinstate societal responsibility for\nviolence prevention.\nBased on our thematic analysis of the information\nfrom the forum, the members of the Centre for Global\nHealth and Equity at Ryerson offers the following\nrecommendations:\n1. Support and adopt policies to prevent and reduce\nstructural violence.\nReducing social disparities through social policy\nreform is essential for both violence prevention and\nreduction. Social policy reforms must address the\nroot cause of violence, that is, inequitable\ndistribution of power and resources resulting in\ndifferential access to social and economic\nopportunities between the dominant groups and the\nmarginalized groups. While these broad\nconsiderations must be central to social policies in\ngeneral, understanding the specific needs of\nmarginalized groups negatively impacted by racism,\nsexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia, poverty\nand other oppressions is a priority. In recognition of\nviolence as a structural issue, finding solutions\nrequires a political and intersectoral approach (i.e.,\ninvolving health, employment, social service,\neducational, housing and criminal justice sectors).\nFor example, strategies to reduce youth related\nviolence should include increasing employment and\neducational opportunities for youth and providing\nfinancial and social supports for parents to help\nreduce the risks that are associated with violence\nand inequitable outcomes. Similar actions are\nneeded to inform and ensure that institutions (e.g.,\nhospitals, police, group homes, and the child welfare\nsystem) review and revise their organizational\npolicies and procedures to address structural\nviolence that creates barriers to providing inclusive\nand respectful services to marginalized individuals\nand communities.\n2. Adopt multi-pronged strategies to change dominant\nsocial norms associated with violence.\nHyman et al. Global Health Research and Policy  (2016) 1:6 Page 8 of 9Since a multiplicity of external and internal\npressures function to maintain dominant cultural\nand social norms, multi-pronged approaches that\nengage diverse stakeholders to influence community\nopinions, inform mass media messages and\ntransform public policy or legislation must be used\nto address violence. Mass media campaigns can be\nused to convey messages about empowering\nrelationships and social interactions to broad\npopulations via television, radio, the Internet,\nnewspapers, magazines and other social mediums.\nLegislation is an important strategy in changing\ncultural perceptions and social norms when violent\nbehaviors are redefined as a criminal offence and the\noffenders have to face legal consequences. Political\nwill and social accountability are also critical because\nthe presence of legislation without the necessary\ninfrastructure of public education, access to legal\nservices, and person-centred services for victims of\nviolence does not guarantee that the legislation will\nbe carried out effectively.\n3. Establish standards and ensure adequate funding for\nviolence prevention program and services.\nComprehensive research evidence is needed to\nestablish promising practices and reorient services to\nmeet the individual and collective needs of affected\ngroups and communities to reduce violence and its\nrelated impact. Community-based services must be\nstrengthened through sustained government funding\nto promote community empowerment in the\ncontinuum of violence prevention and reduction\nprograms. Adequate funding for coordinated and\nsustainable capacity building programming at the\ncommunity level is critical to the establishment of\neffective responses to interpersonal and community\nviolence and to reduce the loss of community\ncapacity to address violence due to resource\ncompetition among stakeholder groups.\n4. Fund higher-level ecological research on violence\nprevention.\nThe current research agenda, with its focus on\nviolence at the personal or interpersonal level does\nnot provide the necessary knowledge and evidence\nto inform policy development and change. Adequate\nresources are needed to support research that\ninvestigate the outcomes of upstream policies on\nviolent prevention, the impact of intersectoral\ninterventions to transform dominant social norms,\nand the effectiveness of population-specific\ninterventions on primary violence prevention.Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the significant contribution of all\nworkshop participants, volunteers and presenters to the Forum.Funding\nFunding for the Forum was provided by Ryerson University.\nPresentation and roundtable notes can be made available for review.\nAuthors’ contributions\nAll authors: Made substantial contributions to conception and design, or\nacquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data; Were involved in\ndrafting the manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual\ncontent; Gave final approval of the version to be published.
