Transgender individuals, or individuals whose gender identity is incongruent with their sex assigned at birth, are one minority group who may experience gender identity related microaggressions. The current review aimed to explore the nature of microaggressions toward transgender individuals, and appraise any relationship between microaggressions and well-being within this population. A systematic search of ASSIA, CINHAL, COCHRANE, EMBASE, PBSC, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO was conducted in June 2020. Grey literature was identified through contacting key researchers and through online database searching of unpublished dissertations/theses. Reference lists of included papers were examined and forward citation completed for key papers. 17 papers were quality assessed and included in the narrative synthesis, encompassing a total of 3432 participants. The findings suggest that transgender individuals experience a range of microaggressive acts, across multiple contexts. A number of additional variables were noted as important when understanding microaggressions within this population; including the individual’s gender identity, the perpetrator, the mode of delivery, and frequency. Emerging evidence tentatively suggests a relationship between gender identity related microaggressions and well-being indicators within this population. In particular, negative cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses were noted. Some studies suggested a relationship between microaggressions and negative mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depressive symptoms and suicidality. However, these conclusions should be interpreted with caution, given a number of methodological and conceptual gaps within the literature. Nonetheless, subtle forms of prejudice are an important area for research and clinical consideration within this population.   6  Introduction Transgender individuals are those whose gender identity is incongruent with their sex assigned at birth (Vincent, 2018). A spectrum of experiences are generally encompassed by this term including (but not limited to); trans man, trans woman, non-binary, gender fluid, gender non-conforming and genderqueer (Vincent, 2018). Cisgender refers to individuals whose gender identity is congruent with their sex assigned at birth (see Appendix 1.2 for full definitions). Despite growing recognition and moves to de-pathologise trans experiences, cisgenderism and transphobia remain widespread worldwide (Coleman et al., 2011; Bachmann & Gooch, 2018).   Prejudice and Discrimination The high prevalence of prejudice, discrimination and victimisation towards transgender and gender non-conforming people is well documented (Bachmann & Gooch, 2018; McCann, 2017). Within Britain, a recent report on LGBT lives concluded that 41% of trans people and 31% of non-binary people report past-year experience of at least one hate crime or incident on the basis of their gender identity or expression alone (Bachmann & Gooch, 2018). The Minority Stress Model (Meyer, 2003) has been adapted and applied to capture the stigma-related experiences within the transgender population (Hendricks & Testa, 2012). This framework posits that minority groups (e.g. trans individuals) experience chronic stress resulting from hostile social situations, which has a negative impact on well-being. More specifically, distal (or ‘external’) stressors (e.g. discrimination, prejudice, victimisation, hate crimes) are highlighted as predisposing minorities to further proximal (or ‘internal’) stressors (e.g. rumination, expectation of future discrimination/victimisation, hypervigilance, internalised transphobia, concealment) (Meyer, 2003; Hendricks & Testa, 2012).  7   Transgender individuals are at disproportionate risk of adverse mental health outcomes compared to cisgender individuals including; depression (Borgogna, McDermott, Aita & Kridel, 2019), anxiety (Borgogna, et al., 2019), self-harm (Marshall et al., 2016), suicidality (Marshall et al., 2016; Wolford-Clevenger, Cannon, Flores, Smith & Stuart, 2017), and substance misuse (Glynn & Berg, 2017). The relationship between minority stressors and psychological distress within the trans population has been extensively noted (McCann & Brown, 2017; Clements-Nolle, Marx, & Katz, 2006). Minority stressors such as prejudice, discrimination and perceived lack of social support have also been noted as correlates of both non-suicidal self-injury and suicidality within the trans population (Wolford-Clevenger, Frantell, Smith, Flores & Stuart, 2018). One growing field of research examining how distinct forms of prejudice and discrimination are experienced by minority groups, and their impact on overall well-being, is that which explores microaggressive acts (or microaggressions).  Understanding Microaggressions Sometimes referred to as ‘everyday discriminations’; microaggressions are described as subtle verbal, behavioural or environmental communications which express bias, prejudice or discrimination toward marginalised groups (Sue et al., 2007; Sue 2010).  Microaggressions can be either intentional or unintentional, although they are often conceptualised as being distinct from overt forms of discrimination in that the perpetrator is often unaware of the underlying hostile expression or potential for harm (Sue, 2010). Microaggressions are also often subjective, subtle and ambiguous in nature and thus can be challenging to identify (Friedlaender, 2018). Research is yet to explore how microaggressions develop. However, 8  these acts are generally understood in three categories; microinsults, microinvalidations and microassaults (Sue, 2010).   Microinsults (e.g. “that’s so gay!”) are communications that convey a negative stereotype toward a specific group, whilst microinvalidations (e.g. “all lives matter!”) are described as communications which nullify or dismiss the lived experience of a marginalised group. Microassaults (e.g. displaying a Nazi symbol) are often conscious and explicit communications of a negative attitude or bias toward a marginalised group, and of the three are described as most similar to blatant, overt forms of prejudice and discrimination (Sue, 2010).   Microaggressions and Psychological Well-being Microaggressions may have a different impact on the well-being of minority groups compared to other forms of discrimination. Perceived discriminations are considered to be more harmful to psychological well-being if they are conceptualised as being pervasive and systemic in nature, as opposed to infrequent or isolated events (Schmitt, Branscombe, Postmes & Garcia, 2014), due to their impact on an individual’s felt sense of control and experience of rejection and social exclusion (Schmitt, et al., 2014; Wirth & Williams, 2009). Microaggressions are one form of perceived discrimination that may be particularly pervasive in nature due to difficulties in both identifying and effectively challenging them (Sue et al., 2007). For example, as microaggressions reinforce social hierarchies, Williams (2020) argues that identified microaggressions often go unchallenged due to the power imbalance between parties. Furthermore, given that microaggressions are predominantly described as 9  unintentional, this can lead to difficulties in challenging these acts as perpetrators may struggle to engage in meaningful discourse that explores their implicit bias (Nadal et al., 2011; DiAngelo, 2011; Friedlaender, 2018; Williams, 2020). DiAngelo (2011) argues that individuals who challenge racial microaggressions are often met with hostility, defensiveness, and further microaggressions.   The majority of literature exploring microaggressions and their consequences has focused on racial and ethnical microaggressions, and concluded that microaggressions represent a health and mental health risk to racial and ethnic minorities. Racial microaggressions have been found to be significantly correlated with both depressive symptoms and higher negative affect (Nadal, Griffin, Wong, Hamit, Rasmus, 2014), lower self-esteem (Nadal, Wong, Griffin, Davidoff, & Sriken, 2014), and poor psychological well-being (Solorzano, Ceja & Yosso, 2000). Blume, Lovato, Thyken and Denny (2012) highlighted the relationship between microaggressions and both binge drinking and anxiety symptoms among racial and ethnic minority students within predominantly white Colleges.   More recently, a growing body of research has explored microaggressions toward other marginalised groups including; people with disabilities (Keller & Galgay, 2010; Conover, Israel & Nylund-Gibson, 2017), people with ill mental health (Gonzales, Davidoff, Nadal, Yanos, 2015), women (Nadal, Hamit, Lyons, Weinberg & Corman, 2013), marginalised  religious groups (Nadal, Griffin, Hamit, Leon, Tobio, Rivera, 2012), people who have been adopted (Garber & Grotevant, 2015), and LGBTQ individuals (Nadal, Whitman, Davis, Erazo & Davidoff, 2016).   10  Nadal et al., (2016) completed a literature review aimed at providing an overview of existing knowledge of microaggressions towards LGBTQ individuals, and highlighted a wide range of microaggressive acts experienced by this minority group. The authors also noted evidence that transgender individuals experience gender identity related microaggressions, however highlighted that their experiences were often incorporated alongside those of LGBQ individuals within existing literature. Gender identity microaggressions refer to those which express subtle prejudice or discrimination toward transgender individuals due to their gender identity being incongruent with their sex assigned at birth. It is recognised that some transgender individuals may also experience sexual orientation microaggressions, however amalgamating gender identity and sexual orientation minority groups (i.e. LGBTQ) may also limit our ability to draw accurate conclusions regarding trans-specific gender identity related microaggressions.   Review objectives The current review is the first, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, to systematically identify and evaluate the current empirical literature existing around gender identity related microaggressions, well-being, and the transgender population. The review’s main aims are to; i) explore the nature of gender identity related microaggressive acts toward transgender people, and ii) explore and determine the evidence of the relationship between these microaggressions and well-being within the transgender population.     11  Method The review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The proposed procedures were preregistered with PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42019160392)(Appendix 1.3).  Search Strategy Scoping searches were completed to determine the feasibility of the research questions. No previous systematic reviews were identified, however key papers that provided an overview of the literature were noted (Nadal et al., 2016; Chang & Chung, 2015). Databases included for electronic searching were chosen based on relevance for the research aims and included: ASSIA, CINHAL, COCHRANE, EMBASE, Psychology & Behavioural Sciences, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO. The final systematic searches were conducted on 19/06/2020.  Searches were limited to papers published in English.   The search strategy was guided by previous reviews which have examined experiences of transgender individuals and/or microaggressions (Wolford-Clevenger, et al., 2018; Lui & Quezada, 2019). Key literature was also searched for alternative key terms (Nadal et al., 2016; Chang & Chung 2015). A subject librarian was consulted on the development of the search strategy. Keywords and indexing terms (MeSH and thesaurus terms) using various combinations included: transgender*, transexual*, female-to-male, male-to-female, androgyn*, TGNC, transmasculine, transman, transmen, transwom*, transfeminine, gender non-conform*, gender minority, gender variant, genderqueer, gender diverse, bigender*, agender*, two-spirit*, genderfluid, gender neutral, non-binary, LGBT*, microaggressi*, microinsult*, microassault*, microinvalidat*, subtle discriminat*, covert discriminat*, 12  implicit bias, implicit prejudice, subtle prejudice, covert prejudice. See Appendix 1.4–1.10 for full search results.    To improve the sensitivity of the search strategy, forward citation searches of key articles in the area (Nadal et al., 2016; Chang & Chung, 2015) were also examined using Scopus and the reference lists of included studies were hand searched for relevant papers. Grey literature was included to increase the data pool and reduce publication bias. Grey literature was identified through; i) contacting key researchers in the area (via ResearchGate), ii) online database searching of unpublished dissertations/theses (The British Library grey literature for Medical Sciences, ProQuest), and iii) through general search engines (e.g. Google). In instances where a piece of grey literature and a later published piece were both identified, the peer-reviewed article only was included.  Eligibility Criteria Studies were included if: i) participants were transgender (defined as people whose gender identity differs from the gender assumed at birth, on the basis of the sex they were assigned), ii) microaggressions (subtle verbal, behavioural or environmental communications which express prejudice or discrimination toward marginalised groups) were the phenomena of interest, iii) the outcome of interest was how microaggressions are experienced by trans people and/or relationship with any well-being indicators, and iv) the study was of qualitative, quantitative or mixed-method design. Studies were excluded if: i) the full-text was not available in English and ii) if trans-specific experiences were not described separately from the overarching LGBT group.     13  Data Selection The search yielded 1650 results, of which 441 were duplicates (figure 1). The author screened the titles and abstracts against the inclusion/exclusion criteria, of which 1163 were not relevant to this review. The full-text of 46 studies were reviewed and of these 29 were excluded because they: i) did not focus specifically on microaggressions or looked at prejudice in general (10 studies), ii) did not describe trans-specific experiences separately from LGBT group (10 studies), iii) did not include a transgender sample (2 studies), iv) the full text was not available (2 studies), v) were a review/article (4 studies), or was an earlier version (grey literature) of an included peer-reviewed article (1 study). A total of 17 studies were identified for inclusion.        14  Figure 1 – PRISMA Flow Diagram                  15  Data Extraction A data extraction tool (Appendix 1.11) was developed, based on the tool used by Zortea, Gray, & O’Connor (2019), to standardise the process of identifying relevant information from each article.  Quality Assessment The quality of selected studies was systematically assessed using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool (CCAT) (Crowe, 2013) (Appendix 1.12), which allows for appraisal across multiple research designs and has established construct validity (Crowe & Sheppard, 2011). The tool consists of eight categories on reporting and methodological issues including; preliminaries, introduction, design, sampling, data collection, ethical matters, results and discussion. A total score for each category is obtained (6-point scale; 0-5), and a further total score (%) is obtained for each paper. Prior to appraisal, it was determined that for the purpose of quality rating a total score of 0-50% would be considered poor, 51-75% moderate, and 76-100% good. A second researcher independently rated a number of papers (23.5% or n=4) to reduce risk of bias. Inter-rater reliability for the categories was moderate (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.5)(McHugh, 2012); all category scores (0-5) were within 1 point. There was no disagreement between any study quality overall (poor/moderate/good). Discussion took place until agreement on ratings was reached.   Data Synthesis Group-level data were synthesized using an integrative narrative synthesis. This approach was chosen due to the inclusion of diverse study designs/aims and the resulting heterogeneity of data. In line with recommended guidance (Popay et al., 2006), a number of 16  key principles were adhered to and included: i) a synthesis of included studies, to give a narrative overview of what research exists on microaggressions toward trans people, ii) an exploration of the relationship within and between studies, looking at how microaggressions are experienced by trans people and the nature of the relationship with general well-being and microaggressions within this population, and iii) a critical reflection and assessment of the robustness of the review. For ease of expression, studies are first numbered within the results (see Table 1) and referred to as such throughout the synthesis. Individual authors/author teams are then used within the discussion.  Results The results of this systematic narrative review represent the key insights and findings from the current literature existing around microaggressions toward transgender populations, as detailed in Table 1.   Quality Appraisal of Studies The levels of quality were critiqued using the CCAT, with only 17.6% (n=3) of studies rated as ‘good’ (see Table 2). As per CCAT guidance, the ratings for each of the 8 categories for each paper are reported (see Appendix 1.13). Only one of the 17 studies was rated as having a high quality design (study 5), while the majority had a moderate design (n=13). Almost half of the studies (n=8) were rated as poor in relation to ethical matters. Reported effect sizes, where applicable, are noted in Appendix 1.15.   17   Study Characteristics Seventeen articles were eligible for inclusion; eight qualitative (studies 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, and 15), four quantitative (studies 3, 9, 12, and 16), and five mix-method studies (studies 1, 4, 5, 11, 17). All studies were of cross-sectional design. Only one of the studies used a control group (matched, randomised) to compare outcomes in presence/no presence of microaggressions (study 1). Fifteen articles were published in peer-reviewed journals (studies 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17) and two were unpublished grey literature (studies 1 and 5). All included studies were completed in the past decade, with over half (n=9) being completed within the past two years. All studies originated from the USA (n=14) or both the USA and Canada (n=3). Across the studies, microaggressions were loosely defined as subtle, verbal, behavioural or environmental indignities that communicate hostility or discrimination toward trans individuals, in line with Sue (2010) definition of racial microaggressions. Study 7 provided a taxonomy of transgender microaggressions which many of the studies used as frameworks for their interview schedule/survey or to interpret their findings (see Appendix 1.14 for full details of taxonomy).   Sample Characteristics  Two of the mixed-method articles retained the same sample across each study component (studies 1 and 4). Two mixed-method articles from one author team included the same study as their qualitative component (studies 11 and 12) and so these qualitative results and sample are only discussed once. Two articles (studies 7 and 8) used the same sample (n=9) however were included and discussed separately as they focused on different aspects of the findings. Therefore the number of samples across 17 papers was 19 (n=3432 participants). 18  The mean age was 25.6 years (based on 11/19 samples reporting mean age) and sample age range was 14-82 years (based on 13/19 samples reporting). Samples differed in the gender identities included; eleven included a range of transgender identities that encompassed both binary and non-binary identities (57.9%), three included only binary gender identities (15.8%), one study focused specifically on non-binary and gender non-conforming (5.3%) identities, while one reported only that individuals were transgender (5.3%), three samples included transgender individuals and cisgender/other gender individuals although outcomes were described separately (15.8%).   19  Table 1.

Findings relating to a relationship between microaggressions and well-being within the trans population are then explored.  Content of Microaggressions A total of 10 studies specifically aimed to explore and describe the content of gender identity microaggressions experienced by transgender individuals (studies 2, 7, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 17). Three of these 10 studies highlighted that microaggressions experienced may differ in terms of content between different trans identities (studies 7, 13, and 14).   Interpersonal microaggressions included; use of transphobic language (study 7), misgendering or misuse of pronouns (studies 2, 6, 7, 10, and 13), assumption of universal transgender experience (study 7), exoticization/tokenisation (studies 6, 7, 10, and 13), discomfort/disapproval of transgender experience (studies 2, 7, and 15), endorsement of gendernormative and binary expectations/behaviours (studies 2, 7, 14, and 15), denial of existence of transphobia (study 7), assumption of psychopathology or sexual abnormality (studies 7 and 11), physical threat/harassment (study 7), denial of individual transphobia (study 7), denial of bodily privacy (studies 7 and 11), transgender identity-denying or non-affirming communications (i.e. those that question, minimise or dismiss the authenticity of transgender individuals identities) (studies 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15), involuntary gender disclosure/violation of privacy or public questioning of identity (studies 2, 11, and 13),  25  passive rejection within social contexts based on gender identity or presentation (inc. within relationships were gender identity was accepted in private contexts) (studies 2, 13, 14, and 15), failing to correct transphobia (study 14), and overemphasis on gender identity (study 6).   Systemic and environmental microaggressions found included;  non-inclusive binary forms (studies 2 and 17), difficulty accessing of safe and inclusive bathrooms (studies 2, 7, and 17), absence of protocols that allow for the use of gender-inclusive language (study 2), lack of competence/knowledge regarding transgender issues within systems (studies 2 and 6), absence of gender-inclusive housing on campuses (study 17), gatekeeping to health services (study 6), non-affirming policies and practices within systems (i.e. workplaces, healthcare, criminal justice, barriers to changing legal documents) (studies 7 and 10).  One quantitative study (study 9) used qualitative data from a previous study (study 7), to compile and initial pilot a quantitative measure of transgender microaggressions; the Gender Identity Microaggressions Scale-Initial (GIMS-Initial). The validity across five subscales (denial of gender identity, misuse of pronouns, invasion of bodily privacy, behavioural discomfort and denial of societal transphobia) was strong (Cronbach’s alpha =.76), however methodological limitations applied.  Context in which Microaggressions Occur Microaggressions are experienced across various interpersonal and environmental contexts. Nine studies in this review investigated microaggressive experiences in general everyday situations (studies 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 16). A total of four studies found  26  microaggressions are experienced within close interpersonal relationships; including within close friendships (studies 4 and 13) and within romantic relationships (studies 14 and 15). One study found that transgender individuals experience microaggressions within therapeutic relationships (study 6). Three studies found microaggressions occur within education and academic settings (studies 2, 10, and 17), however the scope and aims of these studies varied. Two of these studies described student’s experiences; one found that interpersonal and environmental microaggressions were experienced in Social Work programmes (study 2) and one found evidence of environmental microaggressions within Colleges in general (study 17). The third study found that microaggressions are experienced by trans academics in their workplaces (study 10).    Frequency and Intensity of Microaggressions Microaggressions experienced by trans individuals in general are diverse in both content and context. Similarly, a number of studies also discussed variations in the frequency of trans-specific microaggressions (studies 1, 4, and 12). Two studies investigated factors associated with the frequency by which a transgender individual may experience microaggressions (study 4 and 12). Lower income and lower level of self-reported degree of ‘passing’ were associated with increased frequency of experienced nonaffirming microaggressions (on average, per week), whilst older age was associated with lower frequency (study 12). Adolescents (aged 14-16) may experience the highest frequency of microaggressions, whilst race/ethnicity was not associated with frequency (study 12). Interpersonal microaggressions are experienced more frequently by trans people within their friendships with cisgender and heterosexual people, followed by cisgender LGBTQ friendships, and lastly (and least frequently) within friendships with other trans individuals  27  (study 4). Notably, over a third (36%) of a control group of trans individuals who were asked to recall the Wednesday of the previous week (as opposed to experimental group who were asked to recall a microaggression) also described experiencing at least one microaggressive act (study 1).  Five included studies suggested that the intensity of emotional responses to microaggressions may differ based on the perpetrator (studies 4, 13, 14, and 15) and method of delivery (study 11). Interpersonal microaggressions are described as more hurtful when the aggressor was considered a close friend (studies 4 and 13) or a romantic partner (studies 14 and 15). Moreover, self-reported intensity of negative affect is higher in response to interpersonal microaggressions when the friend/aggressor is considered to have a similar gender identity/sexual identity to the victim (study 4). Two studies found that media based non-affirming microaggressions (both traditional and social media) evoke higher emotional responses than interpersonal events (study 5 and 11). Types of microaggressions (microinvalidations and microinsults vs microassaults), although notably hard to categorise, may vary in their impact on feelings of social exclusion (study 1).   Relationship between Microaggressions and Well-being A number of studies aimed to qualitatively explore and described consequences of experiencing microaggressions. Five studies noted various emotional responses including; betrayal (studies 4 and 8), distress (studies 8 and 17), hopelessness and exhaustion (studies 5, 8 and 11), rejection (study 4), feeling invalidated and misunderstood (studies 4, 8, and 17), disappointment (study 4), feeling uncomfortable (studies 4 and 17), feeling worn  28  down/apathetic (study 11), empathy for other trans individuals (study 5). Four studies noted behavioural responses including; direct confrontation (study 8), indirect confrontation (studies 8 and 10), passive coping (studies 4, 8 and 11) and adaptive/creative responses (e.g.  activism) (study 17). One study noted cognitive responses including; rationalisation, double bind/‘balancing act’ and, vigilance and self-preservation (study 8). Two studies discussed changes to interpersonal functioning including; withdrawal from social interaction (study 11), and distance within or ending of interpersonal relationships (study 4). Although not specifically investigated, a further five qualitative studies touched on negative emotional (studies 2, 6, 13, 14, and 15), behavioural (study 6), and cognitive (study 15) responses to experiencing microaggressive acts within their participants accounts. Similarly, the ending of interpersonal relationships in response was also noted (studies 13 and 14)  A further 6 studies included quantitative measures of the impact of microaggressive acts on the well-being of trans individuals including; self-esteem (study 16), stress (study 16), anxiety (study 16), depressive symptoms (studies 5, 11 and 17); suicidality (studies 3, 5, 11 and 17) and academic functioning (study 17). Higher levels of microaggressions experienced were associated with lower self-esteem, greater perceived stress and greater anxiety symptoms (study 16). Microaggressions also contributed to feelings of social exclusion (e.g. lower relational value, lower satisfaction of basic needs being met, and higher rating of ostracism)(Study 1). Environmental microaggressions specifically were associated with poorer academic development and lower perceptions of social inclusion, but are not independently associated with depressive symptoms (study 17). Two related mixed-method studies conceptualised transgender identity-related stress (or trans-identity defence related emotions (TIDE)) (studies 5 and 11). Study 5 describes how trans individuals may need to defend the validity of their identity within the context of societal non-acceptance/experiences  29  of non-affirming microaggressions, which results in subsequent negative affect and emotional compromise.  Increased weekly frequency of non-affirming transgender microaggressions (interpersonal and media based) are associated with increased odds of past year depressive symptoms, past year suicidal ideation, and life-time suicidality (ideation and attempts) (study 11). In particular, increased frequency of microaggressions which result in weariness or apathy are associated with greater odds of past-year depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (study 11). Trans individuals with higher transgender identity defence-related emotions (TIDE) scores, as a consequence of experiencing non-affirming microaggressions, have higher rates of societal disengagement, emotional withdrawal and engagement in suicide-related behaviours (study 5). Interpersonal microaggressions uniquely contribute to lifetime suicide attempts for trans youth (when compared to other psychosocial risk factors), but are not significantly associated with past 6-month suicidal ideation (study 3). Environmental microaggressions are not associated with suicide attempt (studies 3 and 17), or past 6-month suicidal ideation (study 17).  Discussion The current review aimed firstly to explore the nature of microaggressive acts toward transgender people. Unsurprisingly, included studies suggest that transgender individuals do experience gender identity related microaggressions across a number of contexts. A second aim was to explore and determine the evidence of the relationship between microaggressions and well-being within the transgender population. Emerging evidence tentatively suggests a  30  relationship between microaggressions and well-being, with experiencing microaggressive acts as potentially having a negative impact on the well-being of transgender individuals. However, these conclusions should be interpreted with caution, given a number of limitations within the existing literature base.  Nadal et al. (2012) were the first to extend previous literature examining microaggressions toward LGBTQ people to explore trans-specific experiences. Prior to this, our knowledge of transgender individuals’ experiences of microaggressions were amalgamated with sexual minority cisgender people’s experiences (Nadal, Rivera, Corpus & Sue, 2010) and thus our ability to draw accurate conclusions of trans-specific experiences was significantly limited. For transgender individuals, these subtle, everyday communications of discrimination are diverse in content and can be experienced across multiple contexts including within friendships, intimate relationships, therapeutic relationships, workplaces and academic settings. Despite the current findings, our ability to accurately draw conclusions regarding the nature of gender identity related microaggressions remains limited for a number of reasons, including methodological limitations within existing studies and conceptual gaps within microaggression theory more generally.  Transgender individuals’ experiences are not homogenous; they are informed by a number of different factors, such as gender identity, stage of transition, degree of ‘passing’ (i.e. degree to which they are perceived by others as the gender they identify with) and assigned sex (Chang & Chung, 2015; Levitt and Ippolito, 2014). Chang and Chung (2015) previously cautioned that the complexity of transgender identities may influence how microaggressive acts are experienced by trans individuals. In line with these concerns, the results suggest  31  qualitative differences in microaggressions experienced by non-binary and gender non-conforming identities when compared to binary identities. Similarly, differences were also highlighted across binary identities (transman/transwoman), and self-reported level of ‘passing’ was associated with a decreased frequency of microaggressions. Therefore, despite several included studies seeking to identify and describe microaggressions experienced by the transgender population, our current knowledge of gender identity microaggressions may lack depth due to samples often including a diverse range of transgender identities. Similar concerns have been raised in existing racial microaggression literature, which often does not account for differences in racial groups or variations in visibility of minority status (Derthick, David, Saw and Okazaki, 2014). It is recognised that inclusive transgender research which encompasses the range of gendered experiences is imperative; however future studies should also hold in mind the heterogeneity of transgender identities when considering their sampling.  The vast majority of the research literature adding to our understanding of trans microaggressions comes from qualitative methodologies, which facilitate the gathering of rich insights into individuals’ lived experiences and how they make sense of particular phenomena (Hammarberg, Kirkman, & Lacey, 2016). Nonetheless, these methods are not without limitations, such as relying on participants self-report and researcher’s own interpretations which can both be subject to bias. For example, included studies often first provided participants with definitions of microaggressions before asking for their experiences of such and their emotional reactions, thus automatically confirming the studied phenomenon. Alternatively, researchers interpreted participants’ accounts of general lived experiences in line with a definition of microaggressions held in mind. However, this latter approach then relies further on the researchers’ own assumptions of what those experiences  32  entailed for both the individual and the perpetrator. Microaggressions are complex and subjective in nature: what one individual may appraise as a microaggressive act, others may not, thus they may not experience similar reactions or responses. The subjectivity of microaggressions in general may exacerbate these methodological limitations, inherently making it a challenging area of research (Lilienfeld, 2017).  Lilienfeld (2017) cautioned that due to substantial research exploring racial microaggressions and their impact, that subsequent areas of research within minority populations may assume more construct validity than current literature would suggest. One conceptual gap within microaggressions literature in general is discerning microaggressive acts, particularly microassaults, from overt prejudice (Lilienfeld, 2017; Wong et al., 2014). Certainly, at times included studies described microaggressions which could be conveyed as more overt forms of prejudice and discrimination: Pitcher (2017) for example, described trans academics being fired for their trans status within participants accounts. Similarly, Morris et al., (2020) described overt hostility from clinicians and mental health services being unable to meet trans individuals needs as microaggressions. AuBuchon and colleagues (2019) were unable to reliably code participant’s accounts of transgender microaggressive experiences into the three distinct types of microaggressions: microassaults, microinvalidations and microinsults (Sue, 2010) due theoretical similarities and common co-occurrence. Included studies tended to focus instead on overarching interpersonal and environmental categories of microaggressions.   With regard to well-being, emerging evidence suggest a relationship between microaggressions and negative well-being outcomes within the transgender population. Negative emotional, behavioural, and cognitive responses to microaggressions were noted  33  throughout included studies, in addition to negative mental health outcomes including increased anxiety, depressive symptoms and suicidality. Microaggressions may also disrupt social support and academic learning. These findings are in line with existing research exploring the impact of microaggressions within other minority groups (Parr & Howe, 2019; Nadal et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014). Some adaptive coping strategies in response were also reported, such as becoming involved in activism. A number of variables were also indicated as important to consider when evaluating the impact of microaggressions on well-being, such as aggressor, frequency, method of delivery (e.g. media vs interpersonal), and type of emotional response (e.g. defence-related stress/emotions). However the aforementioned complexities of defining and measuring microaggressions remain, and again limit our ability to draw definitive conclusions.   Additionally, it remains unclear how transgender microaggressions differ from, or may fit within, other models of discrimination or minority stress. Howe (2019) concluded that microaggressions that deny that trans people exist (gender identity non-affirming microaggressions), described as an emotional trauma, should be considered a specific minority stressor within the minority stress model (Meyer, 2003). However further research is required to support these findings. Similarly, the processes which may mediate any relationship between microaggressions and well-being or mental health outcomes remains largely unknown.     34  Methodological Limitations and Recommendations for Future Research The discussion above has pointed to a number of methodological limitations which future research should seek to minimise, including the potential for bias within study designs, the amalgamation of trans identities with samples, and conceptual gaps in how microaggressions are defined and measured. The current review did not identify any validated quantitative measures of microaggressions with the trans population. Nadal et al. (2018) did however pilot a measure (the GIMS), although notably this is based on the findings from a study with a number of methodological limitations (Nadal et al., 2012) and further research is required to fully investigate the reliability and validity of this measure.  All of the studies originated in the USA or Canada and so it unclear how they may generalise worldwide. Similarly, individuals of white ethnicity and those with binary gender identities were over-represented across the studies. Samples were mainly from online LGBT groups, where participants may have had more access to support and resources to understand or cope with microaggressions. There remain important areas yet to be explored, such as microaggressions with family contexts and healthcare settings, or preferred coping mechanisms. Longitudinal studies may help identify the cumulative effects of microaggressions or their impact over time.   Review Limitations The current review is the first to systematically explore and synthesise the existing literature examining microaggressions within the transgender population, and thus a wide scope of studies with varying experimental designs and aims were included. However this  35  then presented a challenge of synthesising and describing diverse results from mixed-methods literature. Therefore our ability to describe the results in detail, beyond a narrative, was limited. Similarly, the inclusion of multiple gender identities across the included papers also limits the generalisability of the results and conclusions discussed within the current review.  Microaggressions are a relatively new concept and so there are potentially a number of studies which the search strategy would not have identified due to the authors not defining the explored experiences as subtle prejudice or microaggressions. For example, studies exploring the impact of individuals not using a trans persons chosen name could perhaps be considered, in line with the concept of microaggressions, as describing the impact of a specific non-affirming interpersonal microaggression. It is recognised that individuals can have multiple minority identities, although the current review did not explore intersectional microaggressions that transgender people may experience.   Clinical Implications  Clinicians should be aware of how they themselves may express microaggressions towards transgender individuals and utilise their own supervision structures to explore and reflect on their own implicit biases. Due to the power differences that maintain microaggressions and the negative impact that challenging these may have on minority individuals, clinicians should aim to explore and correct any microaggressive acts/communications they witness. In general, transgender individuals and their needs shouldn’t be unfamiliar to those providing care; clinical services should be staffed by individuals who have a clear understanding of the lived experiences of transgender individuals and how forms of prejudice, including microaggressions, can impact on their  36  well-being and mental health outcomes. Discussing microaggressive experiences during assessment may help to identify important risk factors, particularly given the suggested relationship between microaggressions and suicidality.   Systemic and environmental microaggressions are likely to be encountered within wider healthcare and education systems. Action should be taken at a systemic level to not only reduce these everyday experiences (e.g. use of trans-affirmative and gender-inclusive language within practice (i.e. people who menstruate), removal of gender-binary forms, access to comfortable bathrooms), but actively promote the rights of transgender individuals (e.g. increased access to gender-affirming healthcare, providing trans-inclusive education and training, transgender voices represented throughout healthcare and within decision making roles, funding further clinical research). Wider policy reform that challenges prejudice and discrimination towards trans individuals will help to maintain momentum towards trans-inclusive systems, particularly in the face of cisgender individuals who continue to use their position of privilege and wide reaching platforms to express and ‘legitimise’ prejudice towards the transgender population.   Conclusions The current review suggests transgender individuals may experience a wide array of microaggressions, across a number of interpersonal and environmental contexts. Emerging evidence of a relationship between microaggressions and negative consequences for well-being was noted. However, these conclusions should be interpreted with caution, due to limitations within included studies and gaps within existing literature. Despite this, it is  37  important to continue to draw attention to and investigate subtle, implicit forms of prejudice within psychological research. The relevance of this research within the trans population is clear. In light of increasing visibility of transgender people within society and subsequent ‘debate’ around transgender individuals’ (human) rights, this research becomes increasingly imperative. Therefore future studies should seek to address the discussed limitations within existing literature, in order to increase scientific rigour and confidence in the validity of findings. In turn, this will lead to increasingly robust policy and clinical practice recommendations aimed at improved outcomes for trans individuals.         38  References  (*Included studies)  * AuBuchon, Stephanie M., \"Exploring Microaggressions Among Trans Populations: Effects on Feelings of Social Exclusion\" (2019).

Transgender individuals are at a much higher risk of suicidality and self-harm than the general population.  Suicidality refers to thoughts about ending one’s life, plans to do so, and actual attempts. Self-harm refers to self-inflicted damage to one’s body, which is not related to a desire to end one’s own life.  For many, self-harm is a means to help cope with difficult emotions.    Aim: This study aimed to explore transgender peoples’ experiences of self-harm and suicidality, and how they make sense of these experiences. We sought to uncover factors which may contribute to, or decrease, risk of self-harm and suicidality among transgender people. We also hoped to expand our understanding of how transgender people seek help when experiencing suicidal distress.  Method: A small number of transgender adults (n=4), who report a history of self-harm or suicidality, took part in semi-structured one-on-one interviews. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and then analysed.   Results: Various patterns emerged in participants’ accounts of their lives. Participants spoke about early relationships and experiences that increased their self-harm and suicidal distress, and the motives underlying these thoughts and behaviours. Some participants reported that their self-harm and suicidal distress reduced as the strategies that they found helpful to cope, increased. However additional stressors, such as prejudice and discrimination, continued to threaten participants’ psychological well-being and may reduce the likelihood that they will seek help when experiencing suicidal distress.  51  Conclusion: Participants described a range of patterns and experiences across various stages of their lives. These important insights may help inform risk management and clinical interventions.      52  Abstract Purpose: Transgender individuals are substantially more likely to report self-harm and suicidality than both cisgender individuals and other LGBT individuals. The psychosocial factors underlying self-harm and suicidality within the trans population, and how they may lead to suicidal ideation or attempts, remain largely under-researched. Protective factors, such as resilience and help-seeking may help to reduce risk of suicide within the trans population, however further research is required to examine these processes. Similarly, exploring trans-specific experiences of help-seeking for suicidal distress is important when considering suicide prevention. Further empirical research, aimed at improving our understanding and prevention of suicide within this population, is imperative.  Method:  A qualitative design was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with transgender adults (n=4) in Scotland, who reported a history of self-harm and/or suicidality. Interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).  Results: Four superordinate themes emerged, each with inter-related subordinate themes. 1) “Early Experiences”: How individuals made sense of early experiences which increased their self-harm and suicidal distress. 2) “Intent”: The motives underlying participants’ self-harm and suicidality. 3) “Hope and Resilience”: The protective resilience factors that reduced participants’ self-harm and suicidal distress. 4) “Threats to Resilience”: How participants made sense of additional minority stressors that were relevant to their experiences.   53  Conclusion: The current study suggests that transgender individuals may experience psychosocial factors related to self-harm and suicidality differently across various stages of their lives. Important insights into the motivations underlying self-harm and suicidality for transgender individuals emerged. Clinical implications are discussed, however further research is required to fully understand self-harm and suicidality within the transgender community.     54  Introduction Transgender (or ‘trans’) people are individuals whose sense of felt gender (i.e. gender identity) differs from the gender assumed at birth, on the basis of the sex they were assigned (Vincent, 2018). The term cisgender (or ‘cis’) describes individuals whose gender assumed at birth reflects their gender identity (see Appendix 1.2 for full definitions). Research has consistently shown that trans individuals are more at risk of suicide than those from the cisgender population (Adams, Hitomi & Moody, 2017; Clements-Nolle, Marx and Katz, 2006; Haas, Rodgers & Herman, 2014; McNeil, Ellis & Eccles 2017; Peterson, Matthews, Copps-Smith & Conard, 2017). Trans individuals are also more likely to attempt suicide than Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual individuals (Haas et al., 2014; Mustanski & Liu, 2013).   One UK trans mental health survey (McNeil, Bailey, Ellis, Morton & Regan, 2012) noted that the majority of respondents (84%) indicated current or historical suicidal ideation, with 48% of these individuals having attempted suicide at least once. Similarly, Virupaksha, Muralidhar and Ramakrishna (2016) found lifetime rates of suicide attempts within the trans population to be between 32% and 52% globally. These prevalence rates are substantially higher than the cross-national lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation (9.2%) and attempts (2.7%) within the general population (Nock et al., 2008). A higher prevalence of self-harm also exists within the trans population (between 19% and 39%), compared to the cis population (Marshall et al., 2016). A history of self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts are known risk factors of dying by suicide within the general population (Chan et al., 2016). However, the lifetime prevalence of trans individuals dying by suicide is currently unknown (Wolford-Clevenger, Cannon, Flores, Smith & Stuart, 2017), largely due to challenges in recording trans identities at the time of death (McNeil et al., 2017).    55  Although research within the transgender population has increased in recent years, this population remains vastly understudied (Wolford-Clevenger et al., 2017). The high rates of self-harm and suicidality among trans people highlights the importance of continued research within this area, aimed at improving our understanding and prevention of suicide within this population.   Correlates of Self-harm and Suicidality A systematic review by McNeil et al. (2017) summarised the correlates of suicidal ideation and behaviours within the trans population. Environmental factors, specifically those related to minority stressors (e.g. discrimination, victimisation and social stigma), were identified as strongly related to suicidal ideation and attempts. Individual factors, such as co-morbid mental health difficulties and internalised transphobia, were also discussed as risk factors for ideation and attempts. Similar risk factors have been described for self-harm among trans people, including discrimination, perceived lack of social support and interpersonal problems (Marshall et al., 2016). The relationship between self-harm and suicidality within the trans population requires further attention; however research suggests a positive correlation between self-harm and suicide attempt history (Wolford-Clevenger, Frantell, Smith, Flores & Stuart, 2018).   Klonsky & May (2015) proposed the ideation-to-action framework, which provides a theoretical stance for understanding suicidality and suggests that suicidal ideation and attempts have distinct but related pathways. McNeil et al. (2017) did not review correlates of suicidal ideation and attempts separately thus likely limiting our ability to consider clinical implications. Therefore Wolford-Clevenger et al. (2018) systematically reviewed and described separately the correlates of suicidal ideation and attempts within the trans  56  population. Guided by the ideation-to-action framework (Klonsky & May, 2015), the authors described a number of internal and external minority stress experiences (e.g. prejudice/discrimination, victimisation, expectations of rejection, self-stigma) which, in combination, potentially contribute to psychological pain and thus drive suicidal ideation. In parallel with the general suicide literature, a positive correlation was found between suicide attempt history and fearsome and painful events among trans people. These events include both physical and sexual violence, substance misuse and, as discussed, self-harm. However, in contrast with our understanding that key fearful and physically painful events shift ideation toward attempts, internalised minority stressors were also positively correlated with a move from ideation to action for trans people.   Notably, this review highlighted the poor methodological quality of research within this area, cautioning that any conclusions drawn regarding the correlates of suicidality in trans people should be considered tentatively. The authors noted that further research efforts are needed to understand the factors which may contribute to a shift from suicidal ideation toward action among transgender people, particularly when considering the generalisation of existing suicide theoretical frameworks to this population. The review highlighted that future qualitative research may help to illuminate these factors, which may encompass a range of uniquely trans-specific experiences.  Suicide Prevention Understanding psychosocial protective factors, including resilience and help-seeking behaviours is important for suicide prevention. Resilience refers to the process whereby an individual is able to adaptively respond to and cope with adversity (Windle, 2011), and recognition has been given to its role in helping individuals ‘bounce back’ from minority  57  stressors that threaten their psychological well-being (Meyer, 2015). Literature has highlighted enhanced internal and external resilience strategies that transgender people may develop in response to cumulative adversity, including reframing of challenges, defining one’s own gender and collective self-esteem (Grossman, D’Augelli & Frank, 2011; Singh, Meng, & Hansen, 2014; McCann & Brown, 2017). Individual and community resilience factors can reduce risk of suicidality within the trans population (Moody & Smith, 2013; Moody, Fuks, Pelaez & Smith; 2015), although the processes that underlie this reduction remain largely unknown. Edwards, Torre-Barnal, Hanley & Martin (2019) provided some evidence for a process whereby perceived social support first increases an individual’s emotional stability, and thus indirectly leads to increased resilience and lower levels of suicide risk.   To date, minimal research has explored help-seeking for self-harm and suicidality specifically within the adult trans population. The current literature discusses experiences of/fear of stigma and discrimination within a healthcare context, fear of social consequences, and a belief that their needs will not be met, as barriers to transgender people fully utilising professional health services in general (Ellis, Bailey & McNeil, 2015; McNair & Bush, 2016; Shipherd, Greene & Abramovitz, 2010; Poteat, German & Kerrigan, 2013). Some limited research has hypothesised that trans people may be more likely to seek help for suicidal distress only when a crisis point is reached (McDermott, Hughes and Rawlings, 2018; Effrig, Bieschke & Locke, 2011), perhaps due to fear of rejection and exploitation (Hunt, Morrow & McGuire, 2019). The existence of group-specific differences (e.g. based on education level, socioeconomic status, culture, race, gender, age)(Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2014), in addition to the substantial impact of attitudes and stigma on help-seeking (Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2014; Calear, Batterham & Christensen, 2014), suggest that further suicide prevention  58  research is needed to understand the underlying processes of trans-specific help-seeking behaviours.  Lived Experience  Information gained from quantitative research can help to determine a number of risk/protective factors related to self-harm and suicidality. However, a deeper understanding of how and why these factors may lead to, or reduce, individuals’ risk of engaging in harmful behaviours may require a more in-depth examination of accounts of suicidality (Hjelmeland & Loa Knizek, 2010). Qualitative research aimed at exploring the lived experiences of individuals who are directly affected may help to provide rich insights into the context, mechanisms and intent underlying these complex phenomena for individuals, thus helping to inform suicide prevention policy and practice.   Aim The aim of the research was to explore the lived experience of transgender individuals who report a history of self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviours.   Research Questions I. What psychosocial factors are associated with an increased or decreased risk of self-harm and/or suicidality within the trans population? II. What are trans peoples’ experiences of help-seeking in the context of self-harm and/or suicidality?    59  Method Design The study employed a retrospective qualitative design. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted, and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)(Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2009).   Ethical Considerations Approval was gained from the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Research and Development Department (GN19MH431) and the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (19-WS-0169)(Appendix 2.1). The confidential nature of participation, and limits thereof, were made explicit. Written informed consent was provided prior to interview (Appendix 2.2). The potentially sensitive and emotive topic was acknowledged, and participants advised that they did not need to answer any questions they did not wish to. A risk screening tool (Appendix 2.7) was used at the start and end of every interview to ascertain imminent risk of suicide specifically. No participant disclosed information suggesting that they may be at imminent risk of suicide. A risk management plan was in place should this have been required, including a field supervisor on site during interviews. Consideration was given to the participants’ emotional well-being following interview. Participants described partaking as a cathartic experience, with some expressing a sense of gratification from contributing to research that may help toward improved outcomes for trans people. A list of contacts for further support following interview was provided (Appendix 2.8).    60   Recruitment  A purposive sample of adult transgender individuals with experience of self-harm and/or suicidality was sought from the Sandyford Gender Identity Service (GIS) within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. The Sandyford GIS is not considered a mental health service; however it is a clinical service that provides support to any person who feels uncomfortable/uncertain about their gender identity. Potential participants who had provided consent to be contacted for research purposes were identified from an internal waiting list, and sent information pertaining to the study (Appendix 2.3). Participants were identified by GIS administration staff who oversee the waiting lists and who were not involved in the research beyond recruitment. Interested individuals provided consent for the researcher to contact them (Appendix 2.4). The researcher then telephoned to arrange a convenient interview date/time.    Participants and Sample Size IPA embraces smaller sample sizes which allow for a greater, in-depth exploration of participants’ accounts (Reid, Flowers & Larkin, 2005). Therefore, the study sought to recruit between 4 and 10 participants, which is the range of sample size recommended for doctoral research (Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2009). Inclusion criteria indicated that participants should: (i) have a gender identity which is incongruent with sex assigned at birth, (ii) report a history of self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviours, (iii) be aged 17 or over, and (iv) be fluent in English. The exclusion criteria included those with a known forensic history or who were at imminent risk of suicide   61   Seven individuals were recruited between February 2020 and March 2020, however, this yielded a final sample size of four participants who were interviewed. One individual did not attend interview (no reason given) and two interviews were cancelled due to Covid-19 restrictions. Recruitment ceased in line with the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde suspension of research activities in response to Covid-19 (Appendix 2.5). In light of these circumstances, the data already gathered were discussed between researchers and the decision was made to end recruitment and progress to analysis with the reduced sample size.   Data Collection Interviews were conducted by the first author (L.B.) at the Sandyford clinic, lasting between 57 minutes and 1 hour 22 minutes. A schedule was used to help structure these interviews (Appendix 2.6) and support participants to reflect on the events, relationships and experiences central to their self-harm and/or suicidality and help-seeking, in line with IPA’s inductive stance. The schedule was developed in discussion between researchers and field supervisors, and through exploration of the current literature. Interviews were audio-recorded prior to full verbatim transcription.   Interviews began with open questions, encouraging participants to introduce what they deem important to their first-hand experience of self-harm and/or suicidality. An inductive process of reflection and probing questions was used throughout to facilitate a deeper exploration of participant’s accounts (e.g. “what sense do you make of that?”, “what was that like?”). The interviews typically followed a chronological story of participants lived experience  62  preceding, during and proceeding periods of suicidality and/or self-injurious thoughts/behaviours. Accounts of formal and informal help-seeking were intertwined within participant’s own understanding and factors related to self-harm and/or suicidality, as opposed to a separate topic of discussion.   Data Analysis  IPA was chosen as its inductive epistemology is concerned with meaning-making, and allows for an, in-depth analysis of expert accounts. Through this analysis, IPA attempts to interpret and present an account of the ways in which people understand and experience subjective, important phenomena in their lives (e.g. self-harm and suicidality). Therefore the researcher first immersed themselves in the data through repeatedly listening to, and re-reading, the interview transcript. As described by Smith et al. (2009), line-by-line analysis was then completed, providing initial exploratory notes on descriptive, linguistic and conceptual content. Secondly, emergent themes were developed by engaging with the initial coded data and interpreting what it might mean for participants to have these concerns, in this context. This analysis and interpretation was done in line with IPA’s hermeneutic stance; an inductive process whereby the focus is on interpretation of meaning within the individuals account. Sample coding transcripts and emergent themes were reviewed between researchers to ensure coherence and plausibility of themes. An example analysed transcript is included in Appendix 2.9. Each participant’s data were analysed separately, before relationships between emergent themes within the group were considered. Shared higher-order qualities were identified, whilst also accounting for unique idiosyncratic instances. Together, these were further interpreted and developed through an iterative process, whereby recurring key themes were defined. The key themes presented were considered the ‘best fit’ for participants’ narratives and were prevalent within all participants’ accounts.   63   Researcher Reflexivity The researcher considered how their personal and professional experiences may have influenced how they conducted the research and data analysis. The researcher is a trainee clinical psychologist working within local mental health services, including with individuals expressing suicidality. This experience provided the researcher with valuable knowledge of the psychosocial concepts that participants discussed, although in turn required the researcher to suspend attempts to “formulate” participants’ lived experiences, focusing instead on participants’ own meaning-making processes. As a heterosexual cisgender woman, the researcher explicitly acknowledged the implicit biases and assumptions that influenced them to undertake research in the field of suicidality in transgender populations. For example, by paying particular attention to the way in which transgender experiences are often portrayed within the existing literature, and how this led to pre-conceived ideas of a ‘typical’ transgender experience being defined by risk and vulnerabilities. Throughout the process, the researcher embraced an open-mind to participants’ experiences, as opposed to searching for solely challenges in participants’ accounts or interpreting first-hand experiences related the phenomena of interest as being exclusively related to a participant’s transgender status. The researcher kept reflective notes to help facilitate this reflective stance and ‘bracket-off’ beliefs whist engaging in the analysis of data. Given the emotional content on the data, the researcher also considered their own emotional response’s during the process, so as to be able to fully engage with the participants’ narratives.    Results  64  The sample characteristics are first discussed, before presenting the findings from the qualitative interviews. Participant Characteristics Participants were asked to: (i) describe their gender identity, and (ii) identify the sex they were assigned at birth (Table 2). All participants currently lived in urban Scotland and were aged between 19 and 27 (M=22.25, SD=3.59). All participants expressed a previous desire to kill themselves and planning in response, with one participant having made a number of attempts to do so via overdose. All participants had expressed a desire to injure themselves without intent to die, with three participants having done so multiple times by cutting.

Table 3: Superordinate and Subordinate Themes Identified during the Analysis  Superordinate  Subordinate    Early Experiences  “Kicking up a fuss again”: Emotional invalidation   “Everything just keeps pilling up”: Cumulative stressors    “I couldn’t understand why I was feeling like this”: Navigating norms      Intent   “I just wanted someone to notice”: Communicating a need  “It would numb me”: Dealing with dysphoria  “I still had that like survival plan, it was suicide”: Escape from despair   Hope and Resilience    “I was just being happy that I could finally be me”: I can be me   “I existed as a human being”: Social connectedness   Threats to Resilience    “More exposed”: Prejudice and discrimination   “Why is this not an emergency?”: Unmet needs    Early Experiences   66  The first superordinate theme deals with how participants make sense of their journey toward self-harm and/or suicidality. Three interrelated subthemes emerged that may describe risk factors associated with greater risk of self-harm and/or suicidality for trans individuals, and touch on how these risk factors interact with experiences of help-seeking: i) emotional invalidation, ii) cumulative stressors, iii) navigating norms.   Emotional Invalidation Participants understood their experiences of self-harm and suicidality in the context of early environments and interpersonal relationships that invalidated their internal emotional experiences and contributed to suicidal distress. For Luke, there was a sense throughout his life that persistent rejection of his expressions of emotion by others led to him conceptualising his experiences as abnormal or shameful, resulting in further suicidal distress. He goes on to describe withdrawing from a formal mental health intervention and increasing suicidal behaviours as a result: “my mental health issues were always just brushed off as just me looking for attention and me just needlessly being like wanting to make other people suffer … I just got sick of it all of that and I was just like right if she wants me to stop going, I’ll just stop going, and then I think it was like 2 months later was my first suicide attempt”. (Luke)  Similarly, Sebastien described how their family often minimised their distress, “I was the ‘problem child’; the one that always like kicks up a fuss and has a tantrum”, and reflected on reduced seeking of support from caregivers when in distress, as a result. Cameron provided  67  an explicit account of how these invalidating responses interacted with informal help-seeking to create emotional distance: “When we were in a relationship … I would reach out to them for support [and] it was almost, “well it’s not that bad because I’ve went through *this*”… my problems were squashed and that would just make it worse for me.” (Cameron)  Cameron’s use of ‘squashed’ emphasises how his distress was belittled by those in the position to provide informal support, thus increasing his negative affect whilst reducing his capacity to adaptively cope. It is important to note that for participants, these early experiences were perceived as invalidation and rejection of their emotional experiences at that time and not specifically of their gender identity.     Cumulative Stressors An accumulation of early adversity and potentially traumatic experiences were highlighted throughout, leading to an increase in hopelessness and increased capacity for self-harm and suicidality, “everything just keeps pilling up and em- what’s the [point]?” (Luke). Each participant demonstrated a preoccupation with age when conceptualising their life experiences, “I was so young at that point- and I was going through all my own stuff in school and the thoughts I was having about like [my gender]” (Eve), portraying a sense of powerlessness in the face of cumulative, overwhelming stressors beyond their capacity to cope with, “I felt so young but so old” (Luke). Participants’ accounts of how they responded to these accumulating external stressors were dominated by a sense of helplessness and normalisation which reduced their motivation to seek help, “I was just saying well it’s the  68  cards that I’ve been dealt with in life you know, this is just my life, you know this was just my normality” (Cameron).   Participants placed the discovery of their transgender identity within the context of psychological saturation and an already depleted capacity for coping. Below, Sebastien’s use of ‘upheaval’ reflects an anticipatory stress of disclosure; a sense of likely unpredictable or negative consequences and significant disruption to their life. They demonstrate how this minority stress further adds to this accumulation of stressors, which simultaneously reduces their preparedness or readiness to explore their gender identity, thus maintaining and perpetuating distress.  “I was not ready to be thinking about- I was like I’d already done the upheaval of coming out as gay, I didn’t want to lose that label, I didn’t want to be a man, I didn’t want to- it was just- I wasn’t ready for any of that stuff.” (Sebastien)  Navigating Norms Participants described challenges in understanding their experiences of gender dysphoria through comparisons with social norms, within the context of cisnormativity. They often described a period prior to the discovery of their transgender identity whereby they struggled to name their dysphoria, leading to heightening suicidal distress and reduced ability to seek help, “I couldn’t understand why I was feeling like this … I was getting really low, I was crying at school, I couldn’t really explain it to people” (Cameron).    69  Luke describes misinterpreting gender dysphoria as “a problem with me, rather than something I was struggling with”, leading to self-stigma and further suicidal distress. Below, Luke struggles to describe and quantify the impact of this misinterpretation, instead describing a sense of relief that younger trans youth may have different norms to draw upon and greater clarity of gender-related self-concept. His repetition of ‘so so so’ further exemplifies this relief, and conversely the impact that the misinterpretation of gender dysphoria had on his distress and coping: “If I had known earlier that gender dysphoria was a thing or that like mental health issues were a thing emm and like, I, I, just things would have been so different … I’m just so so so glad that emm other people emm like there is the, there is the, the opportunity that other people don’t have to go through all of that”. (Luke)  Similarly, Eve conveyed increasing negative affect in response to her reattributing her gender experience as ‘abnormal’ as she entered adolescence; a developmental stage whereby identity development and social norms become increasingly central to our world view: “…when I was in my early teens, before I came out as transgender - I think that’s when [self-harm] started … like growing up like I always- I thought it  was quite normal to be the way I was … I thought I was female. I thought that was like the norm, and then starting secondary school that’s when I was like ‘this isny the norm like to be like this’.” (Eve)   70  Eve goes on to highlight how social norms and stigma negatively influenced others’ responses to her help-seeking, thus further reinforcing her negative gender-related self-concept:    “…everybody I’d reach out to- I wouldn’t feel like I would like get the help or get the like people understanding like what I was going through, they’d just think that like that I was like fucked in the head basically.” (Eve)  Intent  The second superordinate theme deals with how participants make sense of what they gained by acting on their self-harm and suicidality. Three interrelated subthemes emerged that may reflect the intent behind these behaviours for participants: i) communication of need, ii) dealing with dysphoria, and iii) escape from despair.  Communication of need Self-harm and suicidality were often described as ways to communicate an unmet need; seeking care and emotional validation from others in response to distress. Sebastien conveys a profound sense throughout of being physically present within their family yet alone in their distress, with their emotional needs being overlooked. They reflected on their thoughts of self-injury and suicidality as a means of communicating their pain, “I just wanted someone to notice that I wasn’t very happy” (Sebastien).   71  Participants described how self-harm and/or suicidality was often reinforced by responses from others that met their need for validation or care. Eve described connection to an adult within her school that was fostered through these communications of distress, “it was just nice to hear that somebody cared about you” (Eve). Cameron placed his self-harm and suicidality within the context of interpersonal conflict, describing a view that his existence was disregarded by his caregivers. He portrays a ‘turning-point’ in his narrative, born from a compassionate response to his self-harm:  “…it’s was almost as if [the image] would just flash in my head - just sitting on my mum’s couch and having her just come up and hug me, and it was pretty powerful and then almost after a couple of weeks the thoughts of self-harming just would stop … I think it was because I, I’ve seen her cry before, but because she was crying over something I’d done … I didn’t actually expect her to be so upset about it and she embraced me in such a big hug and stuff like that and she was supportive, more supportive than she’d ever been, and that’s really what took- it took me so back and it really kind of shocked me and I was like ‘fuck’, you know?” (Cameron).   Arguably, Cameron’s self-harm reduced in line with a reduction in his urge to communicate his unmet need for care and nurture, highlighting the protective impact that the mental representation of a compassionate caregiver had on his coping.  Dealing with Dysphoria  72  Participants provided powerful accounts of self-harm as a means of responding to a self that was considered flawed or ‘abnormal’, within the context of gender dysphoria. Eve recalled the dulling of dysphoria that was achieved through self-harm;  “I would look at girls and I’d be like- I want to be like that, that’s what I would like. I’d do anything to be like just like that, like so normal and em and I remember I’d like I’d take a knife and I’d press really hard like really like going harder and harder and just to feel the pain and I think it would numb me in a way.” (Eve)  Sebastien described avoiding exploration of self throughout, “I just didn’t feel right as a human being. It was just… everything felt wrong and I would just ignore it”, and consistently conveyed thoughts of self-harm as a means of maladaptive coping/avoidance of distress:  “…I would think about hurting myself but then that’s also upsetting and making it worse in the long run and it was like “oh my god I’m doing rubbish at this, think about breaking your arms” or whatever to distract from that but then that was also upsetting” (Sebastien)  Similarly, Luke spoke of seeking clarity and control over his experience of gender dysphoria. In the context of an ambiguous pain that was challenging to name, he described instead expressing this pain through self-harm and suicidality. Luke describes an intense hatred of his self and body which he describes having sought to control through restrictive eating, with self-harm being also framed as punishment: “…partly relief like just expressing mental pain physically and partly em punishment for what I perceived to be bad eating habits” (Luke).  73   Escape from despair A portrayal of a perpetual despair from which there felt no alternative escape was evident throughout. Luke recalls what he hoped to gain from an attempt to end his life: “…seeking relief from all this pain and seeking control over all this pain and emm over life in general. Emm, everything was just so overwhelming, everything was just- I couldn’t see an end, I couldn’t see any way of this getter better … I just wanted everything, all the pain to stop” (Luke).  Luke’s continual use of ‘everything’ magnifies his sense of desperation and hopelessness in the face of an emotional pain that defines and controls his life. As a result, his description demonstrates a narrowing of perspective and ability to consider alternative means of alleviating this distress.  Eve describes her emotional experience as a monster in her head through which there is little escape. She goes on to place her suicidality as a means to unburden herself from unrelenting conflict, “I think I’d be better off dead and I’d just… to be at peace” (Eve).  Similarly, Cameron described a sense of calm and acceptance that occurred after finalising his suicide plans. His use of ‘survival plan’ below to describe suicidality draws parallels with an ‘escape route’ and is a striking example of how for some, the knowledge of a possible finality to unbearable distress provides a sense of safety and possible means to cope:   74  “…I was just like I canny cope with this anymore, I canny cope, and it got to- em, I still had those thoughts of suicide and even though I’d stopped self-harming I still had that like survival plan, it was suicide- like, right if anything happened at school this is what I was going to do.” (Cameron)   Hope and Resilience  The third superordinate theme deals with how participants make sense of reducing self-harm and suicidality. Two interrelated subthemes emerge that may reflect internal and external processes which contribute to increasing resiliency: i) I can be me, and ii) social connectedness.  I can be me Narratives shared a sense of hopefulness for the future that occurred in line with a positive reappraisal of self and further transgender identity development. Eve described a period whereby distress and subsequent self-harm and suicidality were diminished in light of reduced conflict of self following coming out:  “I [came out] and after that I thought like- I didn’t have any suicidal thoughts. For the first like two years as being out as trans I was like in my element, I was just being happy that I could finally be me.” (Eve)   75  Her use of ‘in my element’ to describe the impact of being able to live as a trans woman communicates a sense of a flourishing self that feels unstoppable in the face of adversity. Often participants described a social process by which their understanding of their selves in relation to others shifted and precipitated a reduction in harmful behaviours. Sebastien describes a ‘life-changing’ experience whereby they met people representative of their own gender identity. Their account below references a previous appraisal of a flawed, or ‘boring’ self, contrasting this with a sense of elation at the realisation that their gender identity, and arguably their self, is both valid and acceptable:  “I met people who were non-binary. I didn’t- I didn’t know-  it still gets me a bit sometimes like (funny voice) “ooh.. you’re really allowed to be non-binary? Ha! - that’s what the crazy Americans do! (laughs) that’s not what the more boring people do!” …. Yeah no it.. gave me hope. People had like, lives and careers and families” (Sebastien)  Moreover, Sebastien demonstrates how this reappraisal of self allowed them to overcome hopelessness and uncertainty for the future, which was maintained by a struggle with a concept of self and gender identity that didn’t fit with their understanding of what their future should contain. Luke described a shift in his narrative whereby suicidal ambivalence became evident, “one little switch that wasn’t flipped anymore” (Luke). When making sense of this experience, he describes increasing hopefulness upon meeting other trans people who were taking steps toward their transition. He conveys how this lead to the ability to define his self as transgender and develop a mental representation of a favourable future:  “I think I felt a lot more hopeless emm, especially before I started understanding what I was experiencing was partly gender dysphoria …. that was the one flip, the main  76  switch even, it just kind of gave me that little bit of hope …. there was just this little spark of hope that I can “oh like things can be different later on” (Luke)  Social Connectedness Participants described how the development of positive interpersonal relationships and a sense of belongingness had a profound and positive impact on their psychological well-being and ability to cope with adversity. Cameron explicitly makes reference to a widening social network, encompassing family, friends, a romantic relationship and various social organisations, when reflecting on his current absence of self-harm and suicidality:   “But em so [my support network’s] a lot different from what it was now, at the time it was barely non-existent I would say. I’d be quite comfortable saying that – I did not have a support system at that time. And now it’s, you know, quite cooshty.”(Cameron)  Sebastien described a ‘turning-point’ in their experience of suicidality, dominated by descriptions of social connectedness. Their quote below highlights their development of a sense of belongingness, leading to an increase in positive affect and self-esteem:  “So everywhere you walk, like someone was happy to see you. Five full days of like- unconditional positive regard. Do you know what I mean? People happy to see you and interested in you …. it gave me an idea that I could- that one I existed as a human being that other people would be interested to hear from” (Sebastien)   77  Moreover, Sebastian’s description of coming to feel that they existed as part of the human race underscores their previous sense of profound isolation.  Threats to Resilience The fourth superordinate theme deals with how participants make sense of a fragile balance between protective and risk factors. In particular, additional risk factors that increased in line with their transition. Two interrelated subthemes emerge that may reflect additional minority stressors which can threaten resilience and may contribute to risk of self-harm and/or suicidality: i) prejudice and discrimination, and ii) unmet needs.  Prejudice and Discrimination Participants provided multiple and varying accounts of prejudice and discrimination which lead to a reduced sense of safety and increased negative affect. These experiences were demonstrated through both general social interactions and within close interpersonal relationships. Eve’s account was dominated at times by experiences of prejudice and discrimination, including being the victim of hate crimes within the community. She made sense of her increasing suicidality in this context, sharing that these experiences had the power to outweigh resilience factors at times: “I’ve been… I got spat on once off a guy and I remember that, that night was ho- horrible. I had to go home, I went home crying. I think that’s like- that’s the point it’s like when you go home and then you go back home yourself and like you’re dealing with all those thoughts enough” (Eve)  78   For Eve, microaggressions within romantic relationships were also conveyed frequently and appeared core to a reduction in resilience for her, “I would feel like I was a toy or like I’d get used as a fetish, just not as a real human being”. These subtle communications of prejudice were highlighted throughout Cameron’s account of his family’s response to him being transgender, such as his family’s refusal to use his name or pronouns. For example, he spoke of his brother choosing instead to use the name of a cartoon character, likening his gender identity to a costume: “My brother has been very good, he won’t call me [deadname] but he won’t call me Cameron, he’ll call me [cartoon character] who I dressed up as for Halloween one year.” (Cameron)  There was the sense that Cameron had come to appraise these interpersonal communications as ‘acceptable’ or ‘better than before’, despite the negative impact that they have on his sense of self-worth, in order to be able to make use of the social support within these relationships. Participants also reflected on how increasing trans visibility within society can also have negative consequences for the trans community, “awful people talking about [trans people] now and spreading mis-information” (Luke).  As a result, participants describe negotiating their own visibility within society, in line with awareness of discrimination. Sebastien’s example shows a process by which they understand distress on a continuum between being feeling safe/invisible but dysphoric vs being unsafe/visible and comfortable with their gender presentation:  79  “I think things have changed a lot [in a positive way], but also I think it’s, ironically in the last few years it’s much more acceptable to be a knobhead .... I worry about my own safety …. I feel a bit more exposed to [prejudice] because [now] people know that there’s something to clock and if they’re going to be angry about it then they know it’s - me. Whereas [4 years ago] they were angry at some concept that they saw on the telly …. I feel more visible, although weirdly I feel less visible now because of the way my body has changed [recently]. Thank god nobody can see me but also can those people not see me, you know can I close my eyes?” (Sebastien)  At times Sebastien describes actively accounting for and balancing these factors, for example by wearing more feminine hairstyles at work so as not to ‘rock the boat’.  Unmet needs Whilst reflecting on their lived experiences, the desire for services that are equipped with the knowledge, skills and capacity to provide care for trans people was described by all participants, including both gender affirming services and mental health services.  Participants expressed uncertainty and hopelessness when faced with the task of accessing gender affirming services; “Like [gender clinic] waiting lists are so long and in that way I felt hopeless” (Luke).  Participants’ narratives suggest a belief that trans people’s needs are being minimized or ignored. Sebastien questions why stretched gender services and unmet needs aren’t prompting an emergency response, perhaps indicating that should another area of health care or group within the population be experiencing similar challenges, then greater efforts would be made to curtail these:   80   “…it makes me so angry and makes me feel like I’m not important, and that I’m less important than other people. And they’re saying, “but we’re busy”, I understand that you’re busy but you’re not looking after- like, this is not a system which can look after people so why is this not an emergency? .... it feels like they don’t care.” (Sebastien)  Participants’ accounts, like Sebastien’s above, parallel the emotionally invalidating responses to expressions of distress and help-seeking that participants conveyed in their journey towards self-harm and suicidality. Cameron described being deflated by an adult mental health service that was ill-equipped to consider trans specific experiences/stressors when thinking about his psychological well-being. As he conveys below, there was a sense that his needs remained unmet, with his use of ‘shot it down’ mirroring his previous descriptions of his needs being ‘squashed’ by others:  “I’d mentioned [being trans] to them but they shot it down, they were like, “that’s not our department, we don’t want to deal with it, if you want to do that we can get you contact with the relevant information”, I was like, “*sigh* right, ok”” (Cameron)  Eve described feeling lost between a gender identity service that is perceived as more able to meet her needs, but is not a mental health service, and mental health services which are not trans-specific. Eve described anticipation of stigma or a response similar to that which Cameron received as barriers to engaging:  “I just backed out, but that was more because my anxiety, that was like, cause I wanted to talk to someone that was like- knew about trans and stuff like that ….  81  [mental health services] would just be- they never knew anything about like, like being trans or anything like that, down that side of it.” (Eve)  For Eve, this resulted in her declining timely formal support and later using a crisis help-line in response to increasing suicidal intent. Despite this, anticipated stigma was still present in Eve’s account, where she conveys a belief that general services are ‘not for trans people’: “I was thinking like oh my god is [Samaritan’s worker] going to be like- cause obviously like that’s not the- like if they get trans people phoning I was like, ‘is she gonny be alright that I’m trans?’”(Eve).  Discussion The current study explored transgender individuals’ lived experience of self-harm and suicidality, and provided the opportunity to understand how trans individuals viewed changes in risk and resilience at various stages in their lives. Following IPA analysis, four superordinate themes emerged: i) early experiences, ii) intent, iii) hope and resilience, and iv) threats to resilience. The main findings and unique contributions are discussed in detail, with reference to existing literature. The methodological strengths and limitations are noted, before discussing implications for clinical practice and research.  Early experiences associated with an increased risk of self-harm and suicidality  Consistent with existing research, the current study highlights the role of perceived family invalidation and perceived peer invalidation in contributing to youth self-harm and  82  suicidality (Adrian, Berk, Korslund et al., 2018; Yen, Kuehn, Tezanos, et al., 2015). The perceived invalidation or rejection of participants’ emotional experiences was described as having compromised their attachment to caregivers and interpersonal connectedness, which may have contributed to thwarted belongingness and consequently suicidal desire, in line with the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (Van Orden, Witte, Cukrowicz et al., 2010). Early adversity and disrupted attachment experiences have consistently been associated with suicidality (Fergusson, Woodward & Horwood, 2000; Turecki & Brent, 2016), however the current findings suggest these experiences may also complicate the internal and external process of gender identity exploration for trans individuals. Participants reflected on an accumulation of stressful childhood experiences, with transgender identity development positioned as an additional source of distress within this context of elevated vulnerability. Further research is required to understand this interaction, however these environmental and social stressors may compromise an individual’s sense of safety and capacity to cope with excess stress associated with minority status, such as anticipated rejection, identity concealment and internalized transphobia (Meyer, 2003; Rood, Reisner, Surace et al., 2016).   Although not directly measured, participants’ reported cumulative stressors (including emotional neglect, domestic violence, parental substance misuse and ill-mental health) could also be considered Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), which are significantly associated self-harm and suicide risk within the general population (Choi, Dinitto, Marti & Segal, 2017; Fuller-Thomson, Barid, Dhrodia & Brennenstuhl, 2016). These findings are in line with Austin et al. (2020) who first explored the impact of ACEs on suicidality within the trans population, and found that emotional neglect lead to 2.5 times increased risk of lifetime suicide attempt.  Future research may help to further explore the relationship between ACEs, minority stressors and self-harm and/or suicidality within the transgender population.  83   The analysis illuminated how cisnormativity may contribute to unique risk for trans individuals, with participants describing a lack of gender-related self-concept clarity (i.e. difficulty understanding and verifying own gender identity or expression) and self-concept negativity within this context (i.e. negative cognitions or emotions related to own gender identity or expression). Kuper, Adams and Mustanski (2018) found that gender-related self-concept negativity, but not lack of clarity, is positively associated with suicidal ideation within the trans population. Conversely, the current study suggests a relationship between clarity of gender-related self-concept and risk of self-harm and suicidality, perhaps due to capturing qualitative data from individuals reflecting on various stages of their gender-identity development, or due to including both self-harm and suicidality as phenomena of interest.  These early experiences also shaped participants’ help-seeking, whereby participants described difficulties appraising their distress, experiencing internal and external stigma, and a normalisation of their distress as barriers to seeking help. At times, experiences of help-seeking were described negatively (e.g. due to rejection, invalidation, stigma), which both increased distress and reduced their motivation to seek further help. For trans individuals, understanding the components of their distress (e.g. emotional distress due to life experiences in addition gender dysphoria) and stigma may be more prominent, however further qualitative research may help to examine barriers and facilitators to trans individuals seeking formal and informal support when experiencing suicidal distress in greater depth.   84  The intent behind self-harm and suicidality Current findings expand existing literature describing the communicative and social function of self-harm and suicidality (Cipriano, Cella & Cotrufo, 2017; Grimmond et al., 2019), whereby participants expressed a desire to communicate their distress, seeking emotional validation and compassion from others. Self-harm as a means to distract from or reduce gender dysphoria was noted, lending support to literature highlighting trans-specific motivations for self-harm (Morris & Galupo, 2019). Further, in-depth qualitative research may help to explore trans-specific motivations for self-harm and/or suicidality. A desire to escape an intolerable psychological pain, or ‘psychache’ (Shneidman, 1985), in the context of depleted adaptive coping strategies, was key to participants’ narratives of the intentions underlying their suicidality in particular. Findings are in line with the integrated motivational-volitional model of suicidal behaviour which documents the role of entrapment in the emergence of suicidal motivation, moderated by deficits in problem solving and coping (O’Connor & Kirtley, 2018).   Protective factors associated with decreased risk of self-harm and suicidality  The ability to conceptualise and self-define your own gender has been suggested as a resilience strategy for trans youth (Singh, Meng, & Hansen, 2014). Moody, Fuks, Pelaez & Smith (2015) described the process of realisation, understanding and acceptance of transgender identity as protective against suicidal ideation for trans individuals. The current study replicates these findings and illuminates how the process of positive group identity development may play a role in cultivating hope and transnormativity. The current study mirrors existing literature suggesting greater perceived social support enhances psychological resilience (Grossman, D’Augelli & Frank, 2011; Singh et al., 2014) and reduces suicide risk  85  (Moody et al., 2015). However studies have also cautioned that increased social support may not independently reduce risk of suicidality within the trans population (Austin, Craig, D’Souza, McInroy, 2020). Again, further research is required to understand the processes underlying resilience and risk reduction within this population.   Factors which threatened the resilience of participants Moving on from periods of suicidality and self-harm seemed to coincide with increasing resilience; however, subsequent threats to resilience were also discussed. Prejudice and discrimination are well-recognised risk factors for self-harm and suicidality within the trans population (Marshalle et al., 2016; McNeil et al., 2017). Bockting, Barucco & LeBlanc et al. (2020) recently noted that greater trans visibility within society, although undoubtedly a positive step, unfortunately may also increase trans individuals’ experiences of prejudice and discrimination. The current study supports these findings, and provides additional insights into how trans individuals may respond as these minority stressors become increasingly salient. Participants describe feeling ‘more exposed’ and increasingly worried about their safety in recent years as the wider population, some of whom may hold prejudice and discriminatory beliefs toward the transgender population, become increasingly concerned with trans individuals. As a result, participants described moderating their gender expression or gender-affirming needs to preserve a felt sense of safety, which is particularly noteworthy given that positive self-identity factors (i.e. ‘I can be me’ theme) were protective for individuals. Similar cognitive and emotional responses to anticipated discrimination for transgender individuals were summarised by Rood, Reisner & Surace (2016), including fear, anxiety, and hypervigilance.   86  Consistent with the existing literature, challenges in accessing inclusive mental health care and gender-affirming services were, unsurprisingly, described as significant stressors (Ellis, Bailey & McNeil, 2015) as well as being threats to participants’ resilience (Singh et al., 2014). Current findings underscore how experiences of/anticipated stigma within a healthcare context is a barrier to receiving appropriate, timely mental health care, including when experiencing suicidal distress. Current findings lend some support to the hypothesis that trans people may be more likely to seek help only when a crisis point is reached (McDermott et al., 2018; Effrig, Bieschke & Locke, 2011). Importantly, the current study demonstrates how health care inequalities contribute to a profound sense of hopelessness, frustration and unmet need for a group of individuals who experience elevated risk of negative outcomes, including self-harm and suicidality (Marshall et al., 2016; McNeil et al., 2017).  Strengths and Limitations  The findings represent the in-depth experiences of a small sample of trans individuals, and so are suggestive as opposed to conclusive. Additionally, the sample includes only young trans adults who have accessed gender-affirming health care. As suggested by Smith, Flowers and Larkin (2009) the themes were contextualised and substantiated by the inclusion of excerpts thereby assisting the reader in determining the transferability of the findings to others. Similarly, non-binary and gender non-conforming individuals are underrepresented within research (Wolford-Clevenger et al., 2018) and so recruitment sought to be as inclusive as possible. However, it is acknowledged that trans experiences are not universal and so the inclusion of multiple gender identities may have decreased the homogeneity of the sample. The current study discusses the experiences of one minority group. Difficulty exists in generalising the current results to other minority groups who may be at greater risk of  87  suicidality, due to the diversity in their lived experiences and the factors that may increase risk and/or reduce protective factors (e.g. culture, barriers to help-seeking, social norms, access to healthcare, poverty, substance misuse, stigma, and social exclusion).    Similarly, the current study explored first-hand accounts of self-harm and/or suicidality from a non-clinical sample of transgender adults, although the majority of participants had not experienced self-harm or suicidal distress in a number of years. Therefore the results represent individuals who were experiencing, or had experienced, a prolonged period of psychological stability and so the integrity or depth of their accounts may have been reduced given the elapsed time since the acute distress. The current sample, however, allowed for a nuanced, unique perspective of how transgender individuals may experience psychosocial stressors and protective factors differently at various stages in their life.   The chosen qualitative methodology and IPA are considered strengths when exploring lived experiences; however they are not without limitations. As noted, the small sample sizes embraced in IPA may limit the generalisability of the results. The subjectivity of IPA could also be considered a limitation, whereby two researchers may interpret the same account differently. A second researcher therefore reviewed transcripts and emerging codes to increase reliability, and no disagreements were noted. Given the retrospective nature of the qualitative interviews, there is increased likelihood that accounts are subject to recall bias due to additional, subsequent insights. The interview schedule could be improved for future research as the discussions regarding help-seeking naturally occurred throughout accounts of psychosocial protective/risk factors, as opposed to a separate area of discussion.   88   Clinical Implications The interviews point to a number of factors which may complicate identity development for trans youth and thus increase distress and risk of self-harm or suicidality. As our understanding of gender continues to advance, educating health professionals, young people, schools and the wider population on gender and transgender identities may help to play a role in reducing cisnormativity and stigma, and in turn help to normalise gender identity development for trans youth. Similarly, mental health services should have the ability meet trans individual needs, regardless of what presenting problems arise. Services should validate transgender individuals’ lived experiences and seek to reduce sources of stigma; for example, by withholding making cisnormative assumptions regarding someone’s gender identity or expression and maintain a reflective stance regarding their own implicit biases. It is vital that clinicians possess the knowledge and skills required to deliver risk assessments that encompass both trans-specific experiences and general factors known to increase risk of self-harm and/or suicidality. Healthcare providers and professional courses (e.g. Doctorates in Clinical Psychology) should consider learning outcomes that reflect the needs of transgender individuals and other minority groups.   Barriers to help-seeking may be reduced if referrers are able to discuss the enhanced learning practices that local community mental health teams have implemented to ensure they are best able to meet their needs. Culturally inclusive informal support should also be offered, in addition to those that individuals are often directed to (e.g. Samaritans). Engagement in psychological therapy may also be facilitated by addressing gender and power dynamics early within the therapeutic relationships. The current study also highlights the protective role of  89  increased resilience for participants, and thus psychological therapies aimed at enhancing internal and external resilience strategies may help to prevent suicide within the trans population. Dickey and Budge (2020) provide an overview of how psychological interventions play a key role in supporting trans individuals, highlighting interventions that focus on self-compassion and aim to reduce the impact of proximal minority stressors on psychological well-being.   The socio-political context is also relevant to suicide prevention. Policy reform that protects the rights, dignity and well-being of transgender people is imperative. The increasing visibility of trans individuals, which may place them at further risk of prejudice and discrimination, commands these protections urgently. Policies and processes should challenge the social norms that maintain stigma for trans individuals, reduce restrictions to resilience factors for trans individuals (e.g. being able to self-define their own gender (or ‘I can be me’)), and address mental and physical healthcare inequalities. The focus on healthcare inequalities is particularly relevant in the context of Covid-19, whereby healthcare services were halted or vastly reduced, which may exacerbate existing barriers to health care and threats to psychological well-being for trans individuals (van der Miesen, Raaijmakers, & van de Grift, 2020; Wang, Pan & Liu, 2020).   Future Directions The discussion has highlighted a number of directions for future research, including efforts to better understand: i) the impact that increasing trans visibility may have on the lives of trans individuals, ii) trans-specific motivations for self-harm and suicidality, and iii) the  90  relationship between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and suicidality within the trans population. Future qualitative research may provide rich insights into similarities and divergence between trans individuals who report a history of/life-time suicide attempt and recent attempts.   Conclusion The current study describes how transgender individuals may experience psychosocial factors related to self-harm and suicidality differently across various stages of their lives. For example, adverse early relationships and experiences may complicate the process of gender identity development and help-seeking, whereas healthcare inequalities and increasing minority stressors may later threaten resilience. Important insights into both the processes underlying the relationship between resilience and suicide risk, and the motivations for self-harm and suicidality within the trans population emerged. There remains a need for further empirical research to fully understand self-harm and suicidality within the transgender population.      91  References Adams, N., Hitomi, M., Moody, C.

The historical view of gender being wholly binary (e.g. male/female) does not accurately reflect the spectrum of gender expression (Richards et al., 2016). Therefore transgender people may describe a number of different personal experiences of gender; including transmen, transwomen, non-binary, gender diverse and genderqueer identities (Vincent, 2018). Trans people may also have a fluid gender identity and so may identify with more than one term at any given time, or the term they identify with may change over time (McNeil, Ellis & Eccles, 2017). Importantly, sexual orientation and gender identity are distinctly separate.   Cisgender  The term cisgender (or ‘cis’) describes individuals whose gender assumed at birth reflects their gender identity.      104  Appendix 1.3: PROSPERO registration   105   106   107     108  Appendix 1.4: ASSIA database search   109    110      111  Appendix 1.5: CINHAL database search   112    113   114   115      116  Appendix 1.6: COCHRANE database search 117   118   119      120  Appendix 1.7: EMBASE database search  121   122   123      124  Appendix 1.8: Psychology & Behavioural Sciences database search 125   126   127   128   129   130      131  Appendix 1.9: PsycARTICLES database search 132   133   134   135   136   137   138      139  Appendix 1.10: PsycINFO database search 140   141   142     143  Appendix 1.11: Data extraction tool Data Extraction       Paper Number  Citation   Study Characteristics Study Author(s): Title: Year: Location: Study purpose/aims:    Sample Characteristics Inclusion/exclusion criteria: Gender identities: Size: Age range: Mean age: Recruitment: Other:   Data Collection/Analysis Design:  Method:  Measures used:    Analysis:    Findings Results:      144    Main findings:     Discussion:      Strengths:    Limitations:     Any other notes           145  Appendix 1.12: Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool (CCAT)  146      147  Appendix 1.13: Quality appraisal ratings    Author/Year Preliminaries Introduction Design Sampling Data Collection Ethical Matters Results Discussion Total Score  Descriptive 1.

(2012)   A taxonomy of transgender microaggressions (or 12 themes of transgender microaggressions) was first proposed by Nadal et al. (2012)(noted at Study 7 within results of review), based on findings from qualitative exploration (focus groups) with nine transgender-identified men and women.  1) use of transphobic and/or incorrectly gendered terminology includes using incorrect pronouns or derogatory language when addressing trans people. 2) assumption of universal transgender experience encompasses when individuals assume that all trans individuals are the same or expect certain gendered roles/stereotypes to be performed.  3) exoticization, occurs when trans people are treated as tokens or objects.  4)  discomfort/disapproval of transgender experience, occurs when an individual receives verbal or non-verbal communications of disgust or discomfort following disclosure of the transgender status.  5) endorsement of gendernormative and binary culture or behaviours, reflects communications of gendered stereotypes (e.g. women assumed to be physically weaker than men), particularly when experienced as incongruent to own gender identity (e.g. trans man assumed as weaker than cis man).  6) denial of existence of transphobia, manifests when minimise or deny the existence and impacts of transphobia generally  7) denial of individual transphobia, occurs when individuals fail to consider their individual role in perpetrating transphobia.  8) assumption of sexual pathology or abnormality, refers to assumptions that trans identities are pathological (e.g. occur as result of psychopathology or sexual deviance).  9) physical threat or harassment includes reports of being overtly threatened based on gender identity   10) denial of bodily privacy occurs for example when trans individuals are asked intimate question regarding their body or when individuals visually assess trans individuals physical characteristics against gendered norms.   11) Familial microaggressions  12) Systemic and Environmental Microaggressions  149  Appendix 1.15 Reported effect sizes of significant results for included studies where appropriate.

We would like to invite you to take part in a research study. Before you decide, you need to understand why the research is being done and what participation would involve. Please read the following information carefully. Talk to others about the study if you wish, and please ask if there is anything that is unclear or if you would like more information.  Who is conducting the research? The research is being carried out by Lisa Ballantyne, Trainee Clinical Psychologist, from the University of Glasgow. It is being supervised by Professor Rory O’Connor from the University of Glasgow and Dr Katie Smith from the Sandyford Gender Identity Clinic.  What is the purpose of the study? The study is being carried out as part of the requirements of the Doctorate in Clinical Psychology training course at the University of Glasgow. The purpose of the study is to try to better understand transgender individuals’ experiences of self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviours. The study will involve speaking to people whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth, who have had thoughts of self-harm or suicide. The study aims to understand more about factors which may contribute to thoughts of self-harm or suicide, and what factors influence how they may seek help when feeling distressed. A better understanding of these factors may help people who are vulnerable to suicide.   Why have I been invited? We are looking to recruit between 4 and 10 people who have self-referred or are currently attending a Scottish Gender Identity Clinic. Participants should be aged over 17 years old, whose gender identity is different from their sex assigned at birth. To take part, participants should also have a history of self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviour.   What does taking part involve? If you think that you fit the criteria and are interested in taking part, you can return the slip attached to your invitation letter or email your interest to Lisa Ballantyne, the lead researcher Researcher Contact Information Lisa Ballantyne, Trainee Clinical Psychologist Email: l.ballantyne.2@research.gla.ac.uk  Institute of Mental Health & Well-being Administration Building, 1st Floor Gartnavel Royal Hospital 1055 Great Western Road Glasgow G12 0XH    160  (l.ballantyne.2@research.ac.uk). Lisa will then telephone you to tell you more about the study, answer any questions you have, and, if you decide to take part, make an appointment for you to take part in an interview. The interviews will take place at Sandyford Central (Glasgow) or Chalmers Centre (Edinburgh) and will last around 1 hour. This will feel like an informal discussion with the researcher about your experiences of self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviour. You do not have to answer any questions that you don’t want to and you can have breaks during the interview if you wish.   You will be asked to complete a short risk assessment both before and after the interview. This will involve answering a number of questions which are asked by the researcher to help identify if there are any current risks to yourself or others that would need to be considered. The personal data generated by this will be held for up to 3 years in accordance with relevant Data Protection policies and regulations; this is discussed in detail below.   If you disclose anything during the interview or risk assessment that causes the researcher concern, such as being a risk to yourself or others, the researcher will have a duty to report this but will try to discuss this with you before doing so.   With your permission, the interview will be audio recorded so that the researcher can listen back to the conversation and identify the key points that you made. Some quotes from your interview may be included in the research paper, however all information will be anonymised.  We will write to your GP to tell them that you have taken part in this study.  Do I have to take part? No. It is up to you to decide if you want to take part in the study or not. If you agree to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form at the time of the interview to show that you have agreed to take part in the study. You are free to withdraw from the study at any time until the research is written up, without giving a reason. Withdrawing from the study would not affect the standard of care you receive or your future treatment in any way.  What happens to the information? Your information will be held at the University of Glasgow. Your identity and personal information will be completely confidential and held in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR; 2018), which means that we keep it safely and cannot reveal it to other people without your permission. NHS GG&C is the sponsor for this study based in the United Kingdom. We will be using information from you and/or your medical records in order to undertake this study and will act as the data controller for this study. We will store your personal data for up to 3 years. Anonymised data generated through interviews will be stored for up to 10 years in the University of Glasgow archiving facilities in accordance with relevant Data Protection policies and regulations.  The results of this study may be published in academic journals, conference proceedings and as a piece of work for a doctoral qualification in Clinical Psychology. A summary of results will be made available to participants who would like feedback about the research once completed. Some direct quotes from your interview may be included in these reports/publications, however all information will be anonymised with pseudonyms and it will not be possible to personally identify you from this information.   Your rights to access, change or move your information are limited, as we need to manage your information in specific ways in order for the research to be reliable and accurate. If you withdraw from the  161  study, we will keep the information about you that we have already obtained. To safeguard your rights, we will use the minimum personally-identifiable information possible.  You can find out more about how we use your information at - https://www.nhsggc.org.uk/media/249727/gdpr-publish.pdf  What are the possible benefits of taking part? Whilst your taking part will not have any direct impact on your own care, it is hoped that it will allow us to improve our understanding of people with similar problems. You will contribute to research in this area which may help people who are at risk of self-harm or suicide. If, for any reason, you experience distress during or after the interview, we will ensure that you are able to access appropriate sources of support, where these are required.  Who has reviewed the study? The study has been reviewed by the West of Scotland research ethics committee 3, the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Research & Development Department, NHS Lothian Quality Improvement Team and the NHS GGC Sandyford Research Governance Group (RGG).

As you will now be aware, the research that we are doing involves asking between 4 and 10 people to take part in this one-off interview. So today I will be asking you some questions which relate to your experiences of self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts and behaviours. There are no right or wrong answers; I am interested in your own personal experience. If at any time there are questions which you don’t want to answer, that is okay; you don’t have to. Alternatively, if there is anything you feel is important and would like to talk about, please feel free to just bring these up. It is also fine if you would like to take a break at any point. If you want to stop the interview at any time, please just let me know.   Experience of self-harm and or suicidal thoughts and behaviours - I am interested to know more about your experiences of self-harm or suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Can you tell me about the first time you began to experience thoughts of suicide and/or self-harm?   o Probe: Can you describe those thoughts to me? What do you remember about those thoughts?  o Probe: What was going on in your life at this time? Who was in your life at this time? What sense do you make of your experience of thoughts of suicide and/or self-harm?  o Do the thoughts change over time? If so, how do they change? Why do you think this happens?   - What (if anything) limits the frequency/duration/severity of these thoughts?   o Probe: Have there been times when you have not acted on these thoughts?   - Can you tell me what factors (if any) reduce the likelihood of you acting on these thoughts?   o Probe: What sense do you make of this?  - If acted on thoughts..

Correlates of NSSI and suicidality within the trans-population are largely unknown due to limited high-quality research within this area. Furthermore, no research has explored trans-specific experiences of help-seeking for NSSI and suicidality to date. Help-seeking is an important factor in suicide prevention.  Aims: To explore transgender individuals’ experiences of NSSI and suicidality, and how they make sense of these phenomena. Through this exploration, we hope to uncover factors which may contribute to these experiences of NSSI and suicidality within this population. We also hope to further our understanding of transgender individuals’ perspectives on help-seeking. Method: A qualitative design will be used. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a small sample of transgender adults who report a history of NSSI and/or suicidality. Interview transcripts will then be analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Applications: Identification of factors which influence NSSI, suicidality and help-seeking in the transgender population will aid risk management and clinical interventions.     178  Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidality among transgender people: understanding correlates and help-seeking.   1. Introduction Transgender (or ‘trans’) people are individuals whose sense of felt gender (i.e. gender identity) differs from the gender assumed at birth, on the basis of the sex they were assigned (Vincent, 2018). The term cisgender (or ‘cis’) describes individuals whose gender assumed at birth reflects their gender identity. The historical view of gender being wholly binary (e.g. male/female) does not accurately reflect the spectrum of gender expression (Richards et al., 2016). Therefore transgender people may describe a number of different personal experiences of gender; including transmen, transwomen, non-binary, gender diverse and genderqueer identities (Vincent, 2018). Trans people may also have a fluid gender identity and so may identify with more than one term at any given time, or the term they identify with may change over time (McNeil, Ellis & Eccles, 2017). Importantly, sexual orientation and gender identity are distinctly separate.   1.1 Non-suicidal self-injury and suicidality Research has consistently shown that  trans individuals are more at risk of suicide than the cisgender population (Adams, Hitomi & Moody, 2017; Clements-Nolle, Marx and Katz, 2006; Haas, Rodgers & Herman, 2014; McNeil et al., 2017; Peterson, Matthews, Copps-Smith & Conard, 2017; Resiner et al., 2014). This disparity is also true when compared to other marginalised groups. For example, within the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) group, trans individuals are more likely to attempt suicide than the LGB population (Haas et al., 2014; Mustanski & Liu, 2013). One UK trans mental health survey (McNeil, Bailey, Ellis, Regan, & Morton, 2012) noted that the majority of respondents (84%) indicated current or historical suicidal ideation, with 48% of these individuals having attempted suicide at least once. A total of 51% and 11% of transgender adults report past year suicide ideation and attempts, respectively, across the USA and Canada (Adams et al., 2017). Similarly, Viripukasha, Muralidhar and Ramakrishna (2016) found lifetime rates of suicide attempts within the trans population to be between 32% and 52% globally. These prevalence rates are substantially higher than the cross-national lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation (9.2%) and attempts (2.7%) within the general population (Nock et al., 2008).   A higher prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) also exists within the trans population (between 19% and 39%), compared to the cis population (Marshall et al., 2016). NSSI, or self-harm, refers to intention self-inflicted damage one's own body tissue without suicidal ideation, and not consistent with cultural norms. Methods of NSSI include cutting, burning, scratching, and hitting oneself, which have been found to serve a variety of functions including affect regulation, self-punishment and social functions (Cipriano, Cella & Cotrufo, 2017).   A history of self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts are known risk factors of dying by suicide within the general population (Chan et al., 2017). However, despite the high prevalence rates of NSSI and suicidal behaviour within the trans population, the lifetime prevalence of trans individuals dying by suicide is currently unknown (Wolford-Clevenger, Cannon, Flores, Smith & Stuart, 2017). The lack of data in this area may reflect challenges in recording trans identities at time of death (McNeil et al., 2017). Although research within the transgender population has increased over recent years, this population is still vastly understudied. The high rates of NSSI and suicidality among trans people highlights the importance of continued research within this area, aimed at improving our understanding and prevention of suicide within this population.  1.2 Correlates of NSSI and Suicidality  179  A recent systematic review by McNeil et al. (2017) summarised the correlates of suicidal ideation and behaviours within the trans population. Environmental factors, specifically those related to minority stressors (e.g. discrimination, victimisation and social stigma), were identified as strongly related to suicidal ideation and attempts. Individual factors, such as co-morbid mental health difficulties and internalised transphobia, were also discussed as risk factors for ideation and attempts. Conversely, positive social interactions and timely access to interventions were noted as protective. Notably, trans individuals are not biologically predisposed to psychopathology, nor do they experience mental health difficulties differently from the cis population (Robles et al., 2016). Olsen et al., (2016) found that normative levels of mental health difficulties can be observed if individuals (in this case trans youth) are socially supported in their chosen gender identity, suggesting that psychopathology is not inherently part of a trans identity and again highlighting the protective nature of positive social interactions.  Similar risk factors have been described for NSSI among trans people, including discrimination, perceived lack of social support and interpersonal problems (Marshalle et al., 2016). Literature suggests that transmen (female-to-male) are particularly at risk of NSSI (Holt, Skagerburg & Dunsford, 2016; Peterson et al., 2017). One hypothesis is that being born phenotypically female may increase an individual’s risk of NSSI, as ciswomen are more at risk of self-harm than cismen (Marshalle et al., 2016). Further research is required to explore the relationship between specific gender identities and NSSI. The relationship between NSSI and suicidality within the trans population requires further attention; however recent research suggests a positive correlation between NSSI and suicide attempt history (Wolford-Clevenger, Smith, Flores & Stuart, 2018).   Wolford-Clevenger et al. (2018) systematically reviewed the literature from January 1991 to July 2017, to describe separately the correlates of ideation and attempts. Guided by an ideation-to-action framework (Klonsky & May, 2014), the authors described a number of internal and external minority stress experiences (e.g. prejudice/discrimination, victimisation, expectations of rejection, self-stigma) which, in combination, potentially contribute to psychological pain and thus drive suicidal ideation. In parallel with the general suicide literature, a positive correlation was found between suicide attempt history and fearsome and painful events among trans people. These events include both physical and sexual violence, substance misuse and, as discussed, NSSI. However, in contrast with our understanding that key fearful and physically painful events shift ideation toward attempts, internalised minority stressors were also positively correlated with a move from ideation to action for trans people. Further research efforts are needed to understand the factors which may contribute to a trans person’s capacity for suicide, particularly when considering the generalisation of existing suicide frameworks to a population which encompasses a range of uniquely trans-specific experiences.   Notably, this review highlighted the poor methodological quality of research within this area, with only 15% of the 45 included studies rated as good quality. Methodology was often limited by dichotomous measuring (e.g. lifetime prevalence vs absence) of both ideation (58% of studies) and attempts (80% of studies). Furthermore, of the studies which reported correlates of suicide attempts, none defined the key aspect of ‘intent to die’ (Freedenthal, 2007) when measuring attempted suicides. Thus the authors noted that any conclusions drawn regarding the correlates of suicidality in trans people should be considered tentatively, again highlighting the need for further empirical research in this area. Further qualitative research may help to provide context to the mechanisms underlying NSSI and suicidality risk for trans people.   1.3 Help-seeking behaviours To date, no research has explored help-seeking for NSSI and suicidality specifically within the adult trans population. Help-seeking is an important factor in suicide prevention. Within the general  180  population, research has sought to understand the formal (medical professionals and mental health services) and informal (self-help, social) help-seeking behaviours of individuals experiencing NSSI or suicidal distress (Hom, Stanley & Joiner, 2015; Rowe et al., 2014). Individual demographic factors (e.g. education level, socioeconomic status, culture, race, gender, age) influence the likelihood that a person will seek help when experiencing suicidal distress (Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2014). The existence of these group-specific differences, in addition to the substantial impact of attitudes and stigma on help-seeking (Calear, Batterham & Christensen, 2014), suggest that further suicide prevention research is needed to understand the underlying processes of trans-specific help-seeking behaviours.   Whilst exploring help-seeking in LGBT women who report general mental health difficulties, McNair and Bush (2016) found that transwomen reported barriers to seeking help including; fear of/prior experience of prejudice and/or discrimination (71%), concerns that providers will not be well informed/trans-sensitive (38%), and lack of readiness (45%). These findings appear in line with literature exploring both physical and mental health care use by trans people. The literature discusses experiences of/fear of stigma and discrimination within a healthcare context, fear of social consequences, and a belief that their needs will not be met, as barriers to transgender people fully utilising professional health services (Shipherd, Greene & Abramovitz, 2010; Poteat, German & Kerrigan, 2013).   A study by Effrig, Bieschke & Locke (2011) compared reported levels of psychological distress between treatment seeking and non-treatment seeking trans college students. They concluded that there was no significant difference in levels of psychological distress between groups, however, higher levels of suicidal ideation within the treatment-seeking group was observed. The authors hypothesised that trans people may be more likely to seek help only when a crisis point is reached. Methodological limitations however, including inclusion/exclusion criteria for each group, suggest interpretation of these results should be tentative.  However, a recent study by McDermott, Hughes and Rawlings (2017) may lend some support for this hypothesis.  McDermott et al., (2017) explored LGBT youth suicidality, self-harm and help-seeking (formal and informal). Like much of the transgender research, trans people were amalgamated within the LGBT category, thus significantly limiting our ability to draw informed conclusions on trans-specific experiences. Additionally, this study focused on youth LGBT (mean age 18) and so results were likely influenced by age-related variables. Nevertheless, this mixed-methods study serves as an initial starting point in exploring the process of help-seeking in trans people who experience suicidal distress. Qualitative interviews (41% of respondents were ‘trans or other’) identified three main themes that pose a challenge to help-seeking; negotiating norms (managing a heteronormative1 environment and fear of stigma), inability to discuss emotions (lack of trust/confidence speaking about difficulties, negotiating disclosure of LGBT status), and self-reliance (viewing help-seeking as a weakness, maladaptive strategies viewed as positive coping).   Similar to Effric et al., (2011), the authors concluded that LGBT individuals often normalise their psychological distress and so are more likely to seek help only when at a crisis point. Interestingly, McDermott et al., (2017) also reported being transgender, planned/attempted suicide, NSSI, and experience of abuse related to gender identity/sexual orientation as significant predictors of help-seeking for suicidality. However, they did not control for the possibility that trans individuals may experience these additional predictors at a higher frequency than cisgender individuals, which may in turn mediate the increased likelihood that trans people will seek support.                                                            1 Heteronormativity refers to the assumption that a binary gender identity (in line with sex assigned at birth) and heterosexuality are the norm. This often leads to the “othering” of people who do not conform to these assumed norms.   181   2. Aims The principal aim of the proposed research is to explore the lived experience of transgender individuals who report a history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviours, in order to better understand their experiences. The researcher will be guided by the participants in terms of themes for discussion, however the proposed research will explore the following topics; i) transgender individuals’ experiences of any psychosocial factors which may increase or decrease the likelihood that NSSI and/or suicidality will occur, and ii) their experiences of help-seeking in the context of experiencing NSSI and/or suicidality.   3. Plan 3.1 Design The proposed study will be of qualitative design. Semi-structured in-depth interviews will be conducted, and analysed using an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) framework.   3.2 Participants Participants will be recruited from the both the NHS GGC and NHS Lothian Gender Identity Clinic’s. Participants will be asked to (1) describe their gender identity and (2) identify the sex they were assigned at birth. The study will also collect socio-demographic data (e.g. age, race, religion, sexuality, postcode) to help account for intersectional experiences.  3.3 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  Inclusion criteria: (i) gender identity which is incongruent with sex assigned at birth (ii) report a history of NSSI and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviours (iii) aged 17 or over (iv) fluent in English. Exclusion criteria: (i) known forensic history or (ii) at imminent risk of suicide (assessed before participation).   3.4 Justification of Sample Size Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) embraces a “less is more” stance, suggesting that it is more desirable to explore themes from smaller sample sizes in great depth, as opposed to recruiting a larger sample which may provide broader, shallower, more descriptive themes (Reid, Flowers & Larkin, 2005). Therefore, studies employing IPA generally recruit between one and ten participants (Starks & Trinidad 2007). The proposed study seeks to recruit between 4 and 10 participants, which is the recommend total of participants for doctoral research (Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2009).   The sample size is considered feasible as the NHS Gender Identity Clinic’s accept a large number of referrals onto their waiting list each year. Additionally, given the high prevalence of a history NSSI and suicidality within the trans population (McNeil et al., 2017), it is not anticipated that application of the inclusion criteria will significantly limit the number of potential participants. There are currently 531 individuals on the waiting list for GGC Sandyford (as of 18/01/2019) and the service accepts approximately 30 new adult referrals each month. The proposed sample size represents only 0.75% to 1.88% of the potential participant pool prior to inclusion/exclusion criteria.   3.5 Recruitment Procedures Participants will be recruited from two Gender Identity Clinics within NHS Scotland; the Sandyford Centre (NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde; GGC) and the Chalmers Centre (NHS Lothian). Potential participants will be identified from the adult service at these clinics during a number of points of contact; initial waiting list, initial assessment, and internal waiting list for medical review. Gender Identity Clinics are not considered mental health services; however they provide support to any person who feels uncomfortable or uncertain about their gender identity or expression of their gender. Their primary role is to assist transgender people to facilitate social, medical and surgical  182  treatments that enable greater comfort in the face of gender non-conformity. Both clinics accept referrals from other health professionals (e.g. GP), whilst GGC Sandyford centre also self-referrals. Prior consent to be contacted for research purposes is sought at the point of self-referral and at initial appointment. Anyone who has not provided consent to be contacted for research purposes (at initial appointment or at time of self-referral) will be omitted from any invites. The clinics provide a national service to any individuals registered with a GP in Scotland.  Individuals on the waiting list for initial partnership appointment are not considered GGC/Lothian patients unless they are registered at a GP within these health board areas. Once individuals are open to the gender identity clinic following initial contact, they are then considered NHS GGC/Lothian patients (dependent on location).  A number of recruitment strategies will be employed to increase the likelihood that the required number of participants will be recruited. These are summarised below  Recruitment strategy one: Following initial assessment, individuals are then placed on an internal waiting list for medical review. Individuals who are on the waiting list for medical review and have provided consent to be contacted for research purposes will be sent information pertaining to the study (e.g. inclusion criteria, purpose of study), and invited to participate.  Recruitment strategy two: Clinical staff will be provided with information regarding the study, including inclusion/exclusion criteria. Clinical staff conducting initial assessments will be asked to introduce the study and provide study information packs to individuals who have indicated that they would like to be contacted for research purposes and who may meet inclusion criteria for the study.  Recruitment strategy three: Individuals who have self-referred and have provided consent to be contacted for research purposes will be sent information pertaining to the study (e.g. inclusion criteria, purpose of study), and invited to participate. NHS Lothian does not accept self-referrals and so recruitment strategy three will only be employed at NHS GG&C Sandyford Centre.  Only individuals who are registered with GP in Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board Area will be identified from the partnership waiting list.  After receiving an information pack, potential participants will be asked to provide consent for the researcher to contact them should they wish to take part, either by returning the enclosed consent form or by emailing written consent to the researcher. They will then be contacted directly by telephone by the researcher (following a period of at least 24 hours) who will provide any further information that is required and arrange a time for interview at the convenience of participants. A formal assessment of suicidal risk will be administered by the researcher prior to/following each interview. This standardised risk screening protocol is extensively used by the Suicidal Research Behaviour Laboratory (see Appendix 1). Additionally, the researcher (Lisa Ballantyne) is a final year Trainee Clinical Psychologist with experience in conducting formal risk assessments, including suicide risk, within clinical mental health settings. The research has also undertaken a number of additional training courses aimed at suicide awareness, risk assessment, and prevention (e.g. ASSIST Training, STORM training, FACE CARAS). Any individual identified as at imminent risk of suicide at any stage of the interview will be referred immediately to the appropriate Crisis Service.  3.6 Setting and Equipment  183  All interviews will be conducted in a clinical setting within Sandyford Central (Glasgow) or Chalmers Centre (Edinburgh). A recorder, transcription kit, and laptop will be borrowed from The University of Glasgow  3.7 Methodology Interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed before being analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) guided by Smith, Flowers and Larkin (2009). IPA is a qualitative approach which explores the processes whereby individuals make sense of their subjective lived experiences. IPA relies on an inductive approach which invites individuals, viewed as experts of their own experiences, to share their accounts of a given phenomenon. Participants are afforded the opportunity to reflect on their own experiences and express their ideas, whilst sharing their detailed first-hand stories with the researcher during interview (Smith et al. 2009).   3.8 Qualitative Interviews One-on-one semi-structured interviews, lasting approximately one hour, will be conducted by the primary researcher. An interview schedule will be used to help structure these interviews, although this will be a limited guide and will not be followed rigidly. Instead, this guide will support participants to reflect on the experiences which they deem central to the given topic, in line with IPA’s inductive stance.   3.9 Data Analysis  Each participant’s data (e.g. claims, concerns and understandings) will be analysed line by line through transcription and coding. Emergent themes will then be identified, focusing convergence and divergence, commonality and nuance. This interpretation will be a dialogue between the researcher, the coded data, and their knowledge, when considering what it might mean for participants to have these concerns, in this context. A structure will then be developed to demonstrate the relationships between themes, before then forming a more cohesive narrative. The coherence and plausibility of themes will be tested through the use of supervision.  3.10 Data Management Plan Personal data will be recorded on consent forms which will be stored in a locked filing cabinet at the University of Glasgow. Each consent form (with personal identifiable information) will be given a unique code. Each interview will audio recording will be stored on an encrypted USB stick provided by the University of Glasgow. Only the researcher (Lisa Ballantyne) will have access to these audio files. Recordings will be backed up on a password protected part of the University network and will be destroyed at the end of the study. Each recording will be transcribed verbatim and all identifiable information will be removed to preserve the anonymity of participants and pseudonyms will be applied. A unique code for each participant will be noted on the anonymised data, which will link to identifiable information held separately. Recordings and transcripts will be treated in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations (2018) and NHS Confidentiality Code of Practice on Protecting Patient Confidentiality (2002). The University of Glasgow will retain personal data for between 12 months and 3 years due to the typical time required for publication exceeding 12 months. Research data generated by the study will be stored for 10 years. The research data will be stored in a locked filing cabinet at the premises of the Institute of Health & Well-being at Gartnavel Royal Hospital.  4. Health and Safety The researcher will receive regular supervision by the local clinical supervisor. All interviews will take place on NHS clinical grounds and the appropriate local health and safety guidelines will be followed, thus reducing the risk to both researcher and participants. Participant safety issues are discussed in further detail below in section 5 (ethical issues).  184   5. Ethics Prior to commencing research, ethical approval will be requested from the West of Scotland Research Committee and the Sandyford Research Governance Group (RGG).   5.1 Informed Consent The voluntary and confidential nature of participation will be made explicit. Participants will be assured that they can withdraw their participation at any time. Written consent will be obtained prior to interview.   5.2 Risk of Coercion Information provided (information sheet/verbal discussions) will stress that participation is voluntary and the decision to participate or not will not affect their care.   5.3 Data Protection and Confidentiality Participants will also be assured that their data will be anonymised and will remain confidential and limits of confidentiality will be explained. Pseudonyms will be used for the duration of the interview and during analysis.   5.4 Potential Distress The potentially sensitive topic will be acknowledged and participants will be advised that they are not required to answer any questions they do not wish to. In the unlikely event that a participant does become distressed, they will be encouraged to discuss any issues with their GP. A field supervisor will available while the interviews are taking place should immediate support be required. Participants will be provided with a list of contacts for further local/ culturally inclusive support. As noted, a risk screening tool will be used at the start and end of every interview to ascertain risk of suicide specifically. An action plan will be in place should any participant disclose information suggesting that they may be at imminent risk.   5.5 Transgender Health Research Adams, Pearce, Veale et al. (2017) highlighted further ethical considerations needed for transgender health research, including the potential for distressed caused by misgendering individuals or by using stigmatising language. The language and procedures used will be guided by collaboration with local trans groups (e.g. Scottish Trans Alliance).   6. Finance The University of Glasgow will fund the costs involved in printing, photocopying, and posting of the research information packs.  7. Proposed Timetable January 2019:     Proposal submission April-October 2019:    Ethics November-January 2019:  Data collection February 2019:    Review point February-March 2020:   Data Coding/analysis April-July 2020:    Write-up/Submission  8. Practical Applications Identification of factors which increase or decrease NSSI and suicidality for transgender people will in turn aid risk management and inform clinical interventions. Given the importance of help-seeking behaviours in preventing suicide, identification of factors which influence these behaviours within  185  the transgender population may provide important considerations for both policy and service development.   The results of this study will be submitted as a piece of work for a doctoral qualification in Clinical Psychology. The results may also be published in academic journals, conference proceedings and a summary of results will be made available to participants who would like feedback about the research once completed.    9.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Transgender individuals are substantially more likely to report self-harm and suicidality than both cisgender individuals and other LGBT individuals. The psychosocial factors underlying self-harm and suicidality within the trans population, and how they may lead to suicidal ideation or attempts, remain largely under-researched. Protective factors, such as resilience and help-seeking may help to reduce risk of suicide within the trans population, however further research is required to examine these processes. Similarly, exploring trans-specific experiences of help-seeking for suicidal distress is important when considering suicide prevention. Further empirical research, aimed at improving our understanding and prevention of suicide within this population, is imperative.\n\n\n\nMethod:  A qualitative design was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with transgender adults (n=4) in Scotland, who reported a history of self-harm and/or suicidality. Interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).\n\n\n\nResults: Four superordinate themes emerged, each with inter-related subordinate themes. 1) “Early Experiences”: How individuals made sense of early experiences which increased their self-harm and suicidal distress. 2) “Intent”: The motives underlying participants’ self-harm and suicidality. 3) “Hope and Resilience”: The protective resilience factors that reduced participants’ self-harm and suicidal distress. 4) “Threats to Resilience”: How participants made sense of additional minority stressors that were relevant to their experiences.\n\n\n\nConclusion: The current study suggests that transgender individuals may experience psychosocial factors related to self-harm and suicidality differently across various stages of their lives. Important insights into the motivations underlying self-harm and suicidality for transgender individuals emerged. Clinical implications are discussed, however further research is required to fully understand self-harm and suicidality within the transgender community",
