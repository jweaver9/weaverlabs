We find that relativeto married heterosexual men, homosexual men earn less and anti-discriminatory laws,over time, partially lessen this gap. This gap is statistically non-existent relative to un-married heterosexual men. Homosexual women, on the other hand, experience higherearnings than their heterosexual female counterparts, and the law shrinks this gap overtime. Our results suggest that although the earnings differential may be due to themarriage premium, anti-discriminatory laws do help reduce labor market differencesbetween homosexuals and heterosexuals. We conjecture that allowing homosexuals tomarry could reduce the earnings inequality without creating potentially significant la-bor market distortions.JEL Classification: J12, J16, J70, J78Keywords: Earnings, Employment, Sexual Orientation, Policy∗The authors would like to thank Marieka Klawitter for providing data on local anti-discriminatory laws.Earning Differences Between Homosexuals and Heterosexuals and the Effectsof Anti-Discriminatory Laws: Equal but Still Unmarried1 IntroductionGay and lesbian rights advocates have pursued passage of legislation that explicitly prohibitsworkplace discrimination based on sexual orientation since the 1970s (Rimmerman et al., eds,2000). They do so on the grounds that this group is the target of discriminatory practiceswith respect to wages and employment outcomes. Indeed, several studies have found evidencethat on average, homosexual men do earn lower wages than their heterosexual counterparts,presumably in part due to labor discrimination. While this result has not been found withrespect to homosexual women, popular support for laws protecting homosexuals remains.1These anti-discriminatory laws have the potential to affect the estimated 4 million gays andlesbians currently residing in the United States (Gates, 2011); consequently, the effect ofthese laws is of notable importance.Currently the efforts of advocates have resulted in significant successes at the state andlocal level, but a federal anti-discriminatory law remains elusive.2 Twenty-one states andthe District of Columbia prohibit labor market discrimination against gays and lesbians byprivately owned companies (HRC, 2009). Additionally, many localities, cities, and in somecases counties have independently passed their own version of the law.3 Similar to racial,gender and disability anti-discrimination provisions, these laws attempt to establish equalaccess and opportunity to employment to those with different sexual orientations. Researchon the effect of these laws has not provided conclusive results regarding the impact it has onthe group in question (Acemoglu and Angrist, 2001; Collins, 2003; Beegle and Stock, 2003).1See Klawitter (2011) for a comprehensive overview.2There is currently a proposed bill, “The Employment Non Discrimination Act”, being considered in theU.S. Congress which would legally prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation at the federallevel.3Data gathered from Klawitter (2011) estimate that in 2010 approximately 195 localities protect gaysand lesbians from labor market discrimination at private and state agencies, while 137 do so for governmententities only.1In this paper we consider the issue of labor market discrimination against gays and les-bians and examine the effect of state-wide anti-discriminatory laws. Recent studies usingCensus data compare the wages of gays and lesbians to their married heterosexual coun-terparts and the difference in wages is interpreted as evidence of discrimination.4 However,previous findings by Allegretto and Arthur (2001) revealed that the presence of a wage gapbetween homosexual and heterosexual men is partly explained by a marriage premium. Ourup-to-date data confirm that the earnings of homosexual men are not statistically differentfrom those of cohabitating unmarried heterosexual men, but are different from the earningsof heterosexual married men.The presence of a strong marriage premium highlights the potentially significant socialand economics distortionary effects of the Defense of Marriage Act, suggesting reexaminationand reevaluation of the current approach to deal with discrimination based on sexual orien-tation.5 To date, most U.S. states trying to correct for this type of discrimination have optedto implement anti-discrimination laws covering a wide range of subjects, including housing,accommodation, and wages. We analyze the effect of anti-discriminatory laws on relativeearnings using a difference-in-difference-in-difference approach (DDD). This approach allowsus to capture the relative differences in earnings in states that have passed a law comparedto states that have not. This method has well regarded advantages when considering theanalysis of the effect of a law on particular groups. Most importantly, it allows us to controlfor the established differences in earnings differentials of homosexuals and heterosexuals thatexist between states over time, independent of any law that was passed. If, for example, astate that had a relatively high wage gap adopted the law and the earnings differential be-tween homosexuals and heterosexuals decreased, but not to the level of states that did not4Our data also comes from the Decennial Census. The Census allows individuals to classify their rela-tionship to head of household as an unmarried partner. Using this information, sexual orientation is inferredfrom the gender identification of both the head of household and the unmarried partner. In doing so, ourdata on gays and lesbians are limited to same-sex male and same-sex female couples. However, Black et al.(2007a) find that these couples are representative of the general gay and lesbian population.5The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) states that the federal government only recognizes marriages thatoccur between one man and one woman.2pass the law, a simple cross-sectional analysis would suggest that the law did not have anyimpact. A DDD approach is preferred because it controls for state specific time trends thatare independent of the passage of an anti-discriminatory law.To our knowledge, this is the first study to employ a DDD approach to analyze theeffect of anti-discriminatory laws on wages of homosexuals and heterosexuals.6 In additionto the methodological approach, our analysis differs from previous research with respect tothe classification of the data. Previous research links individuals’ earnings to their place ofresidence while we link wages to place of work. Even though most people work in the samestate where they reside, many live in either MSAs that cross state borders, or in bordercounties. This can result in a person residing in a state with no law, but working in astate with one, affecting the estimated law impacts. While the share of individuals workingin a state different from the one where they reside is small, and may not yield significantdifferences, we believe that this adjustment is still important in terms of precision. Also,since we follow Klawitter (2011) in allowing for the influence of laws passed at the localcity level, these adjustments seem pertinent given the degree of inter-city commuting in theUnited States.The results of our analysis suggest that when we control for labor market trends ineach state, anti-discrimination laws do have an effect on wages as time since passage of thelaw increases. Yet, we do not find evidence of any contemporaneous statistical differencebetween the relative earnings of homosexuals that work in a state with a law and thosethat work in a state without one. We also find little evidence of an impact of the law onemployment of those in same-sex relationships, both at the intensive and extensive margins.Furthermore, the effect of the law through time appears to also affect heterosexual men and6Beegle and Stock (2003) used this approach to analyze the effect of disability laws. The DDD method-ology is possible given that the Census now allows for the identification of households with same-sex couplesfor a number of years. Our estimates rely on IPUMS micro data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Censuses andthe 2009 American Community Survey (ACS). For computational ease, and in order to match the densityof the ACS sample (1 percent), the Census data extracts are re-weighted samples from the 5 percent sampleof the United States population. This allows us to exploit the timing of the state and local laws passed overa period of almost two decades.3women, potentially and unintendedly helping to close the overall gap created by the marriagepremium.In section 2 we provide a general background and summarize the previous literature. Insection 2 we also discuss the theory and previous empirical findings. Section 3 describes thedata and the empirical method. In section 4 we present the results, and in section 5 weconclude.2 Background2.1 On Labor Market DiscriminationExtensive research exists on the differences in employment outcomes between homosexualsand heterosexuals. Although the research has found wage differentials between these groups,it has not been able to provide conclusive evidence for or against the existence of discrimi-nation. In general, studies using various types of survey data have found that homosexualmen tend to earn lower wages than their heterosexual counterparts (Badgett, 1995; Klawitterand Flatt, 1998; Clain and Leppel, 2001; Berg and Lien, 2002; Black et al., 2003; Blanford,2003; Plugg and Berkhout, 2004; Frank, 2006; Carpenter, 2007; Elmslie and Tebaldi, 2007;Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 2010). In contrast to the findings for men, similar studies donefor women only have found that homosexual females typically earn the same or more thantheir heterosexual counterparts (Klawitter and Flatt, 1998; Clain and Leppel, 2001; Bergand Lien, 2002; Black et al., 2003; Blanford, 2003; Plugg and Berkhout, 2004; Arabsheibaniet al., 2005; Elmslie and Tebaldi, 2007; Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 2010), although Badgett(1995); Carpenter (2004) did find that lesbians earn less than heterosexual women.77Black et al. (2007b) show descriptive statistics using Census data for 2000 that supports the idea that gaymen earn less than their heterosexual counterparts (married or unmarried). Similarly, they show that lesbianwomen earn more than their heterosexual counterparts (married or unmarried). Their analysis, however,pools married and unmarried heterosexuals into one group, while we separately compare each group to gaysand lesbians. Allegretto and Arthur (2001) use data from the 1990 Census only, and find that unmarriedheterosexual men still enjoy slightly higher earnings than men in same-sex relationships.4Perceived discrimination in the labor market is also well documented in the literature.Most recently, Tilcsik (2011) experiments using fictitious resumes that highlight previousparticipation in a gay campus organization in the U.S., and finds that openly gay men receiveless calls from potential employers. Herek (2009) uses survey responses from a nationallyrepresentative sample of gays and lesbians to determine if they are the victims of various typesof discrimination. He finds that one in ten surveyed have experienced discrimination in thehousing or labor market. Previously Badgett et al. (2007) provided a comprehensive overviewof many of the surveys that have been conducted of homosexuals regarding discrimination.In their analysis they find that in studies from the mid-1980’s to mid-1990’s, 16% to 68%of gay, lesbian, and bisexual respondents reported experiencing employment discriminationat some point in their lives, while in the 15 studies conducted since the mid-1990’s 15% to43% of respondents reported experiencing discrimination in the workplace.Despite evidence of perceived discrimination from survey data analysis, the documentedearnings differentials between gays or lesbians and their heterosexual counterparts cannotbe taken as conclusive proof of actual discrimination. Becker (1971) developed a householdspecialization model which predicts that in heterosexual relationships females invest in ob-taining fewer labor market skills as they expect to be coupled with a high earning male inthe future, while men tend to invest in more labor market skills because of their belief inbeing coupled with a low earning female in the future.8Applying this model to same-sex relationships would predict that gays invest in obtainingless labor market skills relative to a heterosexual male (since they plan on being partneredwith a male in the future), while lesbians invest in obtaining more labor market skills thanheterosexual females (since they plan on being partnered with a female in the future).9To the extent that these decisions are unobservable, they may be driving the observed8In the presence of potential discrimination, Becker (1971) predicts that market forces will eliminate wagedifferentials due to discriminatory practices. His model predicts that discriminatory firms will be driven outof the industry since non-discriminatory ones will benefit in terms of increased profits. However, Rose´n(2003) argues that this prediction does not hold under markets with friction and wage bargaining.9See also Becker (1991) for more on household specialization.5earnings differences often found in the literature. Therefore, lower earnings for homosexualmales cannot be considered definitive evidence of discrimination against gays, while thehigher earnings enjoyed by homosexual females cannot be considered definitive evidencethat lesbians are not discriminated against.Black et al. (2007b) considers this hypothesis by examining the choice of college majorof heterosexuals and homosexuals. They combine Census data for individuals in same-sexrelationships with data from the National Survey of College Graduates and statistically showthat homosexual men are more likely to graduate with a “typically female major” relativeto heterosexual men. The opposite is true for homosexual women. Under the assumptionthat “typically male” majors yield higher returns, that suggests that wage differentials canbe partly explained by education choice, rather than actual discrimination. 10In an attempt to overcome these difficulties, some researchers have employed labor marketexperiments to test for the presence of discrimination. Weichselbaumer (2003) conducted anational Swedish experiment in the hiring process, randomly assigning sexual orientation todifferent job applicants. She finds that gays experience discrimination in male-dominatedindustries and lesbians experience discrimination in female-dominated industries. Drydakis(2011) follows a similar procedure for a United States based experiment for gays, signalingsexual orientation through participation in a gay organization appearing on the resume.He also finds evidence for discrimination against gay men. However, these results concernopenly gay men who may be different in unobserved ways from the general gay population.Both experiments test for discrimination in the hiring process rather than wages or earnings.11 These results have, in part, motivated the adoption of anti-discriminatory laws and it isuseful to analyze whether these laws did have the outcome intended.10See Brown and Corcoran (1997) for detailed descriptions of “typical female/male majors.”11Note that in this analysis, like in some others looking at the differences in earnings, we employ Censusdata rather than survey data to allow for a more nuanced approach.62.2 On the History of Anti-Discriminatory LawsAlthough establishing the existence of discrimination against gays and lesbians is compli-cated, the perception of discrimination has motivated law makers to adopt anti-discriminatorylegislation on the basis of sexual orientation. There is not currently a federal anti-discriminatorylaw but a few states have had such legislation in place for decades. In 1975, Pennsylvaniaadopted a law that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation at all stateagencies. Wisconsin was the first state to implement a law that covered the private sector in1982 (although the District of Columbia adopted a law that covered employment in the pri-vate sector in 1973). By 1990, the first year in our sample, only Wisconsin and Massachusetts(1989) had adopted a law that applied to all private companies.Table 1 summarizes the development of the state laws adopted to date. We are particu-larly interested in laws that cover employment in the private sector. As table 1 shows, thereare some states in which discrimination is explicitly prohibited in state agencies, but not inprivate companies. In other states, neither state nor private employers are required by thelaw to provide equal opportunities to those with different sexual preferences. Additionally,state provisions differ from each other in regard to the inclusion of gender identity. Forexample, the Maryland Annexed Code art. 49B §5 of 2001 does prohibit discrimination onthe basis of sexual orientation but does not explicitly address the issue of gender identity(e.g. transgender).[INSERT TABLE 1 HERE]These state laws have largely been designed after other stipulations that prohibit em-ployment discrimination based on race, gender, and to some extent disability (Klawitter,2011). In California, for instance, the term ‘sexual orientation’ was added to a broaderlegislation that includes race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical andmental disability, medical condition, marital status, sex, and age. It explicitly prohibitsdiscrimination in hiring, firing, compensation package, and employment conditions. It pro-hibits discrimination against the participation in labor organizations such as unions or other7training programs, and also forbids sexual harassment. Many of these laws are not limited toemployment and also include housing and other public accommodations. Interestingly, theequal employment opportunity self-identification form does not include a category for sexualorientation. This implies that the identification of homosexuals in the workplace dependson their degree of openness, either by word or behavior. In many cases, independently ofwhether there exists a law or not, individuals may be reluctant to reveal their sexual orien-tation for personal reasons unrelated to the workplace. This in turn may have consequencesfor the analysis of such laws that are discussed below.2.3 On the Theoretical Effects of Anti-Discriminatory LawsLogic dictates that anti-discrimination laws should help dissipate the differences in employ-ment outcomes due to discriminatory behavior. For the case of race and sex, this has beenpartly true. The laws have reduced earning gaps, but not eliminated them.12 However, the-ory suggests that the effects may not be straightforward. Similar to Beegle and Stock (2003),we consider the theoretical model laid out by Acemoglu and Angrist (2001) and apply it togays and lesbians in particular. Due to the similarities, and for brevity, we summarize thepredictions without presenting the mathematical derivations of the model. In general, themodel predicts that employment outcomes for gays and lesbians are affected by the passageof anti-discrimination laws through two main channels.The first channel of effect occurs because the passage of the law allows individuals to suethe employer over the belief that failure to hire (or fire for those already employed) was due totheir sexual orientation. This increases the firms’ costs by adding the risk of potentially goingto court over such a lawsuit. The higher the potential cost to the firm, the higher probabilityof a member of that group being hired (or not fired). However, the cost of not hiring and/orfiring homosexuals may not be the same, yielding ambiguous predictions for the demandof homosexual workers. Indeed, the costs in either case depend on the firm’s perceived12See Klawitter (2011) for a discussion of studies.8probabilities of potential lawsuits over not hiring or firing a homosexual. Conditional onthe probability of firms being sued on discrimination grounds, they will weigh the relativeprobabilities of a lawsuit. If the expected probability of a lawsuit for firing homosexuals isgreater than the expected probability of a lawsuit from not hiring homosexuals, firms willchoose to decrease the demand for homosexuals. On the other hand, if the fear (or risk)from lawsuits stemming from not hiring homosexuals is bigger than that for firing themonce they are employees, the overall demand for this group will increase. Rubenstein (2001)finds that population adjusted complaint rates based on sexual orientation discriminationare similar to the population adjusted complaint rates based on race and gender differences.Rubenstein (2001) provides evidence that firms have a reason to fear a costly lawsuit fromgays and lesbians and that law has an impact on firms hiring decisions. Yet, there exists noconclusive evidence on which probability of lawsuit is higher.The second channel of effect acts through an equal pay provision that is typically includedin anti-discriminatory laws. The equal pay provision aims at reducing wage inequalitiesbetween homosexual workers and heterosexual workers. Homosexuals might receive lowerwages for various reasons. Some employers might have a “taste for discriminating” againstminority groups, implying that firms with such taste will hire a homosexual only at a lowerwage than a heterosexual worker with similar characteristics (Black, 1995). It also might bethe case that the taste for discrimination simply reduces the demand for homosexuals, relativeto heterosexuals, driving down wages. Another possibility is that there exist systematicunobserved productivity differences between homosexuals and heterosexuals which explainthe earnings gap. However, it is likely that other than sexual orientation, homosexualsare not systematically different from heterosexuals on average. Thus, in the presence ofan employer’s distaste for homosexuals, we expect to observe a lower wage for homosexualworkers relative to the equilibrium wage for heterosexual workers.13 This implies that at13Note that distaste for homosexuality could also come from other employees. If other workers feel uncom-fortable working around homosexuals, work morale and productivity may be affected. As a result, employersmay choose not to hire homosexuals, or simply hire them at reduced wages to offset the loss of other workers’productivity.9the equilibrium point, an equal pay provision will act as a price floor in the market forhomosexual workers, raising the wage but reducing net employment.Given these two effects, the passage of the anti-discrimination law may result in severaldifferent employment outcomes for gays and lesbians. Keeping supply constant, we wouldexpect wages to increase through an increase in demand if the probability of law suits fromfailure to hire is greater than the probability of law suits for firing a homosexual. This iscommonly interpreted as a “hiring subsidy”. The opposite occurs if the probability of alawsuit from firing a homosexual is relatively higher (a “hiring cost”). In the presence ofan equal pay provision, if the hiring subsidy dominates but wages are still less than thosefor the heterosexual counterparts, then wages increase further. The overall effect of the lawin this case is an increase in wages. The effect on employment is ambiguous given thatthe increase that arises from increased demand is offset by decreases in quantity demandedfrom the equal pay provision. On the other hand, if wages for homosexuals are indeedlower than those for heterosexual and ‘hiring costs’ do indeed decrease demand, then netemployment decreases further (both through in equilibrium and due to the price floor). Yet,the overall wages of homosexuals increase from the equal pay provision. Even if there is noevidence of wage disparities, often interpreted as discrimination, we should expect to observechanges in wages, or employment, or both, due to the possibility of lawsuits resulting fromthe implementation of the law. For instance, if the fear/risk of lawsuits from not hiringhomosexuals is smaller than that of firing them, one should expect a downward shift in thedemand for homosexuals, lowering equilibrium wages and employment. However, the equalpay provision would keep wages at the initial level, but decrease employment even further.2.4 On the Empirical Findings of Anti-Discriminatory LegislationBased on Sexual OrientationTo our knowledge there have been three previous papers using data from the 1990 and 2000U.S. Census to analyze the effect of state anti-discrimination laws on gay and lesbian labor10market outcomes. Klawitter and Flatt (1998) collect data on both state and local publicand and private employment laws and find no evidence that the existence of these laws hasan effect on the wages of gays or lesbians. However, this study was performed using 1990data and most of the anti-discrimination laws that were in place at that time had only beenaround for a short time period. Therefore, the insignificant effects of the laws may havebeen due to the laws not having a long enough time to be fully implemented and theireffects to be observable. Gates (2009) performs a similar analysis using data from the 2000U.S. Census, but only uses state laws because they allow for an exact geographic match ofsame-sex couples and state-level policies provide a more consistent standard of applicationand enforcement than local laws.Gates (2009) finds that the presence of an anti-discrimination law increases the relativeearnings of gays by 3.0% and by 0.3% for each year the law is in effect. For lesbians, he findsan increase in relative earnings of lesbians of 2.0% in states with an anti-discrimination lawand an increase of 0.3% for each year the law is an effect. More recently, Klawitter (2011)also uses 2000 U.S. Census data but includes local as well as state laws. She employs a multi-level cross-sectional approach and finds evidence that anti-discrimination laws decrease theearnings penalty of gay men, primarily by increasing hours worked per week, but findsno evidence that anti-discrimination laws are associated with differences in the earnings oflesbians.Our paper differs from these previous studies of sexual orientation anti-discriminationlaws in three ways. First, we identify the potential impact of a law based on the place ofwork rather than the place of residence. Second we use a difference-in-difference-in-differenceapproach to account for trends in local labor markets. We extend the work of Gates (2009)by also including laws adopted at the local level. Unlike Klawitter (2011), however, in ourestimation we use local laws indicators only when state laws have not been adopted. Asin Gates (2009), we assume that once a state-wide law is passed, individuals will be morelikely to use state courts, rather than the local government, in case of a legal dispute. This11is partly reaffirmed by Klawitter (2011), as she finds no strong evidence of labor marketeffects in places with both laws. Finally, our analysis follows ? by using two separateestimations. One measuring the differences between individuals in same-sex couples withrespect to married heterosexuals, and another with respect to unmarried heterosexual.All three of these studies use a pooled sample composed of married heterosexuals, un-married cohabitating heterosexuals, and same-sex cohabitating couples. Since married andunmarried heterosexuals may differ from individuals in same-sex couples in different ways,we prefer estimating them separately, allowing us to take full advantage of the difference-in-difference-in-difference approach. Theoretically, the treatment and the control or referencegroup should only differ in that one is subject to the law, while the other is not. Due tosome of the social constraints encountered by homosexual couples in the United States, itis not obvious who should be chosen as the correct control group: married or unmarriedheterosexuals. Hence, we find it necessary to estimate the effect of the law with respect toboth groups separately.143 Empirical Approach3.1 Difference-in-Difference-in-DifferenceRecent studies which analyze the effect of race and gender anti-discriminatory laws haveestimated regressions with pooled data from different time periods using the difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) methodology. Neumark and Stock (2001) employs the DDDmethodology to analyze the effect of the passage of sex and race anti-discrimination laws atthe state level. They find that race anti-discrimination laws generally increase the relativeearnings and employment of blacks and that gender anti-discrimination laws increase relative14Allegretto and Arthur (2001) also adopt this approach in their analysis of earnings differentials, findingthat the difference between homosexual and heterosexual men lies between an upper and a lower bound thatis determined by the estimates using the two reference groups separately. Their difference is partly explainedby the marriage premium.12earnings and decrease relative employment for women. Collins (2003) applies a similar DDDframework to study the effect of race anti-discrimination laws and also finds, at least for the1940’s, that the passage of race anti-discrimination laws improved labor market outcomesfor blacks. The DDD methodology is also used by Beegle and Stock (2003) to analyze theimpact that the passage of disability anti-discrimination laws at the state level have on wages,employment, and labor market participation of the disabled. Their findings suggest thatdisability anti-discrimination laws generally lead to lower relative earnings and lower relativelabor force participation for the disabled without influencing their relative employment.The difference-in-difference-in-difference approach allows us to to identify the net effectof the laws on the employment outcomes for individuals in same-sex relationships. We followBeegle and Stock (2003) in controlling for differences in employment outcomes across statesand time. We allow for interactions between state and year, controlling for differences inemployment outcomes across states for each specific year. Additional interactions includethose between time and state with an indicator for homosexual. This controls for the presenceof individual shocks in the labor market for homosexuals in different states, as well as theirtime trends. However, using these interactions precludes us from estimating the coefficienton the general effect of the law across all observations, given the generation of a commonintercept for all individuals in a state and year. The model is characterized as followsYist =α + (SLst ∗ SSist)ϕ+ SSistγ + (SSist ∗ States)δs + (SSist ∗ Y eart)δt (1)+ Statesηs + Y eartηt + (States ∗ Y eart)ηst +Xistβ + LListρ+ (LList ∗ SSist)θ +Durationstϕ+ (Durationst ∗ SSist)ς + εistwhere Yist is the employment outcome of interest for an individual i in state s and Censusyear t. The vector denoted by X includes information about race, gender, age, age squared,a dummy to indicate if the person lives with children, dummies for educational attaintment,disability status, English proficiency, urban or rural residency, non-earned income, and aver-13age work hours per week. SL corresponds to a binary indicator for the existence of the lawin a state in a given year, and SS is an indicator defining whether the person is part of asame-sex relationship. Similarly, LL identifies if the individual lives in a city or town wherethere exists an anti-discrimination law in that particular year, but no law has been passedat the state level. Finally, Duration measures the time since the state law has been passedat the time of measurement.Previous studies have reported results for subsets of the population (Gates, 2009; Klawit-ter, 2011). Beegle and Stock (2003), for instance, estimate the impact of disability laws forgroups characterized by age, race, and sex. The purpose of dividing the sample is to ac-count for the passage of other anti-discrimination laws. Like most studies of homosexuals,we are able to estimate the model for men and women separately but not for race or age.Our limitations come from the fact that we use state instead of regional dummies. Thecombination of state and year interactions, and the relative low number of observations insame-sex relationships when we cut the sample into smaller subgroups presents problems ofperfect predictability and collinearity. As such, the best we can do is to control for thesecharacteristics in the main regression.The data and specification do allow us to estimate the results using two subgroups. Dueto the living arrangements of the individuals selected in our sample, it is possible that evenunmarried partners make joint decisions in the labor market. Hence, we follow Klawitter(2011) by using a randomly selected person from each household.15It is recognized in the literature that the majority of laws are the result of predisposedconditions, namely political and economic. This implies that the passage of laws is notcompletely exogenous and quasi-experimental approaches like the difference-in-differencemethodology need to account for this possibility. Besley and Case (2000) propose two meth-15We also test our results using a subgroup of only those that identified themselves as heads of household.Restricting our sample to heads of household only serves as a means of checking for the robustness of theprevious results, but must be used carefully as heads of households in the census data is nothing but theperson who fills up the questionnaire. As such, it does not necessarily mean that it is the person with higherincome, or the person that specializes in labor-market-intensive activities.14ods. One is an instrumental variable approach where the laws can be instrumented withpolitical variables, and second is the use of a third difference adding a valid comparisongroup (making this a DDD approach). Though not a perfect solution, we opt for using theDDD and control for these preconditions by using state and year dummies. However, bychoosing a triple difference approach, we must choose an appropriate comparison group. Thischoice is complicated by the fact that homosexuals face social constraints not experiencedby heterosexuals.A valid control group must have the same characteristics as the treatment group exceptfor the access to the treatment. The census data allow us to restrict our sample to onlythose that are in committed relationships, whether by marriage or cohabitation. However,homosexual marriage is not recognized by the federal government so it is not clear whethermarried or cohabitating unmarried heterosexuals is the appropriate reference group.16 Aspointed out by Allegretto and Arthur (2001), using a subsample where heterosexual individu-als in married relationships are the control group, we implicitly assume that all homosexualswould get married if allowed to do so. The opposite assumption is made if unmarried butcohabitating heterosexuals are the control group. In the absence of a broad marriage recog-nition for gays and lesbians, it is unclear who would choose to be legally married. Thispresents challenges when studying both the difference in earnings as well as the effect ofanti-discriminatory laws.Since the earnings differentials can be partly due to the marriage premium, and themarriage premium could be partly explained by the signaling hypothesis, it is possible forthe law to unintendedly affect the non-treatment groups. Under the assumption that anontrivial portion of homosexuals may not be completely open about their orientation at themoment of hiring, it is plausible that the employer cannot distinguish between an unmarriedheterosexual and a homosexual. In this case, if employers fear the cost of lawsuits from not16Although a few states have ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in the last decade, some of the basicfederal benefits granted to married couples are still unavailable to these individuals, regardless of staterecognition.15hiring homosexuals, they may err on the side of caution, increasing the demand for bothhomosexuals and heterosexuals, which can in turn raise wages for both groups. Hence, thelaw could affect unmarried heterosexuals as well, while not the married ones. Yet, underbudget constraints and the fear of lawsuits due to unequal treatment, employers may alsoreduce the supply of married heterosexuals, with the law negatively affecting that group.We must note, however, that the marriage premium may exist because of specialization (i.e.human capital) or ability bias. Although we cannot resolve the issue of the ability bias,the census data do allow us to compare the occupations of homosexuals and heterosexuals,helping us narrow the similarities between individuals in same-sex couples and those inheterosexual marriages, as well as those in heterosexual cohabitation.Finally, as noted by Beegle and Stock (2003) and Bertrand et al. (2004), there is alsothe potential for serial correlation. Our specification controls for the time since the law wasadopted. Although this does not eliminate this concern, it does greatly reduce the problem.Additionally, we consider only three well spaced time periods. Following Beegle and Stock(2003), we argue that this further reduces the threat of serial correlation, which would persistif we used annual data from sources such as the American Community Survey (ACS). Asa practical matter, the passage of the laws can increase the incentive to self-identify as ahomosexual, leading to compositional bias. We are not overly concerned with this problemsince the data show that percent changes of self-identified homosexuals is small and verysimilar in states with and without laws.3.2 DataIn order to allow for sufficient time for the laws to be fully implemented, and avoid thepotential for serial correlation mentioned above, we use Census data in 10-year intervals.The data on gays and lesbians come from the 5% samples of the U.S. Census for 1990 and2000 and the 1% sample of the 2009 American Community Survey (Ruggles et al., 2009).1717This data is publicly available from www.ipums.org. At the point of measurement, data for the Census2010 was not publicly available, leading us to choose the ACS 2009 as the latest comparable sample. For16The Census Bureau does not ask individuals directly about their sexual orientation, butbeginning with the 1990 Census it has been possible to identify same-sex couples livingin cohabitation in the same household. This is inferred from the answer to “relationship tohousehold head” question on the Census.18 A major concern about this way of identifying gayand lesbian couples has been raised by Black et al. (2007a) and Gates and Steinberger (2010).Carpenter (2004) finds that most of these Census couples are indeed gays and lesbians.However, the Census also recoded those that appeared to be same-sex married couples assame-sex unmarried couples. However, Black et al. (2007a) find that many of these same-sexmarried couples are actually different-sex married couples that had misclassified themselves.We follow Gates and Steinberger (2010) suggestion of excluding same-sex couples for whichat least one of the members of the household had their marital status allocated by the Censusto correct for this misclassification.As mentioned above, we separately consider two comparison groups, married heterosexualindividuals and unmarried heterosexuals classified as part of a different-sex cohabitationarrangement. We follow the previous literature and divide each analysis into samples of onlymen and only women. Since we acknowledge that even in unmarried couples (homosexualor not) there might be some selectivity, we repeat the empirical analysis using a sample ofrandomly selected individuals within the couple.19Census data presents trade-offs that we acknowledge. While it only allows for the identi-fication of gays and lesbians that are in a committed relationship, it is the only national dataset that allows for the identification of their location. The samples selected for this analysisallow us to also identify the state and locality where the respondent resides and works. Weexploit this by only using individuals in committed relationships (homosexual or heterosex-computational ease, we extracted a re-weighted sample of 1% density for the years 1990 and 2000.18Gay and lesbian households are identified from the “relationship to household head” heading on theCensus. The categories under this heading are spouse, child, inlaw, unmarried partner, and other non-relative.19Even though the number of women in heterosexual couples that identified themselves as heads of house-holds is reduced, a sample using those identified as ‘heads of household’ is used as a robustness check whichyields consistent results.17ual), while being able to determine location. Also, while the majority of respondents workin the same state where they reside, there is a nontrivial number of respondents that work inanother state. We use place of work in order to increase precision. The Census also providesinformation on race, gender, disability status, education, and age, which are used as controlvariables.The data on state anti-discrimination laws are drawn from the Human Rights Campaign(HRC, 2009) and information for local laws is obtained from Klawitter (2011). Our indicatorfor the presence of a local law takes the value of one (1) only if a state law that prohibits dis-crimination on the basis of sexual orientation in all private companies has not been adoptedand implemented. This is done for every one of the three periods in the sample. In otherwords, workers in Los Angeles, CA are subject to the local law in 1990 but no longer in2000, since the state-wide law was adopted in 1992. We create this variable to control forthe fact that workers in Los Angeles had the opportunity to file complaints with the localauthorities in 1990, while others in other California towns could not. Local laws often covercities, counties, and other smaller towns. Using the Census, we are able to first allocatethose laws to workers in each specific city and county. Towns for which we cannot find amatch in the Census data, we follow Klawitter (2011) by using PUMAs, for which the lawcovers at least 40% of the PUMA.20The sample is restricted to include only those of working age (16 to 64 years of age), andchoosing subgroups depending upon the outcome of interest.21 We only analyze the earningsof those that are working “full time” for most of the year (i.e. 30 or more hours per weekand 27 or more weeks per year). Like in Beegle and Stock (2003), we do not account for theprobability that employed homosexuals are likely to be a selected group of workers, perhapswith better opportunities. These opportunities are not available in our data, and as such,20See Klawitter (2011) for the use of PUMAs for the allocation of local laws.21Most studies restrict the sample to exclude those of ages 16 and 17. Legally, these individuals areallowed to work, and we observe that a few identify themselves as living with a partner of the same sex.For comparability, we also restricted the sample to include only those between the ages of 18 and 64. Theresults are nearly identical and are available upon request.18our analysis estimates the effects of the law conditioned on being employed. Furthermore,the Census does not report wages. We use annual earnings and control for weeks workedduring the previous year, as well as the usual number of hours worked per week. Since weeksand hours worked are reported in ranges we use midpoints. We also exclude observationswith missing data and those with real hourly wages equivalent to $1.00 or less.Table 2 is a general description of the data. The share of individuals identifying them-selves as homosexual (i.e. in same-sex partnership) is measured as a percentage of totalnumber of couples, including both married and unmarried heterosexuals. When looking atthe number of same-sex couples as a percentage of all unmarried couples in the labor force,we find that this number oscillates between 2.5 (for 1990) and 8 percent (for 2009), indepen-dent of whether or not a law exists.22 Table 2 shows that there are slightly more same-sexcouples in states with a law in any given year, but the differences are not significant ant areusually less than 1 percent.[INSERT TABLE 2 HERE]Overall we do not observe major abnormalities in labor outcomes. Labor force participa-tion is slightly less for those that are married. It is likely that more individuals in this groupchoose to opt out of the labor force as part of the household decision. At the same time, thedata suggests that married persons are more likely to be employed given their participationin the labor force. Interestingly, the percentage of employed individuals in same-sex rela-tionships is higher than that of unmarried heterosexuals. This is true for all years whetherthey locate in a state with an anti-discrimination law or not. Additionally, the percentageof same-sex partners employed is higher in states with a law than in states without a law.Although this is also true for all years, the difference is consistently small, especially at alevel of employment around 95 percent.There are not noticeable differences in other employment outcomes such as weeks of22Our sample contains approximately 868,996 individuals in cohabitating couples in the labor force in1990, and 1,041,551 in 2009.19employment or earnings.23 Persons in same-sex relationships tend to be more educatedand more likely to live in metro areas. Additionally, those in same-sex relationships tendto be younger than married individuals, but older than persons in unmarried different-sexrelationships. This is of particular importance for determining the appropriate referencegroup. Theoretically, even though we control for these characteristics in the estimation, weshould should choose a control group that reflects similar ages, levels of education, location,and English proficiency. Yet, the statistics provided in table 2 use the the pooled sampleof men and women. We conduct similar analyses by gender, and run statistical tests forthe differences in proportions and means. Since the law may influence location as well asother personal decisions, we compare the means using the states that never passed the law.Although not reported, we find statistically different means and proportions for both marriedand homosexuals, and unmarried and heterosexuals. Yet, we find that for both men andwomen these differences are smaller between married individuals and homosexuals, providinga slight support for using married individuals as the control group.24 Further investigationprovides support for using married couples as controls, but this support is not particularlystrong.Employment success and earnings are not only determined by education, but also by oc-cupation. The census classifies each individual in our data set into one of 384 occupations.25We choose the occupations with highest concentration of men and women in same-sex rela-tionships and compare them to their married and unmarried counterparts. In Figure 1 wedisplay the occupations preferred by male and female homosexuals ranked from left to rightin the horizontal axis. The bars show the differences between the proportion of married andunmarried heterosexuals in those same occupations with respect to homosexuals. The figureshows no clear pattern. The difference between the proportion of male homosexuals and23Earnings, hours, and weeks worked are conditional on employment. Earnings are annual real earningsconditioned on “full-time” employment, given that the Census does not report wages.24These results are available from the authors upon request.25Due to the high number of occupations and the widespread distribution of individuals among those,the inclusion of occupation dummies in the empirical analysis becomes problematic due to problems ofcollinearity and perfect predictability.20married heterosexual men in management is smaller than that between homosexuals andunmarried heterosexuals, but this is not true for sales, managers of food service, or wait-ers/waitresses. For the case of men, there is a slight support for having smaller differenceswith married heterosexuals, but the pattern is less clear for case of women. The lack ofcertainty leads us to present results using both married and unmarried as separate controlgroups.[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]4 ResultsTable 3 shows the results obtained from the initial difference-in-difference-in-difference es-timation. Most of the coefficients have the expected sign and significance. While Blacket al. (2007b) suggest that college major may be important in explaining wage differences,calling for the need to control for area of study, we do not have data on major. The Censusdoes identify industry, but there may be many occupations within an industry. Control-ling for occupation presents problems of perfect predictability given the wide distribution ofhomosexuals in all 384 occupations across each state.We analyze men, women, married, and unmarried separately. Since we do not observewages, we follow previous studies that utilize Census data and use real earnings per yearfor those that work full-time for most of the year. Klawitter (2011) found that men thatare part of same-sex and different sex unmarried couples earned less than married men. Asexpected we find that men in same-sex relationships earn less than married men. We confirmprior results finding no statistical difference when we compare men in same-sex couples tocoupled-unmarried heterosexual men. Although determining the correct comparison groupis difficult, our results confirm that a large part of the difference in annual earnings found inprevious studies of homosexual men may be due to the marriage premium.[INSERT TABLE 3 HERE]21Specific for the purpose of our study, we find that, at a given point in time, men insame-sex partnerships working in states that have passed the anti-discrimination laws arenot better off than their counterparts in states without laws. The law, however, does tendto increase the relative earnings of homosexual men over time, as shown by the coefficientof Time Passed*SS in Table 3. Table 4 provides a comprehensive summary of the results.To account for the possibility of household specialization, we also estimate the model usinga restricted sample of one individual in a same-sex partnership rather than both. Thepartner chosen is randomly selected to ensure a mixture of individuals designated as head ofhousehold and those designated as the partner.Table 4 also highlights the time and state interactions used in all estimations.26 Onaverage, an additional year the law is in effect increases the relative wages of men in same-sex relationships by approximately 0.50 to 0.85 percent. While the effect of the law onthe target group is consistent regardless of the comparison group, we find that the law alsoinfluences the earnings of heterosexuals. Results in the first two columns (using married menas the control group) show that all men in general earn less in states where the law has beenin place longer. This is the opposite of what we find when we use unmarried heterosexualmen as a comparison group (columns 3 and 4). It may be that the law affects wages not onlyby increasing the wages of homosexual men, but also by decreasing those of married men.Since the percent of homosexual men is relatively low compared to that of married men, thedecrease in overall earnings implies that through time, the law has affected the earnings ofmarried men negatively. On the other hand, we observe that time since enactment increasesthe overall earnings of all men when unmarried heterosexuals are used as the control group.[INSERT TABLE 4 HERE]In theory the law should not affect the control group, much less in the opposite direction.Our finding is subject to three possible interpretations. If married heterosexuals are the26The results on the difference in earnings between heterosexuals and homosexuals are consistent across allsamples. Note, however, that the estimate when using those identified as heads of household and unmarriedpartners as the comparison group in a separate estimation is statistically significant at the 10% level only.These results are available upon request.22appropriate reference group, anti-discriminatory laws have acted to close the earnings gapover time. If unmarried coupled heterosexuals are the appropriate reference group, the lawmay have acted to unnecessarily increase the wages of homosexual men (unnecessary becauseall other things equal, there does not seem to be a gap among these groups).Given that the inability of homosexuals to get married precludes us from determining thecorrect reference group, we consider a third interpretation. In the absence of earnings differ-ences between homosexual men and unmarried heterosexual men, the law has helped to notonly reduce the earnings gap between married heterosexuals and homosexual men throughtime, but also that between married and unmarried heterosexuals. If sexual orientation is notalways disclosed during the hiring process, employers cannot distinguish between unmarriedmen and individuals in same-sex relationships. Under the fear of lawsuits from potentiallynot hiring a homosexual, risk averse employers increase demand for both groups. The in-crease in the relative earnings of homosexual men can be still justified by the fact that anumber of homosexuals may purposely disclose their sexual orientation during the process.Due to employer budget constraints, married individuals may be subject to lower demandand lower wages. This combined effect is supported by the fact that the relative earningsof homosexual men increase faster relative to those of married than unmarried men. Notethat this is one of many possible explanations and that the true answer requires data whichcaptures the marriage inclinations of men in same-sex relationships. Yet, it provides a stepforward toward the understanding the influence of these laws and highlights the need forfuture research to carefully consider the reference group comparison construction.For the case of women, our DDD results confirm that women in same-sex relationships dotend earn more than heterosexual women, but the estimates are not statistically significant.2727Our robustness check using the group with women that consider themselves heads of household does yieldstatistical significance. However, we believe the results may be biased due to a small number of women willingto consider themselves as head of households in heterosexual couples, compared to homosexual ones whereat least one must meet this requirement. This difference is greater for women in unmarried heterosexualpartnerships. This suggests that married women that consider themselves as the head of the family mayearn slightly more than those that decide to not get married but also consider themselves as the head of thehousehold. Here, it is important to remember that in the Census, the head of the household is simply theperson chosen to answer the questionnaire. As such, we must acknowledge that there might be a random23In terms of the law, the second row in panel B of Table 4 suggests that given the time, place,and state trends, women in same-sex relationships in states with the law do not have earningsthat are statistically different than those of their counterparts in states without the law. Likein the case of men, the time for which the law has been in place does have an impact on theoverall earnings of women. For the most part, the longer the time the law has been in place,the higher the earnings for all women.The estimated impact of the law on the overall earnings of heterosexuals could alsobe driven by unobserved market changes. In the case of heterosexual men, other factorsmay have caused a downward trend in the earnings of married men, and an upward onefor the earnings of unmarried cohabitating men in those states. We examine the earningstrends for men and women and find that both married and unmarried groups follow similartrends. Figure 2 shows the average earnings of married and unmarried heterosexuals, andindividuals part of same-sex couples. In order to provide a comprehensive picture, we groupthem according to their decision to adopt the law or not. First, we show the trends using allfifty states. Second, we use the earnings of only those that have passed the law by the timeof measurement (like the one used for the DDD estimate). In order to account for previoustrends, we use those that have passed the law at any point in time. This means, for instance,that the 1990 and 2000 averages include the earnings of workers in Maryland even thoughthe state did not pass the law until 2001. Finally, we look at the trends for those states thatnever passed the law. In all cases, we observe that real earnings spiked in 2000, but haddropped by 2009.[INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE]The drop in real earnings for all groups in 2009 can be mostly explained by the 2008financial crises. However, we do observe that individuals in unmarried heterosexual relation-ships appeared to be the most affected. Married heterosexuals and homosexuals appearedto have experienced similar declines, which may be partly explained by the higher levels ofcomponent in who is considered the head of household.24education. Despite the steeper fall for unmarried couples, the picture does show that allgroups experienced similar trends regardless of whether a law was in place or not. Such sim-ilarities lead us to conclude that while other forces may shape the earnings of heterosexualsin states with anti-discriminatory laws, the opposite effects for married versus unmarriedheterosexual men may actually be a product of the law rather than unobserved factors.It also appears that ‘the time since law enactment’ is acting as a earning equalizer forhomosexual women as well, impacting women in the opposite direction, compared to men.In other words, given that homosexual women tend to earn more than their heterosexualcounterparts, employers in states with laws have no reason to fear the threat of a lawsuit fromthis group. Instead, they may be concerned about complaints from heterosexual women andbe inclined to raise their wages. Although not statistically significant, we observe that thetime since enactment lowers the relative wages of women in same-sex partnerships, partiallyproviding some support to the argument above.285 ConclusionThe influence, and potential influence, of anti-discriminatory laws on the basis of sexualorientation have been increasingly considered in literature. Though other studies have ana-lyzed the effect of these laws in the labor market, we are the first to use an extended timeframe, considering the robustness of the reference group specification, using a difference-in-difference-in-difference estimation approach. Like some of the previous literature, we confirmthe evidence that findings of earnings discrimination against homosexual men are sensitiveto the choice of reference group. This supports previous findings that suggest that earningsdifferentials may be largely driven by a marriage premium. Overall our results suggest that,relative to married heterosexual men, gay men earn less and anti-discriminatory laws, over28We also estimated effects of the anti-discrimination law on the probability of being in the labor force,employment, and full-time versus part-time work, capturing both extensive and intensive margins. Ourdata, however, is limited not allowing us to control for all factors that may affect labor supply, includingemployment opportunities in other cities, or perhaps other states. These and other concerns are supportedby very low pseudo and regular r-squared values. These results are available from the authors upon request.25time, lessen this gap. Relative to unmarried, but coupled heterosexual men, homosexualmen experience similar levels of earnings and both groups experience an increase in earningsover time after the passage of an anti-discriminatory law.Homosexual women experience higher earnings than their unmarried, coupled and mar-ried heterosexual female counterparts. The effect of the law is to shrink this gap over time,but in this case that results in lower earnings for homosexual women since they out-earnedtheir heterosexual counterparts. We employ a DDD approach that controls for trends instates and other local labor markets. In addition to allowing for different possible referencegroups, we also specify the impact of the laws at the state of work rather than the state ofresidence as previous research has done.Our results highlight two important policy issues. Statistically, the law seems to helpequalize the earnings of homosexuals with respect to their married counterparts. Yet, ourresults suggest that this equalization may not be solely due to increases in earnings of thosewith lower wages (e.g. homosexual men), but also decreases in the earnings of those who startwith higher wages (e.g. married heterosexual men). Unfortunately, the lack of informationon the attitudes of men and women in same-sex relationships toward marriage preclude usfrom conclusively understanding what part of the wage differentials is due to discrimination,and what to marriage, and what part of the law could be more effective at addressing pureissues of discrimination. However, our findings represent an increase in the understandingof the effect of anti-discriminatory laws on homosexual employment outcomes. While thelaw seems to reduce the marriage premium, it raises the question on whether legislation toallow marriage between two men or two women will help to further dissipate the differencesin the labor market between homosexuals and heterosexuals. If marriage is acting as asignal, blocking the ability of some groups to signal appropriately may result in labor marketdistortions.On the other hand, if we assume that wage gaps are mostly due to household specializa-tion, instead, it is not clear if legal recognition of same-sex marriage would have an effect26on earnings. Indeed, gay and lesbian couples are more likely to split household tasks moreequally.29 Assuming that the allocation of household tasks remains unchanged after same-sexmarriage, repealing DOMA may have little impact on specialization and/or the marriage pre-mium. Yet, the ability bias explanation for the existence of a marriage premium may makeDOMA have an effect on the relative earnings of homosexuals as marriage may incentivizesingle (or uncoupled) homosexuals to look for more capable spouses.In the absence of a comprehensive law that allows marriage between individuals of thesame sex, future research focusing on finding ways to determine the correct reference groupis necessary in order to understand what policies will help eliminate wage gaps that aredue to discrimination, and reduce those due to marriage but unrelated to productivity. Ourresults also suggest that allowing homosexuals to marry may reduce the earnings differentialwithout the imposition of labor market distortions created by anti-discrimination laws.29See Kurdek (1993) for a discussion on the determinants of household specialization among gay andlesbians couples.27ReferencesAcemoglu, Daron and Joshua D.

    "abstract": "Anti-discrimination laws on the basis of sexual orientation have been adopted by many states to counteract perceived discrimination in the labor market. We �find that relative\n\nto married heterosexual men, homosexual men earn less and anti-discriminatory laws, over time, partially lessen this gap. This gap is statistically non-existent relative to unmarried heterosexual men. Homosexual women, on the other hand, experience higher earnings than their heterosexual female counterparts, and the law shrinks this gap over\n\ntime. Our results suggest that although the earnings differential may be due to the marriage premium, anti-discriminatory laws do help reduce labor market differences\n\nbetween homosexuals and heterosexuals. We conjecture that allowing homosexuals to marry could reduce the earnings inequality without creating potentially significant labor market distortions",
