As  part  of  minoritygroups, the social construction about transgender is often in poor  perspective.  They  are   seen  asfunny characters who become stock of  joke  and  attract  cynical  expression  since  they  behavesabnormally. Though not quite different with real life, the  depiction  of  transgender  characters  inmovies is more various. This paper is going to compare  the  idea  of  how  transgender  charactersplay his roles in Kinky Boots movie and Realita Cinta dan Rock ‘n Roll. The first  movie’s  settingis in British society, while the second one is in Indonesian society. By  comparing  and  examiningthe representation of transgender in different background,  this  study  enriches  the  idea  that  thisminority group is depicted in more or less similar.Key words: transgender, Kinky Boots, Realita Cinta dan Rock ‘n Roll, performative act.INTRODUCTIONCommonly, transgender refers to the idea of gendered appearance which  does   not  matchwith one’s biological sex. The concept may cover transvestites, transsexual, cross-dresser,  genderqueer, drag  queen/drag  king.  As  gender  is  not  similar  with  sexual  orientation,  the  genderedappearance do not relate to a certain sexual tendency either; a transvestite may a male  who  fulfillhis feminine inner calling to dress like a woman, yet he is  female  sexually  oriented  person.  Theterm transvestite itself was firstly discovered by Magnus Hirschfeld in the early  part  of  the  20thcentury and he points out that transvestite concerned more with psychological  gender  signs  suchas dress and names. In general,  the  emergence  of  transgender  is  as  old  as  human  civilizationtracing back to 1480s BC in Egypt Kingdom when pharaoh Hathsepshut  had  to  invent  a  hybridgender for a pharaoh which by definition should be a male.In Indonesia, the existence of transgender nowadays is more  obviously  seen  than  five  orten years ago. In public places, we could see males who perform in  female  gendered  appearance,completed with distinctive female attributions and body gestures.  On mass media, we watch malepublic figures who act femininely and may dress in “female motives and colors”.  Apart  from  thenumber,  which  needs  to  be  surveyed  statistically,  the  celebration  of  freedom  of  expression,especially after the Reformation Era, becomes one of the factors why those transgender  looks  areback and forth in our surroundings.Furthermore, British society also experiences  the  development  of  transgendered  people.Though statistically difficult to obtain the data about gender identity, based on the survey done  byGIRES (Gender Identity Research and Education Society) in 2009, it is assumed that  in  the  U.K.there were 300,000 transgendered people defined as those who cross dress (Reed et.al, 2009:13).The idea about transgendered both  in  Indonesia  and  British  society  also  appears  in  itsmovies. Kinky Boots which put Northampton as its setting of place and Realita Cinta dan Rock  ‘nRoll with its Jakarta’s setting depict how transgendered life in the two cultural opposite  countries.Kinky Boots which is the production of Virgo VCD, was firstly released in  2006  and  talks  aboutthe collapse of shoe  factory  Price  &  Son.  Charlie  Price,  the  fourth  generation  owner,  shoulddrudge seeking the solution to survive the company, otherwise he has to sell it. In the midst of  hismany serious problems, Charlie met Lola who happens to be a transvestite, working as a singer  ina transvestite night club. The unique  friendship  between  Charlie  and  Lola  –  the  man  and  thetransvestite- in rescuing the company raises many interesting sequences in Kinky Boots.Produced in the same year,  Realita  Cinta  dan  Rock  ‘n  Roll  tells  about  the  journey  offinding identity of two good friends- Ipang and Nugi. As rock lovers,  they  dreamed  of  having  apopular rock band and becoming a famous music star. Finding out that their family condition doesnot support them, these two  young  men  decided  to  live  with  Nugi’s  father  outside  the  town.Instead of getting peacefulness, Nugi  and  Ipang  should  keep  a  good  relationship  with  Nugi’sfather who turns out a transvestite, Mama. The presence of Mama which changes Nugi  and  Ipangemerges some important points.Taking those two movies as the object of the study, this paper is going to  analyze  thepresence of transvestites in relation to their social environment, the conflict they faced  and  howthey manage to adapt or reconcile with its surroundings. By applying qualitative content  analysis,the discussion in  this  paper  will  put  Judith  Butler  ideas  on  performative  gender  as  its  maintheoretical perspectivesTHEORITICAL FRAMEWORKSIn her essay on gender, Simone de Beauvoir points out  that  “one  is  not  born,  but  ratherbecomes a woman”. This doctrine amplifies the idea that if sex  is  a  fact,  the  role  of  sexes  is  amatter of cultural and historical condition in which it develops  through  times  and  social  setting.Thus body, to her point of view, is a dynamic “historical situation” to which  it  embodies  culturalconstruction. In this understanding, then female and being a  woman  is  two  different   things   inwhich the later represents how culture and history shape the idea of the  biological  fact-  fragility,domesticity.In relation to the dynamic ideas of de Beauvoir, Judith Butler furthermore  underlines  thatgender identity therefore is not a stable one, it  keeps  on  changing  for  it  is  a  repetition  of  actsthrough time. Taking the analogy from acting  performance,  Butler  argues  that  in  everyday  lifeacts constitutes shared experience and collective social action in  which  it  becomes  social  actionwhen it is performed repeatedly. She explains that “gender reality  is  performative  which  means,quite simply, that it is real only to the extent that it  is  performed  “(Butler,  1990:527).  Thereforegender can be neither right nor wrong, neither original nor fake.ANALYSISAside  of  its  genre  and  the  number  of  its  appearences  in  the  scenes,  the   representation   oftransgendered figures in Kinky  Boots  and  Realita  Cinta  dan  Rock’n  Roll  has  some  importantpoints to ponder.a. Social ReactionsThe two transgendered characters in these movies  represent  different  social  status.  Lolaworks in entertainment world in where she works as a nightclub singer who has to struggle hard towork almost every night. In the opening scenes of Kinky Boots, Lola-dressing in red colored  dressand lipstic- is singing in front of her transgendered friends and male spectators as well who  keepson yelling or mocking him. In relation to his social status,  Lola’s  work  can  be  taken  as  middleclass profession and for transgendered person  working in the  entertainment  world  apparently  isone of the best choices to get money professionally.Reversely, Nugi’s father- called Mama, is depicted as an upper class housewive who  livesin a beautiful luxurious furnished house. Practicing modern dance in  his  extravagant  livingroom,Mama represents a high class transgendered character.The choice of profession to illustrate Mama and  Lola  is  interesting  to  compare  since  itgives impact to how the two transgendered characters experience social  interaction  and  reaction.As a middle class singing worker, Lola should be  able  to  manage  his  relationship  with  variouskinds of society. It is to say that his exposure in  open  social  interaction  attracts  social  responseand pressure as well. On the contrary, since Mama’s life deals with domestic  affairs,  he  is  muchmore imune from social reactions and much more protected from social pressures.The  very  first  social  reactions  to  Lola  can  be  seen  when  Charlie-the  Price  and  Soncompany owner forbides her to visit him  in  Northampton,  whereas  he  asked  Lola  as  his  shoemodel to save his company  financial  problem.  The  forbidness  means  that  Charlie  accepts  thecommon general idea that dealing with transvetites is something embarassing, a deal that must  bekept secretly. It can be read from the following excerpt:Charlie : Sorry it’s a bit messy. Um, we... I thought we agreed that I’d come to London.Lola     : I have to warn you, Charlie from Northampton, I’ve a habit of doingexactly the        opposite of what people want. In fact some might say thatattempts of certain people to make a man out of me as a child is the reason that Inow wear a frock. If I get the feeling somebody didn’t want me to come toNorthampton...Charlie  : No, no, no.Lola      : Also, I can tell from years of experience when I’m being smuggled in through arear door.Charlie  : That’s the rough stuff room.Lola       :  Is it?(Kinky Boots, CD 1, 34:05 – 34:43)When Charlie finally succeded in persuading Lola to be his shoe model, he  promised  himto take the boots to London once it is already finished. His  reason  is  more  because  he  wants  tohide Lola’s existence before his employers. Charlie does not want his staffs know  he  made  bootsfor a transvetite. Yet, Lola –who notices that he’s not accepted coming  to  Northampton-suddenlyshows up in Charlie’s factory without notice. He understands that most  people will try to hide  hiscoming through a rear  door.  This  confession  illustrates  that   transgendered  people  experiencediscrimination  once  they  interact  socially,  once  they  perform  gender  identity   as   somethingopposing to his biological sex. The discrimination according to Judith Butler  is  taken  as  culturalpunishment. She says “performing one’s gender wrong initiates a set of punishment  both  obviousand indirect..culture so readily punishes or marginalizes those who fail to perform  the  illusion  ofgender essentialism…” (Butler, 1990:528)Among his friends, Mama looks convenient with his   life  since  most  of  them  enjoy  hiscompanion and seemingly do not pay attention to his  performance.  Similar  to  Kinky  Boots,  thetransgendered character in Realita Cinta dan Rock ‘n Roll-  which is casted by  Indonesian  movielegend, Barry Prima- can get along better with  female  characters  to  male  characters.  Lola  is  agood acquitance for female shoe workers in Charlie’s company, while Mama is also a  nice  friendfor his female dance friends. Somehow,  Mama  is  not  depicted  having  social  interactions  withmore various kinds of society apart of her dance friends. In other words, the domesticity of  Mamacharacters does not allow him to meet with other characters outside his family circle. In  this  case,Mama therefore is much more protected from social pressures. Though in his  conversation  to  hisex-wife, he says :Mama  : Kamu nggak tahu rasanya menjadi orang seperti aku. Selalu dipandang  sebelahmata, dihina, ditertawakan. Tapi yang paling menyakitkan kau kalausampai annakku sendiri tak bisa menerima aku. (menangis)Ibu Nugi            : Sabar. Sabar ya.                                                (Realita Cinta dan Rock ‘n Roll,  CD2, 28:26-29:27)b. Family ConflictThough social pressures become the main drawback for a transgendered figure in dealing with  thesociety, inevitably he also deals  with  personal  conflict.  The  major  personal  conflict  is  mostlycaused by his relationship to his nuclear family. Both in Kinky Boots and Realita Cinta  dan  Rock‘n Roll do not present the cause why Lola and Mama want to  perform  like  what  woman  usuallydoes. Since childhood, Lola was trained by his father to be a boxer. Yet  he  could  not  ignore  hisinner passion to wear woman dresses. After the harassment done by Don- the most macho man  inCharlie’s company who underestimate him, Lola recalled his experience:Lola        : Boxer. Get out of here. I’m serious. He had me doing training. Weights.  Icould bench-press 93 kilos. I owe all my spectacular muscle definition  tomy father. What, and he never... The  whole  wearing  frocks  thing...  Ah,well  he  wasn’t  stupid.  He  knew  there’d  be  very   few   cross-dressingheavyweight champions. Yeah. No, he disowned  me.  Wouldn’t  see  me.Even when he got lung cancer, he wouldn’t. So, it’s ironic really. [sighs]                  Fags got him in the end. Ba-doom-doom. Tshh! I mean, that’s what it wasall about. Fitting  in.  Melding  in.  Not  standing  out.  As  far  as  he  wasconcerned, if you’re big and you’re black and you’re a boxer then you aresorted. If  you’re  big  and  you’re  black  and  you’re  in  a...  you  know...strapless cocktail dress, that’s not so good. That’s  what  my  dad  wanted,an’all.                                                                           (Kinky Boots, CD 1, 44:35-45:30)This becomes Lola’s regret that he could not forget- that his father could  not  accept  whathe is, could not understand what he wants to be. His regret becomes unforgettable as his father didnot to see him even up to the end of his life.Meanwhile, the personal conflict also happens to Mama when Nugi, for his very first time,found out who he is.Mama  : Aku tahu mungkin susah untukmu untuk menerima semua ini dan aku tahu kamupasti kecewa dan marah. Aku tidak akan paksa kamu untuk menerimaku begitusaja. Tapi kamu harus tahu bahwa aku begini bukan tanpa alasan.Nugi       : Yang aku tahu dalam keluarga itu cuma ada ayah dan ibu. Jadi yang lainnya aku nggak pengen tahu.               (Nugi meninggalkan ruang. Mama sedih)                                                (Realita Cinta dan Rock ‘n Roll,  CD2, 06:35-07:36)Gender identity of  Lola and Mama is signified  by  the  common  idea  of  being  man  andwoman. When they performed as men, Lola was   used  to  practice  boxing,  while  Mama  was  amartial art athlete – the sport which is so-called as  male sports.  When  they  perform  as  women,they become more sensitive, wear woman dress and jewelry, talk and walk attractively. Somehow,unluckily when they perform as women, there are some  happenings  which  enforce  them  to  usetheir power as a male to protect others.c. ReconciliationIt is taken as reconciliation to refer to the idea that when Lola and Mama perform as a manby showing his male prowess, the social and personal conflict becomes reconciled. Their domesticand social environment which at first seem rejecting them turn to  accepting  for  Lola  and  Mamahave shown their masculine roles. They may dress and act like woman, but  when  it  is  necessarythey have to act as a man as expected by the social construction.When Lola came  to  The  Boot  Café  to  have  arm  wrestling  match  with  Don,   he  wassupported by most of his colleagues in the shoe company. At first, Don seems  to  win  the  match.But then, Lola takes over. Approaching to its end, Lola understand that it  would  be  better  to  letDon win the match because he  will  unable  to  bear  the  loss  over  a  transvestite.  Therefore,  herelented. Don who understand that Lola has intentionally made him win changed  his  mind  abouttransvestite and the whole things in the making of transvestite’s shoe project. He accepts Lola  andsupports the project happily.Mama is also experiencing the same thing either. Nugi who did not know that  Mama  is  agood martial art athlete is surprised when he witnesses his Mama fighting against a  pickpocket  ina market. After knowing that Mama is such a fierce person, Nugi’s acceptance emerges.  He  feelsproud of him though his  Mama  performs  like  a  woman.  Not  only  acceptance,  Nugi  also  cantolerate the peculiarity of Mama’s characters. Although he was disappointed  when  he  found  outthat his Mama’s sexual orientation is to a man, at the end of the story of  Realita  Cinta  dan  Rock‘n Roll it shows that Nugi accepts his Mama  wholeheartedly  by,  for  the  first  time,  calling  himMama.Those two examples symbolizes that gender performance even to transgendered  people  isstill  an  active  battling  ground.  Although  their  repetitive  acts  make  them  as   women,   somecircumstances may enforce them  to  get  out  from  the  repetition,  experiencing  or  doing  thingswhich is parallel to their biological sexes and pre-determined roles upon sexes.CONCLUSIONThere is an interesting statement which is spoken over and over  by  Lola  in  Kinky  Boots  movie,that is : ladies, gentlemen and those who haven’t made up his mind yet.  Lola  keeps  on  saying  itevery time he undergoes his performance as  a  transvestite  singer  in  The  Angel  Club.  Both  inKinky Boots and Realita Cinta dan Rock ‘n Roll movie, the phrase  “those  who  haven’t  made  uphis  mind  yet”  attracts  some  important  notions.  Though   having   different   setting   of   socialbackground, the depiction of transgendered figure on both  movies  is  more  or  less  similar-  thatthey experience social pressure and discrimination,  they  have  to  deal  with  family  conflict  andfinally  they  can  reconcile  with  their  surroundings  after  showing  their  prowess.  The  idea  ofshowing the masculine power of  Lola  and  Mama  as  the  reconciling  factor  in  the  story  givesunderstanding  that  Britain  and  Indonesia  share  similar  cultural  perspective   in   viewing   theacceptance of transgendered people.REFERENCESCorber and Valocchi ED.

The first movie’s setting is in British society, while the second one is in Indonesian society. By  comparing and examining  the representation of transgender in different background, this study enriches the idea that this minority group is depicted in more or less similar",
