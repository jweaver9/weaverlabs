A Black, lesbian, feminist, social justice activist, educator, and friend, whose legacy echoes throughout our queer and trans communities. Achebe offered visionary leadership in the early stages of Astraea’s founding. Her impact and tireless advocacy has left an indelible mark on everyone within our organization, and has allowed us to carry out her mission and vision these last 45 years. Rest in Power, Achebe Powell.Astraea Lesbian Foundation for JusticeFY2022 Annual ReportDesigner: Kimberly Costa, Adam Shaw-Vardi (Lousch Creations)Writing: Brooke Havlik (consultant)Editing & Project Management Team: Kayla McMillen, Robin WilbyContributors: Ruth Baldacchino, Joy Chia, Rebecca Fox, Patrice Smith SterlingAstraea’s Illustrated History Illustration by Sonaksha Iyengar (https://sonaksha.com/)Friends,This year, we are celebrating our 45th anniversary and the joy of our collective movements’ past and present. We are looking back on our more than four and a half decades of philanthropy, and as one of the first international funders of LGBTQI+ movements. The old photographs Astraea keeps hung on our office walls and archives help us all to remember our roots. Photographs of bold organizers on the frontlines inspire us. Grainy black and white photographs of Astraea staff and partners gathering decades ago reflect the core values that continue to define us: care, courage, resistance, and solidarity. Some of our memories can be stronger than others, and help define how we remember the past. Neuroscientists call our most heightened memories a “flashbulb memory,” which is vivid and surrounds a dramatic or historical event. For example, I remember exactly where I was on Celebrating our Past, Boldly Resourcing our FutureJune 24, 2011 when New York State passed marriage equality–watching the news with my grandmother and my now-wife. Though it can be tempting to look at these “flashbulb” moments written in history books as the ultimate triggers for social change, these historical moments do not exist in a vacuum. The truth is: it’s the moments that we often forget that matter just as much for building resilient, intersectional movements. Over 45 years, Astraea’s staff and partners have witnessed ups and downs, and both celebrations and disagreements. Many of these memories won’t be captured on film or memorialized in history books. At Astraea, we remember both the joy and struggle. And as funders, we don’t believe change happens just in those “flashbulb” memories that often make history books. These big, historical moments emerge because of the well-connected movement infrastructure that brings together different organizations, communities, networks, and activists to push together for change. That’s why we continue to ground our philanthropy model on supporting grantees with unrestricted and flexible resources, which allow movements to build capacity and strengthen their resiliency to respond to community needs.  Our annual report, 45 Years of Joy in Resistance, showcases the work Astraea has done in 2022 to move resources where they are greatly needed and to continue to support grassroots LGBTQI+ organizing, no matter how difficult the circumstances. We are proud to share that in 2022:• Astraea disbursed more than $5.9 million in 2022 to 230 grantee partners through 263 grants• Over 86% of our grantees received general operating support grants, allowing for flexibility• 83% of our international grantmaking went to organizations in countries with obstructed, repressed and closing civil societiesCelebrating Astraea’s vibrant history necessitates celebrating and learning from all the incredible people who have had a role in shaping it. Hearing their stories. Learning about their connections to Astraea, to each other, and to movements. Their activism, their joys, and their struggles. And hearing about their lives. This is what queer feminist philanthropy looks like. Thank you for your continued support. Yours in Solidarity, Joy L. Chia (she/her) Executive DirectorWelcome from Executive Director, Joy Chia4 5   Annual Report 2022  //  A Letter from Joy A Letter from Joy  //     Annual Report 2022As funders, we believe our responsibility is not only to resource our movements through grantmaking, but also to support them to grow and thrive through capacity-strengthening, accompaniment, and advocating for their brilliant work across philanthropy! This year, we continued to expand on these efforts: from our first open call for Strategic Communications grants, to supporting our grantees with pandemic-related emergency funds. Through building deep relationships with our grantees, our peers, and our donors, we’re working together to create stronger ecosystems to walk alongside our movements and understand what they need to remain resilient, fight back against exclusion and repression, and care for themselves and each other. Growing Movements Across Regions and Borders6 7   Annual Report 2022  //  Growing Movements Growing Movements  //     Annual Report 2022For nearly 45 years, Astraea’s funding in the United States has responded to our community’s calls for full and radical queer, trans, and intersex liberation. We believe that the most radical work is overwhelmingly led by Two-Spirit (2S), LGBTQI+, and Black, Indigenous or people of color who lead from an intersectional vision. These communities are fighting for survival in a country facing rising threats of fascism, a disturbing trend that continues to use state violence and surveillance to silence their voices and dreams. Astraea’s grantees continue their work through necessity, grounded in the twin beliefs that a different world is possible and that it is within our reach. Astraea’s U.S. Fund’s work is oriented towards this future: our support can create tangible change that impacts our communities that aids in the arrival of this new world.Funding the Grassroots While Meeting The Moment in America 8 9   Annual Report 2022  //  Growing Movements Growing Movements  //     Annual Report 2022Astraea’s U.S. Fund staff members are also part of community and movement spaces, and we often find ourselves personally on the frontlines of the very battles in which Astraea is engaged in America. Our lived experiences inform our funding and our values, and guide us as we do our part to build safety and resilience for our communities. Astraea’s work is grounded in the belief that marginalized populations who are closest to this nation’s many problems must be at the center of creating solutions. Our unique proximity to our grantees’ work allows us to incorporate our own experiences of grassroots organizing in the U.S. (particularly the U.S. South) during times of uncertainty and heightened safety concerns into our grantmaking strategy.Our grantees have always faced threats and organized under dangerous, and sometimes violent conditions, but we have seen an alarming increase in risks and threats to community organizing in 2021-2022. Astraea’s U.S. grantees include communities organizing at the intersections of systemic discrimination, including:• Black migrants, queer and trans asylum seekers, Two-Spirit and queer Indigenous communities organizing on their stolen land, queer and trans communities of color heavily impacted by incarceration and policing, sex workers, and other constituencies facing high levels of oppression.   Astraea’s U.S. Fund supports groups who are chronically and intentionally underfunded, but whose work is critical to the safety and security of our communities. The groups we support have been systematically excluded from access to funders and philanthropies, creating a dangerous situation that is only becoming more dire due to the pandemic, the economic climate, resurgence in anti-LGBTQ attitudes in government, and rising violence against our communities. It is with these increased challenges to an already precarious situation that Astraea chose to focus on renewing funding to its existing grantees in the U.S. this year, increasing support where possible. Astraea’s U.S. Fund also spent the last year undergoing a visioning period to ensure that as our fund grows, the grants we make are sufficiently bold enough to meet this crucial moment in America’s history. Through this visioning process, Astraea’s U.S. Fund has established that we will continue to provide and, where possible, expand flexible core funding to our existing portfolio as well as seek relationships with new groups, especially those whose work touches on bodily autonomy, lesbian, bi and queer women leadership, housing and land acquisition, migrant justice, and the climate crisis. Our new core funding priorities, which were developed based on consultation with our funding peers and grantees, boldly answer this moment’s call and represent the areas Astraea is uniquely positioned to fund.We are proud of the process to reenvision and reimagine how Astraea supports leadership and organizational growth at this critical juncture in the U.S. to build power and win against some of the most challenging times we have seen in our last 45 years.10 11   Annual Report 2022  //  Growing Movements Growing Movements  //     Annual Report 2022Connecting Transnational Movements to Counter the Anti-Gender PlaybookThe words “family” and “gender” are frequently used by right-wing politicians around the world in campaigns to stir up panic about an alleged threat to conservative or fundamentalist values. This rise of populist anti-gender movements remains a significant threat to our collective safety and progress as global LGBTQI+ communities. By pushing a singular ideology of what family is supposed to be and how people are supposed to live their lives, conservative actors are aligning under the umbrella of anti-gender movements to undermine democracy worldwide.  This anti-gender strategy threatens the very lives of LGBQTI+ people. We see it manifesting in discriminatory legislation, the criminalization of queer and trans people, and violence against feminists and LGBTQI+ activists and communities. While anti-gender movements have different historical, national, or social roots, research has shown that they are frequently well-connected and inform each other’s strategies across borders and sectors. One important way for Astraea to counter this is to support and fund strategies that collaborate across borders – and by supporting organizations who are building bigger, more inclusive movements. That is why one of the focuses of our international funding is bridge-building. To build solidarity, organizations need the space and resources to connect, which creates opportunities for meaningful alliances. For example, in the Caribbean, grantees co-created a learning space on how to be in the struggle for collective liberation in the long term, and how to support each other through challenging times.Anti-gender movements have deep pockets, receiving significantly more funding than LGBTQI+, feminist, and human rights campaigners to do their organizing work. In the last few years, U.S. Christian Right groups alone have 12 13   Annual Report 2022  //  Growing Movements Growing Movements  //     Annual Report 2022spent at least $280 million dollars - with the majority of spending in Europe - to fuel campaigns against the rights of women and LGBTQI+ people. Astraea is working to end this resource disparity and fund organizations across geographies committed to challenging anti-gender movements. This is reflected in where we fund, what we fund,how we fund, and how we engage in philanthropic advocacy. We know that our movements need resources to strengthen their capacity to face attacks on many different fronts, and that they need the flexibility to make their own decisions on priorities. This is why we are prioritizing long-term flexible grants that grantees can use to support their core work, build internal infrastructure, or gain new skills and capacities. This year, we awarded over $4.4 million to 130 grantees in 55 countries to build queer, trans, and intersex power and counter the anti-gender movements’ playbook. We welcomed 21 new grantee partners, including groups in more difficult political environments such as Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey. We remain committed to funding in challenging political and social contexts, knowing that our communities are in great need of resources and solidarity. In 2022, over 83% of our international grantmaking went to organizations in countries with obstructed, repressed, and closing civil societies, which are often a primary target of anti-gender movements. We support these organizations through multi-year and flexible funding, allowing organizations in some of the most challenging situations to shift and change direction when needed – whether it is physical and digital security resources to legal support.While the road to liberation is complex, increasingly our strategies are focusing on learning from each other, building transnational solidarity, and increasing flexible funding to ensure this is an equal fight. In fact, it is the only way forward to ensure safety and freedom for our families - however we choose to define them.14 15   Annual Report 2022  //  Growing Movements Growing Movements  //     Annual Report 2022Our grantees build power by coming together through a variety of strategies and coalitions to make tangible change in people’s lives. Throughout our history and into our future, they are building the foundation for just and inclusive environments at the local and international level. From providing critical public health services and guidance, to advocating for legal rights and recognition, our grantee partners are constantly working to create brighter, stronger futures for our people everywhere.Alerta Torta Córdoba is an assembly organization formed by 17 lesbians from diverse movements and disciplines in Córdoba, working to expand rights for lesbians in Argentina through community organizing. In February 2022, they brought together more than 300 lesbian activists in an intersectional feminist space called Tortazo 2022. The event was inclusive of neurodivergent people and people with disabilities, with anti-punitivist, anti-capitalist and anti-speciesist values.

Every single dollar makes a difference, stretching all the way back to Astraea’s cross-class founding around a kitchen table in 1977. Therefore, we present our donor list alphabetically, rather than by size of gift, as a better reflection of our true appreciation of each and every one of you.
