Students read two out of nine queer-themed YA novels paired with a collection of nonfiction and media on topics that ranged from rethinking gender norms in society to historical issues that impact people with intersectional queer identities. The author collaboratively designed, planned, and taught the 6-week unit at the center of the study, Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Clubs, using a critical queer pedagogy framework.  The findings illuminated the ways in which pedagogy that nurtures and prizes student voice, critical reading, discussion, and humanizing classroom discourse work to situate students as empathic critical readers and writers of the world. The findings suggest that analyzing queer- themed literature moves students to build empathy, disrupts oppression, and humanizes people of all identities, thus empowering youth as producers and consumers of knowledge that facilitates their growth and supports queer and questioning youth. In addition, students found common experiences as teenagers with the queer characters across the novels, therby affirming the decision to use exclusively YA fiction for the book club and serving to aid in disrupting dominant discourses about queer youth. The study concludes with a suggestion for seven implications for practice and a call for further research that aims to advance culturally relevant queer pedagogy.   i  TABLE OF CONTENTS LIST OF TABLES

community, teachers, principal, and students of Pearl Street Collaborative High School. I am grateful for the collaboration and generosity of the four teachers who participated in the study. They took risks and ventured into new teaching terrain, which allowed me to conduct research that I care about deeply. And I am in awe of the 44 young people who I had the pleasure and the honor of teaching, and their humane treatment of complex issues and each other. I must also thank and acknowledge my partner, Ed, for his love, his limitless encouragement, and his desire to see me cross the finish line which, many times, felt like an impossibility. He believed in me when I did not think I could continue. My brother, Michael—I might not be a teacher if it weren’t for the love, patience, and acceptance I learned from being  his older sister, advocate, and protector. And my brother, Vaughn—whose bravery and determination to be who he is has taught me how to be a better human being. I offer heartfelt thanks to my dissertation committee, whose brilliance inspired me to keep writing. I am especially grateful for Mollie Blackburn and her continued guidance, support, and kindness over the years, and for Ernest Morrell whose insightful and revolutionary feedback helped me at crucial stages of my work. I am indebted to Sheridan Blau, who took an interest in my research at its earliest, most raw form, and appreciate Adele Bruni Ashley, both for her attention and support.  And not least, I want to thank Yolanda Sealey-Ruiz, though I struggle to find the words that adequately express my profound love and appreciation for her: as my sponsor and my friend. Yolanda, you have always known how to lift my spirits by encouraging me to speak the truth. Thank you for pushing me to a better writer, teacher, scholar, and person.    1  Chapter I   INTRODUCTION  Context  It is powerful to envision high school English classrooms as inclusive spaces where teachers embrace pedagogy that seeks to undermine oppression with literacy curricula that engage students in a radical examination of social norms and hierarchies that perpetuate inequality. Such teaching is possible and is happening, but anti-oppressive education does not always include diverse sexualities and genders for the ways it is complicated and often not part of teacher preparation programs or school initiatives.   Domestically, some states in the United States, like California and, more recently, New Jersey, have begun to require teaching that acknowledges the existence and contributions of queer people (Ly & Thompson, 2019). In addition, Illinois is poised to become the third state requiring inclusive curricula, pending Governor J. B. Pritzker’s approval (Bowden, 2019). Internationally, Scotland made headlines (Brooks, 2018) for passing legislation that requires teaching that is inclusive of diverse sexualities and genders, not only in English class but across school curricula. Hopefully, there will come a time when teaching that includes the lives, experiences, and contributions of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/ questioning1) people will not be so revolutionary and will instead be the norm, as this kind of teaching has the power to save lives.  At a time when the internet has been weaponized to promote and disseminate language that upholds White supremacy, hate, xenophobia, and hateful rhetoric, education and literacy are charged with an even greater responsibility for the survival of democracy. Educators cannot give                                                 1 I discuss the shifting terminology I use in this dissertation later in this chapter.   2  up hope. As a teacher and teacher educator with 18 years of experience in New York City, I firmly believe that teaching literature with a social justice lens has enormous potential and can be used to position students as powerful readers of the word and the world, so that they can intervene, interrupt hatred, and critique oppression. LGBTQ youth report that inclusive curricula makes a significant impact on their learning and feeling safe in school (Kosciw, Greytak, Zongrone, Clark, & Truong, 2018). Yet the discrimination against and exclusion of LGBTQ people persist in the United States. Education legislation, commonly known as “No Promo Homo” laws, are laws that prohibit teachers of health/sexuality education from discussing lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) people or topics in a positive light—if at all.2 These laws, currently on the books in seven states, are typically misapplied and used to justify the exclusion of any curricula that include queer- or LGBTQ-related content, and have also been used to ban GSAs (gender and sexuality alliances, formerly known as gay-straight alliances) and any student clubs whose focus is on issues that support and affirm queer identities. In addition, transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive youth are finding their rights to exist and receive an education under attack. Betsy DeVos, the Trump Administration’s appointed Secretary of Education, complied with former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ insistence to rescind the Obama Administration’s Title IX guidelines for schools, which included protections that allowed transgender students to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity (Peters, Becker, & Hirschfeld Davis, 2017). The Obama Administration’s protections of transgender Americans Civil rights, which incorporated a more inclusive definition of gender as being determined by an individual and not a birth certificate, are being systematically dismantled. A recent New York Times investigative report found a memo detailing an effort to define gender as a fixed biological trait, refuting science and erasing                                                 2 https://www.glsen.org/learn/policy/issues/nopromohomo   3  intersex and transgender people (Green, Benner, & Pear, 2018), and was so devastating to the transgender community that spontaneous protests erupted all over the country and the social media campaign #WontBeErased evolved. LGBTQIA*+3 people exist and have always existed. It is cruel and unjust to relegate queer students to focus on surviving school rather than on learning and education (Miller, 2016). Framing the Problem Currently, most schools lack a queer inclusive English language arts (ELA) curriculum which puts all students, especially those who are LGBTQIA*+, at risk socially, physically, emotionally, and academically. GLSEN, the leading nonprofit educational research and advocacy organization that works to provide safe and supportive environments for all students regardless of sexuality, gender identity or expression, suggested four supports for LGBTQ students: visible, supportive educators; inclusive and affirming policies; inclusive curriculum and resources; and student clubs that support LGBTQ visibility, such as GSAs.4 The 2017 GLSEN National School Climate Survey, a biannual quantitative study concerned with the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer youth in schools, revealed for the first time since they began collecting data in 1999 that support for LGBTQ students has stalled, and for transgender and gender nonconforming students, their experiences have actually gotten worse (Kosciw et al., 2018). But the survey also revealed that there are better outcomes for students who attend schools that teach queer inclusive curricula. LGBTQ students who attend schools with an inclusive curriculum feel safer in school and have better mental health and academic outcomes. Students in schools with queer inclusive curricula encounter fewer homophobic                                                 3 LGBTQIA*+ refers to identities that are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, with * and + to acknowledge that language must continue to shift and evolve to be inclusive of all sexuality and gender identities. 4 https://www.glsen.org/article/glsens-four-supports   4  remarks and negative remarks about transgender people, are less likely to feel unsafe because of their sexual orientation or gender expression, are less likely to miss school, and report lower levels of depression and higher levels of self-esteem (Kosciw et al., 2018). Reading queer inclusive literature offers all young people ways to envision a more just, equal society—a society that feels responsible for and values its citizens, and one that stands up for those who are marginalized.  Unfortunately, many ELA teachers avoid, refuse, or reject the importance of teaching queer-inclusive curricula. Some teachers and administrators do not view teaching that addresses LGBTQIA*+ themes and content as a priority, many do not know how, and in some locales, it is even banned and deemed inappropriate for young learners. This is problematic on multiple levels and serves to dehumanize people. What about students who have same-sex parents at home or live within alternative familial structures? What about students who do not see themselves reflected anywhere in the curriculum? What becomes of students who get the message that their experiences and identities are invalid, irrelevant, or unacceptable? It is stating the obvious that the exclusion and erasure of those with queer identities from school spaces contribute to inhumane cruelty perpetrated on the bodies and minds of queer youth. LGBTQIA*+ youth of color are the most at-risk group in our education system for the ways they have been systematically cast to the margins and denied the right to learn in a loving, safe environment. There is a need for more research on the experiences of queer and gender expansive youth of color because of the ways that racism complicates heterosexism and gender oppression for them (Griffin & Ouellett, 2003).     5  (Queer) Terminology5 Historically, language has been used as a tool of oppression to denigrate and dehumanize marginalized, colonized people. Language and literacy can also be a liberating force, claimed by the oppressed as a dialogic of freedom (Freire, 1999). With these ideas in mind, it may be useful to define and contextualize some of the terminologies I use in this dissertation. Language that is used in reference to people of diverse sexual orientations and genders continues to shift and evolve, and new terms are being created (especially by queer youth) every day (Miller, 2015). Here, I must also acknowledge that by attempting to name and define my choices in language, I am resistant to doing so and conflicted about the need for such. Since my aim as a researcher is to effect social change, a discussion of terms I use may help put my work into a historical context because of the changing nature of language. What follows is my attempt to make my language choices visible.  Queer. I do not use this as an umbrella term to encompass all sexual orientations and genders, but as a term that resists naming and labeling sexuality and gender. I often use the terms queer literature and YA queer literature while referring to the curriculum at the center of this study, but, as Britzman (1995) suggested in “Is There A Queer Pedagogy? Or, Stop Reading Straight,” I use the term queer “to signify actions, not actors” (p. 152). While I attempt to use queer as a verb, I also use it as an adjective. I also use the acronym LGBTQ, which is still the most commonly used identifier of diverse sexual orientations and genders (used by GLSEN and much of the scholarship I read, published in the early 2000s). In my review of the literature, I take up the terminology that each author uses (for example, LGBT or GLBT).                                                 5 I am reluctant to include this section and am not confident that I adequately capture (or that I need to qualify) my use of terminology in the dissertation. However, if it helps clarify for my reader that language is ever shifting and changing, perhaps it is useful to attempt an articulation of my choices.    6  LGBTQIA*+. This term refers to people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, with an * and + added to acknowledge that language is continuing to shift and evolve to be inclusive of all sexuality and (a)gender identities. There are places in my study, and my description of the curriculum at the center of the study, where I began to use this acronym, instead of the term most commonly used by GLSEN and scholarly literature, LGBTQ (sometimes with a + added). Since one of the YA novels (None of the Above) the students read is written from the point of view of a character who is diagnosed with an intersex condition (androgen insensitivity syndrome, or AIS), it seemed important to use LGBTQIA*+, even though acronyms can be just as limiting, to acknowledge inclusion by naming intersex identities.  Queer inclusive. This term draws on Mollie Blackburn’s and J. F. Buckley’s (2005) foundational “Teaching Queer Inclusive English Language Arts,” in which they posited that inclusion of LGBTQ literature in ELA is but a beginning. Teachers must also aim to utilize queer pedagogy to “queer” the classroom, by working to destabilize heteronormativity and include multiple readings and analyses of queer content.  Gender expansive. In addition to transgender, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer, I recently learned that some trans affirmative mental health providers have begun to use the term gender expansive. Near the end of writing this dissertation, I began to include the term as a way to be inclusive of identities not captured in my use of the terms transgender or gender nonconforming. There are so many terms to describe one’s experience of gender identity (or refusal to identify as any gender), and my neglect to attempt to name all of them at the time of this writing is by no means a denial of the importance of such terminology. Within the   7  constraints of my research questions, a comprehensive review of all of the language and shifting alphabetism used to name queer identities is beyond the scope of this study.  Heteronormativity. While planning the ninth-grade curriculum at the center of this study with colleagues, we had a discussion about the key terms that would support the students’ understanding of the unit’s objectives. To this end, I found the LGBTQIA Resource Center at UC Davis6 website to be helpful. We used their definition of heteronormativity (and queer, and some other key terms not listed here7) and added parentheses after binary for clarity, to teach students about the concept in our classes:      A set of lifestyle norms, practices, and institutions that promote binary (only two) alignment of biological sex, gender identity, and gender roles; assume heterosexuality as a fundamental and natural norm; and privilege monogamous, committed relationships and reproductive sex above all other sexual practices.  Students were introduced to this (long and at times unwieldy) definition as they read multiple texts, including a selection of young adult (YA) novels, over a 6-week period. Ultimately, we focused on the first two clauses in the definition and not on the last—about monogamy and committed relationships—because in this case, it did not align with the unit’s objectives or content.  Explanation of the Study The purpose of this qualitative research was to examine what happened when ninth-grade students in a queer-friendly high school engaged in a study of queer themed YA literature in book clubs, paired with a collection of nonfiction and media that ranged from topics about rethinking gender norms in society to historical issues that have impacted people with queer identities. I collaboratively designed, planned, and taught the 6-week unit, Disrupting Dominant                                                 6 https://lgbtqia.ucdavis.edu/educated/glossary 7 We also used the UC Davis glossary to help us write definitions of queer, intersectionality, and social justice for students. For details, see Appendix B, under the heading Key Terms for the Unit.   8  Narratives and Queer Book Clubs, which came at the end of a year-long sequence of units that focused on the following themes:  ● Identity (reading and writing memoir) ● Status quo and the individual versus society (Ray Bradbury’s dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451)  ● Cultural identity, assimilation, and immigration (Jhumpa Lahiri’s Interpreter of Maladies) ● Gender roles and society’s expectations (Euripides’ ancient Greek tragedy Medea)  The culminating, summative assessment for the Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Club unit was for students to write a book review of the two YA books they read in their club, and to complete a final group project that intended to raise awareness and teach the rest of the school community about LGBTQ civil rights. This was the first time the ninth grade English course included a queer literature unit. This dissertation aimed to illuminate what happened when my teaching colleagues and I—embracing a pedagogy of love that nurtures and prizes student voice, critical reading, discussion, and humanizing classroom discourse—worked to (a) position students as queer allies, (b) teach a YA queer book club unit, and (c) understand what could be learned by analyzing their responses to and discussions about the literature. In other words, this empirical study explored an important and under-researched dimension of anti-oppressive education to the fields of English education and adolescent literacy. Because English class offers an ideal space for queer-inclusive curriculum (Clark & Blackburn, 2009), my initial questions were: ● How does reading queer themed literature reinforce or disrupt normative discourses about queer youth? ● How do students read, interpret, and analyze diverse sexualities and genders?   9  ● What happens when teachers design curriculum that intends to disrupt heteronormativity and facilitate students’ reading of YA queer literature? While writing the proposal for this dissertation, the questions evolved as I clarified my methods for collecting data and the phenomena I was hoping to examine. The final research questions are presented in Chapter III. Rationale and Significance The study of English as a discipline has been characterized by efforts to legitimize the field. In the current political climate, it seems especially relevant and important to examine the vital nature of the study of literature. The English classroom must be a culturally responsive and engaging space where literary analysis and critical literacy include contemporary works in addition to canonical works. Literature itself is not the curriculum. What the canon is, should be, and who decides has been a long-standing argument, especially among those who stand to gain the most from maintaining it as it is now – dominated by European, White, heterosexual male authors and protagonists.       ...the so-called ‘literary canon’, the unquestioned ‘great tradition’ of the ‘national literature’, has to be recognized as a construct, fashioned by particular people for particular reasons at a certain time. There is no such thing as a literary work or tradition which is valuable in itself, regardless of what anyone might have said or come to say about it. ‘Value’ is a transitive term: it means whatever is valued by certain people in specific situations, according to particular criteria and in the light of given purposes. (Eagleton, 1983, p. 10)  Even as scholars acknowledge the importance of literature study as vital, it is a problematic notion that teaching a list of canonical literature is sufficient to teach the values of a nation. Teaching literature uncritically comes at a cost.  In the 20th century, literacy scholars created the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) in response to mounting arguments in New York State about the study of literature.   10  Louise Rosenblatt revealed that reading and literacy are transactional—the relationship between the reader and the text must be considered. The reader is more important than the text itself. Words would just be ink on a page were it not for the reader to come and attach meaning to them. She further asserted that reading is not linear, but an event. The reader brings more than a literal understanding of the words to a text, but also a “whole body of cultural assumptions, practical knowledge, awareness of literary conventions, readiness to think and feel” (Rosenblatt, 1994, p. 88). The sociocultural approach to language and literacy began as a counter to autonomous models of literacy, and as a way to challenge and disrupt the notion that the reading process is linear.  There continues to be a growing body of research on sociocultural approaches to literacy in the field of English education and literacy studies. Deborah Appleman argued that literary theory must be taught in secondary schools, and English teachers have a responsibility to do so. To those who might say teaching English should not be political, she reminded us that there is no such thing as a neutral reading of texts. She warned that to uncritically teach The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn or To Kill a Mockingbird because they are classic pieces of literature without regard for the problems engendered by the use of the “n” word would privilege the arbitrary literary value of a canonical text over the significance and relevance of the history of racism and the devaluing of African American lives in the United States. It ignores the deeply politicized and violent history of the “n” word, in particular how it conjures up a legacy of hatred and marginalization of African Americans. In other words, we must not teach to transmit knowledge or teach literature as content, but to frame reading as an opportunity to view the world critcally through a variety of lenses (Appleman, 2007).   11  A central aim of this dissertation research was to examine what happens when students engage in a study of YA queer literature and what that can contribute to a growing body of research that suggests that unlearning homophobia and heteronormativity is possible in ELA classes that teach a queer-inclusive curriculum. Since few empirical studies have examined what happens in classrooms that study YA literature and fewer still have explored queer-themed YA literature, this research sought to fill a gap in the field of adolescent literacy by putting student learning and practitioner knowledge at the center. Another goal was to reveal the “transformative possibilities for literacy” (Blackburn & Schey, 2018, p. 337) when youth see themselves in “queerly responsive” (Brockenbrough, 2014) literature. In Chapter II, through a review of the existing literature on queer pedagogy, cultural relevance, critical (queer) literacy, and empathy, I attempt to theorize that critical humanizing pedagogy that privileges youth voice and queer inclusive curricula can support adolescents as they interrogate and reimagine the(ir) world(s).    11  Chapter II  LITERATURE REVIEW  Introduction       To open our hearts more fully to love’s power and grace we must dare to acknowledge how little we know of love in both theory and practice…. We yearn to end the lovelessness that is so pervasive in our society. (hooks, 2001, p. xxix)  Much of the research I identified on teaching that addresses diverse sexualities and genders in ELA classrooms offers a clear rationale for why this pedagogical practice—queer-inclusive curriculum and teaching that aims to disrupt heteronormativity—is vital and relevant to English education. A review of the literature revealed that further research on English teachers who use queer-inclusive curricula and LGBTQIA*+ literature in secondary schools is needed because most schools are heteronormative institutions that reject or avoid such teaching. Even though the NCTE Resolution on Strengthening Teacher Knowledge of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Issues (2007)1 urged teacher preparation programs to require the inclusion of LGBT issues, many state certification requirements do not require such training. This, coupled with the fact that LGBT people do not have enumerated civil rights protections in America (such as employment, housing, healthcare, and education), reveals an alarming state of affairs. Review of Relevant Literature The following themes emerged in my initial review of the literature on the inclusion of LGBT and queer-inclusive curricula: oppression as it operates in schools and curricula; unpacking dichotomous notions of gender and sexuality; disrupting heterosexism and homophobia; the role of adolescent literacy; the distinctions between LGBT inclusive and queer                                                 1 http://www2.ncte.org/statement/teacherknowledgelgbt/   12  inclusive; establishing criteria for selection and pedagogical implications of teaching LGBT literature; and the urgency of cultural relevance.  In my initial review of the literature, I used the following search terms: (a) Teaching LGBT literature, (b) Queer-inclusive literature, (c) English teachers and LGBT literature, and  (d) Queer literature. After analyzing my findings, I also searched: (a) Teaching empathy with YA fiction, (b) Reading and empathy in YA fiction, (c) Developing empathy through queer YA literature, and (d) Critical queer literacy. Queer Pedagogy Queer pedagogy calls into question teaching practices that are oppressive and dehumanizing and explores the possibilities of a critical pedagogy informed by queer theory.  I would like to suggest an expansive notion of queer pedagogy that includes queer-inclusive  ELA teaching, anti-oppressive education, cultural relevance, and love. I thought about the convergence of all of these themes as I read bell hooks (2001). While hooks is not a queer theorist, her description of the radical possibilities of embracing a love ethic, one which cannot coexist with a drive for domination or power, thematically articulates the application of queer pedagogy that I am proposing.  A love ethic presupposes that everyone has the right to be free, to live fully and well. To bring a love ethic to every dimension of our lives, our society would need to embrace change. (p. 87)  hooks (2001) offered a hopeful vision of what is possible if society can cast aside the fear of change—as a necessary disruption to a status quo that thrives on collective fear to ensure obedience. Fear creates a need for safety and people find safety in sameness and separation, therefore making difference a threat. Embracing a love ethic includes creating awareness and a willingness to learn, to examine our actions critically (p. 94). So a this would be pedagogy that is   13  thereby queer for its ethos of love, inclusion, freedom from oppression, and rejection of difference as deficient. Theoretical understandings of oppression in schools and curricula. To begin, it is important to examine queer literature studies in a theoretical context to understand its controversial nature in schools and education. Asher (2007) posited that teachers need support to work with their students to unpack the differences of sexuality, race, culture, and gender, and that by studying difference, educators promote equity. She suggested that a rejection of difference has an impact on multicultural discourse and practice. Britzman (1995) also encouraged a universalizing discourse—which is one that acknowledges that all bodies matter. Like Asher, she argued that learning about difference has the power to transform racist, sexist, and heterosexist attitudes. Difference is an important construct when it comes to examining education’s resistance to challenging heterosexism in the curriculum and schools and in society. If heteronormativity is not explored—along with racism and sexism—then dominant modes of oppression remain intact. It is useful to study queer theory and other theories that explore difference to better understand why teaching queer literature can be overwhelming for practitioners and why its relevance is a source of contention. If it is seen as an optional addition to the existing ELA curriculum, this makes it easier to cast aside as being too difficult or not a priority. Griffin and Ouellett (2003) document/ed three historical eras to reflect historical shifts in the ways that LGBTQ persons are viewed in K-12 schools. They illuminated some disturbing aspects of past education policy that was designed to portray homosexual educators as a threat to children and to democracy. They also provided information about the origin of the Safe Schools movement that originated in the 1990s. The movement was created to protect LGBTQ students   14  as it became clear that violence and homophobia were on the rise and that such incidents have no place in schools—which are supposed to be safe havens for all human beings, regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. An examination of these shifts in perspective over the past 40 years is vital to disrupting status quo notions of heteronormativity and to better support LGBTQ students and educators. One of the issues Blackburn (2012) discussed was the pitfalls of what she called the “protect-and-punish” approach that many U.S. schools take to combat homophobia. There were six suicides of gay youth in September 2010. Six. In one month (McKinley, 2010). The media’s emphasis on portraying these young people as victims of bullying and downplaying homophobia unwittingly contributes to constructions of gay people that harken back to the 1970s—which emphasize gay people as victims who need protection from bullies. The focus should have been on the systemic problem of homophobia and what must be done to address it, and not on bullies which places the responsibility on individuals. Blackburn (2012) revealed that attempting to safeguard some students by alienating others has devastating consequences for those who are queer or are questioning their identities.      It is no wonder, then, that LGBTQ*+ kids feel like they don’t belong in schools and that many students work hard to stay away from all things understood to be queer. It is no wonder that schools are typically homophobic institutions. (p. 3)  Snapp, Mcguire, Sinclair, Gabrion, and Russell (2015) believed that LGBTQ inclusive and supportive curricula are mainly effective when they “reach a critical mass within a school” (p. 590). The authors suggested that inclusion in health and physical education classes is essential and that such teaching was largely absent and contributed to homophobia. Further research is needed even in California, where the study was conducted. California adopted the   15  FAIR Education Act in 2011 which requires that “teachers include factual and positive information about LGBTQ people in social studies and history” (p. 592). Kevin Kumashiro (2000) summarized and critiqued the four primary approaches (education for the Other, education about the Other, education that is critical of privileging and Othering, and education that changes students and society) that educational researchers have employed to arrive at the nature of oppression and the curricula and pedagogies needed to bring about change. Kumashiro argued for a broader conceptualization of “the dynamics of oppression, the processes of teaching and learning, and even the purposes of schooling...when working against the many forms of social oppression that play out in the lives of students” (p. 25). In addition, there must be a combination of the four primary approaches to improve the experiences of students who are “Othered”—a term Kumashiro used in reference to those groups that are traditionally marginalized in society, i.e., that are other than the norm, such as students of color, students from under- or unemployed families, students who are female, or male but not stereotypically ‘masculine,’ and students who are, or are perceived to be, queer. (p. 26)  Inclusion is not enough: Disrupting problematic readings of queer content. Clark and Blackburn (2009) asserted that English classrooms can be the ideal place to combat homophobia and heterosexism in schools and that reading LGBTQ-themed literature is one of the best ways to do so (p. 25). Despite resistance, such work is happening, and the authors’ goals are not only to document it but also to explore the possibilities for praxis in schools. Scholars have argued for queer-inclusive K-12 ELA courses (Blackburn & Buckley, 2005). However, they “don’t provide concrete images of practice that novice teachers, especially, may need to gauge the possibilities for using LGBT-themed literature in their work” (Clark & Blackburn, 2009, p. 26).   16  There is a limited body of research that has documented readings of LGBT-themed literature in English classrooms. These studies reveal/ed that reading LGBT-themed literature does and should happen in schools. But they are also problematic in part because of the context of schools, which are institutions that are traditionally and historically heteronormative and thereby resistant to including themes that acknowledge same-sex desire. Clark and Blackburn (2009) further suggested that teachers refuse to position students as homophobes to ensure that heteronormativity, which is pervasive in classrooms, is disrupted and to challenge students to rise to the occasion of supporting LGBT rights and people (p. 28). It also matters how often LGBT-themed literature is positioned in the curriculum—and that it is not a single event, text, or unit. Positioning texts as windows or mirrors (Bishop, 1992) is also essential and achieved when a wide range of LGBT-themed literature is read across the year. Pleasure is also an important consideration—the availability of YA literature and student choice can improve the experience of reading and discussing a text.      If LGBT-themed literature were read throughout the school year in relationship to a variety of topics and units, then it would disrupt the notion of what is normal, at least in the context of the classroom in which it was being studied. (Clark & Blackburn, 2009,  p. 29)  Blackburn and Clark (2011) examined the transcripts of the talk that 32 adolescents and adults, all of whom identified as LGBTQ or their allies with a shared commitment to fighting homophobia, engaged in reading about 24 texts over the course of 3 years. The goal of the paper was to identify the kind of talk that was used and “the ways it was liberatory and/or oppressive” (p. 222). A Foucaultian analysis was used in an attempt to identify places where the talk was LGBT inclusive and queer inclusive. The theoretical framework of the discourse analysis was aligned with a queering approach (rather than LGBT inclusive), which comes out of queer theory and new literacy studies as “they both understand the significance of social, cultural, and   17  political dynamics” (p. 224). The focus of the authors was to use what queer theorist Judith Butler (1999) called the “heterosexual matrix” to examine the rules imposed on people by society. Atkinson and DePalma (2009) suggested that “through naming and believing the heterosexual matrix (Butler, 1990) and identifying evidence of its operation, we reify, reinforce and reinscribe it, even as we attempt to subvert, unsettle or deconstruct it” (p. 17). Butler realized the problem associated with the metaphor of the matrix and instead used the term heterosexual hegemony when she wrote Bodies That Matter (1993). It was too late because “heterosexual matrix” had already been used within feminist and queer theory analyses as a powerful tool for framing theoretical understandings. The problem with the term heterosexual matrix is that it “doesn’t immediately suggest a way of calling it out of being” (Atkinson & DePalma, 2009,  p. 18). Heterosexual hegemony, on the other hand, “is a collective process, that it requires constant construction, and that it can’t exist once we withdraw consent” (p. 18). Atkinson and DePalma preferred Butler’s revised notion of hegemony because it can be disorganized through what they called queering consensual heteronormativity. A relevant example from the YA book Totally Joe was cited, although fictional, as revealing how “heteronormativity operates in relation to both presence and absence—both doing straight and not doing gay” (p. 20). Their findings offered that opportunities begin when teachers reflect and critically analyze their current school discourses and their unconscious participation in them. DePalma (2013) studied the U.K.-based No Outsiders research team as they embarked on a participatory action project to study LGBT equalities in primary schools. Their work was guided by two questions:  1. How can primary teachers challenge heteronormativity implicit in school environments and educational practices?   18  2. How can the development of a research-based community of practice empower primary teachers to challenge this heteronormativity? (p. 4)  The team committed to going “beyond simple notions of creating safe spaces to a deeper interrogation of implicit [gender] norms and how far [they] might be willing and able to disrupt them” (p. 5). With this in mind, DePalma suggested implementing trans-inclusive curriculum in primary school since that is where the conflation of sex-gender and sexuality is a presumed truth. As a result, DePalma proposed a trans-ing curriculum, to question categories and norms about gender instead of imposing “discourses of tolerance and equality over certainties that can be incompatible and counterproductive” (p. 13). Helmer (2015) found that queer-themed literature curriculum disrupts the heteronormative space of school and opens new thinking for understanding diverse genders and sexualities. “The conceptual tools that queer theory offers can promote pedagogical shifts that will allow teachers and students to engage with diverse sexualities and genders in new and productive ways, opening up new lines of thinking and understanding” (p. 35). Helmer studied a high school English course for eleventh- and twelfth-grade students in New England titled Gay and Lesbian Literature in which “queer moments surfaced as [high school] students engaged with queer texts” (p. 36). Since it matters how teachers engage students with such literature, critical literacy and queer theory can be especially useful. The qualitative ethnographic case study focused on the work of an out lesbian 15-year veteran teacher who had been teaching the course since she developed it in 2002. The school already had African American Literature and Women in Literature courses, so she designed Gay and Lesbian Literature as a literary journey from the early 1900s to the 1990s. She selected four novels of literary merit paired with documentaries, movies, magazine articles, and internet sources. Students engaged in “deconstructive reading practices” (p. 40), then applied those same practices to the texts and   19  media they encountered every day. She used an intertextual approach and a historical approach to highlight shifts in LGBTQ representation in texts. Students learned about internalized homophobia, heterosexism, and heteronormativity. Staley and Leonardi (2016) used the term GSD, or gender and sexual diversity (Meyer, 2010), in their study of what happened when the authors (doctoral students at the time of the study) taught a university-based literacy methods course for preservice secondary literacy teachers, to prepare them for teaching GSD-inclusive teaching. Using Kumashiro’s (2001) framework for anti-oppressive education, Staley and Leonardi (2016) explored how the methods curriculum put many of their students in a state of emotional crisis and found that those who were willing to lean into their discomfort positioned themselves to be advocates for queer youth. Most secondary schools are heteronormative institutions that fail to critique the ways in which GSD is presented (or more commonly, absent) in the curriculum. Scholars have shown what is possible in literacy curriculum, but cautioned that unless heterosexism and heteronormativity are unpacked and unlearned, queer content will be presented problematically (Blackburn & Buckley, 2005). Instead, educators must present queer content in ways that affirm queer identities while also challenging hetero and gender normative practices.  Kumashiro (2001) defined oppression as the repetition of dominant identities and forms of knowledge in social practice. To work against this kind of oppression, Kumashiro suggested critical reading practices that engage students in examining the extent to which a story reproduces or challenges stereotypes about queer youth, and which aspects of queer youths’ lives are left silent (p. 7). Establishing criteria for the selection of LGBT literature. Cart and Jenkins (2006) believed in the importance and value of school library collections that have a balance of   20  literature featuring positive portrayals of GLBTQ2 characters and themes in fiction for lesbian and gay teens. It was their goal to document the evolution of the field and to identify titles that are notable for their excellence or their failures. The framework they used to analyze the literature they recommended for inclusion in libraries was modeled on R. Sims Bishop’s (1982) foundational study Shadow & Substance: Afro-American Experience in Contemporary Children’s Fiction. Cart and Jenkins designed a three-part model specific to GLBTQ content  in YA fiction using category descriptors that reflected post-Stonewall GLBTQ history.  The categories were: (a) Homosexual visibility, (b) Gay assimilation, and (c) Queer consciousness/community. Their work continues to be a valuable resource for English teachers who are looking for titles that will address culturally relevant, inclusive pedagogy in their classrooms. Logan, Lasswell, Hood, and Watson (2014) found that since 1996, more than 200 novels centering on queer characters have been published (Wickens, 2011). A number of studies model how K-12 educators can make use of queer literature (Blackburn & Buckley; Clark & Blackburn; Crocco; Schall & Kauffman). Logan et al. touched on cultural relevance when they suggested that while “there is still apprehension about using YA queer literature in schools, there are many educators who choose to mirror the society we live in by selecting texts that convey diversity and multiple identities” (p. 31). Teachers need a framework for making the best YA queer literature choices and Logan et al. suggested using a variation of Cart and Jenkins’ framework in their foundational study. In order to choose novels that center on queer consciousness/community, the authors offered nine criteria: curriculum relevance; literary merit; windows and mirrors; social justice and equity; stereotypes; pride, resiliency, and self-actualization; sexual expressiveness;                                                 2 The authors use the term GLBTQ to reflect the origins of the gay rights or gay liberation movement that began with the 1969 Stonewall Riots.   21  inclusion and diversity; and offsetting heterosexism and homophobia/challenging heteronormativity. They concluded with a rationale for curriculum inclusion and believed that doing so requires teachers to challenge their attitudes about heterosexism, homophobia, and transphobia. They emphasized that the students must also be positioned as queer or straight allies (Clark & Blackburn, 2009) and that doing so promotes critical literacy. Pedagogical implications for teaching LGBTQ literature. Many of the authors I read on this topic hold the belief that literature means more to readers when they see themselves reflected in a text. As English teachers, this finding should have a profound impact on the ways that curricula are designed and implemented, but Blackburn and Buckley (2005) found that this is not the case. They used a random stratified sampling of 600 U.S. public high schools, listed in the 2002 U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and contacted by mail the persons responsible for the development of the ELA curriculum. They asked whether their curricula included materials that addressed same-sex desire, and if so, which materials were used. Two hundred and twelve schools responded, and of those, only 18 (or 8.49%) said that they used texts, films, or other materials addressing same-sex desire in their ELA curriculum (p. 205). Much of ELA curricula explores who is an insider and who is an outsider and which narratives find an audience and which are silenced. This has implications for English teachers who are concerned with interrupting homophobia and heterosexism. Blackburn and Buckley offered ways that teachers can incorporate queer-inclusive curricula, and prove that doing so is vital in a contemporary society that values the power of language.  Scholars and teacher educators have urged ELA teachers to develop an LGBT-inclusive curriculum, and several articles published have offered suggestions for the selection of such   22  literature. Doing so actively works to counter homophobia and heterosexism in schools (Clark & Blackburn, 2009). Scholars have also discovered that LGBT-themed literature and texts are rarely included, despite findings that revealed the benefits of doing so. Studies of teacher attitudes toward addressing LGBT themes in their language arts classrooms have suggested that teachers’ conflicting beliefs about these issues are part of the reason for their absence in curricula. Thein (2013) examined the reasons teachers resist and offered teacher educators ways to strategize supporting teachers to do the crucial work of teaching LGBT texts and issues. She cited Clark (2010), who documented the difference between teachers who claim a neutral stance limit themselves to interrupting homophobia or heterosexist discourse on the part of individual students (or as she called it, “anti-work”) and “ally work” which “involves inviting critical dialogue about homophobia and heteronormativity” (p. 169) in an effort to promote institutional change. According to Thein (2013):      The seeming neutrality of an anti-stance toward homophobia and heteronormativity bears a resemblance to a “color-blind” stance toward racism, as theorized by Bonilla-Silva and Forman (2000). This theory is driven by discrepancies between research indicating that contemporary white Americans’ attitudes have become less racist in recent years (Schuman, Steeh, & Bobo, 1988) and research finding that whites do not support racial justice in areas such as crime, welfare, and affirmative action (Terkel, 1993). In their work, Bonilla-Silva and Forman ask ‘How can whites claim to believe in racial equality and yet oppose programs to reduce inequality?’ (p. 170)  While Thein (2013) did not want to equate racism with a reluctance to teach LGBT issues and texts, it may be useful to examine the “discursive similarities between the two stances”  (p. 170) by drawing on Bonilla-Silva and Forman’s framework and methods. Thein studied 20 current and preservice language arts teachers who were sympathetic to LGBT students and issues but were unwilling to teach such issues in their classes. Participants were enrolled in a Master’s-level online course on multicultural literature instruction at a major research university during   23  the eighth week of the course, which was focused on LGBT texts. The course texts for that week included The Laramie Project (Kaufman, 2001) and two articles on the value of teaching LGBT-themed texts (Clark & Blackburn, 2009; Curwood, Schliesman, & Horning, 2009). Data were coded using methods from Bonilla-Silva and Forman’s (2000) analysis of college students’ statements pertaining to their views on race and affirmative action. The first stage of coding revealed the majority of claims were negative, or that LGBT themes should not or could not be taught in classrooms, even though some had positive views of LGBT people and issues in general.  There are many ways the English curriculum silences LGBT people, and teachers need to know how to go about changing the curriculum to be more inclusive, and which texts warrant consideration, according to Curwood et al. (2009). Curwood, a doctoral student and former high school English teacher, asserted that the inclusion of books with LGBTQ themes creates a safe space for all students. She also cited Smith (1994) and Allan (1999), who argued that sexual orientation and gender variance should be considered aspects of diversity, and that multicultural refers to more than racial, cultural, and ethnic diversity. Curwood et al. discussed the barriers teachers face in choosing literature for their classrooms, and that they must choose books reflecting LGBTQ experience—that to do otherwise would be a form of censorship. Curwood et al. (2009) said, “But one of the first steps every educator can take is to acknowledge that books with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning characters aren’t about ‘the other,’ they’re about us—all of us” (p. 39). They added that there are ways to get around perceived or real limitations imposed by departmental, institutional, district guidelines and this includes NCTE censorship resources.3 Horning provided an annotated bibliography of LGBTQ young adult novels for use in middle school and high school classrooms. She mentioned that they paid                                                 3 http://www2.ncte.org/statement/censorshipofnonprint/   24  particular attention to diversity because many of the most popular LGBTQ YA novels published in the past decade have included White, middle-class, gay male characters. Snapp, Burdge, Licona, Moody, and Russell (2015) used grounded theory and a social justice perspective to study 26 high school students in California who shared their experiences of LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum in school. Their data revealed that inclusive curriculum most often translated to standalone lessons in humanities courses. Also, this curriculum rarely met standards of social justice education, even though it provides the potential for engagement in critical discourse around systemic oppression. These authors posited the “systematic exclusion of positive information about LGBTQ people in schools is likely related to discriminatory practices” (p. 251). Snapp et al. argued for five school-level strategies that place the responsibility on schools (not solely teachers and their students) to make changes: 1. inclusive anti-harassment policies, 2. teacher support, 3. supportive extracurricular options including clubs (like GSAs), 4. access to information and support related to gender identity and sexual orientation, 5. LGBTQ inclusive curriculum. (p. 250)  Daniel (2007) focused on the necessity for teachers to create safe schools by challenging homophobic language and slurs, using inclusive language and materials, and providing literature that depicts gay and lesbian characters. The author made the compelling argument in the face of recent suicides among gay teens and cited Remafedi (1994), who stated that gay and lesbian youth are two to six times more likely to attempt suicide than other youth and may account for 30% of successful suicides among adolescents. Establishing a trusting climate in the classroom is just as essential as including gay and lesbian literature, and the author wrote more extensively about the former than the latter. In her conclusion, she cautioned that ignoring gay and lesbian voices in literature can be seen as expecting gay or lesbian students to deny their sexual   25  orientation. This article did not, however, address that there are ever-expanding gender and sexual orientation identities which must also be included.  Sumara (1993) stated the position that, while educators are concerned about issues of inequity, many still ignore and are silent about homophobia that is pervasive in schools, and that a way to counter it is through including literature in English curricula and school libraries that feature gay and lesbian themes and characters. This very act will reduce homophobia and raise consciousness that social change is needed. While educators are concerned about issues of inequity, many still ignore and are silent about heterosexist ideals reinforced in schools. A way to combat this is through including literature in English curricula and school libraries that feature gay and lesbian themes and characters (p. 34). Not including LGBT voices in literature is a form of silencing, which is destructive to public education and, thus, to democracy. Sumara also cautioned that silencing voices has devastating effects on gay and lesbian youth, who deserve a safe passage to discover who they are. It is crucial that they also see themselves reflected in the stories we ask them to read in our classrooms. Gonzales (2010) identified the risks and threats in taking on an anti-oppression stance as a first-year teacher, both in his decision to teach LGBT-inclusive text and leading the school’s gay-straight alliance (GSA). He cited Fecho (2001) who used threat to describe “when teachers shy away from controversy in the classroom, parents ask for changes in their children’s curriculum, or students construct a new sense of their worldview, some aspect of their lives has come under some degree of threat” (p. 30). The author faced real and imagined threats from authority as he embarked on being an ally teacher working to be an advocate for LGBTQ people. But he also learned that not being prepared for the ways that literacy events posed as threats to the students was also an impediment to being an ally.   26  Culturally Relevant Teaching Ladson-Billings (1995) argued for teaching that puts cultural relevance at the forefront as a way to ensure academic excellence for African American students, and other students who have not been served by our nation’s public schools. She discussed the theoretical grounding of culturally relevant teaching in the context of a 3-year study of eight successful teachers of African American students. The shared characteristics of these teachers were how they thought about themselves as teachers and how they thought about others (their students, the students’ parents, and other community members), how they structured social relations within and outside the classroom, and how they conceived knowledge (p. 163). In addition, all of the participating teachers identified strongly with teaching, were not dependent on state curriculum frameworks or textbooks to decide what and how to teach, and were passionate about what they were teaching. Ladson-Billings (1992) defined culturally relevant teaching as a pedagogy of opposition that rests on three criteria: (a) students must experience academic success; (b) students must develop and/or maintain cultural competence; and (c) students must develop a critical consciousness through which they can challenge the status quo of the current social order  (p. 160). Culturally relevant teaching means that students must develop a broader sociopolitical consciousness that allows them to critique social norms, values, mores, and institutions that produce and maintain social inequities (p. 162). The exclusion of literature that contains LGBTQIA+ characters and themes deprives all students of an opportunity to challenge the status quo and denies that LGBTQ persons are visible and valuable citizens. ELA curricula that engage students in discussions that counter heterosexist and homophobic ideas will lead to cultural competence, as some in our society attempt to put the rights and experiences of LGBTQ persons into the spotlight where it belongs.   27  Multiculturalism. Bishop (1992) asserted that the books selected to be read in school are of great importance, especially as pertaining to social justice and equity because “multicultural literature” refers to “literature by and about people who are members of groups considered to be outside the socio-political mainstream of the United States” (p. 39). When teachers choose which stories will be read in their classrooms, they must feature multicultural literature that positively portrays the lives and experiences of people of color. It is also essential for teachers to include books that are authored by people of color, as opposed to books by White authors that feature people of color because of the potential for flaws, inaccurate representations of their experiences and a lack of cultural authenticity. The author cited a survey and analysis of 150 fictional books published between 1965 and 1979 (Sims, 1982) that revealed a majority of the fiction about African Americans was being created by White authors. In schools, concerns about cultural authenticity are related to the selection of multicultural literature because of its intention to offer insight into the human experience. Bishop (1992) cited African American children’s book author Elizabeth Fitzgerald Howard (1991) who suggested teachers ...must also aim for that authentic body of literature for children which can lead us toward our goals: self-esteem for those previously not reflected in the mirror, and important enlightenment for those who, for too long, have seen only themselves in that mirror; all leading toward the celebration of living in the multicultural society. (p. 43)  The stories selected by teachers have ramifications for their students. Bishop suggested strategies that educators can use in making such choices so that teachers are better informed about how to select and evaluate multicultural literature. These include reading extensively in literature written by insiders, choosing a balanced collection, selecting books carefully—with an eye on characterization, language, illustrations, accuracy—and considering possible effect on a child’s self-esteem.   28  (Queer) windows and mirrors. Greenbaum (1994) argued that students need a balanced view of literature—gay and lesbian students need mirrors (Bishop, 1992) and straight students need to “see that there are many ways to be sexual in the world” (Greenbaum, 1994, p. 71). They can do this by learning to explore homoerotic subtexts in canonical and contemporary literature. Since everyone is presumed straight and “invisibility hurts gay and lesbian people” (p. 71), this work is of great urgency to the author, an out lesbian high school teacher. “Heterosexuality comes up in discussion all the time: love, sex, and family dynamics tend to be literary subject-matter, worthy of taking a thesis on, writing a story about, or discussing in class” (p. 74). Greenbaum, citing Bishop, brought into sharp focus that queer content must be included so that queer people are not excluded from being represented in curricula. Montgomery (2001) provided guidelines for creating culturally responsive, inclusive classrooms and suggested the work begins with teachers assessing and reflecting on their own beliefs and practices, since “many teachers are faced with limited understanding of cultures other than their own and the possibility that this limitation will negatively affect their students’ ability to become successful learners” (p. 4).  Montgomery’s work might not be useful for my research on how and why teachers use LGBTQ literature in their ELA classes. He emphasized collaboration with families, but for those who are LGBTQ and might not be out to their family or have their support, that would not be feasible. Kumashiro would call some of Montgomery’s suggestions into question regarding the othering of people; for example, creating a bulletin board that displays activities and events focused on people of color and student-made posters depicting culturally relevant historical events, poems, and stories done without the proper social justice frameworks could tokenize and further marginalize people of color.     29  There is a dearth of research on pedagogical strategies that can make a difference in the lives of queer youth of color. Brockenbrough (2014) described an ethnographic study of an HIV/AIDS prevention and supports center’s culturally responsive pedagogical work with Black and Latino urban queer youth (BLUQY) and implications for educators to engage this particular population in a culturally responsive manner. Since much of the work promoting anti-bullying educational policymaking and safe schools has taken off in the last decade, it falls short of addressing urban queer youth of color “whose multiple marginalized positionalities in urban social and educational contexts force them to contend with complex intersections of oppressions that cannot be fully remedied by safe spaces focused solely on combating homophobia” (p. 171; also see Blackburn & McCready, 2009; Wright, 2008). Although the author of this paper situated this study in an out-of-school space, it offers insights into other spaces that serve BLUQY.  Critical (Queer) Literacies  Engagement in literacy instruction is critical—it must capture adolescents’ minds and speak to the questions they have about the world as they contemplate their place within it. It must allow them to interact with intellectually challenging content, even as it sharpens their ability to derive meaning from texts (Jacobs, 2012). One of the most critical ways to engage students in the English curriculum is by choosing literature that speaks to their lives and values their out-of-school interests and experiences. Using a multicultural collection of literature is especially relevant. Literature means more to readers when they see themselves reflected in the text (Blackburn & Buckley, 2005; Sims, 1982). For English teachers, this should have a profound impact on the ways that curricula are designed and implemented, but Blackburn and Buckley (2005) found that this was not the case. They surveyed a random stratified sampling of 600 U.S. public high schools to determine whether their ELA curricula included materials that addressed   30  same-sex desire, and if so, which materials were used. Two hundred twelve schools responded, and of those, only 18 (or 8.49%) said that they used texts, films, or other materials addressing same-sex desire in their ELA curriculum. This is problematic considering that the narratives that find an audience and those that are silenced have implications for English teachers who are concerned with interrupting oppression.  The distinctions between LGBT inclusive and queer inclusive. Most schools do not yet make LGBT literature available to students, so Blackburn, Clark, and Nemeth (2015) initiated an out-of-school reading group with LGBTQ and allied youth and their teachers. They read 24 books over the course of 3 years and the talk that occurred in their book discussion group was analyzed (Blackburn & Clark, 2011). The authors posited that LGBT-inclusive discourses often reinforce heteronormativity and binary constructions of sex and gender. Because of this, LGBT-inclusive discourses may only provide a “sentimental education” (Britzman, 1995, p. 12) that insists gay and lesbian people are just like straight people and erases significant differences.  Queer is not the LGBT lumped together, but instead the suspension of those categories. Poststructural rejects essentialist and developmental approaches and posits there is no assumed true identity (Blackburn et al., 2015, p. 15). Blackburn et al. worked to understand whether, in queer literature, characters’ sexual and gender identities were portrayed as “essential” or as something more complex. Using queer theory and Lesko’s (2012) conceptualization of adolescence as lenses, growth and change are recursive and not limited to adolescence. People can hold “opposing identities simultaneously” (p. 197), so Lesko argued for “concrete practices in which youth demand and exercise adultlike responsibility” (p. 199). Literary elements were another lens authors used to create a book analysis tool to narrow down to five focal texts.    31  Queer literature as a category differs from LGBT-themed literature because it offers “multiple and conflicting ideologies related to sexuality and gender” (Blackburn et al., 2015,  p. 24) and by reading queer literature, young people encounter characters or narratives that challenge dominant normative ideologies (p. 43). The authors hoped this analysis gives teachers impetus to take up queer pedagogy and avoid unintentionally reinforcing heteronormativity. Blackburn and Smith (2010) participated in a teacher inquiry group, self-named the Pink TIGers, with a focus on combating heterosexism through the use of literature and film. The first years of meetings reflected, on the part of the straight allies who were part of the group, that few realized the extent to which homophobia and their complicity in it had invaded their consciousness. Combating homophobia by using LGBTQ-themed texts seemed to accomplish the work they set out to do. But they found two problems with the approach: heteronormativity and intersectionality (p. 625).  Blackburn and Smith (2010) focused on adolescents and adults engaging in literacy practices in both in-school and out-of-school contexts. They found that heteronormativity goes unchecked because it is so prevalent. Schools unwittingly enforce heteronormativity through the establishment of rigid gender roles (p. 627), which are used to inform heteronormative school cultures, curricula, and policies. Moreover, it starts at the beginning of schooling. Teachers who enforce heteronormativity do so at the expense of LGBT students. Recent scholarship has been critiqued for privileging one category of difference above others, so there have been calls for increased attention to intersectionality. The intersectionality of various “social and cultural categories of identity and oppression” (Blackburn & McCready, 2009) must shape curricula and teacher training efforts. Also, Hancock (2007) studied the necessity for research that attends to intersecting categories of difference. Kumashiro (2001)   32  contended that examining intersections serves to trouble the ways that oppression and identity are currently understood. Sexuality cannot be separated from a person’s race, gender, class, and other identity markers because no one is solely sexual. In light of this, the authors concluded that it is essential for teachers to add to the effort of LGBTQ inclusivity by combatting heteronormativity and considering intersectionality. Unpacking dichotomous notions of gender and sexuality. Blackburn (2005) troubled dichotomous notions of gender and sexuality. While Blackburn acknowledged that using terminology is considered in itself reifying dichotomies, her rationale was important: “...if I refused to use words such as female and male, feminine and masculine, gay and straight, I would fail to capture the ways in which gender and sexuality are often interpreted by those who experience gender dichotomously and imposed on those who don’t (indeed, on all of us)”  (p. 400). Blackburn used the terms femininity and masculinity “to describe behaviors typically associated with women and men respectively. These behaviors signify gender but are not, necessarily synonymous with gender. I use female-ness and male-ness to describe...performances of gender” (p. 401). Blackburn (2005) cited Butler (1999) to deconstruct the notion of gender as dichotomous because when scholars “accept dichotomous notions of gender, they dismiss the experiences of queer people” (p. 403). This essay also served to “challenge literacy scholars, perhaps many of whom have rejected dichotomous notions of literacy for broader notions of literacies and texts, to reject dichotomous notions of gender and sexuality, in favor of a more inclusive conception of who are students are and can be” (p. 403).  Blackburn and her partner (2005) created a literacy group called Story Time at the Attic, a youth center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She highlighted the first meeting of this group “in   33  which gender play in the text, the reading of the text, and the lives of the participating youths were quite prominent” (p. 404). Over the 3 years, the researchers got to know Katrina, a young African American male-to-female transgender person, who performed femininity and female-ness and was romantically involved with men. She physically presented herself as a straight feminine woman, but in one meeting referred to herself as a bisexual or gay man, revealing Katrina lives a life in which gender is multiple and fluid (p. 404). Blackburn also wrote a compelling portrait of Trey—a young African American gay man who was out at home but not yet at school. Over the 3 years that the author knew him, she saw him perform masculinity and at other times femininity, but only saw him perform male-ness—thus revealing Trey lives a life in which gender is rhizomatic; that is, he is a male who is confined neither to masculinity or femininity. Blackburn asserted that Katrina’s and Trey’s gender performances reveal the fictional nature of dichotomous notions of gender. Choosing texts that will lead students and teachers to engage in discussions about gender and disruption of the male-female binary need to happen from the beginning of schooling (Rice, 2002). Rice (2000) found that when she taught Oliver Button is a Sissy (dePaolo, 1979) in a third-grade classroom, some problematic responses reified heteronormative assumptions about boys and gender performance. Moreover, Judith Butler (1990) promoted making “gender trouble” and thinking through the “possibility of subverting and displacing those naturalized and reified notions of gender that support masculine hegemony and heterosexist power” (p. 44). Furthermore, dichotomizing gender and sexuality perpetuate sexism, heterosexism, homophobia, and transphobia, causing great harm not only to queer people but to all. Teachers have the opportunity to counter violence by disrupting dichotomies, making safe places for LGBTQ youth   34  in their queer-friendly classrooms, and rejecting the reification of categories designed to perpetuate inequality. Blackburn (2006) later wrote that a shortcoming of her “Disrupting Dichotomies…” article was that it did not provide the how for teachers to combat misogyny, homophobia, transphobia in classrooms. To create the context for gender trouble to be possible in a classroom without violent consequences, “we need to recognize our own prejudices against LGBTQ people and reflect on the ways that these prejudices impact our teaching of LGBTQ and gender nonconforming students” (p. 264). The notion that teacher preparation programs largely exclude queer-inclusive pedagogy and anti-oppression work makes Blackburn’s suggestion even more urgent. It should be a requirement for teacher training and graduate programs to address systematic oppression and teaching methods that ensure preservice teachers do not carry discrimination into their classrooms.  Blackburn (2006) also suggested that teachers make their support for LGBTQ students visible by posting visual cues to promote safety and inclusion such as pamphlets, resource guides, and stickers with pink triangles and rainbows in their classrooms. Teaching LGBTQ-inclusive texts and not avoiding but approaching topics of sexual orientation and gender identity with care are crucial. Teachers have a responsibility to make classrooms safe for all students, including gender nonconforming and LGBTQ students. Blackburn argued that this work must be done to create an environment where students can make gender trouble without violent consequences. In an effort to promote alternate forms of gender expression, Slesaransky-Poe and Garcia (2010) used a feminist perspective to offer a new conceptual lens with which to examine and interrogate classroom practices that reinforce heteronormativity. They contended that “children   35  with gender variant behaviors and interests are not an alternate or pathogenic form of masculinity or femininity, but rather a healthy expression of a gender continuum” (p. 244). Like Blackburn, they asserted that educators must be able to acknowledge their own biases, reshape their language use, and question their expectations to create learning environments where all people are encouraged to express themselves fully. Their work was framed using bell hooks (1994):      Urging all of us to open our minds and hearts so that we can know beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable, so that we can think and rethink, so that we can create new visions, I celebrate teaching that enables transgressions—a movement against and beyond boundaries. It is that movement which makes education the practice of freedom. (p. 12)  Slesaransky-Poe and Garcia (2010) used a critical feminist approach and drew on a previous article in which they called attention to the treatment of gender variant boys and the urgency of such work. They cited the tragic suicide of Carl Joseph Walker-Hoover who took his life at age 11 in 2009. He did not identify as gay, but his mother said he suffered daily taunts, including “faggot” and “you’re feminine” that he could not bear. Children take their cues from society and “feel the need to police the gender expressions of their peers, and that educators and other adults in children’s lives not only witness, but tacitly and overtly promote this kind of assault and aggression” (p. 245). Why does this happen? The authors suggested that educators and students must better understand that the rules and boundaries that have been created about gender are socially constructed and there are multiple ways of being a boy or a girl. Based on someone’s gender identity and expression, society quickly assesses sexual orientation. Children who do not perform in the heterosexual hegemony are usually punished by their peers and their educators, who in turn do not do anything to disrupt the school culture. Classrooms must be a place of liberation where there is no “us” and “them,” only a “we.”   36  Adolescent literacies. According to Blackburn and Schey (2017), to study literacy, one must study literacy events or “observable behaviors around literacy” (p. 38) to develop an understanding of literacy practices that focus on “cultural practices with which uses of reading and/or writing are associated in given contexts (Street, 1999)” (p. 38). In their paper, Blackburn and Schey frequently used heterosexual hegemony (Atkins & DePalma, 2009) and heterosexual matrix (Butler, 1990) to articulate some important distinctions. The heterosexual matrix refers to the prevailing notion that sexuality and gender are dichotomous. In this paradigm, the norm is that masculine boys/men desire feminine girls/women, and anyone considered to fall outside of this rubric is oppressed. Ultimately, the heterosexual matrix ensures privileges for straight men and the heterosexual hegemony offers an alternative to critiquing the heterosexual matrix.  Atkinson and DePalma (2009) argued that “our critique [of the heterosexual matrix] actually generates heteronormativity by consent” (p. 19) because it reminds people of the dangers of breaking with heteronormativity. A bully shoves a gay boy to assert his heteronormativity, his masculinity. He also shoves a gay boy when he is voguing or holding his boyfriend’s hand as a refusal to consent to heterosexual hegemony “by paying particular attention to people who claim lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, queer, and questioning sexual identities and trans, intersex, queer, and questioning gender expressions” (p. 39).  Blackburn and Schey (2017) explored the tension, overlap, and distinction between LGBT studies and queer theory. In LGBT studies, literacy events and practices that center on LGBTQ-themed texts resulted in students becoming less homophobic and more allies. However, one of the drawbacks of LGBT studies is “exclusive reliance on developmental identity models offered opportunities for rehearsals of homophobia” (p. 42). Queer theory asks readers to suspend categories, but critical feminism and race theory argue that doing so ignores people’s’   37  lived experiences. Often schools that engage in work with LGBT text do so with limited literacy events. Adult perceptions of risk associated with studying topics of sexual identity and/or gender expression could limit literacy events. Teacher anxiety led to giving students the possibility to opt out, and homophobic remarks or factually inaccurate ones went unchallenged. Some educators experienced fear of losing their job, parent complaints, and lack of administrative support, even when legal mandates that support LGBT curricular inclusion were in place (p. 44).  Adolescent culture today reveals that some youth eschew gender and sexual labels (and there are new ones being created every day). Classrooms that do not affirm diversity ultimately lead to students not engaging in learning. sj Miller (2015) proposed a queer literacy framework (QLF) promoting (a)gender and (a)sexuality self-determination and justice so that the classroom space becomes a space of refusal and one that “ruptures dangerous dichotomies and myths about gender and sexuality while educating adolescence/ts about how all students (and others) can be rendered legible” (p. 39). The QLF reflects values that students must be allowed to self-identify however they choose and be provided opportunities to see themselves reflected back in a positive manner (p. 40). Miller (2016) addressed how to support teachers as they learn and take on “a pedagogy of refusal that attends to the most vulnerabilized population of queer youth to date, those that are trans*+” (p. 1). Miller used trans*+ as a noun, prefix, verb, or adjective, as part of the ever-expanding vernacular that is used to identify a non-cisgender person. Using trans*+, or trans with the asterisk and the plus sign, references a continuum of “evolving self-identifications and a useful umbrella term that pushes or signifies identity categories” (p. 2). Miller posited that the state of refusal, rather than being related to a subordinate refusal to do something (which positions students as being troublemakers, averse to learning), could instead be used as a   38  pedagogical strategy that can disrupt the essentialization of all binaries, especially gender. Miller warned that gender and sexuality norms as they exist have created unsafe, even violent conditions for the “millennial generation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender*+, intersex, agender/asexual, gender creative, queer, and questioning youth (LGBT*+IAGCQQ)” (p. 3).      When school climates support and privilege the normalization of heterosexist, cisgender, Eurocentric, unidimensional (i.e. non-intersectional), or gender-normative beliefs—even unconsciously—it forces students who fall outside of those dominant identifiers to focus on simple survival rather than on success and fulfillment in school.  (p. 3)  Young adult literature. Ivey (2017) pointed out that young adults have been, until recently, left out of studies about young adult literature (YAL). In addition, there is a dearth of empirical studies that closely examine classroom-based research on adolescents’ responses to YA literature for reasons that include the tension that exists between studying YA and canonical literature (Hayn, Kaplan, & Nolen, 2011; Ivey, 2017). Despite the lack of research, studies of classrooms that feature YA literature should not be interpreted as not valuable, as the small number of studies that do exist clarify that YAL deserves a prominent position in English curricula.  As a scholar whose research agenda centers on YAL, Ivey (2017) suggested there are many reasons why further research on YA literature and young adults’ responses to it are needed. Ivey’s work reveal/ed that adolescents read to understand their identities, who they want to be in the world and in relation to others. Young people are also interested in books that address familiar social situations and characters with relatable problems and use texts to examine the viewpoints of others and the morality of the knowledge. Adolescents are interested in and engaged by stories that raise their awareness of others. She identified three empirical studies that made a persuasive argument for legitimizing YAL as an untapped resource with the potential to   39  advance adolescent literacy. The first, a study of Grant Street Secondary School4 (Francois, 2013), revealed students’ reading achievement was transformed by sustained efforts to change the reading culture: by offering opportunities to read books that matter to students; by teachers immersing themselves in YA literature to make recommendations, thereby building relationships with adolescents; and humanizing reading instruction.  The second study examined students’ perceptions across four eighth-grade English classrooms at one middle school when teachers replaced assigned reading with student-selected YAL (Ivey & Johnston, 2013). In addition to choosing the literature they would read, students also decided how to respond (or not) to the books. The study was framed by Rosenblatt’s (1983) theory that reading is a transaction between reader and text; that when students read self-selected YAL, they do so to make sense of themselves, relationships with others, and the world. Findings revealed students’ ability to imagine the thoughts and feelings of others increased (Ivey & Johnston, 2013, p. 347), consistent with Bal and Veltkamp’s (2013) study of fiction’s influence on empathy.  The third study was a follow-up (Ivey & Johnston, 2015) of how the classroom practices evolved and the culture changed due to a shift in the goals for teaching and learning that occurred when students were given agency over choosing YA literature and how to respond to it. The authors advocated for future research on YAL that includes young adults. Much of the research found YAL increased students’ propensity to talk and share about their reading (Ivey & Johnston, 2013, p. 351). Ivey’s conclusions about the three studies offered a compelling rationale and she cited Coats (2011), who described YAL as significant because it is organized around exploring tension “between an impulsive individualism and a generative ethics of                                                 4 Notably, Grant Street Secondary School (Francois, 2013) and Pearl Street Collaborative High School, at the center of this study, are the same school with different pseudonyms.    40  interconnectedness” (p. 316). This tension is not unlike hooks’ (2001) insistence that a “love ethic” must be embraced for the ways it can disrupt both an aversion to difference and the impulse for separateness. I believe that because much of my data involve students’ written responses to queer-themed YAL and curriculum that intend to disrupt heteronormativity, my study fills a gap in existing literature about young adults and YAL in classroom-based studies. Reading and Empathy  Much of the research on empathy and reading is in the fields of cognitive psychology, sociology, aesthetics, art criticism, and poetics. For the purposes of this dissertation, I chose to limit my review of this literature to that which seemed most relevant to (adolescent) literacy, pedagogy, and young adult literature. Fiction’s influence on empathy. Dutch scholars Bal and Veltkamp (2013) conducted a quantitative study using transportation theory to predict that when people read fiction and they are emotionally transported into the story, they become more empathetic. The authors conducted two empirical investigations of adult readers’ experiences of fiction reading, compared to a control group that read nonfiction, studying the effects of such reading over time, controlling for previous levels of empathy, and identifying which conditions led to changes in empathy. Bruner (1986) argued the difference between fiction and nonfiction can be a challenge to establish because both employ narrative elements. But for empathy to occur, a reader needs to be able to build a connection with the story.      A reader will be affected by a fictional narrative only when it creates a narrative world that is real within its context, and more importantly, when it is realistic for the reader, thereby creating an opportunity to be drawn into the story. (Bal & Veltkamp, 2013, p. 2)  Bal and Veltkamp (2013) also suggested that the purpose of fiction is to affect the emotional state of the reader, thereby creating a different context than nonfiction does for the reader (p. 3).   41  They also asserted that the effects of fiction on empathy do not happen immediately but require an “incubation period” (p. 4). Suzanne Keen’s (2007) contribution to scholarship about empathy, a collection of ideas gathered from interviews with readers, scholarly articles, and empirical studies, departed from much of the literature because she did not assume that social good comes from empathetic reading (p. 65), like Kumashiro (2000) who suggested that interrogating privilege and action must follow empathy. Of those Keen interviewed who were asked about empathy and reading, character identification was a prevalent theme. In other words, naming a character “may set readers’ empathy in motion; indeed information leading to precise placement of a character in terms of species, race, age, gender, and other aspects of status often appears after an emotional hook has connected reader and character” (p. 69).  The concept of the “emotional hook” is of note, as it tied to Bal and Veltkamp’s (2013) finding that readers’ connection to the seemingly real but fictive world encountered in narrative fiction is what makes empathy possible. One of Keen’s (2007) hypotheses further suggested that empathy occurs when a reader is able to identify with a character, even when they differ from each other in many ways (p. 70). Most often, readers empathize with characters that encounter obstacles, which Keen referred to as “mainstream empathy” (p. 74). Yet, she also encountered readers who were able to build an emotional connection with a flawed, secondary character. When the readers justified their dissenting interpretations, Keen called this practice “emotional stretching,” for the ways they emphasized the humanity of a despised character (p. 74). This is compelling in the ways it could pertain to young adult readers in a high school context, who might also engage in emotional stretching to empathize with a problematic character, perhaps as   42  a result of the heteronormative school space, and a lack of critical reading practices that foster inquiry, analysis, and discussion. Adolescent readers. Many teachers of ELA would agree that literature that moves students to be empathic is an important value of adolescent literacy. Young people who are able to express empathy and build emotional connections to characters in the books they read are more likely to cultivate a love of reading and learning. They are able to better understand themselves and other people, and begin to critique an unjust world (Vogt, Chow, Fernandez, Grubman, & Stacey, 2016). Living in a democracy requires its citizens to be literate, to participate fully in civic pursuits (Wolk, 2009).  YA literature offers educators exciting opportunities to promote empathy in students because of its prevalent use of first-person narration and adolescent protagonists. Narrative fiction draws readers toward imagining (and empathizing) with the narrator, and multiple perspectives allow for young adult readers to experience the feelings of more than one character and to, in effect, become part of the novel. Vogt et al. (2016) argued that realistic fiction is especially well suited to teach adolescents about empathy for its attempts to address complex themes that are relevant in society (p. 40). In addition, teaching with YAL is likely to ensure that students feel a sense of social responsibility and caring (Wolk, 2009). Since I could not identify empirical studies that examined a correlation between YAL and empathy in adolescent readers, and its potential significance in adolescent literacies, my findings in Chapter IV suggest a gap in the existing scholarly literature on queer-inclusive ELA.  Empathy is not enough. The ability of students to build a connection and feel empathy for characters in literature is only sufficient if it also brings about action toward social justice and a critique of oppressive forces. Kumashiro (2000) wrote that a strength of anti-oppressive   43  education is in its teaching about the Other, in that it requires teachers to normalize difference and work against partial knowledge students have of the Other, which also develops students’ empathy for the Other (Britzman, 1995). However, this did not bring about change, and the presentation of the dominant narrative may even cause otherness to be read as different from the norm. It could also be argued that empathy further perpetuates an “us/them” binary (Britzman, 1995). Kumashiro (2000) asserted that teaching must also include an interrogation of privilege and systems of oppression. Privileging empathy as the end goal of an anti-oppressive education is insufficient because oppression does not lie with how individuals think, feel, or treat the other (p. 35). Students must learn about the ways that some groups are normalized and privileged and how that is maintained by society, and that schools are complicit in perpetuating this narrative. Conceptual Framework  This study was aimed toward advancing literacy research that works to dismantle oppression and heteronormativity in schools and advocates for social justice-centered teaching. Through embracing queer pedagogy, teachers can engage students in critical queer literacies—moving them to envision and take part in creating an equitable society. I chose practitioner research methodology, which I outline in the following chapter, because I believe that my experiences teaching and collaboratively designing a queer-inclusive curriculum illuminate the need for a culturally relevant queer pedagogy that centers adolescents as agents of change and will contribute a unique perspective to the existing literature on the topic.  Disrupting the status quo is of particular concern to Kumashiro (2001), who studied what it could mean for educators to teach in anti-oppressive ways in all core disciplines (not just English). His research documented how student teachers and practicing teachers complain that theory on anti-oppressive education is often too difficult to carry into practice and they are   44  reluctant to examine their own complicity in oppression. English classrooms are specifically charged as they often insist on teaching a literary “canon” that can perpetuate bias even further, based on race, class, gender, and sexuality, because the authors and characters studied are so often White, middle-class, male, heterosexual people (Palumbo-Liu, 1995; Schmitz, Rosenfelt, Butler, & Guy-Sheftall, 1995; Sumara, 1993). In other words, certain experiences are privileged, which does nothing to disrupt the “partial knowledges” (Kumashiro, 2001, p. 4) about marginalized groups that many students have—thus perpetuating oppression and creating new forms of it right inside the classroom. In addition, teaching that seeks to disrupt oppression must also address the ways that students and society as a whole resist change, especially when it challenges notions about perceived others.  Embodying an anti-oppressive educational approach to teaching, one that I document in this dissertation, is an ongoing endeavor that will continue for the duration of my academic career. In Chapter IV, the interspersed block quotes from participants (both spoken and written) and my own personal vignettes therein are meant to illustrate a patchwork of (queer) themes that arose out of the data. I do not always introduce or define the subheadings I used to organize this data because in some places, I attempt to let the data speak for themselves. There were moments during both teaching and data analysis that I felt, despite knowing my students and colleagues well, my efforts to prepare and teach in ways that honor and affirm all identities fell short of that objective. Kumashiro (2002) described a similar dilemma when he wrote:       By leaving little room for what is uncontrollable and unknowable in education...my preparation also left little room for addressing ways that learning can be unexpectedly difficult, discomforting, and even emotional. (p. 7)  For me, this study was all of that and more. Being intimately tied to and personally invested in LGBTQIA*+ affirmative research, coupled with a deep sense of accountability to my   45  teaching community and students, meant there were moments of heartbreak when I perceived that, in spite of my visibility as a fierce queer ally with 18 years of teaching experience, I was not always prepared for some of the unexpected moments that arose. There was the beautiful joined by the strange. Moments that felt at once troubling and significant. Attempting to disrupt powerful, dichotomous structures is challenging, complicated, messy work. This dissertation lays bare what happened when I attempted to employ a social justice framework to put theory into practice and enact teaching that makes visible diverse sexualities and genders in the spirit of honoring and affirming all youth.     46  Chapter III   METHODOLOGY  Study Design  This dissertation was qualitative practitioner research (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 2009) utilizing interviews, teaching memos and observations, and artifact study. The purpose of the study was to explore ninth-grade students’ responses to reading a variety of LGBTQIA*+-themed YA fiction, media, and nonfiction texts, and the teachers’ pedagogical and collaborative curriculum planning experiences. I studied my own classroom, my students’ written artifacts, my collaboration with four teachers, and their interpretations and experiences with designing and teaching a curricular unit centered on disrupting dominant narratives about sexuality and gender across two ninth-grade English classes. I also considered the teachers’ perceptions about the extent to which the school climate was queer-friendly, and whether their own professional development and teacher preparation programs addressed the importance of teaching that included LGBTQIA*+ themes, characters, and content. I then examined both the students’ responses to a queer-inclusive curriculum and teachers’ responses to their pedagogical and curricular choices, and the following themes emerged: queer pedagogy, cultural relevance, reading and empathy, and critical queer literacy. Through the lens of these themes, I attempted to theorize a critical queer literacy pedagogy that centers queer adolescence and culturally responsive curriculum to advance adolescent literacy. Research Questions This practitioner research study examined my teaching memos, observations, and interviews, and my students’ writing at Pearl Street Collaborative High School,1 a racially and                                                 1 Pseudonym for the school.   47  socioeconomically diverse, queer-friendly, public Grade 6-12 Title I school in New York City. My discussion of the importance of queer-inclusive curricula and pedagogy in Chapter II aided me in establishing the research questions for this study. Table 1  Research Questions  Research Question Guiding Sub-questions What happens when ninth-grade students engage in a study of YA queer literature in a public, Title I, queer-friendly high school in New York City? How does reading and writing that centers on analyzing YA queer literature reinforce or disrupt normative discourses about LGBTQ youth? How do students read, interpret, and analyze diverse sexualities and genders?  How do they resist and/or subscribe to dominant narratives about people of diverse sexualities and genders?  What can be learned from their (written) interpretive stances pertaining to queer identities? What happens when teachers use collaborative planning to design curriculum that intends to disrupt heteronormativity and facilitate students’ reading of YA queer literature? To what extent is the school queer-friendly?  What are their experiences with teaching queer inclusive curricula?  What are the resonant moments while teaching and designing a unit that intends to disrupt heteronormativity?  Why Practitioner Research?  Cochran-Smith and Lytle (2009) used the term practitioner research to describe inquiry and self-study as liberatory modes that have the potential to transform teaching as it seeks to put teachers at the center of education reform. They suggested that practitioner researchers “regard struggle and self-critical questioning as integral parts of their intellectual lives” (p. 114), and teaching that includes systematic inquiry and collaboration is a necessary disruption to top-down,   48  evidence-based education reform measures (that do little to create the kind of schools that students deserve). Practitioner research is marginalized and discouraged as it presents ethical challenges and issues of trustworthiness. This view nearly prevented me from choosing a practitioner framework for my study. As I wrote the proposal for this dissertation, I learned that the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) forbids its teachers from studying their own students and, as such, their IRB board will not approve any study that does so. To secure approval, I had to work within these constraints and rely on student artifacts to capture their voices in response to queer content (since interviews of current students are forbidden). The queer book club unit at the center of this research fit seamlessly into a rigorous literacy curriculum,2 and the school’s principal and literacy coach agreed that it was a relevant addition. Even though the creation of the unit was informed by my doctoral studies and research agenda, the unit was planned collaboratively and vertically aligned with the school’s English department curriculum.  In an essay about choosing self-study, Mary Phillips Manke (2005) suggested it is othered in the ways that queer people are othered, dismissed, and excluded—making it worthy of inclusion in qualitative research. While my study was not necessarily self-study, I believe that this research, which I have conducted as an insider, affords the field of literacy education insight into queer-inclusive teaching that intends to disrupt harmful narratives about queer people, whose learning is hampered by homophobia and transphobia. Such teaching continues to be cast on the margins, making it ever important for scholarship that attempts to understand how a critical queer pedagogy can be claimed by practitioners and teacher educators who want to make                                                 2 Pearl Street Collaborative High School was recently awarded the Library of Congress American Prize for literacy.   49  schools a place where all children and adolescents, especially those with intersectional, diverse sexualities and genders, can learn, be seen, and loved. Participants Selection Once it was clear to me that I was not able to recruit any students for my study, the selection process was fairly simple. I asked each teacher who was involved in planning and teaching the ninth-grade YA queer book club unit if they were interested in participating in this research. All four teachers3 whom I asked (Anna, Cassandra, Mateo, and Roseline4) consented to participate, which included audio-recorded interviews. In addition, all were aware of the written data I was generating after our curriculum planning meetings and teaching. I considered recruiting additional teachers at Pearl Street, as several teach or are interested in queer-inclusive curricula. For the purposes of the research questions, which centered on the ninth-grade queer book club, a limited number of adult participants was most appropriate. The Participants Initially, I was reluctant to provide any additional details about my teaching colleagues who consented to participate in this research. To this end, I have tried to avoid naming their teaching roles in an effort to protect their identities. However, after presenting my initial draft of the completed dissertation to my sponsor, I am grateful that she encouraged me to write the portraits that follow. Once I began, however, I found it challenging to capture adequately the extraordinary people with whom I work so closely doing a job that is, even on the best of days, extremely challenging. The following vignettes describe my relationship with each of the participants and the ways they may have shaped my own experience as a teacher researcher.                                                  3 See Table 2 for participants’ self-identified characteristics. 4 Participants’ names are pseudonyms.    50  Anna. I met Anna at the beginning of my teaching career, as a student teacher at Pearl Street Collaborative High School. At the time, she was one of two tenth-grade humanities teachers, and I was assigned to be supervised by Matt, her teaching colleague. This meant my first experiences with collaborative curriculum planning were with Anna.  At the time, the word “faggot” could be heard in hallways and common areas of the school, and Anna was part of the earliest conversations about how to confront homophobia as a learning community. She invited me to participate in these conversations, even though I was a new and inexperienced teacher, because she understood that I wanted to be part of and learn more about how to support LGBTQ students and colleagues. As an ally, this was (and continues to be) very important to me, but Anna is one of the people who helped me understand that, as a lesbian teacher, the work has deep personal significance rooted in historical oppression. Since I have known Anna the entire time I have been at Pearl Street, it is difficult for me to capture the essence of dozens of conversations we have had over the years, about interrupting homophobia and transphobia, the importance of queer visibility, and school initiatives that aim to advocate for queer people (including the creation of an all-gender bathroom). She was also one of the very few colleagues in whom I confided when my brother Vaughn came out as transgender, which, at first, I struggled to accept. As an avid reader (especially of YA fiction), and a purveyor of all things queer, Anna is one of the first people I go to when I want to find the latest and greatest books that feature the lives and experiences of queer, nonbinary, and gender expansive people. Cassandra. This was my first year teaching ninth-grade English at Pearl Street, and my first true collaboration with Cassandra, who has taught ninth grade since she began her teaching career, like myself, at Pearl Street. Since we began working together (as collaborative ninth-  51  grade English curriculum planning partners: she taught one half of the students and I taught the other), I learned we have something else in common. Cassandra attended a rival high school, one town over from the town where I grew up. Even though I was a high school student long before she was, it was fun to figure that out.  Without Cassandra’s agreement to teach a queer book club unit, which required no persuasion and which she was happy to consent to, this study would have been impossible. In addition, despite all of my research and knowledge of the subject, Cassandra suggested many short texts that became some of the most engaging to teach, especially those about queer athletes. She also planned and organized a field trip to the Paley Center for Media, which was brilliantly timed to happen at the end of the unit, so that our students could attend a special screening of Love, Simon, the first wide-release feature film to center the experiences of a gay teenager.  Cassandra is a voracious reader, with whom I had trouble keeping up as we read novels we considered for the Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Clubs unit. Her experience with ninth graders, which she downplays, was extraordinarily helpful to me. She brought a wry sense of humor to our planning meetings, which occurred three times a week, and were always a bright spot in my day.  Mateo. Before I began my doctoral studies, I was one of two tenth-grade English teachers and Mateo was the history teacher. Since then, both of our teaching roles have changed. But at that time, or “back in the day” as Mateo called it, he was a regular attendee of Pearl Street’s GSA. I forgot about this until Mateo mentioned during our interview that, at that time, he had many homophobic male students and he wanted them to see him as an ally, an action that he rightly believed would make an impact on them.   52  When Mateo returned to Pearl Street after moving to the Dominican Republic to teach for a few years, the community rejoiced. When I joined the ninth-grade team last year, we were delighted to be working together again, after several years had passed. Mateo’s presence in our classroom is at once unmistakably warm and fiercely compelling. Like Cassandra, he downplays his contributions to the collaborative planning and his pedagogical precision. Mateo can read the classroom in a millisecond and offer up a question to students that will move them to think, reflect, and posit theories. When he publicly affirms their intellectual stamina and thoughtfulness, as is a norm in our class, I can see them grow taller in their seats. I feel taller as well, whenever Mateo and I debrief a lesson or troubleshoot how to engage a difficult student. I could perhaps write another dissertation about Mateo’s pedagogical philosophy and his ability to understand and identify students’ social and emotional needs. Roseline. Like Anna, I have known Roseline for most of my teaching career. When she joined the teaching staff at Pearl Street from another school, I was in my first year. We worked collaboratively as middle school teachers for a few years, until I began teaching tenth grade and she left to pursue doctoral studies. Roseline is one of a select few at Pearl Street who has first-hand knowledge of the many shenanigans we encountered professionally (and engaged in personally) as youthful teachers early in our careers. We still laugh about teaching a unit on The Giver (Lowry, 1993) that lasted for over 2 months. I repeat: Over. Two. Months. Occasionally, she will hold up the book and we will burst into laughter.  Roseline kept in touch during her doctoral work and suggested that I co-author an article with another colleague about the historic resonance of Obama’s presidency and what it could mean for education. I might not have pursued a doctoral degree without her encouragement to write that article. Roseline has long been someone I seek out—to collaborate, commiserate, and   53  problem solve with, to confide in, seek guidance from, and I have grown professionally from doing so. She has challenged and inspired me to push through, keep going, and write workshop proposals when I thought I was too busy because she reminds me at just the right moments that I have something to offer. If I am fortunate, we will write something together, perhaps about our collaborative experiences and long careers at Pearl Street. Perhaps about not taking 10 weeks to teach any novel. Ever.

All names are pseudonyms.  There is more I could write about my relationships with these teachers, my students, and certainly about all of the incredible people of Pearl Street. However, in the next section, I move on to provide a rich description that attempts to capture the spirit of Pearl Street Collaborative High School. Research Site and Population Pearl Street Collaborative High School5 is one of the 38 member schools in the New York Performance Standards Consortium,6 which formed over 20 years ago to promote a research agenda that finds performance-based assessment tasks (PBATs) more meaningful,                                                 5 Pseudonym for the school 6 http://www.performanceassessment.org/whatisperformanceassessment/   54  intellectually rigorous, and indicative of college readiness than one-size-fits-all standardized tests. The Consortium member schools are currently exempt from requiring New York State Regents exams as a graduation requirement, with PBATs and portfolio presentations in every subject that students do in their place. (Despite the waiver from the state, students at Pearl Street Collaborative High School take the English Regents.) Michele Fine and Pedro Noguera wrote the forward to the 2017 Report on the Consortium’s most recent school data. Consortium schools offer great hope for public education as a tool for social justice and equity, and Pearl Street strives to embody all of the Consortium’s principles. It is a Grade 6-12 small school that prizes student voice, small class size, and teacher collaboration located in New York City. According to the most recent (2017-18) School Quality Snapshot published by the NYCDOE, 683 students were enrolled in Grades 6-12. The high school enrollment (Grades 9-12) consisted of 385 students out of the overall student body. Of the high school students, 23% received special education services and student demographics were Asian, 12%; Black, 19%; Hispanic, 54%; and White, 11%. Student attendance was 94% and 97% graduated from high school in 4 years. The school’s literacy coach and all 10 English teachers across Grades 6-12 collaborated on writing the mission statement for the English department. It is excerpted below:   A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in  their mission can alter the course of history. --Mahatma Gandhi  Our Mission Who we are We are a group of teachers who love teaching English at Pearl Street.  What we believe about literature, reading, and writing We believe that literature affords people the opportunity to make sense of the world around them, and we understand that reading and writing translate to power and opportunity in the world. We acknowledge that strong literacy skills provide the foundation for success in other disciplines, in college, and beyond. Because interacting with literature raises more questions than absolute truths, we believe that reading grows and requires emotional, cognitive, and social intelligence. We also believe that there is   55  power in language, and as such, authentic reading and writing enable individuals to make their voices heard in the world and can give meaning to an individual’s life. Furthermore, we understand that literature enables readers to connect to people who are both familiar and unfamiliar, allowing readers to step outside of their own world and into the worlds of others.   What Pearl Street kids deserve from their English teachers We embrace a pedagogy of love—for literature, writing, reading, and for our students. We have a commitment to teaching students from underserved and marginalized populations and want our students to do more than just to learn how to read and write; we want to empower them to learn how to question, challenge, and dismantle the status quo. Each day, we want our students to engage in reading and writing in authentic ways, and we aim to have our students read and write what matters to them with real audiences. In our English classes, we want our students to think hard, evaluate and re-evaluate texts, reflect with their peers, and be willing to hear and take on a variety of perspectives. We believe that our students have inherent strengths in reading and writing that can be as valuable as our strengths as teachers. We also want our students to take risks, to be vulnerable as learners, and to step out of their skin to understand. We want our students to see a connection between reading and writing today and access and power in the future, especially in college, in their careers, and in the world. We want our students to love reading and writing.  Whole class reading In addition to supporting independent readers, teachers choose a selection of shared texts—novels, memoirs, short fiction, poetry, plays, excerpts from longer works, nonfiction articles, digital media, etc.—for all students in a grade to read across the year. Teachers make informed choices about shared texts and choose a variety of texts. Some texts are considered “classics” while others aim to center the curriculum on relevant social issues such as race, gender, gender expression, homophobia, class, and coming of age.   The mission of the English team at the Pearl Street Collaborative High School made  it a compelling site for this study, which examined a queer-inclusive pedagogy and reading LGBTQIA*+ young adult literature. What kind of impact does a school that promotes social justice and centers curriculum on dismantling oppression in many forms have on its students? How do teachers engage in doing such work and what supports their efforts to make lasting change? The school building is flanked by a basketball court that doubles as a skateboarding park, a soccer pitch, and a community garden. There are bright murals including one by the Kevin   56  Durant (NBA Golden State Warriors forward) Foundation, with the words “Build it and they will ball,” installed after the court was refurbished as part of his initiative to revamp basketball courts in high-poverty schools and neighborhoods. The pre-war building is in desperate need of renovation, but upon entering the cafeteria, one sees the walls have fresh paint, flat-screen monitors display school announcements and student opportunities, and flags of every nation from which students and staff hail are prominently featured (near a plaque that includes the directive to email the school secretary if your flag is currently not represented). Even though the staircases have aging caged barriers and cracked red paint on the banisters, and the classrooms’ walls have cracked paint and mismatched floor tiles, the hallways are a reflection of the love, respect, and hard work the adults pour into the space: there are framed flyers with announcements for school club meetings, author visits, and upcoming Principal’s Book Club meetings and reading challenges; inspirational quotes painted on the walls by Toni Morrison, Harvey Milk, and Barack Obama; color photographs of students and faculty—on field trips, engaged in science experiments, engrossed in reading books, standing next to Queen Latifah on a recent visit. Students call teachers, the principal, and all adults by their first name. Teachers’ classroom doors are decorated with signs that name the book they are currently reading, extracurricular activities they participated in when they were in school, Black Lives Matter posters, rainbow flags, and more.

As a practitioner inquiry, this research was concerned with the ninth-grade population and their teachers. Since I am one of the teachers, I was both inside and outside the data.  I collaboratively planned and then taught a unit titled Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Clubs, during which students engaged in a variety of literacy practices to learn about the dominant narratives in society and some of the pioneers of the LGBT rights movement (and its connection to the Civil Rights Movement); and to read, analyze, and discuss a collection of multimedia texts, including two works of YA fiction in a book club (with two-four peers).\\ The book club unit included nine works of YA fiction (selected in collaboration with the rest of the ninth-grade teachers and one researcher) that feature characters who are LGBT and intersex. I wanted to choose books written from the perspective of African American, Asian, Latinix, and Middle Eastern characters. Many popular YA novels deal with LGBT themes and issues, and many focus on primarily White characters. Since the majority of the students in the school are Latinix and African American, the selection of books took much time and was a priority. I read and considered close to 20 different novels, and in collaboration with my ninth-grade teaching colleague, chose nine YA novels for the students to read in book clubs. The nonfiction and media texts were selected collaboratively during regularly a full-day curriculum planning meeting and regularly scheduled (twice weekly) planning meetings (see Table 4 for   59  annotations on the texts selected for the unit, and Appendix A for a list of the titles and media selected for the unit).

Methods My data collection consisted of conducting one-on-one interviews with each of the four participants, and gathering collected artifacts including my students’ written responses to two YA novels and memos and observations of my teaching and planning. (I did not include the emails I sent to a researcher regarding the selection of the nine YA novels.) There were three sets of data: interviews, artifacts, and memos/observations. Interviews. This study sought to understand what happens in English classrooms that teach queer-inclusive curricula and the extent to which collaboration facilitates students’ reading of YA queer literature. Interviewing the teachers who were part of the collaborative process and   61  instruction of the unit was a source of data that offered nuance to the study. Interview data can be subjective and dependent on a particular context because it is a contrived interaction, not necessarily definitive of “truth” as it is articulated by a participant (Lankshear & Knobel, 2010). Even so, the four participants were colleagues with whom I worked for at least 1 school year in a collaborative setting. I conducted interviews with each of them, approximately 3 weeks after the teaching of the unit was over and at the end of the school year. Participants often reveal things in interviews that they would not say otherwise in everyday contexts (Carspecken, 1996), and spending 40 minutes with each of the participants as the school year was winding down, with no students in the building, made for a setting that was meant to be conducive of reflection. Lankshear and Knobel (2010) also noted that despite the subjectivity of interviews, they “remain the best available means for accessing study participants’ opinions, beliefs, values and situated accounts of events at a particular point in time” (p. 199). Since the rest of my data were collected from on my own observations, memos, and artifacts of my students, the reflections of the other teachers and administrators who were involved in the teaching across the ninth grade were vital. In addition, interviews can allow for data source triangulation, as described by Hammersley and Atkinson (2010, p. 183), since the accounts of different participants on the same events can offer nuanced interpretations of the phenomenon being studied. The interviews were semi-structured and audio recorded; the following questions guided the discussions: 1. How many years have you been in your current position?  2. How many years have you been/were you a teacher?  3. How many years at Pearl Street Collaborative? 4. Would you call PSCHS a queer-friendly school? What makes it that way?   62  5. Because my study involves exploring the impact of identity on teaching and learning an anti-oppression curriculum, are you comfortable identifying your race, ethnicity, gender identity, and sexuality?  6. Prior to collaborating on the ninth-grade Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Club unit, what has your experience been with teaching that includes LGBTQ+ themes and issues? 7. Did your teacher preparation program in grad school address doing anti-oppression curriculum, and was it inclusive of LGBTQ literature or themes?  8. Did your administrator/librarian training include LGBTQ content or literature? 9. Of the nine YA novels selected for the unit, which one was your favorite?  10. How well (or not well) did the unit planning day prepare you/the teachers to launch the unit in your/their classes?  11. Do any of the day-to-day planning meetings stand out as being particularly memorable?  12. What additional resources would you need to support teachers and design curriculum that intends to disrupt dominant narratives about LGBT youth of color? 13. Do any lessons/activities stand out as being particularly effective or transformative for you? the students? The teachers? (i.e. teaching that facilitated students’ reading of queer lit) 14. Could you discuss whether the students and/or the teachers resisted and/or subscribed to dominant narratives about queer and gender variant people?  I transcribed three of the four audio-recorded interviews and used a transcript service for the fourth; I then edited the prepared transcript, using the original recording for accuracy.    63  Artifacts. Lankshear and Knobel (2010, p. 246) described the different forms of written data that can be collected in qualitative teacher research, including texts (such as students’ written work as part of a classroom assignment) that exist independently of a study. Since my study sought to understand the ways that students read and analyze sexuality and gender in YA literature, collecting their written responses to the novels they read with a small group of peers, even though completed as part of their homework and eventually graded, seemed worthy of analysis for the purposes of this dissertation.  All of the ninth-grade students were assigned to read two YA books in a book club (in a group of two-four peers) and to complete a total of nine written responses about the novels: four responses to a significant passage in each of the two books and one book review discussing both books as one of the culminating assignments at the end of the unit. The writing my students generated during the unit, which would have existed regardless of this study, were collected as extant texts to be analyzed as data. I gathered my students’ (N = 44) written responses to their YA book club books after the grading for the unit had been completed and the school year was over. To protect my students’ anonymity, all of their names were removed and replaced with pseudonyms. In total, I analyzed 235 artifacts, the bulk of my data, and I collected two types of assignments: (a) written responses to significant passages8 (self-selected by students) in each of the two assigned YA novels, and (b) a culminating book review9 of the two YA novels. Below, Table 5 details the characteristics of the students and the number of artifacts collected from each and is followed by Table 6, which details the student groupings, how many read each of the nine titles, and the designated reading level, descending from low to high.                                                 8 Students’ assignment, taken from handout (see Appendix B): Each night you must select a passage you believe is significant and mark the page with a sticky note. Then, in your notebook copy the quote and page number, and write 1-2 beefy paragraphs that analyze the passage. Include why you think it is significant. 9 See Appendix C for details.   64  Table 5 Characteristics of Ninth-Grade English Students Name (pseudonyms) Class Gender Identity Race Artifacts (out of 9 assigned) Olivia         1  Girl  Hispanic    4 Maia         1  Girl  Hispanic    9 Kayson         1  Boy  African American   6 Axel         1  Boy  White     1 (5-illegible) Andrew         1  Boy  White     6 Jose         1  Boy  Hispanic    6 Berto         1  Boy  Hispanic    7 Abigail         1  Girl  Biracial (African American/Hispanic) 1 Emilia         1  Girl  Hispanic    8 Ibrahim         1  Boy  African American  1 (out of 5 assigned10) Maria11         1  Girl  Biracial (Hispanic/White)   11  Kenneth         1  Boy  Hispanic    5 (4-illegible) Margarita        1  Girl  Hispanic    9 Vicente         1  Boy  Hispanic    4 Kaito         1  Boy  Pacific Islander    3 Hazel         1  Girl  Hispanic    7 Benjamin        1  Boy  Hispanic    1 Cameron        1  Boy  African American   3 Isidora         1  Girl  Hispanic    6 Antonio         1  Boy  Hispanic    5 Alexa         1  Girl  Hispanic    2 Salome         1  Girl  Hispanic    0 Bruno         1  Boy  Hispanic    6 Sofia         1  Girl  Hispanic    4 Emerson        1  Boy  Biracial (Hispanic/White)   7 Alma         2  Girl  Hispanic    7 Diego         2  Boy  Hispanic    6 Laila         2  Girl  African American   8 Aliyah         2  Girl  Biracial (African American/Hispanic) 6 Sebastian        2  Trans boy Hispanic    1 Juan Diego        2  Boy  Hispanic    2 Teagan         2  Girl  White     5 (4 missing) Inez         2  Girl  Hispanic    9 Kervens         2  Boy  African American   9 Danielle         2  Girl  Hispanic    8 Tyler         2  Boy  African American   1 Lucia         2  Girl  Hispanic    4 (4 missing) Josiah         2  Boy  Biracial (African American/Hispanic) 7 Alessandra        2  Girl  Hispanic    5 Bernardo        2  Boy  Hispanic    8 Jordan         2  Boy  Biracial (African American/Hispanic) 1 Aaron         2  Boy  Hispanic    6 Alex12         2  Boy  Asian     11 David         2  Boy  Asian     9       Total artifacts analyzed:             235 ____________________________________________________________________________________                                                 10 Ibrahim read one YA novel, so was assigned 4 quote responses and 1 book review. 11 Maria misread the assignment and completed 2 additional responses to None of the Above. 12 Alex misread the assignment and completed 2 additional responses to None of the Above.   65  Table 6 Leveled Book Club Groups ______________________________________________________________________________  Reading Title    Class 1    Class 2 Level     Book 1  Book 2  Book 1  Book 2 _____________________________________________________________________________________ Low  From the Notebooks  Jose  Ibrahim 13 Tyler14 of Melanin Sun  Bruno     Berto     Emerson    The House You Pass     Alex on the Way    Hazel Cameron                                    Antonio     Boyfriends With Alexa  Jose   Girlfriends  Hazel  Bruno      Isidora  Berto      Cameron Emerson  Antonio  Medium Aristotle and   Olivia    Kervens   Dante Discover  Margarita    Josiah   the Secrets of the  Kenneth   Diego   Universe  Vicente    None of the Above Maria  Olivia  Alma  Sebastian      Sofia  Isidora  Aliyah  Danielle      Salome  Kenneth Aaron  Laila      Kayson  Vicente  Alex  ---------            Kervens            Josiah            Diego            Bernardo                                                    13 Ibrahim returned from a suspension as the book clubs were finishing.

All names are pseudonyms. Artifacts Part I: Students’ written responses to significant passages in each YA novel. The eight assigned responses to significant passages were based on the students’ own selections of passages from the novel that they found significant. Students wrote their responses outside of class. The total number of responses assigned (a total of 8 to each of the 43 students—4 for each of the two books that each student read, and a total of 5 assigned to one student who only read one book, due to absences) was 348 responses.  A total of 109 responses were collected for class 1 (including 9 illegible artifacts that were not able to be analyzed) and 97 collected for class 2 (not including 8 artifacts that were   67  originally collected, but missing, so not analyzed—from Teagan and Lucia). Therefore, in class 1, a total of 100 responses to significant passages were analyzed; in class 2, a total of 97 responses to significant passages were analyzed. Responses to significant passages were handwritten and not all were legible.15 I kept track of which documents were not able to be analyzed.  At first, these artifacts were grouped by class 1 or 2. Before I read through all of the students’ responses to significant passages, I organized them by book title, so that I would be analyzing large sets of responses16 to the novels.  Artifacts Part II: Students’ book reviews (of two YA books). Each student was assigned a typed 2- to 4-page book review discussing both books at the end of the unit. Of the 44 students in both of my classes combined, I collected 22 book reviews from class 1 and 16 book reviews from class 2. All 38 book reviews were analyzed.  Practitioner memos and observations. Cochran-Smith and Lytle (2009) outlined a necessary shift toward theorizing practitioner inquiry as inclusive of teacher and student voice, with practitioners’ own constructions of their myriad experiences of teaching and their students and classrooms at the center. My daily teaching memos and observations captured snippets of student talk, my perceptions of how they were responding to queer content, and curriculum planning notes. Full participant observation of one accountable talk discussion at the end of students’ reading of one YA novel (and multiple shared texts). I wrote memos about my teaching, or what Lankshear and Knobel (2010) referred to as “indirect records of observations (e.g. post facto notes written from memory after the observation                                                 15 See Table 5 for characteristics of the ninth-grade students and the number of artifacts collected and analyzed. 16 See Table 6, which indicates the reading level of the novels, the student groupings for each class, and total number of students read that each novel.   68  period has ended)” (p. 219) on and about 14 of the 23 teaching days devoted to the Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Clubs unit in ninth-grade English. In class 1, there were six book club groups (25 students in total); in class 2, there were five groups (19 students in total). They were assigned two YA books to read. The students sat in their groups and were given their first book club text on day three of the unit. They were assigned their second book on day nine of the unit. On some days, I only wrote a memo for one of the two English classes taught, but for most of the 14 days’ worth of memos, I wrote about both classes. In total, I wrote 13 memos for class 1 and 12 memos for class 2. I wrote a full participant observation of the “accountable talk” discussion (similar to a Socratic seminar) on day seven of the unit for both classes. The focus question for the discussion was Taking into account the essential questions17 for the unit, what is the most significant idea across the texts that we have read so far? My student teacher wrote three observations (primarily a brief transcript) of my teaching. One of the observations was about class 1 and the other two were observations of class 2.  Working the Data Maykut and Morehouse (1994, p. 132) described the nuances of qualitative data analysis as a metaphorical accordion—the initial discoveries enable the researcher to pull apart and back—which can illuminate even greater depths of the phenomenon being studied. The                                                 17 Essential Questions for the ninth grade Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Club unit:  ● How can analytical reading, writing, and discussion in a book club deepen the way our theories about a text evolve? ● How does reading across a variety of texts help us examine intersectionality and heteronormativity in society? ● How can art, video, or writing be used to raise awareness about heteronormativity in schools or society? ● How can literature and media give us increased empathy around the identity of all?   69  challenge and the beauty of the qualitative approach to research are that data analysis is designed by the researcher.  I began rudimentary coding once I collected and gathered all of the data. First, I replaced student and teacher names with pseudonyms on all interview transcripts, teaching memos and observations, and student artifacts, and then made duplicate sets of each data source. I created separate folders for each research question which served two purposes: (a) to organize the data that would enable me to answer each, and (b) so I could read and analyze clean copies of each. Then I read and examined each piece of data (within each data set gathered) through the lens of the associated research question using the constant comparative method (Maykut & Morehouse, 1994), by creating units of analysis as they appeared in the data. To do this, I made note (in a handwritten journal) of anything that seemed a possible answer to the RQ including what I noticed, found compelling, and any emergent patterns, or disruptions of patterns. Once I completed the initial looking, I went back and read through all of my notations and typed a conceptual memo to begin to articulate emergent ideas and where the analysis might be headed. I repeated this process for each set of data, starting with handwritten journal entries, then moving to typed conceptual memos and making ties between the sets of data. Writing memos during the data analysis stage of a qualitative study is a process that can not only capture thinking but also facilitates thinking (Groenewald, 2008; Maxwell, 2013; Miles & Huberman, 1994; Strauss, 1987). After I wrote conceptual memos at the conclusion of each initial read of each data set, I was able to see themes that emerged both within and across the data. This enabled me to solidify and write descriptions of the themes and their attendant codes. I then set about the work of going back through all of the data sets for a closer read and to unitize with codes using this new   70  analytical frame. I coded data with symbols and highlighters and wrote index cards to reorganize the data according to the code and kept a preliminary chart to check for the frequency of the code, to ensure that there were multiple data to be included. There were times I would collapse one code into another within the same theme. I used this same approach for the data collected for each research question.  Three main themes emerged for each research question and each had associated subthemes (see Figure 1). Analytical frames for reading the students’ writing about reading. As I described in the previous section, the procedures I used to organize and analyze the data for this study were an immersive exploration of the ways that each data source answered the research questions. But RQ2 and its guiding subquestions were concerned with reading: How do students read, interpret, and analyze diverse sexualities and genders? How do they resist and/or subscribe to dominant narratives about people of diverse sexualities and genders? What can be learned from their (written) interpretive stances pertaining to queer identities?  Again, for RQ2 as with the other questions, I began by noting compelling and discrepant patterns in a handwritten journal. Reading my students’ work was at once familiar and foreign. As an English teacher, mining student responses to works of literature and closely scrutinizing them in an attempt to trace the footprints of their thinking and depth of analysis is a regular part of my practice. But the procedures I used for this qualitative study, which included multiple and varied readings of their responses, were revelatory. So it was interesting to read their work, now collected as data, and apply a researcher’s lens to search for patterns and to name their interpretive practices in relationship to reading diverse sexualities and genders. Since this study is concerned with queer literature, it was a complex endeavor to bring into relief the ways that   71  my adolescent students were using language to respond to characters, all teens (except Melanin Sun’s mother), with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex identities.    Figure 1. Emergent themes in data   What happens when students engage in a study of queer YA lit?

(interviews) Queer inclusive (culturally responsive) literature, text, media Teaching \"against the tide\" of heteronormativity (Therapeutic) collaboration and developing (queer) pedagogies   72  My foci were to analyze what happens when students study and read queer inclusive YA literature in a unit that intends to disrupt heteronormativity and to analyze their interpretations of diverse sexualities and genders. I applied my studies of cultural relevance, adolescent literacy, and queer pedagogy to inform my analyses of students’ interpretive stances and practices in an attempt to answer the research questions.  This was not a study in which I could show the ways their responses changed over time, but it was one that examined some of what they did, said, and wrote as they learned and read about LGBTQIA*+  themes.18 Because such learning is a rarity in schools, and schools are institutionally resistant to challenging antiquated, status quo notions of sexuality and gender, my aim was to show the value and necessity of such teaching, as it engaged students in sophisticated, close readings of texts, even as it revealed that assumptions about queer identities continue to be made and more work has to be done. My Role(s) as Researcher  As Practitioner  I believe that cultural relevance and sociocultural approaches to literacy are increasingly important in the 21st century. Research that supports the necessity for teaching LGBTQIA*+ literature and queer-inclusive curriculum in English classes is of great urgency. Even though my review of queer pedagogy has brought my awareness to the insufficiency of defining my identity with these labels, I do so for the purposes of calling attention to my positionality. I am a cisgender, heterosexual-partnered, middle-class, middle-aged White woman who teaches                                                 18 In addition to reading two YA novels in a small group of their peers in a book club, students read, discussed, and wrote responses to a collection of nonfiction text and media. I did not include their written responses to these materials as data because the focus of the study is on the nine selected queer themed YA fiction. However, since the selection of the supplementary texts was designed to support students’ learning by studying shared texts that could enhance their understanding of LGBTQIA*+ content using culturally relevant, multimodal texts, and could aid in both disrupting the heteronormative school space and position students as queer allies, a list of all the texts is on Table 4.   73  predominantly Hispanic and African American students in a Title I or “high-poverty” secondary school.  One of the reasons I became an English teacher and, subsequently, a doctoral student is because I believe that public education and youth will determine the course of our democracy. I view my teaching practice as an opportunity to participate in social action that seeks social justice for all people regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, class, sexuality, gender expression, age, religion, or ability. Yet, teaching and teaching for social change can be extraordinarily exhausting and heartbreaking work. There are times it is a challenge to sustain hope, especially in a political climate that frightens and enrages many of my students and colleagues.  I bring a pedagogy of love to my practice and am out about my passion for social justice and equity. I continue to reflect on what it means to be a White teacher who teaches primarily students of color. I love my students and I love this work, which means I am invested in a teaching and learning community that demands I challenge myself and others to interrogate inherent bias and regularly reflect on my practice. Recently, the school’s principal invited staff developers from Border Crossings to do a two-session workshop on inherent bias and teaching race. There is certainly more work to do. Much of my work as a teacher of English centers on pedagogy that supports and facilitates students engaging in critical close readings, discussions about race, gender, class, and written responses to text. However, my participation in the Border Crossings workshops revealed that I do not always “name race” in my pedagogical practice and curricula, and that I must continue to learn to grow my efforts to be an anti-racist White teacher who works to disrupt White supremacy.   74  As Practitioner Researcher I am conducting this research in the high school where I have taught for my entire 18-year teaching career. The decision to study my own classroom and a curriculum designed collaboratively came while I was writing my preliminary review of the literature. The research design draws on two studies: (a) a study of a queer literature course in a New England high school (Helmer, 2015), which found a critical multidimensional approach to queer literacy pedagogy; and (b) a study that examined a collection of LGBT-themed books selected for an out-of-school reading group (Blackburn et al., 2015) to illuminate the features of queer literature and its potential for disrupting heteronormativity.  Since I am one of two ninth-grade English teachers, the expectation is that the curriculum is collaboratively planned and designed. Fortunately, my teaching colleague was willing to teach this curriculum to her students (from whom I did not collect artifacts), which took the place of another book club unit that focused on texts written by female authors. My colleague and I designed the unit, along with two other teachers, a student teacher who was peripherally involved in the planning and teaching, and a member of the faculty who helped us select and order the books.19 As Ally I was a high school student in the late 1980s during the height of the AIDS epidemic, and I did not know a single gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender person. No one was out. The word “faggot” was one of the most common insults used to mock, tease, or harass another student. It was the worst thing you could call someone. Most schools continue to serve as hostile environments for anyone who does not identify as heterosexual and are generally heteronormative, homophobic institutions (Blackburn, 2005).                                                 19 Here, I do not specify the teaching roles (titles) of the participants to protect their anonymity.   75  There were no books, films, or historical references to queer people in my high school’s curriculum. President Ronald Reagan refused to acknowledge the gay community and would not say the word “AIDS,” even though thousands of Americans were dying preventable deaths during his presidency. More than half of the citizens of the United States were in favor of quarantine for people with AIDS.  I remember coming home from college for my first Thanksgiving break and arguing with my father about the quarantine as a human rights violation. I asked him if he would send me away if I had AIDS. When he quickly answered that he would not, I asked him why he would send someone else’s daughter or son away. He could not answer. He may have thought I was coming out to him. I was not. But at the time he believed what many people at the time did—that AIDS was a gay disease and that gay people were getting what they deserved.  This sickened me. During my third year of college, one of my closest friends, a fellow English major, approached me after poetry workshop class to say he wanted to talk to me. Alone. As we took separate cars to my apartment, I wonder/ed what he could possibly want to talk to me about. But at my kitchen table, he just smiled and said, “I just wanted to let you know that I am gay.” I smiled too, and then we laughed and hugged. It was such an honor. I was the second person he told. I think I must have already had an inkling, but at the time it was a big deal. A coming out. My journey as a queer ally began to percolate there. Years later, I sat across from my sister as she told me over beers at a grimy punk rock bar on Avenue B that she too was gay. “I know!” I blurted out almost at the same time and we laughed hysterically. She cried, then I cried. We hugged and I told her that I was so very proud of her. She was beaming. I have been patiently expecting this for years.    76  Not long after, our mother called in a panic to say that our adult brother, who lives in a group home and has an intellectual disability, autism, and developmental delays, was also gay. This was complicated. Because of his cognitive disabilities, he could not legally consent to sex and lived in a house that is partially funded by a Catholic organization near the east end of Long Island, a politically conservative area. If he were heterosexual, I believe he would qualify for a supervised dating program, but since he was not, he did not.  A few weeks after our father passed away, my sister came out once again—this time to say that she was transgender, would transition from female to male, would legally change her first name to Vaughn, and to please use he, him, his pronouns from now on. I was bewildered. This felt like a rug being pulled out from under me. I was grieving our father and then I was grieving her. I hurt her—no, him—with this reaction and attend/ed a family meeting for families of people who are transitioning at The Center in NYC. I quickly learned that my initial response, while it might have been understandable, was selfish.  As a cisgender woman, I examined my privilege. I also began to sharpen my critique of the ways that gender, socially constructed and maintained by society’s rigidly defined expectations, can hurt everyone. I reflect/ed on the trauma that I have endured as a direct result of having a female body. My focus turned to Vaughn who received my wholehearted support, despite my initial failure to do so, as he began his transition and came out to everyone he knew on Facebook—changing his profile name and picture. Soon after, I was horrified and incredibly fearful when he told me that, while walking to the subway near his apartment on a date with his partner, a group of young men called him “bitch” and “faggot,” as they laughed, argued among themselves about which one he was, and then determined, “That’s a bitch.”    77  Clearly, this work is personal. I want to contribute to a growing body of research that supports LGBTQIA*+ youth and curriculum that is culturally responsive and disruptive of oppressive antiquated teaching that does nothing to challenge the White, racist, patriarchal heteronormativity that has plagued the nation since its inception. To sustain the hard, heartbreaking work of teaching, I am reminded that I entered the profession to contribute to social change and a passion for equity. I teach in a place that values (and demands) that teachers are reflective, collaborative, and passionate about literacy as a tool of liberation. But there is more work to be done. As such, my aim as a practitioner researcher is to illuminate what can be learned by attempting to use literacy to counter oppression and heteronormativity in a classroom that values love, respect, and young adults. Reciprocity This research posed minimal risks for participants. Participation in this study was solely voluntary, and there was no monetary compensation or gift incentive offered to the teachers who consented to participate. I am not an administrator or coach, so there was no potential for participants to be unwittingly coerced by the potential for professional favoritism.   All participants received an informed consent form that was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Teachers College and the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE). I ensured that participants consented to be audio-recorded by asking them to sign an “Informed Consent” document prior to being interviewed. All participants’ confidentiality will be protected in my researcher’s notes by the use of pseudonyms.  There were no benefits for participating in the study, and yet it was one of my aims as a practitioner researcher in a collaborative teaching community that this study offer important insights into teaching a critical queer pedagogy. There was also the possibility that administrators   78  will seek professional development to encourage colleagues, and schools across the city, to engage in and contribute to professional and scholarly discourse that supports queer-inclusive teaching.  Contribution to the Field I am confident that this research offers much needed scholarship on queer-inclusive teaching and critical pedagogy that aims to disrupt intersectional oppression and make English classrooms powerful sites of learning, love, and safety for all children, adolescents, and their teachers. Illuminating the work of practitioners who seek to expand hegemonic notions of the teaching of English so that it is at once intellectually rigorous, liberatory, culturally relevant, and humanizing is increasingly important in the fields of English education, literacy research, secondary education, and teacher education in the 21st century. It is my aim to offer a pedagogical framework for teachers and teacher educators to teach queer-inclusive curriculum. My position as a teacher gave me a unique perspective that enabled me to conduct practitioner research that will contribute to a growing body of research that supports teaching queer inclusive curriculum. As outlined in Chapter II, there is a lack of teacher training (and even resistance) toward teaching that addresses or acknowledges intersectionality, sexuality and gender, or the existence of LGBTQIA+* people.     79  Chapter IV FINDINGS Part I What happens when ninth-grade students engage in a study of YA queer literature in a public, Title I, queer-friendly high school in New York City? ● How does reading and writing that centers on analyzing YA queer literature reinforce or disrupt normative discourses about LGBTQ youth? Across the data, I analyzed to examine RQ1 (teaching memos, student artifacts,1 and interviews), the following themes emerged: Queer visibility: cultural relevance, affirming identity, empowerment; Empathy: building bridges that humanize and disrupt oppression; and Moments of discomfort: resistance, reifying normative discourses about identity, and encountering homophobia/transphobia. Sometimes the theme was emergent in an interpretive practice that appeared in the data source (i.e., what happens when…), and at others, there was evidence of the theme in a choice a participant made: a citation they chose to respond to and the way(s) that it landed for them (i.e., how does analysis of queer text reinforce or disrupt normative discourses…). Next, I elaborate on and further describe the themes that emerged and their attendant codes. Queer Visibility: Cultural Relevance, Affirming Identity, Empowerment Queer identities, in a heteronormative society, are associated with sexualities and gender presentations that fall outside of dominant binaries (i.e. straight/gay, man/woman) that have a history of being marginalized, pathologized, and dehumanized. Therefore, queer, as it pertains to LGBTQIA*+ identities, remains invisible, “closeted,” out of sight. As I analyzed the teaching                                                 1 See Table 5 (in Chapter III) for the number of artifacts collected from each of the 44 students. See Table 7 for descriptions of the central characters in each of the YA novels to which the students wrote responses.   80  memos, artifacts, and interview transcripts to answer RQ1, the importance of queer visibility emerged. When students encounter queer identities in literature, heteronormativity is destabilized and status quo notions of sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, and gender expression are challenged. Queer visibility in a school space is actually quite radical, considering that most English curricula are not inclusive of any LGBTQ topics or literature (Blackburn & Buckley, 2005). These data suggested that queer visibility in the curriculum, as it pertains to teaching YA LGBTQIA*+ themed literature in a high school English classroom context, is culturally responsive as it is a genre that seeks to engage and empower queer youth and, thus, all youth. Cultural relevance stands as its own code within this theme as there were many instances in which participants identified with and made a connection to the empowerment of teenage identity. Since the student artifact data were written responses to the two YA novels they read in their book club, Table 7 provides a brief annotation about the central characters and conflict in each. Queer Visibility: Enter Queer Content Sofia2 rushes up to me before class begins, gushing about Kristin3, the protagonist of None of the Above. “I thought she was female, but she’s not!” At first, I am not sure what to think because Sofia is referring to Kristin’s intersex diagnosis, which is revealed early in the novel, but in my teaching memo, I am able to reflect on the significance of the exchange. It was initially worrisome that Sofia seemed to be subscribing to a gender binary, but when I considered                                                  2 See Table 5, in Chapter III for a list of students (all names are pseudonyms) in class 1 and class 2, the number of artifacts they submitted. I have also listed their gender and race.  3 See Table 7 for annotations on central characters in each of the nine YA novels.    81  Table 7  Descriptions of LGBTQIA*+ Characters in the YA Novels Ninth Grade in Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Club Unit ____________________________________________________________________________  Title      Central Characters ____________________________________________________________________________  None of the Above   Kristin learns she has AIS, an intersex condition.  Sam, Kristin’s ex-boyfriend, rejects her and writes transphobic hate speech on her locker.  We Are Okay     Marin has a sexual relationship with her best friend Mabel, but  that all changes when she loses her grandfather and leaves for college without saying goodbye.  Once in college, Mabel starts a relationship with Jake.  Two Boys Kissing   Craig and Harry are ex-boyfriends trying to break the world’s  record for longest kiss.  Tariq, their friend, is violently attacked and hospitalized-targeted for being gay and African American.  Peter and Neil are a couple.  Avery, a trans boy, starts dating Ryan.  Cooper is in the closet, and his parents are outwardly homophobic.  I’ll Give You the Sun.   Jude, once carefree and confident, undergoes a transformation after      a traumatic sexual encounter with an older boy. Noah, her twin, is able to stifle his sexuality until he meets Brian.     Brian likes Noah but is a star athlete worried about his future.  If I Was Your Girl   Amanda moves in with her dad shortly after she transitions from  male to female to have a fresh start in a new school. Bee is bisexual and develops a crush on Amanda. Chloe, Bee’s ex, is jealous of the friendship between them. Grant pursues Amanda, who likes him but is reluctant, concerned about disclosure.  Aristotle and Dante   Aristotle struggles to acknowledge that he is falling in love with Discover the Secrets of  his best friend Dante.  the Universe    Ari’s parents are largely silent about his brother, who is in prison      for murder.     Dante acknowledges the growing attraction between them. His     parents (and later, Ari’s parents) offer love and acceptance.      82  Table 7 (continued) ____________________________________________________________________________  Title      Central Characters ____________________________________________________________________________  Boyfriends With   Allie has a boyfriend who she breaks up with because she desires Girlfriends   Kimiko. Kimiko, who desires Allie, is a lesbian who eventually comes out to her very traditional Japanese parents.  Lance is gay, desires Sergio, and wants to avoid the same pitfalls as his previous relationship, with a closeted gay boy. Sergio, a Chicano, out bi teenager, desires Lance, but does not want to commit after a recent breakup with a girl.  From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun is 14 and distraught when his mom, EC, reveals  Melanin Sun: A Novel  she is in love with Kristin, and that she is White. Melanin’s friend Sean and his frequent use of homophobic language make it especially difficult for Melanin. Melanin’s other friend Ralphael’s acceptance of EC encourages him to do the same.  The House You Pass   Staggerlee, a biracial 14-year-old, is questioning her sexuality on the Way   but is supported by her cousin Trout (who has also kissed a girl)  when she comes to stay for the summer. ______________________________________________________________________________  it further, that is not what was happening. Asking students to read a novel that features an intersex character disrupts the binary in fundamental ways, it queers the gender binary. This seemed to invigorate Sofia. Sofia’s excitement and engagement were also remarkable because it was the first time she shared a passion for what she was reading—a book that I assigned that she had to read on her own, in a small group of peers (and without an adult pleading with her to read on, as with most of the other course texts in ninth-grade English). Sofia is not a reluctant reader, but had previously shared she lacked motivation and that she is very opinionated about what the class reads in English class.    83  When I revisit my teaching memos, I am also reminded of another exchange with Sofia. We were finishing a unit on gender norms and Euripides’ Medea and she wanted to know what our next unit was. When I told her we would be studying LGBT literature, she was elated. “That’s my unit4!”  In an interview with my colleague Anna, an out lesbian who has been teaching at Pearl Street for over 18 years, she reports that visitors to the school have said, “Oh my gosh! I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many rainbow flags. Is everybody queer in your school?” Anna, an avid reader of queer YA fiction, has initiated many of the conversations and professional development initiatives around LGBTQ topics and queer-inclusive literature selection. She has curated a special collection of LGBTQIA*+ books for the school’s library and has shared the catalog with the entire NYCDOE school system so that educators around the city can select queer-inclusive books for their school libraries. Anna assisted me in making the final list of books for the unit and ordering them. She says, “I think books are an incredibly successful way for people to explore these really foreign ideas around gender.” Anna added that Boyfriends With Girlfriends “continues to be a little bit radical—about whether people can truly be bi...nobody was telling that story when [Sanchez] wrote the book. No one.” Beyond Queer Visibility: Queer Empowerment  During an Accountable Talk discussion, a form of assessment that is similar to a Socratic seminar that students prepare for by bringing in annotations, questions and big ideas about course texts, Olivia5 posits that disturbing the master narrative is important, and refers again to                                                 4 At the time, I am not aware that Sofia is bisexual. I initially interpret her saying “my unit” to mean (correctly) that she is eager to begin the unit, but do not realize she is also claiming its relevance to her experience. 5 Again, see Table 5, in Chapter III for a list of students (all names are pseudonyms) in class 1 and class 2, the number of artifacts they submitted. I have also listed their gender and race.    84  the skate video. Saying that [Rachelle6] was insecure and the boys laughed at her. But she proved them all wrong and did her own thing. In class 2, Jordan also presents the importance of Rachelle finding her people and thus acceptance, and how this propelled her skating ability. He posits that Marin,7 the protagonist of We Are Okay, “was gay and everyone treated it like it was nothing—it was normal.” Inez adds on, suggesting that We Are Okay shows it does not matter that Marin is gay. It is just another part of someone’s personality. If this were not a student-led discussion, I would have interjected to ask her to elaborate. I find this a compelling choice of words. that she describes a character’s sexuality as part of their personality and wonder if she was misunderstanding what the word personality means. I also find it interesting that the students who read the novel suggest that Marin’s sexuality does not matter. Kaito adds that there are supporters in every story, referring to the article about Bean and Luvello and Two Boys Kissing. “There are gay people coming out.” “True,” says Kayson. He cites “the High Five8“ film about Glenn Burke, the 1977 LA Dodgers rookie who, it has been speculated, was traded to the Oakland A’s because he was gay. “That wasn’t right, but [Burke] had support from the gay community.” Abigail adds that when that baseball player [Billy Bean] came out, he didn’t want to disrupt the game and people began to accept him. Cultural (Queer) Relevance Cameron is engaged during a small group read-aloud of the short story “Am I Blue?” (Coville, 1994) in my English enrichment class (offered to students who I want to provide additional reading and writing skill support) and asks what gaydar is. I laugh when I do not realize how dated the term is until that very moment. We discuss the ways that the notion of                                                 6 See Table 4 for descriptions of the text and media students read during the unit. 7 See Table 7 for annotations on central characters in each of the 9 YA novels.  8 See Table 4 for descriptions of the text and media students read during the unit.   85  “gaydar” is problematic because it rests on assumptions of heteronormativity. Then we discuss Jay-Z’s recent interview on the Netflix series My Next Guest with David Letterman when Jay Z talks about the N-word being problematic as it was the last word that a person of color would hear before they were murdered. We compare this to the F-word when the fairy godfather in the story tells of being murdered for being gay. Diego9 engages Kervens in thoughtful discussion in their first book club meeting to discuss Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe. Diego predicts that Ari’s relationship with his parents will become a source of tension later, and wonders why they will not talk to him about his older brother in prison. Prior to this unit, I learn that Diego is the younger half-brother of a former student, who is now in his first year of college. They are very close and everyone in the family was emotional when they dropped him off. Olivia wants to speak to me privately about issues at home—an argument with her mom, who is threatening to move to Florida and take her with her. Olivia reveals that she feels torn apart by her mother and father, who no longer live together. I share how challenging it was for me at her age to navigate my own parents’ divorce and consequent estrangement. Olivia is able to come back to class after our heart to heart. Teen Identity (and Empowerment) as Cultural Relevance On the first day of the unit, students watch and analyze two short films and were asked what each was suggesting or disrupting about gender norms. The short film “That One Day” featuring Rachelle Vinberg and the rad skate girls of the real-life all girl skate crew Skate Kitchen in NYC piqued Sofia and Olivia’s interest. They share with the whole class that they want to try skateboarding now, because “she made it look so cool.” Sofia adds that she likes                                                 9 See Table 6, in Chapter III for the leveled book club groups in class 1 and 2.   86  seeing how all of the other girls helped Rachelle, who through this support is able to get better at skateboarding and take her skills back to the male-dominated skate park with her new friends.  Kaito, an emerging skateboarder and amateur filmmaker himself, is aghast. “My friends made this,” he says, referring to the cast and not the director. Kaito is becoming a well-known skater. He and Jordan (in class 2) are featured in a 2017 New York Times photo essay on skateboard culture in the East Village of NYC.10 Even though my choice of this text was deliberately made to engage him and Jordan, I do not predict the significance of this to Kaito, and I wonder whether he will be more engaged now that a short skateboarding film has been included in the curriculum.  Affirming Identities Interestingly, toward the conclusion of the accountable talk discussion in both classes 1 and 2 (again, these are discussions that the students themselves facilitate, using their prepared questions and statements, and my role is as an observer/coach), students ask their peers to share what they think is the biggest idea across all of the texts studied thus far. Their responses: Class 1: Olivia: People should be okay with who they are and not hide themselves because of other people.  Kaito: If a homophobe watches these videos and reads these books, will they change?  Olivia: People will be more open when they see more [queer] people. Then [queer people] will feel more power to be themselves.  Antonio: Today it is better. Never let someone put you down.  Sofia: Race and religion is part of it. My family is Catholic but I am atheist. Be yourself no matter what the situation is.                                                    10 I have not cited the NYT article, published in 2017, to maintain Kaito and Jordan’s anonymity.   87  Class 2: Sebastian: Over time, a community forms.  Kervens: People have been more accepting in recent years.  Danielle: People can like who they want.  Aaron: There should be more awareness.  Jordan: There will come a time when it won’t matter and people like who they like. It’s whatever. There’s no reason to hate other people.  Inez: Being gay is not wrong. There’s shows and books. It’s out in the open.  Students in my class 2 are shocked that Harvey Milk is assassinated during a discussion of a short biographical text we read on Harvey Milk Day. Students in class 1 are even more engaged when Mateo asks them to consider Milk’s experience.  Personal Connections: (Queer) Windows and Mirrors During the accountable talk discussion I discussed earlier, Olivia adds, “People are scared to come out because they don’t want to be judged. Like myself. When I started dating girls people said, ‘I didn’t think you were like that.’” This is the first time in English class that Olivia has referred to her sexuality. Later she adds, “I always accepted my [gay] cousin. He made it easier for me. He told me not to be afraid because everyone will have to be okay because it is who you are.” Sofia adds that her father is more open because she cannot get pregnant, but that her mother is more old-fashioned and wants to meet whomever she is dating. Sofia has already come out to me in the form of an exit slip response, that I collect from students at the end of the first day of the unit. She writes, “I am a proud bisexual teenager.” I presume the rest of the students know that she identifies herself as bisexual, and the discussion proceeds.   88  In class 2, Sebastian says, “Before I came out as trans [male], people used to bully me because I did not look like a stereotypical girl.” Jordan adds, “My older sister is bi and it went unsaid… I always knew because she said stuff about girls.” Queer Visibility, Cultural (Queer) Relevance, and Empowerment Across the YA Novels One of the ideas that really started to crystallize in my analysis of the students’ artifacts was that they were finding common experiences as teenagers with the queer characters across the novels, which affirmed the decision to use exclusively YA fiction for the book club and served to aid in disrupting dominant discourses about queer youth. They noticed empowered queer characters (who learned to overcome obstacles, self-accept). Another idea that seems strong after analyzing the artifacts is the theme of identity and that the (queer) characters across the novels were in the process of “finding themselves” or “figuring it out” which serves to both disrupt and reinforce normative discourses about LGBTQ youth. Some of the students’ responses also used the word “secrets” repeatedly, which connects to themes of coming out, and their commentary, reactions, and opinions about the characters’ experiences with visibility. (I also wonder if time is a possible concept to discuss here, as some students seemed to connect coming out, identity, and both self and societal acceptance as shifting with time [i.e., in the past people are not accepting but future generations will be, over time you learn to love yourself and then others do too…].) The YA novels, and the students’ written responses to and their viewpoints about the relevance of queer-inclusive literature, contained much that is worth citing here: Boyfriends With Girlfriends 11 Antonio: What makes this world so great [is] that everyone is different in their own way. That is what makes life fun and how you meet new people and friends.  Hazel: Lance and Sergio are starting to be more loving toward each other.                                                  11 Again, see Table 7, contained previously in this chapter, for descriptions of central characters in each of the YA novels that students read in their book clubs.   89  Berto: Although Sergio likes Lance, and feels a connection between them, he still needs time to relax and cherish the moments he has as a [newly] single person.  Cameron: Allie feels as if she should get closer to Kimiko to let her know that she has a thing for her but just doesn’t know how she would react.  The House You Pass On the Way “Her father had said African Americans were all mixed up-not just the out-and-out mixed-race kids, but that all black people weren’t a hundred percent African unless they never left Africa.” (Woodson, 2010, p. 28) Antonio: People be scared just because they are different from everyone else...people need to feel more good about where they come from and feel proud that they are mixed. Alexa: ...friendships need to be truthful...because those friends may mean a lot to you and also have a big impact in life whether its for the future or getting through a tough situation.  From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun “Trying hard to get ahold of yourself from all the many places you are when you’re almost fourteen? Where would you be?” (Woodson, 1995, p. 5)  Emerson: This really makes me think about my life and the peers in my life also.  Berto: Ralphael is really a true friend. He is trying to accept the fact that Melanin’s mom is gay and he will defend him no matter what.  Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe Why do we smile? Why do we laugh? Why do we feel alone? Why are we sad and confused? Why do we read poetry? Why do we cry when we see a painting?  Why is there a riot in the heart when we feel love? Why do we feel shame? What is that thing in the pit of your stomach called desire? (Saenz, 2014, n.p.)  I placed this block quote here, from the beginning of the novel, as a reminder that one drawback of a book club is that students do not always read the Forewords or Acknowledgments pages in front of a text. When I teach this unit again, I would ask students to analyze this quote by first answering each of the questions, and then asking for their critiques. Why did the author place it at the front of this book? What can be learned from discussing it? Margarita: Ari and Dante get each other because they both feel that they aren’t heard. But they hear each other which is why they click so well… Society drilled into [Ari’s] head that liking boys wasn’t a question that he needed answered, he assumed since that’s what he’s been surrounded by. But he broke that narrative when he still decided to kiss Dante.    90  Olivia: I do not want to write about the book but I’d like to write about my story. I am bisexual and coming out was not really hard for me. I was in eighth grade, and me and Sofia had started discovering ourselves. I am not ashamed to say that I am bi-sexual. I am actually proud of who I am.  None of the Above “The common thread from all those stories was that talking helped, and listening, and time. One day I would find my own place. I couldn’t run there, though, because it didn’t exist yet. I had to build it myself, out of forgiveness, truth...” (Gregorio, 2015, p. 305).  “...love isn’t a choice. You fall for the person, not their chromosomes” (Gregorio, 2015, p. 324) Sebastian: Kristin has just found out that she’s intersex and has male parts. She has a fear that Sam will break up with her.  Josiah: This book is giving new information on new things to people which is good on the author’s part.  Kayson: Things will get messy with [Kristin’s] boyfriend all this will bring her grades down which will affect her scholarship.  Maria: Jessica doesn’t even care about how Kristin has a different chromosome...she is being very supportive of Kristin’s diagnosis.  Vicente: I’m in a relationship-communicating is the most important thing and without it how can you know each other.  Aliyah: Everyone has the right to be the gender that best identifies them. People need to respect that and learn to treat people with respect and like everyone else.  Kervens: Kristin finally comes to accept who she is.  Alex: I don’t think [the surgery] will change much-only the outside and not the inside. Hoping to see Kristin feel better about herself… I feel like Darren and Kristin should be together. Forget Sam. Darren doesn’t even touch the subject of Kristin being intersex. He talks about normal conversations and hangs with her. I think she will start doing some healing from this point on. The old past has made Kristin learn many things that has made her change, and having a new change in life is beautiful to her. Every person who’s different is beautiful.  Bernardo: I think that Darren is a good and humble human being that has such a kind heart.  Danielle: [Kristin] experienced some hurtful things however she rose above. She lost her boyfriend, one of her best friends, track team, and her ability to be a mother. But she got   91  a better boyfriend, her best friend back, the track team back, and the knowledge of being able to adopt.  If I Was Your Girl “Maybe secrets and lies were part of life; maybe everyone had something they were lying to themselves about, or something they were hiding.” (Russo, 2017, p. 89)  Margarita: This quote hits really hard because it’s what most teenagers feel and think including me. Because it’s like no matter if you play the game correctly there is always someone that is disappointed or unpleased. And by lying it helps save you from the feeling of disappointing someone.  “I was finally a girl on the outside too; there was nothing separating me from my body anymore” (Russo, 2017, p. 185).  Margarita: [Amanda] finally feels like she is who she should be, like she’s in her own skin, which shows liberation in her.  Sofia: This is very meaningful. It is the first time in years that Amanda has seen her dad. It was as if Amanda was a new person in the town like if everybody really excepted [sic] her like a girl.  Kayson: This can mean a lot of things for Amanda. It makes the reader think about whether or not her boyfriend knows her secret. This made me want to keep reading and that’s just what I did : ). [smiley face drawn by Kayson]  Alex: Just even someone acting normal to a queer person is something that makes meaning in people’s lives… Amanda has at least some family that is growing around her and supporting. I think [by the end of the novel] she has changed. Much more brave and fierce to do anything she can. She can do what she wants to do.  Aliyah: Even though Grant’s intentions were pure and genuine, Amanda still believes that they’re going to taunt her after all the things she’s been through.  Aaron: Amanda starts to finally accept herself at the end of the book. She finally comes to see it doesn’t matter what others say or think, it only matters what she thinks of herself.  Alex, a student in class 2 who subverts gender norms with long, sculpted fingernails, responded often to characters in None of the Above and If I Was Your Girl who he noticed were lying about who they were: to themselves and others. Many of Alex’s responses were dialogic between himself and the text, with interpretations that provided a roadmap of Alex’s thinking   92  and ideas about the novels. So the written responses for Alex were crucial because he did not speak during the accountable talk and some of the book club discussions. An unforeseen and possible benefit to teaching this unit is that students have the opportunity to write much of their commentary and analysis of the novels, rendering their experiences with the text more intimate--between student and teacher. I’ll Give You the Sun “I can always tell what’s in Jude’s head. It’s not easy for her to tell what’s in mine, though, because I have shutters and I close them whenever I have to. Like lately. (Self-portrait: The boy hiding inside the boy hiding inside the boy). (Nelson, 2015, p. 16)  Bernardo: …[here] the author uses Noah to challenge social constructs...and people look at [Jude] and they deny her worth. I relate to this sometimes I put tons of effort into things and sometimes my work is undervalued. One time I put odee work into a history essay and got a 74. I was in shock.  Two Boys Kissing “Dreaming and loving and screwing. None of these things are identities. Maybe when other people look at us, but not to ourselves. We are so much more complicated than that” (Levithan, 2015, p. 6)  Emilia: This quote conveys how your exterior and what people view of you isn’t who you are. Who you are is far more complicated than others’ image of you. Your exterior is a veil to your actual identity. It blurs people from seeing your identity. The chorus might be significant in this story by helping characters discover themselves.  On the Relevance of Reading Queer-Inclusive (YA) Literature:  Excerpts From Students’ Book Reviews 12  Hazel: In both stories [Boyfriends With Girlfriends and The House You Pass On the Way] the characters struggle with harsh labels but I learned that we shouldn’t let labels define us. The label that is tagged on you should not be about who u date or hang out with, it should be what you pick or no label at all.  Cameron: When I first saw the book cover for Boyfriends With Girlfriends13 I judged it by its cover especially because I don’t read books about LGBT people… reading this book taught me that teenagers can turn out to have feelings for one another.                                                  12 See Appendix C for a description of the Book Review Assignment that students wrote after they read two YA novels. 13 See Figure 2.   93  Antonio: It’s important to read literature that disrupts dominant narratives in school because school can be a hard time for the people who don’t follow gender norms...they will get bullied and they will feel like they don’t belong in this world… This world needs to change. You don’t have to do anything you will be perfect just the way you are… never be scared to be yourself and show the world that because every day you will change the world.  Maia: A book that has the ability to make a person question society and have them strive for justice in an unjust society is a strong and empowering book. Two Boys Kissing was able to push my own thinking about society and help me to further understand how I can make my own change to this unjust society we live in….  Bernardo: [None of the Above] made me question whether or not I should judge people because of their different characteristics from “normal” human beings, or if I should take time to get to know a person before being so judgemental.  Inez: But after reading We Are Okay, I found myself asking why does our society think it is wrong to be a part of the LGBTQ community when love is love? And why should there be a limit as to who we can and cannot love?  Sofia: Something I really enjoyed about [None of the Above] is that it talks about a lot of situations that would happen in high school on a day to day basis. Some books don’t know how to relate to this generation while talking about high school because they are adults and do not really know what happens these days. But Gregorio made it clear that she understands what is going on. This is really enjoyable for me because it makes me want to read the story even more. It feels like I am a character in the book watching all these events happening to me. Having the reader connect with the book is very important because it keeps them interested and wanting to continue to read the book.  Alex: If I Was Your Girl is a book where a future can be made and no past is gonna stop anyone from achieving anyone’s goals. Many readers and especially teenagers will be enjoying and learning from what this book holds… I.W. Gregorio is sharing the fact that people are blamed for who and what they are. I like the fact that [Kristin] has supporters, and especially her dad that is reasonable and helps out. [None of the Above] conveys that there is acceptance, not only that but to not give up. There are people who can help… I.W. Gregorio and Meredith Russo both wrote about two protagonists’ life’s relationship and life falling apart because of their differences...yet they are still loved for who they are.  Danielle: In [None of the Above and If I Was Your Girl] there are many similarities. They are both about girls who are questioned about their gender, their secrets are exposed in ways that are extreme and in front of the whole school, once their secret is out they both lost their boyfriends, both had violent experiences when their secret was out...They are both written in a way that a high schooler would speak, the dialogue also has the terms that teenagers use.    94  Diego: [Aristotle and Dante] are gay and society teaches us that being gay is bad or weird because of many reasons. They are also Mexican and society doesn’t tend to think or assume that Mexicans would be gay. Saenz does a good job with disrupting those dominant narratives throughout the book.  There were moments during coding when lines were blurry, especially between queer visibility and empathy because responses that highlighted queer identity, cultural relevance, and empowerment were by their very nature humanizing. But it is still meaningful work to attempt to distinguish the data that served to highlight queer identity because of the myriad ways sexuality and gender identity are policed and stigmatized, especially in schools. The next theme and its attendant codes attempt to underscore empathy and how students’ expressions of empathy for fictional characters serves to foreground the humanity of diverse sexualities and genders and by so doing disrupt oppressive narratives about sexuality and gender. Empathy: Building Bridges That Humanize and Disrupt Oppression Literacy has the transformative power to save lives, as it restores love and humanity to an otherwise hostile, racially and economically segregated, heteronormative world. Critical literacy works to analyze and destabilize oppressive forces that aim to maintain the status quo. Here I suggest that empathy is vital to critical reading and engagement with fiction. I suspect that empathy is most emergent when it comes to curricula that aim to dismantle oppression in its myriad forms because of the ways that literature study helps remind us of our humanity and gives us the potential to envision a better world. In addition, when I posit cultural relevance as inclusive of teenage identity (as I discussed in the previous section), this serves to facilitate empathy because of the likelihood of identification and literature as mirrors and windows (Sims, 1982). However, here I attempt to distinguish cultural relevance from empathy while simultaneously drawing parallels to queer visibility as the three themes intersect, even as I try to set them apart. Queer-inclusive curriculum has been largely absent from schools and while it has   95  begun to appear in the literature about cultural relevance, my goal is to examine empathy as a literacy practice that appeared in both teacher/student classroom discourse and students’ written responses to queer inclusive text.  The empathic stance that predominated in the student artifacts stands to contradict the notion that pervades popular culture and discourse: that youth are self-centered, technology-obsessed narcissists. The data suggested that analyzing queer literature moves students to build empathy, disrupts oppression and humanizes people of all identities, thus empowering youth as producers and consumers of knowledge that facilitates their growth, and supports queer and questioning youth.  Building Bridges That Humanize       People should get to be people without being put into one of societies suffocating boxes. It’s important we read literature that disrupts dominant narratives so people know not to do this. (Danielle)  The above quote, made by Danielle in class 2, is an apt subtitle for this section, which reveals students (and teachers) engaging in humanizing literacies, connecting what they are reading to how they view (their place in) the world, how others should be treated, and why it matters. In my teaching memos, I write that Margarita, an otherwise reserved young person, was the first to put her hand up when I asked for students’ reactions to “That One Day”14 and what it revealed about gender norms. She says it is not a gender thing. It is a human thing. Everyone feels lonely sometimes and wants to be accepted and loved. Kenneth adds that the video teaches empathy, especially when the girls in the film see that the main character is not being treated equally (by the boys) at the skatepark.                                                  14 Again, see Table 4 in Chapter III for annotations on all text and media in the ninth-grade unit.   96  The next day, in class 2, Jordan says that the Yoruba Richen Ted Talk about the connections between the civil rights movement and the LGBT civil rights movements and the “Power of a Single Conversation” video about Prop 8 are connected by the theme of love. Some of his classmates (whose names I did not list in my teaching memo of that day) add that it is powerful the way that people change their minds (about support for Prop 8) after hearing someone’s story, and how it affects them to not be able to marry who they love. Aaron explains that the man (who answered his door to talk to a queer activist) had never before come into contact with any gay or trans people. But then when she (the activist) explains that she has a wife and loves her as much as he loves his wife. In class 1, Sofia suggests that “it is different if you know someone or a family member is LGBT.” During our interview, Cassandra reveals that reading Two Boys Kissing—one of her favorite titles selected for the book club unit—was a transformative journey and a very emotional experience. She tells me that her mother’s best friend died of AIDS when she was a child. Cassandra believes that reading this book in high school would have helped her understand what her mother was going through and be able to better support her through that very difficult period. Cassandra gave the book to her mom when she finished reading it.  During the accountable talk discussion across all of the texts, Emerson says that in From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun,15 Melanin’s mother was probably so surprised and sad [that her son initially didn’t accept her when she came out]. Antonio writes:      Jacqueline Woodson is an African American lesbian author and she writes [The House You Pass on the Way] to show things she might go through, and what her daughter Toshi might go through. Her daughter has two moms and this might be a good book for her.                                                  15 Again, see Table 7 previously contained in this chapter for descriptions of central characters in the YA novels.   97  During our interview, my colleague Rosaline reflects on the last day of the unit when students presented their creative social justice projects to their classmates. She remembers some of the boys, many of them athletes, speaking as powerful allies of LGBTQ people in the presence of all of their classmates. That memory will stay with her, she says, because it stands in contrast with her earlier observations of the book club groups.  Kayson says it is important to have empathy and understand something from someone else’s perspective and adds that Billy Bean lived two lives because in sports [being gay] could affect his career. Jordan says that “love is love—anyone can experience it.”  My colleague Mateo witnesses Berto come full circle during a discussion in which they talk about their own backgrounds and family history. Mateo says:      Knowing [Berto’s] background, knowing what’s going on socially and politically around immigrants, we just had this free-flowing conversation about social issues. I was able to open up with who I am, and my family’s background. And he just loosened up… And then I tied in the struggle of the LGBTQ community and he literally tilted his head and said, ‘Man, putting it that way…’ Like, I still remember it, he said, ‘Well if you put it that way, that makes sense.’ Having the conversation of the similarities in regards to how particular groups in American society have been oppressed based on their identity… because of someone’s identity, you know, not everyone has the same access to opportunity...  Empathy as a Condemnation and a Calling Out of Oppression and Inequity      [In Two Boys Kissing] Tariq, Craig and Harry’s friend, is a gay black male in the LGBTQ community. One day Tariq was physically assaulted by a group of boys because he was gay making it a hate crime. Levithan creates Tariq and introduces the readers to his conflicts to help create awareness of intersectionality and its role in society. (Emilia)  On the first day of the new unit, I observe Jordan say it is important to “get out of our bubbles” and learn LGBTQ topics and themes. Emerson wrote a response to Berto’s (problematic) journal entry, from the point of view of Sean—a homophobic character in From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun, by condemning the homophobia and stating the importance of   98  support for Melanin’s mom when she comes out. Emerson later writes in his review of the two novels he read:      From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun and Boyfriends With Girlfriends are important to read in school...both books talk about relevant social issues and ideas that occur in kids and adults lives, and we need to discuss them so the ones that are confused won’t be scared to come forward for help and for the people that are making these people feel the way that they do feel understand what these people are going through.   Rosaline offers to support me in any ways that I need when I tell her that I must return a call to Vicente’s mom, who responds to a text from me stating that Vicente is not keeping up with his book club schedule and assignments with an objection to queer content and a request for a phone call. During the film Vito, a documentary about Vito Russo, students in class 1 are surprised to learn that AIDS was first presumed to impact only gay men so as a result no government response or urgency for treatment or medical research for cures.  During the accountable talk discussion, Hazel says people judge because of society’s unwritten rules, and there is an injustice not only based on LGBTQ but also race. Sofia adds that things are especially difficult for LGBT women of color. Danielle, in class 2, states that oppression continues for African Americans and Puerto Ricans, and in the LGBTQ community everyone is still oppressed. “More light needs to be shed on this and more awareness,” she asserts and adds, “If we start to go against heteronormativity things could change in society because people will understand it’s wrong.”  Modes of Empathy: Expressing Emotion, Stating Outrage, and Using Storytelling        We Are Okay allows people to understand the importance of empathy, love, and friendship. Empathizing with another can heal wounds. Love can bring a person back from a dark place. Friendship has the ability to show a person how much they matter and how much their voice matters. (Maia)   99  Eruptions of love, emotion, passionate outrage about oppression, or relating to content by sharing a personal narrative are not the typical modes of expression one thinks of when it comes to a high school English class. But here the data suggests that queer literature and LGBTQ content teaches readers to have empathy utilizing modes of expression that do not seem related to classroom learning, but are exactly what is needed to make curricula relevant to youth and the disruption of oppressive systems in place to maintain the current social order that has people of color, children with learning disabilities, children from low income households, and those for whom English is their second language at a disadvantage.  At various points during the teaching of this unit, and in discussions about this dissertation with my colleagues and advisor, I felt tears well up in my eyes. I embrace a pedagogy of love, which is not without its moments of pain, doubt, and self-consciousness. But the data revealed participants engaging in several modes of empathizing with the characters and people featured in the content including emotions expressed in dialogue or writing, outrage at injustices and violence perpetrated on people perceived to be the other, and storytelling as a method of relating to characters or themes. At the end of the first day of the unit, Sofia hands in an exit slip, writing she is a bisexual teenager and proud of it. She adds how excited she is to learn about LGBT themes and book clubs. I read her slip aloud to a small group of colleagues during our collaborative planning period and get choked up and emotional as I read. Later when I interview Rosaline, she too reveals moments when she became emotional and I remember when she visits my classroom during a short video PSA, “Love Has No Labels.” The video captures an audience’s reactions to people who are at first behind a screen as they kiss, hug, or hold hands, so that only X-rays of their skeletons show, and then when they emerge, they are not who the audience, or viewer,   100  expects. Some are biracial, same-sex couples, some have their beautiful children with them; friends of different religions and abilities holding hands and showing their love and respect for one another. During the video, Roseline and I make eye contact several times and both fight tears. It is a beautiful piece that centers the power of love, diversity, and inclusion.  In my teaching memo, I write about another powerful moment that takes me by surprise—when Jordan says he might cry and asks to leave the room at the conclusion of the Vito Russo documentary when it is revealed that it is too late for him to receive life-saving medications and he succumbs to his illness, dying of AIDS.  Maia writes:      Cooper’s story in [Two Boys Kissing] hit me the most. Having my own sister come  out as lesbian, and seeing how my family learned to understand and fight against homophobia brings Cooper’s story close to my heart. Seeing how he feels unloved by his own family and friends is heartbreaking and brought me close to tears.  During the accountable talk discussion, I observe Jordan emphatically pronounce, “Give trans people rights! There shouldn’t be stigma [about bathrooms]. Why is it your place to deny someone rights? They just want to pee.”  Margarita responds to a quote she selects from Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, about Ari’s desire not to “sound Mexican.” She writes: “[this] shows another stereotype in society and how it’s affecting Ari because his main concern is about not sounding like a ‘Mexican’ but sounding ‘American.’ But I question, what does a Mexican sound like?”  Andrew writes that reading Two Boys Kissing has opened his eyes in profound ways. First, he selects a quote from the part of the book when Cooper’s father screams at him using profanity when he tries to come out.      This [quote] made me notice a lot that I wasn’t really thinking of before. There are gay kids out there with parents who neglect or disown them for being gay. That’s really upsetting to me since this is just one fictional example of this. Think of the sheer amount   101  of people that had to deal with this. 10% of our population is gay, which might seem small, but that’s more than 70,000,000 people. Now imagine how many of those people experienced this, especially in the last hundred years when there was even more discrimination. How about more than 100? When it was literally ILLEGAL to be gay? That’s what’s upsetting about this.  In my teaching memos, I write about Olivia, who writes me a note one day during quiet reading time. In her note, she writes that she had an argument with her mom the night before and is upset. I ask her if she wants to talk in the hallway and she does. Olivia shares how she feels stuck between her mom and dad, who are no longer together and are at odds. I tell her I relate and had a very similar experience with my parents at her age. Olivia has been a full (and at times an enthusiastic) participant in my class, but I find her sharing more of her personal life during this unit than she ever had before. When she reads Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, she writes about her own father, whose response to difficulty is to emotionally shut down as Ari’s father does. Her response follows the quote from the novel: “Sometimes I think my father has all these scars on his heart” (Saenz, 2014, p. 14).  Olivia: Every time I’m around my dad I see that he’s in pain.... My dad is the kind of guy who hides his feelings. Since his mom passed in 2015 he had no one to talk to. You can tell that he is hurting. You can ask him about it. Everything. But, never will you ever hear him pour his feelings out and explain how he feels.... I feel like my dad has all these scars but internally. So I felt a little connection to this quote.  Later, during the accountable talk discussion, Olivia tells of her brother who she says is homophobic and that he questioned her and called her nasty when she came out. She adds that he said, “You’re my sister and you can’t stop yourself,” and added that coming out can be a struggle for some people to accept. Her cousin is gay and coming out was very hard for him. As a makeup artist, the family was already very judgmental of his career choice. Abigail adds that her family is “judgmental” also. She shared that her cousin was homophobic and called her other cousin gay because he liked to watch the show That’s So Raven. Abigail says his mom did not   102  intervene, saying he should not watch the show. She adds, “He’s doing good now but when he was younger, they treated him like shit.” During the accountable talk discussion in class 2, Sebastian, who rarely speaks in class, tells of coming out as trans and how his friends help him overcome by engaging with a kid who used to bother him. As a result, this other kid changes his mind and Sebastian says he “felt empathy for me.” Sebastian did not offer any details as to how this happened but felt comfortable sharing it during the discussion. Jordan, who reveals that his sister is bi, says his parents are like whatever. He thinks as people get older, they are more accepting. Empathy and Queer-Inclusive (YA) Literature: Excerpts From Students’ Artifacts   Boyfriends With Girlfriends Antonio: This book is teaching me how other people try to not be themselves because of other [mean] people which is crazy.  Emerson: People today question their sexuality. They are scared because people start to oppress them in many ways.  The House You Pass on the Way Antonio: Not everyone is the same race and [Staggerlee] feels left out because she thinks she is different from everybody else…she lives in a all black neighborhood and has a white mom.   Hazel: Staggerlee feels very alone right now… she is half black and half white so she feels like she belongs no where. She is maybe gay and black so in this world she is very low.  Cameron: Hazel feels as if she’ll probably be made fun of in front of her friends, as if they’ll name call her and Staggerlee. Also I wonder how they feel upon each other? Like how they cannot show feelings to each other.  None of the Above Maria: Vee shouldn’t have laughed [at Kristin telling her she is intersex] because it is disrespectful… All of [Sam’s] friends were bullying Kristin and calling her Kristopher and trans, or even faggot. These are all very offensive things to say because it hurts people inside and out. What Sam says hurts Kristin even more because he used to be her boyfriend. Saying “man-whore” would hurt someone to a large extent.    103  Isidora: Krissy must feel upset since that was her boyfriend but now he’s just an acquaintance or nothing. Not being accepted is tough.  Vicente: It was obviously a dark time in their lives. The daughter at a tender age and the dad, married and having to face his wife dying.  Alex: It takes a lot of courage to have surgery right after you’re diagnosed with intersex. Will things be alright afterwards? Will anything change for [Kristin]? Is it the right choice?  “I knew I needed to tell Sam. I vowed to myself that I would, soon, when I knew how” (Gregorio, 2015 p. 64). Sebastian: Will she ever tell him? When will she know how? This part makes me feel excited and scared for what’s going to happen next because I want to know if she tells him and his reaction. [This was the only piece of writing that Sebastian turned in during the unit.]  Danielle: Nobody has control of how they are born and it shouldn’t reflect on them badly. Not everyone is born the same and that’s ok. People just have to come to terms with that.  Diego: I hope Vee is loyal and doesn’t tell anyone because Kristin doesn’t want people knowing… It’s crazy how much Kristin is willing to go through just to be comfortable in her own body...Kristin shouldn’t have to suffer through this just because of people being mean.  Josiah: If I was in [Kristin’s] situation I would’ve just kept my secret to myself until I got rid of it and then I would act like I never had it, but for some people it’s different and their feelings are different.  Bernardo: ...she is still a girl. [Sam] let her being intersex [make her] question her womanhood.  If I Was Your Girl Sofia: Amanda has been through so much. She finally has the chance to celebrate her birthday and just be herself. If you think about it, Amanda never really had time to be herself and be happy. She never had time to really be a girl. But now that her birthday is here, this is her day to be beautiful and feel amazing. She gets to have fun and basically just live life.  Aliyah: Amanda for most of her life has suffered with fitting in and being herself.   Danielle: When a child is going through something difficult they want their parents and its’ really difficult when they don’t have them.      104  Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe Josiah: Ari never really had friends. He disliked a lot of people in life, and I could tell that his temper got him to lose friends and he would be on his own most of the time. Until Dante came in his life and Dante is a really big person and plays a big part in Ari’s life.  Two Boys Kissing Maia: In everyone’s life telling your parents something that society deems unacceptable is a hard thing to do.... The book’s [characters] expressing hatred toward gay anything is so hurtful and horrifying to read.  Emilia: Breaking stereotypes opens societies eyes and allows us to be happy...In the book, Craig and Harry are doing something that makes them happy but are constantly receiving hate and being put down.  “Why must we die over and over again?” (Levithan, 2015, p. 189) Andrew: This quote was significant because it showed me who the chorus was: the LGBTQ community that has died already due to the homophobia from others. This amazed me: the entire book wasn’t just a story about trying to break a world record, but rather it was a message. It was a message about the homophobia in our community and the way they sent said message both surprised and amazed me.  In this section, it seemed most appropriate to have the students’ artifacts across the novels speak for themselves. It seemed significant that the students empathized so frequently with the characters in these novels, suggesting a deep interaction between student and text. The choice to focus on YAL exclusively for the book clubs facilitated meaningful interpretations and numerous opportunities for analysis. Moments of Discomfort: Resistance, Reifying Normative Discourses About Identity,  and Encountering Homophobia/Transphobia  This research is personal to me and the stakes are very high. I have many queer family members, friends, colleagues, and students. And I see through their experiences, second-hand, how it feels and what it means to be marginalized and even hated just for existing. So when I hear homophobia or transphobia in action, even when it is coming from a young person in my classroom or school building who likely does not understand the gravity of their actions or words, it is unsettling. It is even more profoundly unsettling when adults, especially those who   105  work in schools, most of whom have postsecondary educations, do not seem to understand or appreciate the urgency of queer inclusive curriculum and its potential to literally save children’s lives. (It is actually an instance of casual homophobia—a statement made by another doctoral student at Teachers College—that propelled me toward a research agenda focused on queer inclusive, culturally relevant pedagogy.)  When these moments of discomfort arise, I always want to shove that discomfort somewhere and keep on going, and then do the work later. But this has been a career-long endeavor. Now as a doctoral candidate, pursuing a university appointment in the next few years, queer-inclusive curricula and teaching LGBTQ topics and themes are pursuits to which I am fully committed. Creating the curriculum and selecting the texts at the center of this study, while it was a collaboration and I did not do so in a vacuum, were my brainchild. Of course, I wanted it to be perfect. It was not.  As I was doing the teaching and later analyzing the data I collected, there were moments where I felt like a failure, as if I did not do it right. How could it be that there were times I was “getting it wrong,” or perplexed by students’ resistance to queer content and unconsciously upholding the foundations of the very powerful gender binary—even though I had years of doctoral study and scholarly work at my fingertips, not to mention so much love in my heart? As a career educator with a passion for justice and a love of all children, I am an idealist with great hope that our youth hold great promise and can change our embattled country and make the world better than it currently is. Perhaps this is what sustains and enhances my teaching practice, but it has been difficult at times during this study to resist falling into despair about pedagogical missteps and assumptions I may have made—implicit biases about queer visibility that I did not consider, as a cisgender heterosexual partnered ally.    106  Again, as I analyzed the data (teaching memos, artifacts, and interview transcripts) to answer RQ1, moments of discomfort emerged as a theme, especially as it related to encountering pedagogical dilemmas and the accompanying inadequacies; participants’ resistance to queer content and the subsequent reifying of normative discourses about gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity, instances—while some were subtle—of implicit homophobia and/or transphobia.  “Getting It Wrong”—Pedagogical Oversights, Missed Opportunities, and Disappointments On the second day of teaching the unit, in my teaching memos I write about watching “the Power of a Single Conversation” in class 2, and how I worry about Alex. He makes a grunting noise of disapproval during the part of the film that discusses when California residents voted Yes on Proposition 8 in 2008, making it illegal for same-sex couples to marry. Bernardo and Jordan burst out laughing and ask to leave the room. They are likely laughing at the sound that Alex made and not the fact that he (who, since he transferred to Pearl Street at the beginning of the year, has been subverting gender norms, keeping very long, feminine fingernails that are filed, shaped, and even in length) was vocally condemning the actions of California voters in 2008. But I am protective just the same. However, Bernardo and Jordan seem to know how their laughter appears, and I perceive that they ask to step out so they do not disrupt class or make Alex feel embarrassed or disrespected, but I do not follow up. They return to class and are respectful and composed. I do not follow up with them after class to find out why they were laughing and felt it necessary to leave the room. I do not check in with Alex to see how he is doing, or even if he noticed that Bernardo and Jordan’s laughter began immediately following his groan of displeasure in response to the passage of Prop 8. I make the choice to not draw attention to any of it so that Alex will not feel seen or visible, but in all honesty, I also do not   107  want to make a mistake so I do nothing. I still do not know if that was the right thing to do. I want to believe that Alex felt comfortable and moved to share his vocal displeasure aloud in the first place and that he felt he could without any repercussions.  However, on the eighth day of the unit and day one in the second book club book, Alex does not speak to his group or to me. I am concerned. But I give him space and ask his book club to do the same. When Alex’s silence continues the next day, and it is accompanied by tears, I ask him privately if he wants to sit in the library or my colleague Rosaline’s office. He says he does, and clinging to his copy of If I Was Your Girl, leaves the room. He never tells me what happens, but when Aaron and Aliyah pressure Alex to speak, I tell them to stop. And once he leaves the room, I speak with Aliyah and Aaron and tell them to respect Alex’s privacy and not discuss his tears with anyone. Aliyah has been very engaged in the unit and even though she is best friends with Sebastian, the only out transgender student in the ninth grade, I do not place them in the same book club group. I know I can count on Aliyah to step up and support Alex.  On day five, Cameron, Kayson, and Emerson—all athletes—are very focused and engaged during “the origins of the high five and its inventor—an unsung gay pioneer” video and discussion about MLB player Glenn Burke of the LA Dodgers, who is traded to the Oakland A’s in 1977 because of his sexuality. But I am deeply troubled minutes later when Cameron makes a gesture, putting his hand near his mouth and moving it to simulate fellatio, toward Emerson, who is sitting with another group across the room. I quickly look away, and Cameron stops as soon as he sees that I notice. I do not acknowledge that I saw them because do not know what to say. I later discuss the incident, and my discomfort, with Verdell,16 an administrator who is very close with Cameron and Emerson—as mentor and loving, inspiring adult.                                                  16 Pseudonym.   108  The next day, Cameron and Emerson very politely ask me to speak with them privately. We go into the hallway. They are in ninth grade, but they tower over me. Cameron and Emerson take turns and explain that I misinterpreted the lewd gesture that I saw in class the day before, but they apologize for making me uncomfortable and say they will be more serious going forward. I am struck by their maturity and sincerity, but I am not surprised. When I spoke with Verdell about the incident, he assured me that he would have a discussion with the boys and follow up. The boys worship Verdell. He is a school leader, a counselor, their coach. Verdell is an incredible mentor, and an extremely professional, thoughtful, and respectful supervisor. This makes it possible for me to feel comfortable talking to him about what happened in the classroom, even though it troubles me. I also know Verdell will not rush to punitive measures, which I do not want. I battle my own disappointment during the accountable talk discussion in class 2 when, despite Danielle and Jordan thoughtfully trying to call Alex into the conversation more than once, Alex does not speak. Since accountable talk discussions are an assessment that is routine in English class, and Alex has not refused to participate since the beginning of the school year when he perhaps did not realize they were a graded assessment, this is beyond disappointing—especially because he has been so engaged with the reading and analysis of all the course texts. I try not to take this personally because I have spent my career designing my classroom to be a safe, inclusive, queer-friendly space that promotes love and learning. I wonder what makes Sofia and Olivia and Sebastian feel safe and out and free to be who they are in my class and not Alex. But Alex’s journey is not about me, my classroom, or my pedagogical stance, yet this still makes me feel like I failed him somehow. Even though Alex has been very successful academically, here I am reminded of my interview with my colleague Anna when she says:   109       I can name at least four or five kids who dropped out of Pearl Street. We couldn’t support them through their life journey...their challenges were very much organized around their sexuality. We could not figure out a way to keep them...could not move them to a place where they were educated successfully. So that’s painful.  I am also disheartened by Jordan dropping a grim truth bomb into the mix when during the accountable talk discussion, he says that there is always going to be hate, never a time when everyone loves each other. Inez adds that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Kervens builds on this idea, saying there will always be “that certain group that disagrees.” No one mentions that LGBTQIA*+ people are not political matters of opinion to be contemplated, but human beings. Inez’s and Kervens’ problematic statements go unchallenged, and I do not bring this back to my colleagues as a moment to teach into and connect to anti-oppression social justice curriculum that challenges ideas that marginalize. I am silent about the ways this pushes me into uncomfortable terrain. How do I expand my pedagogical stance to allow for opinions that differ from my own, as long as they don’t disrespect anyone? Encountering Resistance and Questioning (the Relevance of) Queer Content In my teaching memos I write about Antonio, who is initially annoyed that he “keeps learning about this” referring to his experiences in middle school, now high school and in more than one class. On day three, the first day of the book club meetings and the first of two YA books are assigned, Antonio complains again, along with Cameron and Isidora. They come in for class, see a stack of Boyfriends With Girlfriends17 books at their table, and begin asking if they can read a different book, saying they do not want to read it. It would appear that they judged the book by its cover, as they do not inspect the book or read the back cover for a summary before issuing grumpy complaints.                                                 17 See Appendix E for the cover art.   110  In my memos, I write about one of our collaborative curriculum planning meetings, when my colleague Cassandra shares “very problematic responses” from some of her students in the other English class. She says they do not want to learn about LGBT people and “they keep learning about this and don’t know why they have to.”  During our interview, my colleague Anna mentions that she believes a significant portion of the teaching staff at Pearl Street is very uncomfortable with nonbinary “anything” and as a result, “they reinforce lots of the binary and gender norm behaviors.” This complicates (a minority of) students in the study reporting/complaining that they always learn about LGBTQ people. It also contradicts other participants stating that Pearl Street is a queer-friendly school. Bernardo sees copies of Two Boys Kissing at his table, his second book club assigned text, and he makes a face at Josiah. It is clear to me that he is unhappy so I ask him about it. He says that he did not make a face, but has read the book already, in middle school. I decide to change his group so he will be reading None of the Above with Josiah, Diego, and Kervens. Even though I did see him make a face, and I do not think he made it because he already read the book, changing his group actually works out very well, and he enjoys being in a group with his friend Josiah and reading None of the Above. Explicit Resistance to Queer Content in the Form of a Religious Objection In my teaching memos, I write about Berto who is prepared, engaged, and focused on From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun with the rest of his book club—Emerson, Jose, and Bruno. He poses a thoughtful question to the group about how same-sex desire occurs. But when he adds that the Bible teaches that it is a sin, I find that I cannot hold my opinion to myself and sit with the group to ask if that sounds right to them. I regret this later, perhaps because I feel like I was sharing too much of my own views—and self—with Berto. I am unaccustomed to   111  discussing religious views and cannot seem to leave my liberation theology-based, “love everybody” viewpoint out of this interaction with Berto and his group, and I jump into the discussion. In class the next day, Berto is not prepared with the assigned reading or written response. I interpret his disengagement as being related to my viewpoint about the bible in opposition to his. During the first scheduled book club meeting for book two, Vicente is only on page 7 of None of the Above and says “maybe” he will do his homework when my student teacher, Odessa, asks him about it. After speaking to his advisor about it, she agrees that I should send his mom a text message to let her know that he has not been completing his reading homework. Her response to me comes at 9:30 p.m.: “What if a child is not comfortable with reading this type of material? I have questions and my concerns.”  The next day I speak to Rosaline and Mason (principal) before school to tell them about Vicente’s mom’s response to my text, and so they know I will be calling her later in the day. Despite his mother’s questions and concerns, Vicente is prepared for class with his assigned reading done, his written response, and engages in thoughtful discussion with his book club. Mason and Rosaline pop into my class for an informal observation and I ponder whether it is because of what I share with them about Vicente’s mom. After dismissal, I call Vicente’s mom. I am nervous, but it easier than I anticipated. She asks me about the book None of the Above. I tell her it is about a character who struggles to find acceptance after she is diagnosed with AIS, a type of intersex. Vicente’s mom says she does not know what intersex is and has never heard about it. She asks what do I do when a child is uncomfortable reading a “book like that” and that “we are a Christian family.” She adds that Vicente was very uncomfortable reading Aristotle and Dante. I say very kindly that I do not know what “book like that” means, but she does not   112  explain it to me. I say that the English department chooses books that help us discuss and dismantle various forms of oppression, and that is part of the mission of the school. I tell her she can reach out to me anytime with further questions and she thanks me for calling her. She does not say that her child is not allowed to read None of the Above and she does not contact me again. Reinforcing Problematic Narratives About (Queer) Identity I worry that None of the Above will perpetuate harmful narratives about intersex people when I realize that most of my students were not aware of the existence of intersex identities. The author’s decision to use the word “hermaphrodite,” which Gregorio discusses in the afterward of her novel, and a choice I don’t view as problematic until I realize my students come to this text without the same background knowledge that I have and will not be critically analyzed by the book club.  “Miss Lattimer, I think you might be what some people call a hermaphrodite.” (Gregorio, 2015, p. 38) Vicente: Maybe if [Kristin] told [Sam] earlier, the less problems there would be.... This condition is so rare so when she found out she had this, it made a hole in her life.  Aaron: This quote shows how intersexs are unaccepted in today’s society because it hasn’t had enough exposure yet. People that haven’t gone through this situation can’t relate to it so they won’t be able to accept it.  Josiah: It came to me as a shock that this person has a vagina and balls, and I’ve literally never heard anything like that before... This is a big problem and I believe [Kristin] thinks this because of what happened with her boyfriend that she hates living with testicles.  Bernardo: I think Kristin should have told [Sam] her secret…Kristin realized that it was sort of a privilege that boys thought she was sexy. Often girls think that it’s disrespectful, which some boys can make it disrespectful, but boys sometimes just want to compliment a girl. She sees how it feels when girls are seen as ugly by boys, and now she doesn’t like it…. If I was in Sam’s position, I’d be mad. I’m not going to lie. There aren’t many people out there who are willing to block out all the haters and accept people for who they are.    113  Later when Alessandra asks in class if intersex means a hermaphrodite, I fumble the answer when I say the term is not really used anymore because there are so many ways to be intersex, and people do not like the term. Before I know it, I have said penis and vagina and marvel at, despite all of my planning and preparation, feeling grossly insecure about my off-the-cuff discussion of what intersex means. On Harvey Milk Day, which is 13 days into the unit, Antonio insists that there are two genders. He is not reading None of the Above, and he is not familiar with intersex. Again in my attempt to explain what it is, I realize that I am perhaps reifying troubling narratives and inadvertently conflating gender and sex and while realizing it is a mistake to not have one of the full class texts or films teach about intersex people. What follows are further examples of problematic written responses to None of the Above, followed by examples from the some of the other novels: None of the Above “Was I still my dad’s daughter, or should he start calling me his son?” (Gregorio, 2015,  p. 42) Maria: Kristin is confused and doesn’t know what to do because she is technically a boy but she is also a girl.  “I’ve got nothing to say to you, you homo.” (Gregorio, 2015, p. 113) Sofia: If this were to happen in my high school, this type of language would be used. This whole situation/scenario would go down. Gregorio does a fantastic job conveying the facts that students can be very harmful to others when news goes around the school.  If I Was Your Girl Aaron: This must go on throughout a lot of transgender people’s life-always debating whether or not to tell their significant other or soon-to-be significant other of their flawed upon past as not many people would accept transgender people.  Alex: Either queer or straight, [If I Was Your Girl] makes us see that it is hard to really accept people who are different.  Danielle: Someone choosing to be different should be treated the same.  I’ll Give You the Sun   114  “My turn. My turn. My turn. I want to put my hands on your chest.” (Nelson, 2015,  p. 106) Bernardo: Noah is slowly coming out. This [quote] was significant to me because people in this society, day, and age don’t really come out as often like this. Some people remain trapped in their little holes for a long amount of time… Noah is very sensitive and feminine and is more of the indoor artistic type of guy. Jude is more adventurous and outgoing. She has more “masculine qualities” than Noah.  We Are Okay Inez: It is clear something happened between [Marin and Mabel] that caused confusion for both of them.... My prediction is that there was a connection between the two girls that was more than friends. But it wasn’t accepted or normal in their community causing the awkwardness between them…. I definitely think Marin’s reason for leaving was deeper than just her grandfather dying but also a conflict that made things awkward between Marin and Mabel.  Boyfriends With Girlfriends “The mere idea of girl sex made Lance feel a little woozy. Not that he had anything against heterosexuals.” (Sanchez, 2012, p. 61) Emerson: [misreads heterosexuals as homosexuals] This connects to our society today because this is how people think of some of them.  Berto: Lance doesn’t get why people that are bi date a gay. But Sergio knows that as a bi it’s easier to identify because they don’t have to be treated differently.  Encountering homophobia, transphobia. During our curriculum planning meeting, Cassandra reports that a few of her students say they do not want everyone trying to change their minds, and she worries her classroom will be unsafe for LGBT students. Rosaline discusses the importance of the classroom community, and the rituals and routines in place to make our classes positive, loving spaces for kids that we all work to build from day one, and the procedures for removing a student who is disrespecting peers or disrupting the learning environment. While my student teacher, Odessa,18 is teaching a lesson we planned together, it takes a turn that I do not anticipate. The lesson asks that students write a letter or diary entry from the point of view of a favorite character from their book club novel. Berto chooses to write his diary entry from the point of view of Sean, a homophobic character (who has a physical altercation                                                 18 Pseudonym.   115  with and then abandons Melanin Sun when it is revealed that his mother is a lesbian and dating a White woman in From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun). Berto adopts Sean’s problematic use of the word “dyke” in his entry, in reference to Melanin’s mother. Odessa and I are thrown off by this, and when I later review the assignment, even though it asks students to consider how characters have encountered heteronormativity, intersectionality, empathy, and disrupting dominant narratives, it does not explicitly require it. We are troubled because the assignment asks students to choose a favorite character, but we do not consider that we need to provide some guidance as to how to navigate, or even exclude, taking on the perspective of homophobic or transphobic characters in the given context of this assignment. Queer empowerment and positioning the students as allies were our pedagogical aim, but in doing so we seemed to neglect how to prepare for instances of hate that arise in some of the texts. Berto was the only student to interpret the assignment in this way, and while it is possible that he chose Sean, not as a favorite, but as a character whose feelings he wanted to explore, his choice is unclear. During an activity we do on intermittent Fridays called “pop-up popcorn” during which students share a compelling or evocative line from the book they are reading, Kenneth reads a line from None of the Above that contains hate speech. I wince when he reads it, and again feel like this is a pedagogical dilemma for which I am unprepared. During the Vito Russo documentary, Bernardo and Josiah put their heads down, and Bernardo turns away when there are scenes set in the historic Castro neighborhood of San Francisco in the 1970s. Imagery that contains men, in their muscled and shirtless glory—smiling and joyful, some of them holding hands and some of them kissing—disrupts the heteronormative school space and Bernardo turns his head toward the back of the room, his body language saying “I refuse to engage.” But perhaps it can be interpreted as “I am so uncomfortable because this   116  shatters everything I think I know about masculinity and what it means to be a man.” And “We are in English class, so why are we doing this?” During the accountable talk discussion, Berto references “The Power of a Single Conversation,”19 suggesting that the man who seems to have a breakthrough when an activist who reveals that she is gay and wants the same rights that he enjoys was just being polite. He says, “Some people have conversations to not be rude...maybe he stuck to the different perspective he still has.” Berto writes a similar statement in his book review: Berto: When I began reading Boyfriends With Girlfriends by Alex Sanchez I thought that I wasn’t going to finish it because just because of the topic it showed. Which was an LGBTQ topic. I’m all against it still after reading this book, but it was an interesting book.  During the accountable talk discussion, Aaron says there are certain places that do not accept it [LGBT identity?] and see it as bad. He adds, “My great-grandparents were disgusted when my cousin came out as gay.” What Happened When Ninth-grade Students Engaged in a Study of YA Queer Literature?  There were uncomfortable, disappointing moments of resistance that were joined by moments of powerful discourse, questions, and support for queer people. When the ninth-grade students at Pearl Street Collaborative High School engaged in a study of YA queer literature that included reading a variety of video and nonfiction text about LGBTQ people, history, and challenging powerful gender norms, students were able to have student-led discussions about multiple texts and draw connections to big ideas about society, the world they inhabit, and themselves. They were able to talk across texts, including YA fiction, media, and nonfiction. These young people were seamlessly and independently moving from speaking about a text, connecting to their own experience, and back to the text to discuss and pose their own questions.                                                 19 See Table 4 in Chapter III for a description of the media.   117  Some of the students’ writing and commentary demonstrated empathy for the characters and for the queer people they learned about, through reading a variety of text and media. Some were able to pose theories, share views, discuss sophisticated ideas such as intersectionality and heteronormativity, and critique various forms of oppression through reading, writing, and discussion. The data captured students’ voices, many of which engaged in thoughtful, student-centered dialogue about race, gender, and sexuality. Some students shared personal details about their identities, their families and loved ones, during discussions and written responses to literature and text. This level of discourse among young people, in their first year of high school, seems profoundly important. I am reminded of Gloria Ladson-Billings’ foundational work with cultural relevance and culturally responsive education (CRE), and how it leads to high achievement and deeper literacy work. Part II  How do students read, interpret, and analyze diverse sexualities and genders?  ● How do students resist and/or subscribe to dominant narratives about people of diverse sexualities and genders? Across the data I analyzed to examine RQ2 (student artifacts20 and teaching memos/ observations), which looks at the ways in which students are taking up analytical and interpretive practices and their perceptions of queer-inclusive course content,21 the following themes emerged as I was noting patterns and disruptions of patterns: Normative and problematic constructions of sexuality and/or gender; LGBTQIA*+ identity as emergent (incomplete), secret                                                 20 Again, see Table 5 in Chapter III for the number of artifacts collected from each of the 44 students. See Table 7 for descriptions of the characters in each of the YA novels to which the students wrote responses. 21 See Table 4 in Chapter III for an annotated list of all text and media assigned during the Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Clubs unit.   118  self; and Critical queer literacy: critiquing oppression and affirming the empowerment, visibility, and multidimensional identity of diverse sexualities and genders. A description of these themes and their attendant codes follows. Normative and Problematic Constructions of Sexuality and/or Gender My preliminary examination and analysis of the data (student artifacts and the teaching memos and observations) through the lens of RQ2, which sought to understand how the students are reading, interpreting, and analyzing diverse sexualities and genders, and whether they resist or subscribe to dominant narratives about queer and gender expansive people, revealed numerous examples of students holding normative, problematic constructions of sexuality and gender both in their writing and classroom discourse. In an attempt to name the interpretive practices and knowledge gaps the students were demonstrating, I reexamined the data and the following codes emerged. What follows is a description of the themes that I identified and the data that support each one. Heteronormative Constructions of Sexuality In a written response to Boyfriends With Girlfriends, Cameron writes that “Allie was straight until she met Kimiko,” suggesting that Allie’s sexuality is either straight or not straight-missing the nuance of bisexuality. Cameron is not the only student to write about Allie and render her desire for Kimiko and her bisexuality as invisible. In her book review, Isidora writes that the book “is about a group of students who are straight at first, but later in the book, they realize they are actually people who fall into the LGBT category.”  Sergio, another character in the novel, is an out bisexual teenager. There is tension between him and Lance, an out gay character because Lance is anxious about dating someone who is bi, in particular, because Sergio has never had a boyfriend (his previous relationship is   119  with a girl) and he does not want to be “exclusive.” Some of the students misread Lance’s insecurities as doubts about Sergio’s bisexuality. Hazel writes, “Maybe Sergio is actually bi,” in response to a passage that details Lance’s observations of Sergio at the mall with a girl. Sergio never questions his sexuality in the novel, but Hazel does after she is “shocked” that he and Lance have a sexual encounter. She predicts “Lance will make Sergio come out as gay rather than bi” which can likely be interpreted that Hazel views bisexuality as a mask for homosexuality. Berto further asserts that “Sergio knows it’s easier to be bi because you won’t be treated differently,” suggesting that Sergio chooses bisexuality so that he is actually viewed by the world as heterosexual.  In Maia’s response to a quote from We Are Okay that features a flashback of Marin and Mabel kissing and exploring each other’s bodies on the beach, she writes:      What is Marin and Mabel’s relationship? This quote is very confusing because we learned that Mabel actually has a new boyfriend named Jake. This shows another side of Mabel that brings into question what is her sexuality?  It would seem that Maia cannot read Mabel as bisexual, or having a fluid sexuality, which would explain her confusion about her having a boyfriend and a past sexual encounter with Marin. It is also of note that she is focused solely on Mabel’s sexuality (“confusing”) and not Marin’s and perhaps indicative of a heterosexist read of the passage.  In Kervens’ first response to Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, he misreads Ari’s gender and uses she/her pronouns, which raises questions about how he was reading the beginning of the novel and whether he made a heterosexist assumption that Ari had to be female. Josiah writes three (out of four assigned) responses that omit any references to Ari and Dante’s growing attraction for each other, even though they are central to the novel and to understanding the source of Ari’s inner conflict primarily with himself and what his feelings for   120  Dante might suggest about his sexual orientation. Instead, Josiah writes about Ari’s anger and isolation. Diego only writes one response and he too focuses on Ari’s temper. Inez, Lucia, Alessandra omit any mention of Noah’s sexuality in their responses to I’ll Give You the Sun. After watching a short film about some activists that went door to door in California to find out why people voted for Prop 8 to ban same-sex marriage in 2008, “The Power of a Single Conversation,” Odessa, my student teacher, overhears Josiah say he does not believe it would be possible for Dave Fleischer to know he was gay when he was 6 years old, as Fleicher reveals in the film.  More Heteronormative Constructions of Sexuality: (Opinions on) “Choosing”  Queer Identity  Some of the students make references to queer identities as being equivalent to an idea that can be disagreed with, as one could a political ideology or viewpoint. This interpretive stance appeared in the students writing and discourse, and although infrequently, is worthy of further analysis. The suggestion that not everyone is going to accept people of diverse sexualities and genders because people are entitled to their own opinions is a deeply problematic but prevailing view—especially considering the lack of queer-inclusive curriculum studies in professional development and teacher preparation programs, which in part accounts for its absence from most secondary school curricula. In our first curriculum planning meeting during the teaching of this unit, my teaching colleague, Cassandra, reports that some of her students say they do not want to learn about LGBT people, and that “they keep learning about this and don’t know why they have to. There’s always a gay unit and everyone is trying to change our minds.” During the accountable talk discussion, Emerson says that coming out is problematic because “everyone has different opinions. There’s always going to be a group of people who...think it is   121  wrong, shouldn’t be gay or lesbian.” In class two, Inez shares a similar view, but asserts “Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.”  Hazel writes about Staggerlee, the protagonist of The House You Pass on the Way—a biracial youth who questions her sexuality as she develops a crush on and kisses her friend Hazel, that “there’s always going to be that group/person with different opinions.”  Berto writes of his views on queer content in his review of Boyfriends With Girlfriends when he writes “I thought I wasn’t going to finish [reading] it because of the topic—LGBTQ. I’m all against it still after reading this book, but it was interesting.” He is using his voice in his book review to express that he is “all against it still” in regard to LGBTQ themed literature and topics, even as he simultaneously acknowledges “it was interesting” to do so.  A few students also used the word “choice” in reference to sexuality and gender identity. Jose, in his review of Boyfriends With Girlfriends, writes, “The hope is that people who read this book are supportive of others and their life choices and to not discriminate them because of their sexual preference.” Here he is perhaps unintentionally othering people with diverse sexualities-describing their sexuality as a “life choice,” even as his response also demonstrates an attempt to be an ally. Similarly, Hazel writes that since the four main characters “struggle with their sexuality throughout the book, it keeps you reading because you want to know what they have chosen to live with.”  In her review of If I Was Your Girl, Danielle writes that the message is “someone choosing to be different should be treated the same” and Kayson writes that Amanda “being who she wants to is the right choice for her.” Alex writes that If I Was Your Girl and None of the Above are related because “Amanda chooses her gender on her own will and Kristin just already had it.” In Berto’s discussion about From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun with his book club, he   122  poses a question to his group about how someone could develop feelings for someone of the same sex adding “because the bible and God teach that it is a sin.” Heteronormative Assumptions About “the Closet” and Visibility For some of the students, reading about a fictional LGBTQIA*+ character experiencing internal conflict about any aspect of their sexuality or gender identity was met with a heterosexist impatience for, a lack of understanding about, or a resistance to empathizing with the complexities of visibility and the coming out process for a queer or gender variant people. Hazel posits that Staggerlee “shouldn’t care what people think of her.” In her book review, she writes, “You shouldn’t hide who you are, just be you.” Hazel echoes this idea later in the accountable talk discussion and Sofia, Kayson, and Antonio concur that people just need to be themselves no matter what, Olivia adding “People should be ok with who they are and not hide themselves because of other people.” Oliva, who shares her own coming out story during the discussion, does not acknowledge or charge a heteronormative society with changing in ways that support queer visibility, and places the responsibility on queer individuals.  Inez writes a faulty analysis of I’ll Give You the Sun’s Noah when she writes he “isn’t clear on his identity right away, so it remains a mystery.... He even tries to throw off the people around him by getting involved with girls.” From the first few pages in the novel, Noah is not struggling with clarity on his sexual orientation, but with what being gay will mean for him in a heteronormative world. He is bullied and harassed for being perceived as gay. Inez misses the nuance—that it is painful for Noah to internalize the homophobia around him even as he is undeniably attracted to Brian who is not ready to come out. She does not contemplate that Noah dates girls to stifle his feelings for Brian, whose future as an athlete hinges on him remaining in the closet.   123  But there are more complex examples of heteronormative views on visibility and disclosure when students write about and discuss Kristin and Amanda, protagonists of None of the Above and If I Was Your Girl. Diego writes, “[Kristin] should accept how she is and not worry about others’ opinions.” His intentions are to support Kristin here, but he demonstrates a lack of understanding about her experience learning that she is intersex by diminishing how she feels. Many students critique the amount of time Kristin “waited” to disclose her intersex diagnosis to her boyfriend Sam. Vicente writes, “Maybe if Kristin told [Sam] earlier the less problems there would be.” Maria lets Sam off the hook for how horribly he mistreats and rejects Kristin when she is outed to the whole school. Maria writes, “Sam is letting her talk and explain why she didn’t tell him…” The subtext in the novel is that Sam is enraged (transphobic) and his masculinity is threatened when he learns his girlfriend, with whom he recently has intercourse, has testicles where her ovaries would be if it were not for her intersex condition, androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). In Aaron’s response to a quote on Amanda contemplating whether or not to disclose her transgender identity to Grant, he uses Amanda’s prior name Andrew [some trans activists refer to this as their deadname] and writes “before turning into a woman she didn’t accept who she is…” Next, he writes, “...Amanda is always debating if she should tell her friends that she used to be a boy named Andrew or not.” This is a misread in the way Aaron imagines the conflict for Amanda. The novel does not touch on the trans community’s stance on deadnaming explicitly, and while Amanda is debating with herself about whether she will disclose her trans identity, she never considers revealing her former name to her new friends. Aaron writes:       This must go on through a lot of transgender people’s life always debating whether or not to tell their significant other of their frowned upon past as not many people would accept transgender people.    124  Bernardo seems to conflate same-sex desire and coming out in his reading of I’ll Give You the Sun during a moment when Noah thinks about placing his hand on Brian’s chest, and there is palpable sexual tension as they take turns looking through a telescope. He writes:       Noah is slowly coming out. This is significant because people in this society don’t really come out as often like this. Some people remain trapped in their little holes for long amounts of time.  Bernardo’s analysis equates Noah’s desire for Brian (including a misinterpretation that he acts on his feelings) as coming out. It would also seem that he finds Noah’s “coming out” as unusual and believes that Noah suppressing his feelings “for long amounts of time” is more the norm. Bernardo’s response indicates he is trying to unpack Noah’s sexuality and chooses a perfect instance of this in the text. But Bernardo does not seem to have the language to describe what is happening and seems to read it as very different than his own experience—perhaps because he is stifled by a sexually charged moment between two boys, which stands in contrast to his responses to instances of sexual tension and characters expressions of their (hetero)sexuality in None of the Above.  Acceptance of (Intergenerational) Heteronormativity There were several instances of student discourse and writing that reinforced heteronormativity is to be expected in society and that diverse sexualities and genders are not the norm. At times, students theorized this acceptance is firmly rooted in ideas that are passed down from one generation to the next. Many of the students that read None of the Above referred to powerful, accepted norms. Aaron writes:      Intersexs are unaccepted in today’s society. It hasn’t had enough exposure yet. People that haven’t gone through this situation can’t relate, so they won’t be able to accept it.  Kervens writes, “The realization of Kristin becoming a hermaphrodite will probably spark future conflict.” For Vicente, heteronormativity manifests as empathizing with Sam, who it   125  is later revealed defaces Kristin’s locker with transphobic hate speech after he learns she has testicles. He writes, “To date a girl, be in love, and find out she has male parts is hard and must be hard on his part [to decide] what to do.” Bernardo has a similar response. He writes:      We can’t really blame Sam for his decision. If I was in his position I’d be mad. I’m not going to lie, but I guess I choose to stick to the norm.  Bernardo adds that Darren’s choice to start dating Kristin is the exception because “there aren’t many people out there who are willing to block out all the haters and accept people for who they are.”  Berto writes, “[From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun] shows how one person solved a real-world problem, but not all the time are people going to accept it.” It is safe to assume the solved “real-world problem” he refers to is Melanin’s eventual acceptance of his mother and her relationship with Kristin, but that in the real world there are those who would not. During the accountable talk discussion, Berto says that change will take time, and it will “take a lot of videos to change [people’s] views.” He also suggests that the pivotal, resonant moment portrayed in the film short “The Power of a Single Conversation” between a young lesbian activist who talks to an outwardly homophobic man was an act—that it did not show he had a change of heart after hearing the young woman’s story, but that perhaps he was just having the conversation with her to not be rude.  During the accountable talk discussion, several students shared that they also believed that heteronormativity in society was not likely to change. Aaron says:      Barriers won’t ever be broken down because of how you were brought up. This is still an issue if you are different from others.  Jordan adds, “There is always going to be hate. Never going to be a time when everyone loves each other.”   126  Jose writes that the characters in Boyfriends With Girlfriends are considered “outcasts because they are LGBTQ,” even though there is no basis for such an analysis. In many respects, the novel could be considered homonormative, in terms of the author’s depiction of LGBT teenage characters’ visibility being embraced by their peers at school, so Jose’s interpretation reveals an expectation that characters will be marginalized by peers, which is not based on the text. Emerson seems to share a similar view, when he writes the theme is that “when you start to realize something about yourself you are scared to accept it because of what society thinks.” Antonio writes that “school can be a hard time for the people who don’t follow the gender norms...they will get bullied and they will feel like they don’t belong in this world.” Alma writes:      Books related to these world problems made me realize how scary it must be to express yourself due to the fact that people may not accept you. These things are frowned upon because people don’t accept others who are different.  At first Inez reads We Are Okay with an expectation that homophobia will be a central conflict. She writes:      My prediction is that there was a connection between the two girls that was more than friends. But it wasn’t accepted or normal in their community causing the awkwardness between them. Something definitely happened that had to pause their romantical feelings for each other like maybe their parents are homophobic, her grandfather. Either way, I definitely think her reason for leaving was deeper than just her grandfather dying but also a conflict that made things awkward between Merin and Mabel.  Normative Constructions of Gender None of the Above was read by 19 students,22 many of whom were not previously aware of the existence of intersex people, and much of the data revealed students holding problematic, cisnormative views that biological sex corresponds with gender—and that there are two genders. Sofia tells me before class how much she is enjoying the pacing of the novel, and that she’s glad she didn’t have to wait for her biggest question to be answered on page 10. “I thought she was                                                 22 See Table 6 for the groups of students who read the novels.   127  female, but she’s not!” Isidora writes that “[Kristin] is not a girl but also not a boy, she is in fact neither of them.” Isidora is not able to critique the text and instead parrots Kristin’s own misunderstandings about her intersex diagnosis and how it shakes her own ideas about being a girl. Vicente writes, “What [Kristin] has is 1 in 1500 births. But also society does not recognize this as a normal thing. They expect a woman to have female parts and a male to have male parts.” Aaron equates biological sex with gender and during a class discussion says that intersex is having two genders.  Maria writes, “Jessica is one person who doesn’t see Kristin as a man, unlike Sam and most of the kids at her school who bully her.” Maria is struggling to articulate the ways that Kristin’s intersex diagnosis is received by the students at her school. No one sees “Kristin as a man” but they use transphobic hate speech and imagery (i.e., cutting and pasting her face onto the image of a “pudgy figure with 80s clothes and the words, It’s Kris the hermaphrodite,”  p. 111) to bully her. When Kristin begins to spend time with her classmate Darren, Maria writes that Kristin “finally found someone who saw her as a girl and not a girl with boy parts.” The protagonist of this novel is forced to question her female identity as the revelation that she is chromosomally male and does not have female reproductive organs shakes her fundamental understandings of what it means to be a girl. Yet some students’ interpretations of Kristin lacked analysis of her internal struggles with perceptions of herself, which are prevalent in the text, and instead focused on her external conflicts with the other characters and the ways they sought to erase her. Alma writes, “No one is going to view Kristin in the same way.”  Josiah writes that for him, None of the Above “turned out to be an amazing and interesting story that has nothing to do with being LGBTQ,” which is a compelling analysis as he wrote much about the ways Kristin’s intersex anatomy challenged his ideas about biological sex   128  and its correlation to gender identity. Antonio seems to have the reverse analysis, when he says in class that he is annoyed to “keep learning about this,” and when I asked him what he meant he just said gender. In my teaching memos I write that Antonio has mentioned more than once that there were only two genders or that he didn’t know why the content was relevant. He seemed to be conflating gender and sexuality.  If I Was Your Girl centers on Amanda as an empowered transgirl, even after her trans identity is traumatically disclosed to her peers at school. The focus of the novel is not on her transition, though it is alluded to in flashbacks that reveal what led up to Amanda changing schools and moving in with her father. A source of conflict for Amanda is if and when to disclose her trans identity to Grant, her love interest, and not necessarily on coming to terms with her trans identity. Yet many students read with a heteronormative lens and wrote problematic analyses of Amanda, at times creating conflicts where they did not exist. Maria writes, “Amanda is a transgender female meaning she used to be a guy, Andrew and is now a girl, Amanda...even her boyfriend thought she was a girl.” Margarita writes, “Throughout the book, Amanda is wrestling with identity and sexuality.” Margarita is perhaps using sexuality to describe Amanda’s relationship with Grant, but she never wrestles with sexuality as far as her sexual orientation.  Antonio, whose book club is not assigned to read None of the Above or If I Was Your Girl, insists during a small group lesson that there are two genders. It is more than 14 days into a unit on disrupting dominant narratives about sexual orientation and gender, and even though discussions about gender identity have not been prevalent in the two YA novels he was assigned to read, there have been several full group readings and discussions about harmful norms in society that oppress everyone.   129  Heteronormative Us/Them Positioning One of the pedagogical goals of this unit was to destabilize current notions of sexuality and gender and use a variety of culturally relevant text and media in an effort to position students as queer allies. Yet some of the students’ discourse about diverse sexualities and genders created an us/them dichotomy that centered heteronormativity. Antonio, Isidora, Cameron, and Bernardo all had negative reactions (i.e., requests to switch novels or body language) to the cover art on their assigned YA novels that depicted provocative, photorealistic imagery23—four teens on their backs, looking longingly at each other or two White boys kissing.  Berto writes of Boyfriends With Girlfriends and From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun, “Both books talk about the LGBT and how they have problems too.” Josiah writes of None of the Above, “It was a shock that this person has a vagina and balls and I’ve literally never ever heard anything like that before. It’s strange to me but also interesting to see people that live like this.” Most of the students reported they had no prior knowledge that intersex people existed, but what is notable about this section of Josiah’s response is that he does not refer to Kristin by her name and instead uses “this person.” He continues (still not using her name), “Nothing matters but getting those balls out of her. She really didn’t like living with the problem. This is a big problem and I believe she thinks this because of what happened with her boyfriend that she hates living with the testicles.”  In Bernardo’s review of I’ll Give You the Sun and None of the Above, he writes:      Often times, children like me are not exposed to these different kinds of people or different experiences.... It is societies fault for not having many opportunities to learn about these kinds of people.                                                   23 See Appendix E for Boyfriends With Girlfriends and Two Boys Kissing cover art.   130  He goes on to laud the importance of reading such literature in schools, yet his view that “these different kinds of people,” even as he indicts society for queer exclusion, suggests that he views diverse sexualities and genders as the other. Danielle writes:      From studies, a lot of people who are in the LGBTQ community, a lot of them feel alone and like they are the only person like them. The reason they feel alone is because society makes these things about them wrong and frowned upon.  Even as Danielle positions herself as an ally, she mentions uncited research to make the generalization that a lot of LGBTQ people feel alone which is itself problematic—as it reinforces that queer people are marginalized by society and perpetuates a disempowered victim narrative.  Reified Constructions of Gender Roles: Performing Femininity and Masculinity Problematic ideas about gender, gender roles, and normative constructions of masculinity and femininity appeared in some of the students’ responses and in classroom discourse. Bernardo writes about Sam and Kristin’s first sexual encounter (Gregorio, 2015, p. 29), before she learns from a doctor that her painful experience with intercourse is due to her hypoplasic, or short vagina. Bernardo writes, “Her boyfriend Sam is very respectful and mature. He made sure that she wanted to have sex…” He elaborates:      Girls are pressured to have sex to not get their partners upset, even though they don’t want to. Sam repeatedly asked Kristin for consent which I find very respectable in a man.  Bernardo continues to candidly unpack his ideas about gender and gender performance when he selects a provocative quote that captures Kristin’s thoughts.  “To think that I was so ungrateful when boys thought I was sexy.” (Gregorio, 2015,  p. 174).  Bernardo: Some people usually stick to these norms. But Kristin realized that it was sort of a privilege that boys thought she was sexy. Often, girls think that it’s disrespectful which some boys can make it disrespectful, but boys sometimes just want to compliment a girl. She sees how it feels when girls are seen as ugly by boys, and now she doesn’t like it.    131  The notion that Kristin’s intersex identity makes her less desirable, or at least initially, and that she would miss being objectified by boys is interesting as it reinforces that girls are most valued as sexual objects and equates femininity with being desired by (masculine) males.  Aaron has similar notions of the ways the characters are performing gender when he writes the following:       Kristin is a very humble girl that doesn’t care about fame and glory. She only cares about her sports and her boyfriend, while she doesn’t expect much of herself. Faith is the complete opposite. She wants to be the most Glorious, Glamourous, Godly of a girl. She cares about being the homecoming queen and about being pretty. She wants to always be number one.   Both Aaron and Bernardo, though not in the same book club groups, have normative ideas about what it means to be a girl in their written responses to and reviews of None of the Above.  While reading I’ll Give You the Sun, about fraternal twins Jude and Noah, some students reified socially sanctioned expectations that girls perform femininity to attract masculine boys and boys perform masculinity to attract feminine girls, even as the author was working to subvert those norms. Bernardo writes:      Noah is very sensitive and feminine and is more of the indoor artistic type of guy. Jude is more adventurous and outgoing. She has more “masculine qualities” than Noah. Did I mention that Noah is also gay and falls in love with their next-door neighbor, adding more “umph” to his feminine qualities?  Jordan and Bernardo erupt in laughter when Alex makes a high-pitched noise of disapproval during “The Power of a Single Conversation” video—when David Fleischer, a gay activist, is discussing the disappointment of when Prop 8 (a proposition banning same-sex marriage) won in California in 2008. Jordan and Bernardo try to conceal their laughter by stepping out of the classroom. Through the lens of RQ2, I believe this occurrence is compelling because it appears that they are laughing at Alex’s reaction, not because they disagree with him, but perhaps because they find his high pitch humorous. I have never before noticed (and I have   132  looked for it) a reaction from students to Alex—who subverts gender norms with his very long filed and shaped fingernails.  Queer Identity as Disempowered, Tragic Victim of Bullying Jose writes:      Alex Sanchez understands how people with identity issues and members of the LGBTQ community feel and what they have to deal with like discrimination, threats and whatever else is to come.  Jose unwittingly equates being queer with having an identity issue and is suggestive of the author, an out gay man, knowing what it feels like to be marginalized and harassed. While that might be a thoughtful and not entirely flawed analysis, Jose’s rhetoric suggests that queer people are not fully empowered or agentic and are solely charged with navigating oppressive circumstances.  Similarly, when Kayson writes a response to Kristin’s intersex diagnosis being shared with the entire school, he (rightly) predicts, “She is now going to be bullied.”  When Kenneth writes, “Kristin experiences homophobia and disrespect because of her now knowing that she is intersex—this is problematic since it can cause lots of issues later in the story,” he does not analyze what is problematic about the marginalized status and what is homophobic about it. When he writes a response to Kristin finding “Stay away tranny faggot” (Gregorio, 2015, p. 127) spray painted on her locker, his focus is on how being bullied will impact her grades and status on the girls’ cross-country team—and he does not condemn or critique the vandalism. Vicente writes that “everything is falling apart for Kristin. How is she supposed to tell her boyfriend she has testicles?”     133  LGBTQIA*+ Identity as Emergent (Incomplete), Secret Self It was striking that many students, across the nine different novels, were describing characters’ experiences and identities using phrases like “true self,” “struggling to figure out who she is,” and “past self” when they were writing about characters with diverse sexual orientations and genders. It is unclear whether the students were equating diverse sexualities and genders with harboring a secret identity, yet this pattern was compelling. In most of the novels, this would be considered a faulty analysis—the characters are not questioning their sexuality and/or gender identity and the source of tension is stemming instead from the character’s relationships with other characters, an external conflict with a heteronormative society, or an internal conflict with whether or not to disclose a gender identity or sexuality that destabilizes heteronormativity. Across the artifacts and teaching memos, some of the students seemed to apply a heteronormative lens to a queer character’s experience of their own identity. Since the unit was framed with an anti-heteronormative, social justice, queer empowerment lens designed to position readers as queer allies, these types of responses are indicative of a lack of critical queer literacy (which I further explore and define in the next section) that my colleagues and I did not anticipate when we planned the curriculum and chose the novels. Next, I describe the codes to identify when the students were utilizing this interpretive stance. Diverse Gender Identity as Secret Self Students who read None of the Above, If I Was Your Girl, and Two Boys Kissing repeatedly referred to the respective protagonists’ (Kristin, Amanda, Avery) secret queer identity, sometimes even using quotation marks, thus avoiding a multidimensional description of their experiences as intersex, transgender teens. Some students used the word secret more than five times in a single response. Some of the students that read the other seven novels also   134  described diverse sexualities or genders as the keeping of a secret—with the suggestion that people have strong feelings (that sometimes bring about violence) when the secret identity is disclosed. The following excerpts are from students’ written responses. For the most part, students were not yet able to critique the idea that queer people have agency over whether or not to disclose their sexual orientation, gender identity, or biological sex, and that requiring someone to disclose, and imposing sanctions when they do not, is discriminatory and oppressive. None of the Above Alex writes that he doubts “Vee and Faith would betray Kristin’s secret.”  Diego: “I hope Vee is loyal and doesn’t tell anyone because Kristin doesn’t want people knowing.” Diego’s response serves to empower Kristin, by asserting his desire to have her privacy respected.  Josiah puts himself into Kristin’s shoes when he writes, “If I was in her situation I would’ve just kept my secret to myself until I got rid of it and then I would act like I never had it.”   Kervens: “[Kristin] has been wanting to hide this from her friends and family to try to not change their views on her...Kristin tried to explain why she kept it a secret from Sam.” Alex: “Kristin learns her secret is found out.” Alma: “All these accomplishments are ruined when [Kristin’s] secret is revealed to the school without her knowing.” Vicente avoids using “intersex” when he writes “[Kristin] will have to tell the track team her ‘secret.’” He adds, “When Sam finds out she was intersex, he made sure to stay away from her.” Maria also avoids using “intersex” and writes that “Sam is mad when he finds out and doesn’t want to see Kristin or be around her.”    135  Sebastian’s only written response during the unit has to do with whether Kristin will disclose her intersex diagnosis to Sam. He writes, “Will Kristin ever tell Sam? When will she know how? What will his reaction be?”  Laila writes that she feels bad about the ways that Kristin is bullied and disrespected and is relieved that “Kristin is now looking at the people who exposed her secret.”  Bernardo writes, “Kristin should’ve told Sam her secret.” He does not lay out his reasoning for feeling this way. If I Was Your Girl In a written response to a passage about Amanda and Grant, Kayson writes, “...makes me think about whether or not her ‘boyfriend’ knows her secret.”  Sofia: “[Amanda] goes to a new school with a big secret.” Margarita: “Amanda has a huge secret that she keeps to herself.” Aaron: “Throughout the story, Amanda lived in fear that someone in her new town would find out her secret and it would ruin her.” In his review, Aaron uses the word secret more than four times. He writes, “[Amanda’s] secret is she used to identify as a boy named Andrew.” None of his written artifacts use the word transgender in reference to Amanda. Laila: “...makes me think about if Grant is going to keep Amanda’s secret or not. Which I hope he does cause they’ll be cute together.” In another response, to when Amanda’s friend Bee comes out (p. 45)—as bisexual—and that she has a history with Amanda’s friend Chloe, Laila writes, “...how long is she planning on hiding her secret? Now that everybody is confessing their secrets will she?” In her review, she writes “[Amanda] moves in with her father...hoping nobody will find out her secret.” Alex: “Amanda trusted Bee enough that she told her, and only her, her secret.” Alma: “Amanda Hardy—an 18-year-old who held a major secret.”   136  Danielle writes:      Maybe because all of [Amanda’s] friends have secrets they’ll be understanding of hers. Or maybe because of her secret they may not want to be her friend anymore because they won’t understand her and her keeping a secret so big.  In her review of both novels, Danielle writes, “[Amanda] wonders if they would still be so welcoming if they knew her secret. Kristin tells her best friend and then…the entire school knows her secret.” Two Boys Kissing Alessandra writes:      Avery has just unleashed his biggest secret onto someone he barely knows yet feels connected to. Being transgender is a big part of who Avery is and he is scared Ryan will now see him as different.  Diverse Gender Identity as Emergent, Incomplete, or “Past” Self   Most of the students who read None of the Above and If I Was Your Girl seemed to interpret Kristin and Amanda as characters not yet possessing full autonomy or agency, as a result of their marginalized identities as intersex and transgender. Many YA novels are thematically tied to issues of self-discovery and coming of age, but it was a compelling pattern that most of the students who read the books were using such similar language to interpret and analyze these two characters. It was unintentional, but since the books were identified as being in the mid-range in terms of their reading level, many of the students read both of the novels, which provided interesting insight into students’ ideas about gender.  Kristin—None of the Above Maria writes that “Kristin is confused and doesn’t know what to do. She is running away from who she is but tries to accept it with Darren—and she does because of him.” Maria’s response positions Kristin as being incomplete, denying who she is until she is rescued by   137  Darren. In her review of the novel, she writes, “Kristin after she discovers her real self gets very marginalized. She is struggling with identity and finding out who she really is.” Aaron writes that “Kristin is trying to have a ‘normal life’ even after her newfound discoveries [about herself].” He puts quotations around normal life to suggest perhaps that normal is a problematic concept, but he also avoids discussion of her intersex diagnosis. Kayson empathizes with Kristin when he writes that her “...diagnosis potentially changes her whole life—her dad may look at her differently, friends may not want to hang out, things will get messy with her boyfriend.” This also implies that Kristin is not fully herself until she learns of her intersex identity and Kayson accurately predicts there will be unjustified consequences for her.  Laila also touches on Kristin’s changing sense of self when she writes, “Kristin is starting to feel like she isn’t who she was before [the diagnosis].”  Danielle writes:      Kristin is at a point where she is doubting a lot such as her friends, her femininity, who she is and more...this [book] was about her finding herself and I feel in the end she found herself by things not falling apart for her anymore.  Kervens writes, “Kristin comes to accept who she was, and to forgive Vee and Faith for revealing her secret.” Amanda—If I Was Your Girl Sofia writes that “She finally has the chance to celebrate her birthday and be herself. If you think about it, Amanda never really had time to be herself and be happy.” Sofia celebrates Amanda’s trans identity, describing her first birthday post-transition as Amanda being her true self.  Maria writes, “Amanda didn’t feel comfortable in her old skin and now in the new skin/perspective she is in now she feels better. She feels whole now, not like she is still missing something.”   138  Margarita writes in her review that the book, “...showed the identity issues [Amanda] had to struggle with and how society played a role in making that difficult for her to figure out.” Alex writes, “She’ll become stronger than her past self.” In his review of the novel, he writes the book, “...is about Amanda starting a new life, and leaving her other self behind her.” Diverse Sexuality as Secret Self  Even though in some of the novels the author uses the term “secret” somewhere on the dust cover, or even in the novel itself, many of the students used the term “secret” as a stand-in for “lesbian,” “gay” or “bisexual.” This seems to point to either a knowledge gap of queer specific vocabulary or possibly an (unconscious) avoidance of it.   In Berto’s review of From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun, he uses the word “secret” eight times in reference to his mother’s lesbian identity, writing “[Melanin] finds out a big secret about his mom.”  In my written observations of the accountable talk discussions, I noted some of the students referring to people with diverse sexualities as people in hiding. Hazel cited a text we read- about Billy Bean, a former MLB player who eventually came out after leaving the League, saying, “He was gay and didn’t want to wreck his marriage or kill his career. He was hiding.” Kervens also mentions the gay athletes we learned about, specifically how Glenn Burke and Billy Bean’s fans thought they were masculine. But Bean kept it a secret (that he was gay). Andrew says that Noah, one of the central characters in I’ll Give You the Sun, is gay but for a lot of the story, he has to hide it because he is made fun of, chased down, and called names. Sofia says there’s a common theme across all texts, there is a secret people are keeping from their parents. People are hiding their identity in baseball and in None of the Above, Kristin did not want to tell her boyfriend. People always have the secret.   139  Diverse Sexuality as Emergent, Incomplete Self  In nearly all of the novels, even those that focused on gender, there were characters with diverse sexualities. I found similar discourse patterns among the students that analyzed characters sexualities as indicative of a struggle with self even when none existed, although they were less frequent than they were in the novels that focused on gender identity.  In her review of Boyfriends With Girlfriends, Hazel writes, “...there are four main characters who are struggling to find their identity. The author created characters that did not know how to be themselves. Isidora: “I wish [the author Sanchez] would have spent more time writing how [Allie] felt when she found her true identity.” In Antonio’s response to a quote about Lance trying his best to “not act gay” (Sanchez, 2012, p. 28) he writes, “You can’t be your true self without people saying something.” In his review of the novel, he writes:      I don’t really like books on people struggling with finding how they sexually identify. Boyfriends With Girlfriends shows you about how you never know your true self until you discover new things. Main characters figuring out their identity through a series of dates and memories of their struggle.... Allie and Lance are close friends who are going through an identity crisis.  Jose also uses charged language in his writing about From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun, about EC, Melanin Sun’s mother, writing that she “is in a sexual identity crisis” which is a misreading, or indicative of Jose not knowing how to describe EC’s profound disappointment with her son’s reaction to meeting Kristin, the White woman she is in love with. She is not experiencing an internal struggle with her sexuality, as Jose’s choice of words would suggest.   140  Alexa writes in her review of The House You Pass on the Way that “[Staggerlee and Trout] each gain strength from each other to figure out who they really are. Staggerlee might’ve found another piece of her identity. She is still learning who she is.”  Vicente also writes that Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe: ...was about finding out who they really are…but it was hard for them to find out if they were gay or not…I kept reading over the pages but I couldn’t seem to figure out why [Ari] would feel like this.  Vicente adds that the title of the book  ...isn’t necessarily about the actually [sic] universe, but finding himself. He learns, he loses, he regrets. But that’s what life is, you learn from your mistakes, you sometimes lose, and you regret the choices you make. But no one is perfect and it’s what you do that makes [you] who you are.  In Olivia’s review of the same novel, she writes, “Saenz uses the characters Ari and Dante to show how young men were able to become their true selves over time.” In responses to I’ll Give You the Sun, Teagan writes:      Noah is brave enough to show his true self to his father.... This part shows that Brian’s first step is in accepting himself, and as he holds Noah’s hand out in the open, he is doing this...he is finally brave enough to be himself.  Inez: “[Noah] continues to hide his true self…‘the real’ Brian seems to be very similar to Noah.”  Lucia: “[Noah and Jude] try to stay afloat through their struggles to find themselves.” David writes:      [I’ll Give You the Sun] is about “discovering who they really are…. Noah says he doesn’t feel comfortable sharing his secret so he puts on a show for his family and sister.... The novel’s main characters deal with finding their true selves. Jude and Noah struggle with finding their real selves...each narrator struggles to be complete. Noah feels the need to hide his true self.  Alessandra writes:   141       [Noah and Jude] go through many stages in the process of attempting to hide who they really are afraid of how society would perceive them. They as well being afraid to accept who they are.  In responses to Two Boys Kissing, Benjamin writes:      Levithan is saying that, if gay people create a community and society, and a world of tolerance where gay people don’t have to live in fear, a world where they can express their identity.  David: “The book is about… wildly different characters who all struggle with who they really are and finding themselves.”   Emilia: “The chorus might be significant by helping the characters discover themselves.” In one of her responses to We Are Okay, Emilia writes, “[Marin] chose not to continue to discover herself because she feared not knowing who she is. She felt more comfortable creating an image for herself rather than discovering who she was.” “Queer Avoidant” Language  Another pattern that seemed worthy of analysis, though it was less frequent, was when students would use indirect, inarticulate language in reference to characters using phrases such as “like that” or “that way.” Although it is not entirely clear whether students were deliberately avoiding a term or whether again there was a gap in critical queer literacy stemming from a lack of knowledge or experience with queer and gender expansive literary characters and/or people. Implications for practice include, when teaching this unit again it seems important to include discussions and definitions of terms such as “disclose” and “come out” so that students who are less experienced with queer concepts can learn more. Emerson misreads a homonormative quote in Boyfriends With Girlfriends (Lance feeling woozy at the idea of heterosexual “girl sex”) as homophobic, writing that it shows “how people think about these things.” He uses the phrase “these things” twice in this response, indicating a   142  possible reluctance to articulate his thinking about a passage that contained a character’s attitude about sex.  Some of the students who read None of the Above avoided using the medical and scientific terminology that is used in the novel. Alma avoids using “intersex” when she writes, “Kristin is told what she is” at least twice in her written response to Kristin’s doctor revealing that she has AIS, an intersex condition. Laila writes that Kristin’s doctor tells her “she has both” instead of summarizing what her doctor tells her about her reproductive organs. In Josiah’s first responses he writes, “people that live like this” and “how it is to live like that” instead of writing specifically about Kristin and her diagnosis.  Some students avoid using terms such as transgender or gender affirmative surgery when they write about Amanda. Margarita writes, “She’s happy about what has happened [post-surgery]. It brought her to who and what she is right now.” Alma refers to Amanda’s transition as “the transformation—which reminds her that she is different which causes conflict. Amanda thought low of herself and felt she didn’t deserve any type of happiness due to how she is.”  Critical Queer Literacies: Critiquing Oppression and Affirming Empowerment,  Visibility, and Multidimensional Diverse Sexualities and Genders  About halfway through my initial analysis of the data for RQ2, I was struck by an emerging contrast in students’ literacy practices—those whose interpretations and analyses of queer content reified socially constructed, problematic ideas about sexuality and gender (as I described in the previous two sections), and those whose analytical frames demonstrated critical queer literacies that disrupted norms and served to humanize a diverse mosaic of sexualities and genders. To be clear, these themes did not appear as an either/or dichotomy. Some of the students were demonstrating what could be characterized as critical queer literacies that seem to be have been enhanced by their engagement with YA queer literature (related to the themes   143  empathy and queer visibility that emerged in my analysis of RQ1). For example, some of the passages that students selected and wrote responses to reveal an engagement with queer content that disrupted simplistic, unidimensional portrayals of LGBTQIA*+ people as oppressed, tragic victims. In my teaching memos and observations, there were instances of students’ classroom discourse itself a critical queer literacy—as they voiced resistance to oppression and heteronormativity, sometimes using their own lived experience as evidence for their views.  To answer RQ2, I have analyzed the ways that the students used the myriad text and media they were asked to read as a springboard for critical discourse. I believe I have identified some of the students using critical queer literacies, which I would define as literacy practices that destabilize normative constructions of sexuality and gender, foreground acceptance of diversity, and eschew homophobia and transphobia. Students’ critical queer literacies are fostered by educators who embrace culturally responsive pedagogy, promote queer-friendly classrooms, and read, interpret, and analyze literature, including YAL, that are relevant to students’ lives. Even as some of the students were reifying problematic constructions of sexuality and gender, or reading and analyzing queer identities as incomplete, some of them were simultaneously demonstrating critical queer literacy practices which stand to assert the significance of a pedagogy of love and queer inclusive curriculum. It is not entirely clear whether the students who were demonstrating critical queer literacies have a personal connection to the content (i.e., identify as queer or have queer family, friends24) and regardless the hope is that all students have developed a critical consciousness through frequent, close examinations of the world—as Pearl Street Collaborative High School’s pedagogical mission is intellectually rigorous, culturally relevant curricula that promote literacy,                                                 24 Here I want to avoid the suggestion that the students who exhibited proficient critical queer literacies are queer themselves or know, love someone who is. Yet, there are moments during teaching this queer inclusive curriculum when students (and adults) share a story or a personal example of why this content matters.    144  learning, inquiry, and critiquing the various forms of oppression that are at work in our city, country, and world. Students’ responses may have been enhanced by reading more than a dozen nonfiction and media texts and two YA novels all featuring LGBTQIA*+ topics and characters. In my second round of analysis of the data, in an attempt to define the critical queer literacy practices apparent in the students’ writing and discourse, I used the following codes to delineate the patterns that emerged within the theme of critical queer literacy.  Critiquing Oppression (and Heteronormativity) Across the data were students who demonstrated critical queer literacies in their critiques of oppression both in their discerning selection of passages from their assigned YA book club novels and in their responses to them. Their responses included critiquing normative constructions of sexuality and/or gender and analysis of various forms of oppression. At times they also asserted the significance of reading that centers queer content in school.  Ibrahim finds significance in Melanin Sun’s mother’s new relationship and asserts the relevance of From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun25 in his review when he writes:      Melanin is an African American male and his mother tells him that she is in love with a white woman. This brought in a really interesting dimension of race to the story and I think it made it that much deeper and more thought provoking for the reader. The book isn’t afraid to talk honestly about race and sexuality.  Similarly, in her review of The House You Pass on the Way, Alexa writes about the ways that race complicates oppression for Staggerlee when she says that she “also has trouble coming out because she will get judged more due to the fact that she is from a mixed [race] family and she may also be gay.”                                                 25 Again, see Table 7 for descriptions of central characters and conflict in all nine YA novels that students read during the unit.   145  In a response to Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, Margarita writes about Dante challenging Ari’s view that he does not like kissing boys when he has never done it. She does not focus on the sexual tension in the passage but reads this section as significant because it specifically shows out there about the hetero narrative because it shows...how in Ari’s head he was so used to the thought that kissing a boy wasn’t for him. It shows the effect that society was drilled into his head that liking boys wasn’t a question he needed answered, he assumed since that’s what he has been surrounded by. But he broke this narrative when he still decided to kiss Dante.  Margarita’s analysis supports that Ari has been influenced by a heteronormative world. Her subsequent questions that she writes in preparation for a discussion with her book club peers provoke further analysis of her thinking. She writes, “Why is Ari so submissive to Dante? Why did Dante do that? Will this ruin their friendship?” Her questions raise more questions: Is she so focused on their friendship that she’s concerned most about the maintenance of it? And is she cognizant of how physical intimacy can complicate a friendship? Ultimately, Margarita’s engagement with the text reveals a critique that serves to normalize attraction and desire, and the ways they can complicate friendship. Some of Aliyah’s responses to quotes from If I Was Your Girl and None of the Above seem solely based on her beliefs and worldview, and her writing goes beyond an analysis of the text, characters’ actions, and plot. She takes up for trans women and reading about people who “don’t get much representation.” Aliyah writes:      Everyone has the right to be the gender that best identifies them. People need to respect that and learn to treat people with respect and like everyone else. People deserve to live the life they want.  Teagan reads I’ll Give You the Sun as an opportunity to critique gender norms and articulate the ways they limit both Jude and Noah in her response to the following quote: “Is it possible our personalities have swapped bodies?” (Nelson, 2015, p. 146)   146  In Teagan’s analysis, she writes that Jude no longer fits the status quo because she no longer wears dresses or does what a girl is “supposed” to do. Noah has everything that Jude thought she once wanted and he dates girls, all because he stopped pursuing the one thing that meant the world to him—art. Teagan writes:      It is funny because that used to be Noah—not following gender as a social construct… but now he has switched from outcast to popular...is that even him? And is being the “weirdo” the right place for Jude?  David reads I’ll Give You the Sun as a way to interrogate the status quo, posits that Jude and Noah both are expected to be something they do not want to be—they suffer from expectations set by their parents and society as a whole. He writes:      Noah is gay and his dad thinks he should be into “guy” stuff like sports and wrestling. When people see Jude all they see are her good looks and not her personality. This is an example of how in society people are encouraged to be someone they’re not.  David continues his critique when he writes about the way Brian changes his demeanor when they unexpectedly encounter some girls from Noah’s school. He writes:      Everyone sees Brian as this jock who’s great at baseball, but underneath he hides a completely different guy. Brian acts completely different in front of girls they meet because he is pressured in society to act normal, unlike when he was with Noah.  Even as David’s use of the word normal is problematic, he uses it to critique a society that demands that high school athletes are masculine males who desire feminine females. He writes in his review of I’ll Give You the Sun and Two Boys Kissing that the authors convey ...society has to accept that being gay isn’t an illness or a phase. When Harry and Craig’s kiss went worldwide the response was equally supportive and jeering, the author wrote this to bring light how media is encouraging homophobia. The message in both books is that gay teenagers deserve the acceptance that others receive. Often books with the same message are not read in schools because many schools are afraid of offending their community. This view takes them nowhere because they never get the chance to experience this and change their opinion.     147  In Alessandra’s review of I’ll Give You the Sun and Two Boys Kissing, she seems to be problematizing the word normal by placing it in quotes and writes of the relevance of queer inclusion:      [Both books] give insight into the people who aren’t considered “normal” and how they feel and the things that they have to go through every day. Versions of their lives being told and heard everywhere is the first step in changing mindsets and that should start in schools.  Maia’s critique of Two Boys Kissing and her indictments of the community’s homophobic responses to Craig and Harry’s attempt to break a world record for longest kiss demonstrates a critical queer literacy lens. She uses emotional language that humanizes and expresses outrage for the marginalization of queer people. Maia’s feelings are likely intensified because of the relevance to her own lived experience—her own sister coming out as a lesbian and being embraced by her family. One of the theories Maia poses is that there are harmful stereotypes about AIDS that must be debunked (i.e., it is God’s way of punishing gays). She also condemns hatred in the text when she writes:      Wishing AIDS upon a person is an action for people who are horrible and disgusting. Two Boys Kissing expressing other hatred toward gay (anything) is so hurtful and horrifying to read.  Andrew, who at first objected to the second person narration by a chorus in Two Boys Kissing, acknowledged it was like no other book he had ever read prior. Not only was the structure of the novel compelling to Andrew, but the content was as well. When Cooper’s father verbally assaults him and throws him out, Andrew has a profound realization. He writes:      This made me notice a lot that I wasn’t really thinking of before. There are gay kids out there with parents who neglect or disown them for being gay. Since this is just one fictional example, that’s really upsetting to me.  In Alex’s book review, he touches on the ways that transgender people are marginalized when he writes, “Either queer or straight, If I Was Your Girl makes us see that it is hard to really   148  accept people who are different. Kristin [sic, should be Amanda] knows she is a girl and shouldn’t be treated differently.” Bernardo’s review of None of the Above indicates he has learned much about the ways that Kristin’s intersex identity has been maligned by a heteronormative society when he writes:      When people judge you for anything other than what kind of person you are or what is really on the inside, people tend to feel alienated and this can cause depression and other hardships. Throughout the book, people tend to question Kristin’s womanhood or feminism [sic] and that is not justifiable.  Across many of the nine different YA novels that students read during this unit, they were resisting dominant narratives about people with diverse sexualities and genders by critiquing oppression and heteronormativity. Students engaged in critical queer literacies to identify and condemn hatred in its many forms, and some voiced the relevance of queer inclusive curricula as central to the study of literature. Queer Identities and Humanizing Visibility  Some students demonstrated critical queer literacies in ways that affirmed queer identities and humanized visibility by disrupting heteronormative assumptions about what it would mean to disclose or be out for people with diverse sexualities and genders. This stood as a notable contrast to the responses in the previous section on normative constructions of sexuality and gender. Bruno writes about Kimiko’s empowerment in Boyfriends With Girlfriends: standing up for herself, coming out to her mother and demanding acceptance. He writes:      This is significant because [Kimiko] is not going to listen to her mom until she respects her like a regular person...people are showing up for themselves...makes me think that people should always have that attitude to stand up for yourself.   149  In Bruno’s book review at the end of the unit, he writes, “The message [of From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun] is to focus on family first and don’t let nobody prevent you from supporting [your family].  Ibrahim has a similar interpretation about the importance of family in his book review as well when he writes:      [From the Notebooks of Melanin Sun] shows how Melanin Sun learned to realize that this is and will always be my mother and her liking the same sex will never stop her from being his mother.  Margarita’s third response to If I Was Your Girl is to a quote about the dilation ritual Amanda performs as part of her ongoing recovery from gender affirmation surgery. Her response uses nonspecific language, avoiding specific terminology that makes it clear Amanda has transitioned. However, Margarita writes, “...she’s happy about what has happened...she finally feels like she is who she should be like she’s in her own skin...which shows liberation.” Laila resists the narrative in None of the Above, taken up by several other students, that Sam was duped by Kristin and instead shifts responsibility onto him for “childishly listening to rumors and abandoning his own girlfriend.” Laila also disrupts a pattern when she writes that Kristin does not immediately disclose her intersex diagnosis to Sam because it is something that takes time for her to process. Alma also theorizes Kristin does not feel safe to disclose when she writes, “The way [Kristin’s] father acts toward her makes it difficult for her to embrace and love who she is and that affects her decision of telling anybody the truth.”  Kayson writes that None of the Above teaches him how a lack of understanding and empathy affects people in negative ways and makes them coming out...ten times harder. Kristin  is having trouble understanding what is going on and the people around her not understanding what she is going through is hard for her.    150  In Alessandra’s response to the following quote from Two Boys Kissing, she articulates her support for the way Craig comes out to his parents:      “I’M GAY, MOM. I’M GAY. Craig rotates his and Harry’s bodies so he’s facing his mother. Then he holds up his shaky sign. He sees her eyes as she understands it” (Levithan, 2015, p. 82) Alessandra: Craig has been hiding who he was from his parents for like forever. Keeping a part of himself hidden in fear of rejection. In this moment, Craig has no choice, he’s been put in a tight situation where he’s split between accomplishing something he’s been planning for and coming out. Him choosing to do both at the same time showing his mother who he is and finally letting his truth out shows his strength.   In Emilia’s review of Two Boys Kissing, she begins to articulate the complexities of Tariq’s intersectional identity and condemns homophobia when she writes:      Tariq, Craig and Harry’s friend, is a gay black male in the LGBTQ community. One day, Tariq is physically assaulted by a group of boys because he was gay making it a hate crime. Levithan creates Tariq and introduces readers to his conflicts to help create awareness of intersectionality… It is important to read books like these about queer/ different identities because they help people who share similar identities to not feel alone or isolated.  Even though Emilia problematically positions queer people as different/other, she asserts that it is important to prevent hate crimes like the one perpetrated on Tariq and suggests that reading such material in school helps prevent it. At the beginning of the book club unit, after Isadora’s first glance at the cover of Boyfriends With Girlfriends,26 she objected to the assignment. Six weeks later, in her review of both of the YA novels she was assigned, she writes that “reading LGBT books in school is important for us to learn about.” Isadora further asserts:      We always hear about LGBT and we don’t give much thought about intersex, and if we were to go to a place and someone mentions they are intersex it will probably feel uncomfortable. That’s why we should give more thought to explore other identities and not have to label someone on their physical appearance.  Aliyah also asserts the importance of intersex visibility when she writes:                                                  26 Again, see Appendix E for the cover art for Boyfriends With Girlfriends.   151       [None of the Above] is like no other book. It tackles a subject that doesn’t get media attention like other members of the LGBTQ community. The theme is a significant matter that lacks in conversation. It is the first novel by the gifted I.W. Gregorio, an intersex activist, and a surgeon. This book gives readers an insight on the struggles of those who are intersex and the tough decisions they may have to make.  In Teagan’s review of I’ll Give You the Sun and We Are Okay, she writes, “No matter your gender, sexuality, race, or religion you are okay. We are okay.” She elaborates on her thinking further when she writes:      Jude and Noah each struggle with a piece of their identity that makes them feel uncomfortable and “less than.” Jude’s is her gender—being a girl leads her to want to disrupt gender norms and beat the boys at surfing the biggest waves but as she gets older social constructs wear down on her—her skirts get shorter and lipstick darker and she is put in a dangerous situation that will change her life forever. Noah is terrified of his dad’s reaction if he finds out he is gay. This thrilling novel leads Jude and Noah through dusting down barriers of the labels that possess them.  Even though part of the book review assignment was for students to consider the importance of studying LGBTQ literature in school, Kaito’s review of We Are Okay and Two Boys Kissing includes a compelling rationale for queer-inclusive curriculum:      It is important to read literature that disrupts dominant narratives in school because it helps the school gain more acceptance in diversity. By reading these stories, not only are we able to include acceptance as race, but sexuality as well. If we leave these books and stories behind, the students would have less perspectives through other people’s situations. LGBTQ people wouldn’t be as accepted and can lead to violence and harassment. These books can give students an idea of how everyone should be treated regardless of who they are.  Laila has a similar rationale. She writes, “If books didn’t try to disrupt dominant narratives then young people like me wouldn’t see that this world is really messed up and things need to change.” Laila’s review of If I Was Your Girl, celebrates trans visibility when she writes:      [This] coming of age love story will teach you about acceptance, love, and power. Not to mention but [the author] Meredith Russo is also a transgender woman, which made this book extra special because just to know these events probably did happen to her.  In Aliyah’s review, she writes:    152       I was happy when I learned that the author herself is a trans woman. This gives the story an authentic feel. I would’ve been content either way, but knowing the author went through similar things as the character makes it more natural.  Alex does not connect Amanda’s suicide attempt with gender dysphoria when he writes a response to the following quote from If I Was Your Girl: “Anything, anyone, is better than a dead son” (Russo, 2017, p. 11) Alex: I kept on thinking, what does the dead part mean? Amanda has had a tough time it seems, being at the hospital. Was it to do with the gender problem? But having a gender problem doesn’t lead to death so I have no idea. Hopefully answered soon.  In Alex’s sincere exchange between himself and the text, he doesn’t see a direct connection between Amanda’s suicide attempt and a “gender problem.” Also, gender problem is an interesting choice of words that I wonder about. He also writes a response to a small moment, but one that he finds significant because “it shows Amanda is cared for and noticed. Just even someone acting normal to a queer person is something that makes meaning in peoples lives.” Alex is the only student in this study who has used the word queer, suggesting it had already been part of his lexicon.  Alex again resists a dominant narrative about trans people in his response to Amanda asking her father to play catch. He writes that the moment symbolizes her empowerment. “I think [Amanda] has changed—much more brave and fierce to do anything she can. She can do what she wants to do.” In stark contrast to Alma (and interestingly they are in the same group), Aliyah’s knowledge of trans awareness/visibility appears in most of her written responses. I wonder how much her friendship with Sebastian is a factor.       “I wondered if a boy like him could ever understand what it was like to be me. To know what it was like to view high school as something you need to survive” (Russo, 2017, p. 16).     153  Aliyah’s response and analysis of this passage suggest she is able to understand Amanda’s perspective. I wonder if this is easier to do as a trans ally, as she is best friends with Sebastian, an out trans boy in class 2. Aliyah’s reading of this novel is similar to Alex’s (and my own). She writes:      Amanda feels disregarded because she is a trans girl, Amanda has been constantly disrespected by peers throughout high school. So when people like Grant converse with her...even though Grant’s intentions were pure and genuine, she still believes that they’re going to taunt her after all the things she’s been through and pass [sic] trauma.  This is an interesting read because Amanda’s experience in her new school has been only positive. In the author’s note at the back of the novel, Russo mentions she wanted to disrupt the victim narrative by having the character “pass” to show another angle, offer a counternarrative. Aliyah analyzes and is able to interpret Amanda’s anxieties about disclosure and (expecting to be) outed. These data revealed some of the students’ reading of YA literature critically by employing critical queer literacies that offer a more humanizing analysis of queer visibility and disclosure, one that takes into account the complex, exhausting, and unjust expectation that people with diverse sexualities and genders come out to maintain heteronormativity.  Diverse Sexualities and Genders as Multidimensional  The student artifacts and teaching memos also revealed students who were using a critical queer literacy framework that disrupted status quo narratives about sexuality and gender, in contrast with a previous section that found students positioning LGBTQIA*+ identities as emergent or incomplete. In this section, the focus is on students who avoided unidimensional portrayals of LGBTQIA*+ people and characters by instead taking up critical queer interpretive practices that were humanizing of diverse sexualities and genders.   154  Berto normalizes the budding romance between Sergio and Lance in Boyfriends With Girlfriends when he writes that Sergio feels a connection between them, but is reluctant to jump into a committed relationship with Lance because he “needs more time to relax and cherish being [newly] single.” When Alex reads None of the Above, he writes that “Every person who is different is beautiful” and humanizes Kristin, writing that it must take a lot of courage for her to have surgery so close to diagnosis. He wants her to forget Sam and choose Darren—who doesn’t “touch the subject of her being intersex and just has normal conversations [with her].” Maria condemns Vee in None of the Above for laughing when Kristin disclosed her intersex diagnosis writing that it is “disrespectful” and that it “must have hurt her.” Isidora writes that “Not being accepted is tough,” and how upset “Krissy” must feel after her boyfriend abandons her. In one of her responses to If I Was Your Girl, Maria misses the source of tension and misreads Amanda’s father’s fears for her physical safety (i.e., when she starts dating Grant) as him not accepting her as his daughter and further marginalizing her by not allowing her to date. I wonder if she does this because as a reader, she is perhaps unaware of violence that trans women face. He is afraid for her safety, saying:      “...you’re acting like a girl now. You’re acting like a little girl who’s so lovestruck she’s lost her mind” (Russo, 2017, p. 128).   Amanda is battling her father so she can date Grant, and Maria takes issue with the “little girl” part in her response. Maria doesn’t see things from Amanda’s father’s perspective and immediately defends Amanda. She writes, “[Amanda’s] moved there for a fresh start and now she was supposed to keep her head down and not do anything? This hits her hard…” Here Maria seems to identify with having a parent stand in the way of pursuing a romance. Her defense of   155  Amanda, and not seeing her as a victim that needs protection—as her father is doing, humanizes Amanda as any other teenager doing battle with a parent for autonomy. It is unclear whether Maria is relating to Amanda as a teen girl with a strict father. Danielle also writes a response to a moment of tension between Amanda and her dad. Amanda reveals her hurt that her dad was not present during her suicide attempt or transition surgery. But Danielle focuses on what is most important. “Amanda was going through something difficult and she wanted her father’s love and support however she didn’t receive it because he didn’t know what to do.” Danielle seems to universalize Amanda’s experience by not focusing on the transition. And with a queer parent who recently came out to the family, Danielle is perhaps responding to the significance of familial love and support from personal experience, even though she does not mention it here. Alessandra, the only student to write about Avery, a gay trans boy in Two Boys Kissing, writes about his decision to disclose to Ryan. She writes:      Avery has always been a boy and the thought of being considered something that isn’t is frightening. Yet, through revealing his truth him and Ryan are brought closer, since nothing will have to be avoided later.  Abigail normalizes the natural progression of the sexual chemistry between Noah and Brian in I’ll Give You the Sun. She disrupts a pattern when she theorizes that Noah already knows he is gay, but that Brian is the first one he has feelings for. Abigail, in contrast to the other students who read the novel, is the only student who suggests that Noah is not in search of his gay identity. In a response to We Are Okay, Inez normalizes (and avoids labeling) Marin and Mabel’s relationship when she writes:      ...in the beginning of their friendship, [Marin and Mabel] both loved each other just as friends- and neither of them gave any thought to the fact that sleeping together may be   156  awkward at some point…. Like Marin pointed out—Jacob wasn’t the problem. It was the fact that the two girls jurastically [sic] drifted apart.  Lucia felt strongly that because We Are Okay is not a coming-out narrative, or one that is centered on the sexual identity of the characters, it destabilizes heteronormativity because it is presumed that Marin and Mabel’s past relationship with each other is natural. In Lucia’s book review, she writes:      [The author] LaCour disrupts a dominant narrative by creating two LGBT characters, but not going into depth about their sexuality. In most books with an LGBT character,  the author will focus on the coming out story, the oppression they go through, or the attention they get for having a sexuality other than a heteronormative one. LaCour does a great job of not making that the focus of the story.… The book is an overall amazing representation of what talking about love between two people in the LGBT community should be like, just about the love.  Inez, in her review of the same novel, writes the powerful message in the novel is “there’s no controlling who we love and what is meant to be is what is right.” In these students’ written responses and discourse about the course content, they decentered heterosexist assumptions about LGBTQIA*+ and gender expansive people by humanizing, and not pathologizing, their multidimensional identities thus avoiding tragic, victim narratives that are too often the norm. Personal Connections to Queer Content A compelling, though perhaps unsurprising, finding in this study is that reading and studying a collection of media and nonfiction texts, some film and some print, coupled with two YA novels centered on LGBTQIA*+ characters led to some of the students making their own sexuality and gender identity visible (i.e., voluntarily disclosing to the class during a discussion) when they had not done so at any other point in the course. There were moments during the  6-week unit of study when students’ writing and/or classroom discourse included relevant personal anecdotes that were overtly connected to queer content. Some of the students who   157  identify as LGBTQIA*+ or those with queer parents, family, and friends shared this with the class, sometimes including details about how and when people came out. Their stories offer a counternarrative to those who would argue the relevance of queer-inclusive curricula.  In Olivia’s three responses to Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, rather than analyze the characters’ actions or plot, she writes personal narratives that connect to the text. In the first two, she compares Ari’s parents to her parents. In her third response, she writes a narrative of the first time she kissed a girl—Sofia. She writes, “I am bi-sexual and coming out was not really hard for me…. I am not ashamed to say that I am bisexual. I’m actually proud of who I am.” In a response to Two Boys Kissing when Cooper is rejected and assaulted by his father (when he invades his privacy and discovers Cooper’s sexually suggestive online chats with boys and men on his laptop), Maia writes how horrifying this was, and of the importance of queer kids being loved and accepted by parents and family. She includes an anecdote about her sister coming out as a lesbian to their family and their subsequent love and support of her. Maia takes up a critical queer literacy framework, interrogating the text and using her own life experience to challenge powerful social norms that seek to marginalize queer people. She writes:      Cooper’s story in Two Boys Kissing hit me the most. Having my own sister come out as lesbian and seeing how my family learned to understand and fight against homophobia brings Cooper’s story close to my heart. Seeing how he feels unloved by his own family and friends is heartbreaking and at some point brought me close to tears. A book that has the ability to make a person question society and have them strive for justice in an unjust society is a strong and empowering book. Two Boys Kissing was able to push my own thinking about society and help me further understand how I can make my own change to this unjust society we live in. Everyone needs a person to trust, a person to love and to get love in return. These books can inspire readers to look for ways to create a difference in society.  In my teaching memos, I also write about becoming emotional. While reviewing students’ exit slips (tiny written reflections at the end of class) in my curriculum planning   158  meeting with colleagues Cassandra, Mateo, and Rosaline, I am overwhelmed by the significance of Sofia’s exit slip when she writes:      Personally I am bisexual so this [curriculum] does speak out to me. I love this unit and love how in a school we are able to talk about this and share our opinion. We will not be judged for anything.   Prior to beginning this unit of study, and to reading Sofia’s exit slip, I did not know that she identified as bisexual. It is reasonable to assume that her sharing this with me (and eventually with the rest of the class during the accountable talk discussion) was a direct result of teaching queer-inclusive curricula.  In my observations of the accountable talk discussion, when students finished reading the first of two YA novels in a book club, Olivia and Sofa in class 1 shared personal stories about coming out as bisexual, and Olivia and Abigail both discussed gay cousins’ experiences and the ways that each of their experiences were received by their families. Both implicitly offering compelling rationales for reading queer content in schools, because of the ways that reading means more to people when they see themselves in stories. In my teaching memo, I note that Olivia said when she started dating girls people told her, “I didn’t know you were like that.” Olivia added that her brother is homophobic, called her “nasty” when she came out, but eventually accepted her because she is his sister—rationalizing that she “can’t stop” herself. In class 2, Sebastian shared an anecdote about being policed by peers in his former school for not looking “like a stereotypical girl should” until, with the support of his friends, he came out as transgender. Sebastian added that there was a boy who used to bother him, but that Sebastian changed his mind and he felt empathy for Sebastian. Perhaps the details are too personal, or Sebastian is referring to a boy the students know, and he does not elaborate further. But sharing personal stories about one’s own identity changes the climate of the classroom and   159  humanizes the space. Their analyses of the queer content seemed to become more meaningful when students revealed their own lived experiences as evidence for their ideas. When discussions about text move into who we are as human beings, it becomes difficult to discount someone’s lived experience. Danielle spoke about her mother coming out as bisexual 2 years ago and how her grandparents learned to accept it, adding that she knew for a long time and did not care. Jordan added that his sister is bi, but that it went undiscussed—a non-event. By contrast, Aaron’s gay cousin was not accepted by their grandparents, who are “old fashioned” and do not accept him. This hangs in the air until Jordan adds that he does not understand why people care who other people have sex with. Jordan asserts that school is a place of extremes (i.e., viewpoints), worse than the outside world, especially in regard to LGBT people. Danielle and Jordan add they think that people are afraid of what they are not used to, afraid of change. Jordan adds that there is really no reason to hate other people and cannot understand why people “overthink things and want to deny someone a basic right—like using the bathroom.”  In the accountable talk discussion, some of the young people seem to be reading, interpreting, and analyzing diverse sexualities and genders as a problem that needs to be solved. But some present solutions that include acceptance, visibility, empathy, and dismantling the idea that straight is normal. More than one student (most notably Jordan and Danielle) resists accepting status quo notions of a heteronormative society and they postulate theories that include fear of the other and change, and what it means about who we are. But several students also confirm the notion that this might mean more to you when someone you know or in your family is LGBTQIA*+.     160  Part III What happens when teachers use collaborative planning to design curriculum that intends to disrupt heteronormativity and facilitate students’ reading of YA queer literature? To answer RQ3, which is centered on teacher collaboration and its potential for curriculum design that intends to disrupt heteronormativity in the classroom, I initially set out to analyze two sets of data—interviews and memos/observations. After an analysis of the memos/observations data, they did not reveal enough information about this research question, since the majority of my memos/observations did not capture information about the collaboration and planning meetings with my colleagues, and was instead focused on students and my teaching. Therefore, unlike the previous sections devoted to RQ1 and RQ2, for RQ3 I could not identify themes or codes that cut across more than one different data set. However, in my analysis of the interview data, the following themes cut across the nearly all four interviews with the four different participants: Queer-inclusive (culturally responsive) literature, text, and media; (Therapeutic) collaboration and developing (queer) pedagogies; and Teaching “against the tide” (of heteronormativity). Queer-Inclusive (Culturally Responsive) Literature, Text, and Media The importance of spending time on collaboratively selecting literature and text for the queer book club unit that would be culturally relevant and engaging to students, along with the availability of queer content housed in Pearl Street’s library and English classroom libraries came up in nearly every interview. Since none of the prepared questions I used to guide the interviews were focused on the selection or availability of LGBTQIA*+ themed reading materials, this added an important dimension to the study—which sought to fill a gap in existing classroom-based empirical research on students’ reading of YA literature, and in this case, queer   161  YA literature. Although the responses that refer to queer content do not directly answer RQ3, they bear relationship worthy of analysis because most participants seemed to view students’ access to queer reading materials as significant to creating a queer-friendly school culture— one conducive to teaching a ninth-grade queer book club unit that sought to critique heteronormativity. Availability and Access: (Culturally Relevant) LGBTQIA*+ Themed  Literature, Text, Media  I ask each of the four participants to discuss the extent to which Pearl Street Collaborative High School is queer friendly. Anna27 discusses the special collection of LGBTQIA*+ themed books that she curated for the library, which is prominently featured. She says the collection “is often one of the things people see when they come to tour the school” which, she adds, contributes to its queer friendly reputation. Anna also says, “Our students aren’t seeing themselves in publishing…” which is her mission. Anna adds:      Close to seventy-five percent of [PSCHS’s library] books at this point either are about people of color or are about LGBTQIA people or are about an underrepresented population…. A huge portion of my buying [for the library] is very deliberately trying to fill those gaps…. I think the GLBTQ collection probably trends whiter than I would like, but it is hard to find books about certain populations that are also people of color.  Anna elaborates:       Online, in social media, and in the public there are a remarkable number of really wonderful, outspoken people of color who identify as LGBTQIA… they are an incredible resource and that feels very different than even five years ago and certainly ten years ago.  In Roseline’s interview, she also mentions that Pearl Street Collaborative High School is queer-friendly because of the availability of LGBTQIA*+ themed fiction when she says:      I think almost every English teacher [at PSCHS] or the majority of English teachers have a bin in their classroom libraries for…explicitly issues that are queer friendly or characters again or authors…and the school library as well.                                                  27 See Table 2 for more information about the adult participants.   162  Collaboration on the Selection of (Queerly) Responsive Literature, Text, and Media  All four participants suggested that collaboration aided them in selecting reading material for students that would be culturally responsive and inclusive of a diverse array of LGBTQIA*+ identities. Anna: You and I spend so much time talking about [LGBTQIA*+] books because  you’re trying desperately to find reflections of our student body and it’s really hard…. I spend a lot of my energy looking at book lists and reviews about populations that are underrepresented both in publishing and in my [library] collection. I spend a lot of time with the history team around collecting and teaching the non-fiction materials that are connected to GLBTQ history.   Roseline further discusses the queer-friendly aspects of the school, its attempts to teach queer inclusive curriculum, and the advantages of the scheduling that supports time for teachers to plan collaboratively. She says: ...some of the efforts that we’ve made to include content that includes either characters who are queer or I would say LGBTQIA or authors who are…I think there are efforts to do that. I think we have a staff, particularly on the English team, who are open to that, for sure…. I try to support English teachers to identify mentor texts [with] authors who identify as LGBTQ or again will focus on the issues maybe around LGBTQ issues  in their writing. Like, being able to support teachers with… looking across the scope  and sequence of the year and identifying like where are there places that reflect [LGBTQIA*+] experiences? Are there enough of those? What can we do if there are not enough? And maybe sometimes it’s just naming it if we can’t solve it right away.   When I ask Roseline to discuss the day-long meeting during which Cassandra, Mateo, and I planned and designed the queer book club unit collaboratively, she says:      ...being able to have the space and time to think about [LGBTQIA*+] issues with a variety of texts. So then it felt like a lot of the time was spent thinking about the shorter texts, videos, learned a lot about the high five [laughter] and we read other short texts that also would resonate with students… that would be great for students to make it feel more like… like the two [YA] texts could be the anchor, but all of this other work could help situate and just enrich what you had already brought to it...I thought that was really awesome.   I also ask Cassandra to discuss the day spent planning the unit, and she says:    163       And I think it was helpful...like in my recollection of [the planning] day is we spent a lot of time finding secondary texts because I think that we had kind of [already] ironed out the [YA] book club books. So having that time to find the “High Five” video and all these other texts and videos that became really meaningful as the unit went on...  Mateo discussed his experiences with queer-inclusive teaching:   ...in teaching history, in the identity and society unit we’ve always had [LGBTQ themed] articles. We’ve always taken on every issue pertaining to identity: race, class, gender, sexual orientation.  As Mateo talks about the history curricula he developed, he states and restates that it was not as in-depth as the queer book club unit in English class. He says he believes that the unit’s focus on gender and sexuality allowed the students more time to “take everything in.” Centering Student Engagement and Interest  Three of the four participants I interviewed mention that they believe reading and studying LGBTQIA*+ themed literature is meaningful and engaging to students. Anna: I put books with GLBTQ people in kids hands constantly…. I have a remarkable number of kids who will ask me for a book with a GLBTQ character or something related…and it’s very clear that it’s not because they’re questioning their sexuality necessarily right now, it’s just a thing that’s happening for them that they’re interested in.  Cassandra: I think that learning about heteronormativity was like a really big thing for a lot of my students…you know even students who had like no problem and were very open and accepting of LGBTQ people, like I think that they just didn’t realize that they were making a lot of assumptions about all people. Like this idea of heteronormativity and we just assume that all people are straight…. I don’t think that’s how really a lot of kids thought at all. And so I think knowing the word heteronormativity now, knowing what it means, I think really did change the way a lot of them think about like… everything. Which was awesome.  Mateo describes a moment with Sofia, a bisexual student in class 1, as they viewed images of men being shoved into paddy wagons by police, during the Vito Russo documentary segment on the events in NYC leading up to the Stonewall riot of 1969.      I was sitting next to Sofia and she just kept turning to me because she wanted to…she was speaking to the struggle she didn’t even know about. As someone who identifies as   164  being a part of the LGBTQ community, she was like “I didn’t even know that was like… you just got arrested for being gay? Like, what?”   Mateo speaks about the accountable talk, when he took half of the students in my class 1 to another room for the discussion (as is the norm for such discussions, to allow for all students to participate since there are no more than 13 students when a class is split in half). Near the end of it, he asked the students what they had to say about the notion that the nine novels in the book club unit are banned in many school districts because they are deemed inappropriate since they deal with LGBTQIA*+ themes.      Like all these kids…and literally so many, almost all of them spoke as to why… speaking to how they could relate to the character [in their YA book club book]. Others saying, “Well if we can’t…if we don’t [read queer literature] we’re just going to remain ignorant.” That was Maia…. Then our students that we know who are openly part of the LGBT community, like, they were hype! They were like, “Damn. This is…this [book] is [about] someone like me, like I can relate to that.”  “What Does the Instruction Look Like?”—Teaching “Against the Tide”  (of Heteronormativity)  Nearly all of the participants spoke about wanting to develop their practice or to see how educators navigate teaching queer-inclusive curricula and that such topics are largely absent from teacher preparation programs and in-school professional development initiatives. At Pearl Street Collaborative, which has a reputation as a queer-friendly school with its out teaching staff, the prevalence of queer iconography in classrooms and common areas, and one of only a few LGBTQIA*+ special library collections in the NYCDOE, there is an expectation that teachers include queer content, despite a lack of confidence or training on how to best engage in doing so. Since the practice of teaching that includes LGBTQIA*+ themes and issues has not been an explicit, school-wide initiative, and there is little training or professional discourse in recent years, the Pearl Street Collaborative High School teachers I interviewed want support to effectively carry culturally responsive critical queer literacy curriculum into practice.    165  Observing Queer Inclusive Teaching in Action When I ask participants what resources they would need or want to plan, prepare, and teach queer inclusive curricula, Anna and Roseline have similar responses.  Anna: Part of me wishes that there were five hours of video of people doing this work...it’s really important to watch the dynamics, watch the teacher, manage the room… I’m feeling more and more like I want to watch some people do it.  Roseline: I think it would just be great to see classes and schools in action...are there places, or what do those places look like? And what does the instruction look like and what does the interpersonal rapport between students and across students and teachers...or students and adults look like in the building? I feel like I’d want to see that in action.  It is perhaps of note that none of the participants mention observing the queer-inclusive teaching that is happening at Pearl Street, or its potential for (re)activating professional discourse. There have been at least two prior full staff teacher training workshops at Pearl Street Collaborative High School in the past 18 years to address the importance of queer-affirmative teaching practices in support of queer and gender expansive youth, but the conversations have not been sustained in ways that have been utilized consistently by teachers. Lack of Professional Development/Discourse Related to LGBTQIA*+ Issues and Content In my interviews, I ask all participants to discuss their experiences with teaching queer-inclusive curriculum, prior to the ninth-grade queer book club unit. Anna says she cannot recall any “explicit classroom teaching” except for “historical moments… about LGBTQ people during the [WWII] Holocaust” during her experiences as a teacher. When I ask Cassandra about her experience teaching LGBTQIA*+ content or themes, she says, “ I don’t think I really had any...that I can think of…and I didn’t receive any training on it at Pearl Street and it’s just something that we’re expected to do, but nobody tells us how to do it.” Cassandra suggests that more work as a staff would enable her to be a more effective teacher of queer inclusive themes and topics. She says:   166       The [Undoing Racism] training that we did earlier this year was really helpful. And I think that in grad school similar topics were discussed at length, it was like a big focus of my grad school so I just wonder if this could be incorporated more into teacher training and more into [professional development workshops] that we do in house, because I do think that our school...like administration prides itself on being very open and accepting but like it’s easy to say...like I love... I’m open and accepting and I like saying that but I don’t really know how that translates into my teaching. And I think that it would be nice to have somebody tell me how to do that.  Lack of Teacher Training and Preparation for Queer-Inclusive Teaching All of the participants, except Mateo, say their teacher training excluded or made little mention of queer inclusive teaching. Anna’s teacher preparation program “did not acknowledge that gay people existed.” She adds she uses the term gay because of her age, often uses it to mean “the umbrella of LGBTQIA.” Anna adds there were acknowledgments “of the complications of class and race in education, but no explicit instruction on how to do something about it.” Roseline says, “I definitely did not learn about any of this in my own teacher training program.” I ask Roseline if her teacher training included any anti-oppression curriculum and whether it was inclusive of LGBT themes. Here is an excerpt of the interview: Roseline: There was absolutely no mention of it, whatsoever at all. In my entire program. Not at all. JMC: Did your training to become an administrator include any LGBT content? Roseline: God no. Absolutely not. Not at all. JMC: In your doctoral program? Roseline: I can’t think of a single thing. I cannot think of a single thing in any of my courses. I even took a course on youth culture and I cannot think of a single thing that was said.  Roseline adds:       I did not come here [to Pearl Street] thinking that it was important to have…to like feature [LGBTQIA*+] books in my classroom library as a teacher. And I think I, I learned that. And I learned the importance of that along the way here...just of making it visible and explicit helps and is important.   When I ask Cassandra if her teacher training addressed teaching anti-oppression curriculum and whether it included queer themes, she says:    167       Anti-oppression literature yes, but I don’t remember anything specifically around LGBTQ+ themes…I just think that it’s something we don’t get any training on, and I didn’t receive any training on it when I was getting my Masters.  In contrast, Mateo responds that his university teacher preparation program was both racially diverse and that he has “peers that were openly gay,” but adds that the program “could have been more explicit with regard to LGBTQ rights.” Exploring the Tension Between Freedom of Expression and Disrespect During Anna’s interview, she mentions that she views the teaching staff at Pearl Street Collaborative believes that “gay is ok” with a caveat:      I think a significant portion of our population is very uncomfortable with the idea that there’s anything but two genders…the idea of nonbinary...makes them uncomfortable and as a result, they reinforce lots of the binary, they reinforce a lot of gender norm behaviors.  Anna adds that this is especially problematic since  our kids…many of our kids come out of very homophobic environments. So we’re…we are working against the tide, which means it often takes years for kids to change their behavior.  Roseline, Cassandra, and Mateo suggest that upending powerful gender and sexuality norms is hard work and queer-inclusive teaching must allow for students to grow at their own pace. Roseline says:      I think teaching at our school or any school where you are trying to work with issues around social justice in general...but you are also trying to teach critical thinking skills. No matter what the issue is or what the topic is, I think there is probably some fine line we have to balance with like...are we imposing our viewpoints on you? Are we expecting you to think for yourself? I think it’s just always worth thinking about those things.  Cassandra adds:       I would say like in one of my blocks I had maybe like six, it was all boys, so like six boys who were very, like really did not want to do this unit. They said that it was something that they had studied multiple times at Pearl Street. They didn’t understand why we were doing it again. They felt like it was something that was kind just like being shoved down their throats. A popular refrain was that like “It’s English class, why are we   168  learning about social issues?” And then when I kind of just like put those…I was like “We’re reading books, we are studying literature. I don’t really get this argument. Have you read these books before? Because if you have then that’s problematic…” And none of them had read these books before so I was like “I don’t really get it.” Then, like other stuff came out…such as like “This makes us uncomfortable. We don’t feel comfortable. We don’t like reading about this. We don’t like talking about this.” So like, I mean I think that both me and my co-teacher had a lot of like long conversations with these students about the unit. I don’t know if these conversations changed anything. They didn’t seem to, but I don’t know what effect they ultimately had.   Mateo says:  ...Both Cassandra and I... us taking a step back and reminding ourselves of the point of the unit…because, you know, we’re teachers and, you know, we have our viewpoint as well. Not taking it personal was huge, and both Cassandra and I speaking about that, and literally having the conversation of like, it’s…we can’t write the kid off, no matter how ignorant the kid might be at this moment. It’s a matter of we’re teaching and we’re learning and listening and exposing them to things. And so, both Cassandra and I just like, wow, that was very intense. But hey, we’re back at it tomorrow just in regards to the reading and the writing and the thinking and the reasoning and the synthesizing. But again to answer your question, we had that time to take a step back to remind ourselves why we’re doing it, and it’s not about a student getting something right now. It’s all about growth and where that student’s gonna be down the line just in regards to being…how can that student engage and interact with their peers, in both… in a social matter, right? Like both in intellectual and an intelligent way, as opposed to, “Well I don’t like this group of people, and that’s it.”   Building Confidence With Professional Support   Cassandra is open about the expectation that Pearl Street teachers engage in and instinctively knows how to enact queer-inclusive teaching without sustained professional development, coaching, or community discourse. She says:      It’s really frustrating because it’s a big deal and you don’t want to do it wrong because it affects the people in your classroom. But somebody has to sit down and tell you how to do it correctly and nobody does. So it’s hard. So really any training. I know that’s not specific. Sorry.  In spite of this pedagogical challenge, Cassandra adds:        I don’t necessarily feel like I’m going to be successful...when I teach [this unit] again, but I feel like I’m going to do it again and like I want to.    169  When I ask Mateo what he would need or want with regard to additional resources to prepare to teach and design a curriculum that intends to disrupt dominant discourses about LGBT youth of color, he says:      I think any time we’re going to teach anything, just getting our hands first on stuff for us to read and listen to…I don’t think we could ever read or educate ourselves enough on an issue or topic.  “We’re Not Meant to Be Alone”—(Therapeutic) Collaboration and  Developing (Queer) Pedagogies  Both during Mateo’s interview and later analyzing the transcript, I was struck when he spoke about the restorative, therapeutic nature of collaboration, especially as it pertains to teaching that intends to work against widely held beliefs about LGBTQIA*+ identities by moving their experiences to the center of the curriculum. Further analysis of the interview data through the lens of RQ3 underscored participants’ beliefs that collaborative planning meetings are sites of empowerment, enabling participants to process difficult moments with students and to work together to develop humanizing pedagogies designed to support the social-emotional well-being of all.  During our interview, Roseline’s eyes welled up with tears when she said, “We’re not meant to be alone,” in discussing Marin, the protagonist of We Are Okay, her favorite of the YA novels selected for the unit. In Mateo’s interview, he discussed the safety he experienced with colleagues, and how that worked against the pervasive isolation of teaching. Taken together, these ideas position collaboration as a catalyst for developing therapeutic and humanizing queer-inclusive pedagogy. The participants resoundingly experiences collaboration as crucial to their teaching practice and their ability to navigate the complexities of teaching queer-inclusive ELA, despite very little (or no) previous experience with such teaching.    170  Therapeutic Collaboration  In all transcripts except Anna’s, the participants spoke about the methods of collaboration that went into creating a unit of study that intended to disrupt pervasive notions of gender and sexuality as not only a source of gaining comfort with the curriculum design, but also as a way to counter the inherent isolation of teaching. In Roseline’s discussion of We Are Okay, her favorite of the YA novels selected for the unit, she shared the about the significance of isolation. She said:      I understood a lot and could empathize with [Marin, the protagonist of We Are Okay] in like…the extreme sense of loneliness that she was feeling throughout so much of the story…. Her interactions with people were so infrequent, then those felt so profound too…and left lasting impressions on me. And I think that...the ending was just incredible. The ending was an incredible way to tie up the story because it felt like it was about at the very end of the day, whether or not you can embrace this idea...you need people because it’s just a human trait—that we need to be connected with other people. We’re not meant to be alone.   When I asked Mateo whether there were any particular curriculum planning meetings that stood out to him, he touched more directly on teacher isolation when he said:      In general, just having each other, for us...like a place for us to exhale. And, oof, like...and just to communicate with each other just about where students are at emotionally with the unit. Where we were struggling. It’s not to feel isolated as a teacher.  Mateo continued by adding how the meetings gave him comfort as the unit went on:      I feel super safe with you, with Cassandra. And so that within itself allows...I feel it just allows me to just every day just keep goin’ through...like I don’t feel like I can’t say what I’m feeling or what I’m thinking around both you and Cassandra. So that within itself...it’s just...there’s no price on that.  Cassandra, who spoke candidly about pedagogical difficulties and lack of training, said that after teaching the queer book club unit for the first time, “I feel like it’s something that I feel more comfortable doing again.”     171  Building (Pedagogy)ical Consensus  At Pearl Street Collaborative High School, there is time built into the school schedule for teachers to collaborate and plan curricula with each other. Planning meetings happen three times weekly during a common period that students take electives or physical education courses so that their core subject area teachers across each grade level have time together. In addition, the Principal of PSCHS has committed to offering teaching teams the opportunity to take an entire day to examine student work, reflect, and plan out a unit of study by first determining the learning objectives—a variation of backward planning methodology that is laid out in Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe’s (2008) book Understanding by Design. My interview questions included asking teachers to discuss the ways that both the planning day and subsequent triweekly planning days supported teaching the queer book club unit that was the subject of this dissertation.  Roseline: I guess first I would say just about some of the things about [curriculum planning] days in general, I feel like…I know it’s not like a regular thing that people do at other schools. I also feel like, I don’t understand how you could really teach without them in a way. Because…especially if you’re on a co-teaching team. To be able to flesh out ideas together about like all the things…all the backwards planning aspects. Like what do you really want kids to be able to learn? And be able to do? And to know? And to be able to transfer as a result of being in this unit for however many days? And then what are the discrete activities that we’ll do to make that happen? Like…that should just be a given, that teachers need that time…to really be able to think through a unit…. The pedagogical choices that you were making were about situating the unit in a number of short texts that also reflected LGBTQ issues. So they…it wasn’t like this is a unit on these two books that you’re going to read alone, but really just being able to have the space and time to think about…these issues with a variety of texts.   Cassandra: I think it was really good to have everybody on the same page and kind of like create a unit together that we were all comfortable with and on board with.   Mateo: Man, the [planning] day was super important. Just for us to have…us as teachers, to be on the same page. Us as teachers to take things in. Us to visualize everything.      172  Troubleshooting Difficulties and Pedagogical Dilemmas Roseline, Cassandra, and Mateo talked about moments of difficulty both in the planning and teaching a curriculum that intended to disrupt heteronormativity and facilitate students’ reading of YA queer literature. Roseline referenced the planning day when she said:      I think…and I remember sort of bringing this up on the [planning] day and you know, just this idea like…knowing the group of students who you taught, but really I think it would just…it would be just worth doing for any group of students…like, knowing that you have, you know you each teach like some fifty students and they will all respond… they all have different dispositions towards…just even hearing the word gay. Or thinking about…they’re going to read characters who identify as LGBTQ and what that means. Or authors. And they’re going to be reading texts and writing about it, and either just given my own teaching or my coaching, that might sometimes be problematic for students. And so that was something that I…I know we talked about. And I think it was hard to talk about it. But I also feel like it was really important for us to talk about.   Mateo mentioned how helpful he thought this part of the full-day planning meeting was when he referenced a poster that was created as a result of this discussion that Roseline initiated. He said:       Um, that poster28 that we made as to why we were doing [the unit] was just super powerful. In the fact that we posted it…I even, in conversations with students in class like, literally, I pointed to the poster…. There was a group of students that were very…yeah, it was a lot. And I literally remember sitting in front of the poster with them like look. This is…no one’s trying to change your mind about anything, right? It’s just we’re exposing you to something we want you to come to your own stuff, right. Cause they were just super…pushing back like, as if we were trying to indoctrinate them with something…and so I really remember like sitting in front of the poster like, “Let’s read this together.” So that time in the [planning] day where we can have a grasp as to why we were teaching this unit was super powerful. You coming in with your background and expertise was super beneficial, just to listen to you. And then you bring in Roseline, right and then all of us being able to just have a…like it’s like you’re going on a trip and you don’t have directions. How you’re going to get to where you’re trying to go? So I think it was good. It would have been a mess if we didn’t have a [full planning] day, to be honest.   When I asked Roseline if any of the day-to-day planning meetings were particularly memorable, she said:                                                 28 See Appendix D, Why This Unit?   173       I do remember a student in the other [teacher’s] class…I think it was on an exit slip… maybe you all brought them to your meeting and you were going through them and actually, I don’t…Oh okay, now I remember the name of the student. I remember…I can see her now. But like something about her exit slip…. I don’t know it just felt like an unfortunate response. I don’t remember exactly...like “Why do we have to study this again?” kind of thing, or “Why do we have to study this?” And even though I think you had…you and your team had taken the steps to be like this is not a queer unit, this is more about disrupting dominant narratives…I guess for the student at that moment, it still felt like she was being told to do, or had to do, or forced to do something that she saw as like we’re reading about gay people. That just felt like such a reductionist way to view all the things that you really were doing in the unit, and that to me felt…that felt unfortunate.   Cassandra: I think it was really helpful to just think about logistics… to have time to think about logistics of groups in a really meaningful way because I think that that was a really difficult component to it…just like thinking about personalities in the [class]room and where they should be and who they should be with.  I asked Cassandra if day-to-day planning meetings offered her strategies to deal with difficult moments in this unit, and she said:      Definitely. Because it was…it was nice to be able to have more time with my co-teacher in those meetings, but it was also really helpful to hear perspectives from teachers who were not in my room to kind of just get other ideas that were really helpful.  Teaching That Centers Students’ Social-Emotional Well-Being  When I asked the adults to talk about Pearl Street Collaborative as a queer-friendly school, all four participants referred to a collective consciousness to prioritize the social-emotional well-being of every young person in the building at some point during their response.  Roseline: I think that at our school, we do try to see each student individually for who they are and in a way that acknowledges their presence, whether it’s as a student and I hope and I believe as a whole person. I think that advisory helps with that. So while that’s not an explicit queer-friendly routine, I think because of our efforts to get to know each student, and support each student’s development across the time that they’re here...We want to be able to take into account all of who you are, including your sexuality or how you identify.   When I asked Anna if she believed the special collection of LGBTQIA*+ books in the library have anything to do with whether students come out to her, she said:   174       Yeah, yes. I mean, I think very much so...you know we have lots of really successful queer kids at Pearl Street who never came to [the GSA] but it’s [the GSA’s] existence that says something to them about what other people in the building are trying to do. And that’s what those books do.  Cassandra also referenced the importance of students’ well-being in her interview while she talked about PSCHS as queer-friendly, something she said she had not thought about before. She said:      I think that because it’s small and because there’s such an emphasis on like social-emotional.... Like on students’ social-emotional like well-being that it...I guess it’s not like an explicit thing but I just feel like…I like to think that students feel like safe to be themselves here more so than maybe other places. It’s not perfect. Definitely. But when I think back on like my high school experience being in like a big suburban school, I like to hope that Pearl Street...people would feel more accepted at Pearl Street but, you know.  Mateo shared an anecdote about how his concern for his students sparked his involvement with the school’s GSA when he was a new teacher. He said:      Those first two years I would just go to the [GSA] meetings…and just in solidarity and support… Just because…especially then…just so many of my students, especially boys, were so homophobic…I just wanted to be like an ally…you know an ally that was out there for, especially for my young men who were very homophobic…to see me… and for students that weren’t out, to see an ally and someone they saw every day teaching them…so yeah. So yeah and this just continued.  Mateo added:       And just from what I see and speaking to students, I feel it’s safe enough to be out. And just conversations in the classroom, outside the classroom…. So yeah, I would...And the signs on the doors,29 which you know, as small as it may seem, is so huge. And so… and just teachers freely speaking to issues in our community around gay rights and so on and so forth.   Powerful, Humanizing (Queer) Pedagogy  Amid the difficult moments, Mateo, Cassandra, and Roseline shared anecdotes from the classroom, sometimes a lesson, sometimes an interaction with students, that held significance. These snapshots of the participants’ experiences suggest that the end result of a collaboratively                                                 29 See Figure 3, a laminated “Safe Zone” sign posted on the majority of classroom doors and in learning spaces at Pearl Street Collaborative High School.   175  planned unit that intended to disrupt dominant narratives about sexuality and gender, while it was difficult to do, became meaningful as the unit drew to a close. Roseline: ...just watching the video of two [NBA] basketball players who are men, in a field that is like so masculine…just I guess probably most like televised professional sports are…being able to talk about things like feelings and emotions in the way…in such an honest way that they did was...I don’t know, it was very powerful for me to watch it. You don’t really…Kevin Love is not gonna say those things in a Sprite commercial or on the Wheaties box. And so then…or on the basketball court, so then like doing that was just…yeah, it was just really…I thought it was really powerful. I think it was powerful for kids to see also like…that people are so many different ways and there’s not just… We live in a world that has imposed on us very narrow ideas of what it means to be everything, and this video did a nice job of disrupting that. I really…for me it did, and I hope for kids it did as well. I believe for kids it did.   Cassandra: I think that that day we went to see “Love, Simon” [special screening for high school students at the Paley Center for Media] like really…it was a nice culmination to the unit ‘cause I think that certain parts of the unit felt…and by certain parts, I mean dealing with certain students during the unit felt really hard. But it definitely felt like so worthwhile that last day and not even just like, I mean yes definitely the way kids were reacting to the movie was like really beautiful and felt, it felt like it validated a lot of the like…not validated the struggles in the unit, but it just like made everything feel worthwhile...I think it showed that they did end up caring about this whether they did before or not I think this unit changed some of them…for like…made them better, more understanding, empathetic people. So, that sticks out.   Mateo: So, I would say that moment in accountable talk. Even though there’s so many more. Um, it was really just…it struck a chord in just…again, as humans, I feel like we all need validation in some way, shape, or form. As a teacher, to hear students, like, say…and then I did ask, “Should we do this [unit] again next year?” And they were like, “Definitely.” That was dope.  Concluding Thoughts About the Role of Collaboration in Curriculum That Intends to Disrupt Heteronormativity and Facilitate Students’ Reading of YA Queer Literature  For the four teachers at Pearl Street Collaborative High School who participated in this study, who mostly reported they had no prior experience or teacher training to design queer-inclusive English language arts curriculum or how to effectively teach it, the collaboration was essential. Most of the participants expressed a desire to have more formal instructional training and professional development to do so. Despite a lack of experience and, at times, confidence,   176  the teachers in this study, out of necessity due to a lack of professional guidance, created their own pedagogies informed by a pedagogy of love that prioritizes the social-emotional well-being of all students. They embraced critical pedagogy that intends to critique the oppression of all people, regardless of gender, race, ability, sexual orientation and works, to disrupt oppressive structures that are upheld by traditional literature selections and heteronormative dynamics in schools.  What went unsaid in the interviews is that teaching that critiques heteronormativity is especially challenging since it destabilizes the gender binary and focuses on the oppression of LGBTQIA*+ people, which continues to be a source of contention and debate in American society. Therefore, teaching that asserts the humanity and inclusion of queer identities threatens social norms, is deemed irrelevant, and is largely absent from teacher training. Some of the teachers in this study reported that the students, even the few who were resistant to learning about queer people, were able to identify with the teen protagonists in the novels they read and believed they were more empathetic at the end of the unit than they were at the start of it. So it would seem that teachers working together to create a unit of study that included preparation for encountering resistance and justifying relevance led to the creation of a curriculum that not only humanized queer identities, but centered the lives and experiences of youth—utilizing both YA literature and culturally responsive text connected to student interest, which, according to the participants, made an impact on students.     177  Chapter V IMPLICATIONS  Overview When I conducted my practitioner research as an insider (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 1993) of my ninth-grade English class at the queer-friendly public Grade 6-12 Title I school in New York City where I have been teaching for my entire 18-year teaching career, my central aims were to understand and examine the collaborative development and implementation of a queer- inclusive English language arts curriculum; the ways a racially and socioeconomically diverse student population reads, interprets, and analyzes YA queer literature; and to what extent queer pedagogy and an anti-oppression curriculum impact young people.  Nine YA novels were selected as the central texts for a book club unit, during which students were grouped with two to four peers for a 6-week period and were assigned two queer-themed YA novels to read, discuss, and analyze together. During the unit, named Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Club, students also read, watched, and discussed a collection of nonfiction and media organized around the theme of interrogating heteronormativity while making connections to the YA novels they were reading in their book clubs. During class, students sat with their peers in book clubs and to prepare, their homework was to bring in questions, significant quotes, and written responses to discuss. After students finished the first novel, the class was split in two, and they had an accountable talk discussion—a student-led Socratic seminar-style dialogue during which they talked, across the novels, nonfiction, and media text, about the most significant ideas being presented using text and their own experiences as evidence for their ideas. Next, students read another YA novel, again using their own questions and meaningful citations as the basis for their in-class discussions. When   178  students finished the second novel, each wrote a book review of both novels, and with their group, they designed and created a poster or video to present to the class to raise awareness about civil rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation and gender. I collected three sets of qualitative data during and after the unit. First, I gathered the teaching memos and observations that I wrote during or immediately following my teaching and collaboratively planning the curriculum with teaching colleagues. Next, I assembled all 44 of my students’ (mostly hand)written homework responses to the two YA novels they read in their book clubs and their typed book reviews, which composed the bulk of the data for this study. Finally, I made audio recordings and transcriptions of my interviews of the four colleagues who were part of designing and or teaching the ninth grade Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Club unit at Pearl Street Collaborative High School. I analyzed each data set through the lens of each of the three research questions and their associated subquestions, noting patterns and discrepant patterns to identify themes in order to code data accordingly. What follows is a summary of key findings for each research question. Research Questions What happened when ninth-grade students engaged in a study of YA queer literature in a public, Title I, queer-friendly high school in New York City? Queer visibility was engaging to students and culturally relevant. Queer visibility in this curriculum, as it pertained to teaching YA LGBTQIA*+ themed literature in a high school English classroom context, was culturally responsive as YAL is a genre that seeks to engage and empower queer youth and, thus, all youth. Much of the data revealed students making an identification with or a connection to the empowerment of a teenage character.   179  Students made personal connections, saw themselves, and learned about others during a unit that intended to disrupt heteronormativity. While reading a variety of fiction, nonfiction, and media, students shared stories of their own, or family’s and friends’ coming out, disclosing both sexual orientation and gender identity. This was not the first unit of study during which students made meaningful connections to text, but in this case, by making sexual orientation and gender identity visible in the classroom, it served to humanize and bring queer identities out of the margins and into the center, which was unique to this queer-inclusive curriculum. Empathy was articulated in both teacher/student classroom discourse and students’ written responses to queer inclusive curriculum. Much data revealed authentic expressions of empathy for both fictional characters and people’s experiences featured in nonfiction and media text.  Students and adults used various modes of empathizing that included expressing emotion, stating outrage, and using storytelling to build connections to text. Compared to the rest of the literature that ninth-grade English students read over the course of the year, students and adults demonstrated authentic expressions of empathy in response to queer-themed content that was studied during this unit, which served to further humanize queer identities and queer-inclusive curriculum. Though it was infrequent, all of the teachers encountered uncomfortable pedagogical dilemmas. There were moments of discomfort, especially in response to feeling underprepared for student resistance to queer content. In an effort to appeal to the minority of student resisters, teachers may have unwittingly positioned students as homophobes, by posting a   180  “rationale” for the unit.1 During teacher interviews, nearly all reported that they had no teacher training or professional development in recent years related to queer pedagogy or queer-inclusive curriculum development. Teachers expressed a desire for opportunities to deepen their knowledge and understanding of how to teach in ways that attempt to destabilize heteronormativity and better support their students, especially those with diverse sexualities and genders. How did reading and writing that centered on analyzing YA queer literature reinforce or disrupt normative discourses about LGBTQ youth? Students identified examples of empowered queer adolescents across the YA novels. They found common ground with characters as teenagers across the novels, which affirmed the decision to use exclusively YA fiction for the book club and served to aid in disrupting dominant discourses about queer youth. Students noticed and wrote responses about empowered queer characters (who learned to overcome obstacles, self-accept).  Some students read LGBTQIA*+ identities as a “secret” identity. Some of the students’ written responses to the (queer) characters across the novels were that they were adolescents in the process of “finding themselves” or “figuring it out,” which serves to both disrupt and reinforce normative discourses about LGBTQ youth. Some of the students’ responses also used the word “secrets” repeatedly, which connects to themes of coming out, and their commentary, reactions, and opinions about the characters’ experiences with visibility.  How did students read, interpret, and analyze diverse sexualities and genders? Students’ spoken and written commentary demonstrated critical queer literacies that disrupted norms and served to humanize a diverse mosaic of sexualities and genders. The passages that students selected from their YA book club text to respond to revealed critical                                                 1 See Appendix D.   181  engagement with texts that served to disrupt normative depictions of LGBTQIA*+ people as oppressed, tragic victims. In their responses, students voiced resistance to oppression and heteronormativity, sometimes using their own lived experience as evidence for their views.  Students critiqued normative constructions of sexuality and/or gender and analyzed various forms of oppression, including race. Some students were able to identify the ways  that race complicates oppression for LGBTQIA*+ people. At times, they also asserted the significance of reading that centers queer content in school for the ways they were able to read and write about fairness and justice for all people. Students engaged in a critical analysis of gender norms that hurt everyone. Students grappled with the pressure and expectations to perform assigned gender roles, often at the expense of a character’s happiness or well-being, placed on them by society, parents, and peers. Their responses to this, especially students who read I’ll Give You the Sun and None of the Above, included an indictment of how athletes encounter enormous pressure to perform masculinity and femininity, and the ways those are correlated to sexual orientation (i.e., female athletes must perform femininity to attract masculine males). Students expressed emotions and profound realizations in their written responses to instances of homophobia and transphobia in the novels. Their use of language to express outrage, emotion, and condemnation of hateful acts was powerful. Some students learned, from fictional characters, the devastating, unimaginable cruelty of being rejected by a homophobic parent. Student learning seems to have been enhanced by reading more than a dozen nonfiction and media texts and two YA novels all featuring LGBTQIA*+ topics and characters. In some instances, students articulated normative, problematic constructions of sexuality and gender both in their writing and classroom discourse. It was perhaps to be   182  expected that many ninth-grade students would hold us/them ideas about queer identities, since much of literacy learning does not include literature that explores themes related to sex, bodies, sexuality, and gender. This finding was especially compelling because students, even as they shared cringeworthy ideas, simultaneously demonstrated authentic engagement and interest in examining such topics.  Some students read diverse sexualities and genders as a choice (and an idea that can be disagreed with or discounted all together). Students need more time to learn about sexuality and gender so they can understand that identity cannot be simplified as being a choice, and those who believe such have the most to gain from maintaining status quo notions of gender and sexuality. The few students who acknowledged sexual orientation or gender identity as a viewpoint that can be argued or a “lifestyle choice” did not do so maliciously, but it is a very harmful idea that literacy can help illuminate and facilitate humanizing discourse that works to counter oppression. In an effort to affirm queer identities, some students made problematic assumptions about disclosure and coming out. Statements such as “You shouldn’t hide who you are, just be you” revealed a lack of understanding about heteronormativity. Students were not yet able to critique the notion that people with diverse sexualities and genders are at a disadvantage in a heteronormative society for the ways that disclosure and coming out are complex and the insistence for doing so is unjust. How did students resist dominant narratives about people of diverse sexualities and genders? Students humanized queer visibility by disrupting heteronormative assumptions about what it would mean to disclose or come out. Across several novels, students wrote   183  thoughtful responses of support for characters engaged in the conflict that can accompany visibility. Students identified passages in the novels that highlighted agency and liberation that came as a result of visibility. There were responses of support for transgender characters, including how Amanda in If I Was Your Girl felt post-transition and how gender-affirming surgery liberated her.  Students normalized queer characters’ experiences by identifying with their conflicts with parents. Students spoke up for and took sides with adolescent characters engaged in battle with their parents.  Students humanized queer characters’ feelings of sexual chemistry and attraction. Across several novels, students wrote responses that normalized the progression of sexual chemistry and attraction, and both the associated emotions and the ways it can complicate friendship. Students spoke and wrote about their own lived experiences and those of their families and loved ones. For some students, that meant coming out during a classroom discussion; for others, it meant writing about how their family bond grew stronger after a sibling came out. By bringing their own lives into the classroom, students added an important dynamic to the learning space. Critiquing heteronormativity is one thing, but doing so by using one’s own lived experience humanizes the experiences of people with diverse sexualities and genders. How did students subscribe to dominant narratives about people of diverse sexualities and genders? Sometimes students’ discourse about diverse sexualities and genders created an us/them dichotomy that centered heteronormativity. Even as students positioned themselves   184  as allies, some made generalizations about the marginalized status of LGBTQ people and may have perpetuated a disempowered victim narrative.  People with diverse sexualities were interpreted as having emergent identities or somehow incomplete. In nearly all of the novels, even those that focused on gender, there were characters with diverse sexualities. There was similar language used by the students who analyzed characters’ sexualities as indicative of a struggle with self even when none existed, although they were less frequent than they were in the novels that focused on gender identity.  Characters with diverse or complex genders were often interpreted as victims. Many of the students who read None of the Above and If I Was Your Girl at times interpreted Kristin and Amanda as characters not yet possessing full autonomy or agency, as a result of their marginalized identities as intersex and transgender teenage girls. Many YA novels are thematically tied to issues of self-discovery and coming of age, but it was a compelling pattern that so many of the students were writing responses to Kristin and Amanda being subjected to bullying and taunts for the ways their intersex and transgender bodies upset their peers.  What happened when teachers used collaborative planning to design curriculum that intended to disrupt heteronormativity and facilitate students’ reading of YA queer literature? Teachers said they believed that the availability and vast array of queer-themed reading materials contribute to a queer-friendly school culture. Teaching a curriculum that intended to counter powerful and pervasive heteronormativity was facilitated by a school culture that supports doing so. My colleagues talked about the important message that having queer books in classrooms, classroom libraries, and featured prominently in the school library sends to students and prospective students and their families.    185  Collaboration supported teachers with selecting the (culturally responsive) reading materials for the unit. The teachers said that meeting both in regularly scheduled planning meetings, and in one full-day meeting before teaching the unit began, gave them time to select meaningful reading material meant to engage students.2 Since this teaching, the unit coincided with the baseball and softball season, with many ninth-grade students on the teams, teachers made a point to include articles about queer athletes and the ways that sports are traditionally heteronormative. Teachers were open about the lack of training to confidently carry out queer-inclusive teaching. They shared that there is an expectation that English teachers use queer-inclusive material in curricula, but little follow-through on how to best carry it into practice in ways that affirm LGBTQIA*+ identities and disrupt heteronormativity.  Collaboration facilitated teachers’ ability to navigate the complexities of teaching a queer-inclusive curriculum. Working together during regularly scheduled planning meetings and opening up to each other about pedagogical dilemmas and challenges served as a catalyst for developing therapeutic and humanizing queer-inclusive pedagogy.  Consensus about how to prepare for encountering student resistance to queer content was difficult. Teachers believed that creating a poster3 outlining the rationale for teaching the queer book club unit was helpful. I did not agree with some of the language and felt it may have unwittingly positioned the students as straight homophobes, which further marginalizes and endangers LGBTQIA*+ students. The poster was designed based on the talking points that came up, as part of a difficult conversation during the full-day curriculum planning                                                 2 The selection of the nine YA queer-themed novels for the book club unit was done collaboratively as well and took place over the course of about 4 months, but was done so before the full-day planning meeting took place. Since the research questions did not examine the selection criteria, a discussion and analysis of the literature that was selected for the unit are beyond the scope of this dissertation. However, I do summarize how the nine novels were selected in the upcoming section on Implications for Practice. 3 See Appendix D.   186  meeting. I made the decision to hang the poster in my room despite my feelings because I did not want half of the ninth grade to review it and the other half to not, since at the time I was not sure if I would use my teaching colleagues’ students’ written artifacts (in addition to my own students’) as data. At the end of the unit, I was still not confident about that choice. Collaboration reduced teachers’ feelings of isolation and increased their ability to problem solve and prioritize students’ social-emotional well-being. Teachers made references to the importance of knowing their students well, but also to the fact that having time to work with other teachers as a team was restorative and crucial. Toward a Theory of Culturally Responsive Critical Queer Literacy Pedagogy  I believe that because much of my data involved collecting students’ written responses to queer-themed YAL, practitioner memos and observations, and a collaboratively designed curriculum that intended to disrupt heteronormativity, my study fills a gap in existing literature about young adults and queer-themed YAL in classroom-based studies. Additionally, since I was not able to identify empirical studies that examined a correlation between YAL and empathy in adolescent readers and its potential significance in adolescent literacies, my findings in the previous chapter suggest a gap in the existing scholarly literature on queer-inclusive ELA curricula and critical queer literacy pedagogy. I set out to show that by engaging in a queer-inclusive ELA curriculum and by reading a variety of culturally responsive text—selected by teachers who embrace a pedagogy of love by knowing their students well, centering their voices, and facilitating humanizing discourse about literature—students would be able to use reading and writing as a means to critique oppression and thereby analyze hegemonic structures that uphold heteronormativity. Since the data were composed largely of the written work of my ninth-grade students and my own teaching memos   187  and observations, this was not a victory narrative. The work revealed there is much that can still be learned by teaching that is meant to engage students in embracing difference and the pedagogical challenges that surround the endeavor. Implications for Research In an attempt to theorize a critical queer literacy pedagogy that centers queer adolescence and culturally responsive curriculum to advance adolescent literacy, I assert there is a need for further research that examines classroom-based studies of YA literature and its impact on students’ literacy learning and engagement. I believe too few studies have examined practitioner research and queer-inclusive curriculum, perhaps for the ways my own research revealed the pedagogical challenges of teaching to disrupt normative assumptions that people hold, in particular about sexual orientation and gender. But using literacy to explore these harmful, pervasive narratives does much for students, especially youth who have been made to feel that their lives do not matter for the ways their experiences have been marginalized, complicated by intersectional oppression, and ultimately excluded from literacy curricula.  I assert that practitioner research that examines queer pedagogy can make a significant contribution to critical queer adolescent literacy—one that honors queer youth and families who have been largely ignored in secondary education, despite growing research that reveals learning to critique the status quo supports student learning, literacy, and academic achievement. Deconstructive reading practices that center adolescence and peel back the layers of heteronormativity position students to be critical readers of society and the world, which can lead to empathy as a precursor to action for social justice. An analysis of the data I collected from my ninth-grade students, my teaching and curriculum planning memos, and interviews with colleagues support a theory of taking a queer approach to English curriculum design and   188  pedagogy—one that situates queer YA literature within an anti-oppression curriculum and utilizes inquiry and group work to engage students in reading practices that critique heteronormativity and what that can do to support literacy learning.  Theoretical Implications Theorizing culturally responsive queer pedagogy for practitioners is an area that would support teaching a queer-inclusive curriculum. While designing the unit at the center of this study, I used the existing literature to help me select the literature, but there was surprisingly few works that could assist me and my colleagues to design the curriculum in ways that supported what we wanted to do—facilitate students’ reading of YA queer literature in an attempt to engage them in disrupting normative discourses about sexual orientation and gender. Seven Implications for Practice  There is more to learn about what happens when adolescents engage with queer-inclusive curriculum and the pedagogical choices that support teachers who use literacy in an attempt to counter oppression and disrupt heteronormativity. I assert the implementation of queer-inclusive culturally relevant pedagogy, bolstered by collaboration and reflection on practice, is vital to students’ literacy learning and achievement. This study also underscores the need for sustained professional development that will support educators to gain confidence and proficiency at using anti-oppressive pedagogy. My call to educators is for pedagogical practices that secondary educators (and teacher educators) could adopt to design and teach queer-inclusive language arts courses. Based on the findings in this study, even as it was limited in its scope, I assert there are implications for literacy pedagogy and curricula that go beyond Pearl Street Collaborative High   189  School. What follows are a set of practices that support a critical queer literacy pedagogy centering queer adolescence and culturally responsive curriculum. 1. YA literature affords students opportunities for deep inquiry and critical queer reading. The use of YA novels, because they are generally written to appeal to an adolescent audience and often contain a youth affirmative message, situated within a curriculum that seeks to engage students in a critique of heteronormativity, holds promising potential. With little prompting or scaffolding, YA literature supports students’ ability to independently develop questions and theories about characters and conflict. YA literature is usually what students read for pleasure, so given the opportunity to demonstrate critical literacy they have already learned to apply to more literary works, they can usually engage in high-level discourse with reading material that is designed for their enjoyment and learning.  2. YA book clubs foster agency, inquiry, and student engagement. Book club curricula are designed to be student-centered. Furniture is often rearranged so students sit with their club members and class time is devoted to students discussing their own questions and analyses of the novels that are not teacher-directed. Therefore, students in book clubs have more autonomy—they can set the schedule for reading, facilitate discussions about text, develop new lines of inquiry working in a small group, and motivate each other to come prepared to engage in work that becomes more meaningful as their reading of a novel advances. My colleagues and I gave students a protocol and a rubric4 that included self-assessments of their day-to-day work.                                                 4 See Appendix B.   190  3. Students are able to see themselves in YA queer literature. Reading means more when readers see their experiences reflected in the books they read. Selecting queer-themed YA literature for a curriculum that seeks to disrupt normative discourses about sexuality and gender has the potential to facilitate a dynamic exchange between the reader and the text. Designing culturally responsive curriculum is at its most effective when teachers know their students well by taking an interest in their affinities and lives outside the classroom, and ultimately engaging learners.  4. Select books, nonfiction, and media that feature characters and people that look like your students. It took a long time and it was a challenge to select the nine YA novels for the queer book club. I read nearly 20 novels, some literary and some YA, before deciding to use the nine exclusively YA books, which was also a suggestion from a literacy researcher with whom I consulted. In addition, I had some of my students read books that I was considering for the unit. Looking across the novels, nonfiction, and media that served as the central texts, there were people and characters with diverse identities in terms of their race, gender, language, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, and gender identity. That said, the YA novels did have more White, middle-/upper-middle-class protagonists than my colleagues and I would have liked. Our central aim was to select texts that included a diverse range of intersectional identities, with careful attention to avoid privileging the White middle-class LGBT experience, because of the ways it neglects queer youth of color and does not adequately reflect the majority of our students. Consult with professional colleagues inside and outside of the school building when making these choices.   191  5. Stories matter. Students’ analyses of the queer content seemed to become more meaningful when they revealed their own lived experiences as evidence for their ideas. Some engaged in interrogating text by using their own stories to challenge powerful social norms that seek to marginalize queer people. When discussions about text move into who we are as human beings, it becomes difficult to discount someone’s lived experience. That is not to suggest that one person’s (or fictional character’s) experience pertains to all people’s experience. Take care to avoid essentializing.  6. Teaching to that intends to disrupt heteronormativity can be emotionally taxing. Connecting with colleagues or supportive administrators or coaches is helpful. Reflecting on teaching and strategizing affirmative queer pedagogy can sometimes require support. Teaching that goes against status quo notions of gender and sexuality can be emotional work, especially when there are moments that indicate students, parents, or other teachers question or resist the merits of queer affirmative curricula. 7. Collaboration and professional support aid the creation of queer-inclusive curriculum and critical queer pedagogy. I treasure that I work in a collaborative teaching community. But this is not a requirement for teaching that embraces a culturally responsive critical queer pedagogy. A community of educators, researchers, and professional supports is available to teachers who want to enact humanizing, queer-inclusive social justice-centered pedagogies including: GLSEN https://www.glsen.org/ GLSEN, a nonprofit organization devoted to “championing LGBTQ issues in K-12 education since 1990” provides the most comprehensive queer affirmative resources, research, and advocacy, at the federal and state levels and internationally, for youth   192  and their educators. There are GLSEN Chapters in most of the 50 states for youth and their teachers to connect, grow support, and share resources with.  GLSEN Professional Development: Toolkits, Webinars, Workshops https://www.glsen.org/educate/professional-development Anyone can access GLSEN’s professional development page, and schools or teams of teachers who want to learn together, can easily access toolkits, webinars, and request in-person workshops for teaching teams, schools, and/or districts that want to create better school climates and inclusive curricula.  The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) Statement on Gender and Language (2018) http://www2.ncte.org/statement/genderfairuseoflang/ There are free downloads of the NCTE Statement on Gender and Language, a vital resource containing up-to-date recommendations, terminology, and a list of annotated resources with embedded links, all grounded in research for teaching that affirms all genders. The Statement can be copied and disseminated without permission from NCTE.   Looking Forward: What Future Research Could Do  Reading research has great potential for further illuminating just how powerful reading can be for the ways it can transform a reader and humanize a learning space. The reader matters even more than the text, for it is the exchange that really matters. But when the text also matters, for the fact that it is a narrative that expands a reader’s notion of what it means to be a human being, then it would seem that what the reader brings to text and what the text teaches both matter very much. But the literature is not the curriculum, and teaching a book uncritically, especially one that explores oppression, difference, and trauma, can be harmful. So pedagogy is also tremendously important. Reading means more to readers when they see their experiences reflected in the pages of a book, like looking at a mirror. Reading can also be a window into another experience that might be different than one’s own, but meaningful just the same as difference seems to slip away when there are perhaps other ways of connecting with a fictional character. Stories connect us as   193  human beings. Reading can teach people to embrace difference, critique injustice, and love everyone.  For me, being an English teacher is the best job in the world. I am able to share a love of literature and reading in a collaborative community alongside colleagues I admire, meet and grow to love a new group of students every year, and teach critical reading and writing in ways that center my students as human beings. The moments of difficulty and discomfort that queer-inclusive teaching illuminated revealed that there is more work to be done. Even in a queer-friendly school like Pearl Street Collaborative High School, with much more visible support for LGBTQIA*+ people than many other schools provide, curricula that examine topics such as same-sex desire, gender identity, and oppressive norms must continue if schools are to acknowledge inequity and contribute to social change. For many of my students, their responses to the YA literature and multimodal texts revealed they were engaged and ready to critique social norms for the ways they oppress people of all genders and sexualities.  When Sofia first learned we would be studying queer literature and said, proudly, “That’s my unit,” my understanding was that she was very excited to embark on reading about LGBTQ themes and I was thrilled. What she did not tell me until the teaching actually began was that she is “a proud bisexual teenager” and the curriculum really spoke to her. That moment in particular makes queer-inclusive teaching a must. I do not believe the timing of Sofia coming out to me was a coincidence. The classroom became a place where she could be visible and discuss literature that dealt with issues pertaining to gender and sexuality, issues that are of great importance and relevance to all, regardless of orientation, gender, race, ethnicity, or ability. Future research should aim to better understand the experiences of the students who learn a queer-inclusive curriculum, especially for the ways that visibility can increase vulnerability for   194  young people who identify as queer or who may be questioning their orientation or gender identity. Since I was limited to my students’ artifacts as data for this study, future research should engage these students about their experiences with queer-inclusive curriculum utilizing additional approaches. Follow-up focus groups and one-on-one interviews with my now-former students could also shed light on determining how to improve teaching and curricula that seek to at once celebrate queerness and challenge oppressive social norms and, by so doing, spark social change. Some of the young people featured in my study would likely be interested in youth participant active research (YPAR) to further engage the school community and other schools to support a theory of culturally relevant queer pedagogy and youth activism. In addition, several teachers at Pearl Street Collaborative High School are teaching a queer-inclusive curriculum. Since this study focused on a ninth-grade YA book club that was being taught for the first time, it would be useful to study the experience of teachers who have been engaged in teaching queer-inclusive curricula over the course of several years. My own teaching duties prevented me from observing classrooms outside of my own, but doing so would be an important next step to theorizing culturally relevant queer pedagogy. English teachers who love teaching, love their students, love reading, and put critical literacy at the heart of their practice can and must prevail in these troubled times. Teaching can be a lonely, heartbreaking enterprise. Collaboration and regular contact with colleagues and connecting with the professional community are crucial. Future research that further illuminates a culturally relevant queer pedagogy has great potential for critical queer adolescent literacy, which seeks to prioritize dismantling oppression and has the ability to engage youth as critical, empathic readers of the(ir) world. I believe the 44 young people whom I was so fortunate to teach and come to know are a testament to the personal stories, meaningful connections to text,   195  vulnerability, and empathy that are possible when the English classroom becomes a place for challenging powerful norms—especially those about gender and sexuality—and that doing so reveals what really matters: love, acceptance, and respect for all people at all times, most importantly for ourselves.     196  REFERENCES Allan, C.

For the final Exhibition, you will do two things: 1.      Write a book review of the two YA books you read. (individual) 2.      Complete and present a final project that raises awareness and promotes civil rights and respect for ALL people regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. (group) You will choose from the following options: ●      PSA (Public Service Announcement)—a short video with visuals, charts, or a skit designed to raise awareness and show support ●      Zine—a comic book that raises awareness and shows support ●      Posters (similar to PSA)—a series of posters with slogans, logos, visuals designed to support and raise awareness ●      Article for the East Sider—that discusses the importance of reading queer lit, and/or raises awareness and support  Day-To-Day Responsibilities and HOMEWORK A. Read up to the page your group has decided. B. Each night you must select a passage you believe is significant and mark the page with a sticky note. Then, in your notebook copy the quote and page number, and write 1-2 beefy paragraphs that analyze the passage and include why you think it is significant. C. Prepare for Discussion Each day your group will discuss the reading. Each group member must bring one big open-ended question to discuss the hw reading. You should also bring in ANY other questions that arise while reading, and be prepared to share your passage if time allows. *For full hw and classwork credit, you must complete A, B, and C!  Key Terms for the Unit: Queer:  One definition of queer is abnormal or strange. Historically, queer has been used as a slur against people whose gender, gender expression and/or sexuality do not conform to dominant expectations. Some people have reclaimed the word queer and self-identify as such. For some, this reclamation is a celebration of not fitting into norms/being “abnormal.” For some, queer is a radical and anti-assimilationist stance that captures multiple aspects of identities.  Social Justice: A goal and a process in which the distribution of resources is equitable and all members are physically and psychologically safe and secure. Begins with an acknowledgment that oppression and inequality exist and must be actively dismantled on all levels (Adams, Bell, & Griffin). Intersectionality: A term that describes the way that multiple systems of oppression interact in the lives of those with multiple marginalized identities. Intersectionality looks at the relationships between multiple marginalized identities and allows us to analyze social problems more fully, shape more effective interventions, and promote more inclusive advocacy amongst communities. Heteronormativity: A set of lifestyle norms, practices, and institutions that promote binary (only two) alignment of biological sex, gender identity, and gender roles; assume heterosexuality as a fundamental and natural norm; and privilege monogamous, committed relationships and reproductive sex above all other sexual practices.      207  Name____________________________                Book #1: ____________________________ Reading Calendar for Book Clubs   Book #2: ____________________________  Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday   1 Meet with your clubs, review expectations, and set reading schedule!

CHECKLIST: \u0000 Your book review should be typed, double-spaced, 2.5-4 pages \u0000 Your book review should include the name of the books (underlined or italicized), the names of the authors, and the years of publication. \u0000 Your book review should analyze both of your book club books, and include a quote from each book. Your book review should look for connections and differences that exist in your book club books. \u0000 Discuss author’s choice! How is the author using language? Who narrates the book? Who is given voice in the book and who is silenced? \u0000 Discuss the message of both books. \u0000 Include relevant and appropriate background information, but only as needed. Do not simply summarize both books. \u0000 Your book review should discuss the message about society that your authors are conveying. \u0000 Establish a formal tone (more New York Times than Goodreads. If you want to use an informal tone, be sure that you are doing so in a very sophisticated manner, using academic language). \u0000 Be sure that your feelings about the book are conveyed with subtlety.  \u0000 YOU MUST include one concluding paragraph discussing why it is important to read literature that disrupts dominant narratives in school. \u0000 Vary the length of your sentences. Mix short sentences with longer ones in the same paragraph.     209  Appendix D   Why This Unit?  [Rationale, Posted in 9th Grade English Classrooms]  ● To get out of our bubbles ● To empathize with others ● To learn about ourselves ● To examine and disrupt the harmful gender & social norms that hurt ALL individuals ● It is NOT about changing minds but about considering & reflecting on the materials we’re reading and watching ● It is NOT a queer unit, it is a disrupting dominant narratives unit ● We know you have a lot to say and we want you to dig in  ★ When you are uncomfortable if you can’t ask a question respectfully, pause before speaking. Think about how this might affect classmates. Write it down and talk to your teachers after class.

    "abstract": "This qualitative practitioner research study examined a ninth-grade young adult (YA) queer book club curriculum and culturally relevant pedagogy. Students read two out of nine queer-themed YA novels paired with a collection of nonfiction and media on topics that ranged from rethinking gender norms in society to historical issues that impact people with intersectional queer identities. The author collaboratively designed, planned, and taught the 6-week unit at the center of the study, Disrupting Dominant Narratives and Queer Book Clubs, using a critical queer pedagogy framework. \n\nThe findings illuminated the ways in which pedagogy that nurtures and prizes student voice, critical reading, discussion, and humanizing classroom discourse work to situate students as empathic critical readers and writers of the world. The findings suggest that analyzing queer- themed literature moves students to build empathy, disrupts oppression, and humanizes people of all identities, thus empowering youth as producers and consumers of knowledge that facilitates their growth and supports queer and questioning youth. In addition, students found common experiences as teenagers with the queer characters across the novels, therby affirming the decision to use exclusively YA fiction for the book club and serving to aid in disrupting dominant discourses about queer youth. The study concludes with a suggestion for seven implications for practice and a call for further research that aims to advance culturally relevant queer pedagogy",
