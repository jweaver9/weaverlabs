One way schools can reduce bullying and increase \nsuccessful learning environments is to include trade books that feature gender and sexual \nminorities. State and national standards set expectations for social and emotional \nlearning as well as critical analysis of high quality reading materials. This research \nanalyzed trade books from the 2013 and 2014 Rainbow Lists which were chosen by the \nGay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Trans gender Round Table of the American Library \nAssociation as the best books published with LGBTQ content the previous year for \nreaders under the age of 18. Forty-seven books at the fourth through ninth grade levels \nwere coded for genre, character identity, role, portrayal, reading levels, Cass (1979) \nStages, bullying events, profanity, and sexual content. Profanity and sexual content were \ncoded to anticipate community objections. Suggestions for the use of specific books in \nclassroom situations are discussed. \nKeywords: LGBTQ, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, fiction, nonfiction, bullying \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT \nAcknowledgements \nThank you, Dr. Bickford, Dr. Reven, Dr. Kory, and Dr. Moyer for answering \nevery question and sharing your expertise with me.

of Middle Level Trade Books with Gender and Sexual Minority Content \nIn spite of efforts to welcome diversity in American public schools, members of \nthe lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (hereafter, LGBTQ) community \ncontinue to be underrepresented in the curriculum (Kosciw, Greytak, Palmer, & Boesen, \n2014, p. 96). California is the only state in the nation to require inclusive curriculum \n(California Board of Education, n.d.) while eight states have laws that prohibit a positive \nrepresentation of gender and sexual minorities in schools. The so-called \"no promo \nhomo\" states are Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, \nTexas, and Utah (Lambda Legal, n.d.). Between these extremes, many states and local \nareas have antidiscrimination laws and anti-bullying measures that might allow for \nreading materials, instruction, and class discussions about gender and sexual minorities \nand the issues they face. The Human Rights Campaign publishes an interactive map that \nsummarizes various legal issues, including anti-bullying and anti-discrimination laws for \nall fifty states (Human Rights Campaign, 2016). \nLiterature Review \nIf teachers wish to include information about members of the LGBTQ community \nin their classrooms, what materials are available and how do they justify their choices to \nthe administration and the community? In this study, I addressed these questions by \nreading fiction and nonfiction books written for middle level readers. As I read, I took \nnote of how gender and sexual minority characters were portrayed, what happened to \nthem, and how their stories could be used to help students understand themselves and \nothers. I also recorded potentially ban-worthy content like profanity and sexuality to help \ninform an educator's choices. I also took note of bullying with the intension of \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT \nhighlighting books that would spark discussion on justice, fairness, and compassion. In \nthe end, I hope this research will be used as a tool to help teachers and parents find just \nthe right books for their unique situations. \nEducational Psychology of Adolescence \nMiddle school is a time of transition for students. Boys and girls are entering \nadolescence and experiencing new and confusing physical changes. Students are also \nchanging cognitively and emotionally. Educational psychologists have viewed \nadolescence as a time of moving from Jean Piaget's (1977) concrete operational stage to \nthe formal operational stage. Piaget observed that the cognitive processes of children in \nthe early elementary grades were linear and based on cause and effect. As they matured \nand entered the formal operational stage around age twelve, they began to have a greater \ncapacity for abstract thinking and the making of moral judgments. Giedd, et al. (1999) \ndemonstrated that adolescent brains are in a period of growth and change, but it is a slow \nprocess that continues for many years. Erik Erickson's (1968) theory of psycho/social \ndevelopment focused on another aspect of adolescence. He described individuals (ages \n12-18) as facing Identity versus Role Confusion. In this stage students seek to define \nthemselves, discover how they fit into society and envision a future for themselves. \n8 \nMiddle school teachers have the important task of helping students through the \ncognitive, social/emotional and physical changes of adolescence. The middle school \nmodel was created with this in mind and is composed of the following characteristics: \nteam teaching, interdisciplinary teaching, advisory programs and exploratory curriculum. \nTeam teaching allows for several teachers to focus on a small group of students across \nthe content areas. Interdisciplinary teaching encourages common content to be explored \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 9 \nthrough the lens of various subject areas. Advisory programs place students in small \ngroups with one adult for the purpose of focusing on the social and emotional aspects of \nlearning. Exploratory programs allow students to try new things and develop talents like \nacting, music or art. The Association for Middle Level Education (2010) has clearly \nstated that the most effective middle school environment, the one that creates overall \nacademic success, is the one that deals with cognitive as well as social and emotional \ngrowth in students. The Illinois State Board of Education, in coherence with guidance \nfrom The Association for Middle Level Education, has established Social/Emotional \nLearning Standards with these three goals: \nGoal 1: Develop self-awareness and self-management skills to achieve school \nand life success. \nGoal 2: Use social-awareness and interpersonal skills to establish and maintain \npositive relationships. \nGoal 3: Demonstrate decision-making skills and responsible behaviors in \npersonal, school, and community contexts. (Gordon, Ji, Mulhall, Shaw, & \nWeissberg, 2011, p. 73) \nThe stages of adolescent development, descriptions of ideal learning \nenvironments, and statements of learning goals are necessary for planning middle level \neducation, and teachers have the difficult job of translating these ideals into meaningful \nlearning opportunities for their specific students. In turn, students in minority \npopulations face unique and often little-understood obstacles to their success in the \nclassroom. One such population includes members of the LGBTQ community. These \nindividuals identify on the spectrum of sexual orientation and/or gender identity in areas \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 10 \nthat are considered different from heterosexuality. Unfortunately, information about \ngender and sexual minorities is generally absent from middle school curriculum. Only \n9.5% of middle school students reported any inclusion of the LGBTQ community in their \ntextbooks or assigned readings (Kosciw et al., 2014, p. 96). \nAs students enter puberty and their sexual attractions become more obvious to \nthemselves, many confront heteronormativity, the idea that heterosexuality is the only \nnormal and accepted sexual identity (Green & Peterson, 2006). Gender and sexual \nminority students in this environment often face discrimination and bullying. In fact, \naccording to the 2013 National School Climate Survey (2014), 30.3% of LGBTQ students \nwho took the survey admitted to missing one day of school in the previous month \nbecause of the fear of bullying and over 10% missed more than four days (Kosciw et al., \n2014, p. xvi). The American Psychological Association (2008) reports the following: \nThe widespread prejudice, discrimination, and violence to which lesbians and gay \nmen are often subjected are significant mental health concerns. Sexual prejudice, \nsexual orientation discrimination and antigay violence are major sources of stress \nfor lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Although social support is crucial in coping \nwith stress, antigay attitudes and discrimination may make it difficult for lesbian, \ngay and bisexual people to find such support. (pp. 2-3) \nStress is an important factor in a child's ability to engage with the learning \nprocess and succeed in school. Brown and Knowles (2007) reported on various studies \nrelated to stress and learning, concluding that \"Anxiety and stress affect the quality of \nstudents' cognitive processing, disrupting their ability to process information efficiently\" \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT \n(p. 93). Just the Facts about Sexual Orientation and Youth (Just the Facts Coalition, \n2008), a pamphlet produced by psychological and education organizations, concurred: \n1 1  \nOne result of the isolation and lack of support experienced by some lesbian, \ngay, and bisexual youth is higher rates of emotional distress, suicide attempts, \nand risky sexual behavior and substance use. Because their legitimate fear of \nbeing harassed or hurt may reduce the willingness of lesbian, gay, and \nbisexual youths to ask for help, it is important that their school environments \nbe open and accepting so these young people will feel comfortable sharing \ntheir thoughts and concerns, including the option of disclosing their sexual \norientation to others. Such disclosure is an expression of a normal tendency \nto want to share personal information about oneself with important others and \nshould be respected as such. (p. 4) \nThe Cass ( 1979) model of homosexual identity formation is a helpful roadmap for \ngay and lesbian individuals. Understanding these stages might help educators nurture \nstudents toward a healthy self-concept. The first stage is Identity Confusion where the \nstudent considers the question, \"Could I be gay?\" and struggles with accepting, denying \nor rejecting that idea. This is a stage of potential inner turmoil. The second stage is \nIdentity Comparison. The student considers the possibility of being gay or lesbian and \nwhat that means for the future. Here they might deal with fear, grief and social \nalienation. The third stage is Identity Tolerance where the student begins to believe he or \nshe is probably gay or lesbian and seeks to find others. Stage Four is Identity Acceptance \nwhere the person begins to have a positive view of his or her sexual orientation and might \nchoose to share this information with a select few. The fifth stage is Identity Pride in \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT \nwhich the student publically identifies with the LGBTQ community and creates \nseparation from the heterosexual community. The last stage is Identity Synthesis when \nsexual identity becomes just one part of a complex sense of self. \n12 \nTeachers who want to help their gender and sexual minority students navigate the \ncomplexities of adolescence and encourage a healthy identity find little, if any, \nacknowledgement of their existence in the curriculum (Kosciw et al., 2014, p. 96). One \nway to deal with the silence on this topic is to provide teachers with resources that allow \nthem to incorporate non-textbook publications into their advisory classes, English classes, \nand social studies classes. The most useful resources will help the teacher not only meet \nthe social and emotional needs of students but also meet the requirements of the Common \nCore State Standards, resources that are of high quality, promote critical thinking and \ngive opportunities for analysis (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices \n& Council of Chief State School Officers [NGA Center & CCSSO], 2010). \nCurricular Inclusion of Gender and Sexual Minorities \nIn light of the fact that gender and sexual minorities are underrepresented in \nmiddle school curriculum readings (Kosciw et al. , 2014, p. xix) and teachers need high \nquality, appropriate books for their students, this research analyzed the content of middle \nlevel trade books with LGBTQ content. The authoritative work on this topic is The Heart \nHas Its Reasons, Young Adult Literature with Gay/Lesbian/Queer Content, 1969-2004 by \nMichael Cart and Christine A. Jenkins (2006). Referencing Jenkins's (1998) content \nanalysis, they described the portrayals of LGBTQ characters as homosexual visibility, gay \nassimilation, and queer consciousness/community. Labeling a narrative as homosexual \nvisibility denoted a coming-out story where the character struggles with if, when, or how, \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 13 \nto tell others. In these stories, issues related to homosexuality are considered problems to \nbe solved and drive the storyline (Cart & Jenkins, 2006, p. 134). The gay assimilation \ncategory meant the sexual orientation of the queer character was not a factor in the story \n(Cart & Jenkins, 2006, p. 143). Queer consciousness/community represented the \ninclusion of affirming friends and family and a place to belong (Cart & Jenkins, 2006, p. \n146). Jenkins also noted if the character was lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender and if \nthe narrative role was primary or secondary. \nA recent study identified high quality literature with LGBTQ content and offered \nrationale for use in the classroom (Logan, Lasswell, Hood, & Watson, 2014). The \nauthors cited the concept of windows and mirrors, an analogy used to describe how \nliterature allows the reader to see himself (the mirror) while providing information for the \noutsider, or a window into the lives of others (Logan et al., p. 33). This is an important \nconsideration for combating homophobic bullying. Several researchers have found that \nthe development of affective empathy decreases the occurrence of bullying (Dodaj, Sesar, \nBarisic, & Pandza, 2013), and through the window of literature, heterosexuals can gain \nan understanding of and appreciation for members of gender and sexual minorities. \nStudents who realize they do not fit into the heteronormative paradigm can benefit from \nthis self-affirming opportunity to see themselves in literary characters who have the same \nstruggles and questions about life as they do. The same is true for works of nonfiction. \nBiographies, memoirs and essays that highlight contributions made by members of the \nLGBTQ community will combat stereotypes and provide role models for minority \nstudents. \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 14 \nSince 2008, The American Library Association has published a yearly Rainbow \nList of the best books with LGBTQ content for readers under the age of eighteen (Gay \nLesbian Bisexual Transgender Round Table, 2014). The lists are created by the Gay, \nLesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Round Table with the goal of honoring high quality \nbooks with authentic voices. Considering the fact that the American Library Association \nis a highly reputable and influential organization that recommends books to librarians, \nteachers and parents, the Rainbow Lists can be considered the authority on the best \nLGBTQ books published for middle level readers in a given year. To the best of my \nknowledge, the Rainbow Lists have never been used as a data pool for content analysis \nand will serve as an excellent source for researching high quality books that are available \nto middle school readers. \nWith a desire to create a resource for teachers that enables them to make informed \nchoices about books with gender and sexual minorities, I focused on these basic research \nquestions: \n• How are members of the LGBTQ community portrayed in middle level \nbooks deemed exceptional by the American Library Association? \n• How much profanity and sexuality are found in these books? \nMy second research question presupposes that a teacher will have difficulty \nrationalizing a book choice that has a high level of profanity and sexual content and \nwould therefore benefit from knowing which books have the potential to create the most \nobjections. \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 15 \nMethods \nThis research followed qualitative content analysis research methodology (Kline, \n2008 ; Krippendorff, 2013; Maxwell, 2010). Data pool and sample were the first step. \nThe books chosen for this content analysis were taken from The American Library \nAssociation's 2013 and 2014 Rainbow Lists. I read any book that was designated for \ngrades four through eight at their low range and added any Top Ten books that were \nintended for ninth grade and up. This provided a broad sample for low as well as higher \nlevel readers. I also added three books that did not make the Top Ten but were Stonewall \nAward winners and were intended for ninth grade and up (Adams, 2011; Charlton­\nTrujillo, 2013; Moskowitz, 2012). In total, 47 books fit my criteria. Thirty-one books \nwere in the fourth-eighth grade category, and 16 were for ninth grade and up. Four were \nnonfiction, and 43 were fiction. This was my data sample. \nOpen coding, or close scrutiny to identify patterns, was the second step in my \nresearch. As I read the books in my data pool, I looked for patterns in the demography of \nthe LGBTQ representatives (gender identity and sexual orientation), as well as Cass \n( 1979) stages of homosexual identity, and Jenkins' ( 1998) categories of narrative \nrepresentation. I was also interested in identifying content that could aid the teacher in \nanticipating community complaints. If a district encouraged teaching about gender and \nsexual minorities, I reasoned that the next area of concern would probably relate to \nprofanity and sexual content. I also categorized books according to the American Library \nAssociation recommended grade level as published in the Rainbow Lists, the ATOS book \nlevel (Renaissance Learning, 2014 ), and the Lexile level. The ATOS book level \nmeasures text complexity and correlates with Accelerated Reader, a popular reading \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 16 \nincentive program in middle schools. Even if a teacher is not using Accelerated Reader \nin the classroom, the ATOS book levels help match readers to appropriate texts \n(Renaissance Learning, 2014, p. 4). Lexile levels also measure text complexity and are \npart of the expectations of the Common Core State Standards for English language arts \n(NGA Center & CCSSO, 2010, appendix A, p. 8). \nAs I read each book in my data pool, I completed a chart with the above \ncategories. I also took note of the plot and any interesting anomalies. After the first \nread-through, I considered my initial findings and emergent patterns to create a research \ninstrument that compiled the relevant information. I then reread the books to fully \ncomplete the chart. This was done to empirically determine the presence or absence of \npreviously established patterns. This research conforms to best practice qualitative \ncontent analysis research methodology (Kline, 2008; Krippendorff, 2013; Maxwell, \n2010). \nDefinitions \nDuring the axial reading of each book, I took note of specific words and situations \nthat relate to profanity, sexuality, and bullying. Because these are broad terms with a \nwide range of definition, I have explained below exactly what I noted and why. \nProfanity. In the tabulation of profanity in the reviewed books, I followed the \nframework of Coyne, Callister, Stockdale, Nelson, and Wells (2012) for the purpose of \nproviding teachers information in choosing books appropriate for the student in a \nparticular environment. Coyne et al. (2012) studied profanity in adolescent literature, \ncoding for various categories of words. I chose to use several of their categories, \nincluding \"seven dirty words,\" based on Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 17 \n(shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits) by George Carlin. This was a \ncomedy routine that garnered outrage in 1973 and led to a Supreme Court case that \ndeclared the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had the right to limit \nindecency in broadcasting. The words are still considered socially unacceptable in most \nparts of the United States (Bella, 2012). I also followed Coyne et al. (2012) in coding for \n\"mild other words\" (e.g., ass, damn) and \"strong other words\" (e.g., bastard, bitch). I \nalso included homophobic slurs (e.g., fag, faggot, homo, dyke) that were given as \nexamples in the 2013 National School Climate Survey: The Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, \nBisexual and Transgender Youth in our Nation 's Schools (Kosciw et al., 2014, p. 16). \nEach occurrence of a word from the above categories was recorded, tallied, and \ncompared to the number of pages in the book. This allowed for the production of a ratio \nof potentially offensive words to number of pages, a quick way to determine how \nprevalent profanity and homophobic slurs were in a given book. \nSexual Content. In the coding of sexual content I followed the framework of \nCallister et al. (2012) for the purpose of providing teachers more information about \nappropriate material for their middle level readers. I chose to use their categories labeled \n\"talk about sex,\" \"passionate kissing,\" \"intimate touching,\" \"implicit sexual intercourse\" \nand \"explicit sexual intercourse\" (p. 482). According to Callister et al. (2012), an \nexample of intimate touching is caressing for the purpose of sexual stimulation (p. 480). \nImplicit sexual intercourse included descriptions that hinted that sexual intercourse \noccurred but were not overtly described. Explicit sexual intercourse graphically \ndescribed the activity. Callister et al. (2012) coded several more nuanced elements of \nsexual activity than I used in this study. The categories I chose were broad for the sake \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT \nof simplicity and for the purpose of alerting the teacher to its presence instead of its \nfrequency. \nBullying. In the coding of bullying, I followed the framework of Kosciw et al. \n(2014) in the 2013 National School Climate Survey. They described the categories of \nbullying as follows: \n• verbal harassment (e.g., being called names or threatened) \n• physical harassment (e.g. , shoved or pushed) \n• physical assault (e.g., punched, kicked, or injury from a weapon) \n18 \n• relational aggression (e.g. , being purposefully excluded by peers and being \nthe target of mean rumors or lies) \n• electronic harassment (e.g., text messages, emails, instant messages, or \npostings on Internet sites such as Facebook) (Kosciw et al., 2014, pp. \n22-24) \nOccurrences of bullying give the teacher means to discuss the topic with students and \nallow the reader to either identify with or develop empathy for the victims. Not every \ninstance of bullying was coded, but its presence was noted. \nThis project has its weaknesses. For example, I did not read these books as part \nof a team of colleagues, and as a result, the observations and conclusions are limited by \nmy personal abilities. In addition, I studied a select group of books chosen by a \ncommittee and not the entirety of those published in a given time period. Some may \nargue that I bring a heteronormative bias because I am not part of the LGBTQ \ncommunity; however, I do have a lesbian daughter. As with any researcher, I bring a \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT \nhistory and a perspective to my inquiry, and to the best of my ability, strive to maintain \nobjectivity. \nFindings \nI employed the content analysis tool as I read 47 books with gender and sexual \nminority content. Particular categories of information, as previously discussed, were \nrecorded and subsequent analysis revealed patterns across the categories. Finally, I \ndiscussed the significance of the findings as they relate to middle level readers. \nGenre \n19 \nThe majority of reviewed books were fiction (n = 43; 92%). Within fiction, \nsubgenres were noted and tabulated. The most prevalent subgenre was realistic fiction (n \n= 24; 51 % ). Four books (9%) were coded as dystopian fiction because they took place in \na future world that was the result of the destruction of our present world. Three books \nwere coded as fantasy (6%) because they took place in worlds where the supernatural and \nmystical were part of life. Two books ( 4%) were coded as magical realism because \nsupernatural elements contributed to an otherwise realistic story. Two books were works \nof poetry (4%), one narrative was science fiction (2%), and seven (15%) were graphic \nnovels .  Only four books were nonfiction (9% ). These included two memoirs (Coyote, \n2012; Moon& Lecesne, 2012), one history (Setterington, 2013), and an adult-themed \ngender workbook (Bornstein, 2013). See Appendix B for the genre of each reviewed \nbook. \nThe Common Core State Standards (NGA Center & CCSSO, 2010) aim to \nincrease the reading of nonfiction texts to 50% of a student's reading load in sixth grade, \nincreasing it to 55% by eighth grade (p. 5). Among these highly-rated books with \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 20 \nLGBTQ content, only four could be considered nonfiction, and only one, Branded by the \nPink Triangle, was related to history (Setterington, 2013). The two memoires were \npersonal reflections of growing up as members of the LGBTQ community. The fourth \nnonfiction book, My New Gender Workbook: A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving World \nPeace through Gender Anarchy and Sex Positivity (Bornstein, 2013) might be useful \nbackground information for the teacher with only some elements appropriate for \nclassroom use. Overall, the nonfiction section of this data pool was not representative of \nwhat teachers need in their classrooms today. \nReading Levels \nLexile measures employ a quantitative method to describe text complexity. In \ntheory, the lower the Lexile measure, the easier the text. Of the 47 reviewed books, \nLexile measures were not available for sixteen (34% ). According Common Core \nexpectations, independent readers (second graders) should be able to read texts in the \nLexile range of 450L-790L. Two books fell below this range. The book with the lowest \nLexile level (HL380L) was Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe \n(Saenz, 2012). This book is designated HL (high/low) because it has a low Lexile \nmeasure with subject matter more appropriate for higher grades. The only other book to \nfall below Common Core Lexile expectations was Drama (Telgemeier, 2012), a graphic \nnovel with a Lexile measure of GN400L. Nearly half (n = 22;  47%) of the reviewed \nbooks fell into second and third grade range of 450L-790L. Nine of the reviewed books \nmet the third and fourth grade Lexile range of 770L-980L. Only three books reached the \nsixth, seventh and eighth grade Lexile range of 955L-1155L. \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 2 1  \nAs teachers attempt to help their students meet Common Core expectations on \ntext complexity as defined by Lexile ranges, middle level educators will have little to \nchoose from in this data pool. Only three books fell in the Lexile range for grades six, \nseven and eight. They were Branded by the Pink Triangle (11 lOL) (Setterington, 2013), \nThe Difference Between You and Me (1020L) (George, 2012), and The Miseducation of \nCameron Post (l 120L) (Danforth, 2012). Branded by the Pink Triangle (Setterington, \n2013) is a history of Nazi persecution of gender and sexual minorities, and the other two \nare fiction with adolescent lesbian protagonists. Such a small sampling of books would \nhardly meet the needs of every middle school student. Even though Lexile ranges are \nspecifically cited as Common Core expectations (NGA Center & CCSSO, 2010, \nAppendix A, p. 8), other considerations, such as ATOS book levels and published grade \nlevel recommendations (available in Appendix C,  entitled Reading Levels) should be \nconsulted to gain a more complete view of a particular book and increase the choices \navailable to middle level teachers, students, and interested parents. \nIdentity \nIn the 47 reviewed books, 25 (53%) included male gay characters. Lesbian \ncharacters appeared in 19 books ( 40% ) . Five books ( 11 % ) contained bisexual characters, \n10 books (21 %) included transgender individuals and two (4%) portrayed intersex \npersons. One short story, \"Jelson,\" in OMG Queer (Radclyffe & Lynch, eds. , 2012) \nfeatured an asexual character. Among the books that told the story of only one gender \nidentity or sexual orientation, 14 (30%) featured only male gay characters, 13 (28%) \ndepicted only lesbians and six (13%) portrayed only transgender characters. See \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 22 \nAppendix D, entitled Character Representation, for the identities found in each reviewed \nbook. \nOne interesting aspect of this analysis was the number of books with trans gender \ncontent. The first young adult novel about a transgender character was Luna by Julie \nAnne Peters published in 2004 (Cart & Jenkins, 2010, p. 160). From 2005 to 2011, the \nyears leading up to this data pool, only eleven books with transgender characters were \nchosen for the American Library Association's yearly Rainbow Lists. In other words, \nfrom 2004 to 2011, only twelve books in eight years were considered high quality young \nadult books with transgender content (1.5 books per year). In the two years of this data \npool (Rainbow Lists 2013 and 2014), 10 books met this criteria (five books per year). \nOver time, it is likely that more texts with transgender content will be available for \nmiddle level classroom use. \nNarrative Role \nIn most of the 47 reviewed books, a gender or sexual minority character was \nplaced in the primary role of protagonist (n = 37 ; 79% ). Fourteen books (30%) had \nmembers of the LGBTQ community as both primary and secondary characters. Six \nbooks (13%) placed minority characters in secondary roles only. Appendix D, Character \nRepresentation, lists the narrative roles for each book in this data pool. \nThese results show progress in the historical place of gender and sexual minority \ncharacters in young adult literature. According to Cart and Jenkins (2006, appendix C), \nfrom 1969 to 2004, LGBTQ protagonists appeared in only 37% of young adult fiction \nwith queer content. This shift toward a greater number of gender and sexual minority \nprotagonists means readers will encounter more fully developed, sympathetic, multi-\nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 23 \ndimensional characters. If one reason to incorporate LGBTQ characters in the \ncurriculum is to provide opportunities for identification and empathy (Logan et al., p. 33), \nstories with minority protagonists could help teachers meet that goal. \nCharacter Portrayal \nCart and Jenkins (2006) identified three categories of LGBTQ character portrayal \nin young adult literature: visibility, assimilation, and community. Visibility denoted a \ncoming out story where a character's sexual orientation or gender identity was viewed as \na secret or a problem to solve. In this data pool, 23 books (49%) were primarily about \nvisibility or coming out. The second category, assimilation, described storylines in which \nthe sexual orientation or gender identity of the minority character was of little \nconsequence. Six books (13 % ) portrayed gender and sexual minorities as assimilated. \nThe third category was community where the minority characters had friends and/or \nfamily members who loved and accepted them. Twenty-three books (49%) portrayed \nLGBTQ characters in community. See Appendix D entitled Character Representation for \ninformation on portrayal in each reviewed book. \nCart and Jenkins (2006, Appendix C) reported that in young adult books with \nLGBTQ content published from 1969-2004 an overwhelming majority (85%) focused on \nhomosexual visibility (coming out) while only 16% included minority characters in \ncommunity. The fact that 49% of this data pool portrayed gender and sexual minorities \nin community shows how quickly the literary environment has changed for these \ncharacters. Books that treat sexual orientation or gender identity as something to hide \nand eventually reveal speak to students experiencing these issues themselves, and \ncoming-out stories help others understand the emotional turmoil these students face. \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 24 \nHowever, balancing this angst with narratives that portray love and acceptance for gender \nand sexual minority characters (community and assimilation) challenges stereotypes and \noffers hope that no matter how a person identifies, they can have a place to belong. \nCass (1979) Stages \nAs discussed previously, the Cass (1979) model of homosexual identity formation \noutlines steps toward self acceptance. Originally designed to describe gay men and \nwomen, I applied the categories to all gender and sexual minorities found in the 47 \nreviewed books. Nineteen books ( 40%) portrayed members of the LGBTQ community \nin various stages or moving through the stages which suggests that the characters in those \nbooks are most likely to be multidimentional and exhibit personal growth. The Cass \n(1979) stage most represented was Stage 6, Identity Synthesis, (n = 22; 47%) which is the \nlast stage of self acceptance. Similarly, 21 books ( 45%) included characters in Stage 4, \nIdentity Acceptance. The characters at this stage had some level of peace about their \ngender identity or sexual orientation and exhibited selective \"coming out.\" Fewer stories \nportrayed Stage 2, Identity Comparison (n = 7 ;  15%), Stage 3, Identity Tolerance (n = 6 ;  \n13%), and Stage 5 ,  Identity Pride (n = 6 ;  13%). One reason for this could be that Stage 2 \nand Stage 3 are not very interesting from a narrative point of view. In regard to Stage 5, \nIdentity Pride, I looked for evidence of a character devaluing heterosexuality, one of the \nhallmarks of this stage (Cass, 1979, p. 233), and that behavior was not prevalent. See \nAppendix D entitled Character Representation for the Cass ( 1979) Stages portrayed in \neach reviewed book. \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 25 \nTable 1 \nCass ( 1979) Stages Represented in Reviewed Books \nStage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4 Stage 5 Stage 6 Multi \nIdentity Identity Identity Identity Identity Identity Stages \nConfusion Comparison Tolerance Acceptance Pride Synthesis \nBooks 13 7 6 21 6 22 19 \nPercent 28% 15% 13% 45% 13% 47% 40% \nWhen students read stories that include people facing the same questions and \nfears they experience, they can identify, engage, and observe various ways to respond. \nFortunately, this data pool provides books that portray members of the LGBTQ \ncommunity in every Cass ( 1979) Stage, and a high percentage are moving forward and \nliving in Stage 6 where sexual orientation or gender identity is just one part of a \nmultifaceted personality. In Stage 6, characters have connected with others in healthy \nrelationships which might include marriage and parenting. These books can offer hope \nfor students who feel trapped or afraid, giving them a vision for the future and role \nmodels that lead the way. \nBullying \nThe most frequently noted type of bullying in this data pool was verbal \nharassment (n = 33; 70%), followed by relational aggression (n = 26; 55%) which is \nbeing shunned or slandered. Electronic harassment was low (n = 8 ;  17% ), perhaps due to \nthe wide variety of time periods portrayed. Electronic bullying is a factor beginning in \nthe early 21st Century, and many of the reviewed books take place in the past or in a \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 26 \nworld without communication devices. Ten books (21 % ) were free of bullying. See \nAppendix E for the bullying content in each reviewed book. \nTable 2 \nPresence of Bullying in Reviewed Books \nVerbal Physical Physical Relational Electronic None \nHarassment Harassment Assault Aggression Harassment \nBooks 33 16 16 26 8 10 \nPercentage 70% 34% 34% 55% 17% 21% \nAnti-bullying efforts are common in middle school, and each book in this data \npool offers examples and material for discussion. Even the ten books without bullying \ncontent could be used to discuss why the characters were not bullied and how that \naffected their lives. Verbal harassment and relational aggression are the most common \ntypes of bullying reported by LGBTQ students in The 2013 National School Climate \nSurvey (Kosciw et al., 2014, pp. 22, 24), and this data pool gives ample examples of both. \nChallenging Content \nAccording to the Office for Intellectual Freedom and the Public Information \nOffice (2014), when a book is challenged for removal from a school, parents are by far \nthe number one source of those requests. The most common reasons for removal are \nsexually explicit content first and objectionable language second. The following findings \ncan alert the teacher to potential challenges from parents. \nProfanity. Objectionable words, as defined previously, were counted in each \nreviewed book. The total was then divided by the number of pages in the book to yield a \nquotient less than one. The smaller the result, the smaller the percentage of profanity was \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 27 \nfound in the narrative. Six books of the 47 reviewed were found to have no objectionable \nlanguage. Twenty-one books fell in the range of .004 to .1 .  In other words, 57% (n = 27) \nof the books in this data pool were relatively low in profanity. Nine books fell in the \nrange of .11 to .2, and nine books were .21 or higher. Gone, Gone, Gone (Moskowitz, \n2012) had the highest profanity quotient of .861. \nAs teachers plan lessons with books in this data pool, Appendix F, Profanity and \nSexual Content, provides a way to gauge which books might cause fewer complaints. It \nalso gives quantitative information to share with parents. Other factors such as the \nimportance of the narrative relative to the curriculum could also bolster a book's \nacceptability. \nSexual content. Of the 4 7 reviewed books, 19 ( 40%) contained no sexual content \nas previously defined. The type of sexual content most frequently noted was passionate \nkissing (n = 19; 40%) and intimate touch (n = 19; 40% ). Explicit descriptions of \nintercourse were found in seven books (15%) and implicit intercourse appeared in 14 \nbooks (30% ). \nTable 3 \nPresence of Sexual Content in Reviewed Books \nTalk Passionate Intimate Implicit Explicit \nabout Kissing Touch Intercourse Intercourse \nSex None \nBooks 17 19 19 14 7 19 \nPercentage 36% 40% 40% 30% 15% 40% \nSexually explicit content is the most common reason for challenging a book \n(Office for Intellectual Freedom & Public Information Office, 2014). Fortunately, 19 \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 28 \nbooks in this data pool are free of this type of content. See Appendix F entitled Profanity \nand Sexual Content for the sexual content present in each reviewed book. It is interesting \nto note that one of the most banned books of 2014 was Drama (Telgemeier, 2013) \nbecause of \"sexually explicit content\" (American Library Association, 2013), yet was \ncoded for zero sexual content in this research because the kissing and touching were not \npassionate or intimate. Even with the best preparation and forethought, any book in this \ndata pool could be challenged due to the presence of gender and sexual minorities. \nDiscussion \nThe 47 books reviewed in this research offer high quality narratives with gender \nand sexual minority content for middle level readers. The analysis of genre, reading \nlevels, characterizations, and bullying aids the teacher in choosing books to meet \ncurricular objectives. Advanced notice about the profanity and sexual content in a book \nmight help avoid challenges from community members. Complete information for each \nreviewed book is found in the appendices. \nReading levels (Appendix C) are useful for matching readers with appropriate \ntexts. For independent reading or literature circles, each student could choose a book \nwith a gender or sexual minority character at their individual ATOS or Lexile level . \nStruggling readers are likely to do well with graphic novels like the Kevin Keller series \n(Parent, 2012) and Avengers: The Children 's Crusade (Heinberg, 2012), and Drama \n(Telgemeier, 2012). If Accelerated Reader is used as a reading incentive program, any \nbook in this data pool with an ATOS level (Appendix C) could be read for points. If a \nbook in Appendix C does not have an ATOS level at the time of this writing, it might be \nadded to AR BookFinder (Renaissance Leaming, 2014), a website that reports reading \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 29 \nlevels for any book in its system. Even though books in this data pool have appropriate \nreading levels for middle school students, the content might be more mature than \nexpected. Cross referencing a book with its profanity and sexual content (Appendix F) \nwill give more information about its suitability. \nLanguage Arts teachers will find narratives in this research that can serve the dual \npurpose of including gender and sexual minorities in various literary forms. Freak Boy \n(Clark, 2013), the story of two transgender individuals, is book-length verse, and the \nformat of the poetry is continually changing. For example, an entry about Christmas is in \nthe shape of a Christmas tree. October Mourning: A Song for Matthew Shepard \n(Newman, 2012) is also written in verse with a glossary of poetic forms in back. The \nSong of Achilles (Miller, 2012) and Love in the Time of Global Warming (Block, 2013) \nare both retellings of Homer. The first reinterprets the relationship between Achilles and \nPatroclus and the second takes place in a dystopian future with characters continually \nreferring to Homer. Short stories and essays could be explored in One in Every Crowd \n(Coyote, 2012), OMG Queer: Short Stories by Queer Youth (Radclyffe & Lynch, eds., \n2012), and The Letter Q: Queer Writers ' Notes to their Younger Selves (Moon & \nLecesne, 2012) . \nSchool counselors and advisory teachers might find books related to the Cass \n(1979) Stages useful for their students (see Appendix D). Better Nate than Ever (Federle, \n2013) is an example of an eighth grade boy in Stage 1 who begins to wonder, \"Am I \ngay?\" It is a lighthearted story, told by Nate, giving his spin on being bullied and loving \nBroadway shows. Archenemies (Hoblin, 2013) is the story of Addie, a high school junior \nwho has faced prejudice but is fully accepted at home. When Addie misinterprets Eva's \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT \naffection, Eva over reacts and becomes her \"archenemy.\" Addie represents a person in \nStage 6 (Identity Synthesis or full acceptance), while Eva represents Stage 1 (Identity \nConfusion). \n30 \nOn the topic of bullying, Appendix E charts the type of bullying found in each \nreviewed book. To focus on cyber bullying, for example, the category \"electronic \nharassment\" highlights which books include that form of bullying. Multiple types of \nharassment were apparent in Tess Masterson will go to Prom (Franklin, 2012), a story \nthat explores homophobia in a small Midwestern town. Tess and her family's grocery \nstore are targeted by community rallies and the media when she plans to go to prom with \na girl, and fellow students torment her at school. \nSeveral books in this data pool could be useful to social studies teachers. For \nexample, the issue of marriage equality was an important part of My Mixed Up Berry \nBlue Summer, (Gennarum, 2012). June is 12 years old and her mom plans to marry her \ngirlfriend. People in the town boycott their shop, display anti-gay marriage signs, and \ndistribute flyers. June does her own research at the library and learns that she has nothing \nto be ashamed of. In the study of World War II and the Holocaust, Branded by the Pink \nTriangle (Setterington, 2013) discusses pre-war attitudes toward members of the LGBTQ \ncommunity, then the imprisonment and execution of gender and sexual minorities, \nfollowed by their treatment after the war. Branded by the Pink Triangle (Setterington, \n2013) includes primary source photographs, political cartoons, and firsthand accounts, as \nwell as charts, maps, and timelines, useful for developing content area reading skills. In \nthe study of non-Western cultures, If You Could be Mine (Farizan, 2013) takes place in \nmodern day Iran. Nasrin and Sahar are childhood friends who are in love with each \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 3 1  \nother, but being gay is punishable by death. Being transgender, however, is acceptable, \nso Nasrin considers having an operation to make her legally male so she can marry Sahar. \nMany of the books in this data pool can be integrated into the curriculum. \nWhether it is a simple suggestion for free reading or a whole-class detailed analysis, \nbooks with LGBTQ content can serve multiple purposes. High quality books at the right \nLexile level can help students meet national and state standards. They can also provide \ncomfort and guidance for students concerned about their own gender identity or sexual \norientation while at the same time encouraging empathy in those who might be prone to \nbullying. I hope the information compiled here will be used as a tool for teachers and \nparents to find the right books for their students. \nConclusion \nEqual rights and protections for gender and sexual minorities are likely to increase \nin the coming years. As a result, teachers will need resources to reflect that reality in the \nclassroom. National organizations like GLSEN (GLSEN, Inc., 2016) offer education and \nprofessional development. The GSA Network (GSA Network , 2009) provides \nmentoring and resources for students to combat homophobia and trans phobia. The FAIR \nEducation Act (Our Family Coalition, n.d.) is a website dedicated to social studies lesson \nplans that include gender and sexual minorities as well as persons with disabilities. For \nthose who wish to develop their knowledge base and contribute toward a safer, more \nsuccessful school environment for LGBTQ indentifying students, practical help and \nresources are available. \nIn regard to future research, I believe similar content analyses focused on \nnonfiction books about gender and sexual minorities would be useful. Currently, few \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 32 \nhigh quality biographies, memoirs and topical texts exist for middle level readers, as \nreflected in this research, but over time, perhaps in response to the expectations of \nnational and state standards, more will be published. Another avenue of interest would \nbe the analysis of picture books and texts for younger readers that have LGBTQ content. \nThe inclusion of gender and sexual minorities in curricula is a new field of research and \nan important addition to our body of knowledge. \nANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT \nReferences \nAmerican Psychological Association.

    "abstract": "Middle school is often the time students become aware of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and in many schools, perceived nonheteronormative behavior is penalized through bullying. One way schools can reduce bullying and increase successful learning environments is to include trade books that feature gender and sexual minorities. State and national standards set expectations for social and emotional learning as well as critical analysis of high quality reading materials. This research analyzed trade books from the 2013 and 2014 Rainbow Lists which were chosen by the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Round Table of the American Library Association as the best books published with LGBTQ content the previous year for readers under the age of 18. Forty-seven books at the fourth through ninth grade levels were coded for genre, character identity, role, portrayal, reading levels, Cass (1979) Stages, bullying events, profanity, and sexual content. Profanity and sexual content were coded to anticipate community objections. Suggestions for the use of specific books in classroom situations are discussed",
