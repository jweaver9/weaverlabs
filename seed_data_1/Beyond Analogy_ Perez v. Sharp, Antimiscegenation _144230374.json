This article is for H, the \"person of mychoice.\"CALIFORNIA LA W REVIEWcommunity frequently assert that dispatching Perez in these cases distorts themeaning of that decision and other similar precedents by drawing a falseanalogy between bans on interracial and same-sex marriage. ProfessorLenhardt argues that, instead, Perez's appearance in recent cases helps toclarify the nature of the marriage rights at stake in Loving v. Virginia. She alsocontends that the strategic use of Perez serves to underscore the extent to whichstate antimiscegenation laws established not only racial, but also gender-basedidentity norms.Finally, Professor Lenhardt asserts that Perez's use in recent marriagecases offers a way out of the \"analogy\" debate, focusing discussion on thenature and substantive effect of race and gender bars on marriage, rather thanon a comparison of the groups seeking judicial redress for such restrictions.Professor Lenhardt concludes that a deeper appreciation of the extent to whichstate-imposed obstacles to marriage have operated to police identity, restrictopportunities for self-definition, and impede belonging can elucidate the trueimplications and citizenship effects of prohibitions on marriage for same-sexcouples.INTRODUCTION 1[T]here is no redress for the serious restriction of the right of Negroes,Mulattoes, Mongolians, and Malays to marry.... A member of any ofthese races may find himself barred from marrying the person of hischoice and that person to him may be irreplaceable. Human beings arebereft of worth and dignity by a doctrine that would make them asinterchangeable as trains.2Justice Roger J. Traynor, Perez v. SharpSixty-five years ago, two California factory workers, Sylvester Davis andAndrea P&rez, committed an act that would transform the terrain of race andethnicity in the United States. They fell in love.3 Determined to share the rest of1. This article draws on portions of the author's book chapter, R.A. Lenhardt, The Story ofPerez v.

Perez is sometime referred to as Perez v.Moroney or Perez v. Lippold, the last title being the one used in the Pacific Law Reporter.Changes in the management of the Los Angeles County Clerk's office account for the shifts. Theclerk's office was run by W.G. Sharp when the California Supreme Court issued its decision inPerez. See Peggy Pascoe, Miscegenation Law, Court Cases, and Ideologies of \"Race\" inTwentieth-Century America, 83 J. AM. HIST. 44, 61 n.42 (1996) [hereinafter Pascoe,Miscegenation Law].3. In an excellent article that draws on oral histories from persons associated with Perez,198 P. 2d 17, Dara Orenstein movingly tells the story of Sylvester and Andrea's romance,providing valuable insights into their personal histories, the decisions that led them to challengeCalifornia law, and the race-related implications of the decision rendered in the case. See DaraOrenstein, Void for Vagueness: Mexicans and the Collapse of Miscegenation Law in California,74 PAC. HIST. REV. 367 (2005); see also R.A. Lenhardt, The Story of Perez v.

The county clerk, however, refused to grant them one. Sylvester andAndrea had run afoul of California's antimiscegenation law.8On its face, this antimiscegenation law, which had been in effect fromCalifornia's entry into the union in 1850, 9 did not appear to apply to Sylvesterand Andrea. It declared that \"marriages of white persons with negroes,Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes\" would be deemedillegal and void.10 Individuals of Mexican descent were nowhere mentioned inthe statute. But, in California, Mexican Americans had long been regarded aswhite for purposes of marriage.\" Andrea was a mestizo who, by all accounts,did not appear phenotypically white12 and who, given the racial politics ofMoran, eds., 2007) [hereinafter Lenhardt, The Story ofPerez v. Sharp] (discussing non-recognitionof Perez and its implications in the race context). Surprisingly few legal scholars have studiedPerez in any depth. Exceptions include RACHEL F. MORAN, INTERRACIAL INTIMACY: THEREGULATION OF RACE AND ROMANCE 85-88 (2001); RANDALL KENNEDY, INTERRACIALINTIMACIES: SEX, MARRIAGE, IDENTITY, AND ADOPTION 259-66, 269 (2003); Kevin R. Johnson &Kristina L. Burrows, Struck by Lightning? Interracial Intimacy and Racial Justice, 25 HUM. RTS.Q. 528 (2003) (reviewing MORAN, supra). Outside of legal academia, I am aware of only a fewscholars besides Orenstein who have focused on Perez. See PETER WALLENSTEIN, TELL THECOURT I LOVE MY WIFE: RACE, MARRIAGE, AND LAW - AN AMERICAN HISTORY 192-99 (2002);Pascoe, Miscegenation Law, supra note 1, at 61; Fay Botham, \"Almighty God Created the Races\":Theologies of Marriage and Race in Anti-Miscegenation Cases, 1865-1967, at 25 (2005)(unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Claremont Graduate University) (on file with author); MarkRobert Brilliant, Color Lines: Civil Rights Struggles on America's \"Racial Frontier,\" 1945-1975(Aug. 2002) (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Stanford University) (on file with author).4. Orenstein, supra note 3, at 372, 374.5. Id. at 372-73. Not insignificantly, it was unusual for African Americans and Latinos tomarry in the California of the 1940s, which was marked by racial segregation. Id. at 374. Indeed,Andrea and Sylvester might never have met had World War 11 not occurred. The pressures ofhaving to fulfill the production needs of wartime led companies that had previously declined tohire women and racial minorities to open their doors to these groups. See JOSH SIDES, L.A. CITYLIMITS: AFRICAN AMERICAN Los ANGELES FROM THE GREAT DEPRESSION TO THE PRESENT 36(2005). Lockheed Aviation, which by 1942 employed both Andrea and Sylvester, was amongthese companies. Orenstein, supra note 3, at 372 n.10. When the company loosened its hiringpolicies in the early to mid 1940s, it made it possible for Sylvester and Andrea to meet. See id.372 n.10.6. Id. at 368.7. Id.8. Id.9. Id. at 375.10. CAL. CIv.

This whiteness designation has its roots in the Treaty ofGuadalupe Hidalgo, which extended American citizenship to Mexican nationals in ending the warbetween the United States and Mexico. See George A. Martinez, Constructing Latcrit Theory:Diversity, Commonality, and Identity, 33 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. 787, 788 (2000). Significantly,Mexican Americans had been deemed non-white for many other purposes. See IAN F. HANEYL6PEZ, RACISM ON TRIAL: THE CHICANO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE 81, 83-87 (2003).12. Orenstein, supra note 3, at 403 (reporting that a brief article in TIME referred to Andrea2008]CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEWCalifornia at the time, likely received none of the social privileges associatedwith whiteness.1 3 Ironically, though, she was deemed to fall among thosewhose blood had to be protected from contamination by non-Whites. 14Devout Catholics interested in marrying in their neighborhood church,'5Sylvester and Andrea refused to resort to the strategies employed by othercouples ensnared in the bramble bush of California's race regulations. 16 Theywere unwilling to cohabitate,' 7 misrepresent their racial identity,' 8 or even toas \"olive-skinned\"). When discussing the Perez case in which he participated years later, SylvesterDavis is said to have reflected on Andrea's categorization as white, saying \"That's horse manure,that she was white.\" Id. at 394. A picture of Andrea from 1982 appears in an online journal article.See David A. Hollinger, Amalgamation and Hypodescent: The Question of Ethnoracial Mixture inthe History of the United States, 108 AM. HiST. REV. 5 (2003), available athttp://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/ 08.5/hollinger.html.13. See Lenhardt, The Story ofPerez v. Sharp, supra note 3, at 345, 359. In California atthis time, Latinos often faced discrimination and were frequently barred from enjoying publicfacilities and spaces with whites. See SIDES, supra note 5, at 16-18, 48-49; Kevin R. Johnson,Hernandez v. Texas: Legacies of Justice and Injustice, 25 CHICANO-LATINO L. REV. 153, 174(2005). Mexican American children, for example, were frequently forced to attend raciallysegregated public schools. See Westminster Sch. Dist. v. Mendez, 161 F.2d 774 (9th Cir. 1947)(invalidating the policy of segregating Mexican children from white children in public schools).14. The contamination of white blood was a concern in race cases from early on, butbecame a preoccupation with the rise of the eugenics movement. See Julie Novkov, RacialConstructions: The Legal Regulation of Miscegenation in Alabama, 1890-1934, 20 LAW & HIST.REV. 225, 275 (2002).15.

Orenstein, supra note 3, at 386.17. California's law prohibited only interracial marriage. It did not seek to proscribeinterracial sex, as states such as Florida did in adopting prohibitions on interracial cohabitation.See McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184 (1964).18. Attempts to \"pass\" or misrepresent identity were a common response by those seekingto circumvent antimiscegenation laws. See, e.g., MORAN, supra note 3, at 43-48 (discussingpassing and efforts to circumvent antimiscegenation laws); Orenstein, supra note 3, at 386-87(discussing county clerk-sanctioned efforts by Mexican women \"suitably dark in complexion\" topass as non-white under California's antimiscegenation law, as well as the willingness on the partof a judge to bend racial categories in order to permit an interracial couple to marry underCalifornia law). For additional information on passing and other forms of identity manipulation,see R.A. Lenhardt, Understanding the Mark: Race Stigma, and Equality in Context, 79 N.Y.U. L.REV. 803, n.211 (2004) [hereinafter Lenhardt, Understanding the Mark] (discussing passing andother forms of identity manipulation). For scholarship addressing the manipulation of racialidentity in particular, see, for example, ERVING GOFFMAN, STIGMA: NOTES ON THE MANAGEMENTOF SPOILED IDENTITY 44 (1963); Devon W. Carbado & Mitu Gulati, The Law and Economics ofCritical Race Theory, 112 YALE L.J. 1757, 1811-12 (discussing efforts of racial minorities to fitinto workplace environment by accepting dominant cultural norms); see also SHIRLEE TAYLORHAIZLIP, THE SWEETER THE JUICE: A FAMILY MEMOIR IN BLACK AND WHITE (1995) (detailing,inter alia, story of black family in which certain members decided to pass and live as Whites,while others continued to live as part of the African American community); JAMES WELDONJOHNSON, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF AN Ex-COLOURED MAN (1961) (detailing efforts of AfricanAmericans to pass); NELLA LARSEN, QUICKSAND AND PASSING (Deborah E.

For discussions of the similarities in passing strategies employed byracial minorities and gay men and lesbians, see, for example, Angela Onwuachi-Willig,[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYseek a marriage license in a sister-state without an antimiscegenation law, asmany others did. 19 They sought legal marriage on the same terms available toall Californians. And so, with the help of a civil rights attorney named Dan20Marshall, they resolved to challenge California's antimiscegenation law.This decision was significant, but not monumental in and of itself.Litigants had made various challenges to the application of antimiscegenationlaws over the years./l Relatively few, however, had sought to challenge theentire antimiscegenation apparatus. Andrea and Sylvester undertook this22challenge and won.On October 1, 1948, the California Supreme Court issued an opinionholding the state's antimiscegenation law unconstitutional under the FourteenthAmendment of the U.S. Constitution. 23 Its ground-breaking decision, whichmarked the first time since Reconstruction that any antimiscegenation statute24had been invalidated, led to significant changes in the lives of interracialUndercover Other, 94 CALIF. L. REV. 873 (2006); Sharon Elizabeth Rush, Equal ProtectionAnalogies - Identity and \"Passing\": Race and Sexual Orientation, 13 HARV. BLACKLETrER L.J.65 (1997).19. Some jurisdictions prohibited couples from crossing state lines to marry. See Loving v.Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 2 (1967) (noting that the Lovings left Virginia and went to the neighboringDistrict of Columbia, where interracial marriage was permissible). California, however, was notone of them. In fact, the California Supreme Court determined as early as 1875 that it wouldrecognize the validity of interracial marriages procured in other jurisdictions. See Pearson v.Pearson, 51 Cal. 120, 125 (1875) (holding that a marriage \"valid by the law of the place where itwas contracted, is also valid in this State\").20. Marshall was a white Catholic with broad experience in litigating civil rights cases. SeeOrenstein, supra note 3, at 388-89.21. Significantly, these challenges took a variety of forms and arose in cases concerning,inter alia, divorce, annulments, intestacy, and conflict of laws issues, as well as civil marriagerights. See, e.g., KENNEDY, supra note 3, at 232-41. Where they did not attempt to contest theoverall constitutionality of interracial marriage prohibitions, such challenges typically took twoforms. Most often, they involved attempts to prove or disprove an individual's membership in oneof the racial groups precluded from intermarrying with Whites. See Pascoe, Miscegenation Law,supra note 2, at 44-45. In other instances, litigants endeavored to show that the racial or ethnicgroup of which they were a part was not among those barred from entering into marriages withwhite individuals. Roldan v. Los Angeles County, 18 P.2d 706 (1933), which Leti Volpp exploredin her article, American Mestizo: Filipinos and Antimiscegenation Laws in California, 33 U.C.DAVis L. REV. 795 (2000) [hereinafter Volpp, American Mestizo], provides a notable examplehere. In that case, Salvador Roldan successfully argued that California's antimiscegenation lawdid not bar his marriage to a white woman because, as a Filipino, he was not \"Mongolian\" withinthe definition of the statute. Volpp, supra at 821. The legislature later ensured that no similarmarriages could occur by adding \"Malay\" as a category of individuals who could not marryWhites. Id at 822.22. Initially, Dan Marshall believed that a strategy based solely on religious grounds wouldbe most successful, because it could circumvent some of the unfavorable race precedents that hadbeen rendered in the antimiscegenation area. See Orenstein, supra note 3, at 390; see alsoLenhardt, The Story of Perez v. Sharp, supra note 3, at 353-54. Eventually, however, it becameclear that the case would be resolved on grounds of race alone. See Orenstein, supra note 3, at396; Lenhardt, The Story ofPerez v. Sharp, supra note 3, at 355-57.23. See Perez v. Sharp, 198 P.2d 17, 29 (Cal. 1948).24. During Reconstruction, several courts initially held that the prohibitions on interracial2008]CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEWcouples in California.25 But outside California, other state courts rarely reliedon or even cited it.26 Indeed, for years, a footnote mention in the SupremeCourt's Loving v. Virginia decision was Perez's greatest claim to fame.27But for the efforts of advocates in recent litigation to secure civil marriagerights for same-sex couples, Perez would have been consigned to legalobscurity. Advocates for same-sex marriage have been \"loving\" Perez. In casessuch as In re Marriage Cases, in which the California Supreme Courtrecently held that \"the failure to designate the official [domestic partnership]relationship of same-sex couples as marriage violates the CaliforniaConstitution,' 29 advocates have treated Perez as a landmark case that shedslight on the core meaning of marriage, perhaps even more so than Lovingitself.30 Opponents of full marriage rights for members of the LGBTcommunity frequently attack this deployment of Perez and other similar cases,insisting that it distorts precedents that, at bottom, concern issues of race alone.In this article, I argue that this assertion could not be more wrong.Far from distorting the meaning of Loving and other cases, the use ofPerez in recent litigation helps to focus attention on the problems inherent inidentity-based marriage restrictions in a way that Loving failed to do. Lovingidentifies marriage as one of the \"basic civil rights of man,\"31 but focusesprincipally on the white supremacist subtext of the antimiscegenation laws.Perez, in contrast, both engages issues of race and its social constructionthrough such law, and develops a more fulsome account of the marriage rightswith which interracial marriage bans interfered. It makes clear that thefundamental right to marry involves the freedom to marry not just anyone, butmarriage were unconstitutional in light of the newly enacted Fourteenth Amendment and thecitizenship rights it extended to freedmen and women. See Burns v. State, 48 Ala. 195 (1872); Exparte Francois, 9 F. Cas. 699 (C.C.W.D. Tex. 1879) (No. 5,047); Hart v. Hoss & Elder, 26 La.Ann. 90 (1874). A number of state legislatures also temporarily suspended their antimiscegenationstatutes as well. See MORAN, supra note 3, at 77. white Southerners, however, soon moved toreinstate antimiscegenation laws designed to help restore the social structures and norms of theslavery era. See infra at 871.25. See infra at 114.26. See infra at 114.27. 388 U.S. 1, 6 n.5 (1967).28. 43 Cal. 4th 757 (2008).29. Id. at *6. Until the California Supreme Court's decision, California reserved the officialdesignation of marriage for opposite-sex couples. The unions of same-sex couples officiallyrecognized by the state were called domestic partnerships. Id. The court held that this disparatetreatment violated the right of gay men and lesbians to marry and deprived them of the guaranteeof equal protection secured by the state constitution. See id. at *8, *9. Significantly, theConnecticut Supreme Court, in Kerrigan v. Comm 'r of Public Health (SC No. 17716, argued May14, 2007), now has an opportunity to render a similar decision about the constitutional effect of acomparable set of provisions. See id. at n.3.30. See Adam Liptak, Gay Marriage Through a Black-White Prism, N.Y. TIMES, Oct. 29,2006 at § 4, at 3.31. 388 U.S. at 12.[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYthe \"person of [one's] choice.\" 32 In this sense, Perez, with its emphasis onchoice and self-expression, goes beyond the more limited articulation ofmarriage rights that appears in the Supreme Court's decision in Loving.In addition, advocates' utilization of Perez in recent cases helps tohighlight the often overlooked fact that antimiscegenation laws served to shapesocietal norms regarding gender, as well as race. 33 To be sure, interracialmarriage bans worked to define the borders of racial identity and race. By now,the mechanisms employed by states in defining who, for example, was \"white\"or \"black\" for the purposes of antimiscegenation statutes are legend.34 But it isalso true that, for those laws, race and gender were inextricably tied.35Historians have for some time focused on the race and gender dimensions ofantimiscegenation laws.36 Legal scholars have also begun to consider inimportant ways the intersecting identities regulated by such provisions. 37 Thestrategic embrace of Perez in the marriage cases underscores this connectionand, in doing so, promises to advance understanding about antimiscegenationlaws, as well as restrictions on marriage for gay and lesbian couples.Finally, by unearthing Perez and injecting it into both legal and publicconversations about modem marriage, advocates have provided us with a pathout of the \"analogy debate\" so often a part of discussions about the rights ofgay men and lesbians to marry. 38 Perez gives us an opportunity to interrogate32. Perez, 198 P.2d at 21.33. In this article, I draw a distinction between the terms sex and gender. In utilizing theterm gender, I refer to socially constructed roles for identity performance by men and women. Inemploying the term sex, I am generally referring to biological sex.

I argue that, by restricting intimate choice, identity-basedrestrictions on civil marriage improperly limit self-definition efforts, cabinexpressions of human identity and intimacy, and have a negative impact on theability of those affected to \"belong\" as full members of the citizenry or broadercommunity in which they reside.39Part I discusses the California Supreme Court's decision in Perez,outlining the majority opinion drafted by then-Justice Roger Traynor, as well asthe concurring opinions and dissent filed in the case. It also describes thetreatment Perez received in the aftermath of the California Supreme Court'sdecision.Part II addresses how and why same-sex marriage advocates have usedPerez in recent litigation. I argue that advocates' deployment of the case, aspreviously discussed, uncovers important insights about Loving, marriage, andstate efforts to regulate access to that institution.Part III considers scholarship on the analogy often drawn between raceand gender-based restrictions on marriage, and the objections of manyopponents of marriage rights for gay and lesbian couples regarding the use ofPerez and other antimiscegenation precedents in same-sex marriage litigation. Iexplain that, contrary to the assertions of opponents, efforts to cast decisionsregarding race-based restrictions as cases about race alone are misguided. Perezitself makes clear the race and gender-based dimensions of antimiscegenationlaws.Part IV demonstrates how Perez-and the story of Andrea Perez andSylvester Davis's courtship at its center--can work to advance our thinkingabout the meaning of marriage, an institution that has undergone dramaticchanges in recent decades, and the impact of government regulation in theAnalogy to Same-Sex Marriage, 54 RUTGERS L.

Kenneth Karst introduced the term \"belonging\" in discussing the concept of equalcitizenship. See, e.g., KENNETH L.

Whether a marriage prohibition is based on gender or race, itseffect is to police the identity of the individuals seeking to marry, to ensure thattheir intimate choices and expressions of self comport with prevailing race andgender norms. With this common perspective and an understanding of the U.S.Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas,4 0 we move \"beyond analogy\"to the recognition that identity-based restrictions that prohibit someone frommarrying the \"person of [his or her] choice\" inflict a significant citizenshipharm with constitutional dimensions.4'ITHE PEREZ OPINIONSThe county clerk who denied Andrea Prez and Sylvester Davis amarriage license in 1947 applied Sections 69 and 60 of the California Code.Section 69 provided that \"no license may be issued authorizing the marriage ofa white person with a Negro, mulatto, Mongolian or member of the Malayrace. ''42 Section 60 further explained that \"[a]ll marriages of white persons withnegroes, Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes are illegal andvoid.''43 These provisions made California one of thirty states that proscribedinterracial marriages at the time.44The Perez plaintiffs' legal strategy was risky. Not only wereantimiscegenation laws widely viewed as legitimate in the late 1940s,45 but nopost-Reconstruction state or federal court had yet overturned one. Largely due40. 539 U.S. 558 (2003).41.

The first American statute specifically targeting interracial marriage was enacted in thecolony of Maryland in 1664 and soon led to the adoption of other similar statutes, particularly bystates in the South. Id. at 3; Lenhardt, The Story of Perez v. Sharp, supra note 3, at 347-48.Significantly, antimiscegenation provisions had appeared in legislation adopted prior to that time.As I discuss in more detail in Part I1, see infra at 133, a provision prohibiting sexual intimacybetween Whites and Blacks was included in a matrilineal servitude statute in 1662. See StevenMartinot, Motherhood and the Invention of Race, 22 HYPATIA 79, 87-89 (2007).It bears noting that California's antimiscegenation law was different in at least two respectsfrom those that had been adopted by states in the American South, where proscriptions againstinterracial marriage and intimacy were long-standing, dating back to slavery. First, California'slaws were more racially complex than those in effect in southern states, jurisdictions that focusedprimarily on relationships between Whites and Blacks. MORAN, supra note 3, at 17. Second, thepenalty for violating California's ban on interracial marriage was not as severe as that imposed inother states. See Lenhardt, The Story of Perez v. Sharp, supra note 3, at 349. Whereasimprisonment was the likely punishment for couples in Virginia who transgressed racial lines inthe area of intimacy, the sanction for a marriage in violation of Sections 60 or 69 was simplyvoiding the marriage. See id. The ramifications of voiding such marriages could, however, be farfrom simple, affecting issues of inheritance and property ownership, among other things. See infra137-392008]CALIFORNIA LA W REVIEWto the U.S. Supreme Court's 1883 decision in Pace v. Alabama46 -which heldthat an Alabama law penalizing interracial adultery more severely than same-race adultery was not inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment's equalprotection guarantees47--courts were unwilling to find proscriptions oninterracial marriage unconstitutional. 48 In the Pace Court's view, race-baseddistinctions in law were unproblematic when they treated individuals within49specific racial categories the same.It thus no doubt came as a surprise to many when, on October 1, 1948, theCalifornia Supreme Court ruled in Andrea and Sylvester's favor by a 4-3 vote.Led by then-Justice Roger Traynor, who wrote the majority opinion, the Courtinvalidated California's antimiscegenation law and granted a writ of mandamusrequiring the issuance of a marriage license to the couple. In doing so, itbecame the first court in the twentieth century to strike down anantimiscegenation law.5°A. Justice Traynor's Majority OpinionJustice Roger Traynor, a former tax professor at the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley School of Law (Boalt Hall), 5' was an unlikely person toauthor the majority opinion in Perez. In 1948, Traynor, who would laterbecome Chief Justice of the court, was only in the seventh year of what wouldbe his thirty-year tenure on the court. He had yet to write some of the opinionson issues of products liability, contract, and individual rights that would oneday earn him a reputation as one of the \"ablest judge[s] of his generation.\" 52There was also little to suggest that Traynor would be inclined to place himselfat the vanguard of efforts to secure racial justice.5346. 106 U.S. 583 (1882).47. Id. at 585. In doing so, Pace arguably paved the way for the separate-but-equal systemof racial segregation specifically endorsed by Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896) (holding,inter alia, that state-enforced racial segregation on trains did not violate the FourteenthAmendment). See PEGGY COOPER DAVIS, NEGLECTED STORIES: THE CONSTITUTION AND FAMILYVALUES 67 (1997); Lenhardt, The Story ofPerez v. Sharp, supra note 3, at 350-5 1.48. The Alabama statute imposed a prison term of two to seven years for interracialadultery, but imposed only a fine and up to six months imprisonment for same-race adultery. SeeCheryl I. Harris, In the Shadow ofPlessy, 7 U. PA. J. CONST. L. 867, 881 (2005).49. 106 U.S. at 585. The Court explained that Alabama's statute passed constitutionalmuster because \"[w]hatever discrimination made in the punishment prescribed in the two sectionsis directed against the offense designated and not against the person of any particular color or race.The punishment of each offending person, whether white or black, is the same.\" Id.50.

Indeed, despite his ground-breaking opinion in Perez, few people associate Traynorwith important decisions in the area of race. This said, I have suggested that his opinion in Perez[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYIt may be that Traynor, a pragmatist committed to the \"eliminat[ion] oflegal rules that ... no longer served their purpose\" 54 came to his opinion inPerez, at least initially, less out of a commitment to race issues per se than froman appreciation of the changing role of jurists at the time. As Justice Traynorwrote, the unfortunate decisions in U.S. Supreme Court cases such asHirabayashi v. United States55 and Korematsu v. United States56 were only afew years old. Courts were actively engaged in determining how to understandthe idea that \"[o]nly the most exceptional circumstances can excusediscrimination on th[e] basis [of race] in the face of the equal protectionclause.\" 57 Within this context, Traynor properly concluded that his task as ajurist was to determine whether the race-based impairment of marriage rightseffected by California law could be justified.58The state relied heavily on the work of eugenicists in defending itsantimiscegenation policy.59 In terms that prompted Andrea and Sylvester'sattorney to question how \"a servant of the people... [could be] bold enough toargue for the validity of a statute upon [white superiority] grounds,\" 6° the stateargued that interracial marriages-\"especially with respect to the 'Negro race,'which he deemed 'biologically inferior to the white'-produced 'undesirablebiological results.\"' 61 The state also argued that interracial marriages createdsocial problems,62 including the \"birth of interracial children who, as theoffspring of parents 'lost to shame,' would be 'social outcasts.'63For his part, however, Traynor relied on new research by social scientistssuch as Gunnar Myrdal, Franz Boas, and Otto Kleinberg, which, as the Perezplaintiffs' final brief to the court noted, discredited the research of theeugenicists cited by the state.64 Justice Traynor thus gave little credence to thenotion that California's law was justified because it served purposes such asavoiding social tensions or \"prevent[ing] the Caucasian race from being\"may well entitle [him] ... to billing as an early critical race theorist .... \" Lenhardt, The Story ofPerez v.

At bottom, he held that the Perez case was notabout race alone, but also about the right to marry \"the person of one'schoice.,72Two factors make this particular formulation of the case noteworthy. First,it was considerably ahead of its time. The Supreme Court did not recognizemarriage as a fundamental right at all until 1967 in Loving, when it invalidatedthe antimiscegenation statutes then in effect on Fourteenth Amendment65.

Perez, 198 P.2d at 25.[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYgrounds.73 Second, Justice Traynor, by framing the issue in this way, managedto avoid entirely the unfavorable precedent established by the Supreme Court'sdecision in Pace v. Alabama.74 Pace took the position that race-basedrestrictions on interracial intimacy posed no constitutional problem, so long asWhites and Blacks were treated equally. 75 Justice Traynor-asserting that\"human beings . . . [were not] \"as interchangeable as trains\"-dismissed theseparate-but-equal understandings reflected in Pace as applicable primarily tocases involving access to trains and education-goods that, in 1948, prior to thedecision in Brown, were still thought capable of being equalized even whereracially segregated by law.76 Such cases, he explained were \"inapplicable.,77Reasoning that \"the essence of the right to marry is the freedom to join inmarriage with the person of one's choice,\" Justice Traynor concluded that \"asegregation statute for marriage necessarily impairs the right to marry.\" 78 Thisis so, he reasoned, because, to the individual prevented \"by law from marryingthe person of his choice ... that [other] person to him may be irreplaceable. 79B. The Concurring and Dissenting OpinionsThe Perez court split along several axes. Significantly, the concurringjustices did not object to Justice Traynor's articulation of the marriage rights atstake. Rather, they wrote separately to communicate their respective ideasabout the best rationale for the judgment rendered in the case. Justice Edmonds,a Christian Scientist, drafted a concurrence adopting the view, urged in initialbriefs filed on Andrea and Sylvester's behalf,8° that the case was first andforemost about the free exercise of religion under the First Amendment, notracial discrimination.81The concurrence written by Justice Jesse W. Carter, and joined by JusticePhil Gibson, in contrast, took issue with Traynor's contention that new socialscience research had somehow undermined the bases for California'santimiscegenation provision. Challenging the idea that the validity of the state73. See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 1 (1967). Because Loving rested on dual grounds-race and marriage-some scholars argue that, for due process purposes, the first clear articulationof the fundamental nature of the right to marry did not come until the Court's 1978 decision inZablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978). See, e.g., Joseph A. Pull, Questioning the FundamentalRight to Marry, 90 MARQ. L. REV. 21, 21 (2006).74. 106 U.S. 583 (1882).75. Id. at 585.76. Perez, 198 P.2d at 25.77.

Significantly, at least one early case seeking marriage rights for gay men and lesbians seemsto have involved a similar claim. See Jones v. Hallahan, 501 S.W.2d 588, 590 (Ky. Ct. App. 1973)(rejecting, inter alia, the claim that the refusal to grant a marriage license to a lesbian coupleviolated religious freedom and imposed a punishment).2008]CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEWlaw was effectively an empirical question, 82 Carter and Gibson asserted that,under normative principles of equality set forth in the Fourteenth Amendment,the Declaration of Independence, and the recently-enacted Charter of theUnited Nations,83  Sections 60 and 69 had essentially never beenconstitutional.8 4 In their minds, these provisions \"violate[d] the very premise onwhich [the United States] and its Constitution were built . *...,85 CitingKorematsu, they emphasized that, under strict scrutiny, \"'[p]ressing publicnecessity may sometimes justify the existence of such restrictions; racialantagonism never can.' 86The three justices in dissent-Justice John W. Schenk, B. Rey Schauer,and Homer R. Spence--chastised Traynor and the other members of the Perezmajority for invalidating nearly one hundred years of California law. In doingso, they noted that twenty-nine other states had similar antimiscegenationstatutes on their books and that every federal and state court to consider theissue since Reconstruction had upheld statutes prohibiting interracial sex andmarriage.87 Above all, the dissenters took issue with Justice Traynor'scontention that something more than equal treatment was required underSupreme Court precedent such as Pace. They gave no credence whatsoever tothe idea that the fundamental right to marry included the right to marry \"theperson of one's choice.\" It was enough, Justice Schenk wrote at one point in hisdissenting opinion, that \"each petitioner has the right and the privilege ofmarrying within his or her own group.\"88C. The Aftermath of the Perez Court's DecisionThe opinion drafted by Justice Traynor in Perez led to monumentalchanges for California marriage law.89 Andrea and Sylvester, for their part,were able to wed in their home church after years of waiting. 90 But Perez didnot translate into change outside of that state. There was no immediate nationalmovement to remove antimiscegenation laws from the state codes.91 Nor did82. Perez, 198 P.2d at 29-34 (Carter, J., concurring).83. Id. at 34.84. Id. at 29.85.

Ultimately, the dissenters opined that \"[iut is not within the province of thecourts\" to second-guess findings of the legislature. Id. at 42.89. In the first two and half years following Perez, the Los Angeles County Clerk granted455 marriage licenses to interracial couples. FIELD, supra note 51, at 41. These marriages did notoccur immediately, however. The county clerk waited some time before beginning to issuelicenses to interracial couples, fearing that the decision would be overturned by the U.S. SupremeCourt. Brilliant, supra note 3, at 128.90. The wedding ceremony marked the beginning of what would be more than fifty yearsof marriage. Orenstein, supra note 3, at 404, 407. Sylvester and Andrea, who died in 2002, hadseveral children. Id.91. For example, Oklahoma, Montana, and North Dakota took until 1951, 1953, and 1955[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYother courts feel compelled to follow Perez. In fact, few courts even cited it.92Those courts that referenced Perez did not do so approvingly. TheVirginia Supreme Court, for example, mentioned Perez in Naim v. Naim93 -acase concerning an interracial marriage between a white woman and Chineseman that had been voided on grounds that it violated Virginia'santimiscegenation statute94-but dismissed it as \"contrary to the otherwiseuninterrupted course of judicial decision.\"95 It would take until 1967, when theU.S. Supreme Court decided Loving, for Perez to get any real notice outside ofCalifornia. 96 But even then, Perez appeared only in a footnote in Loving,97 evenrespectively, to remove prohibitions on interracial marriage. WALLENSTEIN, supra note 3, at 198.Nevada took until 1959 to eliminate provisions sanctioning interracial marriage, as did California,ironically, even though its Supreme Court had invalidated those provisions more than a decadeearlier. See id. at 199; Orenstein, supra note 3, at 401. Other states took longer still. SeeWALLENSTEIN, supra note 3, at 253-54. Indeed, Alabama, the last state to removeantimiscegenation law provisions from its state code, did not act until 2000, over opposition froma number of legislators. See Jeff Amy, Voters Strike Ban on Interracial Marriage, MOBILE REG.(Ala.), Oct. 8, 2000, at A24.92. This is significant given the extent to which states are said to have regularly referencedinterracial marriage decisions from other jurisdictions. Eva Saks, Representing MiscegenationLaw, 8 RARITAN 40 (1988) (explaining that, given the small\"number of miscegenation cases\" decided in states, \"[s]tate courts were forced to refer frequentlyto cases from other states\"). To put this treatment of Perez in perspective, consider the currentrecognition accorded the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's 2003 decision in Goodridge v.Dept. of Pub. Health, 798 N.E 2d 941 (2003), invalidating gender-based restrictions on marriagein Massachusetts, a decision that has led to marriages for thousands of gay and lesbian couples.See Lynn D. Wardle, Symposium on Goodridge v. Department of Public Health: Goodridge and\"The Justiciary\" of Massachusetts\", 14 B.U. PuB. INT. L.J. 57, 62 (2004) (citing ChristineMacDonald & Bill Dedman, About 2,500 Gay Couples Sought Licenses in 1st Week, BOSTONGLOBE, June 17, 2004, at Al (noting that \"[a]n estimated 2,500 marriage licenses were issued tosame-sex couples in Massachusetts in the first week, following the legalization of same-sexmarriage\" and that the rate subsequently slowed)). Even where courts have not relied on theGoodridge holding, they have acknowledged it as an important case either by citing it ordiscussing it in some detail. See, e.g., Lewis v. Harris, 188 N.J. 415, 441 (2006) (citing Goodridgein concluding that, even though same-sex marriage was not fundamental right, New Jerseyconstitution required provision of equal benefits to gay and lesbian couples, either throughmarriage or statutory mechanism adopted by the legislature); Hernandez v. Robles, 855 N.E.2d 1,6, 17 n.3, 21, 26 (N.Y. 2006) (citing Goodridge and its dissenting and concurring opinionsrepeatedly, but upholding New York state prohibition on same-sex marriage); Andersen v. KingCounty, 138 P.3d 963, 975, 979, 982-84 (Wash. 2006) (citing and discussing Goodridge beforeupholding federal Defense of Marriage statute against constitutional challenge); see also Lenhardt,The Story ofPerez v. Sharp, supra note 3, at 366-67 (explaining how many state courts grapplingwith claims by same-sex couples have felt compelled, at least minimally, to engage Goodridge).93. 87 S.E.2d 749, 753 (Va. 1955).94. Id. at 750.95. Id. at 753.96. By this time the Court had already rendered a decision in McLaughlin v. Florida, 379U.S. 184 (1964), which held that state laws criminalizing sexual intimacy and co-habitation byinterracial couples are unconstitutional. Most commentators maintain that McLaughlin, thoughoften overlooked, was an important case that arguably laid the groundwork for the decision inLoving. Ariela R. Dubler, From McLaughlin v. Florida to Lawrence v. Texas: Sexual Freedomand the Road to Marriage, 106 COLUM. L. REV. 1165, 1169 (2006).97. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 6 n.5 (1967). Significantly, the Loving plaintiffs relied2008]CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEWthough there is a strong argument that Justice Traynor's opinion inspired someof the themes addressed in Loving.98II\"LOVING\" PEREZ IN RECENT MARRIAGE LITIGATIONWere it not for advocates of marriage rights for gay men and lesbians,99the footnote mention Perez received in Loving might have been the mostrecognition it ever received.100 In recent years, however, advocates in thesecases have successfully cast Perez as a foundational decision, one withoutwhich discussions about the place of marriage in current society cannot bemeaningfully conducted. Indeed, the briefs filed and/or oral arguments made inalmost every case challenging gender-based marriage restrictions in the last tenyears has featured Perez in some way. 01 As a result, same-sex marriageon Perez in the briefs they filed before the Supreme Court. See Brief for Appellants, Loving, 388U.S. at 38Marriage is perhaps the most important of all human relationships. We think it clearthat the 'liberty' which is protected by the due process clause of the FourteenthAmendment includes the right to marry. Justice Traynor so held in his opinion in Perezv. Sharp, which invalidated California's anti-miscegenation statute.(citations omitted). Wallenstein notes that the Lovings also cited Perez in the Virginia SupremeCourt. Peter Wallenstein, Race, Marriage, and the Law of Freedom: Alabama and Virginia,1860s-1960s, 70 CHI-KENT L. REV. 371, 425 (1994). The brief quoted directly from Traynor'sdecision: \"'If the right to marry is a fundamental right, then it must be conceded that aninfringement of that right by means of a racial restriction is an unlawful infringement of one'sliberty.\"' Id. (quoting Appellant's Petition for Writ of Error at 12, Loving v. Virginia, No. 6163(Va. 1965)).98. See Lenhardt, The Story ofPerez v. Sharp, supra note 3, at 364. Warren was serving asthe Governor of California at the time the decision in Perez was rendered. See Orenstein, supranote 3, at 400, 401. There is virtually no way that he was unaware of the decision, which madeheadline news in California and in other areas of the country. FIELD, supra note 51, at 40-41;Orenstein, supra note 3, at 400-03; Brilliant, supra note 3, at 148. Indeed, it makes sense thatWarren would be intimately familiar with the particular aspects of Justice Traynor's majority,especially given that the opinion was so novel for the time and required some action on the part ofthe legislature. Orenstein, supra note 3, at 401. Interestingly, Dara Orenstein's article on Perezsuggests that Warren was advised not to push the legislature to remove Sections 60 and 69 fromthe California Code in the wake of the California Supreme Court's decision. Id. As indicatedabove, California did not repeal its antimiscegenation law provisions until 1959, six years afterWarren left the office of Governor. See id.; supra note 91.99. Litigation concerning marriage rights for same-sex couples has been part of a largereffort to secure rights for LGBT individuals in the courts. See PATRICIA A.

REV. 1551 (1993).100. Elsewhere, I have advanced several theories for why Perez has received less attentionthan Loving in cases and scholarship on marriage and antimiscegenation law. See Lenhardt, TheStory ofPerez v. Sharp, supra note 3, at 365-70. Among other things I argue that the fact thatPerez-to the extent that it involved an African American-Latino relationship rather than one thatwas black-white-was an anti-paradigm antimiscegenation case partially accounts for its failure tobe recognized more widely.

Perez as a Callfor Judicial BraveryThe current battle for gay and lesbian marriage rights is being waged, forthe most part, in state courts.' 0 3 Because of their concern about the direction offederal equal protection and due process doctrine,1°4 and the perceived hostilityof an increasingly conservative U.S. Supreme Court to potential marriageclaims, same-sex couples have generally refrained from initiating marriage-related challenges in federal court. 10 5 Instead, they have crafted a litigationaccess to marriage.

As I indicated previously, relatively few scholars have focused on Perez'scontributions to conversations about marriage. See Lenhardt, The Story ofPerez v. Sharp, supranote 3 at 342. The lack of attention paid to Perez in legal scholarship, particularly in the yearsright after Perez was decided, is striking. Two law review articles in 1953 and 1957 discuss Perez.See David Bruce Harriman, Comment, The Void for Vagueness Rule in California, 41 CALIF.

But, giventhe context in which it was decided, Loving's message to lower courts iscomparatively muted. The U.S. Supreme Court actively avoided addressing theconstitutionality of bars on interracial marriage-widely regarded as the thirdrail of race relations-for years,' 1 7 and then only did so after they had alreadydecided comparatively less controversial issues, such as those concerning racialsegregation in public schools, parks, restaurants, hotels, housing, transportation,REV. 591, 611-613 (2007) (describing key advantages of state courts action toward social changeover federal courts).

Naim v.Naim, 87 S.E.2d 749, 753 (Va. 1955) was arguably a vehicle that the Court might have employedto address the constitutionality of prohibitions on interracial marriage, but the members of theCourt are said to have worked hard in that case to find procedural grounds on which it could bedismissed.

In 1948, a full majority of states had antimiscegenationprovisions in effect. Additionally, all of the judicial opinions in the area hadupheld these statutes against challenge. 10 Further, public opinion was firmlyagainst interracial marriage.\"'I For judges hearing cases seeking marriage rightsfor gay and lesbian couples, the Perez context is more analogous to theirsituation than that of Loving, where the Court was asked to deliver the finalblow to a discriminatory regime already in decline.112108.

Lockyer, a case among those recentlydecided by the California Supreme Court in In re Marriage Cases,114 isillustrative:In 1948, when Andrea Perez and Sylvester Davis brought a writ ofaction to challenge California's ban on interracial marriage, they had alot against them. Not a single court at any level anywhere in thecountry had ever invalidated such a law. As the dissent [in Perez]noted, such laws had been in effect in this country since before ournational independence and in California since our first legislativesession in 1850. A majority of other states had similar laws, andseveral had gone as far as to amend their state constitutions to prohibitinterracial marriages. In California, the law enjoyed strong, indeedoverwhelming popular support. Nonetheless, the court ruled in theirfavor, and looking back on the decision several decades later, anyother result now seems inconceivable. In ruling on their claim, theWoo couples ask this Court to envision how the decision in this casemay be seen in future years, by those similarly detached from thepassions and prejudices of our day. We believe those futuregenerations will recognize the inherent equality of lesbians and gaymen, and will agree that striking laws that exclude them from marriagewas the only constitutionally correct choice. 115Institute for Marriage and Public Policy as saying, \"When the court moved to strike down theinterracial marriage laws . . . the democratic process was in the process of getting rid of theselaws. What's happening now is exactly the opposite: more and more states are moving to protectmarriage.\"). Some sources indicate that approximately 72 percent of the general publicdisapproves of marriage for same-sex couples. See Adam Nagourney & Megan Thee, YoungAmericans Are Leaning Left, New Poll Finds, N.Y. Times, June 27, 2007, at Al. Notably, youngerAmericans are said to be more supportive of marriage rights for gay men and lesbians. Id.

Perez as a Rejoinder to Analogy and Equal Application ArgumentsThe deployment of Perez in recent marriage cases also adds substantivecontent to advocates' claims for gay and lesbian marriage rights. Advocates usePerez's \"person of one's choice\" language to focus attention on what gay andlesbian couples seek in current marriage cases: the recognition of a sharedhumanity with others whose intimate relationships are eligible to be recognizedby the state. Loving, of course, includes language very relevant to the claims formarriage rights advanced by gay and lesbian litigants. Chief Justice Warren'sassertion that \"[m]arriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamentalto our very existence and survival\" arguably provides strong support for theextension of marriage to same-sex couples.118 Other aspects of the majorityPageServer?pagename=press-oralargument 122204.116. See Brief of Plaintiff Appellants at 29, 30 n. 15, Goodridge v. Dept. of Pub. Health,No. SJC-08860, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003) (arguing that, in Perez, the California SupremeCourt properly struck down the miscegenation law despite the popularity of these laws and ajudicial history of upholding them, and arguing that Loving is \"proof positive that constitutionalrights must be vindicated despite a history of discrimination\" or an unsupportive majority). MaryBonauto, the attorney who litigated Goodridge has written persuasively about Perez's potentialinspirational effect:I draw solace from California's Perez case where that state's high court, in a four-to-three decision with a bitter dissent, ended race discrimination in marriage in that state.It was the first state supreme court to do so, and the existing legal precedents around thecountry were contrary, and the cultural landscape was inauspicious. Yet, many of us arenow grateful that the court saw the issue as one of human equality and dignity andbroke what had been a logjam of discrimination. A large number of states repealed theirbans on interracial marriage by the time the U.S. Supreme Court decided Loving v.Virginia nineteen years later. While Dr. King was correct that progress is anything butinevitable, it is certainly a better bet that with determined time and effort, LGBT peoplewill be part of constitutional history in this country, a story of the \"extension ofconstitutional rights and protections to people once formerly ignored or excluded.\"Mary L.

See, e.g., Respondents' Opening Brief on the Merits at 52, MarriageCases, No. Al 10451, 149 P.3d 737 (noting that \"the freedom to marry is a fundamental privacy,liberty, and associational right . . . marriage is a 'fundamental freedom' under due process and'one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men\"')(quoting Loving, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967)); Respondents' Corrected Brief at 62-63, Andersen v.2008]CALIFORNIA LA W REVIEWopinion in Loving work to reinforce assertions about the effect of identity-basedrestrictions on civil marriage. Consider Warren's conclusion that \"[t]heFourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not berestricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, thefreedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with theindividual and cannot be infringed by the State.\"' 1 9 Nevertheless advocatesinvariably look to supplement the language of Loving in substantial ways, notmerely with other marriage cases-for example, Zablocki v. Redhail12° orTurner v. Safely121-- decided by the Supreme Court, but with Perez.A survey of relevant briefs makes clear that Perez gets employed to makea wide variety of substantive points. 122 Chief among these is the argument that,as a constitutional matter, a meaningful analogy can be drawn between theantimiscegenation and same-sex marriage contexts. The claim here is not thatthe oppression experienced by African Americans is exactly the same as thatconfronted by members of the LGBT community. Rather, it is that the marriagerights sought by gay and lesbian couples are not fundamentally different.'23King County, No. 75934-1, 138 P.3d 963 (Wash. 2006) (describing Loving as \"the cornerstone ofprivacy and due process protection of the right to marry ...

Vermont, No. 98-32,170 Vt. 194, 229 (Vt. 1999).Further, Perez has surfaced in response to arguments about polygamy and the possibility thatinterpreting the Due Process Clause to reach the right to marry a person of the same sex wouldopen the door to claims to this and other controversial social arrangements. For example, the briefsubmitted by the appellant in Goodridge-the Massachusetts Supreme Court decision thateventually led to the adoption of marriage rights for gay men and lesbians in that state---explainsthat the right to marry \"the person of one's choice,\" recognized in Perez, is so clearly orientedtoward monogamous romantic partners that it, by definition, would not encompass polygamousmarriages.

Health, No. SJC-08860, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003) (\"The point is not merely semantic; the exclusivity ofmarriage flows from the companionate vision of marriage as two people pledging themselves toone another that the courts have long embraced.\").123.

Harris126 have still had to defendagainst claims that Loving is only a case about race and, thus, does notencompass the right to marry sought by LGBT couples,127 and that the marriageright afforded by the Constitution extends to heterosexual marriage alone. HerePerez, which purports to interpret the Fourteenth Amendment rather than justCalifornia law, has been employed to good effect.The plaintiffs in Goodridge, for example, emphasized that Justice Traynor\"aptly observed that 'the right to join in marriage with the person of one'schoice' is at least as protected as the liberty rights to have offspring or sendone's child to a particular school.\"'' 28 Other litigants have simply argued that\"the right to make personal decisions central to marriage would be hollow if,\"as the arguments of same-sex marriage opponents could be read to imply, \"thegovernment [could properly] dictat[e] one's marriage partner.\"129Perez also surfaces frequently in efforts to rebut the argument that equalapplication of the prohibition of same-sex marriage to both sexes renders itconstitutionally legitimate.' 30 Echoing the arguments of Alabama in Pace andinterests that lie at the very heart of personal dignity and self-determination.\") (quotations andcitations omitted); Respondents' Corrected Answering Brief at 20-22, Marriage Cases, No.Al 10451, 149 P.3d 737 (\"Since Perez, California courts have continued to recognize marriage asa fundamental right . . .The liberty at stake in both cases - the right of every adult person tochoose whom to marry - is deeply rooted in history and tradition.\").124. 388U.S. at 12.125. 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003).126. 188 N.J. 415 (2006).127.

See, e.g., Respondents' Corrected Answering Brief at 31, Marriage Cases, No.Al10451, 49 Cal.

Loving, ofcourse, drew the same conclusion about the equal application argument, see 388 U.S. at 11 n. 11,but in terms that were arguably less provocative than Justice Traynor's assertion that people werenot \"interchangeable as trains.\" Perez, 198 P.2d at 25.133. Portions of the oral argument in Goodridge nicely illustrate how this argument getsadvanced:COWIN: I know we have focused on Supreme Court precedence [sic], but I would beinterested in your view on Perez, the 1948 first case to cite [sic] the miscegenationcases, is that similar or different to what is being requested here?ATTORNEY BONAUTO: It's very similar, Your Honor. In that case, again, it was race atthe heart of the choice of marital partner and the court there recognized that the right-to-marry belonged to the individual as a state court declaring that, and they alsorecognized that it was an affront to human dignity to deny people the choice of whothey want to marry based on their race. People were not, as the court put it,interchangeable like trains. You can't simply say that a man, any old man should marryJulie Goodridge.

Lewin, 852 P.2d 44 (Haw.[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYyears after it recognized the constitutional right of interracial couples to marry,the California Supreme Court recently invoked Perez repeatedly in concludingin In re Marriage Cases that the unions of same-sex couples are entitled to thesame official recognition currently extended to the unions of opposite-sexcouples. For example, the court cited Perez, its focus on the \"essence andsubstance of the right to marry,\"' 35 and its refusal to consider \"the fact thatdiscrimination against interracial marriage 'was sanctioned by the state formany years' [as] a reason to reject the plaintiffs' claim in that case '136 inconcluding, inter alia, that \"history alone does not provide a justification forinterpreting the constitutional right to marry as protecting only one's ability toenter into an officially recognized family relationship with a person of theopposite sex.\"' 137 Similarly, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reliedheavily on Perez in invalidating Massachusetts' restriction on same-sexmarriage in Goodridge, as the following passage illustrates:As both Perez and Loving made clear, the right to marry means little ifit does not include the right to marry the person of one's choice,subject to appropriate restrictions in the interests of public health,safety, and welfare ... In this case, as in Perez and Loving, a statutedeprives individuals of access to an institution of fundamental legal,personal, and social significance-the institution of marriage-because of a single trait: skin color in Perez and Loving, sexualorientation here. As it did in Perez and Loving, history must yield to amore fully developed understanding of the invidious quality of thediscrimination. 138The result achieved in In re Marriage Cases and Goodridge, however, hasnot been replicated in other jurisdictions. 39 Nevertheless, the use of Perez in1993) (declining to find fundamental right for same-sex couples to marry, but holding that statutelimiting marriage to different-sex couples established sex-based classification subject to strictscrutiny).135.

Courts in New Jersey andVermont have, however, concluded that gay and lesbian couples are entitled to the same statebenefits afforded heterosexual marriage couples. See Lewis v. Harris, 908 A.2d 196 (N.J. 2006);Baker v. State, 170 Vt. 194 (1999).20081CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEWrecent marriage cases has been successful in other ways. In addition topositioning Perez as an authority to which marriage opponents must respond,140advocates have used Perez to raise many important questions about themeaning of Loving and the institution of marriage itself.Analyses of Loving frequently focus on the language providing that \"theracial classifications [in Virginia's antimiscegenation statute] must stand ontheir own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy.\"\"141Many regard this as the \"key sentence\" in the case, 142 critical to understandingboth the Court and issues of race and equality. 143 Without disputing Loving'ssignificance as a race case, advocates effectively argue that the equal protection140. This may be the best test of whether \"loving\" Perez has been effective as a litigationstrategy. Numerous courts and/or judges have deemed it relevant to address Perez along withLoving in one way or another. With the exception of In re Marriage Cases, Goodridge and theHawaii Supreme Court's 1993 decision in Baehr, 852 P.2d 44, a good many of the citations toPerez appear in majority or concurring opinions concluding that marriage rights should not beextended to same-sex couples. See, e.g., Conaway, 932 A.2d 571; Andersen, 138 P.3d 963, 1001;see also Singer v. Hara, 11 Wash. App. 247, 255 n.8 (Wash. Ct. App. 1974) (rejecting analogy toLoving and Perez in concluding that prohibition on marriage for same-sex couples did not violatestate law). For obvious reasons, the other citations to Perez appear in opinions dissenting in wholeor part from judgments against same-sex plaintiffs. See Hernandez, 7 N.Y.3d at 380 (Kaye, C.J.,dissenting); Anderson, 138 P.3d at 1022 (Fairhurst, J., dissenting); Baker, 170 Vt. at 242 (Johnson,J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Ordinarily, references to a case that appears in adissenting opinion or that is otherwise less than uniformly positive would suggest a decision'stenuous status in case law. In this context, however, I suggest that these judicial referenceshighlight Perez's emergence as a significant marriage precedent.141. 388 U.S. 1, 11 (1967). See, e.g., Christopher A.

Sunstein, Homosexuality, supra note 105, at 17 (\"The key sentence in Loving says that'the racial classifications [at issue] must stand on their own justification, as measures designed tomaintain White Supremacy.\"') (citing Loving).143. See id. at 17-18The striking reference to White Supremacy-by a unanimous Court, capitalizing bothwords and speaking in these terms for the only time in the nation's history-wasdesigned to get at the core of Virginia's argument that discrimination on the basis ofparticipation in mixed marriages was not discrimination on the basis of race. TheSupreme Court appeared to be making the following argument. Even though the ban onracial marriage treats blacks and whites alike-even though there is formal equality-the ban is transparently an effort to keep the races separate and, by so doing, tomaintain the form and conception of racial differences that are indispensable to WhiteSupremacy.See also Bracey, supra note 141, at 713, n.198; Delgado, supra note 141, at 1280 n.49; powell,supra note 141, at 463.[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYdimensions of the Court's decision in that case are not as limited as somesuggest and ultimately speak to the need to eliminate any identity-basedobstacles to an institution as socially significant as marriage. 144Even more, litigants in recent marriage cases suggest that, while theportions of Loving sounding in equal protection are important, attention mustalso be directed at the principles underlying those parts that deal with the scopeof the right to marry under the Due Process Clause. 145 The focus on this aspectof Loving is a reminder that Chief Justice Warren could have ended his opinionin Loving with a statement about the dangers of racial classification and theillegitimacy of a white supremacist agenda, but decided instead to go further.The unmistakable message here is that the Loving Court's statements aboutmarriage mean something and that courts in current cases cannot run awayfrom their obligation to determine exactly what that meaning is.This said, it would be wrong to understand advocates' focus on Loving'sdue process elements as a complete endorsement of the view of marriageadopted by the Court. If anything, advocates' use of Perez exposes how anemicChief Justice Warren's language is compared to Justice Traynor's wonderfullyexpressive statement about \"the person of one's choice., 146 Implicitly, theysuggest that Loving itself is lacking in its articulation of the fundamental rightto marry.Briefs filed in recent cases attempt to drill down on the meaning andsignificance of the right to marry in a modem society in a way that, as I discussin Part IV, Warren's short opinion in Loving simply does not and perhaps couldnot given the era in which it was written. 147 For marriage to have meaning as144. The contention is that such restrictions support race and gender-based systems ofoppression.

Others have also urged a focus on the due process components of Loving. See JamesE. Fleming, Constructing the Substantive Constitution, 72 TEX. L. REV. 211, 257 n.231 (1993)(taking Sunstein and others to task for, inter alia, focusing on the equal protection portions ofLoving in constitutional law casebooks, but giving those relating to due process short shrift).146. In a recent book chapter on Perez, I criticized portions of Justice Traynor's majorityopinion addressing race. See Lenhardt, The Story ofPerez v. Sharp, supra note 3, at 368. Amongother things, I suggested that part of the inattention to Perez over the years might be explained byTraynor's failure to reject in strong terms the white supremacist agenda underlying California'santimiscegenation law, as Warren did when considering Virginia's ban on interracial marriage. Id.Obviously, Traynor dealt with the portions of his opinion concerning marriage in a different, farmore inspirational way.147. Chief Justice Warren may not have been free to include all of the issues that hethought relevant in deciding Loving, which might explain his opinion's brevity. Securing amajority of votes for the judgment was an obvious priority. See THE SUPREME COURT INCONFERENCE (940-1985) 696 (Del Dickson ed., 2001). As it was, reports indicate that Warren2008]CALIFORNIA LA W REVIEWone of the \"basic civil rights of man,\"'148 advocates argue that it must entailmore than the freedom to choose from a category of individuals prescribed bythe state. It must, they maintain, involve the authority to select \"the person ofone's choice\"1 4 9 and, in doing so, to make a statement before one's communitythat ultimately affirms the self as well as the existence and social significanceof an intimate human connection achieved with another person.IIITHE RACE AND GENDER DIMENSIONS OF ANTIMISCEGENATION LAWSBy using Perez in their arguments, advocates have injected the case into aprotracted and often virulent debate about the utility and appropriateness-from a constitutional as well as a historical perspective-of drawing an analogybetween antimiscegenation laws and same-sex marriage restrictions.' 50 Thosemay have had to remove citations to satisfy other members of the Court.

For example, in addition to asserting that theanalogy misrepresents the history of race in the United States,' 56 many same-sex marriage opponents have argued that the analogy signals an assault on theinstitution of marriage and represents an attempt to undermine what manyconsider its essential nature and purpose: the union between a man and awoman.157 One 2005 law review article called judicial opinions recognizing the152.

Re-thinking the Terrain of Equal Marriage Discourse, 17 CANADIAN J. WOMEN& L. / REVUE FEMME ET DROIT 405, 419 (2005)The deployment of racial analogies to advance the 'freedom to marry' are a further'whitening practice' because they enable the legal subject of these documents to 'think'itself outside of race. This is done, in one instance, by denying contemporary realitiesof racism and racial oppression. Racial analogies situate racial subjugation in ahistorical context only - something from which 'we' can now draw lessons for thecontemporary struggle of a narrow version of gay/lesbian equality rights . . . Thishistorical situating of racism obscures the fact that racial discrimination remains verymuch a part of contemporary citizenship ....154. See, e.g., Smith, supra note 150.155. See, e.g., Levit, supra note 150.156. Significantly, a number of African American leaders have been particularly vocal onthis point, publicly criticizing the contention-often made through the use of civil rights rhetoricand imagery-that the struggle for gay and lesbian rights is analogous to that waged for civilrights. See, e.g., Michael Paulson, Black Clergy Rejection Stirs Gay Marriage Backers, BOSTONGLOBE, February 10, 2004, at B1, available athttp://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/02/1 0/black.clergy-rejection-stirs-gay-marriage.backers/ (discussing similar position taken by African Americans in the Boston area); see alsoBrian Debose, Black Caucus Resists Comparison of Gay 'Marriage' to Civil Rights, WASH.TIMES, March 15, 2004, at Al (reporting reluctance on the part of members of the BlackCongressional Caucus to treat gay marriage as civil rights issue). The Reverend Jesse Jacksontook issue with the drawing of this analogy in a 2004 speech delivered at Harvard Law School.See Keith Boykin, Whose Dream: Why the Black Church Opposes Gay Marriage, VILLAGEVOICE, March 24, 2004, at 46, available athttp://www.villagevoice.com/news/0421,boykin,53751,1.html (\"'Gays were never called three-fifths human in the Constitution,' he said, and 'they did not require the Voting Rights Act to havethe right to vote.\"') The fundamental concern on the part of some-though certainly not allAfrican Americans-seems to be that the use of the analogy extends to gays and lesbians a historyand perhaps a degree of public empathy to which they are not entitled.157. A document posted on the website of the Family Research Council, a conservativenon-profit, is illustrative of how this argument gets articulated. The document emphasizes that[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYanalogy a \"[b]etrayal of Perez and Loving.\"158 It asserts, inter alia, that \"thePerez/Loving analogy advances a superficial analogy that masks a deepdisanalogy ... between the intention of Perez and Loving to protect marriagefrom appropriation for nonmarriage purposes and the intention of the presentmarriage project to make such an appropriation.\" 159At the crux of this last set of arguments is a belief that, in the end, Perezand other similar precedents are cases about race and nothing more.'60Obviously, Perez says a great deal about race. Elsewhere, I have argued thatPerez represents an early insight into the \"cruel lunacy\"' 61 of governmentefforts to define race through antimiscegenation laws.' 62 Perez also exemplifiesearly applications of strict scrutiny in the race context and serves to address therelationship between African Americans and Latinos, among other things.163But the contention that Perez does not speak to matters beyond race restson a fundamental misunderstanding of that case and the nature of the laws itinvalidated. While antimiscegenation laws like the one Andrea and Sylvesterencountered when they went to the county clerk's office seeking a marriagelicense were an attempt, on their face, to regulate race and racial intimacy, theyalso operated to define and shape other societal norms. 64 Importantly, bans oninterracial marriage played a critical role in identifying gender roles for Whites,as well as men and women of color, in much the same way that currentrestrictions on marriage help to establish gender hierarchies.65A.

Such provisions were \"straightforwardly sex-specific.\"'' 69The first statute prohibiting interracial marriage in the United States,enacted by the colony of Maryland in 1664, was plainly gendered, requiring theenslavement of any free white woman who intermarried with a black slave170Bee it further enacted by the Authority advice and Consent aforesaidThat whatsoever free borne woman shall inter marry with any slavefrom and after the Last day of this present Assembly shall serve themaster of such slave during the life of her husband And that all theIssue of such freebome woemen soe marryed shall be slaves as theirfathers were And Bee it further Enacted that all the Issues of Englishor other freeborne woemen that have already marryed Negroes shallserve the Masters of their Parents till they be Thirty years of age andnoe longer.17supra note 37; Angela Onwuachi-Willig, A Beautiful Lie, supra note 37; MORAN, supra note 3, at61-75; Barbara K.

Id.[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYLater iterations of Maryland's antimiscegenation statute were similarlygendered. For example, a 1681 statute prohibited intermarriage between whitewomen servants and black slaves.1 72 A 1692 statute later expanded the ban ofinterracial marriage to cover all white women, whether free or consigned toindentured servitude, and free Blacks, as well as slaves.73As many scholars have noted, provisions such as these early statutes werefirst and foremost about property and race.1 74 Linking slave status to blackness,as these statutes ultimately did, 175 secured a steady stream of labor for whiteplanters. 176 But women were also central to the development of the slavesystem. Maternal identity-black and white in early years-became a criticaldeterminant for servitude, as a 1662 matrilineal servitude statute enacted inVirginia makes very plain. 177 And the behaviors of white women in particular172. Id. at 209-10. The 1681 Act tried to eliminate incentives for miscegenation thatexisted under the 1664 statute by providing that white women servants induced by their masters toenter into an interracial marriage would become free instantly and that any children borne to herduring this period would also be free. Id. at 209.173. Id. at 210. The statute, in relevant part, provided:[A]ny free born English or white woman be shee free or Servant and shall hereafterintermarry with any negro or other Slave or any Negro made free, shall immediatelyupon such marriage forfeit her freedome and become a Servant during the Terme ofseven years to the use and benefit of the Ministry of the Poor ... and if he be a freeNegro or Slave to whom she intermarried, he shall thereby also forfeit his freedom andbecome a Servant to the use aforesaid during his naturall life ... and the issues of suchwomen shall likewise be Servants to the use aforesaid till they arrive at the Age of oneand twenty years ....Id.174.

Indeed, this connection became critical to theoperation of the slave system. As the court in Gobu v. Gobu, 1 N.C. 188 (N.C. 1802), explained,Blacks were presumed to be slaves under existing law. As a result, litigation in this area frequentlyinvolved individuals trying to disprove their presumptive blackness in order to escape theatrocities of servitude. See Jason A. Gillmer, Suing for Freedom: Interracial Sex, Slave Law, andRacial Identity in the Post-Revolutionary and Antebellum South, 82 N.C. L. REV. 535 (2004);Ariela J. Gross, Litigating Whiteness: Trials of Racial Determination in the Nineteenth-CenturySouth, 108 YALE L.J. 109 (1998).177. See Martinot, supra note 45, at 88, 90; see also see Hudgins v, Wright, 11 Va. 134(1806) (holding that presumption of slave status for Blacks could be rebutted by showing thatindividuals descended from Native Americans or Whites in the maternal line). Martinot explainsthat the focus on matrilinearity was a departure from \"the fundamental English legal principle ofpatriarchal descent.\" Martinot, supra note 45, at 88. He contends that the focus on maternalservitude status was symbolic of a \"decision to shift ... [the colonial] plantation labor force toAfricans and move swiftly toward perpetual servitude for Africans.\" Id.Significantly, Virginia's matrilineal line statute included a ban on interracial sex, though thisprohibition applied to both men and women. Id. at 87. It provided in relevant part:WHEREAS some doubts have arisen whether children got by any Englishman upon anegro woman should be slave or free, Be it therefore enacted and declared by thispresent grand assembly, that all children borne in this country shall be held bond or freeonly according to the condition of the mother. And that if any christian shall commitfornication with a negro man or woman, he or she so offending shall pay double thefines imposed by the former act.Id. at 87-88.20081CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEWhelped to set the parameters for whiteness, cross-racial interactions, and sexualdecency. 178 This last point is borne out by the types of punishments imposed oninterracial intimacy in the seventeenth century. As Kopytoff and Higginbothamhave emphasized, white women found to have violated norms regarding raceand sexuality frequently received more severe punishments than white menaccused of similar transgressions.' 79 Similarly, white women bearing childrenout of wedlock faced steeper sanctions for babies who were mixed-race ratherthan white: a penalty for crossing racial lines.180Later state statutory antimiscegenation provisions generally omittedspecific references to gender. 181 But the dual nature of prohibitions oninterracial intimacy remained salient throughout the darkest days of slavery andinto the post-Civil War period. 82Southern states moved quickly to establish bans on interracial intimacy inthe years after the Civil War.' 83 Once it was clear that the Reconstructionamendments and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 would not be a barrier to racialseparation in this context, 184 states adopted new, more stringent prohibitions oninterracial marriage,' 85 sometimes imposing multi-year terms of imprisonmentas punishment for transgressing racial lines.' 86 A number of legislatures evenmoved to include antimiscegenation provisions in their state constitutions.87178. Id. at90-91.179. Kopytoff& Higginbotham, supra note 166, at 1995-96.180. Id. at 1996 n.138. Under one early statute, a \"white woman, indentured or free, whohad a mulatto bastard, had to pay 15 pounds sterling or be sold into service for five years,\"whereas, under another provision, \"if an indentured servant woman had a bastard (presumably nota mulatto), she had to give only one extra year of service to her master, in addition to a fine forfornication, which was 'five hundred pounds of tobacco and casque' or 25 lashes.\" Id.181. Pascoe, Race, Gender, and Intercultural Relations, supra note 36, at 7. Indeed the vastmajority of jurisdictions opted for gender-neutral language when drafting antimiscegenationprovisions. Id.182. Many states included some prohibition on interracial sex and/or marriage in theirCodes during the antebellum period. See Gillmer, supra note 171, at 557-58 and n.21 (noting that\"[v]irtually every Southern state\" eventually legislated against interracial sex and marriage). Butsee Lenhardt, Understanding the Mark, supra note 18, at 855-56 (discussing incidence of rape ofblack women by slave masters during this period). Indeed, Gillmer reports that, in the South, onlyMississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, and Georgia failed to adopt formal bans on interracialmarriage before the Civil War. Gillmer, supra note 176, at 540 n.21. Wallenstein has speculatedon this omission in the case of Mississippi, suggesting that such a ban might have been deemedoverkill at a time when all Blacks were slaves and, thus, without the legal right to marry. PeterWallenstein, Reconstruction, Segregation, and Miscegenation: Interracial Marriage and the Lawin the Lower South, 1865-1900, 6 Am. NINETEENTH CENT. HIST. 57, 59 (2005). This theorywould seem applicable to states such as Alabama, South Carolina, and Georgia as well.183. See Pascoe, Ugly Rhetoric, supra note 150.184. As previously indicated, efforts to eliminate antimiscegenation laws following thepassage of such provisions were limited and fleeting. See supra at note 24.185.

Indeed, what one author described as an\"obsessive regard for the sanctity of white women\" pervaded legislatures andlocal communities in the wake of the Civil War.'8 9B. Antimiscegenation Laws and \"Gender Role Differentiation \"190As the previous section suggests, \"[g]ender role differentiation\"constituted one of the primary purposes of antimiscegenation laws. 191 In thecase of white women, these provisions helped to establish the white woman asthe font of racial purity and virtue, a being to be honored, protected, andultimately controlled at any cost.' 92 Desexualized in a way that their blackfemale counterparts were not, the role of white women as mother assumedparamount importance in the social system of the South. 193 Lisa LindquistDorr's fascinating account of the history of the Racial Integrity Act enacted byVirginia in the 1920s, which made it an offense for \"a white person to marryanyone of another race,\"' 94 emphasizes this reality. Dorr explains that, in the1920s, \"[f]ears about women's new [social] freedoms and changing [domestic]roles converged with eugenic concerns about racial order.\"', 95 She suggests thata desire to keep white women firmly locked into the role of mother andproducers of pure white children, and away from black men in particular,informed the legislative debates that led to the passage of the Act. 196In setting out parameters for acceptable white womanhood,antimiscegenation laws also worked to construct gender identities for other188. Eva Saks argues that Whites wanted, through race, essentially to reestablish the socialand property regimes that existed prior to the Civil War. Saks, supra note 92, at 47-48. Statutesprohibiting interracial marriage were essential to this process to the extent that they helped tocreate a group of individuals who could be collectively identified as non-white and thereforesubordinate to Whites in social, economic, and political spheres. Id.189. James Tosino, American Wedding: Same-Sex Marriage and the MiscegenationAnalogy, 73 B.U. L. REV. 93, 100 (1993).

They were cast asstereotypical Jezebels: wanton, lascivious temptresses responsible for anyunwanted sexual advances thrust upon them. 98 Black men-frequently thetarget of lynch mobs purporting to avenge a rape or perceived incidence ofsexual impropriety-became constructed as beings of superhuman strength, sooversexed and obsessed with white women that they had to be restrained andcontrolled at all costs; 19 9 above all, they had to be prevented in every way fromachieving a degree of romantic intimacy with white women. The remarkablestory of African American 20'h Century boxing sensation Jack Johnson200exemplifies the staying power of this construction. As recalled in an essay byRachel Moran, Johnson was frequently criticized for engaging in sometimesvery public sexual liaisons with white women, but \"was most severelycondemned\" and ultimately convicted of violating the Mann Act for marryingone of them.201In the race and gender hierarchy erected by antimiscegenation laws, onlywhite males fared well. Cast as gentile and honorable, they possessed andexercised full dominion and power over all others. Further, they enjoyed asexual freedom denied to white women, as well as Blacks.

Lenhardt, Understanding the Mark, supra note 18 at 855-86; see also Roberts, supra[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYwere often justified as the inevitable result of exposure to the sexual powers ofblack women. 2 4 In other words, as one scholar put it, \"'white men turned aconvenient ideological somersault to justify their own access to and violation ofblack women while furiously denouncing sex between black men and whitewomen on the grounds of racial purity.'20 5The effectiveness of interracial marriage bans in erecting genderhierarchies is also evident outside the plain text of antimiscegenation statutes or206the debates surrounding them. Historian Peggy Pascoe points to two usefulexamples.20 7 The first concerns the results of a sociological survey involvinginterracial couples in the 1920s.20 8 Pascoe notes that the survey responsessuggested that \"individual men and women's decisions to cross racial boundarylines were very often rooted in conceptions of gender relations\" as well asrace-for example, notions about which racial group's members were likely tobe the best providers or the best homemakers. 209 To illustrate this point, Pascoequotes an interview in which a Hawaiian woman explained the high rate ofinterracial marriage among women of her ethnic group: \"'The Hawaiian men,'she said, 'are not steady workers and good providers. The Chinese men aregood to provide, but they are stingy. The white men are good providers andthey give their wives more money.\"'210Pascoe's second example concerns judicial proceedings stemming fromthe enforcement of interracial marriage bans, a body of cases legal scholarshave begun to explore. 2 11 In suits for divorce, annulment, or in will contests, itwas not uncommon for one party to allege that one spouse allegedlymisrepresented her racial identity and had therefore induced her unwittingpartner to enter into an illegal marriage.2 12 Such suits invariably pitted womenof color accused of hiding their race against \"their white opponents for controlnote 199, at 366-67 (discussing sexual exploitation of black women by white men \"before andafter slavery\").203. The willingness to overlook or ignore white male transgressions of the color linewhere black women were concerned may be due to the notion that interracial marriage, rather thansex, constituted the true threat to the social order.

Ariz. 1922), an Arizona annulment case). They also demonstrate insometimes shocking terms \"the willingness of courts to invalidate [even] long-term marriages inproceedings not directly related to the marriages themselves.\" Pascoe, Race, Gender, andIntercultural Relations, supra note 36, at 8..2008]CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEWof white men's estates[.]\" 213In re Monks Estate exemplifies such a suit. 214 The case, decided sevenyears before Perez, concerned the estate of Allan Bradford Monks, a wealthywhite man, and Monk's marriage to Antoinette Giraudo. It was alleged thatMrs. Monks had both taken advantage of and defrauded her fragile husband,who had been committed to an institution for the mentally ill for five of theseven years preceding his death.215 The party alleged that her marriage toMonks, which had taken place in Arizona, was invalid because she was AfricanAmerican, not a \"French countess\" as she had allegedly told her husband.2 16The Californian trial court--despite proceedings in his which Monks submittedher fingernails and heels to an anthropologist for evaluation 21--found theseallegations persuasive, 218 concluding that Antoinette Giraudo Monks was\"seven-eighths Caucasian blood and one-eighth Negro blood, ' 219 and that hermarriage was thus void. It therefore held that the will Mr. Monks executed tobenefit his wife in 1930 was without force and could not supplant an earlierwill he drafted. 22  On appeal, Mrs. Monks objected to the lower court'sconclusion that \"she was of Negro descent, but contend[ed] that even if such [a]finding [was] . . . supported by credible evidence, . . . the Arizonamiscegenation statute [that applied was] . . .unconstitutional as imposing anabsolute prohibition against marriage upon any person of mixed Negro andCaucasian blood.\"22' She also argued that nothing in the record established thather husband had, in fact, been white, a prerequisite to voiding the marriageunder the applicable law.222 Nevertheless, the appellate court upheld the trial213. Pascoe, Race, Gender, and Intercultural Relations, supra note 36, at 8.214. 120 P.2d 167 (Cal. Ct. App. 1941).215. Id. at 171, 175.216. Id. at 171.217.

Essentially, Antoinette Monks argued that, because the trial courtdetermined that she was 7/8 white and 1/8 black-e.g., both \"Negro\" and \"Caucasian\"--that theArizona statute at issue could be read to \"prohibi[t] her from contracting any valid marriage inArizona.\" Id. at 172-73. In advancing this claim, Antoinette hit upon a concern that JusticeTraynor articulated in the vagueness portion of his majority opinion. See Perez v. Sharp, 198 P.2d17, 28 (Cal. 1948). He too was concerned about the treatment of mixed-race individuals underantimiscegenation laws. Id. Antointee Monk's decision to contest her designation as \"Negro\"stands in stark contrast to the strategy employed by Alice Rhinelander in successfully challengingher white husband's attempt to annul their marriage on the grounds of her African Americanheritage. Angela Onwuachi-Willig, in her excellent treatment of the case, explains that AliceRhinelander argued that her husband \"Leonard had known of her 'colored' background beforemarriage, as evidenced by his seeing her naked body during their premarital, sexual affairs and hisclose relationships with her family, including her mixed-race father and her clearly coloredbrother-in-law.\" Onwuachi-Willig, supra note 37 at 2399-400.222. Similar questions had been raised about husbands in other cases. Pascoe cites theexample of the Arizona case of Kirby v. Kirby, 206 P. 405 (Ariz. 1922). Pascoe, MiscegenationLaw, supra note 2, at 44-52. Joe Kirby secured an annulment of his marriage to his wife Mayellen[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYcourt's conclusions regarding fraud and rejected the \"interesting\" issue of raceraised by Mrs. Monks as not directly presented by the case.223While we can surmise only so much from this one example, the resolutionof In re Monks Estate tracks the pattern of disenfranchising women of color224identified by Pascoe.  At the end of her case, Antoinette was left with neitheran estate nor any formal link to the man she had called her husband. Further,the opinion highlights in at least one other respect the extent to which theantimiscegenation context served as an important site for the maintenance ofgender-based hierarchies. 225 Assuming the veracity of the court's conclusionthat Antoinette Monks engaged in racial misrepresentation, it seems clear thatshe \"passed\" not only to avoid the restrictions imposed on her because of race,but to circumvent those imposed by gender. By marrying her husband,Antoinette arguably took on the persona of a pure, respectable woman in a waythat would have been unattainable had she revealed as a black, female identity.This is evident in the language the court used to discuss the case once itbelieved it has uncovered Antoinette's \"true\" identity. It was full of disdain foron grounds that she had \"negro\" blood, but only after questions arose and testimony was given onhis own racial lineage. Id. Kirby's mother was cross-examined on the question whether her\"Mexican\" background included Native American ancestors. Id. at 45. And Mayellen Kirby'sattorneys argued that her husband Joe looked \"Indian.\" Id. at 5 1. Sounding a note that resonateswith the county clerk's actions in Perez, the trial court declined to consider questions ofappearance, explaining that \"Mexicans are classed as of the Caucasian race. They are descendants,supposed to be, of the Spanish conquerors of that country, and unless it can be shown that they aremixed up with some other races, why the presumption is that they are descendants of theCaucasian race.\" Id. at 51 (citation omitted).223. 120P.2dat 173.224.

Ferrall, 69 S.E. 60 (N.C.1910), two cases in which state courts had, on grounds of fairness, rejected suits for divorce byhusbands who claimed that their wives had, unbeknownst to them, misrepresented their racialidentity).225. See Pascoe, Race, Gender, and Intercultural Relations, supra note 36, at 8. I amgrateful to Professor June Carbone for encouraging me to consider the decision in Borelli v.Brusseau, 16 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16 (Cal. Ct. App. 1993), a California case in which a court rejected awife's attempts to enforce against her husband's estate an oral promise he made to conveyproperty to her in exchange for her oral promise to care for him following a stroke, concluding,inter alia, that the promises made by the wife, who had earlier executed a prenuptial agreementwith her husband, concerned obligations she already had to care for her husband. See Martha M.Ertman, Legal Tenderness: Feminist Perspectives on Contract Law, 18 YALE J.L. & FEMINISM545, 567-70 (2006). The reading of Borelli that suggests its holding might be explained by judicialconcerns about women taking advantage of husbands whom they wed relatively late in life mightalso apply to aspects of In re Monks Estate. See Email from June Carbone, Professor of Law,University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, to R.A. Lenhardt, Associate Professor of Law,Fordham Law School (January 1, 2008) (on file with author). Given the substantial discussion ofrace during the In re Monks Estate trial and in the court's opinion in that case, however, my senseis that concerns about race and the efforts of Antoinette Monks to subvert her place as a blackwoman in society were at least as, and likely more, germane to the outcome in the case.2008)CALIFORNIA LA W REVIEWAntoinette Monks-newly demoted to black-female status-and what itregarded as her \"fraudulent representations\" with respect to her racial identityand \"undue influence over decedent's testamentary act[.]226In my view, this and other similar evidence of genderization, coupled withthe statutory history just discussed, suggests that meaningful parallels betweenantimiscegenation laws and current restrictions on same-sex marriage can bedrawn.227 Though operationalized-either implicitly or overtly228-through afocus on biological sex, current restrictions on marriage for same-sex couplesare, in fact, concerned with the preservation of gender, socially constructednorms about the roles that men and women should carry out in society. 229 Thesex-specific roles of bride and groom send clear messages about \"what it meansto be a man and what it means to be a woman.\"2 30 Articulating this argument ina recent online essay, Professor Richard Ford pointed to comments such as226.

Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, which explicitly definesmarriage as a union between \"one man and one woman,\" I U.S.C. §7 (1996), and provides that nostate will have to recognize same-sex marriages executed in another jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. §1738C (1996). See also Cooper, supra note 150, at 338. Since then, often in response toGoodridge, scores of states have also moved toward sex-specific definitions of marriage,modifying the language of their marriage statutes, including sex-specific provisions regardingmarriage in their constitutions, or passing state-level Defense of Marriage Acts specificallydefining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. See Cooper, supra note 150; see alsoPascoe, Ugly Rhetoric, supra note 150 (noting that many states moved to take these actions muchearlier than Goodridge and suggesting that they did so in reaction to Loving's invalidation ofantimiscegenation laws). Even where no sex-specific language is employed, however, marriagestatutes have been read essentially to include them. See, e.g., Hemandez v. Robles, 855 N.E.2d 1,I (N.Y. 2006).229.

It could certainly be employed to make the case that theexperiences of African Americans and others in the interracial marriage contextand gay and lesbian couples in the same-sex marriage context are similar inimportant ways. 233 Quite apart from some of the analogy-related concerns234detailed above, however, the question remains: what does advancing such ananalogy accomplish? Does it help to elucidate fully questions about modemmarriage or the right of gay and lesbian couples to access it to any appreciabledegree? I argue that it does not. If anything, it obfuscates important issues thatarise in this context.The move to analogy seen in popular discussions about marriage rights forsame-sex couples relies on a particular reading of the history of race and sexualorientation-based discrimination, but is informed by the Supreme Court'sFourteenth Amendment analytical structure.235 Under the Court's three-tiered231. Richard Thompson Ford, Hate and Marriage: Same-sex Marriage Setbacks May NotBe All Bad News for Gay Rights, SLATE, July 12, 2006,http://www.slate.com/toolbar.aspx?action=print&id=2145620.232. Id.233. I think this holds true for other issues as well. Obviously, real differences betweenthese groups do exist. See Randall Kennedy, Marriage and the Struggle, supra note 150, at 788.But this need not be fatal. Analogies are, by definition, inexact. See also Nan D. Hunter, SexualOrientation and the Paradox of Heightened Scrutiny, 102 MICH. L. REV. 1528, 1551 (2004)[hereinafter Hunter, Sexual Orientation] (noting that \"law operates by analogy,\" which \"bedevilsthe law of sexuality.\").234. See supra note 151-155.235. Pam Karlan used the term \"analogical crisis\" to describe the extent to which thequestion of gay and lesbian rights hampers the law of sexuality and the Supreme Court's approachto it. Pamela S. Karlan, Foreword: Loving Lawrence, 102 MICH. L. REV. 1447, 1450 (2004); seealso Hunter, Sexual Orientation, supra note 233, at 1551. Karlan argues that cases such asLawrence and Romer to some extentinvolve[] regulation of particular acts in which gay people engage, and so seem[] mostamenable to analysis under the liberty prong of the Due Process Clause, while in otherways [they] involve[] regulation of a group of people who are defined not so much bywhat they do in the privacy of their bedrooms, but by who they are in the public sphere.2008]CALIFORNIA LA W REVIEWanalysis, a minority group merits heightened constitutional protection fromdiscrimination only insofar as it can analogize its characteristics or claims tothose already addressed by an established tier.236 The answers to theseformalistic inquiries drive the court's analysis, setting, as advocates' argumentsabout the breadth of the right recognized in Loving imply,237 the level ofgenerality at which a group's rights are conceptualized 23 and the degree ofscrutiny that will be applied.239Legal scholars have criticized the court's analysis for its \"rigidity\" and\"internal inconsistency,\" 240 because, while it highlights certain issues, itobscures many other important issues from view. In particular, the focus onmatching group experiences means that the precise nature of the governmentpolicy or practice at issue often remains insufficiently explored, particularly ifthe policy affects a group which is only due rational basis review.241Karlan, supra at 1457. In other words, she contends that the question of gay and lesbian rightsdoes not fit nicely into the tiered analysis the Supreme Court applies in Equal Protection and DueProcess cases, a fact underscored by Lawrence and Romer, as they are both instances in which theCourt departed from the rational basis review typically applied when no suspect class orfundamental right is at stake. Id. at 1450.236. The first issue of course bears on the extent to which a particular group might beregarded as a suspect class for Equal Protection purposes. See id. at 1460; see also Fullilove v.Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 519 (1980) (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment) (discussing race andfactors relevant to suspect classification). The second goes to the question whether a right thatmight properly be characterized as fundamental is at stake in the Due Process context. See Karlan,supra note 235, at 1450; see also Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 470 (1977) (discussingfundamental rights and the application of strict scrutiny). In both instances, affirmative answers tothese questions would require the application of heightened scrutiny. See Regents of Univ. of Cal.v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 357 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part)Unquestionably, we have held that a government practice or statute which restricts'fundamental rights' or which contains 'suspect classifications' is to be subject to 'strictscrutiny' and can be justified only if it furthers a compelling government purpose and,even then, only if no less restrictive an alternative is available.237. See supra at 863-65.238. See supra note 213.239. Id.240. See Suzanne B. Goldberg, Equality Without Tiers, 77 S. CALIF. L. REV. 481, 508(2004); Jeffrey M. Shaman, Cracks in the Structure: The Coming Breakdown of the Levels ofScrutiny, 45 OHIO ST. L.J. 161, 173-74, 175-77 (1984). Significantly, Supreme Court JusticesThurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens both expressed doubts about the utility of tiered levelsof constitutional scrutiny at various points in their career. See, e.g., Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202,231 (1982) (Marshall, J., concurring) (joining the Court's opinion but criticizing the Court's\"rigidified approach to equal protection analysis\"); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 211-12 (1976)(Stevens, J., concurring) (maintaining that \"[tihere is only one Equal Protection Clause,\" and itdoes not direct the courts to apply different standards of review).These concerns have paved the way for a host of proposed alternative frameworks relying ona single standard of constitutional evaluation. See, e.g., Goldberg, supra, at 491-92 (advocating a\"proposed single standard [that] consists of three inquiries that emerge from the Equal ProtectionClause's fundamental opposition to laws distinguishing between classes for no legitimatepurpose\") (citations omitted); Shaman, supra, at 183 (advocating the adoption of a \"unifiedsystem ofjudicial review\").241. This is especially true when-as here, to the extent that gay men and lesbians areunlikely to be treated as a suspect class and many jurists would regard the policy employed by[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYIn the sections that follow, I argue that, rather than merely preserving theessential character of traditional marriage as typically alleged, identity-basedrestrictions on marriage-whether race or gender-based-have servedprimarily to police and restrain expressions of identity 242 and, ultimately, therange of possibilities for human intimacy. 243 Section A builds upon the insightthat race and gender are both implicated in anti-miscegenation laws andexplores the role that state and local officials have played in the policing of raceand gender identity in the United States. Section B then moves to examine thetangible effects of identity policing of this sort on the standing of gay men andlesbians in the United States.244 Using Perez as a starting point, Section Bbegins by asking what the right to marry means in our current context, whenmarriage no longer serves as the primary vehicle for childrearing, sex, orintimacy. It then considers the implications, post-Lawrence, of being excludedfrom civil marriage because of the state's interest in preserving certain identityroles or categories. I argue that casting state regulation in this area as identitypolicing helps to clarify the extent to which gender-based restrictions onmarriage adversely affect the citizenship rights of gay men and lesbians andimpair their ability to achieve full \"belonging\" in the broader community. 245states in administering marriage laws a \"neutral\" with respect to categories like race or gender-the level of scrutiny a court is likely to apply is relatively low, and as a result, a fair amount ofdeference will be accorded government actors. See Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S.432, 440 (1985).The general rule is that legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if theclassification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.When social or economic legislation is at issue, the Equal Protection Clause allows theStates wide latitude, and the Constitution presumes that even improvident decisions willeventually be rectified by democratic processes. The general rule gives way, however,when a statute classifies by race, alienage, or national origin.(citations omitted). This said, the Court has been willing to apply a \"more searching form ofrational basis review\" in recent cases involving gay rights. Lawrence v, Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 580(2003); see also Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632 (1996) (holding that the law at issue could nothave served a legitimate state interest, and could only be rationalized as animus towards thetargeted class); Hunter, Sexual Orientation, supra note 233, at 1551.242.

Kenneth Karst has argued that \"belonging\"constitutes an integral part of equal citizenship. Id. at 3. In this article, I am focused on aconception of citizenship that primarily emphasizes inclusion and social acceptance rather than,for example, one focused on one's relationship to the nation state. And, in that connection, myassessment of the harms that flow from marriage exclusion are not necessarily limited to thosewho are formal citizens. See Jennifer Gordon and R.A. Lenhardt, Rethinking Work andCitizenship, 55 UCLA L. Rev. 1161 (forthcoming June 2008) (discussing conception ofcitizenship or belonging not limited to formal citizens). For a discussion of the dimensions of2008]CALIFORNIA LA W REVIEWA. Marriage Regulation as Identity PolicingFeminist scholars have been especially attuned to the historic role of civilmarriage in establishing gender roles and delineating men's and women's\"rights and responsibilities in the polity. 2 46 The extent to which the commonlaw constructed women as subservient, without a legal identity of their own andobligated to provide \"husband[s] domestic service, sexual access, affection,companionship, and care,\" 247 and portrayed men as dominant, owing \"supportand protection\" to their wives, but also imbued with \"the right to chastise[them] moderately (physically punish) ... for misbehavior\" 248 has been well-249documented. Just as important as this setting of social norms, however, is theextent to which state regulations have also served over time to reproduce andpolice identity norms in the marriage context. By identity policing, I meansomething more than the mere articulation of a code of behavior or a preferencefor a particular group or physical characteristic. Instead, I refer to the activeattempt on the part of the state to monitor, maintain, and manipulate identity, topatrol its borders in much the same way a police officer might guard ajurisdictional boundary or keep watch for an intruder.In both the antimiscegenation law and same-sex marriage ban contexts,250identity policing of this sort has served primarily to demonstrate that, as onescholar put it, \"there are just 'two kinds[]' 2 51 -for example, two races, blackand white, 252 and two genders, male and female. 253 Eva Saks helped to explaincitizenship, see Angela Harris, Loving Before and After the Law, supra note 37, at 2821; see alsoLinda Bosniak, Citizenship Denationalized, 7 INDIANA J.

In recognizing this, I do not mean to support theview that there are, in fact, only two kinds. I recognize, for example, that the discussion I conductin the pages that follow arguably ignores the realities of gay and lesbian people of color whoseexperience transcends matters of race or sexual orientation alone. See, e.g., Carbado, supra note150, at 1484-99; Hutchison, Gay Rights, supra note 38, at 1358, 1377-78; Hutchinson, Out YetUnseen, supra note 150, at 631-35. The focus on \"two kinds\" is designed to trace legal accountsof race and gender difference, not to set out my own understanding.252. See COLKER, supra note 251, at 3-6, 20, 121-23;. This has been true even where, as in[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYthe perceived need for preserving these separate categories-grounded innotions of white supremacy and white patriarchy, respectively 254-inemploying the following quote:'The same law which forbids consanguineous amalgamation forbidsethnical amalgamation. Both are incestuous. Amalgamation is incest.'The taboo of too different (amalgamation/miscegenation) isinterchangeable with the taboo of too similar (incest), since bothcrimes rely on a pair of bodies which are mutually constitutive of eachother's deviance, a pair of bodies in which each body is the signifier ofthe deviance of the other. Neither body can represent the norm,because each is figured as deviance from an other. (This complex ofanxiety and taboo also evokes the jurisprudence of sodomy, anotherarea of the law in which a pair of bodies constitutes deviance uponconjunction. Because they are too similar to each other, and todifferent from the 'norm,' the bodies of sodomy are legally Other.)255Historically, identity policing in these contexts seeks to resist or ignoreany instability in the socially constructed categories of race and gender.Consider the country clerk's insistence in Perez that Andrea be treated as whitefor the purposes of California's antimiscegenation statute. Also, such regulationattempts to suppress difference and individual expressions of selfhood tomaintain the integrity of identity categories that are thought necessary tosustain the existing social order.2 56 The failure of many antimiscegenationstatutes to take account of the existence and experience of so-called mixed-raceindividuals is illustrative. 257 In the case of both race and sexual orientation, thefear is that \"[m]arriage between [the relevant groups] could ... destabilize thecultural meaning of marriage,\" rendering it an institution unrecognizable fromwhat it has traditionally been. 258The kind of identity policing agenda just described requires more than amere statute or other similar statement of policy. It also requires people on theground to enforce the boundaries, with a mandate to identify and resolvequickly any threats to the established norms. Here, the county clerksstates like California, antimiscegenation statutes meant to prohibit interracial marriage by a varietyof groups, African Americans, as well as individuals of Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino descent.In such circumstances, the incorporation of a range of racial groups was still designed to create\"two kinds\"--white and non-white. See Deenesh Sohoni, Unsuitable Suitors: AntimiscegenationLaws and the Construction ofAsian American Identities, 41 LAW & Soc'y REV. 587, 612 (2007).253.

App. 2006) (Klein, J.,dissenting).2008]CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEWresponsible for the fairly mundane task of issuing marriage licenses have beenessential.259 In the antimiscegenation context, county clerks served as the firstline of defense against the possible erosion of racial lines.260 Their role wascritical. Interracial marriage was seen as the ultimate offense, far worse thanmere sex between the races.261As a result, clerks wielded significant authority for making on-the-spotdeterminations about the racial background of those seeking applications. Theydid so according to what some have referred to as a \"sixth sense,\" and theymade their decisions pursuant to any criteria they deemed relevant, such as skincolor or hair texture. 262 The clerk who declared Andrea P6rez white for thepurposes of California's law explained, \"I don't just sit here and look at peopleand say, 'You're white,' or 'You're Negro.' . . . I took time to study thesethings. 263County clerks have served a similar role in the same-sex marriagecontext. 264 Before Richard John Baker and James Michael McConnell becamelitigants in the first case seeking marriage rights for same-sex couples broughtin the United States,265 they \"made application to... Gerald R. Nelson, clerk ofHennepin County District Court, for a marriage license,\" in accordance withstate law.266 Nelson's denial of a license to that couple foreshadowed the extentto which country clerks would again be thrust into the vanguard of efforts toreinforce identity categories.259. See Pascoe, Ugly Rhetoric, supra note 150. Significantly, other bureaucratic officialscould also be instrumental in shoring up racial boundary lines. Dorr discusses letters sent byVirginia's Bureau of Vital Statistics in the 1920s to white women thought to have violated thestate Racial Integrity Act. Dorr, Principled Expediency, supra note 107, at 153 (quoting Letterfrom W.A. Plecker to Mrs. Robert H. Cheatham (April 30, 1924), copy to John Powell, Box 56,JPC)This is to give you warning that this is a mulatto child and you cannot pass it off aswhite. A new law passed by the last legislature says that if a child has one drop of negroblood in it, it cannot be counted as white. You will have to do something about thismatter and see that the child is not allowed to mix with white children, it cannot go towhite schools and can never marry a white person in Virginia.260.

There are, however, many reports indicatingthat clerks sometimes refused to enforce racial norms, granting licenses to couples whosemarriage plainly violated statutory rules. See Orenstein, supra note 3, at 387.262. Id. at 402 (quoting Marriage Recorder Uses \"Sixth Sense\" to Determine Race, L.A.SENTINEL, Dec. 23, 1948).263. Id.264.

Id. at 185.[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYWhat is at stake in this context is not the integrity of socially constructedcategories of race, but rather the \"gendered definitional boundaries ofmarriage.\" 267 Indeed, in some of the most public contests around same-sexmarriage, county clerks have been absolutely central. As in the race context,268these low-level officials, in issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, havesometimes been willing to ignore the existence of the categories they have been269enlisted to police. For the most part, however, they have strongly resistedany efforts to bend the gender norms on which marriage statutes rely.270Of course, courts have also played an important role in the policing ofidentity through race and gender-based restrictions on marriage. 271 In theantimiscegenation context, this identity enforcement came in the form of casesinvolving the direct challenges to antimiscegenation laws or, frequently, indivorces, will contests, or suits for annulment.272 These proceedings served as amechanism for both uncovering and effectively punishing individuals who hadtransgressed racial lines by violating antimiscegenation laws.273 Courts activelyparticipated in the complex tasks of applying the widely divergent andconflicting rules states had for defining race, 274 and trying to make267. Hunter, Marriage, supra note 160, at 13.268. See Orenstein, supra note 3, at 387.269. For example, county clerks in Oregon issued approximately 3,000 marriage licenses togay and lesbian couples. See Li v. State, 110 P.3d 91, 94 (Or. 2005) (holding, inter alia, grant oflicenses was without authority). In San Francisco 2004, county clerks, at the behest of the mayor,revised official marriage license applications and certificates in order to permit same-sex couplesto marry, an action that paved the way for the California Supreme Court to conclude that same-sexand opposite-sex couples could not be treated differently where full marriage rights are concerned.See In re Marriage Cases, 43 Cal. 4th at 785-87 (discussing procedural events leading todecision on the merits). In that same year, a clerk in Sandoval County, New Mexico granted 66licenses to gay and lesbian couples seeking to marry before being forced to desist by the stateattorney general. See Alan Cooperman, Jonathan Finer, & Fred Barbas, Gay Couples Wed inMass., WASHINGTON POST, May 17, 2004, at AO1, available athttp://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A32954-2004May7?language=printer.270. Indeed, as the Baker case foreshadowed, most of the cases in this context are precededby the denial of a license by a clerk. Consider the example of Anderson v.

Recall the In re Monks Estate trial court'sdetermination that Antoinette Monks was 7/8 white and 1/8 black. In reachingthis conclusion, the court heard testimony from an anthropologist, who\"testified that in his opinion [Antoinette Monks] 'was at least one-eighthNegroid;'\"276 a physician \"who had had much experience in the southern statesand in Africa in his profession,\" who confirmed this assessment on the basis ofhis own opinion; 277 and from a beauty parlor operator who allegedly providedMrs. Monks with clandestine, after-hours service and contended that she wasable to divine Mrs. Monks' African American heritage by looking at \"the palmsof her hands and her fingernails.,278wide variety of tests states applied in determining racial identity).275.

Significantly,Traynor raised a concern about the standards employed in policing race as early as the oralargument in Perez. His colloquy with the state's attorney, Stanley, evinces deep skepticism aboutefforts to define race at all:Mr. Justice Traynor: What is a negro?Mr. Stanley: We have not the benefit of any judicial interpretation. The statute statesthat a negro [sic] cannot marry a negro , which can be construed to mean a full-bloodednegro, since the statute also says mulatto, Mongolian, or Malay.Mr. Justice Traynor: What is a mulatto? One-sixteenth blood?Mr. Stanley: Certainly certain states have seen fit to state what a mulatto is.Mr. Justice Traynor: If there is 1/8 blood, can they marry? If you can marry with 1/8,why not with 1/16, 1/32, 1/64? And then don't you get in the ridiculous position wherea negro cannot marry anybody? If he is white, he cannot marry black, or if he is black,he cannot marry white.Mr. Stanley: I agree that it would be better for the legislature to lay down an exactamount of blood, but I do not think that the statute should be declared unconstitutionalas indefinite on this ground.Mr. Justice Traynor: That is something anthropologists have not been able to furnish,although they say ... there is no such thing as race.Transcript of Oral Argument at 3-4, Perez, 198 P.2d 17 (No. L.A. 20305).276.

It was common for courts in this context toconsider many different forms of evidence, including testimony about an individual's habits,social practices (for example, whether the person \"sits in the white section of public conveyancesor theatres\"), racial reputation in the community (for example, are they regarded as Caucasian orAfrican American), ethnological research, and even physical evaluations.

Id.[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYFor courts in the same-sex marriage context, the policing of gender hasinvolved pronouncements about the essential nature and function of marriagemore often than the actual interrogation of bodies.279 The language employedby the Minnesota Supreme Court in Baker v. Nelson is both representative andinstructive:The institution of marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquelyinvolving the procreation and rearing of children within a family, is asold as the book of Genesis. Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,which invalidated Oklahoma's Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act onequal protection grounds, stated in part: \"Marriage and procreation arefundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.\" Thishistoric institution manifestly is more deeply founded than the assertedcontemporary concept of marriage and societal interests for whichpetitioners contend.Even so, there have been occasions in which courts have engaged in thesame sort of identity-scrutinizing and disenfranchising behavior evinced in Inre Monks Estate. Take the example of cases involving transgendered peopleasserting claims based on marriage relationships.281 Littleton v. Prange did notchallenge prohibitions on individuals of the same biological sex from marrying279. Feminist scholars have urged that limitations on marriage for same-sex couplesreinforce stereotypes about women and men in their respective roles within marriages and otherintimate relationships.

In Littleton, Christie Littleton, a post-operative transsexual female,filed a medical malpractice suit following the death of her husband, JonathonMark Littleton, to whom she had been married for seven years.28 4 The questionpresented was whether, as a person born a biological male, Christie Littleton,whom her doctors regarded as medically female, could properly be regarded asa spouse for the purposes of the Texas Wrongful Death and Survival Statute.28 5After considering medical evidence and Christie's particular history, amongother things, the appellate court concluded that the answer was no, affirmingthe trial court's grant of summary judgment in the case. It held that \"as a matterof law, [] Christie Littleton is a male. As a male, Christie cannot be married toanother male. Her marriage to Jonathon was invalid, and she cannot bring acause of action as his surviving spouse.2 86In both the antimiscegenation and same-sex marriage contexts theimmediate goal of identity policing on the part of county clerks and courts hasbeen to preserve \"two kinds\" by invalidating individual expressions that mightthreaten race or gender norms. Interestingly, the overall aim of such policinghas been to shape and limit the expression of human intimacy generally, todetermine who can safely be loved and who is too socially \"spoiled\" to be theobject of anyone's affection.287 In many ways, marriage threatens to undermine288the legitimacy of rigid identity categories more than any other phenomenon.As one scholar of antimiscegenation laws explained, \"ban[s] on interracialmarriage [were] an attempt to censor-to make all but unspeakable-a desirenot for sex, but for marriage precisely because marital intimacy posed a moreprofound challenge to the racial order.\" 289 Similarly, marriage bans are integralto the demonization of gay and lesbian intimacy and the strength of the socialtaboos in this area.290 Opponents of same-sex marriage fear that, in a universe282. 9 S.W.3d 223 (Tex.

Interestingly, the court's reasoning and focus on biological sex suggeststhat it would have been permissible for Christine to marry a woman. Indeed, such a conclusionwould be necessary to give minimal content to Christine's right to marry. At the same time, itseems likely that, if Christine were to pursue such a marriage, the judicial concerns about genderroles latent in Littleton and other opinions would inevitably emerge and serve as a barrier to legalrecognition.287.

Texas has already decriminalized gay and lesbian sex,291the removal of gender-based restrictions on marriage will lay bare once and forall the humanity of gay and lesbian couples, normalizing what has long been astigmatized identity. This fear parallels the way in which Loving helped make292interracial relationships more socially acceptable. In a sense, our legalregime's recognition of a romantic union has \"bec[o]me the discernible mark orseal to authenticate a domain of pure humanity. 293B. The Citizenship Implications of Marriage Restrictions on Same-Sex CouplesAs scholars have noted, \"[m]arriage law [has been] a primary site for theproduction of normative citizenship\" in the United States.294 Thus, in policingidentity in the ways described above, the states, in many ways, can beunderstood to be engaged in a process of determining who is and who is not agood citizen, who should and should not be welcomed as a full and constituent295part of the broader community. As a historical matter, conformity with raceand gender norms in marriage has been a prerequisite to inclusion. 29 In thepages that follow, I continue to focus on state governments and the legitimacyand effects of their denial of marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples. First,however, I turn to a question advocates have sought to address in employingPerez in recent marriage litigation: what is the meaning of the right to marry inour current context? What does it mean for the individuals who seek to marry?In considering this issue and how Perez helps to explicate it, we gain a bettervantage point from which to assess the effects of identity policing on gay andlesbian couples seeking to marry in a post-Lawrence context.1.

As I indicated at the outset of thisarticle, neither of them wanted simply to cohabitate, an option that was fullyavailable to them since California's antimiscegenation law proscribed onlyinterracial marriage, not sex.29 7 They wanted marriage, something the U.S.Supreme Court has described as \"the most important relation in life, 29 8 and \"anassociation that promotes a way of life not causes; a harmony in living, notpolitical faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects . . . anassociation for as noble a purpose as any .... ,299 But they also sought to marryin a way that honored not just their religious beliefs as Catholics, but also theiraspirations as members of the community. A religious ceremony without statesanction would have been unappealing. Receiving the sacrament of marriage intheir home church3°° and in their home state was the goal. 301 For them,marriage clearly served, in part, as a vehicle for gaining civic membership.30 2The conception of marriage to which Sylvester and Andrea subscribed in1948, however, was arguably very different from ideas about marriage today.30 3As Rachel Moran reminds us in a recent article commemorating the fortiethanniversary of Loving, marriage has changed dramatically over the years.304Whereas marriage, as the U.S Supreme Court's decision in Zablocki v. Redhailintimates,305 used to be the primary site for sexual intimacy, procreation,parenting, and economic well-being,306 it no longer holds this exalted positionin our society.30 7 Premarital sex no longer carries the stigma it did when297.

While the incidence of domestic violencewithin marriage, see, e.g., Shannon Selden, The Practice of Domestic Violence, 12 U.C.L.A.WOMEN'S L.J. 1 (2001), among other things, certainly suggests that married women may not yetbe entirely free of the subjugated role prescribed for them at common law, we have come a long[Vol. 96:839BEYOND ANALOGYSylvester and Andrea were dating. 308 Nor, for example, do out-of-wedlockbirths.3 °9 Indeed, more and more women, in particular, are raising childrenoutside of the structure of a marital relationship. 310 Likewise, more people thanever before are choosing to divorce or never to marry at all. 3 11 \"[Miarriageaccounted for 84 percent of households\" in 1930, but just \"49.7 percent ofAmerican households\" in 2006.312In advancing claims for access to marriage, advocates for same-sexcouples must and do rely on the Court's landmark decision in Loving.313 But, asthe move toward deploying Perez in challenges suggests, there are ways inwhich the Court's decision in Loving fails to offer useful insights into thecontemporary meaning of civil marriage.314 Of course, the Warren Court likelynever dreamt for a moment that its judgment would be used to support claimsfor same-sex couples to marry.3 15 As it is, it took them years to be willing todecide that race-based restrictions within different-sex marriage wereunconstitutional.31 6 Even more than this, though, Warren's opinion in that caseis devoid of a real discussion of the place marriage has in society. Consistentwith the embrace of color-blindness started in Hirabayashi v. United States317and Korematsu v. United States,318 the Court's thoughts on race and equalprotection are most prominent in the opinion.3 19 A rejection of a whitesupremacist agenda and deep concerns about racial classifications emerge mostway from the day when Justice Bradley, concurring in the Supreme Court's rejection of MyraBradwell's challenge to her exclusion from the Illinois bar on grounds of gender, maintained that\"[t]he paramount destiny and mission of a woman are to fulfill the rioble and benign offices ofwife and mother.\" Bradwell v.

The majority clearly meantthe Due Process Clause to be one of the legs on which Loving rested. But, at thesame time, the Court's conclusion on this point cannot be easily discerned.321Chief Justice Warren talked about \"the freedom of choice to marry,\" 322 butomitted discussions of due process that had appeared in early drafts of hisdecision. 323 All that can be said for certain is that the Court, at a minimum,endorsed a fairly traditional understanding of marriage and meant to rejectrace-based obstacles to its enjoyment. 324Advocates' implicit suggestion that Justice Traynor's majority opinion inPerez has more to offer on the question of what marriage means today hasmerit. Admittedly, as Moran notes, it is no more likely that Traynor wrote hisPerez opinion with same-sex couples in mind than it is that the Loving Courtthought about the Goodridge plaintiffs when it liberated Mildred and RichardLoving from their forced exile from their native Virginia.325 Still, Traynoroffers an account of marriage and the problems inherent in identity-basedrestrictions on it that resonates today.326 In contrast to Loving, both the equalprotection and due process dimensions of Perez are fairly well developed.327Traynor's discussion of social science research on race and contention that\"[h]uman beings are bereft of worth and dignity by a doctrine that would make320.

Safely,331 which, in holding that prison regulationsprohibiting inmates to marry in the absence of an official determination thatcompelling reasons for the marriage existed were unconstitutional, recognizedmarriages as \"expressions of emotional support and public commitment.\" 332 Itis also arguably in line with the Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas.333While Lawrence concerned criminal prohibitions on gay sex that reached intothe private sphere, not marriage per se, many scholars have read it to be moreabout human \"dignity and equal respect for people involved in intimaterelationships,\" whether they be private or public.334Perez helps give content to \"the freedom to marry\"335 in the twenty-firstCentury; it sheds light on the public and private dimensions of modemmarriage 336 and the citizenship or public standing that marriage confers.337328.

If nothing else, as Moran notes, it \"remains farand away the single most important way in which the government recognizesand supports intimate relationships. '\" 339 Whatever one thinks of the institutionof marriage or the state's role in it, the choice to marry still means something,perhaps even more today than it did sixty years ago, when Andrea andSylvester won the right to wed, because people-given the many other viableoptions for organizing one's intimate life now available-no longer have tomarry to lead fulfilling, economically stable lives. Indeed, as Perezunderscores, it may well be in the choosing-whether it occurs for love, as inAndrea and Sylvester's case, or more practical reasons-that an individualasserts his or her individual autonomy, needs, hopes, and desires.Deciding to marry also conveys a message about the particularrelationship being formalized. For many, marriage is \"the authentic marker of aserious and committed love relationship; a symbolic rite of passage intoadulthood. 3 40 Even where this is not the case, though, getting marriedcommunicates something about how an individual and his or her relationshipshould be legally, socially, and politically regarded. For better or worse, it sayssomething about where people stand in the community.34 12. Identity-Policing and Constraints on BelongingQueer theorists have bemoaned the emphasis increasingly placed onsecuring marriage for same-sex couples within the gay and lesbiancommunity. 342 For example, Katherine Franke has argued that \"[w]hat we arewitnessing in the gay community ... is a radical substitution or transformationof the nature of homosexual desire. Into the psychic space created bydecriminalization [of homosexual intimacy under Lawrence] has rushed adesire for governance, a desire for recognition-recognition by legal and state2096 (concluding that \"the 'right to marry' entails both some right of intimate association in theprivate sphere and... an individual right of access to the official institution of marriage\").337.

The dejure refusal to all gay people to satisfy this desire has formedthe basis of the new civil rights claims made on behalf of 'the community.'343Her concern, shared by others, is that the social inclusion sought by advocateswill be contingent upon the domestication and taming of nonnormative sexualidentities.344 As proof of the price tag she thinks marriage is likely to carry forthe LGBT community, Franke points to the experience of newly freedmen andwomen during Reconstruction. 345 For these individuals, who had lacked thelegal capacity to enter into marriages during slavery, \"[t]he right to marryfigured prominently among the bundle of rights African Americans held dear inthe postbellum years.\" 346 Franke notes that legal marriage was understood to bean important vehicle for the realization of black citizenship, but argues that itproved to be a mechanism by which that citizenship was also \"managed inAfrican Americans.\" 347 Freedpersons were often severely punished for anynoncompliance with the social norms and practices attending civil marriage.348I do not contest the notion that, as a society, we benefit from having avariety of models and alternatives for intimate associations from whichindividuals can freely choose to express their essential selves. 349 While civilunions and domestic partnerships adopted by many jurisdictions as analternative to same-sex marriage have been properly criticized by many,350 onemight find that, as time goes on, these legal arrangement become a desirable343.

Despite what Perez's non-recognition mightordinarily suggest, this \"lost\" case has the potential significantly to advanceour thinking about race, gender, and marriage.38 2Perez certainly helps to explicate some of the parallels that exist betweenthe experiences of people affected by both antimiscegenation and same-sexmarriage bans. My goal in this article, however, has been to moveconversations about both antimiscegenation laws and limits on same-sexmarriage \"beyond analogy,\" to a place focused less on the extent to which thoseadvancing claims for justice can be fit easily into familiar racial or gendercategories than on the nature of the actual injustice at stake.377.

Heatherton, et al., eds., 2000).; see alsoLenhardt, Understanding the Mark, supra note 18, at 805-47 (discussing problem of stigma in therace context). It may be that not everyone affected by these state bans will experience exclusionfrom marriage as a personal injury. See Franke, Longing for Loving, supra note 344 (arguing thatLawrence and current period of non-regulation of lgbt intimate relationships should be seen as anopportunity, rather than an injury). This does not, however, diminish the significance of the harmfor those who do or address the larger question of whether the government can constitutionallytreat individuals in this way.378.

Elsewhere, I have noted that Perez could be extremely useful in helping scholars thinkabout cross-racial interactions, not only in the area of romance and intimate relations, but also interms of political and economic coalition building between African Americans and Latinos on arange of issues, including racial equality, work, education, and immigration.

A close look at the purposeand effects of government identity-policing in both the antimiscegenation andsame-sex marriage contexts can lead to productive changes in the debate aboutthe place of marriage in modem society and the citizenship rights of gay menand lesbians. This is particularly true when one considers that the identity-policing the government has carried on in these areas is neither equal nor383neutral. Ultimately, it serves as an important tool for separating out the \"bad\"citizens form the \"good,\" for placing gay men and lesbians firmly on themargins of society.384The California Supreme Court's recent, Perez-informed decision in In reMarriage Cases suggests that this harsh reality is becoming more and moredifficult to ignore. I am optimistic that this decision also signals that theexpansive understanding of marriage and citizenship that I advance in thisArticle will one day become widely accepted. But, even if this view nevercarries the day, it is my hope that, at a minimum, the suggestions for reframingthe debate about marriage that I offer here will help to pave the way for moreopen and honest assessments of the true implications and citizenship costs ofrace and gender-based impediments to the selection of \"the person of one'schoice\" for marriage.385383.

    "abstract": "Conversations about the constitutionality of prohibitions on marriage for same-sex couples invariably reduce to the question of whether a meaningful analogy can be drawn between restrictions on same-sex marriage and antimiscegenation laws. In an effort to refocus this debate, this article considers the California Supreme Court\\u27s 1948 decision in Perez v. Sharp and its use by advocates in recent litigation to secure marriage rights for gay and lesbian couples. Opponents of marriage rights for members of the LGBT *840 community frequently assert that dispatching Perez in these cases distorts the meaning of that decision and other similar precedents by drawing a false analogy between bans on interracial and same-sex marriage. Professor Lenhardt argues that, instead, Perez\\u27s appearance in recent cases helps to clarify the nature of the marriage rights at stake in Loving v. Virginia. She also contends that the strategic use of Perez serves to underscore the extent to which state antimiscegenation laws established not only racial, but also gender-based identity norms. Finally, Professor Lenhardt asserts that Perez\\u27s use in recent marriage cases offers a way out of the “analogy” debate, focusing discussion on the nature and substantive effect of race and gender bars on marriage, rather than on a comparison of the groups seeking judicial redress for such restrictions. Professor Lenhardt concludes that a deeper appreciation of the extent to which state-imposed obstacles to marriage have operated to police identity, restrict opportunities for self-definition, and impede belonging can elucidate the true implications and citizenship effects of prohibitions on marriage for same-sex couples",
