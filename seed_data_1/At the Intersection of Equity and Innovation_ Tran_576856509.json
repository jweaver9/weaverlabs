IntroductionIn 2016, the Vancouver City Council passed theSupporting Trans* Equality and an Inclusive Vancouvermotion (also referred to here as the Supporting Trans*Equality policy or TGD2S strategy), a strategy that aims tomake the City of Vancouver a safer place for Two‐Spirit,trans, and gender‐diverse (TGD2S) people who seek ser‐vices and work. For a group of people whose encoun‐ters with city services are often shaped by exclusion,harassment, and discrimination (Vancouver Board ofParks and Recreation, 2014, p. 8), this strategy was aremarkable achievement. Its purpose—to ensure thatmunicipal programs, services, and physical spaces aresafe and accessible to TGD2S users (whether residents,visitors, or City staff)—stands in stark contrast to themyr‐iad anti‐trans laws and policies that have proliferated inNorth America and beyond during the same period. Forthe City of Vancouver, the Supporting Trans* Equalitypolicy demonstrated the City’s local and global leader‐ship in working toward creating meaningful pathways toinclusion (City of Vancouver, 2016, p. 9).TGD2S people are often grouped with lesbian, gay,bisexual, and queer communities under the LGBTQ2S+acronym; however, these groups share overlappingbut distinct concerns and needs. While municipalitieshave acknowledged the “LGBQ” part of the acronym,or sexual diversity, in an uneven fashion (Bain &Podmore, 2021), the acknowledgment of gender diver‐sity is even more scarce (a gap that is replicated inthe literature). The Supporting Trans* Equality policyis unique in its intervention for gender‐diverse com‐munities: Trans, which refers to people whose genderidentity is different from their assigned sex; genderUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 223–234 223diverse (including non‐binary), which includes peoplewhose gender expressions and identities do not con‐form to a male/female gender binary; and Two‐Spirit,who are Indigenous and whose gender identity is bothmale/female, masculine/feminine (Hunt, 2016). TGD2Speople face persistent discrimination when trying toaccess even the most basic municipal services. Considerthe following scenarios: Trying to participate in recre‐ational programming with a preferred name and beingrefused because this name does not align with legalidentification; or, wanting to use a change room thatalignswith one’s gender identity and facing hostility fromboth staff and other recreation centre users when thateffort fails. In these scenarios, each of these “sites” ofCity services—programming, spaces, signage, forms, andstaff training—contain potential barriers that, shaped bybinary gender norms, work to exclude residents, staff,and visitors.At the same time, TGD2S voices have been histori‐cally absent from the planning table and there have beenfew avenues through which TGD2S people have beeninvited to participate in shaping urban futures. Whileappreciating TGD2S lives through a strengths‐based lensis vital to resisting damage‐centred narratives (Nash,2010; Todd, 2021; Tuck, 2009), it is also necessary tounderstand the everyday impacts of anti‐trans hostility.As Kline et al. (2023) write, trans people experience awide range of physical andmental health disparities com‐pared to a cisgender population. These disparities, theynote, “exist in a social context of stigma and social exclu‐sion” (Kline et al., 2023, p. 2) alongside a sharp increasein anti‐trans legislation, particularly in the US and the UK(Kinney et al., 2022).In British Columbia, gender identity and expressionare protected grounds under the provincial human rightscode. This amendment, made in 2016, was character‐ized as necessary for clarity of interpretation about thetypes of discrimination TGD2S people face, and to beconsistent with human rights legislation across Canada(“B.C. Human Rights Code,” 2016). As human rightslawyer Laura Track writes for the BC Human RightsClinic: “The inclusion of gender identity and expressionin the Codemeans that employers, landlords, and serviceproviders must act to prevent and respond to discrim‐ination against trans people” (Track, 2020, para. 5) Formunicipalities, as employers, service providers and occa‐sionally landlords, enacting policy to support trans inclu‐sion aligns with a broader policy landscape. Moreover,policy that directly confronts discrimination and aims “toprotect and expand resources and opportunities” worksalongside legal human rights protections to change socialnorms (Kinney et al., 2022, p. 493). Yet, few municipali‐ties have addressed trans inclusion explicitly.This article explores the origin and policy‐relatedimpacts of one such intervention in the City of Vancouver.I tell the story of the Supporting Trans* Equality pol‐icy driven by two questions: What was the policy devel‐opment process of the TGD2S strategy? And what, ifany, policy‐related impacts have the TGD2S strategy had?The aim of this article is twofold. The first goal is to doc‐ument this policy as a contribution to the urban policyand planning literature, where attention to gender diver‐sity is due. Second, using the TGD2S strategy, I showhow a municipal equity policy aimed at addressing thesafety and inclusion of TGD2S people can have significantimpacts beyond its immediate scope. To develop thisidea, I consider how equity policy can serve as an innova‐tion tool: I link literature on equity and urban innovationin municipal governance to illustrate how one inclusionstrategy can substantially reshape institutional practices.The path of the article is as follows. An explanationof methods is followed by a snapshot of the SupportingTrans* Equality policy, which is couched in a discussionof how I understand and approach trans inclusion in thecontext of municipal policy and planning. Then, I exploretwo sets of literature—equity and urban innovation atthe municipal scale—as a conceptual framework to sup‐port a subsequent, more thorough discussion of theTGD2S strategy: Its origins, its adoption, and the out‐comes that have emerged from the ways this policy hasbecome embedded into the broader organizational man‐date of the City. Using this conceptual lens, I considerhow an equity strategy can function as innovation by sub‐stantially reshaping institutional practices for the benefitof everyone, including its intended target.2. MethodsThis analysis was developed through an examination ofopen‐source documents available through the City ofVancouver’s website. I used four search functions avail‐able through the City’s website: A general search fea‐ture; a “find Council documents” function; an “infor‐mation from in‐camera meetings” search feature; andthe archived web contents available on the Archive‐Itsite. These tools allowed me to create a database ofmore than 30 relevant policy and strategy documentsfrom the years 2013–2022: These include seven admin‐istrative reports, nine memoranda and correspondencedocuments, multiple sets of meeting minutes from thePark Board and Council that focus on TGD2S and relatedstrategies, four municipal budget and five‐year serviceplans, advisory committee terms of reference, annualreports, working plans, andweb pages (for a partial list ofdocuments used in this analysis see Table 1). All of thesedocumentswere publicly available, and no retrieval assis‐tance from City staff or advisory members was sought.Supporting supplementary materials, such as media cov‐erage of outcomes that emerged from the TGD2S strat‐egy, were also added to the database. These documentswere reviewed and coded using an inductive coding pro‐cess (Saldaña, 2013).Since the focus of this article is to tell a story aboutthe trajectory of a policy and its policy‐related effects,I present the story of trans inclusion from one angle thatsticks closely to the data presented in staff reports andUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 223–234 224Table 1.

This is neither an exhaus‐tive approach, nor is it without limitations. Notably, thisstory does not give voice to TGD2S staff or residentsabout their perspective of policy implementation andimpact. TGD2S voices included here are those who weredocumented during the process of policy development.Likewise, there is no attention paid here to the relation‐ship between trans‐inclusion policy development andthe role of the Vancouver Police Department as a stake‐holder in the city process. While the Vancouver PoliceDepartment did not play a central role in the TGD2S strat‐egy, they participated in limited consultations throughtheir role as an affiliate institution. Many TGD2S peo‐ple, especially racialized TGD2S communities, have alearned distrust of police as a result of persistent nega‐tive encounters (Lee & Santiago, 2023). Given these rela‐tions, it is likely that some TGD2S people would not feelwelcome to participate in a policy development processwhere the Vancouver Police Departmentmay be present.This question is worth exploring but it is outside thescope of this article.3. Trans Inclusion and the TGD2S StrategyThe origin story of the TGD2S strategy began with poli‐cies and actions undertaken for trans inclusion in 2014by the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation (alsoreferred to as Park Board) and the Vancouver Board ofEducation (also referred to as School Board), two orga‐nizations whose jurisdictions and operations have finan‐cial attachments to the City but operate independently intheir decision‐making. Both pursued a path tomake theirorganizations more welcoming and inclusive. In the caseof the School Board, this path was contentious: Duringthe consultation to update their anti‐discrimination pol‐icy, angry opposition resulted from efforts to protectLGBTQ students, staff, and families and address transand gender‐diverse members of the school community(Leung, 2017). For the Park Board, the story was differ‐ent. In 2013, the Park Board voted unanimously to strikea working group “to provide a report to the VancouverBoard of Parks and Recreation detailing how Vancouvercan be the world’s most inclusive jurisdiction for transand gender‐variant communities” (Vancouver Board ofParks and Recreation, 2013, p. 3). The content of thereport returned to the Park Board in 2014 is detailedfurther on; it became the basis for the TGD2S strategy,which sought to scale up the work begun by the Parkand School Boards. Accepted by the Council in June 2016,the actions contained in the strategy require the munici‐pal government to attend to and redesign implicitly gen‐dered models of service, programs, and spaces.Indeed, the assumption of binary gender is part ofthe municipal fabric: It is encoded in municipal data col‐lection forms, building codes, signage, and communica‐tion strategies. For a staff person, resident, or visitorwhose gender identity or presentation does not alignor is not read by others as conforming with dominantmodes ofmasculinity and femininity, trying to access pro‐grams, services, and spaces can be alienating or worse.A common sentiment from TGD2S respondents whowere surveyed about their park usage was avoidance.Urban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 223–234 226One respondent stated: “I frequently avoid going tothe gym or going swimming if I don’t have a friendwith me, due to fears of being confronted/harassedin the change rooms” (Vancouver Board of Parks andRecreation, 2014, p. 15). Many who are welcomed underan LGBTQ umbrella may face similar issues, but the chal‐lenges posed by binary gender illustrate the specificneeds of TGD2S communities that “are all too oftenerased from supposedly ‘LGBTQ’ struggles” (Browneet al., 2021, p. 4).What does TGD2S inclusion mean? Conceptually,I approach TGD2S inclusion from the perspective of gen‐der and sexual citizenship, which refers to the embod‐ied experiences, discourses, and material practices ofinclusion and exclusion for certain bodies on the basisof adhering to or rejecting gender and sexual norms.Exclusion can thus take the shape of policies and prac‐tices (for instance, forms with limited categories) or beexperienced as a repetition of the message “you don’tbelong here.” In other words, the state is not the onlyentity with the power to enforce inclusion and exclu‐sion. Importantly, this captures the everyday experienceof discrimination faced by trans and gender‐diverse peo‐ple. When engaged about access to park board spaces,one respondent stated: “I am constantly being told thatthe washroom I am in is a women’s washroom. I am agay, young, androgynous female. These changes are nec‐essary….We all go into any toilet to do the same thing”(Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation, 2014, p. 29).Inclusion often implies a rights‐based framework;indeed, exclusion on the basis of gender identity andexpression contravenes a person’s human rights inBritish Columbia and Canada. A rights‐based frameworkis complicated for several reasons, however. First, therationale for assigning rights is often tied to claims forsocial justice and recognition as a “class” deserving ofrights. Yet, recognition necessarily requires inclusion andexclusion criteria (Bain & Podmore, 2021, p. 1647). In asystem predicated on a gender binary, the emphasishas been on drawing boundaries around who fits withina deserving class (women, for example). The upshot isthat “gender fluidity becomes further silenced throughlegal and social policies around trans* that reproducetraditional frameworks that foreground authentic binarygender” (Hines & Santos, 2018, p. 39). This has nega‐tive consequences for trans people,whose “authenticity”may be called into question. It also has negative conse‐quences for gender‐diverse, non‐binary, and Two‐Spiritpeople who simply do not fit into this framework.Despite these complexities, the focus on rights is animportant strategy. Hostility toward TGD2S people hasbeen on the rise (Kinney et al., 2022; Kline et al., 2023).Nash and Browne (2021, p. 87), for instance, documentwhat they term hetero‐activist resistances in schools inCanada and the UK: They show that inclusion of, andsupport for, sexual orientation and gender identity learn‐ing resources “is actively contested.” In British Columbia,this takes the form of parents and candidates for schoolboards organizing around the idea that sexual orienta‐tion and gender identity content is a trend of the day(MacDonald & Little, 2022) rather than a human rightsissue. At the same time, rights have a significant impacton people’s everyday lives. Earle et al. (2021, p. 864)show from a survey of 77 countries that “living in an envi‐ronment that legally supports LGBT communities is asso‐ciated with more personal LGBT rights support,” evenwhen people have no personal connection to membersof queer or gender diverse communities.At the City of Vancouver, the TGD2S strategy is under‐stood as an equity‐related Council directive, one of manythat emerged prior to—and paved the way for—theadoption of the city‐wide Equity Framework in 2021.The Equity Framework (City of Vancouver, 2021a, p. 8)also understands rights to be salient: Compliance withthe law on human rights and safe workplaces is one ofthree “imperatives for action towards equity.” However,across the internally‐facing staff memos and externally‐facing reports to Council, supporting trans inclusion isalso framed as setting the City in a leadership role andlaying a path “that will be of great benefit” not onlyto TGD2S communities but to organizations, communityagencies, and electeds at all levels of government (City ofVancouver, 2016, p. 3). This framing is suggestive of thebroader policy impact the TGD2S strategy has had.In the next section, I develop a theoretical frameworkusing literature on equity and urban innovation in munic‐ipal governance to explore the question of whether orhow an equity intervention can also serve as an innova‐tion tool. Ultimately, I place this scholarship into conver‐sation with a more in‐depth look at the origins and out‐comes of the TGD2S strategy to consider the significanceof this strategy on policy within and beyond the scope ofthe City of Vancouver.4. Equity and/as InnovationAs Loh and Kim (2021) write, the issue of equity is cen‐tral to the practice of planning. Although equity suffersfrom a lack of consistent definition (Cairney et al., 2022),it is typically understood as access in two directions:Access resulting from equitable distribution of resourcesand services on the one hand, and, on the other, pro‐cedural access that transforms the who and the how ofdecision‐making. Joy and Vogel (2021) further describethese two directions of equity with an intersectional lens,underlining the multidimensional experience of socialdifference and oppression:Equity ensures that human beings in all their inter‐secting personal, familial, sociopolitical, and geo‐graphic differences have access to the opportuni‐ties, resources, and supports they need to surviveand thrive. Simultaneously, equity requires that weunderstand and address the ideational systems andsocio‐political practices that block access for particu‐lar groups. (Joy & Vogel, 2021, p. 1376)Urban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 223–234 227Notably, equity is defined in relation to—and distinctfrom—equality. Whereas equality is recognized as same‐ness (all people have access to the same opportuni‐ties, for instance), equity is recognized as addressingsystemic barriers that impede access to opportunities.The move from equality to equity in Canadian munic‐ipal frameworks is a trend that has occurred in thepast twenty years; as such, strategies dating from theearly 2000s often used the term equality (most often inrelation to gender). It is important to note that equityframeworks (unlike equality, when used in law) are notlegally binding.Given that the distribution of public assets is a cen‐tral feature of planning, attention to who has accessto resources and services is critical, as are efforts toexpand opportunities for those who have less accessbecause of historical and contemporary forms of exclu‐sion (Loh & Kim, 2021, p. 182). However, there is tensionbetween equity, diversity, and democracy in both theoryand practice, as Fainstein (2010) reminds us. To cite oneexample, creating opportunities for participatory gover‐nance does not by definition translate into greater partic‐ipation for historically excluded communities (Fainstein,2010; Flyvbjerg, 1998). This is demonstrably shown in thecase studies co‐created for Black urban placemaker JayPitter’s graduate course: She and her co‐authors revealthe myriad barriers that prevent Black and other histor‐ically marginalized communities from fully engaging incivic participation, despite any increase in the numberof participation opportunities (see Pitter, 2021). Even asit is complicated to implement equity in planning prac‐tice (Brand, 2015; Loh et al., 2022), recent commitmentsto examining equity within and outside the planningprofession in Canada (Canadian Institute of Planners,2021; Federation of Canadian Municipalities [FCM], n.d.)demonstrate that there is evermore attention to the rolethat equity plays in planning.As such, addressing equity has become part of amunicipality’s work in the Canadian context. In BritishColumbia, local governments are responsible, in part orin full, for providing land use decisions and other coreservices. However, all local governments in Canada oper‐ate under provincial legislation; in practice, this meansthat their decision‐making power and capacity to raisemoney are constrained. Regardless, many municipal gov‐ernments have taken leadership positions on files—likeequity—that are not historically part of their core ser‐vices mandate. Given that cities are the scale at whichthe disproportionate impacts of housing insecurity, vio‐lence, and employment precarity become most visible(Klodawsky et al., 2017, p. 4), local governments areincreasingly asked to address a broader range of issues(Mévellec et al., 2020). In their exploration of innovationand inclusion within Canadian municipal governance,Bradford and Bramwell (2014) show that some citieshave rejected the idea that provincial governments dic‐tate their capacity to shape their own futures. In thesecases, cities have taken on what they understand to bean “enhanced policy role” whose process is “centredin, and responsive to, the local community” (Tindal &Tindal, 2009, p. 392, as cited in Bradford & Bramwell,2014, p. 320).Equity should thus be recognized as an essential fea‐ture of municipal responsiveness. The Equity Frameworkidentifies three reasons for the timeliness of this inter‐vention (City of Vancouver, 2021b): Justice (addressinghistorical and systematic oppression), compliance (con‐forming to provincial and federal human rights codes),and effectiveness (recognizing the workplace benefits ofhiring, retaining, and promoting diverse staff). However,the question of the shape or implementation of equityand inclusion is discussed in the scholarly literature incritical terms. Scholars note the discrepancy betweenaspirational commitments and operationalized enact‐ments of equity. Sustainability and resilience planningillustrates this problem; according to Loh and Kim (2021,p. 138), critiques of this field have shown how equity ismentioned but is not incorporated into actionable pol‐icy and planning. Andrew and Doloreux (2014, p. 138)also identify that social development initiatives like inclu‐sion suffer whenmunicipalities functionwith limited hor‐izontal coordination across departments. This is echoedin Bain and Podmore’s (2021) examination of the inclu‐sion of sexuality and gender diversity in municipal gover‐nance. They argue: “Social issues are often siloed withinthe mandates of specific committees with limited inter‐sectional crossover” (Bain & Podmore, 2021, p. 1660).Finally, the scholarship notes thatwhere equity and inclu‐sion are understood as exclusively social developmentinitiatives, there is little integration between these strate‐gies and other areas of city business, like economic devel‐opment (Andrew& Doloreux, 2014), except when equitycan be framed in terms of advancing economic goals (Loh& Kim, 2021).Where equity goals have been advanced in localgovernment, scholars identify divergent reasons for thisoutcome. Davis and Edge (2022, pp. 14–15) write thatwell‐defined goals are key but the conjoined efforts ofstrategically‐minded local activists and politicians areeven more central. By contrast, Liao et al. (2019) findthat equity is dependent on interdepartmental collabora‐tion and an emphasis on procedural justice, like residentparticipation. Whitzman et al.’s (2014, p. 444) argumentthat “four legs for a good table” is essential for deliveringimprovements to women’s safety brings these two viewstogether in some ways: They argue that the four legs, orthe combination of electeds, public servants, communitygroup advocates, and (academic) researchers, is neededto create change that promotes equity and inclusion.Could such advancements be considered innovative?Certainly, equity interventions developed through a pro‐cess of co‐design meet several criteria laid out by schol‐arship about innovation in the public sector. Defininginnovation as an “intentional and proactive processthat involves the generation and practical adoption andspread of new and creative ideas, which aim to produceUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 223–234 228a qualitative change in a specific context,” Sørensenand Torfing (2011, p. 849) argue that networked col‐laboration with multiple stakeholders can enhance pub‐lic innovation. These authors emphasize that innovationis not “business as usual” but with more efficiencies.Rather, innovation is second‐ or third‐order change thatupends routines or transforms theways problems or poli‐cies are understood (Sørensen & Torfing, 2011, p. 850).Innovatory urban governance as framed byMcGuirk et al.(2022, p. 1392) is similarly interested in imagining adifferent set of practices, motivated by responsivenessand experimentation, and emphasizing “multi‐sectoralco‐design and collaboration.” Although there is not aconsistent set of features associated with innovatoryurban governance, what is common across its multipleforms is a defiance of the rigid, hierarchical structureand anti‐risk behaviour for which bureaucratic traditionis known (Criado et al., 2021) and an urge for collectivelydriven transformation (McGuirk et al., 2022, p. 1396).Taking up the idea of collaboration in innovation, par‐ticularly in terms of policy co‐design, Blomkamp (2018,p. 66) notes that problem definition—and solutionsideation—will be improved from the participation ofa greater diversity of participants throughout the pol‐icymaking process. Here, improvement implies that agreater diversity of needs is met. This is an important con‐sideration for valuing innovation: As Shearmur and Poirier(2017) argue, it is not just economic logic or marketcompetition that drives innovation for local governments.Rather, municipalities support innovative ideas whenthey address goals like “solving practical problems asso‐ciated with material aspects of municipal responsibility”(Shearmur & Poirier, 2017, p. 741). In this sense, collabo‐ration on issues like equity initiatives could be understoodas an innovative response to an emergent challenge.Notably, participatory governance has already playedan important role in guiding equity initiatives in Canadianmunicipalities. Ottawa’s City for All Women Initiative(CAWI), for instance, has worked since the early 2000sboth inside and outside municipal government to shapethe development and adoption of equity tools for munic‐ipal practitioners (Andrew & Doloreux, 2014; Siltanenet al., 2015). What is unique to CAWI is the way theyconducted this work both within and outside City Hall:Their ability to maintain a link (an office or staff liaison)in City Hall while also retaining their community pro‐file has meant that they have been able to draw in afar more diverse set of community members than thosewho would normally participate in community engage‐ment exercises (Siltanen et al., 2015). Seen through theframework of innovation, this model of collaboration ishugely important. Without attracting diverse voices, col‐laboration will lead to stasis instead of innovation, par‐ticularly when collaborations occur “in closed and stablenetworks” and in forums where power dynamics are leftunattended (Sørensen & Torfing, 2011, p. 853).Sørensen and Torfing (2011, p. 853) go on to notethat, with careful management, collaboration can be fun‐damental to innovation. Considerations for such man‐agement include recognition of community knowledgeand expertisewhere, as an avenue for procedural democ‐racy, community members are invited to redefine exist‐ing terms of engagement (Corburn, 2003). Co‐design ofequity interventions presents a significant opportunityfor innovation, then, if those who have been historicallyexcluded from planning and decision‐making are invitedinto a meaningful collaborative process.As Bain and Podmore (2021) show, the applicationof diversity and inclusion policies to LGBTQ2S commu‐nities is uneven in many Canadian municipalities. Theirstudy reveals civic ambivalence toward including sexualand gender diversity in suburban municipal social inclu‐sion efforts; this agrees with my own findings about awelcoming and inclusive city policy in a small city con‐text (Muller Myrdahl, 2017). Yet, the current equity land‐scape seems to be shifting in several important ways,at least in British Columbia. For one, it is supported atmultiple scales, so municipal policies are in conversa‐tion with the provincial and federal expectation to applyGBA+ (gender‐based analysis plus) to all aspects of gov‐ernance. Second, the current focus on equity is arguablymore politically engaged than earlier iterations of eithergender equality strategies or diversity and inclusion ini‐tiatives, which were heavily influenced by a mandateformulticultural (immigrant) recognition and integration.The language used in current iterations of equity is moreovertly political, acknowledging, for example, the waystructural inequality is foundational to North Americanurban development.The fact that municipal equity efforts are no longerlimited to a few select cities also sets current equityefforts apart, as does the fact that equity made itonto the 2022 agenda of municipal priorities set bythe FCM, the organization that works at the federalscale on behalf of local governments. The 2022 agendaacknowledged inclusion as a long‐held priority that wasreaffirmed through the adoption of its anti‐racism andequity commitment statement (FCM, 2022, n.d.). Thisstatement commits the organization to rectify inequitiesby “grounding our culture, systems, policies and prac‐tices in an intersectional, anti‐racism and equity lens”(FCM, n.d.). How this will become actionable remainsto be seen, but it finally responds to a long‐standingcall by historically marginalized communities to take seri‐ously the inequities built into urban form and process(Pitter, 2020).Taken together, the scholarly and applied consider‐ations of equity in Canadian municipalities, read along‐side approaches to innovation in urban governance, pro‐vide a framework to analyze the TGD2S strategy. In thenext section, I draw from the database of the ParkBoard and City documents to tell the story of its originsand give an overview of its outcomes. Then, I read theTGD2S strategy through this lens of equity and/as inno‐vation to interpret the role and policy‐related impacts ofthis intervention.Urban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 223–234 2295. Origins and Outcomes of the TGD2S StrategyFormal inclusion of TGD2S people in the governanceof the City of Vancouver began with the introductionof the City’s (then‐titled) LGBTQ Advisory Committee in2009 (Murray, 2015). As a volunteer‐driven city advisory,the committee provides staff and council with input onissues relevant to City business. Under their terms ofreference, advisory committees must develop an annualwork plan with specific priorities, supported through thework of subcommittees. In the 2013 LGBTQ Advisory,the Trans and Gender Variant Inclusion Working Group(TGVIWG) was initiated (Murray, 2015, p. 60) to workwith the Park Board on priority one of its newly‐developed strategic framework: To create parks andrecreation for all. In May 2013, the TGVIWG was consti‐tuted as a working group of the Park Board (VancouverBoard of Parks and Recreation, 2013).Tasked with reporting back on barriers to accessand recommended changes, the TGVIWG conducted anextensive, nearly year‐long consultation process thatincluded town hall meetings, surveys, focus groups, andother activities in two phases. First, they sought broadcommunity engagement with TGD2S community mem‐bers and allies, community centre frontline and aquaticstaff, City Project Managers, recreation centre users, andcommunity partners. Second, they refined their findingsin a community review phase, seeking feedback fromTGD2S community members and allies, frontline staff,andother City advisory groups (Vancouver Board of Parksand Recreation, 2014). Each phase involved contact withmore than 200 people, many of whom shared intimatestories of challenges they, or their friends and lovedones, faced when using Park Board services and facilities.One story exemplifies the experiences collected: In it,a parent recounted how their gender creative child feltunwelcome and out of place at park programs. The par‐ent wrote:She chooses day camps, like any kid does, based onwhere she feels safe and welcome….If staff and chil‐dren respect Kate’s right to her gender expression andare interested in her as a multifaceted young person,it’s a thumbs up. Unfortunately, a series of bad experi‐ences havemade her extremelywary of all‐day camps.Today she is very clear she does not feel safe at com‐munity centre day camps. (Vancouver Board of Parksand Recreation, 2014, p. 27)Kate’s experiences sum up inaccessibility: At a city‐runcommunity centre, where programming should be com‐paratively low cost and available to all, some kids feelunsafe and that they don’t belong. These encounters setthe bar for what young people (and their parents) cometo expect of municipal‐led services.The outcome of this participatory process was asixty‐four‐page report presented to the Park Board inApril 2014 (Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation,2014). The report (abbreviated here to Building aPath) outlined seventy‐seven recommendations aimingto improve access for TGD2S residents “to green spaces,active living, and community provided by the Park Board”(Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation, 2014, p. 1).The recommendations were organized into six areas,each designated under one of the three directions ofthe Park Board’s strategic framework. The six areas were:Public space and signage; programming; financial acces‐sibility; community partnerships; forms and literature;and human resources and training. Recommendationsincluded increasing the number of single‐user changeareas, piloting recreational programs specific to TGD2Sresidents, adjusting the gender category options on ParkBoard forms, and developing and implementing trainingmaterials and programs for staff at all levels.This report was the foundation for a host of changesmade through the Park Board, with City support: In otherwords, the City was implicated in making the neces‐sary facilities modifications. While Council had alreadymade Vancouver the first Canadian municipality to passa municipal building code provision for gender‐neutralwashrooms in public buildings (in September 2013), theBuilding a Path report set the stage for an implementa‐tion strategy of signage, education, and services to makeVancouver parks and community centres more welcom‐ing to TGD2S users. The most eye‐catching part of thisstrategy, launched in March 2015, was an awarenesscampaign in the form of highly visible posters (approx‐imately four feet tall) on display at community centresfeaturing pictures of, and statements by, TGD2S people(and in one case, a youth with their parents; Hallett,2015; TheGeorgia Straight, 2015; “Vancouver Park Boardlaunches,” 2015). By September 2016, the TGVIWG hadestablished a steering committee with Park Board staff,completed signage guidelines (using text and functionalicons rather than gendered symbols for washrooms),revised pilot programming (moving to trans swim insteadof trans inclusive public swim), and identified a list of pri‐ority next steps (including training and policies).With the Park Board implementation in progress,Council passed the Supporting Trans* Equality and anInclusive Vancouver motion in 2015 and tasked staffwith assessing how the TGVIWG recommendations couldbe brought into the scope of City services, facilities,and operations (TransFocus Consulting & Equity Labs inCity of Vancouver, 2016, p. 3, Appendix A). The con‐sultants who won the bid to develop the proposal hadbeen involved in the TGVIWG and were thus intimatelyfamiliar with the existing asks and possible directions.Submitted to Council in July 2016, the TGD2S strat‐egy laid out fourteen recommendations with thirty‐onesub‐recommendations, almost all of which built uponthe existing work in the Park Board (and updatesundertaken by the School Board). Like Building a Path,the TGD2S strategy was organized into thematic pil‐lars: Public space, facilities + signage; programs + ser‐vices; human resources; communications + data; andUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 223–234 230community consultation + public partnerships. In addi‐tion to recommendations under each pillar, five quickstarts—action items that could be completed within sixto eighteen months—were identified, with attention tohigh impact and feasibility for financial and operationalimplementation (TransFocus Consulting & Equity Labs inCity of Vancouver, 2016, p. 16, Appendix A). The subse‐quent changeswere as substantive as the Building a Pathimplementation, but with a wider reach. Several of thesechanges and their policy impacts are discussed below.6. DiscussionThrough the review of documents, two elements areimmediately noticeable. The first is the scope of changeacross the municipal government. The TGD2S strategyis neither siloed nor is it limited to social policy andprogramming. Rather, the strategy has been taken upacross the organization. The most obvious example iswashrooms. Starting from the focus on Park Board wash‐rooms in the Building a Path recommendations, theTGD2S strategy fostered a complete overhaul of both sig‐nage and washroom access in City‐owned or City‐leasedbuildings. As of the 2019 update, this includes signageat twenty‐seven community centres, nearly eighty field‐housewashrooms (in parks), and at least five civic admin‐istration buildings or City‐leased properties where Citystaff work (City of Vancouver, 2019b, p. A‐1).Two other examples provide a clear sense of scope.Part of the human resources pillar, a staff and man‐agement training initiative identified that “over 1000Engineering Services employees received training in2018” (City of Vancouver, 2019b, p. 7).While the report’semphasis was on the number of staff trained, it is equallyremarkable to reflect on the content of the training:City‐wide, staff are being educated about TGD2S livesand gender diversity, which historically is not typical ofmunicipal staff training. A second illustration is data col‐lection and reporting. The communications + data pillarincluded the recommendation to create and use data col‐lectionmethods that include TGD2Speople across all Citydepartments,with sub‐recommendations stipulating theneed for (a) consistent policy and protocol for collect‐ing gender data and (b) clear standards for conductingTGD2S‐inclusive analysis and reporting. As both an inter‐nal and external practice that underpins a wide varietyof City work, revising data collection practices is a signif‐icant undertaking that has important consequences forTGD2S visibility and inclusion (Doan, 2016). By 2019, thePark Board program registration system was updated toremove gender as a required category (City of Vancouver,2019b, p. 8), and by 2020, considerable changes hadbeen made to internal and external data‐gathering prac‐tices. Specifically, following the creation of an inventoryof internal forms that collect binary gender data, all Citydepartments were engaged in an exercise to identifywhen and how data related to gender would be collected(City of Vancouver, 2020, p. 10).As a bottom‐up initiative that achieved this scopeof change, I read this strategy as an equity‐driven inno‐vation: All of the outcomes represent operational trans‐formation, where TGD2S communities have been explic‐itly incorporated across City structures. Compared to amodel of ad hoc inclusion, where responsibility for thestrategy lies with a staff champion (Bain & Podmore,2020), by 2019, the strategy had been embedded intothe work of affordable housing, engineering, and manyother units because “departmental goals to achieve[TGD2S] inclusion [had] been identified for implemen‐tation” every year since the strategy’s adoption (City ofVancouver, 2019b, p. 5). Moreover, the successful scopeof the intervention stems in part from the deliberateapproach taken early on: The TGVIWG developed theBuilding a Path report in such a way that its findings andrecommendations were clearly aligned with the direc‐tions of the Park Board’s strategic framework. This madefor a clear business case in conjunctionwith thework thePark Board already sought to undertake.The second element illuminated by this review isthat the City‐wide policy implicationswere accomplishedthrough a volunteer‐driven strategy that relied on theknowledge and expertise of TGD2S people. Starting withthe TGVIWG report, TGD2S inclusion began from a vol‐unteer TGVIWG‐led consultation, which was a shift inprocedural process at the City: In effect, the City sup‐ported the bottom‐up initiative by providing meetingspace and funding but enabled the TGVIWG to take thelead. This power‐sharing move also meant a shift in theworking interpretation of expertise. For the data col‐lection process to be considered valid, the embodiedexpertise of TGVIWG and community members had tobe assigned value. This approach to participatory gov‐ernance is characteristic of an innovatory model that isbased upon pluralized and dispersed authority (McGuirket al., 2022).Moreover, the path leading from the TGVIWG to theTGD2S strategy was, in practice, a process of co‐design.Blomkamp (2018, p. 63, emphasis in original) notes thatco‐design requires that “people who are affected by theissue are active participants in the design process,” fromthe outset rather than simply involved in a consulta‐tion at a mid‐way or endpoint. The relational exchangebetween the TGVIWG, the Park Board, and the City canbe characterized this way, particularly once the organi‐zation elected to act on the expertise shared by com‐munity members. Once at the stage of strategy devel‐opment, the consultants, who had been at the centreof the volunteer working group, also undertook a pro‐cess of stakeholder consultation, but this time lookinginternally. The team met with fifty‐seven participantsacross thirteen City departments plus City‐affiliated orga‐nizations, as well as select advisory committees andexternal service providers who are familiar with theneeds of the most vulnerable TGD2S community mem‐bers. Bringing internal feedback to bear on expertiseshared and lessons gleaned in the Park Board work, theUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 223–234 231consultants extended the co‐design practice into a strat‐egy adopted by the council.These three features in particular—its participatory‐driven co‐design, its wide‐reaching policy‐related impact,and the fact that its outcomes originated through a formof pluralized and dispersed authority—indicate that theTGD2S strategy can be interpreted as an equity‐driveninnovation. Yet, it is important to note that this interpre‐tation does not align perfectly with theorizations of inno‐vatory urban governance. According to McGuirk et al.(2022, p. 1403), “innovatory practices explicitly seek lessstate‐centred enactments of governance.” In the TGD2Scase, the intention was not to extend authority beyondthe confines of local government, even as authoritywas distributed through the practices of co‐production.Indeed, the intention was to make government the locusof the equity work: The process was conceptualizedwithin the context of municipal government, fundedand supported by the municipal government, and thechanges enacted are to government structures, whetherphysical infrastructure or data collection forms. Arguably,retaining a state‐centred enactment of innovatory gov‐ernance is optimal because TGD2S human rights are atstake. For changes that involve bringing equity to theforefront, direction from an agreed‐upon authority likethe municipal government is important.7. Conclusion: Equity as Innovation?The TGD2S strategy levelled up equity and access forTGD2S community members, including City staff andresident/visitor users of programs and services. Severalyears following its approval by the council, it remains avisible component of the City of Vancouver’s equity pro‐file. TGD2S‐specific needs are apparent across variousactions, like efforts to increase specialized homeless shel‐ter capacity (City of Vancouver, 2019a). There is also arecognition that gender diversity is only one layer of aperson’s identity, which is necessarily informed by theirrace, ability, and other identity categories. This is evi‐dent in the way that TGD2S needs are embedded acrossstrategies: For instance, TGD2S people and experienceare informing the safety priority of the Women’s EquityStrategy (City of Vancouver, 2022) and select Indigenousreconciliation efforts (City of Vancouver, 2020). Fundingis being sought from the 2023 operating budget toupdate the 2016 strategy.As this story also suggests, the impacts of the TGD2Sstrategy have been felt well beyond TGD2S communities.One example is the addition of universal washrooms inthe City’s Building By‐Law, which affects City‐owned facil‐ities as well as buildings not owned or operated by theCity (City of Vancouver, 2019b). The 2019 By‐Law updatesrequire gender‐neutral washrooms in all types of occu‐pancies, from residential to industrial (City of Vancouver,2019b, p. A‐1). In 2013, when the By‐Law was modifiedto require gender‐neutral washrooms in public buildings,supporters noted the wider benefits of this change, espe‐cially for users who need assistance or care provision inthe washroom. This was emphasized in the 2014 Buildinga Path report, which indicated that many recreation cen‐tres rely on universal spaces like the accessible single‐stallor family washroom. In turn, the high demand for thesefew spaces “pits the needs of diverse users against oneanother” (Vancouver Boardof Parks andRecreation, 2014,p. 17). With a change in By‐Law and, as recommendedby the TGD2S strategy, the sharing of these best prac‐tices with architects’ and engineers’ associations (Cityof Vancouver, 2019b), greater access to universal wash‐roomswill be availablemore broadly. This is another formof equity as innovation: It is an example of how address‐ing the needs of the most marginalized improves servicesnot just for one population in need, but for everyone.The TGD2S strategy demonstrates that equity inter‐ventions can indeed drive innovation inmunicipal govern‐ment. The need for similar interventions and innovationsis widespread, especially for approaches that centre theexpertise of those who feel less entitled to a seat at theplanning table. The TGD2S strategy provides a useful start‐ing point to offer lessons about the impact that pluralizedauthority and co‐design can have. These processes canmake visible communities that had been previously invis‐ible to the City and ultimately reshape the City’s knowl‐edge and practices. At the same time, they work to makecities safer andmore inclusive for thosewhose voices andneeds have never been factored into municipal planning.AcknowledgmentsMany thanks to the editors and four reviewers who tookthe time to comment on this article.Conflict of InterestsThe author declares no conflict of interests.ReferencesAndrew, C., &Doloreux, D.

    "abstract": "In 2016, the Vancouver City Council passed the Supporting Trans* Equality and an Inclusive Vancouver policy, a motion that prompted the development of a strategy aimed at ensuring the safety and accessibility of municipal programs, services, and physical spaces for Two-Spirit, trans, and gender-diverse (TGD2S) users, including residents, City staff, and visitors. Binary gender is a taken-for-granted assumption of most urban forms and functions: It is encoded in all municipal data collection forms, building codes, signage, and communication strategies. At its root, then, addressing trans inclusion requires the municipal government to attend to and redesign the gendered models of service, programs, and space upon which the city is built. This article tells the story of the Supporting Trans* Equality and an Inclusive Vancouver policy and is driven by two goals. First, I document this policy as a contribution to the urban policy and planning literature, where attention to gender diversity is due. Second, using the trans inclusion strategy, I show how a municipal equity policy aimed at addressing the safety and inclusion of TGD2S people can have significant impacts beyond its immediate scope. To develop this idea, I consider how equity-driven innovation can substantially reshape institutional practices",
