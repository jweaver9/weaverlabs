They received their Bachelor of  Arts in Sociology with minors in Natural Science, Psychology, and Gender Studies from the University of  Southern California. Their experiences as a queer and trans Asian American have informed their engagement with social justice through a multicultural and intersectional lens. Their goal is to be a passionate advocate for queer and trans students and students of  Color, and to educate and engage university communities about queer and trans communities and communities of  Color as a whole.Parts of  a Whole: Reframing Identity Development Theory as a Queer and Trans Person of  ColorEm Chih-Rou HuangIn the field of  higher education and student affairs, identity development theory is an integral part of  understanding how students develop and the ways their experiences are shaped by their understanding of  themselves (Patton, Renn, Guido, & Quaye, 2016; Renn & Reason, 2013; Torres, Jones, & Renn, 2009). This article incorporates Crenshaw’s (1991) theory of  intersectionality to examine the impact of  racism, heterosexism, and cissexism in understanding the identity develop-ment narrative of  the author, a queer and trans Chinese Vietnamese American graduate student. To recognize the impact of  conflicting values among a student’s families and communities, this article focuses on the importance of  incorporating intersectional understandings of  privilege and oppression to inform student-centered theoretical conceptions of  the identity development of  queer and trans students of  Color.In today’s shifting social and political climate, identity salience is becoming increasingly prominent in students’ experiences (Ethier & Deaux, 1994). For student affairs professionals, this shift necessitates an engagement with identity development theory to develop an understanding of  student experiences and inform student support. Although theories that focus on racial, gender, or sexual identity development can provide significant insight into the experiences of  students with these identities, they were not developed with an intersectional lens to address multiple marginalized identities. For queer and trans students of  Color, a siloed identity development approach does not acknowledge the ever-changing connections and tensions between different aspects of  identity. The result is two disparate and seemingly incompatible theoretical narratives: one for queer and trans students and another for students of  Color.• 87Theories serve as compelling tools for examining the systems of  power, privilege, and oppression shaping students’ experiences, and contexts they develop in. I have experienced the ability of  identity development theories to validate marginalized students’ personal identities and experiences. However, theories explore marginalized identities largely in isolation, without consideration for intersectionality. Theories of  sexual or gender identity development are centered around Whiteness, while racial identity development theories assume that students are cisgender and straight. Though these theories work to better understand individual identities, they reduce identity development to a set of  single stories with disparate narratives that are often incongruent. Students who hold multiple marginalized identities must choose pieces of  different theories to build a theoretical representation of  their experiences; such demands by theory fail to honor students’ holistic selves.To support students in their holistic identity development, it is necessary to utilize an intersectional lens to critique and understand identity development as an individual experience affected by all systemic issues of  privilege and oppression (Crenshaw, 1991). To ground my work, I seek first to authentically situate and understand my narrative and epistemology in this approach. This article attempts to connect theory to practice by critiquing stage-based student identity development models using a reflective, intersectional, and critical-constructivist approach. Theoretical GroundingDimensions of  Student Identity DevelopmentEarly iterations of  student identity development theories sought to explain intrapersonal psychosocial identity development for college students. Originally seen as applicable to all students, student identity development theories were later criticized for focusing on homogenous populations of  students with dominant identities, specifically cisgender straight White men (Patton, Renn, Guido, & Quaye, 2016). By assuming that all students follow the same path of  development, these theories neglected to acknowledge how systems of  power and privilege shape the experiences of  students with different social identities. Scholars later began to explore social identities as distinct aspects of  a student’s identity (Torres, Jones, & Renn, 2009). Theories examining specific identities such as race, gender, or sexual orientation became part of  the literature, resulting in explorations of  student identity development seeking to understand how differences in social identity could create differences in experience.Racial identity development. Theories of  racial identity development examine the role that race plays in an individual’s sense of  self  through self-identification, Huang88 • The Vermont Connection • 2017 • Volume 38 identification through the perceptions of  others, and the experiences derived from that identity. Racial identities are experienced as dominant or subordinate, which is reflected in racism and White supremacy (Patton et al., 2016). As situated in the context of  the U.S., Black, Latinx, Asian, Native/Indigenous, and multiracial identities are considered as marginalized racial and ethnic identities, while White identity is considered as dominant.Current racial identity development models are predominantly stage-based. The foundations for many of  these models were developed from the Atkinson, Morten, and Sue (1979, 1989, 1993, 1998) minority identity development model, which was revised by Sue and Sue (2003) as the racial and cultural identity development (RCID) model. The RCID model describes the racial identity development of  people of  Color in five stages. The first stage, conformity, describes an identification with White culture along with a rejection of  one’s cultural heritage, and is often connected with internalized racism. Dissonance, the second stage, describes the conflict experienced when one’s experiences do not fit with their White worldview, which leads to questioning dominant culture and developing an interest in one’s own racial/ethnic group. Third, resistance and immersion consist of  the conscious rejection of  White culture in favor of  exploring an individual’s racial/ethnic identity, which the individual begins to see as their own. Introspection, the fourth stage, describes the individual’s attempts to find balance between White culture and their own racial/ethnic identity and culture, and explores how these shape the individual’s identity. The fifth and final stage, synergistic articulation and awareness, describes the individual’s integration of  knowledge and experience into a holistic understanding of  their racial/ethnic identity, the role that it plays with other aspects of  their identity, and the ways that the individual exists in conjunction with other racial/ethnic groups.Sexual identity development. Theories on sexual identity development focus on the ways that individuals experience and come into an endless combination of  identities pertaining to different aspects of  sexuality, including attraction, desire, and behavior. As social identities, sexual identities are also understood as dominant or subordinate based on the system of  heterosexism and homophobia (Patton et al., 2016). In the context of  the United States, sexual identities that involve same-gender attraction or sexual behavior, such as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, are most often viewed as subordinate identities. However, these identities are only a few of  those that fall under the umbrella term queer, which includes other identities such as pansexual, asexual, demisexual, skoliosexual, polysexual, same gender loving, kink, polyamorous, and others. Because queer identity serves to describe sexual identities that do not conform to the dominant identity of  heterosexual monogamy without strictly defining them, the identities and experiences encompassed by the term queer are as numerous and diverse as the individuals who hold them.• 89Sexual identity development theories have predominantly focused only on the development of  gay, lesbian, or bisexual identities, neglecting to address the existence of  other queer identities. Cass’s (1979) theory of  homosexual identity formation was developed from a study of  gay men and described as a linear psychosocial model through which an individual experiences conflict, internalization, and synthesis of  a homosexual identity. The model involves a linear progression through six stages: 1) identity confusion, involving questioning of  the individual’s self-perception as heterosexual; 2) identity comparison, involving feelings of  social isolation and alienation from former assumptions and heterosexual people; 3) identity tolerance, involving acknowledgment of  a gay or lesbian identity and seeking out other gay and lesbian people; 4) identity acceptance, involving increasing interaction with gay and lesbian culture and selective disclosure of  a gay or lesbian identity; 5) identity pride, involving immersion into gay and lesbian culture and rejection of  heterosexual values, institutions, and communities; and 6) identity synthesis, involving integration of  the individual’s sexual orientation into their identity as a whole. Cass’s model became one of  the most widely disseminated theories regarding sexual identity development, but has been criticized for its rigid linear approach and focus on coming out, identity disclosure, and engagement in the queer community as necessary for the completion of  identity development (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005).In contrast to stage-based models of  queer identity development, D’Augelli (1994) presented a lifespan model for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) identity development that involved six processes that did not have to occur in a particular order. These identity development processes included exiting heterosexuality, developing a personal LGB identity, developing an LGB social identity, becoming an LGB offspring, developing an LGB intimacy status, and entering an LGB community. While D’Augelli’s model addresses some of  the prominent critiques about stage-based models, its scope is still limited, failing to address experiences beyond sexual orientation and sexual orientation identity for LGB identities.Gender identity development. Theories on gender identity development focus on the way an individual experiences and develops an understanding of  their identity, expression, and role as related to gender. An individual’s expression and internalization of  their identity may or may not be congruent with dominant social gender constraints (Patton et al., 2016). Gender as a social identity is understood as dominant and subordinate in relation to two systems of  oppression: sexism and cissexism. Sexism, as encountered through patriarchy, situates women, genderqueer, and nonbinary identities as subordinate, while men’s identities are considered dominant. Cissexism focuses on the oppression experienced by trans, genderqueer, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people whose identities are considered subordinate, while cisgender identities are dominant. While sexism Huang90 • The Vermont Connection • 2017 • Volume 38 and cissexism are two distinct systems, gender identity is connected to and impacted by both. As this article focuses on queer and trans students of  Color, trans identity development theory will be prioritized.In contrast to the earlier theories and models developed to explain queer identity development, trans identity development models have been scarce. Lev’s (2004) stage-based model uses a counseling perspective to understand transgender emergence. Criticisms of  Lev’s model are similar to those of  stage-based queer identity development models, specifically that while a range of  gender identities are acknowledged, the focus is on a narrow definition of  transition, either from male to female (MTF) or female to male (FTM). Furthermore, Lev (2004) discusses sexual orientation only in terms of  heterosexual or homosexual, defined by gender identity and sex changes. This can be attributed at least in part to the influence of  the medical and psychiatric framework of  the counseling perspective. In doing so, the model erases the identity of  trans, genderqueer, and nonbinary people who experience transition and sexual identity beyond these linear and binary ways.IntersectionalityFirst developed by Crenshaw (1991) to explain the marginalization of  Black women at the intersections of  their identities through a legal lens, intersectionality has become a framework to explore the impact of  the interconnected systems of  privilege and oppression. The framework builds from critical scholarship around the intersection of  marginalized identities first explored by Black feminist perspectives (Collins, 2002), seeking to encompass the myriad of  socio-political identities held by an individual and the experiences that are connected with them holistically. Acknowledging the ways intersecting identities shape each other, it examines how individuals are part of  systems of  inequality and how they experience privilege and oppression at the same time (Crenshaw, 1991). While intersectionality is not a student development theory, it provides a framework to analyze the contexts influencing identity development. Its focus on an individual’s existence in relation to power inequities and the resulting experiences allows for a critical examination of  student development theory and its applications to the development of  complex, multidimensional identities (Renn & Reason, 2013).Parts of  a WholeReflecting on my experiences of  identity development and my own understandings of  their significance, I juxtapose prescribed narratives from identity development theories with stories from my narrative that are connected to my holistic identity as a queer, trans, Chinese Vietnamese American student. By examining my lived experiences through this intersectional lens, I hope to depict my process that has • 91allowed me to move beyond narratives of  individual identities to construct an understanding of  my whole self.I Am Chinese Vietnamese AmericanI was Chinese before I was Asianthe language spoken, the food eaten, the holidays celebrated at homeall Chineseand nothing else.Except we ate pho once a weekmy dad born and raised in Vietnambut he always reminded me that he was Chinesewhich meant that we were a Chinese familywhich meant that I wasChinese and Vietnameseno, Chinese not Vietnameseand nothing else.The first year of  elementary schoolI learned the difference between Chinese, Korean, and Japanesedifferent outfits worn to World Cultures Daydifferent ways we said hellowe ate fried rice, kimchi, and sushi to match.All of  this, my teacher said, is Asian food.But each felt so different and not the same at alljust as the names of  Hwang and Hanamotoso different from Huang.The first day of  middle schoolI learned that there are other kinds of  Asiansome with brown skin and names like Castillo and Pascual with lumpia in lunchboxessome with brown skin and names like Bhakta and Shah bringing samosas to schoolAll of  you, the teachers said, are Asian.But we looked at each other and shruggedwe were each so different and not the same at all.But we lived in Americawe recited the Pledge of  Allegiance every dayI asked my dad why I wasChinese Americaninstead ofAmerican Chinesehe said, because that is how people see us.I shrugged and said, okay.Huang92 • The Vermont Connection • 2017 • Volume 38 The first week of  collegeI passed by the Chinese American Student Associationthe table with the red tablecloththe people that looked like meI went to the table with the rainbow flag insteadthe people that felt like meIn the color-filled queer communityeach so different and not the same at allthey understoodwhen my dad said, you know it’s a choice.I couldn’t just shrug and say, okay.The third week of  graduate schoolsomeone told me, you attempt to assimilate into whiteness.Did you know a white man told me to“Go back to Thailand, bitch”I have never been whiteenough to shrug and say, I’m just American.I am too queerto go home to my Asian familyso different and not the same at all.According to Sue and Sue’s (2003) RCID model, as an Asian American student, I would have begun my racial identity development in conformity with an identification with White culture, rejection of  my own culture, and experiencing internalized racism in an attempt to assimilate into whiteness. Instead, I grew up strongly identifying with my ethnicity and nationality as Chinese American, and my racial identification was secondary to this. Rather than experiencing dissonance from a realization that my experiences did not fit the White-centric worldview I held, I found that my queerness and transness prohibited me from fitting the Chinese American worldview created by my family. This stems from the homophobia and transphobia that exist in my family, both of  which are connected to the expectations they had of  me as a Chinese and Christian girl. Because my queer and trans narrative does not align with the prescribed narrative of  a person of  Color, I must claim my racial and ethnic identity as one that is made unique by the intersection of  my Chinese Vietnamese culture, American culture, and queer culture.• 93I Am QueerThe first time I see two women kiss on Grey’s AnatomyI can’t stop thinking about it.wanting.imagining.being?no, not beingI am not blonde.there is always one that is blonde.so I must be the brunetteexcept my last name is not Torres or Fitch or Lopez or Porterit is Huangbut it’s okay I can make believethat my skin looks like thatthat my hair looks like thatthat my eyes look like thatthat…no.that’s not me.The first time my parents see me watching Grey’s Anatomythey can’t stop thinking about it.agonizing.praying.fixing?no, not fixingI am not broken.they were always told I was broken.so I must be finebut they don’t say they love me no matter what or reject me entirelythey wait in silencebut it’s okay I can deal with itI can turn my backthey are dead to methey don’t care about methey are still there…still family.Huang94 • The Vermont Connection • 2017 • Volume 38 According to Cass’s (1979) theory of  homosexual identity formation, sexual identity development is considered to be representative of  identity pride, in which the individual is immersed in gay and lesbian culture and rejects heterosexual values, institutions, and communities before being followed by identity synthesis, in which sexual identity has been integrated into the individual’s holistic identity. However, this does not align with my experiences, in which my identity as a person of  Color shapes the type of  queer culture that I connect to. While the queer community is racially and ethnically diverse, visible queer culture is overwhelmingly White. Racism is rampant in the queer community, with people of  Color often deemed as lesser than their White counterparts or, conversely, fetishized. Cissexism determines the palatability of  queerness, with depictions defaulting either to flamboyant, gay men who are not depicted as sexual, or cis, femme, lesbian women with long hair and long nails who are hypersexualized and objectified.Furthermore, the two most distinct queer narratives in media are portrayed in a dualistic manner. Either an individual receives unending support or is rejected and cut off  by one’s family. D’Augelli’s (1994) notion of  becoming an LGB offspring focuses on this coming out aspect, and does not account for the complicated relationship of  a family who does not accept the individual’s queerness and yet does not cut them off. I do not see myself  in these depictions of  queer people. Without reflections of  my experiences, I struggle to find pride in the culture and values of  a community that does not seem to be built for me, and instead must seek identity synthesis by acknowledging the validity of  my own existence.• 95I Am TransGenderfluid.like Ruby Rose, I can still wear normal girl clothes(translation: like Ruby Rose, I can still look like a girl)Genderqueer.I don’t need hormones(translation: I don’t want to be a boy)Nonbinary.I still don’t need hormones(translation: I don’t want to be a girl either)Dysphoria.I can’t breathe(translation: I need help)Trans.I’m changing(translation: I’m terrified)Dysphoria.I’m afraid(translation: It’s still bad)Nonbinary.At least nobody’s looking at me(translation: It’s easier to get home safe)Genderqueer.I don’t have to talk about hormones(translation: I’m not sure if  I can do this)Genderfluid.My grandmother needs me to be a girl(translation: I’m not a girl any more)Genderqueer, genderfluid, and nonbinary trans.Who am I?(translation: It changes every day)Huang96 • The Vermont Connection • 2017 • Volume 38 According to Lev’s (2004) model of  transgender emergence, trans identity development involves consecutive stages of  exploration. The exploration of  identity and self-labeling comes first, followed by the exploration of  transition issues and possible body modification. The final stage is integration, in which an individual experiences acceptance and deals with post-transition issues. This model relies on identities, labels, transition issues, and body modification as available and accessible in a linear fashion to a trans person to reach acceptance and integration of  a trans identity. However, this assumes that there is only one possible progression through trans identity development and transition.As I have experienced changes in my body from hormone therapy, I have shifted the labels I identify with. As a trans person of  Color, I think about the ways that transitioning and passing are tied to safety. Knowing that trans people of  Color, specifically Black trans women, experience more violence than White trans people, thoughts about safety shape the way that I may attempt to pass as opposed to asking for my identity to be recognized. As an Asian transmasculine person, however, I also experience less violence than many transfeminine people due to the ways that androgyny and femininity are already ascribed to Asian people. This assigned androgyny allows me to adapt my gender expression with less fear. Finally, my relationships with my family play a substantial role in shaping the way I identify or approach physical expression of  my transness because of  their expectations around gender and how I present myself. These expectations are situated in transphobia, and influence the way I express my gender around my family. Lev’s approach does not account for these constantly shifting contexts of  environment, which are necessary to understand not only how the individual wants to experience their gender but also how others want them to experience and portray their gender.Implications for PracticeStudent affairs professionals must move away from rigid applications and interpretations of  identity development theories. While theories can provide important points of  reference for experiences or processes of  identity development, utilizing them in isolation oversimplifies the complexity of  identity development, especially for students with multiple marginalized identities. Though the experiences connected to identity development examined in this article are limited, centering the use of  an intersectional lens shows that relying solely on identity development theories focused on one aspect of  identity is not enough.To best understand the experiences of  queer and trans students of  Color, there must be space for nuanced discussions of  the myriad systems of  privilege and oppression that interplay to shape each aspect of  the student’s identity. However, • 97making assumptions based only on one’s knowledge of  systems of  privilege and oppression disregards a student’s experiences that may resonate in some ways with an identity development model, connect to an intersectional understanding of  how a theory applies, or not connect at all. Although this article focuses on the intersections of  racial, sexual, and gender identity for queer and trans students of  Color, other identities may hold more salience for the student. Student affairs practitioners should continue to familiarize themselves with the contexts of  other identities and how they may be experienced.Most importantly, identity development theory cannot be the sole source used to understand students. Rather, a student’s own narrative and experiences must be the driving factor. Utilizing a critical understanding of  a student’s context to provide guidance to co-construct an understanding of  their narrative and experiences creates a student-centered process that validates and appreciates each unique story.Huang98 • The Vermont Connection • 2017 • Volume 38 ReferencesAtkinson, D.
