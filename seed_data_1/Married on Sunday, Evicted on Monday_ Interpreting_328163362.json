MARRIED ON SUNDAY, EVICTED ON MONDAY: INTERPRETING THE FAIR HOUSING ACT'S PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION \"BECAUSE OF SEX\" TO INCLUDE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY JOSEPH J. RAILEY* INTRODUCTION An openly gay male and his partner decide to rent an apart-ment together. After finding a unit they like, the couple contacts the landlord; the landlord declines to rent to the couple because of their \"alternative lifestyle.\" At the same time, a transgender female and her wife are looking for a home together; they are unable to find a realtor willing to work with them. Presently there are no nationwide protections against hous-ing discrimination based on an individual's sexual orientation1 or gender identity. 2 Further, twenty-eight states do not include sexual orientation and gender identity in their state housing discrimination laws. Thus, depending on the state where these couples live, the landlords and realtors' actions described above could be legal.

Sexual orientation may be heterosexual, same sex.., or bisexual.\" and \"Gender Identity\" is defined as one's self identification as male or female). 2 See discussion inJfa Part II(A). ' See discussion inJfa Part II(A)(2). 100 Buffalo Public Interest Law Journal Vols. 36-37 stands today, in over half the country, it is possible for a gay couple to be married on Sunday only to be evicted from their home on Monday simply for being with the person they love. When the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in 2015, in the landmark case Obergefellv. Hodges,4 the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ or gay) legal commu-nity was faced with a simple question: \"now what?\" Having secured marriage equality, advocates settled on comprehensive protections for the LGBTQ community as the next fight.5 To that end, less than a month after the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell,both Houses of Congress had introduced legislation (The Equality Act)6 to provide Federal protections against discrimination to gay individuals in many areas, including housing. However, the Equality Act died at the end of the 114th Congress, and Federal protections for LGBTQ individuals in housing have not been incorporated into Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (The Fair Housing Act).8 This Article shows the importance and need for protection for gay individuals against housing discrimination. Further, this Article argues the Federal courts can-and should-interpret the existing language in the Fair Housing Act to provide protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity under the Act's prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex. Part I lays out a brief history of LGBTQ rights and discrimination as they relate to housing. Part II examines the current federal and state housing dis-crimination laws, argues that statutory interpretation is sufficient to provide protections, and addresses the level of scrutiny that the Court has traditionally applied in constitutional analysis to sexual orientation and gender identity. Part III analyzes why the judiciary is presently better suited to provide protections against housing Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. _, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015).5 See Timothy M.

Part IV shows the connection between \"sex,\" \"sexual orientation,\" and \"gender identity\" by examining scholarly writing and recent legal decisions. Finally, Part V calls on the Court to interpret \"discrimination because of sex\" to include sexual orientation and gender identity and concurrently to apply intermediate scrutiny to LGBTQ constitutional equal protec-tion claims in the future. I. HISTORY OF LGBTQ RIGHTS & HOUSING DISCRIMINATION Since the advent of the modem LGBTQ rights movement with the Stonewall Riot in June 1969, the rights gay Americans enjoy have increased dramatically. 9 Today, LGBTQ individuals nationwide are no longer considered to be criminals because of their identity1° or to have a mental disease.11 Additionally, LGBTQ indi-12 viduals enjoy the right to marry, and can serve in the military,13 among other advancements. Further, the public has become more accepting of LGBTQ individuals 14 with a number now even holding 9 The Stonewall Riot, HISTORY.COM, http://www.histoiy.com/this-day-in-history/the-stonewall-riot (last visited Jan. 14, 2017); see generally DAVID CARTER, STONEWALL: THE RIOTS THAT SPARKED THE GAY REVOLUTION (2004). The Riot began on July 28 following a police raid at he Stonewall Inn in Man-hattan and marks the beginning of the modem LGBTQ rights movement. Id. The riot was among the most visible early incidents of LGBTQ people defending themselves and is commemorated annually across the world with Pride events in June. Id. 10Lawrence v.

A recent study from the Williams Institute noted that in states with state level protections for LGBTQ peoples there were on aver-age three reports of discrimination per 100,000 people. As points of comparison, the same study found an average of 5 complaints per 100,000 people of color, and 1complaint per 100,000 people for women. Id. 2017-2019 Married on Sunday individuals reported fearing some form of housing discrimination. 18 Additionally, many respondents cited a state with protections against housing discrimination as a high priority in choosing a place to live. 19 In another study, emails were sent to housing providers from \"straight\" and \"gay\" couples.20 Predictably, in that study, the LGBTQ couples received considerably fewer responses than straight counterparts. 21 Finally, among young and old LGBTQ individuals, access to housing is a significant issue. One study reports that 48% of gay seniors faced discrimina-tion of some form when applying for senior housing.22 At the other end of the age spectrum, LGBTQ youth suffer from lack of access to housing with nearly 40% of homeless youth in the country identify-ing as LGBTQ. 23 Acknowledging this history of discrimination, Congress noted in the Equality Act, \"LGBT[Q] people often face discrimination when seeking to rent or purchase housing .. .\" and \"[n]ational surveys ... show that housing discrimination against LGBT[Q] people is very prevalent., 24 Despite the well-documented history of discrimination, the current federal law provides no protec-tions for LGBTQ individuals with regard to housing.

Federal Laws The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against an individual on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin\" when selling or renting a home. 1 The law also makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms and conditions of the sale, advertise or represent property as being for sale to certain groups, and to discriminate based on a handicap in any way. 2 Notably, the Fair Housing Act's definitions section does not provide a definition for what is protected as \"sex.\" 33 The absence of a stated definition in the Act leaves courts open to interpret what the term \"sex\" precisely means, and therefore what \"discrimination based on sex\" means.34 Under the Obama administration, HUD has interpreted the Fair Housing Act favorably toward gay individuals. On the Depart-ment's website for LGBTQ individuals, they note that discrimina-tion against LGBTQ people could be classified as discrimination based on sex.3 5 Accordingly, HUD's policies allowed for an indivi-dual to sue for sex discrimination based on the individual's noncon-formity to gender stereotypes (i.e. dating a person of the same gender, wearing clothing commonly attributed to another gender, or being transgender)3 6 Additionally, during the Obama administra-tion, HUD prevented discrimination against an individual because they have HIV or AIDS (this would be discrimination based on a handicap) and explicitly prevented discrimination based on actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity by providers funded or with loans from the Federal Housing Administration.3 7 by HUD While President Obama and Secretary Castro had interpreted HUD policies favorably toward LGBTQ individuals, it remains to be seen how the department will operate under President Trump and 31 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) (2012). 32_d. at §§ (b)-(f) (2012). 33See id. § 3602 (2012).34See discussion infra Part IV. 35 See EndingHousingDiscrimination,supranote 28.36 d. 37id. 106 Buffalo Public Interest Law Journal Vols. 36-37 his nominee, Dr. Ben Carson.3 8 During his confirmation hearing in January 2017, Dr. Carson noted he did not believe that LGBTQ individuals should get \"extra rights. 39 It appears, therefore, likely that under the current administration, -JUD will be less protective toward LGBTQ individuals and their rights.4 ° 2. State Laws In general, the fifty states and the District of Columbia can be divided into three categories in relation to their housing discrimination laws: states that have protections against discrimina-tion for individuals based on sexual orientation and gender identity, those with protections based on sexual orientation only, and finally, those with no protections. According to current projections, approxi-mately 48% of the LGBTQ population lives in states with protec-tions based on sexual orientation and gender identity.41 While this is significant, the majority of gay individuals are still subject to harm-ful housing practices simply because of who they are.42 Moreover, many gay people choose to move to states with housing protections in order to have a sense of security.43 In doing so, many LGBTQ individuals may be in a sense forced to either move away from friends and family or live in states with inadequate housing protec-tions. 3' HUD History, HUD, https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/about/hud_ history (last visited Mar. 5, 2017) (Julidn Castro served as the sixteenth HUD Secretary from July 28, 2014 until January 20, 2017).39 See Tim Devaney, Carson: No 'ExtraRights' for Gay Americans, THE HILL (Jan. 12, 2017, 11:31 AM), http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/313968-carson-no-extra-rights-for-gay-americans. 40 As of this note's writing in late May 2017, Secretary Carson has not rolled back HUD's public housing protections for LGBTQ individuals. 41 Non-DiscriminationLaws, LGBT MOVEMENT ADVANCEMENT PROJECT, http:// www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non discrimination laws (last visited Jan. 19, 2017).42id. 43 See generallyNAGLREP, supranote 16. 2017-2019 Married on Sunday Twenty states and the District of Columbia provide protec-tions based on both sexual orientation and gender identity.44 Another two states protect only against discrimination based on sexual orientation. 45 The remaining twenty-eight states provide no protec-tions for discrimination against LGBTQ people.46 As a result of the incongruent nature of state laws, the only viable way for LGBTQ individuals to have adequate protection against harmful discrimina-\" See CAL.

Among the twenty-one states (including the District of Columbia) that protect against discrimination on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity, there is a broad degree of variance in how exactly the laws achieve this result. Most states have amended their respective state Fair Housing Acts to provide sexual orientation and gender identity protections. One state (Con-necticut) protects discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation with its own title,48 while others also provide protection against housing discrimination on the basis of HIV status.4 9 Another state (Rhode Island) amended its laws by creating new statutes that universally insert \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" after the word \"sex\" in the housing title.50 While really two separate things, some states also include gender identity or expression in the definition of sexual orientation thereby providing protection for the full range of the LGBTQ community.51 While the protections are significant, the absence of federal protections under the Fair Housing Act's prohibition on discrimina-tion \"because of sex\" still leaves LGBTQ Americans in over half the country subject to the potential harm of discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.52 17 See, e.g., CAL.

Level of Scrutiny for Constitutional Equal Protection Analysis Under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments' Equal Protection Clause, the Court has developed levels of scrutiny in order to protect suspect and quasi-suspect groups.53 When subjected to that analysis, sexual orientation and gender identity are reviewed under the default, rational basis review, rather than intermediate or strict scrutiny.54 This level of analysis is used as the Court has not determined which level of analysis properly applies, leading to review under the default standard.55 The Court last remotely approached this question in 1996 in Romer v. Evans.56 In that case, the trial court applied rational basis review and that decision was not appealed.57 However, since that time, lower courts have applied higher levels of review.58 While the Courts have failed to apply heightened scrutiny,59 in a sense constitutional equal protection analysis for the gay community has improved since the infancy of the LGBTQ rights movement.

As such, the judiciary should now hold that laws targeting sexual orientation and gender identity are subject to the same analysis as laws targeting sex and apply intermediate scrutiny in constitutional analysis to protect the LGBTQ community against discrimination.61 C. Statuary Interpretation Versus Constitutional Analysis to Provide for LGBTQ Housing Protections While much of the legal protections for LGBTQ individuals that have been created via the courts have been through constitu-tional analysis, statutory interpretation is the best approach for housing discrimination.62 As noted above, protections in the housing context that already exist at the state level and through HUD for LGBTQ people are statutory rather than constitutional.63 Admit-tedly, constitutional arguments for equal protection for LGBTQ individuals have been effective.64 However, with the current ambi-guity as to what level of scrutiny applies to LGBTQ individuals, statutory interpretation presents the more conservative option.65 After all, it is far easier for the judiciary to interpret \"because of sex\" in federal statutes like the Fair Housing Act to include discrimi-nation based on sexual orientation and gender identity than to reach 60 See generally Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 636 (1996) (holding Colorado's constitutional amendment preventing anti-discrimination rdinances protecting the LGBTQ community to be unconstitutional).61 See discussion infra, Part V. 62 See discussion infra, Part III(B). 63 See discussion supra,Part II(A)(1). 64 See, e.g., Obergefell, 135 S.

Further, these statutory based arguments are already being raised.66 Unless these arguments prove unconvincing to the judiciary, there is no reason to attempt to mount an attack under the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, and perhaps most compelling, an act of Congress or statu-tory interpretation by the courts would provide protections against actions taken by private parties in addition to acts of the state or federal government. It is well settled that the Constitution does not govern the actions of private actors; statutes, however, do.67 This simple principle means that statutory protections, even via judicial interpretation, are the best avenue to universally protect LGBTQ people. III. WHAT BRANCH IS BEST SUITED TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS Compelling arguments can be made for either the legislature or the judiciary to be the agent of expanding civil rights. In the past, LGBTQ rights advocates have been divided over this issue. Some favored action via the judiciary while others, including sometimes even the courts themselves, have argued that the political process is the ideal avenue. 68 By amending the Fair Housing Act, Congress can provide protections to LGBTQ individuals uniformly across the country. Significantly, Congressional action would not require gay rights advocates to argue that discrimination based on sexual orien-tation and gender identity are themselves discrimination because of sex.69 The ability to provide protections, however, is not limited to 66 See discussion infra Part IV. 67 See, e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 264-65 (1964). 68 See DeBoer v. Snyder, 772 F.3d 388 (6th Cir. 2014), rev 'dsub nom Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015); Janet E.

Buffalo Public Interest Law Journal Vols. 36-37 the political branches. The nation's courts can prevent discrimina-tion on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity through statutory interpretation. This can be accomplished by expanding the definition of sex in the Fair Housing Act to include sexual orienta-tion and gender identity. 70 Courts have begun to do just that71 and with the current polarized nature of Congress, continuing to litigate the expansion of the Fair Housing Act's definition of sex is the best strategy for nationwide protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in housing. A. Congress Under our Constitution, Congress makes law.72 The judici-ary subsequently is tasked with reviewing the law and determining the meaning of the words in the statute; they should not make the law themselves.73 Accordingly, laws protecting the rights of minori-ties should be passed in Congress via the democratic process. This, however, does not always happen. For this reason, the system was designed to prevent a \"tyranny of the majority. Moreover, there are some instances where Congress is either unable or unwilling to act. In those instances, the Judiciary should intercede. LGBTQ protections in housing are one such area where Congress has proven itself unwilling to act. Congress has had the chance to protect LGBTQ individuals seeking access to housing. In 2015, the Equality Act was introduced before dying in committee.75 Even prior to, and during, the judicial 70 See discussion infra Part IV. 71 id 72 See U.S. Const. art. I. 73See U.S. Const. art.

See O'Hara, infra note 82; see also H.R. 2282, 115th Cong. (2017). Additionally, Congress has introduced the Fair and Equal Housing Act of 2017, which would provide statutory protections against discrimination on the 2017-2019 Married on Sunday campaign for marriage equality there was a consistent push from the LGBTQ community for legislative protections against discrimina-tion on the basis of an individual's sexual orientation.'76 Outside of housing, Congress' recent record in LGBTQ rights is not much better. In 2009, Congress passed the Matthew Shepard & James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act,77 which expanded the Federal Hate Crimes Law to cover sexual orientation and gender identity. That Act, however, had to be slipped in as a rider to a defense-spending bill in order to make it through Congress.78 Further, the legislative record is filled with examples of congressional animus toward gay individuals. 7 9 Given Congress's inaction with LGBTQ rights in the past, it is unlikely that any substantial changes will presently come via the legislature. Another reason why Congress is unwilling to act in this area is the makeup of the chambers. Congress itself is a political organi-zation with members who are popularly elected. Representatives and Senators from the twenty-eight states without state-level housing protections8 ° would likely not feel compelled to provide protections that their counterparts in state capitals (who were elected by the same electorate) have not themselves provided. This is exacerbated by the fact that LGBTQ rights are still largely seen as a political issue. 81 Because of the makeup of the chambers and the divisive basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

The Courts Justice Scalia once opined, \"statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable vils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed. 86 While battles for LGBTQ equality have played out in both the Capital Building and the courthouse, it has been in the courthouse where the gay community has found much of its success. This history of judi-cial victories coupled with the court's ability to provide protections via statutory interpretation 87 makes the court the ideal venue to expand the Fair Housing Act to protect LGBTQ individuals. Four of the cases from the Court's lengthy history in advancing LGBTQ are particularly relevant to current arguments to expand the definition of sex in the Fair Housing Act. The Court's decision in Romer v. Evans,88 Lawrence v. Texas,89 U.S. v. Wind-sor,90 and Obergefell v. Hodges91 helped to lay the legal framework for current arguments in favor of protections against housing discri-mination. In 1992 voters in Colorado passed a Constitutional amend-ment in response to comprehensive civil rights ordinances in Boulder, Denver, and Aspen.92 The ordinances provided protections against discrimination on a variety of basis, including sexual orien-tation in housing, public accommodation, welfare, and employ-ment.93 The amendment overturned the protections based on sexual orientation and preventing any state or municipal ordinance pro-tecting LGBTQ people. 94 Finding the Colorado law to be little more 86 Oncale v.

Less than a decade after Romer, the Court again handed down a significant LGBTQ decision in Lawrence v. Texas.97 In Lawrence, the Court struck down a Texas law criminalizing same-sex sexual activity. 98 The Court framed the issue around privacy and the right to associate with people of one's choosing. 99 By recog-nizing the right of LGBTQ people to associate freely, 100 the Court effectively decriminalized being gay and allowed gay Americans access to newfound equality. 10 1 Most significantly, the decision in Lawrence set the groundwork for modern fights in LGBTQ rights, including anti-discrimination laws.102 A decade after striking down sodomy laws, in UnitedStates v. Windsor the Court started to address same-sex marriage by striking down the Federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)'s 95 Id. at 634-35 (quoting Dep't of Agric. v.

Two years to the day after the decision in Windsor, marriage equality was lawful nationwide with the Court's decision in Oberge-fe/ v. Hodges.10 5 In Obergefellthe Court held states must recognize marriages performed in other states and that the Constitution provides a right to marry.106 Having found LGBTQ individuals to no longer be effec-tively criminals and provided for their right to marry, the next logical fight is for protection against discrimination in one of life's basic necessities: finding and maintaining a home. These cases provide one piece of the framework by which the judiciary can protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination in housing. The other two pieces, the connection between \"sexual orientation,\"\"gender identity,\" and \"sex\" as concepts and Title VII sex discrimi-nation precedents allow the court to rely on statutory interpretation to expand the meaning of the word \"sex\" in Title VII, and even-tually the Fair Housing Act. IV. \"SEXUAL ORIENTATION\" & \"GENDER IDENTITY\" ARE INTRICATELY LINKED TO \"SEX\" In order for sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination to be protected under the umbrella of sex discrimination, it must be shown that sexual orientation and gender identity are linked to the concept of \"sex.\" Further, as the Fair Housing Act does not include a definition for \"sex\" the concept could be expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity.10 7 The term \"sex\" generally is interpreted to mean purely the \"biological and physiological 103 United States v.

Thus, it is difficult to create a situation where an individual was discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity and either the person's sex or a common gender stereotype is not also implicated. The argument that sexual orientation and gender identity are intrinsically linked to sex has started to resonate with courts. Not surprisingly, with very few exceptions, the argument has largely been raised in the employment context under Title VII. 118 Courts routinely look to Title VII for guidance in deciding cases under the Fair Housing Act. 119 As such, the Title VII cases are instructive to this argument and could pave the way for the Fair Housing Act to 115 Boso, supranote 111, at 589. 116 See Christiansen v.

As noted previously, this type of discrimination is actionable as sex discrimination. 117 The stereotype used in the hypothetical has been recognized as an actionable gender-based stereotype by the court.

The starting point within Title VII case law for expanding the meaning of sex discrimination to include sexual orientation and gender identity is the Supreme Court's decisions in Price Water-house v. Hopkins120 and Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs. Inc.121 These two cases each expanded the scope of actionable sex discrimination under Title VII. Price Waterhouse held that gender-based stereotyping could be actionable under Title VII. 122 Oncale held that harassment by someone of the same or opposite sex of the victim was also actionable under Title VII. 123 Both these cases, along with the LGBTQ rights cases briefly discussed in Part III,124 provide the foundational precedent for the recent cases holding sexual orientation and gender identity to be included as discrimina-tion on the basis of sex. In 2015, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) held that \"[s]exual orientation discrimination is discrimina-tion ... ,, 125 The EEOC notes that \"[s]exual orientation as a concept cannot be defined or understood without references to sex. ... It follows then, that sexual orientation is inseparablefrom and inescapably linked to sex and, therefore that allegations of sexual orientationdiscriminationinvolve sex-basedconsiderations.\"12 6 Recently, the argument that discriminating against some-one's sexual orientation is actionable sex discrimination has been accepted by the Seventh Circuit in Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College.127 In that case, attorneys successfully argued that the plaintiffs denial of a promotion six times because of her sexual 120 490 U.S. 228 (1989). 121 523 U.S. 75 (1998). 122Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 258. 123Oncale, 523 U.S. at 82. 124 See supraPart 111(B). 125 Baldwinv.

The court noted, \"[w]e must decide.., what it means to discriminate on the basis of sex, and in particular whether actions taken on the basis ofsexual orientationare a subset ofactionstaken on the basis of sex.\"129 Hively argued that either under a compara-tive method (where the court should determine if the plaintiff would be treated the same if all things were equal but her sex) or under Loving v. Virginia's13 ° right to intimate association the court could conclude sex based discrimination existed. 131 The Seventh Circuit accepted both of arguments stating that \"[i]t would require consider-able calisthenics to remove the \"sex\" from \"sexual orientation\" and that such an attempt would not be reconcilable with the plain language of Title VII. 132 The Seventh Circuit is not the only court to grapple with this novel argument. Panels of the Eleventh and Second Circuits also recently heard cases alleging sexual orientation discrimination under Title VII's prohibition on sex discrimination. 133 Each panel noted the presence of controlling precedent preventing them from finding in favor of the plaintiffs. 134 In a concurring opinion, however, two judges in the Second Circuit urged the remainder of the court to sit en banc in order to consider whether sexual orientation and gender identity are protected as discrimination on the basis of sex.135 In his 128 See Braden Campbell, Full 7th Cir.

Buffalo Public Interest Law Journal Vols. 36-37 concurrence, Chief Judge Katzmann articulated similar points as the court in Hively, however, he also emphasized how the law has changed in the decades since the controlling cases were decided 136 as well as recent district court cases dealing with sexual orientation and gender-based stereotypes. 137 Recognizing the significance of the issue, Chief Judge Katzmann concluded by remarking that this question \"well may be ... ultimately address[ed]\" by the Supreme138 Court. Hively, Christansen,and similar cases are significant for a number of reasons. These cases show that the courts are beginning to recognize that the \"line between sex discrimination and sexual orientation discrimination.., does not exist, save as a lingering and ' 139 faulty judicial construct.\" These cases also show the federal courts' recognition that sexual orientation and gender identity discri-mination can be solved by the judiciary via statutory interpretation. Finally, as these cases are in employment discrimination and the courts often look to employment cases to resolve novel questions in housing discrimination, these decisions could directly combat the effects of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in housing. This argument has also been raised with limited success in housing. In Smith v. Avanti, a federal case decided in 2017, the plaintiffs, a cisgender and a transgender lesbian couple, alleged that they were denied housing because ofsex.140 The couple alleged that while the defendant was originally willing to rent a property to the plaintiffs, she was no longer willing after meeting them because of 136 In the Second Circuit the relevant controlling cases when Christiansen was decided, Simonton v. Runyon, 232 F.3d 33 (2d Cir. 2000) and Dawson v. Bumble & Bumble, 398 F.3d 211 (2d Cir. 2005) were decided nearly twenty-years ago. Christiansen,852 F.3d at 202 (Katzmann, C.J., concurring). 137 Christensen, 852 F.3d at 205 (Katzmann, C.J., concurring) (citing Boutillier v. Hartford Pub. Sch., 221 F. Supp. 3d 255, 269 (D.

Colo. 2017). 2017-2019 Married on Sunday their \"uniqueness.\" ' 141 The complaint asserted that the Fair Housing Act's prohibition on discrimination based on sex includes \"sex stereo Christensen, 852 F.3d at 205 types, . . . the sex of the spouse, ... sexual orientation, ... and ... gender identity and expres-' 142 sion.\" \"[D]iscrimination 'on the basis of sex' encompasses both the biological differences between men and women, and gender discrimination,that is discriminationbased on a failure to conform to stereotypicalgender norms.\" 143 The District Court accepted the plaintiffs arguments as to gender-based stereotypes and held the Smiths had an actionable claim under the Fair Housing Act.144 However, the court only accepted the Smiths' claims related to gender stereotypes and explicitly declined to hold sexual orientation discrimination itself was actionable. 145 As the case law demonstrates, in most of the country, an LGBTQ plaintiff alleging discrimination is protected only from discrimination on the basis of gender-based stereotypes. While this may capture some of the discrimination, it likely does not capture all discriminatory actions against LGBTQ people. Building on Price Waterhouse, Oncale,and landmark LGBTQ rights cases like Romer, Lawrence, Windsor, and Obergefell,the federal courts are starting to realize that the current paradigm is unworkable. Accordingly, the courts are beginning to hold there is no bright line between \"sex\" and \"sexual orientation\" and accordingly there should not be such a line in the law. While the changes presently are happening primarily in employment cases, given the courts often look to Title VII cases for assistance in determining novel issues in housing,146 this pro-gressive expansion of the meaning of sex to include sexual orienta-tion and gender identity will protect LGBTQ individuals from the 141 Id. at2, 3.142 Id.at 11, 12. 143 P1.'s Mot.

Buffalo Public Interest Law Journal Vols. 36-37 problems associated with being married on Sunday and evicted on Monday. V. WHAT SHOULD THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE? As noted, housing discrimination amongst the LGBTQ community is a significant problem.147 To prevent this issue, the federal government, via the judiciary, should provide housing pro-tections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The Court can accomplish this relatively easily. First, the Court should recog-nize the conflict in the circuits relating to the meaning of the word \"sex\" in Title VII by granting certiorari at the first opportunity and holding \"sex\" to include sexual orientation and gender identity in Title VII and analogous statutes. 148 At the same time, the Court should determine that LGBTQ individuals are a quasi-suspect class that is subject to intermediate scrutiny in order to provide lasting protections for the LGBTQ community. A. \"Because of Sex\" Should Be Interpreted to Prevent Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity The Seventh Circuit's opinion in Hively was a great first step toward judicially achieved protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in housing. As the Seventh is presently one of two circuits to hold that the word \"sex\" includes sexual orientation and gender identity in Title VII 149 this is 147 See discussion supraPart I; see also Lambdalegal, Lambda Legal on the Case: =Smith v. Avanti, YouTUBE (June 17, 2016) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v Le7aMuDjmDQ. \"Housing discrimination is a pervasive problem for LGBT people and is very much underreported.\" Id. 148 Title VII prevents discrimination on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (2012). The Fair Housing Act prevents discrimination on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b). Apart from the addition of familial status in the Fair Housing Act, the two statutes are identical. 149 See Hively v. Ivy Tech Cmty. College, 843 F.3d 339, 341-42 (7th Cir. 2017) (discussing how nine of the remaining circuits have held sex to not include sexual 2017-2019 Married on Sunday an issue that the Supreme Court will likely resolve. 150 As such, when faced with an opportunity, the Court should agree to hear a case implicating the meaning of sex in Title VII. When they hear such a case, the Court should follow the Second and Seventh Cir-cuits' analysis and hold that \"discrimination on the basis of sex\" includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. As federal courts often look to Title VII case law to resolve novel issues under the Fair Housing Act, 151 an expansion of the meaning of sex could be incorporated to the Fair Housing Act relatively easily and without further action by the Supreme Court. Under this route, no intervention from Congress would be needed; the courts would simply interpret the current language of Title VII and then later do the same thing with the nearly identical language of the Fair Housing Act. In addition to this strategy being the most viable, the argument is sensible. As courts have noted, the only place where a line between sexual orientation and sex exists is \"as a lingering and faulty judicial construct.\"' 152 Discrimination on the basis of sex already prevents discrimination because of gender-based stereo-types. Yet because of that \"lingering and faulty judicial construct\" the \"ultimate gender non-conformity,\" and \"prototypical sex-stereotyping animus\" is itself not protected under federal anti-orientation and gender identity). Since Hively, the Second Circuit has held that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is actionable sex discrimination. See Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc., 883 F.3d 100, 108 (2d Cir. 2018). 150 If the Supreme Court resolves this issue, it will not be through Hively as Ivy Tech has not applied for certiorari to the Court.

It is time for judges to realize that a legal system that allows an LGBTQ individual to be married on Sunday and evicted on Monday is fundamentally unjust and to interpret existing law to rectify this injustice. B. The LGBTQ Community Should Be Deter-mined to Be Protected in Constitutional Analysis by Intermediate Scrutiny When the Court takes a case addressing the meaning of discrimination because of sex, the Court should also use that case to guarantee protections for LGBTQ people by holding sexual orienta-tion and gender identity to be constitutionally protected via interme-diate scrutiny. Numerous lower courts have reached this conclusion and determined LGBTQ people should be protected by heightened scrutiny rather than a rational basis test in constitutional analysis. 154 However, while the Supreme Court has mentioned levels of scrutiny in the LGBTQ context, they have never explicitly held that gay people are subject to heightened scrutiny. 155 For example, in the Court's most recent case, they again were silent as to the appropriate level of scrutiny for the LGBTQ community. 156 The Supreme Court should declare LGBTQ people to be a quasi-suspect class subject to intermediate scrutiny. In marriage cases in both California and Hawaii, the courts' conclusions of law determined that LGBTQ people should be protected by heightened scrutiny. 157 As intermediate scrutiny is the standard that applies to 153 See Boutillier v. Hartford Pub. Sch., 221 F. Supp. 3d 255, 269 (D. Conn. 2016) (\"homosexuality is the ultimate gender non-conformity, the prototypical sex stere-otyping animus\").154See cases cited supranote 58 and related text. 155 See, e.g., Romer v. Evan, 517 U.S. 620, 634-635 (1996) (noting that the Colo-rado state statute failed to meet even rational basis); see also Bornstein, supranote 83, at 71. 156 Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2597 (2015). 157 See Peny v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921, 997 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (\"Although Proposition 8 fails to possess even a rational basis, the evidence presented at trial shows that gays and lesbians are the type of minority strict 2017-2019 Married on Sunday discrimination based on \"sex,\"' 158 the same standard applies to sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination, as \"sex\" includes sexual orientation and gender identity. 159 In fact, if the Court were to hold that discrimination on the basis of sexual orienta-tion and gender identity were included in the law's prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex, it would take considerable maneuvering to also hold that the two concepts were not also the same under constitutional analysis. Such a decision would effec-tively remove the line between sex and sexual orientation for the purposes of statutes while maintaining the \"lingering and faulty judicial construct\" in constitutional analysis. While it is possible for statutes to grant more rights and protections than what is guaranteed under the Constitution, it does not make sense to construe the same concept differently in different locations. With that said, some have argued for LGBTQ individuals to be subject o strict rather than intermediate scrutiny. There is a bona fide history of discrimination and prejudice against the gay commu-nity that continues today. 160 Sexual orientation and gender identity are immutable as both traits set at an early age and are highly resistant to change. 161 Courts and scholars have also determined that LGBTQ people are a discrete and insular minority with limited protection in the political process. 162 Acting on this body of research and precedent, the Court properly could determine gay individuals to be a suspect class. While the argument has merit, because of the compelling arguments to interpret \"discrimination because of sex\" to include sexual orientation and gender identity, it would be improper to hold discrimination based on gender (sex) to a lower standard than discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identification. Such an interpretation and constitutional holding scrutinywas designed to protect\") (emphasis added); see also Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44, 68 (Haw. 1993).158 See United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 570 (1996); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 198-99 (1976). 159 See supraPart III. 160 See supraPart I. 161 See generallyPerry,704 F. Supp. 2d 921, at 966. 162 See generallyid.at 997. Buffalo Public Interest Law Journal Vols. 36-37 would render all facets of sex discrimination to be hopelessly unworkable. Holding the gay community to be protected constitu-tionally under intermediate scrutiny will protect LGBTQ people both in housing and countless other legal areas. CONCLUSION Over the past sixty years, the LGBTQ community has come a considerable distance. Gay individuals today have a wealth of rights that those who marched at Stonewall could only dream of Much of this was through the work of the courts. Two of the largest victories in LGBTQ rights, striking down laws criminalizing same sex sexual activity and affirming the right to marry, happened via the judiciary. Today, despite the rights that LGBTQ people have fought for, there still is no federal antidiscrimination statute for housing. The Fair Housing Act protects against discrimination only on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, family status, or national origin.\" 163 On the state level, twenty-eight states have no protections for LGBTQ people in the areas of housing. In the absence of congressional action, it is time for the judiciary to address that. It is time for the courts to interpret \"discrimination because of sex\" in the Fair Housing Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity and it is time for the courts to declare that LGBTQ people are similarly protected by intermediate scrutiny. The judiciary has the precedent and authority to act in the absence of congressional action. Courts must once again protect America's LGBTQ citizens from the harmful effects of discrimination and from being married on Sunday and evicted from their homes on Monday. 163 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) (2012).
