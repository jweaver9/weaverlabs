Some of us need or want to change our names to reflect our gender identi-ties. Depending on one’s beliefs and cultural background, it is possible to accept a new name on marriage or revert to a ‘maiden name’ on divorce. People consider carefully—some might say agonize—over the question whether to change a name and the ramifications of such a change on one’s identity.5 Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, asexual, intersex, queer, ques-tioning, and others (LGBTAIQQO) have often been, and sometimes still are, subjected to derogatory name-calling. Name-calling can be a                                                      * Associate Director for Public Services at Georgia State University College of Law Library. 1 The author would like to thank the several librarians who provided thoughtful advice, suggestions, and commentary regarding this glossary.

Reclamation as a form of resistance may work most readily for those who have other social capital, such as white gay and lesbian communities reclaiming “queer.”8 Determining which groups are included and the order of the groups listed in the expanding LGBTAIQQO identity camp is ascribed with political meaning and is often the subject of internecine debate among the marginalized groups. To characterize this debate as fraught would not be an overstatement, and those whom are most in need of the support of the movement take this debate quite seriously. The authors of this biblio-graphy have this same serious commitment and strive for inclusion and respect. The mission of this bibliography is not one of reclamation, nor does it presume to be exclusive. The contributors and editors have gener-ally used the categories, definitions, and names used by the creators of the underlying sources when possible. The work of the bibliography—of describing scholarship related to the law and sexual orientation and gender identities—cannot happen efficiently without using labels, and we hope our readers recognize the tensions inherent in labelling groups’ identities. I recognize that language is constantly changing. For example, only a few years ago, it was thought polite and appropriate to inquire as to the pronouns a person preferred. Currently, a better practice to ask what pro-nouns a person uses. Simple considerations such as these indicate respect and openness. As gender identity awareness and acceptance rapidly increases, vocabulary and best practices among the cisgender—gender normative folks—will likely change just as rapidly. Consequently, search terms will change over time, reflecting the linguistic changes in culture. Many of the categories that are described or addressed in this biblio-graphy, including those associated with sex, gender, sexuality, and race, are commonly described as socially constructed.9 Judith Butler’s scholar-ship suggests that an individual’s gender is performed, and thus created or                                                      6 Cassie Herbert, Precarious Projects: The Performative Structure of Reclamation, 52 LANGUAGE SCI. 131, 133 (2015). 7 Id. at 134. 8 Id. at 136.  9 See Eyundayo B.

Names Are Important xli   manifested, by the actions of the individual.10 As identities are internal-ized, they are also materialized, or “produced within the material body.”11 Just as identity is constructed it may also be fluid, such that a person may identify as a lesbian for years and later identify as heterosexual.12 A change in action or body may reflect a changed identity. More recently, authors such as Heath Fogg Davis are questioning directly whether we need gender categories at all.13 By naming aspects of identity and finding or building community around those aspects of identity, including sex, race, gender, ability, religion, we risk excluding others. Intersectionality recognizes that the interplay of multiple points of identity, such as race and gender or gender and sexuality, leads individuals who share one element of identity to have significantly different experiences.14 When a single identity, or a single aspect of identity, becomes a monolith, the nuance and diversity of experience is over-shadowed. Authors may use acronyms LGBT, LGBTQ, or LGBTQI, in an effort to be inclusive and recognize the diversity of experience. However, use of those acronyms for convenience without also including meaningful discus-                                                     10 JUDITH BUTLER, GENDER TROUBLE: FEMINISM AND THE SUBVERSION OF IDENTITY (2001).

Lawler notes, “The very meaning we give to the body—for example, the fact that we understand it in terms of ‘nature’ at all—are themselves social meanings, and gender is performatively produced, at least in part through the body.” Id.

If an article uses the acronym LGBT, but is primarily about sexual orientation and, for example, only mentions transgender identity at the initial time that the acronym is written, it would be annotated in the section addressing sexual orientation and specific legal issues. An article that primarily addresses gender identity and/or trans issues would be annotated in the section about gender identity and the law, even though it might also address briefly issues of sexual orientation. The hope is that researchers will find the resources more quickly through this framework. The following is a glossary with contemporary definitions of the groups and terms mentioned at various points in the bibliography. Please note that the glossary and bibliography do not mean to take a position in any debate or place a higher value on a particular member/group.  Allosexual: Has been used to refer to someone who experiences sexual attraction. As of this writing, there is no consensus as to whether allosexual is a preferred term; some people find it demeaning.16 Asexual(ity): Refers to a person who does not experience sexual attraction or interest.17 BDSM: Used to describe both a sexual identity and a set of sexual practices which are distinguished “by explicit, negotiated power differen-tials, with a ‘top’ or ‘dominant’ person guiding interaction and a ‘bottom’ or ‘submissive’ individual following instructions or receiving sensation from the dominant (citation omitted). For most, but not all, practitioners,                                                      15 Eric C. Christiansen, Substantive Equality and Sexual Orientation: Twenty Years of Gay and Lesbian Rights Adjudication Under the South African Constitution, 49 CORNELL INT’L L.J. 565, 615 (2016). Christiansen describes his choice to focus his article narrowly on gay and lesbian rights and calls for additional sociological and legal research on South African constitutional law regarding the rights of bisexuals, transgender, and intersex individuals. 16 About “Allosexual,” ASEXUAL VISIBILITY & EDUC.

Names Are Important xliii   BDSM has an erotic appeal and takes place within a sexualised encoun-ter.”18 BDSM refers to the following overarching elements: bondage-discipline, domination-submission, and sadism and masochism.19 Bisexual: “A person who has the capacity to form enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attractions to those of the same gender or to those of another gender. People may experience this attraction in differing ways and degrees over their lifetime. Bisexual people need not have had specific sexual experiences to be bisexual; in fact, they need not have had any sexual experience at all to identify as bisexual.”20 Demisexual: Refers to “[s]omeone who can only experience sexual attrac-tion after an emotional bond has been formed. This bond does not have to be romantic in nature.”21 Cisgender: Refers those who are not transgender.22 Note that some object to the use of the word cisgender on the basis that its use reinforces gender binaries (transgender and cisgender), leaving no room for those who do not identify as either cisgender or transgender. Gay: Refers to people who are physically, romantically, or emotionally attracted to people of the same sex. Sometimes this term is used to refer specifically to men or those who identify as men who are also attracted to men, though the term is also used to refer to women or those who identify as women who are also attracted to women.23                                                      18 Megan R.

Gender identity is not necessarily the same as sex assigned or presumed at birth.”24 Gender Queer: Some people use this term to describe their experience of gender identity or expression “as falling out side the categories of man and woman. They may define their gender as falling somewhere in between man and woman, or they may define it as wholly different from these terms.” Non-binary may also be used.25 Gray-Sexuality or Gray-Asexuality: Describes individuals who identify “with the area between asexuality and sexuality.”26 May also be referred to as Gray-A. Heterosexual: Describes a person who is physically, romantically, and/or emotionally attracted to people of the opposite sex.27  Heteronormative: Compliance with culturally determined heterosexual roles and the underlying assumption that heterosexuality is ‘natural’ or ‘normal.’ It is also described as an invisible force that shapes expectations about behavior and privileges those who fulfill heterosexual expecta-tions.28 Heteronormativity “allows cultural heterosexism and heterosexist prejudice to exist.”29                                                                                                                        winfrey-laura-dern/101021608/.

Names Are Important xlv   Homonormative: “Compliance of homosexuals with the norms and values of heterosexuality, which is seen as the price of inclusion.”30 Homo-normativity enforces gender and sexual norms31 and “creates a depoliti-cizing effect on queer communities as it rhetorically remaps and recodes freedom and liberation in terms of privacy, domesticity, and consump-tion.”32 Intersex: The condition of having been born with “a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit with the typical definitions of female or male.”33 Intersex anatomy may manifest in a range of ways, including appearing externally female while having male-typical anatomy inside or having mixed XX and XY chromosomes. Alternatively, one’s anatomy may not be apparently intersex at birth, but may be discovered later in life or after death.34 Having an intersex identity or condition is distinct from being having a transgender or transsexual identity.35 A person with an intersex condition is identified typically by an external person such as a parent or physician who “notice[s] something unusual about their bodies,”36 while a transgender or transsexual person has an internal experience of gender identity that differs from others with similar sexual or reproductive anatomies.37 Kink: Although kink may include BDSM, it “has a broader definition that encompasses fetishism and other forms of alternative sexual expres-sions.”38                                                      30 Chantal Nadeau, Courage, Postimmunity Politics, and the Regulation of the Queer Subject, 23 IND.

Also, people often use this term to express fluid identities and orientations.43 Queer is also often associated with a transgressive perspective on sexuality, gender, and/or society. See also Gender Queer. SM: Sometimes referred to as S&M, sadomasochism, including both sadism and masochism, “describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting or suffering pain and humiliation within a consensual scenario.”44 Sex: “Refers to a person’s biological characteristics.

These identities refer to a person’s emotional or sexual attraction to another person.46 Sexuality: An umbrella term, sexuality can refer to a person’s sexual identity in relation to others, also described as sexual orientation, which may include heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual, etc.47 More broadly, it may be described as “the quality of being sexual.”48 Transgender: An umbrella term used to describe people whose gender identity (inner sense of being male, female, or something else) differs from their assigned or presumed sex at birth.49 Included under this umbrella are identities such as transsexuals, cross-dressers, androgynous people, gen-derqueers, non-binary people, and gender non-conforming people.50 Transsexual: A person whose sex assigned at birth differs from their internal gender identity. Transsexual people often may alter their bodies through hormones or surgery.51                                                      45 A Note on Terminology—Addressing Sexual Orientation and Sex and/Or Gender Identity Discrimination, AUSTRALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION (2011), https://www.human rights.gov.au/publications/section-3-note-terminology-addressing-sexual-orientation-and-sex-andor-gender-identity.
