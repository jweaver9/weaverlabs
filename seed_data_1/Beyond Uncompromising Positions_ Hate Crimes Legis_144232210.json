IntroductionWe live in an age of political rhetoric and posturing that is need-lessly rigid and quite harmful. Disagreements more apparent thanreal too often are manufactured by overstatement, overdefensive-ness, and uncompromising wish lists for a perfect world. In a soci-ety beset by conflict, there may be nothing more tragicallydestructive than a failure to acknowledge common ground.New York State has suffered the effects of extremist politicalposturing and rhetoric, as State Senate Republicans long haveblocked efforts to enact a bill that would create the new offense ofbias-motivated crime.' At the same time, gay and lesbian advo-cates, through our own posturing, have undermined the prospectthat conservatives would support laws having anything to do withgay rights. Yet, there is common ground for conservatives and gayrights advocates, and that common ground is the proposed bias-crimes legislation.The proposed legislation would make a person guilty of a bias-motivated crime when a jury determines beyond a reasonabledoubt that a robbery, assault, or murder was perpetrated becauseof the victim's race, religion, national origin, gender, disability, age,* Professor of Law, New York Law School; co-chair, Board of Directors, NewYork City Gay & Lesbian Anti-Violence Project.1. N.Y.S.B. 4842,215th Gen. Ass. (1993), introduced in the New York State Sen-ate by Senator Roy Goodman on May 3, 1993, which \"amend(s) the criminal proce-dure law, the penal law and the civil rights law, in relation to strengthening civil rightsprotections and to make bias related violence or intimidation a criminal offense.\" S.4842 defines \"Bias related violence in the first degree as follows:A person is guilty of bias related violence or intimidation in the first degreewhen, with the intent to deprive an individual or group of individuals of theexercise of civil rights because of the individual's or group of individual'srace, creed, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, or sexual orientation,such person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes the death of an-other individual.1097FORDHAM URBAN LAW JOURNAL [Vol. XXIor sexual orientation.2 Recent incidents of violence motivated byracism, anti-semitism, and homophobia underscore that the prob-lem of bias-motivated violence is quite real.3 It should not be newsto anyone that the bonds linking us in a common social enterpriseare strained; that historic hate and prejudice are being inflamed bypolitical change and hard times;4 that some young males, insecurein their own identities and immature in their sense of social respon-sibility, are increasingly venting their inherited bigotries throughgames of stalking and assaulting human prey.' Indeed, all of us areincreasingly vulnerable to bias-motivated attack, whether on Chris-topher Street, the Brooklyn Bridge, Howard Beach, Staten Island,Long Island, or Main Street in Poughkeepsie, Albany, or Buffalo.Despite the prevalence of bias-motivated violence, and despitethe State Assembly's passage of the proposed legislation during its1994 session, conservative Republicans in the State Senate blockedthe bias-crimes bill yet again. This conservative opposition seemsodd, however, because Republicans long have claimed to be theparty of law and order. Indeed, Richard Nixon declared in 1968that freedom from violent crime is \"the first civil right of everyAmerican. '' 6 Furthermore, crime is once again a first-priority is-sue, as it was a generation ago.7The core Republican objection to the bias-crimes bill has focusedon the inclusion of crimes motivated by anti-gay bias.8 To providespecial criminalization for crime motivated by anti-gay bias, theyfear, would be to step down a slippery slope leading to virtuallyunlimited civil rights for gay men and lesbians.9 As Republican2.

But, as the Supreme Court recently held, providing special criminalization10981994] BEYOND UNCOMPROMISING POSITIONSSenator Guy Velella declared, \"It opens up a Pandora's Box. Ourconcern is opening up a whole area of gay rights in teaching.Teachers would have rights to be homosexual and advocate thatthat is an acceptable way of life.\"'10These concerns are misplaced. One can be committed to secur-ing for gay men and lesbians \"the first civil right of every Ameri-can,\" 1' without being committed to every civil right for gay menand lesbians.Section II of this Essay suggests four reasons why conservativeRepublicans should enthusiastically support the very hate-crimeslegislation they have been blocking, despite its inclusion of crimesmotivated by anti-gay bias. Section III argues that the confronta-tional rhetoric of many gay rights advocates has undermined pros-pects for political progress, and suggests that open dialoguebetween gay rights advocates and conservatives is preferable tothe now-prevalent rigid posturing. This Essay concludes that hate-crimes legislation can be embraced by both conservatives and gayrights advocates without advancing or inhibiting either group'sbroader political agenda.II. Hate-Crimes Legislation and Conservative ValuesLegislation that imposes a special penalty when a defendant isfound beyond a reasonable doubt to have selected his crime victimbecause of the victim's race, creed, color, national origin, sex, disa-bility, age, or sexual orientation, serves the values of conservativesin the following four ways:A. Enforcing Ordered Liberty through the Rule of LawThose who commit hate-crimes directly challenge the fundamen-tal conservative idea that the state has a monopoly right to vindi-cate social norms through the use of force. Perhaps unlike othercriminals, hate-motivated criminals believe that their acts of assaultactually serve the community's morality, or even some higher mo-for crimes motivated by the race, religion, gender or sexual orientation of the victimdoes not impinge on the First Amendment's protected speech.

Con-vention, supra note 6.1099FORDHAM URBAN LAW JOURNAL [Vol. XXIrality. 12 Whether the motivation is hatred of gays or blacks orJews, a common bond among hate-motivated criminals is a sense ofdoing battle for good over evil. Put another way, these criminalsare vigilantes in pursuit of justice as they see it.'3 From their per-spective, the crucial point is their belief that they are doing justice.From a conservative's perspective, the crucial point should be thatthey are vigilantes.Rejecting vigilante justice does not require condemning the val-ues underlying the vigilante's decision to act. One can be anti-gay,yet still support the criminalization of those who advocate anti-gayvalues through the vigilantism of hate-motivated assault. Indeed,conservative Republicans can support hate-crimes legislation as apointed affirmation of the basic conservative principle that ours is asociety of ordered liberty governed by the rule of law.Liberty is not ordered unless the state alone uses force to vindi-cate society's norms. The rule of law requires the enforcement ofsociety's norms through regular and orderly procedures to ensurethat only those who actually have violated the laws are punished.Thus, if homosexuals are to be regulated-a goal shared by hate-motivated criminals and many conservative Republicans-it mustbe through orderly public procedures, not through flailing am-bushes committed by private individuals on the public's streets.14B. Securing Commerce and Productive EnterpriseConservatives should support hate-crimes legislation becausehate-motivated crime disrupts the social peace and security that al-low commerce and productive enterprise to flourish. People mustfeel free to venture from their homes into the streets, to participatein economic production and consumption, and simply to enjoy thevariety of society's characteristics and creations. Ordinary street12. See, e.g., GARY DAVID COMSTOCK, VIOLENCE AGAINST LESBIANS AND GAYMEN 19 (1991) (quoting former gay-basher as believing that he was \"waging... a kindof holy war . . . [and] doing the world a favor,\" and that \"aggression against [thehomosexual] was viewed as a virtue\" because the homosexual is \"so universally de-spised\"). Comstock also cited a youth center counselor who said about the murderersof gay men, \"[u]nlike other residents who had committed their crimes as a means ofrebelling against society, the slayers of Charlie Howard [a gay man) committed theirsas a way of being accepted by it.\" Id. at 92. In addition, a police inspector reportedthat four young men who beat a gay man to death \"seem to regard the beating-up ofwhomever they consider sex deviates as a civic duty.\" Id. at 183, n. 54.13. Cf. Edward I. Koch, \"Law, Order, and Justice,\" 18 CONG. REC. H14, 020 (dailyed. April 24, 1972)(statement of Rep. Koch).14. Studies suggest that lesbians and gay men suffer violent attacks at three to fourtimes the rate at which the general population does. COMSTOCK, supra note 12, at 55.11001994] BEYOND UNCOMPROMISING POSITIONScrime destroys a sense of security in society and, therefore, hindersthis productive social activity. Hate-motivated crime compoundsthe fears of victimization and the pressures to avoid danger. Poten-tial targets must fear not only the ordinary assault, but also thehate-motivated assault against a human bull's eye.Hate-motivated crime broadly distributes these anti-social ef-fects. Not only gay people are potential targets of anti-gay crime.People who might be wrongly perceived as homosexual also arevulnerable as potential victims, and subject to a climate of fear. Inshort, hate-motivated crime broadly discourages travel, commerce,and the ordinary enjoyment of the streets-the fundamental bene-fits of society that conservatives view as government's central legit-imate concern.Enactment of the federal Civil Rights Act of 196415 was facili-tated by a similar perspective. Certain southern conservatives ac-ceded to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 not on the ground that racismis morally wrong, but because racial discrimination undermineseconomic productivity. Similarly, conservatives can support hate-crimes legislation not on the ground that homophobia is morallywrong, but to secure the commerce and productive enterprise thatare the fruits of ordered liberty from which society broadlybenefits.C. Deterring Hate-Crimes EffectivelyConservatives should support hate-crimes legislation because ofthe prospects for successful deterrence. People motivated by prej-udice and hate are particularly amenable to signals from higher au-thority, according to social scientists. 16 These \"authoritarianpersonalities\" seek rules with which to comply, and feel most com-fortable when confronted with rules backed by authority.' 7Many hate-motivated criminals are young, middle-class, whitemales,'18 most of whom might well be self-avowed law-enforce-15. 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000(d)-2000(h)(6).16. See COMSTOCK, supra note 12, at 116 (Adolescents committing anti-gay crime\"are essentially conformist, and superficially rebellious.\").17. See T.W. ADORNO, ELSE FRENKEL-BRUNSWIK, DANIEL J. LEVINSON, R.NEvrrr SANFORD, THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY (1950); GORDON W. ALL-PORT, THE NATURE OF PREJUDICE (1958). See also JOHN P. DECECCO, ED.,HOMOPHOBIA IN AMERICAN SOCIETY 70 (1984).18. According to Gary Comstock, \"[p]erpetrators are not only predominantlymale and white, but just as likely, or even more likely, to be middle-class; good intheir classes; involved in school and community activities, organizations, and athletics;popular friendly, and sociable; enrolled in college preparatory courses in high schoolor enrolled in college; and/or in the military.\" COMSTOCK, supra note 12, at 106.1101FORDHAM URBAN LAW JOURNAL [Vol. XXIment-minded conservatives. This profile suggests a cognitivebreach between the hate-motivated criminals' perception of theiracts and their understanding of crime. 19 To a significant extent, thethreat of punishment under ordinary assault legislation might notdeter their acts of vigilante justice, because they do not think oftheir acts as crime warranting punishment.Deterrence is not simply a matter of threatening stringent penal-ties for committing a prohibited act. Although the severity ofthreatened punishment is an important element for achieving de-terrence, another significant variable is the degree of certainty thatthe threatened punishment will be imposed, as is the extent towhich potential criminals have knowledge and understanding ofthe threatened punishment for prohibited acts.2\"The New York State Senate Republicans have argued that thebest way to deter hate-motivated crime is to increase the penaltiesfor all assaults.2 ' This might be correct. One might doubt, how-ever, that existing law has failed to deter many hate-motivatedcriminals because these felons view the present threat of three tofifteen years in prison as a good trade for the choice to bash a gayperson's head.12 Rather, hate-motivated vigilantes may committheir acts of violence because they fail to understand that their actsare, indeed, criminal. Thus, simply increasing the penalties for allassaults will do nothing to promote an understanding that vigilante\"justice\" is indeed criminal assault. The vigilantes' failure of un-derstanding is rooted in confusing their views about right andwrong with the right to enforce their views through assault.Thus, the state is unlikely to succeed in deterring its potentialvigilantes unless its message of deterrence is forcefully and clearlystated. That clarity of message is lacking when the state refuses tocondemn the vigilante's actions because of sympathy-or per-ceived sympathy- with the vigilante's motives. Conservative op-position to a hate crimes law that rests on a fear of opening the\"Pandora's Box\"'23 of gay rights sends the message that there is noadequate distinction between a gay person's right to teach and a19. See COMSTOCK, supra note 12, at 91-2. Comstock also writes, \"[A]ssailants donot exhibit what are customarily thought of as criminal attitudes and behaviors.Many conform to or are. models of middle-class respectability.\" Id. at 231-32.20. See, e.g., SUE T. REID, CRIME AND CRIMINOLOGY, at 485-89 (3d ed. 1982).21. Hugh Murray, What's in a Name?, NEWSDAY, Oct. 24, 1988, at 52.22. Assault in the first degree is a class C felony in New York. See N.Y.PENAL L.ยง 120.10 (McKinney 1987), which is subject to a sentence of imprisonment from threeto fifteen years. See N.Y.PENAL L. ยง 70.00(2)(c)(McKinney 1987).23. See supra note 10 and accompanying text.11021994] BEYOND UNCOMPROMISING POSITIONSgay person's right not to be assaulted. It sends the message thatthe goal of condemning homosexuality justifies the means ofvigilantism.Even more than a state that seeks to protect a broad range ofcivil rights for gay people, a state that seeks to reinforce anti-gayvalues must condemn the anti-gay vigilante's means, or risk sacri-ficing its commitment to ordered liberty through the rule of law.2 4To ensure that vigilantism is deterred, the state must announceclearly and without reservation that those who commit assaults mo-tivated by hate-in other words, those who assault in pursuit ofvigilante justice-have committed a crime and are subject to strin-gent criminal penalties. A state can send an unambiguous messageof deterrence by singling out these bias-motivated crimes for spe-cial punishment through hate-crimes legislation. z5D. Protecting People About Whom Conservatives Care -Both Potential Victims and PerpetratorsOnce hate-crimes legislation is enacted and achieves an incre-ment of deterrence, conservatives may benefit personally. The po-tential victims spared a painful assault might be their own children.Perhaps more to the point, the potential perpetrators spared acriminal record and punishment might be their Own children. 6Surely it is better for the sons and daughters of middle-class con-servatism to be deterred by an unambiguous threat of greater pun-ishment, and thereby to avoid a criminal record and punishmentaltogether, than, to commit a hate-crime subject to punishmentonly as ordinary assault. Thus, concern about potential hate-moti-vated criminals can supplement concern for their potential victims.Both concerns can lead one to conclude that New York's youthshould be inculcated with the message that hate-motivated crime24. Gary Comstock lists four factors underlying anti-gay violence as dispropor-tionately committed by young males. The fourth factor refers to society's \"institution-alized permission\" for violent behavior against gay men and lesbians. See COMSTOCK,supra note 12, at 118-19. It is important to break down the nature of this \"institution-alized permission\" into its two components of values and methods. It is important forboth anti-gay conservatives and for gay rights advocates to recognize that one can beanti-gay in the context of public policy, yet still believe that it is criminal to pursueanti-gay values through vigilantism.25. Hate-criminals have been encouraged by a sense that their act would not beprosecuted because the \"friendly cop\" would overlook it. See COMSTOCK, supra note12, at 19-20.26. For many, hate-motivated attacks are their only involvement in criminal activ-ity. See COMSTOCK, supra note 12, at 92.1103FORDHAM URBAN LAW JOURNAL [Vol. XXIis, indeed, crime; that all have a right to walk the streets safely; andthat all benefit from ordered liberty through the rule of law.III. Toward Dialogue: Why Gay Rights Advocates ShouldModerate Our RhetoricWith all these conservative reasons for hate-crimes legislation,why the persistent resistance? Although homophobia is surely onereason, people like Guy Velella might fear opening a \"Pandora'sBox\"' 27 in part because of the manner in which much of the gaycommunity handles political opposition. It sometimes seems thatunless a politician is one hundred percent pure for gay and lesbiancivil rights, he or she is deemed a mortal enemy who must be onehundred percent opposed and denounced.28 When gay rights areportrayed in such all or nothing terms, one should not be surprisedthat conservative Republicans might fear sliding to the bottom of aslippery slope if they recognize that gay people, like everyone else,have a right to personal security on the public's streets.Too many lesbian and gay activists may be unwilling to take thefirst step away from our pure, ideal world, even though doing socould facilitate the first step from a too imperfect reality towardsomething better. We perhaps preach too much to the converted,while alienating those who need conversion. Although this mightmake us feel better in the short run, it is not otherwise productive.Advocates of civil rights for gay men and lesbians should cultivatesupport from those who do not fully embrace our cause-and fromthose who largely reject our cause-by opening dialogue withthem.Opening dialogue requires understanding the range of our oppo-nents' values. It requires asking how we can demonstrate that thepolicies we seek actually serve conservative values as well as ours.Opening dialogue requires moving from reflexive condemnationsof our opponents' errors toward positions and rhetoric that are27. See supra note 10 and accompanying text.28. Carl Siciliano, Uncivil Religion, NEWSDAY, May 10, 1994, at 31. If a policecommissioner or a mayoral candidate walks in the St. Patrick's Day Parade, he isdeemed anti-gay. A President who bows to political reality, despite expending pre-cious political capital on gays in the military, and despite being an unprecedentedpresidential voice for a homosexual's place in the American community, is demonizedas a weak, lying traitor. A politician who opposes a particular \"Rainbow Curricu-lum\" might be condemned as a lost cause, despite being open to a tolerance curricu-lum that better fits certain parental sensibilities.11041994] BEYOND UNCOMPROMISING POSITIONSmore measured and textured. 29 However unpleasant these stepsmight be, and however much patience they would require, they arenecessary for communication. And communication is necessary forpersuasion. And persuasion is necessary for progress.IV. ConclusionThis Essay has presented four arguments for hate-crimes legisla-tion that gay and lesbian advocates can make without compromis-.ing our integrity, and that conservatives can embrace withoutcompromising theirs. A hate-crimes law predicated on these argu-ments neither advances nor inhibits a broader civil rights agenda.Rather than debate the hate-crimes law as a gay rights measure,conservatives and gay rights advocates can declare a truce, servethe interests of the entire community, and enact the bill based onthe consensus principles of ordered liberty through the rule of law.This is not unprincipled compromise. It is, rather, intelligent poli-tics that, in working with the world as it is, seeks to make it better.29. For example, opening dialogue might require a decision not to condemn asnecessarily beyond redemption those who support the Ancient Order of Hibernians,or those who oppose the Rainbow Curriculum.1105",
