    "fullText": "Creating a Sexual Self in Heteronormative Space: Integrations and\nImperatives Amongst Spiritual Seekers at the Findhorn Community\nby Elizabeth Dinnie and Kath Browne\nMacaulay Land Use Research Institute\nSociological Research Online, 16 (1) 7\n<http://www.socresonline.org.uk/16/1/7.html> \n10.5153/sro.2287\nReceived: 20 Jul 2010     Accepted: 11 Feb 2011    Published: 28 Feb 2011\nAbstract\nIntersections between religion and sexuality are coming onto social science agendas. However, this has\npredominantly been in terms of its treatment by mainstream religions, particularly Christianity and Islam,\nand thus in contexts traditionally hostile to lesbian, gay and bi sexualities (LGB). This article extends this\nby exploring identities and contestations of sexuality within activities that have variously been described\nas 'New Age' or 'spiritual'. Considering the experiences and interactions of spiritual seekers avoids a non-\nsocial conceptualisation of 'New Age' which views spirituality primarily as an individualistic experience. The\nspeciﬁc focus here is the Findhorn Community, a spiritual community and demonstration eco-village in\nScotland. We ﬁnd that seekers' attempt to resist labelling and categorisation through creating and using\nindividualised sexual (as well as spiritual) expressions. However, tensions stemming from\n(heteronormative) interactions within the Findhorn community show that sexual diversity and labelling\ncontinues to matter. The research demonstrates that sexual ﬂuidity is a privileged position to occupy, but\nthat it is also ultimately unsustainable in that ﬂuid identity becomes re-subsumed in heteronormativity and,\neventually, individuals have to come out and identify all over again. The continuing imperative for some\nLGB people to deﬁne themselves as/with 'something', is thus apparent even within supposedly\nindividualized settings and belief systems. Such positioning questions the individuality that is presumed to\ndeﬁne New Age spiritualities, and shows how categories of lesbian, gay and bisexual also continue to be\ndeployed at the same time as they are resisted and reinterpreted.\nKeywords: Individuality; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual; Sexuality; Spirituality; Findhorn\nCommunity\nIntroduction\n1.1 In recent years much critical attention has been paid to the increase in religious individualism see\nHeelas 2008; Heelas and Woodhead 2005; Lynch 2007). However lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB)[1]\npeople are unusual in that they/we may not choose such individualism so much as have it thrust upon\nthem/us (Wilcox 2003: 16). The rejection, or potential rejection, should sexual identities be visible or\napparent by certain religious institutions can mean that for some LGB people forging individual religious\nand spiritual paths becomes a necessary route to religious/spiritual fulﬁlment. LGB people who chose (or\nindeed are forced into) particular spiritual/religious paths can offer important insights into contemporary\nmanifestations of alternative sexualities and ‘individualised’ spiritual paths. The main contention of this\npaper is that although many of those engaged in individual spiritual practices may strive for holistic\npathways where sexuality and spirituality are interconnected there continues to be an imperative to engage\nwith sexual identities in ways that can be at odds with the ways in which spiritual lives are understood. In\nan era of sexual ‘equalities’ and ﬂuidities we are contending that sexual identities continue to matter (see\nalso Heaphy 2008 and Moore 2010), despite popular and academic questionings of collective and ﬁxed\nidentiﬁcations, be they around sexuality or spirituality. Not only do individuals align to spiritual\ncollectivities, as we will argue with Findhorn spaces, categories of lesbian, gay and bisexual also continue\nto be deployed at the same time as they are resisted and reinterpreted. This extends work that asks for the\nsigniﬁcance of collectivities by noting that such collectivities and interdependencies (Moore, 2010) are in\nthis case mediated through, and indeed as we will show with regard to sexual identiﬁcations, at times\nrequired for spiritual spaces.\n1.2 This paper begins by exploring writing that interlinks lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) lives andspirituality. Following an outline of the methods and the place of this paper in the Queer Spiritual Spaces\nProject, we examine the complexity of lived experiences of lesbians, bisexual women and gay men at\nFindhorn, a spiritual community in Scotland. Resistance to labels and categories deﬁning or limiting\nsexuality lead to the expression of novel and unusual sexual identities outside the hegemonic identities\nlesbian, gay and bisexual. Yet, ironically, such creations and individualised renderings of sexuality also\nhave unintended consequences. Our data leads us to conclude that an individualized and ﬂuid,\nspiritualized sexuality obscures the ways in which identiﬁcation as a certain kind of sexual subject\ncontinues to be important within knowable communities and modes of belonging. Tensions arise in\nparticular when heteronormative[2] assumptions are revealed in ways that continue to regulate sexuality in\nthese ‘open’ spaces.\nDiverging Roads? Sociology, Religion and Sexuality\n2.1 In general the sociology of religion has paid little attention to the religiosity of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual\nand Trans people. Although this situation is changing, with sociologists demonstrating that religion and\nspirituality are important resources for many LGBT people (Hunt 2009; Yip 2003; Wilcox 2002; 2003), within\nand beyond sociology much discussion and research continues to be dominated by the ‘homosexuality\ndebates’ in the Anglican communion (e.g. Vanderbeck et al 2010; Nixon 2008; Keenan 2008; see also\nBrowne et al 2010). The lack of work in the sociology of religion on the experiences of LGBT people,\ncoupled with a focus on the homosexuality debates, can leave the impression that many religions are\n‘homophobic’ (as well as biphobic and transphobic- although these are less well remarked upon); a\nsituation which is in direct contrast to the increasing tolerance and visibility of LGBT people in secular\norganizations (Yip 2008). Conversely, there has been a rejection by LGBT groups, individuals and people of\nreligion in speciﬁc forms (see Browne et al 2010; Yip 2003; Wilcox, 2002; 2003). The perception that LGBT\npeople are not religious, coupled with the inﬂuence of Marxism within LGBT studies, means that there are\nfew studies of LGBT religiosity (Wilcox 2003: 17), particularly related to ‘New Age’ or alternative\nspirituality[3]. While other social institutions have received attention, for example the family and marriage,\nspirituality has remained a neglected area; discussions of religious choice and individualism have\nneglected restriction in this ‘supposedly open market’ (Wilcox 2002: 498).\n2.2 However, any discussion of sexuality and spirituality needs to account for recent moves by queer\nscholars to unsettle the master categories of gay and lesbian, in part by shifting attention from identities to\npractices (Corber and Valocchi 2003). Rather than viewing the afﬁrmations of identity as wholly liberating,\nqueer theorists in particular, have theorised these as disciplinary, normalising and regulating structures.\nApproaching identities as multiple, unstable and regulatory may suggest the undermining of gay politics\n(and sexual identiﬁcations upon which they rest) but for queer theorists it also suggests new and\nproductive possibilities (Seidman 1996, 12). Understanding sexuality as a productive system of regulation,\nscholars have explored the possibilities of other forms of sexual-social relationships, as well as the\nentanglement of sexuality with other social differences. Heteronormativity, understood here as the aligning\nof genders and sexuality (as well as race, class and ability) in ways that both create and privilege certain\nideals as ‘normal’, has been critiqued and challenged by queer scholars, ﬁnding heterosexuality (and\nhomosexuality) to be ﬂuid and performed (Butler 1990). Moreover, in an era of ‘equalities’ and the\ndomestication of (non-threatening) lesbians and gay men, the normalisation of certain gay and lesbian lives\nhas also come under critical scrutiny (Warner 1999;Stychin 2006).\n2.3 Following Butler (1990) and others, there has been a move away from naming and categorising towards\nmore ﬂuid engagements with desire, performativities and encounters. This has particular implications for\ncollectives and personal identities built on sexual categories. For example, once a ﬁrst step towards\npersonal and collective transformation, ‘outness’ as an empowering form of personal and political\nidentiﬁcation has been challenged in recent literature. Arguing that the imperative to ‘come out’ may not\nhave desired political effects, authors point to how it can be used as a trope to marginalise, exclude and\nexpress other forms of prejudice (see for example, O’Brien; Vidal-Ortiz; Decena 2008.). Coming out can\nhave an empowering effect on individuals (Valentine & Skelton 2003), yet the shift towards a regime of\ncompulsory disclosure has been rendered problematic. Coming out is co-present and constitutive of\ncontemporary lesbian and gay performativities such that psychological deﬁciency, not political or sexual\ndissent, has been used to explain the behaviour of people who cannot or will not come out (Decena 2008:\n406). Patton (1993) argues that coming out reshapes and forms political subjects. Coming out does not\nreveal a true self that was hidden and psychologically impaired by secrecy, but it links the selves thus\nconstituted to moral mandates; ‘identities carry with them a requirement to act, which is felt as “what a\nperson like me does”’ (Patton 1993: 147), as well as to other selves forming collectivities and belonging.\nLegitimacy gained through gay identiﬁcations and the requirement for an unfailing repetition of a ‘homo-self’\nat every possible iteration are being contested (Vidal-Ortiz 2008: 488). Yet, as this paper will argue, visible\nsexual identiﬁcations and collectivities continue to be important in questioning pervasive heteronormative\nassumptions, such that ‘coming out’ and labelling oneself as gay/lesbian/bisexual remains a political act.\nIndeed our data links with others (see for example, Kirsch 2000), who question the possibilities of queer\nthinking for delivering social change and instead notes the place and importance of recognition, community\nand belonging. This however is not to deny how through processes such as celebrating ‘coming out’ some\nforms of ‘homosexuality’ are legitimised (some would say (homo) normalised) - whereas others remain\ndeviant and beyond the realms of respectability and recognition.\n2.4 Sacred spaces, including churches, mosques, temples and synagogues, have often been\nheterosexualised in part through the exclusion of diverse forms of sexual and gender difference, including\nlesbian, gay, bi and trans identities and celebrations (Yip 2008: 8). For Christians and others raised in\n‘traditional’ religions (including Islam) same-sex attraction or trans identity can present the difﬁcult choice\nbetween religious commitment and gender/ sexual practices and identities (Browne et al 2009; Yip 2003;\nWilcox 2003: 10). Coming out can challenge Christian identiﬁcations (Wilcox 2002: 500). Although it could\nbe argued that there are polarised responses to this; with some people choosing religion and\nheteronormative lives, whilst others choosing LGBT lives rejecting religion, the research in this areasuggests that many compromise and negotiate around both aspects of these identities, practices and\nbeliefs (Gorman 1980; Thumma 1991). Yip (2003) argues that LGBT identities and religious lives are not\nnecessarily oppositional. For many negotiating potential opposition involves reinterpreting belief systems in\nsuch a way that alternative sexual identities, practices and lives and religious commitment are not just\ncompatible but are also intertwined. Recent studies have shown a move by those deﬁned as gay and\nlesbian to negotiate a religious identity based on the individualistic claim that ‘this is my religion too!’\n(Wilcox 2003: 13). Wilcox (2003) points out sexuality and spirituality can be closely linked, such that\n‘being’ gay/lesbian/bi and/or trans is considered a spiritual calling. In Britain Andrew Yip (1996; 1997) has\npointed out that a religiously rooted essentialism – the belief that ‘God made me this way’ – is an important\npart of the integration of gay men and lesbians in particular.\n2.5 Questioning the assumption of mutually exclusive sexual/spiritual identities, lives and practices allows\nsome LGBT people to integrate sexual/gender identity with traditional religious beliefs. For others who do\nnot seek to be part of such institutions, communities and belief systems yet seek to retain an element of\nthe sacred in their lives, one option is to turn to a more individualised spirituality. Spirituality can be\nappealing to LGBT people because it can reject the spiritual/sexual binary which has been used to create\nthe ‘homosexual sinner’ in traditional religions (Wilcox 2003; Tacey 2004) as we discuss further below.\nSuch a focus can result in the creation of unique and individual spiritual paths in ways that are different to\nthose who occupy normative sexual and gender subject positions. Yet, such individualisation is also\nquestioned by LGBT collectives as well as the desire for spiritual groupings in places such as Findhorn. In\norder to engage with spirituality and in this context LGB experiences and identiﬁcations (as there were no\nTrans people in the sample), it is necessary to move beyond the literatures that have worked at their\nseams to engage with broader contexts of sacred sexualities and queer thinking.\nSacred Sexualities: The Project of the Self\n2.6 Whilst multiple, divergent and contested, so-called ‘New Age’ spirituality offers insights into the\nconstruction of a spiritual self and is important in understanding contemporary manifestations of belief\nbeyond traditional religions. The term spirituality typically includes a number of overlapping, and\nsometimes contradictory, teachings that cover a wide range of activities many of which aim at the re-\ndiscovery of a lost sacredness in everyday events and objects, including the human self (Hunt 2003: 131).\nWith roots in nineteenth century esotericism, new religious movements of the 1970s, well-being culture of\nthe 1980s and indigenous and folk religions of pre-modernity, spirituality includes a diverse range of\npractices, beliefs and ways of life (Bruce 1996; Heelas 1996; Hunt 2003). Activities range from yoga to\ntantra, sculpting to gardening, Zen meditation to astroshamanism. Although diverse and multifaceted, often\ncentral to practices included under the ‘New Age’ emblem is the aspiration to re-discover a true self; a\ndivine core which is the true essence of the human spirit (Heelas 1996; Sutcliffe 1995).\n2.7 However, scholarly interpretations which view spirituality as fundamentally concerned with the inner life\noffer only a vague and loose deﬁnition for what is a bewildering variety of practices and groups. Recent\nstudies of New Age spirituality have challenged sociological orthodoxy which presents it as a realm in\nwhich the individual’s autonomous ability to act is paramount (see for example Wood & Bunn 2009; Aupers\nand Houtman 2006; Heelas 2006). Although recognising that connecting with an inner self is the main\npurpose of many, if not all, New Age activity, there is increasing recognition that there is more relationality,\nsocialization and strategy in the New Age milieu than previous scholars have allowed for. So although\nmany spiritual activities are concerned with the self there are powerful social forces, such as power\ndynamics and personal biography, acting upon and within the spiritual milieu which make spirituality much\nmore than a self-religion. The ‘self’ can thus be seen as an assemblage of inter-relationalities, stemming\nfrom practices that recreate forms of spiritualities (and sexualities), even those that emphasise the\nindividual.\n2.8 In contrast to some mainstream religious views of the self as inherently sinful or ﬂawed New Age\nspirituality sees the self as a manifestation of divine intelligence and energy (Lynch 2007: 55; Heelas\n2006). Rather than something to be controlled and disciplined, the self is inherently good; embodied\nexperiences are seen as valid sources of revelation about the divine, and the ongoing development of the\nself is seen as part of the wider divinely inspired unfolding of the cosmos (Lynch 2007; Sutcliffe and\nBowman 2000). This emphasis on the essential ‘goodness’ of the self resonates with the importance and\nautonomy accorded to the individual self in society more generally; a phenomena that Charles Taylor has\ncalled ‘the massive subjective turn of modern culture’ (Heelas and Woodhead 2005). Those who follow New\nAge spirituality thus seek to discover a ‘true’ self through liberation from oppressive and corrupting\nsocialized identities (Heelas 1996; Bruce 1996) rather than seeking to ﬁnd fulﬁlment through the enactment\nof idealized social roles (Heelas & Woodhead 2005). The idea of a ‘real’ divine self underlying social\nidentity can be read as a form of essentialism, a belief that at our core there is some immutable, ﬁxed\nessence untouched by culture or environment. As we shall discuss, this can create tension between\nspirituality and some expressions of sexuality.\n2.9 The holistic idea that the divine can be found everywhere, rather than the world being divided into\nsacred and profane, means that ‘deviant’ sexualities can be integrated into the whole of life and not left on\nthe margins as an embarrassing extra that we strive to repress or ignore (Tacey 2004: 114; Lynch 2007).\nSpiritual beliefs which bring sexuality into the sacred sphere can mean that LGBT people do not have to\nmake a choice between their beliefs and their sexuality/gender identity, as the latter can be integrated into\ntheir spiritual journey. However, as we will show, how these beliefs are manifest through the integration of\nsexuality, LGB identiﬁcations and the inter-relations at the site of the Findhorn community are not\nnecessarily straightforward or indeed ‘open’. Rather than ‘intersecting’ spiritualities and sexualities\nexploring tensions and overlaps (see Browne & Dinnie, 2010), we instead read sexual identiﬁcations\nthrough the way they are manifest in and in turn create spiritual spaces, and how spiritual spaces (re)form\nsexual identiﬁcations.Methods, Ethics and Context\n3.1 This research was undertaken as one case study for the Queer Spiritual Spaces project, funded under\nthe AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society programme. The project looks at the place of the sacred in the lives\nof LGBT people who are also members of non-dominant faith groups, including Quakers, Muslims,\nBuddhists, and the Non-aligned Spiritually Curious. It was undertaken by a research team, who employed\npost-doctoral research fellows to undertake four case studies (see Browne et al. 2010). Each case study\nexplored a range of issues that pertained to the relationships between sexual/gender identities and spiritual\npractices. The research was qualitative consisting of focus groups and interviews and was undertaken\nbetween April 2008-August 2008 (for further details see http://www.queerspiritualspaces.com). The data for\nthis paper came from the Findhorn case study and speciﬁcally arose from the complex intersections\nbetween spirituality and sexuality that were apparent in this case study. The data for this paper was\nanalysed by the authors and the paper was reviewed by the other researchers in this project. Analysis\nfollowed an inductive process; initial conceptual ideas suggested by the data led to further interrogation\nand reﬁnement of concepts as writing up progressed. Data for this paper was drawn from the initial themes\nand then the data further interrogated to explore the emerging concepts. For further details of the study and\nthe overlaps and intersections between the case studies please see Browne et al. (2009).\n3.2 For this case study eleven in-depth interviews and two focus groups (each consisting of 5\nparticipants)[4] were conducted by one of us with visitors and residents[5] of the Findhorn community, a\nspiritual education centre and demonstration ecovillage in Scotland (see also Browne & Dinnie 2010). The\nresearch was designed in accordance with ethical guidance set out by ESRC and AHRC. Participant\ninformation sheets were given to all participants and informed consent was obtained prior to the research\ntaking place. Pseudonyms have been used however the naming of Findhorn as the research site could\nmean that some participants are potentially identiﬁable. Nonetheless, given the size of Findhorn, the\nturnover of people and movement between positions within the community it would be difﬁcult to identify\nany speciﬁc individual in this study. In naming Findhorn and the position of participants within the\ncommunity we are following others who have researched and written about this site in this way (Sutcliffe\n2003; Sargisson 2000).\n3.3 Founded in 1962 the Findhorn community has become one of the most well-known spiritual centres of\nmodern times (Heelas 1996, Sutcliffe 2003). Originally a small group of people living together and quietly\ncommuning with nature Findhorn has become an international centre of spiritual education and ecological\ndemonstration with around 500 residents which annually attracts over 2,000 visitors to its residential\nworkshops and conferences (see http://www.ﬁndhorn.org). Located at two campuses in Moray, the\ncommunity consists of the Foundation (an education centre and the largest organization) and around 30\nsmall and single-operated businesses and services in such areas as holistic education, organic farming,\nenergy production, retailing, building, alternative therapies and healing, bed and breakfast and holiday\naccommodation, creative and performing arts and sustainable development (Dinnie 2008).\n3.4 The Foundation has a year-round programme of residential workshops, conferences and special events\nwhich since the early 1980s has included workshops for gay, lesbian and bisexual people. The absence of\ntrans should be noted here. Although there are some trans individuals at Findhorn this research did not\ncapture their experiences. Thus, rather than tokenistically use the category LGBT, we more accurately\nrepresent the sample using LGB.\n3.5 Such events include gay and lesbian experience week, an alternative to the standard experience week\n(an introduction to community life); women2women, a personal and spiritual inner journey for lesbians\n(Findhorn 2008); and gay men’s retreats at the community’s house on Iona on the west coast of Scotland.\n3.6 The idea of workshops for gay and lesbian people was at ﬁrst opposed by some community members.\nCriticisms voiced by others were recounted by George and included the idea that workshops ‘should be for\neveryone’ and if ‘we started having workshops for gay people we would end up having them for stamp\ncollectors’ (George, a participant in this research and long-term staff member of the Foundation). Early\nnotices for meetings to discuss the workshops were removed from community notice boards. Their\ndisappearance was interpreted by some residents as an esoteric ‘sign’ that there was no place for such\nworkshops at Findhorn, a convenient way to sideline homophobia or power struggles between different\ngroups within the community. In the summer of 2008 during the ﬁeldwork for this project there was also\nsome controversy when the lesbian and gay experience week was removed from the programme (see\nBrowne & Dinnie, 2010[6]). A community meeting was held to discuss not only the workshop but the issue\nof sexuality within the community more widely.\n3.7 The issue of sexuality touches on wider issues of authority, discipline and structure. Part of the\nproblem is that because the over-arching belief system emphasises that divinity is found within each\nperson then everyone can claim to have direct access to the truth (Bruce 2002). The problems that\nepistemological individualism raises for authority and decision making have been managed in various ways\nover the course of the community’s history and are only brieﬂy mentioned here (see also Rigby 1972;\nSutcliffe 1995; Dinnie 2008). For the ﬁrst few years of the community’s existence members were ﬁrmly\nunder the leadership of the founders, Peter and Eileen Caddy, a situation that could be seen to contradict\nthe belief system (Rigby 1972). As the community grew its main purpose changed from creating a way of\nlife to education and demonstration (Dinnie 2008). Having an educational purpose enables organizations to\nadopt a service relationship with wider society, rather than one based on opposition (Kanter 1972).\nDecision-making processes and community structures became more bureaucratic and the original\ncharismatic founders left. In recent years the boundaries around the Foundation (and hence the\ncommunity) have become more porous as proﬁt-orientated businesses have moved into the wider\ncommunity and new businesses have sprung up that were never part of the Foundation. The general trend\nthen has been one of privatization and decentralisation, so that rather than a single community Findhorn\ncan be seen as an association of many different groups and organizations congregated around a centralorganization (Riddell 1991; Metcalf 2004). Findhorn offers an important site to explore the interactions\nbetween sexuality and spirituality, particularly as this diversity attracts visitors as well as residents. The\nnext section will explore how LGB people discuss integrating their sexuality with a spiritual journey.\n‘It’s much more than sexual’: The problems with labels\n4.1 Moving beyond labels and the need for identities participants in this study expressed aspirations to\nintegrate sexuality as part of their spiritual journey. In this context, a foregrounded LGB sexuality can be\nperceived as problematic because it is constraining, as Lucinda, a wider community resident, describes;\nIn terms of my sexual identity it’s just Lucinda, so it is, and my ideal world is that I don’t see\nthe sex of the, the physical sex of the person.\nInterviewer: So would you use any labels, like lesbian, gay, queer?\nThey trigger me. I loathe them. I struggle with them. I think it’s because I’ve a fear of getting\ntied into the box. I think that it’s just labelling in general, because of my very rigid upbringing.\nVery structured. Very labelled, and it was if you were this you were always this, and there\nwas no space for changing it, and that is probably actually the basis of it, because when I\ncame here to Findhorn it was to get out of boxes. My sexuality is one thing that I still\nstruggle with, because I have balance in the rest of my life, but where my sexuality, its where\nmy rigid upbringing comes in. I’m either straight or I’m gay, I can’t be in-between, where,\nwhere I’m open to both. It’s either one or the other, which is my rigid upbringing, so that’s\nwhy I just use the label Lucinda because then it is whoever I am at the moment.\n4.2 This ‘balance’ that Lucinda strives for is one where she is no longer restricted by labels but can be\n‘whoever I am at the moment’. She explores the ambiguities of sexual identiﬁcations and yet notes she\nstill ‘struggles with this’. The ‘getting out’ of boxes that Lucinda seeks through spirituality is challenged by\nher sexuality, and there is clear tension in her account that places ‘balance in the rest of my life’ in conﬂict\nwith a sexuality that can’t be ‘in-between’. She attributes this to her ‘rigid upbringing’, but it is also clear\nthat the ‘rest of her life’ at Findhorn plays a part in constituting this tension. Thus there continues to be\ntensions between a sexual identiﬁcation and a holistic spirituality, even where participants tried to ‘make it\nnot an issue’.\n4.3 Where spiritual beliefs and feelings are recast as ‘natural’, similar to Christian assertions of being\n‘made by God’ (Wilcox 2003; Yip 1996; 1997), the marking of deviance by others in heteronormative\ndualistic ways (gay/straight, man/woman) can be contested. As Fiona says:\nI’m so ﬁrm within myself that what I live and what I feel is natural. I’m most excited about\nstuff that I’m learning through my partner actually. About gender, and non-duality in terms of\ngender because that was never really in my awareness, until I met her. And its bringing the\nwhole non-duality concept, which I was familiar with in the past, to gender and sexuality, and\nthen again it was another click, of course why has everything been segregated into man and\nwoman, and gay and straight and, we’ve just got two ends of a stick, and everyone has to be\neither this, or that. If there’s a lot of spirituality around, talking about bringing non-duality in,\nwhy is nobody talking about how that’s relevant in terms of sexuality? Cos it’s a very taboo\nthing to do, and it feels, it’s very conﬁrming to me. And, I’d just like to imagine what the\nworld would be like if people didn’t walk around fulﬁlling a man’s stereotype and a woman’s\nstereotype and, mixing things up and just being completely who they are. And if they’re\nattracted to someone who kind of has the same parts as they do then, who cares? It’s just\nall an expression of the same thing.\n4.4 Echoing arguments that question the binaries of man/woman, gay/straight (Browne 2004; Butler 1990;\nHalberstam 1998); resolving these binaries becomes a spiritual lesson by ‘imagining’ the world in non-\ndualist terms. Fiona, who is resident in the wider community, ﬂattens sexual and gender difference\ndeclaring her ideal as ‘all an expression of the same thing’. Yet she also alludes to the ‘taboo’ nature of\nsuch discussions of sexuality and gender that are not part of the broader spiritual lessons in this area.\n4.5 The rejection of labels and the search for individual pathways meant that questions regarding identities\nelicited insightful and detailed descriptions relating to sexuality. Allison’s response shows how she\nincorporates and rejects different representations of ‘her’ sexuality:\nHow would I present myself to the world? I wouldn’t say lesbian, that’s not right, I don’t\nidentify with the culture of lesbian. I wouldn’t say bisexual, cos that doesn’t incorporate all\ngenders. So I think it’s-, I don’t know. I can’t actually say it to people but like omnisexual, or\npansexual, just a space where it’s really connecting to another human being. So the way I\nreally describe it at this point is ‘hey, like I’ve just been in relationship with a woman for 3\nyears’, that’s my explanation.\n4.6 Allison, a resident in wider community, ‘queers’ sexual identity by rejecting normative labels, categories\nand boundaries, including those that delimit sexual identity and gendered attractions. She focuses on\nspaces of connection and her relationship allowing others to read her sexual identity from this without\nlocating herself alongside the ‘culture of lesbian’. Her connection to ‘another human being’ is not only\nsexual- it has spiritual connotations and implications. Whilst she sees her sexual/spiritual life as\ninseparable, she allows that others can use these categories to deﬁne her behaviour:\nActually, people are really good about it. They don’t go ‘so you’re lesbian’, or ‘so you’re this’,\nor ‘here’s the box now sit in it’. They actually say, ‘oh yeah, that’s interesting’, ‘wow, arelationship with a woman’. They use that wording, and it makes me feel exempt from having\nto tick all the boxes. I can just say, ‘this is actually where I ﬁt in, kind of’. Some people say\n‘gay’ and I’m like, ‘uh, if you really must, ﬁne, but I still look at guys’.\n4.7 Allison’s description not only questions boundaries and categories, it also puts sexuality in ﬂux. Those\nwho read her relationship and comment on the relationship rather than her sexuality are welcome, however\nthe imperative to deﬁne her (‘if you really must’) is tiresome and inaccurate for her.\n4.8 Rendering sexual identiﬁcations as associated with relationships and exploration can refuse the\npresumed ﬁxity of (sexual and spiritual) categories (Butler 1990; 1993; Corber and Valocchi 2003). Sasha,\na staff member, does not like sexual categories because they ﬁx what for her is constantly changing. She\ndoes not want to be limited by something to which she feels she has to conform:\nI think the term that I’m most comfortable with and that I use to people that know me, would\nbe just ﬂuid really. I don’t tend to name my sexual orientation or pin it down. But to people\nwho I don’t know or who I only have a quick moment to, you know, I could use lesbian. I\ndon’t feel entirely comfortable with that because it’s very limiting in a way.\nInterviewer: Why is it limiting?\nBecause it implies that it is something that I am and that I will be forever. It’s like a static\nthing. Its not, there’s no room for change or for life to happen. I’ve used bisexual as well but I\ndidn’t feel entirely comfortable with that either because the whole thing for me is complicated\nby my gender identity. So I don’t feel like any of those terms, lesbian or bisexual, really\ncovers, you know, what I feel my sexual orientation is. I could use pansexual maybe but\nmostly, yeah, just ﬂuid.\n4.9 In seeing her sexuality as ‘just ﬂuid’, Sasha resists imperatives associated with lesbian and bisexual\nwhich ‘pin it down’ and mean that ‘there’s no room for change or for life to happen’. Yet she also recognises\nthe importance of deploying identiﬁcations such as lesbian expediently to ‘people who I don’t know’.\nDrawing on the recognitions that are associated with this category, Sasha appeals to a collective\nunderstanding that can place her in ‘a quick moment’. Interestingly the negotiation of sexual categories is\ntied into spirituality where both are constantly evolving rather than being ﬁxed, located and stable:\nI think that in the early stages of me thinking about it [spirituality] and feeling into it, I kind of\nsensed that it was, because, it was transformative, in a way, for me. And the way that I saw\nmyself, saw the world, and the way I started thinking about it was also transferable to other\nthings and it was like awakening somehow to something. Yeah, a reality that I hadn’t seen\nbefore maybe, you know, but also the kind of realization that for me it’s a process not like\nthat’s the ultimate truth, its evolving somehow. That how I see, yeah, gender, sexuality,\neverything really, in a process, evolving.\n4.10 Sasha’s spirituality includes her belief that everything is ‘evolving’ and she applies this to ‘gender,\nsexuality’. This leads her to focus on the ‘process’ rather than ‘the ultimate truth’, echoing attempts to shift\nthe focus of sexuality from identities to practices, and making a distinction between the normative\nstructures privileging heterosexuality and individual patterns organizing sexual lives (Butler 1990; Corber\nand Valocchi 2003). The conscious consideration of such sexual-spiritual ﬂuidities is formed through\nunderstanding the need to work towards a higher consciousness through practices of the self.\nNevertheless participants also continually re-connect, and identify, with sexual (and spiritual) collectivities.\nMaking it ‘big’: Heteronormativity and identiﬁcation\n5.1 Many participants in this case study described ‘their’ sexuality in highly individualised ways. This\nresulted from, and also led to, a questioning of labels and ﬁxed categories around identity, including sexual\nidentity. So, it should not be surprising to ﬁnd that participants felt uncomfortable entering situations and\ninteractions in spaces that were clearly demarcated by sexuality, as Lucinda says:\nI actually ﬁnd it hard to go into gay meetings and stuff like that. It was like, we had a gay\nbrunch with the women who love women workshop, and I was asked to brunch for it, and its\nbasically a lesbian workshop, and I struggled with that, because of the label with it. Yeah, my\nsexuality is one part of me and I really don’t like going into spaces where it takes me out of\nthe other parts of me, that’s maybe a good way of describing it. I don’t know if I would ever\nstand up and say that I’m gay or that I’m a lesbian. I probably would, because again its\nexclusion, and I’m trying to include instead of exclude, yeah, I tend not to make it an issue.\n5.2 Lucinda’s invitation to a ‘gay brunch’ shows that she is read and understood in a particular way despite\nher discomfort in being visible by going to a gay meeting. There is a visibility in attending a brunch in a\ncommunity space which assumes a homogenous ‘us’ that is somehow different and thus separate from an\nexcluded ‘them’, which ‘takes me out of the other parts of me’. Lucinda’s refusal to ‘make it an issue’ can\nbe read as resistance to normative structures which prevent some sexual identities from going unmarked\nor seeming ‘right’ in the way heterosexuality can. However, not making ‘it’ an issue is also a refusal to\nengage in power struggles over who gets to deﬁne who, as we will discuss below.\n5.3 Intertwining sexualities and (‘New Age’) spiritualities can create space for alternative gender and sexual\nexpressions but it can also unintentionally allow for heterosexual assumptions when these expressions are\nnot speciﬁcally questioned or ‘queered’. Diana recalled an experience in which her ‘failure’ to ‘disclose’ may\nhave led to an assumption about her sexuality, which was then called into question by her presence on a\nworkshop for lesbian and bisexual women:I was doing woman to woman workshop, I’d met somebody at a party just beforehand, a\nman, and we’d had a really long conversation and he’d obviously assumed I was\nheterosexual because I’d mentioned my kids, and I’d never... it’s kind of like that thing, when\ndo you mention [it]? There was no reason in that conversation for me to mention my\nsexuality. And he was working at Cluny. I saw him. I said hello and he looked at me and\nwalked by so the next time I saw him I said to him ‘do you remember me? We had this long\nconversation at this party’, and he says ‘yes’, and I said well ‘why’, you know, ‘I just said\nhello you’re not saying hello back?’ And he just walked by again. And the only assumption\nthat I could make was that I was on this woman to woman and he now knew I was a lesbian\nand had made a sort of like, you know, that wasn’t who I thought I was talking to \n[later in the interview]\nIts like, people make assumptions. So you either go along with that assumption or you say\nsomething. And by saying something you’ve made it big and it shouldn’t be big. It should be\npart of everyone’s kind of, everyone’s on a continuum, as far as I’m concerned. Some people\nsee themselves as entirely heterosexual. Some people see themselves as entirely lesbian\nand blah, and all of that you know is absolutely ﬁne. But it’s all, it’s all just part of the ebb\nand ﬂow and it’s just great, but it’s like it becomes something big because of having to\nexplain or because of other peoples’-. If everybody kind of saw it as part of the ebb and the\nﬂow and it didn’t really matter and they didn’t make any assumptions then it wouldn’t kind of\nbe big.\n5.4 Diana is resident in wider community; she uses the term ‘big’ four times and this offers important\ninsights into how the ‘ebb and ﬂow’ and ‘continuum’ is disrupted by labelling that is at times both detested\nand necessary. Firstly she makes ‘it’ (her sexuality) ‘big’ by ‘saying something’; however her second use of\nthe term ‘big’ clariﬁes why this is an issue, particularly because the labelling of sexuality disrupts the\n(heterosexual) assumptions of others. As with Fiona above, the hidden power relations that recreate\nheterosexuality as normal are contested here. At one point Diana appears to see ‘making it big’ as in some\nway her fault. However, she then notes that these sexual assumptions should not have been there in the\nﬁrst place. Thus, ‘revealing’ alternative sexualities can create the ‘non-normative’ as something that\nquestions, perhaps queers, spiritual continuity and ebbs and ﬂows. Moreover, Diana’s linking of the\nspiritual and the sexual is not always apparent, leading to tension in encounters where sexuality continues\nto matter to those who seek to deﬁne the interaction normatively.\n5.5 Sexuality also came to matter to participants when moves between individual and shared (spiritual)\nexperiences were undertaken. Sasha explains that although categories limited ‘my freedom to be myself’\nsharing ‘community’ spaces was inspiring.\nSo it was inspiring for me to be there [in a gay and lesbian workshop]. It was also inspiring to\nshare, for myself, and to talk about our community and to see how that landed with the\npeople in the room. So inspiring I think but also something uncomfortable around being there\npurely because of, I think it’s the ‘who identiﬁes who?’ or ‘do I get to identify myself?’ or ‘do\nthey identify me as?’. So I wouldn’t have been asked unless I’d been identiﬁed as something\nso, already it’s a little for me like, does this limit my freedom to be myself or can I go in and\nbe completely open? So dealing with that edge a bit and maybe it’s just an internal one, and\nmaybe it’s actually, you know, that maybe there would have been some reactions if I went\ninto certain topics.\n5.6 Sasha’s narrative points to the tensions of ‘who identiﬁes who’ and how one gets into a room to ‘talk\nabout community’ without such naming. The perception that she has already been ‘identiﬁed as something’\ncreates an ‘edge’ between spiritual/sexual, individual/collective identiﬁcation. Whilst neither spiritual/sexual\nis deﬁned or deﬁnable, there is still a recognition that there may be some ‘reactions’ that differentiate\nbetween those who are supposedly ‘the same’.\n5.7 The questioning and rejection of labels was not ubiquitous across the sample, indeed labels could be\nused when they were an expression of the inner, spiritual self. Males interviewed for this research were\ngenerally happy to identify as gay men. At the end of the gay and lesbian experience week there was a\n‘gay-lidh’ rather than a ceilidh. This was not without tension; some visitors said they would rather have a\nsimple quiet evening but the organisers felt it was important to mark this experience week as different to a\n‘normal’ (i.e. not gay) workshop. Experience weeks for different nationalities (Italian, German, Japanese)\nand ages (family, gentle) do not mark the end of their workshops in this way. George, a staff member, felt it\nwas important to be visible and noted the reluctance to being called lesbian more than gay:\nI feel that is very very important [to be visible] and I have been a bit puzzled about this. Ok\nso the new generation seem to not identify with whatever and certainly don’t like being called\nlesbian. It’s mainly lesbian more than gay really, which is a complete surprise to me. But\nthen I think well maybe it’s partly because they haven’t really had the struggle that it has\nbeen difﬁcult\n5.8 Here sexuality matters through the call for labelling and a struggle for visibility in gender differentiated\nways. What perplexes George is exactly what has been explored in the previous sections, namely by not\naligning themselves with public displays and utterances of acceptable LGB categories LGB spiritual\nseekers can create personalised non-heterosexual sexualities, but even in these personalisations there are\nmoments, however reluctant and contingent, of association with particular labels. Arguably this reﬂects a\nparadoxical position that is at once homo and hetero -normative. It reﬂects both privilege in being in a\ncommunity where lesbian, gay and bisexual lives are supposedly acceptable and being ‘out’ to others is\nnot always necessary, and a recognition that unless alternative sexual identities are known, performed or\ndisclosed then heterosexuality is assumed. The irony of putting the self ﬁrst is that it reveals how\nheteronormativity continues to operate as an unmarked status of self-identity. George, however, does notrelate naming to segregation of the self and a lack of attention to the ‘whole’. Such complexities point to\ndiverse negotiations of spiritual/sexual selves that defy easy or linear accounts and cannot be bounded\nwithin the spiritual OR the sexual.\nConclusion\nHolly: It’s much more than only sexually, ﬁrst that is already actually a very narrow question.\nThis is comment on the whole research cos if I only have to answer on that it means that I’m\nonly talking about my sexual or gender identity and for me being a lesbian has inﬂuenced\nevery aspect of my life, so it is much wider than only sexual oriented. \nThe last years it’s deﬁnitely [been] very clear that I needed even to identify myself again as\na lesbian, to make it visible because it’s very easy in this still heterosexual world to become\ninvisible, especially if you don’t have a relationship and people don’t see with who you are, it\nis automatically believed that you are heterosexual, and I thought for that reason I have to,\neven in a community on a spiritual base I have to come out as a lesbian again\n6.1 The historic academic separation of, and presumed antipathy between, religion and particular sexual\nlives is further explored through a contemporary site of New Age spirituality. Although spiritual seekers\nwould like spiritual notions of holism to intertwine sexuality and spirituality in presumably liberal and\nindividualised ways, our data paint a more complex picture. By focusing on interactions and practices we\nalso avoid the relatively non-social conceptualisation of New Age that relates this solely to religious\npractices and beliefs. By focusing on social interactions, identities and experiences, we found, perhaps\nunsurprisingly, the participants in this study did not identify with the labels which we, as researchers, were\ntrying to explore. Neither did they like going into places and situations that were speciﬁcally marked and\ndeﬁned by sexuality. Instead, participants drew on individualised and innovative resources to deﬁne their\nsexual identity and to resist labelling and social roles that more traditional sexual identities carry with them.\n6.2 Holly’s realization that ‘I have to come out as a lesbian again’ reinstates the intention to be visible as a\nsexual subject, demonstrating the ﬂuidities and tensions that are the crux of this paper. The imperative to\nbe visible as LGB has not yet fully abated, even in supposedly liberal situations where ‘anything goes’\nquestioning some assertions of queer post-identity politics. Spiritual spaces may not be as open and\nharmonious as either expected or desired and sexual difference is still marked and noted even where it is\nthen ‘ignored’. Consequently, and perhaps contradictorily, the spiritual aspiration to act ‘from within’ can\nmean distancing oneself from social roles and public cultures of sexuality, whilst also recognising that\nthese are at times necessary in creating and negotiating a sense of self and resisting heteronormative\nassumptions. The experiences of LGB people at Findhorn which we represent here show that self-\nreﬂexivity has to be negotiated within certain heteronormative frameworks which deﬁne non-normative\nsexual lives, identities and experiences. There are clear tensions here in the ways collective and individual\npractices, and collective identiﬁcations are negotiated: a wholly privatised non-normative sexuality can\nlead to assumptions of heterosexuality where identiﬁcation is not made explicitly clear, yet constraints\n‘limit my freedom to be myself’ when and where one is identiﬁed as ‘something’.\n6.3 Holly, similar to other participants, in aligning herself with a particular sexual identity and culture, also\nundermines the imperative to individualism which often neglects the situational contexts which inform life\nbiographies (Walliss 2002). Indeed the very fact that people go to Findhorn demonstrates that they are\nlooking for relational experiences of spirituality, not just individual ones. Problematizing non-hegemonic\nsexual expression reminds us that sexual desire and behaviour are always situated within social conditions\nthat shape its expression (O’Brien 2008). The spaces and interactions highlighted here point to contexts\nwhere the pervasive effects of heteronormativity are reinscribed, even as they are challenged by ideas\nabout identity and social roles. Therefore, although participants can be read as seeking to live the ﬂuid\nidentities that queer theory proposes (and that were connected to certain spiritual belief systems), the\nresearch demonstrates that not only is this a privileged position to occupy but is also ultimately\nunsustainable in that a ﬂuid identity becomes re-subsumed in heteronormativity. Eventually, as Holly’s\nexperience demonstrates, individuals often have to ‘come out’ and identify over and over again. This\ncritique ties in with the desire for community identity (both spiritual and non-heterosexual) in order to\nfacilitate change and growth (see also Kirsch, 2000). We thus ﬁnish by contending that whilst research\nneeds to continue to explore that which questions LGB (and urgently T) identiﬁcations and collectivities,\nand spiritual integration and autonomy, we must also be aware of the endurance of heteronormativity,\nparticularly where ‘acceptance’ is presumed. The requirement for sexual identiﬁcations (as well as\ncommunity and belonging) outside of presumed heterosexuality has yet to dissipate.\nNotes\n1 The more common acronym LGBT includes lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people however this study\nonly includes LGB people. Therefore, this paper only discusses sexuality rather than sexual/gender\nidentities. Rather than seeing these as distinct or necessarily having separate spiritual experiences, this\ngap will be discussed later as partly constructed through research recruitment (such that trans people\nrefused to be involved in the research and therefore should not be tokenistically represented here) and as a\nfunction of forms of power that operates between LGBT people. This points to a signiﬁcant area of\nresearch that needs further augmentation.\n2 By heteronormativity we mean a set of gendered and sexualised norms that create particular versions of\nnormative heterosexuality and gender identiﬁcations. This set of norms works to invisiblise the continual\nimperative to reproduce speciﬁc forms of heterosexuality and normative male/female identities. As a result\nthe dominance of heterosexuality often operates in unnamed ways that make it difﬁcult to expose or\ndislodge (see Butler 1993: Browne 2004).3 One exception to this is the literature, although not large, on the Wicca community.\n4 Coincidentally one group was all female and the other all male.\n5 Participants were aged between 20 and 60, 9 were female and six male; from seven different countries;\nwere white and ‘middle class’. Three were staff members of the Findhorn Foundation, 7 were community\nmembers and 5 were visitors at the time of the research. further details of the data collection and how\nsample characteristics were obtained are available in Browne et al. 2009.\n6 For further data on the tensions between sexuality and religious individualism within the setting of the\nFindhorn spiritual community, see Browne and Dinnie 2010.\nReferences\nAUPERS, S and Houtman, D (2006) ‘Beyond the Spiritual Supermarket’, Journal of Contemporary Religion,\nvol. 21, no. 2, pp.201-222.\nBROWN, G (2008) ‘Thinking beyond homonormativity: performative explorations of diverse gay\neconomies’, Environment and Planning A, vol. 41, no. 6, pp.1496-1510 [doi:10.1068/a4162]\nBROWNE, K (2004) Genderism and the bathroom problem: (Re)materialising sexed sites, (re)creating\nsexed bodies.

    "abstract": "Intersections between religion and sexuality are coming onto social science agendas. However, this has predominantly been in terms of its treatment by mainstream religions, particularly Christianity and Islam, and thus in contexts traditionally hostile to lesbian, gay and bi sexualities (LGB). This article extends this by exploring identities and contestations of sexuality within activities that have variously been described as \\'New Age\\' or \\'spiritual\\'. Considering the experiences and interactions of spiritual seekers avoids a non-social conceptualisation of \\'New Age\\' which views spirituality primarily as an individualistic experience. The specific focus here is the Findhorn Community, a spiritual community and demonstration eco-village in Scotland. We find that seekers\\' attempt to resist labelling and categorisation through creating and using individualised sexual (as well as spiritual) expressions. However, tensions stemming from (heteronormative) interactions within the Findhorn community show that sexual diversity and labelling continues to matter. The research demonstrates that sexual fluidity is a privileged position to occupy, but that it is also ultimately unsustainable in that fluid identity becomes re-subsumed in heteronormativity and, eventually, individuals have to come out and identify all over again. The continuing imperative for some LGB people to define themselves as/with \\'something\\', is thus apparent even within supposedly individualized settings and belief systems. Such positioning questions the individuality that is presumed to define New Age spiritualities, and shows how categories of lesbian, gay and bisexual also continue to be deployed at the same time as they are resisted and reinterpreted.Individuality; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual; Sexuality; Spirituality; Findhorn Community",
