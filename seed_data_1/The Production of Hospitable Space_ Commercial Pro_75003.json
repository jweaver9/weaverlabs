Drawing on a study of a venue patronized by lesbian, gay, bisexual andtranssexual/transgender consumers, it considers how social and commercial forms of hospitalityare mobilized. The paper argues that hospitable space has an ideological, normative andsituational dimension. More specifically, it suggests the bar’s operation is tied to a set ofideological conceptions, which become the potential basis of association and disassociationamong consumers. It examines the forces and processes that shape who participates in theproduction and consumption of hospitality and how. Finally, it considers the situational, emergentnature of hospitality and the discontinuous production of hospitable space. Rather than focusingexclusively on host-guest or provider-customer relations, which dominates existing work onhospitality, the paper examines how consumers’ perceptions, actions and interactions shape theproduction of hospitality. By doing so the paper offers an alternative approach to understandingqueer spaces, bar operation as well as hospitality.Keywords: Hospitality, Space, Bars, Lesbian, Gay, Queer,INTRODUCTIONIn recent years there has been renewed interest among different academic communities inhospitality. Philosophers (Derrida, 2000, 2001; Friese, 2004), sociologists and cultural theorists(Germann-Molz & Gibson, 2007) and geographers (Barnett, 2005; Dikeç, 2002) have usedhospitality to understand the politics of community and inclusion, particularly in discussions ofglobal migration. Geographers such as Bell (2007a) have also begun to examine the relationshipbetween hospitality, urban cultures and the transformation of urban space. At the same time,management researchers who traditionally treated hospitality as a series of economic andorganizational practices have embraced social scientific conceptions of hospitality in their studiesof its commercial provision (Lashley et al, 2007). There is increasing cross fertilization of ideasbetween different disciplines and scholars have examined how hospitality, as a particular type ofsocial practice or discourse, may be entangled in the management of commercial operations (DiDomenico & Lynch, 2007; Lugosi, 2008). This paper builds on and advances this body of workby examining the intersection of social and commercial forms of hospitality and queer cultures. Itcontributes to our understanding of queer cultures and space by identifying the processes throughwhich commercial venues become particular spaces of leisure consumption for those who seek toreject or resist hetero-normative conventions. Moreover, it contributes to our understanding ofhow social and commercial forms of hospitality interact by examining how commercial offeringsor propositions become subjective consumer experiences of hospitality. The paper shifts theemphasis from examining host-guest transactions, which dominates existing conceptions ofhospitality (Lashley et al, 2007), to simultaneously considering guest experiences and guest-guesttransactions. More specifically, it examines the implications that consumer perceptions andpractices have on the production of commercial hospitality and on the transformation of acommercial venue into a hospitable space. This broader approach thus provides the theoretical andempirical basis for understanding how other spaces are rendered hospitable or inhospitable.This paper draws on an ethnographic study of the “Freelands” – a bar located in thesuburban town of Compton in the south of England.1 The bar had a large gay and lesbian clientbase, but the operators did not target these consumer segments exclusively, and heterosexual menand women from the local neighbourhood also patronized the bar. The company operating the baremployed two managers, but provided minimal investment in furnishing, decoration,entertainment or advertisement. A small allowance was provided for the cleaners, but no extrafunds were provided for bar staff. Any additional staff were paid from the cleaning allowance, themanagers’ wages or from not putting soft drink sales through the till. This low level of generalinvestment was important in determining the bar’s management and the consumers’ consumptionpractices. The lack of economic capital needed to maintain this venture was substituted by themobilization of social capital, and the operators relied on personal transactions of hospitality withcustomers to sustain the operation.I began visiting the Freelands on a social basis, but I rapidly developed a sociologicalcuriosity about the social and organizational dynamics of the bar. I eventually started workingthere as a barman and continued working for 27 months. In addition, I made social visits to thisand other bars, clubs and cafes over a five-year period (see Lugosi, 2003, 2006, 2007a, 2008).Short notes were made during visits, sometimes discretely in quiet corners or toilets, butsometimes openly among patrons. These notes were elaborated on, usually on the same day ornight of the visit. The insights gained through observations and informal conversations werecomplemented by semi-structured interviews with 26 informants from the Freelands (9 female and17 male), 19 of whom were interviewed repeatedly. Interviews were generally conducted on a one-on-one basis, but 24 of the informants were also interviewed in groups of two and three. Initialinterviews were mostly conducted in the bar and subsequent ones in other bars, restaurants andinformants’ homes. The formal and informal interviews with consumers, staff and managersprovided opportunities to explore their experiences of this and other spaces, while also helping toidentify operational issues.This paper considers the relationship between discourses of community, inclusion andsafety and the operation of the venue. It adopts a processual approach, which stresses theinteraction of the abstract, material and symbolic in the production of space (Cuthill, 2007;Lugosi, 2007b). More specifically, it examines the processes that produce notions of hospitablespace and it demonstrates the tensions and contradictions in these processes. It is argued thathospitable space has an ideological, normative and situational dimension. The paper suggests thatthe bar’s operation is tied to a set of ideological conceptions, the myths of commonality, safetyand play, which become the potential basis of association and disassociation among consumers.The discussion demonstrates how the bar’s operators attempted to mobilise these myths in theconstruction of the hospitality proposition, and how this was received by patrons. The paper alsoexamines the norms and normative processes that shaped the production and consumption ofhospitality. This illustrates how consumers experienced and co-created notions of hospitablespace. Finally, the paper considers the situational nature of hospitality and the discontinuousproduction of hospitable space. It demonstrates how notions of hospitableness emerged anddisappeared in different moments. It is important to note that three dimensions are not mutuallyexclusive: they often overlap and the actions of operators and consumer may simultaneouslyreflect the different dimensions. Nevertheless, attempting to distinguish between the threedimensions helps to illustrate how hospitality emerges in particular situations and how or why itmay be reproduced over time.HOSPITALITYBrotherton’s (1999, p.168) frequently cited definition states that hospitality is “acontemporaneous human exchange, which is voluntarily entered into, and designed to enhance themutual well being of the parties concerned through the provision of accommodation, and/or food,and/or drink.” This view of hospitality has been supplanted by arguments that it also involvescomplex relationships between providers, receivers and the locations in which they areexperienced (Lashley et al, 2007; Di Domenico & Lynch, 2007; Lugosi, 2003, 2008). Beyondfood, drink and accommodation, hospitality transactions involve the interpretation, articulationand negotiation of identities, power relationships, property relations and space. These alternativeperspectives have destabilised narrow definitions of hospitality; emerging work has offered newopportunities to examine hospitality in a variety of contexts and to apply the concept to otherintellectual fields; however, the literature also reveals the disparate nature of work on the subject.Historically, hospitality management academics have been concerned with the provision offood, drink and shelter within a commercial transaction (Lashley et al, 2007). Such mundaneforms of hospitality are sometimes offered through extensive provider-consumer interaction(Crang, 1994), but in commercial environments food and drink can also be provided with minimalor no interaction between staff and customers or between customers. Therefore, commercialprovision may not involve actual hospitableness.Management academia offers a utilitarian conception of hospitality, and this approach isincreasingly being criticized for its failure to account for the social, cultural, political or emotionaldimensions of such transactions (Lashley et al, 2007; Lugosi, 2008). Nevertheless, managerialconcerns about the organization of the service environment and the mobilization of humanresources are fundamental to understanding those commercial operations where food, drink orshelter is provided through provider-customer interaction. The challenge is to examine the socialand cultural forces that shape how operational factors are created, maintained and transformed. Itis therefore necessary to look beyond hospitality management, to social science, for a broaderconception of its provision.Anthropological studies offer an alternative perspective on hospitality and hospitablebehaviour (cf, Douglas, 1987). Selwyn (2000, p. 19), for example, argues that hospitality is aparticular type of social practice in which “exchanges of goods and services, both material andsymbolic” are used to establish new relationships or build existing ones. The provision of aphysical space and sensory stimulus, the transactions of food and drink and performances of selfhave social functions in mediating relationships, reaffirming social structures while helping toconstruct host and guests’ identities (Selwyn, 2000).  This broader conception of hospitality helpsto appreciate that offers of food, drink and shelter may be augmented by entertaining socialintercourse and the provision of other forms of entertainment, for example music. It shifts thefocus of inquiry beyond its mundane forms that are transacted in commercial venues for money.However, Selwyn (2000) is keen to maintain an analytical distinction between social forms ofhospitality and that provided in commercial settings rather than using the former to understand thelatter.Selwyn’s distinction between social and commercial hospitality is reflected in the existenceof relatively few studies that examine in detail how these different forms interact (see Lashley etal (2007) and Germann-Molz and Gibson (2007) for discussions of work that addresses thisimbalance). Numerous sociological, anthropological and geographical studies examine hospitalityprovision in commercial settings (Crang, 1994; Erickson, 2004). However, these have focused onservice work i.e. on one type of hospitality rather than hospitality per se. Moreover, the provisionof hospitality services is frequently conceptualized in terms of the gendered nature of servicework, emotional labour or in terms of a general critique of organizational regimes. Olesen (1994)examines the notion of hospitality as social transaction when discussing its commercial form,although her work is also concerned with the identity performances of frontline workers. Moreimportant, her reference to commercial hospitality as “pseudo-hospitality” continues to separateits social forms from its provision in commercial settings. Such studies of hospitality are thusconcerned with the service providers or provision, and with few exceptions (see e.g. Cuthill, 2007;Laurier et al, 2001; Lynch, 2005), other aspects of the experience, including the consumers’perspectives and the contexts of transactions are rarely considered. The latter issues have usuallybeen examined in sociological studies (e.g. Cavan, 1966) that neglect to examine in any real detailthe managerial aspects of commercial venues.Philosophical studies conceptualize hospitality as ethical practice involving welcoming,inclusion, sheltering and reciprocity, which is entangled in the social politics of communities andnation states. Hospitality at this conceptual level may involve, but is not limited to, mundanetransactions of food or drink (Derrida, 2000, 2001; Friese, 2004; Germann-Molz & Gibson, 2007).Dikeç (2002, p. 236) posits that hospitality is a gesture of engagement. In its ideal form,hospitality is a proposition of closer physical or social proximity and can therefore be thought ofas an attempt to overcome or at least temper the effects of difference. Derrida (2000) maintainsthat such ideal, pure forms of hospitality are unachievable; consequently, we can never know whathospitality is and all we have are unfulfilled possibilities of hospitality. Participation or inclusionin hospitality is always conditional: within hospitality transactions hosts have duties to ensure thewellbeing of their guests, while guests have obligations to respect the rules of the host and toreciprocate; both are subjugated to the hospitality transaction and to the creation of a hospitablespace. The offering and acceptance of hospitality specifies a threshold which is then crossed, andin doing so it reinforces roles, identities and distinctions between host and guest. However,Sherringham and Daruwalla (2007) suggest that hospitality may also be considered a transgressiveform of engagement where existing norms and statuses are temporarily abandoned. As I notedpreviously, those involved in transactions negotiate their roles alongside their dominance orsubservience.Such conceptions of hospitality have often been applied, in abstract terms, to issues ofimmigration and nation states rather than concrete practices in commercial environments (Derrida,2000; Dikeç, 2002; Friese, 2004). Nevertheless, a philosophical conception of hospitality is usefulin focusing attention on who may receive or participate in hospitality, the ethics and rules thatgovern the relationship between host and guest and the limits of hospitality. The challenge is toexamine how these issues emerge through and are shaped by concrete practices of hospitalitywithin its commercial provision and consumption.The literature highlights that hospitality is a multi-layered phenomena. It also demonstratesthat managerial, social scientific and philosophical approaches offer a partial but importantunderstanding of its different forms and dimensions. To understand how its social and commercialmanifestations become entangled, it is therefore necessary to consider critically the interactionbetween the different approaches to hospitality: the managerial or operational focus on how foodand drink provision emerges as a set of propositions for consumers, the anthropological focus onthe social and cultural functions of hospitality transactions and the philosophical concerns aboutthe ethical or political principles that underpin and shape these transactions.Despite the different focus of the three intellectual approaches, there is a common theme intheir conceptions: the focus on host-guest or provider-customer transactions at the expense ofguests’ experience of hospitable spaces as well as guest-guest or customer-customer transactions.Writers have acknowledged the problematic nature of the notions of host and guest (Bell, 2007b;Lashley et al, 2007): roles may be reversed or blurred, and “hosting” and “guesting” may emergethrough a variety of material, technological, discursive and performative processes. Within thispaper I intend to move beyond simplistic notions of host and guest and consider how hospitablespace is produced through a range of social and spatial processes. Some of these processes aredriven by what may traditionally be conceived as hosting by “hosts” or providers of hospitality,but also implicated are a range of other forces, relationships and interactions – many of whichhave to be understood by considering the consumers or “guests” and their experiences ofhospitable space. Within commercial contexts, interaction between hosts and guests or staff andcustomers may only form one part of the consumption experience. Cuthill’s (2007) study ofcontemporary bars suggests that the “style crowd,” a group of loosely affiliated individuals whoshare similar lifestyle and demographic profiles, helps to recreate the stylish image of venuesthrough embodied performances of self. Lugosi (2007a; 2008) goes further and distinguishesconsumers’ participation in operational aspects from the performances of self that contribute tothe image and ambience of the venue. These studies illustrate how consumers interact in multipleways and play an active part in the creation of the service culture and the experience ofhospitality. There is a need, however, to examine further how customers’ relationships with thehospitality offering i.e., the combination of such factors as the service environment, the musicpolicy, staff and the operational practices shape their experiences of hospitable space.HOSPITALITY AND QUEER SPACEThere is a strong historical relationship between lesbian, gay, bisexual andtranssexual/transgender (LGBT) consumers and hospitality venues (David, 1997). Bars,restaurants, cafés and clubs offer opportunities for the expression of shared interest and sharedidentity (Wolfe, 1992), but they are also places of shelter, where patrons are shielded fromsurveillance and homophobic violence (Weightman, 1980). Lugosi (2007b) argues that for queerconsumers, consumption within venues is tied to the pervading notions that a) patrons in such ahospitable space are, to some extent at least, a collective entity whose members have a sharedinterest in maintaining their social space by b) protecting those who invest capital of various sorts(social, economic, aesthetic etc.) in reproducing the values associated with that space, and c)allowing patrons to engage in activities that are subject to sanction outside that space. Lugosi(2007b) refers to these as the myths of commonality, safety and liberated play. To call them mythsis not to imply that they are falsehoods or illusory sets of beliefs. Rather, they are tentativeideological conceptions – “a set of interconnected beliefs and their associated attitudes, shared andused by members of a group” (Fine & Sandstrom, 1993, p. 24). The production of such ideologiesinvolves evaluative activities concerning what ought to be and they also have a behaviouralcomponent, insofar as they inform attitudes and actions (ibid). Lugosi (2007b) maintains that suchmyths are subject to contestation and only survive in so far as they are constantly perpetuated andconsistently reproduced. As Moore (1975) suggests, ideologies are adjusted and regulatedsituationally among particular agencies and there is the potential for idiosyncrasy andindeterminacy in their reproduction. Research demonstrates that commercial hospitality venuesare not equally hospitable to everyone; the myths of commonality, safety and play are reproduced,undermined and contested at various times (cf, Johnson & Samdahl, 2005; Skeggs, 1999).Previous studies, therefore, point to the need to examine the forces that regulate and disrupt thehospitableness of venues.Sociological concerns about identity performance and inclusion/exclusion articulatedthrough patronage unintentionally engage with specific dimensions of hospitality. Brown (2000)and Weightman’s (1980) references to the absence of windows and unobtrusive frontage, or morerecent observations about large windows in contemporary gay and lesbian venues that emphasizevisibility point to the management of the servicescape in commercial hospitality (Binnie &Skeggs, 2004; Skeggs, 1999). Discussions of exclusionary tactics, including door policies(Beemyn, 1997; Reitzes & Diver, 1982) are effectively references to management practices.Furthermore, Kennedy and Davis’ (1993) accounts of lesbians’ experiences of being welcomedand made to feel safe in these venues are, fundamentally, gestures of hospitality by operators andpatrons. However, these studies do not consider hospitality per se; nor do they attempt to examinethe different dimensions of hospitality that were outlined in the previous section.Kuntsman (2007) has at least partly challenged this trend. Her study of online discussionsabout an Israeli club catering for Russian speaking LGBT immigrants offers a number ofinteresting insights into immigrant queer spaces and hospitality.  Commentary on the venue, theservice and its patrons reveals the ongoing tension between inclusion and exclusion. This emergesfrom conflicts between notions of queer community, the discourses of hospitality entangled in thisvenue and Russian/Soviet heritage. Kunstman’s work reveals the tenuous nature of hospitality; itpoints to the ambivalent relationship that people share with venues attempting to perpetuatenotions of queer community; and patrons’ comments reveal how particular aspects of thecommercial provision, such as the staffs’ Russian appearance, poor quality service, drinks andfacilities, become objects that mediate people’s sense of exclusion. However, Kunstman does notset out to examine the management of the commercial venue and her analysis focuses on migrantrather than queer identities. Consequently there remains a need to consider how notions ofhospitality may be entangled with discourses of queer community, identity and consumption. Thispaper examines how the social, political, ethical and commercial dimensions of hospitality mayemerge in and interact with the operation of a queer space and consumer’s experience ofpatronage. Focusing on hospitality reveals how venues may become inclusive, safe and ludicspaces for some consumer and why they are not for others.DIMENSIONS OF HOSPITABLE SPACEIDEOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS OF HOSPITABLE SPACEWithin the Freelands the management and staff employed a series of environmental cues toperpetuate ideological conceptions about the venue. One of the first set of managers hung arainbow flag – an overt display of queer visibility and community – outside the bar tocommunicate that it was a hospitable space for queer consumers, but it was moved inside the barfollowing complaints from neighbours. Subsequent managers employed a range of operationalstrategies to reinforce the notions that this was a safe space where consumers were shielded fromsurveillance, and also a space in which liberated play was possible. They installed frostedwindows and blinds, which staff were instructed to lower every evening after six o’clock. Staffalso had to turn on a vast array of flashing disco lights and the music policy was limited to threemain varieties: contemporary popular music (mostly vocal dance music), popular “street soul” ormodern Rhythm and Blues, or harder club-oriented tracks (some, purely instrumental, but mostwith some synthesized vocals). The music had to be played loudly to highlight the energetic andplayful nature of the bar and of the consumers’ experience.Beyond the purposeful distinction between outside and inside and the manipulation of theservice environment, the managers accentuated the hospitableness of the venue by drawing on aseries of social and political issues that were considered important for queer consumers. Forexample, a World Aids Day event was held each year, which was accompanied by promotionaldrinks, charity collections and raffles. The managers also supported members of a local gay andlesbian charity by hosting “packing parties” every month during which customers helped make uppacks containing condoms and lubricants in return for drink tokens. Though this did not guaranteesocial cohesion among consumers, by organizing such theme nights managers attempted totransform patronage into overt expressions of commonality and mutual interest.Delineating the bar as a hospitable space also involved the reproduction of the idea that theFreelands facilitated hedonistic forms of consumption and that it was a space in which thehomophobia of the surrounding area could be challenged. The managers again used a series ofovert environmental cues to direct the patrons’ perceptions of the moral codes of space. Forexample, one of the male managers hung on each wall black and white pictures of naked malebodies. One picture was of a male hand holding his crotch and captioned: “safer sex.” The samemanager also redesigned an American pedestrian sign so instead of flashing “walk”/“don’t walk”it read “wank”/“don’t wank.” These acts of display used the sexualized or aesthetically objectifiedbody to create an image of a location where overt displays of sexual reference were encouragedand celebrated. However, they also reflect the male-centric nature of the hospitality propositionand the potential marginalization of females within discourses of hospitable space (cf, Johnson &Samdahl, 2005).The operators assembled a broad set of signifiers to orchestrate the social order of thebar and to purposefully emphasize the difference between the inhospitableness of outside with thehospitableness of inside. These can be read as attempts to produce propositions of hospitality. Thecelebratory events, the rainbow flag, the blinds and frosted windows and the use of suggestivepictures and particular genres of music were used to reassert the myths of commonality, safetyand play and render the venue a particular type of hospitable space. However, juxtaposing thesesignifiers attempted to blur the distinction between heterogonous groups of consumers, and forsome, this bricolage was a problematic construction of queerness. For example, frustrationssurrounding the flag emerged in an interview with two men in their early 20s:Dean: One thing I can’t stand about this place is the flag thing going on. […] It bothers me![…] Pride [the name of the rainbow flag] was originally like we are proud andcelebrating…Homosexuality (someone whispers).Dean: The imagery, ‘pride’, was originally the imagery of the flag; they need to change itbecause Pride doesn’t mean the same thing it used to mean. It is an older thing now.Nathan: Change with the time; we are the new generation! […] There was the old schoolgay. We are the new school. The old school were very leather queeny, very fancy youngqueens walking around wearing strap-ons with leather and stuff. Back dark rooms, placeslike Fist and stuff.Comments about the flag pointed to intergenerational fissures, and to the cosmopolitan discoursesof contemporary queer consumption (see Binnie & Skeggs, 2004), which were absent at theFreelands. For some consumers, the proposition was exclusionary rather than inclusive and ithighlighted both the fragility of notions of community and the inhospitable nature of venues usingsuch operational strategies in targeting queer consumers.Danni, a gay man in his early 20s, made clear his sense of exclusion when he said he hated“shit gay music.” Danni was a dedicated follower of alternative rock bands such as Rage Againstthe Machine and was frustrated by the lack of gay venues catering for his tastes. He said if hewanted to go to gay places, he had to endure the same types of popular dance music played at theFreelands. For Danni, this was more than music; this was about the sort of sub-cultural assertionsand assumptions associated with specific types of music. When recounting a visit to a popular gaybar in London he said “I walked in with long hair, jeans and a leather jacket and they told me thatI was in the wrong pub. They asked if I was looking for the [rockers’] pub next door.” He clearlyfelt his style, and the cultural genres he identified with, clashed with those perpetuated by themajority of popular gay venues. For Danni, music was an aural manifestation of these conflictingstyles. It reflected the type of clientele whose patronage was encouraged and for whom the venuewas hospitable, and those it excluded. Such animosity was also revealed during interviews withlesbian consumers:Peter: What about music, what sort of music do they play in there?Nicola: Cheesy pop.Karen: They play the same music in every single pub I go to.Peter: In every straight pub or gay pub?Karen: Oh no not a straight pub. In a [straight] pub you’ll listen to Oasis, Texas, a widerange…Nicola: Good music.Karen: You go into the Freelands, Whytes, Coast [other gay venues], it’s all “dud dud,” Ican’t stand it. It’s like, why can’t they make one night of old music.Nicola: Proper music, with actual instruments and singers.Karen: It is not gay enough [for other people]. We are being stereotyped by the music.Nicola: It’s like 11 year old music and gay music go hand in hand.Management’s construction of the proposition therefore revealed the inherent contradictionsin attempting to reproduce the ideologies of hospitable space. Music in particular was a signifierof queer identity used to emphasize the playful aspects of the bar. But this and other attempts bythe operators to conflate the myths of commonality and playful consumption were perceived bysome consumers as the perpetuation of a narrow definition of queer community.NORMATIVE DIMENSIONS OF HOSPITABLE SPACEA second key dimension of hospitable space involves the normative processes and normsthat help to create and sustain it. I use the notion of normative to stress the importance ofcentripetal forces that perpetuate particular roles, expectations and patterns of behaviour frompatrons. Following Derrida (2000) and Lashley et al’s (2007) arguments, discourses of hospitalitycan only experienced as a series of conditional offerings, rules, roles and obligations. Theoccupation of any commercial venue will have a normative dimension as customers conform toparticular expectations of patronage. In the Freelands these normative forces were entangled withthe myths of commonality, safety and play. These roles or patterns should not be thought of asbeing totally fixed or consistently reproduced in exactly the same way. As I argue later, patronagecan also be disruptive or creative in generating alternative notions of hospitality and space.Nevertheless, their repeated emergence reinforces particular discourses about the hospitablenessof space, both in the material or performed expressions themselves, and also as they reproducecultural patterns and values for others.Patronage, and by extension the commercially viability of the bar, was shaped byconsumers’ ability and willingness to mobilise economic and social capital. Patronage alsoinvolved particular identity performances, interaction rituals and mundane hospitalitytransactions, which reproduced group norms, inside-outside statuses alongside experiences ofsocial proximity and distance (see Cavan, 1966; Cuthill, 2007; Lugosi, 2003 for furtherexamples). Within the Freelands, as in other venues targeting LGBT consumers (Beemyn, 1997),performances of queer selves, which included but were not limited to public displays of affectionand camp, were important in defining it as hospitable (see Lugosi, 2003, 2007a).  However, theFreelands also highlighted how focusing on hospitality transactions, in its broadest sense, canprovide insights into how the commercial venue may be transformed into a hospitable space.More specifically, the ongoing mobilization of economic capital and social capital was frequentlydiscussed during interviews alongside expressions of duty:Basically we say we better go up the gay bar because we should be seen to besupporting it. Because if everyone just shut off it just wouldn’t go on. It is nice tohave it about, so you have the option that if you’ve had a bad day you can sit thereas a couple and have a drink.(Elaine)I respect the fact that [the managers] opened the bar and kept it going for this long. It isimportant to come to show support.(James)Some consumers even acknowledged that their obligation to a hospitable queer space outweighedtheir disdain towards the actual experience of patronage:I would still go there but I don’t enjoy it. I know it sounds like I am really contradictingmyself: I know I say I hate the place but I still go here. But it’s Compton’s only gay outlet.And I have to support that in a way. Even though I don’t like the place, I have to. As Daniel[his boyfriend] would say “support the local [gay] economy.” (Warren)These comments highlight the limitations of managerial and social scientific approaches tohospitality that focus on food and drink transactions at the expense of its broader philosophicaland ethical dimensions. The perpetuation of hospitable space required rule and role governedinvestment. Patronage in this context reveals an asymmetric hospitality, in which transactions andobligations are not between individuals but between individuals and an imagined community.Patrons have obligations to the groups in the bar, the imagined community that patronized thevenue and to the bar as a hospitable space, which are fulfilled by their continued patronage andthe mobilization of social and economic capital.I am not arguing that all the customers demonstrated or were motivated by commitment togrand ideologies of queer space; indeed, patronage for most people was underpinned by themundane rewards of hospitality transactions that accompany consumption in any venue i.e. accessto alcohol, sociability etc. Moreover, many people expressed support for the Freelands inconversations, but patronized the bar very infrequently; therefore, their contributions to hospitablespace were limited to perpetuating the myth of commonality in their speech acts. Nevertheless,patronage for many others involved more than physical presence and the mobilization ofeconomic capital, which point to the broader imperatives of this space.Consumer participation in commercial hospitality provision included collecting glasses,ushering people in from the garden during the evenings, cleaning ashtrays, opening and closingdoors for people coming and leaving during after-hours drinks and serving drinks (see Lugosi,2003; 2007a). Customers also acted as door staff during events and often policed the bar,informing managers of incidents of improper conduct among staff. Several helped to run theweekly quiz, on a number occasions customers helped decorate the bar prior to events andoccasionally they put on transvestite shows during parties. A number of the regulars alsoaccompanied and sometimes even chauffeured managers during shopping trips to localsupermarkets. Small amounts of money were paid for some of these services, and most managersreciprocated with drinks, but much of this labour was unpaid.Consumer participation in the commercial operation suggests that discourses of hospitablespace elicited particular subjectivities and subjective experiences of the bar. The Freelands’operation can be read as interpellation (Althusser, 1984; Probyn, 2003) – a call to engagementwhich some consumers recognised and responded to through the provision and consumption ofhospitality. By doing so they submitted to the imperatives of hospitable space and became, asProbyn (2003) argued, subjects of the ideologies it embodied. This is not to imply naivety ormindless conformance on their part. Consumer participation was often linked to social andpsychological rewards. Those willing to help run the bar were allowed into the back and upstairsareas, where they could store their coats and socialize with staff and customers; theirmisdemeanours frequently received lighter sanctions and they were automatically invited to after-hours drinks. As the following interview extract suggests, for many consumers, contributing to thevenue’s operation reflected their involvement in the social practices of its operators and patrons.I love it behind the bar. I absolutely love it. It’s like I don’t always have the money to comeup to sit this side so if I’m that side of the bar I still get the atmosphere. I used to say toKeith “I’ll do it for nothing” because I just love being at that side of the bar and if I haven’tgot the money I can still be there and see friends and have a good crack. (Joyce)Finally, it is important to stress that commercial factors were part of the normative processesthat shaped consumer co-creation. The operation’s under-capitalisation increased staff-customerratios, which potentially compromised both the service quality and the range of services available.This necessitated the development of relationships that disrupted traditional provider-customerdivides. Playful, convivial interaction, inclusion in conversations, invitations to parties and lock-ins, and the exchange and consumption of drink and drugs were part of intimate, personaltransactions of hospitality that entangled patronage with notions of loyalty and obligation (seeLugosi, 2003). This subsequently helped to transform patronage into consumer labour thatcompensated for the lack of investment.SITUATIONAL DIMENSIONS OF HOSPITABLE SPACEI have so far argued that the production of hospitable space was underpinned by a number ofideological conceptions – namely the myths of commonality, safety and liberated play. I have alsomaintained that these were supported by normative processes that were shaped by the imperativesof hospitable space and by norms which were perpetuated through patronage. In this final section,I demonstrate further how notions of hospitableness surrounding the venue materialized in somesituations and disappeared in others, particularly through consumer practices and perceptions.One example of a co-created expression of hospitable space was the house cocktails: the“Fifi” and “Grandma” specials, which were invented by some of customers and staff. Onlyknowledgeable staff and a few regulars knew the ingredients, the bar did not normally servecocktails and they were not advertised. Neophytes were introduced to these drinks by existingpatrons, and when these new customers returned they frequently bought these drinks for thepeople who accompanied them during subsequent visits. The house cocktails reflect Selwyn’s(2000) argument that transactions of hospitality help to establish and reinforce social relations: thedrinks point to a process of consumer socialization and the articulation of shared knowledge.More importantly, such activities also reflect the emergent nature of hospitable space. Forexample, one of the regular customers, Darren, used to bring acquaintances to the bar and ask forhis “regular” when buying rounds of drinks. He used this to demonstrate his insider status and theunique consumer experiences offered by the Freelands. Consumption of the drinks became anactive process of remembrance and reification of the myths of commonality. The drinksreproduced the notions that the Freelands thrived because of the close-knit relationships betweenthe staff and customers, and that it was a hospitable space that facilitated hedonistic forms ofconsumption. However, it is also important to stress that knowledge of this ritual only survived aslong as patrons continued to enact them. After several of the regular customers who drank thesecocktails stopped coming to the Freelands, requests for these drinks also stopped and thismanifestation of hospitality disappeared.The fragile and situational nature of hospitable space continually became apparent throughconsumers’ occupation of the venue. For example:It was a really slow night and I was expecting to have an early night. […] Four women camein, all in their late 30s. They started drinking spirits and invited us to have a drink with them.[…] They asked to change the music and we gave them a few of our CDs to look through.They asked us to play 80s music, especially high-energy songs like the Weather Girls’ It’sRaining Men. Joanne kept telling me how she loved gay places and how she had been goingto gay clubs since she was 17. […] Darren was at the bar next to the women and startedtalking to Joanne when the subject of music came up. […] They all started dancing at the barand two of the women climbed up the wooden pillar [with a small table attached] and startedpole dancing. They carried on until one of them pulled the light off. Steve [the manager]didn’t seem too bothered. […] Darren had got up and was dancing too. Even Ken [one of themore conservative customers] was dancing. […] I left just before 2am.This diary extract highlights consumers’ ability to transform the venue into a temporary playspace and thus their ability to enact the myth of liberated play. Management contributed to theseludic moments by allowing these behaviours to take place, but such allowance only createdopportunities. These were then exploited by consumers as they reified the myth that the bar was asocial space in which established social conventions could be transgressed.Consumers also delineated hospitable space through selective exclusion. For example, after-hours drinks were a regular occurrence and trusted customers were often charged with lettingothers know about “lock-ins.” For a time, key customers were told to shepherd to one side of thebar all the people they wanted to stay inside after the official closing. One corner of the bar wouldsuddenly fill up tightly with people while those not invited were left standing in the middle of theempty bar. In other situations, exclusion was specifically aimed at individuals, for exampledisruptive, inebriated customers, who challenged the social order of the bar. As Moran et al.(2001) argued, the production of queer space is tied to discourses of property, assertions ofownership and the establishment of boundaries. Moreover, hospitableness/inhospitableness orinclusion/exclusion is not only enacted at the thresholds of space; rather, exclusion and boundariesare performed between specific actors in different moments in their ongoing production of space.The sharp enactments of group boundaries and exclusion during lock-ins revealed the iniquitousnature of hospitable space and the limitations imposed on the bar’s propositions. However,selective exclusion during other situations, when consumers defended their space from those whodisrupted the social order, reasserted the myth of commonality and the discourses of propriety.Selective exclusion, the collective defence of space and the incidents of playfulconsumption demonstrate how the myths of commonality, safety and liberated play wereentangled in the venue’s operation and in the consumers’ experience of hospitableness. However,these were short-lived and ephemeral; notions of hospitable space were tentative and could bedisrupted at anytime. This became acutely evident following a violent incident when one patron’sfamily members assaulted two of the bar’s regulars. The reactions to this incident reflected thefragility of the venue’s hospitality and the volatility of the myths of commonality and safety thatunderpinned notions of hospitable space. For some informants, the incident signalled the absenceof solidarity:You know there was that fight a couple of months ago? It proved that there is nosense of unity or togetherness. There were seven straight people there that wantedto cause a fight. As a gay community I think we should have stood up and said whatthe fuck do you think… [Pause]. Who the hell do you think you are? We didn’t. Wegot all frightened and scuttled away. What we should have done is say “there’smore of us, this is our pub!” It didn’t happen. There were kids running out terrified.(Warren)For others, this incident signalled the contrary and reflected a strong sense of community amongpatrons:When Mick, you know when Frank and his family started on him? And everyonewas like “if you want us down there we will come down there!” Me and Anna waslike “yeah, I’m there!” I think everyone sticks together. Whether it be a femalegetting their head kicked in or a male, everyone would just pile in. We all look after eachother in here. I know if I were in trouble, there is quite a few people I could turn to in here.(Joyce)The two assaulted men, Jamie and Mick, were apprehensive about going to the bar in caseFrank or members of his family came in; so, as a gesture of friendship and solidarity, Joyce andher friend offered to accompany them during subsequent visits. Several of the regulars threatenedthe manager with a boycott if he allowed Frank or his relations to drink in the bar. As a result, themanager barred Frank and his family.The myths of commonality were not coherent or consistent notions, althoughnetworks of support existed and certain individuals displayed visible emotionalcommitment towards each other. These fragmented and precarious myths ofcommonality thus emerged as patrons reasserted the hospitableness of space through theirpatronage. Their patronage signified their sense of shared interest and thus helped to perpetuatethe myths of commonality and safety. The incident with Frank and his family demonstrated howlived experience could easily undermine the imagined qualities of the bar. Nevertheless, the socialand economic capital that patrons could mobilize was used to reassert the notion that theFreelands was a site for the articulation of communal sentiment. Such a violent attack galvanizeda sense of mutuality, at least among a few of the core patrons, which in turn was realized in theirvisible and politicized consumption as they sought to reassert the myths surrounding theFreelands. Furthermore, the threats by certain key patrons to withhold their patronage and,consequently, the economic capital this brought with it, reinforced these myths of commonalityand the notion that this was a hospitable space for queer consumers.CONCLUSIONIt has been argued in this paper that a commercial venue may be transformed into ahospitable space for queer consumers through a series of social and spatial practices. Within theFreelands, the notion of a hospitable space was tied, in part at least, to propositions of hospitalityinvolving ludic consumption, discourses of inclusion, shared interest and safety which aredependent on ongoing patronage and visibility. These propositions linked this particular space tolarger, more complex social, political and economic geographies. The bar emerged as a hospitablespace in relation to other inhospitable (i.e. violent, hetero-normative) spaces; moreover, theFreelands was one landmark on a broader leisure landscape, and thus its operation was linked toother spaces that perpetuate similar offerings. Propositions of hospitality were reproduced partlythrough the management and organisation of the service operation. The bar’s operators attemptedto construct the commercial offering and shape customer perceptions of the venue. They displayedparticular objects to communicate queer values, organized community-oriented events and usedsuch organizational policies as after-hours drinking and dance-oriented music to create ahospitable space for its customers. However, the data suggests that these management initiativesattempted to blur boundaries between diverse groups of consumers, which actually excluded someconsumers and negated the hospitableness of the venue. Consumers also co-created discourses ofhospitality through patronage, representations of space, selective exclusion, but also through theirinvolvement in the commercial operation. Moreover, notions of hospitableness andinhospitableness emerged as consumers subjectively experienced it physically or psychologicallyin its symbolic, material and emotional forms.This paper also argued that the production of hospitable space can be conceived as havingan ideological, normative and situational dimension. In this case the ideological dimensioninvolved three frequently reproduced myths or ideological conceptions: commonality, safety andplay, which became entangled in the commercial proposition and the consumers’ experience of it.The normative dimension refers to the forces that draw consumers into the co-creation process.This involved a series of practices that help perpetuate the ideological conceptions of hospitablespace and sustain the commercial operation in which these conceptions are mobilized. Thesituational dimension refers to the unstable nature of the proposition and perceptions of it.Moreover, highlighting the situational dimension demonstrates how notions of hospitality areconstructed, reaffirmed and extinguished by consumers in different situations. In focusing onthese three dimensions the paper attempted to collapse the distinction between the commercial,social and philosophical understandings of hospitality. The production and consumption ofhospitable space can be viewed as attempts to manage the operation, orchestrate the consumerexperience, or position products or services within a marketplace; it can also be viewed as a seriesof social, cultural, political, ethical and symbolic actions. However, this paper has tried tounderstand how these different aspects of hospitable space can interact, and how differentconceptual approaches be brought together to create a nuanced, multi-disciplinary and multi-dimensional understanding of hospitality.The emergent themes developed in this paper contribute to several areas of academic debate.Firstly, identifying the social and cultural processes involved in the production of hospitality helpsto develop alternative perspectives on its management in commercial settings. In particular, thispaper helps to challenge existing managerial perspectives that have been criticized for assuming anarrow approach to the study of hospitality (Lashley et al, 2007; Lugosi, 2008). The managementwas able to mobilize a sense of loyalty, and commitment from the clientele played a significantrole in the ongoing existence of the bar. This is not to argue that management could orchestratefully consumer perceptions and behaviour. Nevertheless, numerous consumers displayed loyaltyto the Freelands and this paper highlights the factors that shaped their commitment.Secondly, the study highlights the application and limitations of sociological andanthropological approaches to hospitality that were exemplified by Selwyn (2000). Hospitalityundoubtedly has social functions in creating and developing relationships between individuals.Nevertheless, rather than separating its social and commercial forms, the Freelands casedemonstrates how the social aspects of hospitality transactions can affect the operation of thecommercial venue in which it is produced and consumed.  It is also evident that managerialattempts to produce particular discourses of hospitable space can shape the manifestations ofhospitality among consumers. However, the Freelands case also demonstrates that rather thanconceiving hospitality as a functional set of activities, purposively mobilized to build and developrelationships, hospitality is an emergent set of social practices and perceptions of the spaces inwhich they occur. For example, momentary displays of playful, transgressive consumptionhighlight the ability of staff and customers to articulate in particular situations the notion that thebar was a space where this was possible.Thirdly, the paper demonstrates the need to extend philosophical approaches to hospitalitybeyond the abstract discussions of migration and nationhood offered by Derrida (2000), Friese(2004) and others. Within the Freelands the construction of the proposition and its perpetuationthrough patronage had an ethical and political dimension. The implications of patronage stretchedbeyond the consumption of food or drink: for some consumers, it became the enactment ofsolidarity. This highlights the ways in which guests or consumers may therefore have obligations,not just to the hosts/commercial providers, but to other guests/consumers and the imaginedcommunity to which they belong. Nevertheless, as noted above, it is important to remain criticalof a functional view of hospitality and to remain sensitive towards its discontinuous and emergentnature.The paper also demonstrates that the notion of hospitality is not only useful in thinkingabout the welcoming of strangers; instead, hospitality becomes a broader concept with which tounderstand ongoing relationships between individuals in and through spaces. This also encouragesus to shift the emphasis from the notions of threshold, arrival and reception to the complexproductions of hospitable spaces, which helps to appreciate how inclusion and exclusion emergesat multiple points, and through a range of material, performative and representational processes.Fourthly, following on the previous point, the paper offers an alternative perspective onqueer consumers and bar cultures (cf, Beemyn, 1997; Moran et al, 2001). It has been argued herethat hospitality can be a conceptual tool with which to interrogate the dynamics of commercialspaces catering for queer consumers. Examining how hospitality in its multiple forms is co-created offers important insights into how notions of invisibility/visibility, community, property,ownership and belonging emerge. Furthermore, focusing on the offer or denial of hospitality in itsmundane, social and ethical forms helps to appreciate how acts of exclusion and boundarymaintenance shape discourses of queer space. Considering the emergence of hospitality also helpsto comprehend how queer spaces may be produced and experienced through various forms ofludic consumption and consumer participation (Lugosi, 2007a). Finally, examining commercialqueer spaces through hospitality also brings into focus the managerial aspects of a venue and theprocesses through which the necessary but fragile discourses of community, safety and playfulrejection of hetero-normative conventions may be mobilized in its operation. This illustrates howsocial and commercial forces interact to transform venues into inclusive spaces for someconsumers while excluding others. Examining queer space through notions of hospitality thushelps to analyse the entanglement of a broad range of agencies and processes involved in theirproduction. Moreover, such an analytical approach attempts to map the relationships betweenthem rather than necessarily privileging any one.Finally, the emerging themes of this paper point to the broadening horizon for the study ofhospitality as well as to an emerging paradigm for examining the relationship between society andspace. Following Bell (2007a), Derrida (2001) and Lashley et al. (2007), rather than viewing thestudy of hospitality as an end in itself, hospitality and hospitableness can be a lens through whichto view cultures and their spaces. This paper has demonstrated what the production of hospitablespace may involve and the various agencies and processes that can interact in its production. It hasalso been argued that interrogating the ideological and normative dimensions of hospitality, whilerecognizing its discontinuous, situational nature offers a way to understand how other places maybe transformed into hospitable spaces. Such analysis may not be restricted to commercial spheresof hospitality provision e.g. bars, restaurants, clubs, cafes, hotels, but to a range of domestic,social, commercial and public locations that people inhabit for work, leisure or travel. Futureresearch can offer nuanced, context sensitive perspectives on how other spaces become hospitableor inhospitable, or are experienced as such by those who occupy them. This can provide importantinsights into how notions of self/other, proximity/distance, freedom/constraint, work/play andinclusion/exclusion are developed, negotiated and articulated in other cultural contexts.NOTES1.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the processes through which a commercial bar is transformed into a hospitable space. Drawing on a study of a venue patronized by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual/transgender consumers, it considers how social and commercial forms of hospitality are mobilized. The paper argues that hospitable space has an ideological, normative and situational dimension. More specifically, it suggests the bar’s operation is tied to a set of ideological conceptions, which become the potential basis of association and disassociation among consumers. It examines the forces and processes that shape who participates in the production and consumption of hospitality and how. Finally, it considers the situational, emergent nature of hospitality and the discontinuous production of hospitable space. Rather than focusing exclusively on host-guest or provider-customer relations, which dominates existing work on hospitality, the paper examines how consumers’ perceptions, actions and interactions shape the production of hospitality. By doing so the paper offers an alternative approach to understanding queer spaces, bar operation as well as hospitality",
