AN EXAMINATION OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MESSAGE FRAMING, REGULATORY FOCUS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTANCE ON RISKY  HEALTH DECISION-MAKING AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS  by   Mallory B. Garza, B.S. M.A.        A Dissertation Presented in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree  Doctor of Philosophy       COLLEGE OF EDUCATION LOUISIANA TECH UNIVERSITY   August 2019   iii ABSTRACT   Excessive alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors are common health-related concerns among college campuses throughout the United States. Previous efforts to thwart such risky health behaviors have resulted in limited success. Therefore, it is crucial that researchers learn how to effectively communicate with college students in ways that increase healthy behaviors and decrease unhealthy behaviors among this particular population. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of message framing, regulatory focus, and psychological reactance on motivating college students to take a more proactive approach in regard to their health and wellbeing. Data from this study were collected from 318 college students ages 18 and older. Participants were recruited from undergraduate classes at a mid-sized public university in the southern United States. It was hypothesized that, when exposed to a gain-framed message, individuals with low psychological reactance and promotion-oriented regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions and will seek additional information regarding alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors significantly more than individuals with high psychological reactance and prevention-oriented regulatory focus exposed to a loss-framed message. Hypotheses were examined using Factorial ANOVAs. Results indicated a significant main effect for psychological reactance on behavioral intentions for both alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, such that those low in psychological reactance reported greater intentions not to participate in risky alcohol use or risky sexual behaviorsiv   in the future. Exploratory analysis for those low in psychological reactance revealed a significant interaction, such that individuals with a promotion-oriented regulatory focus exposed to a gain frame message reported lower behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors compared to those with a prevention-oriented regulatory focus exposed to a gain frame message and those with a promotion-oriented regulatory focus exposed to a loss frame message. Further research should explore message framing with low psychologically-reactant college students and their actual reported behaviors post message framing interventions.

Research has shown that, on average, approximately 1,700 college students die and over 500,000 college students are injured annually due to alcohol-related incidents (Hingson, Heeren, Winter, & Wechsler, 2005). Many college students meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. According to a study conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School, approximately 31% of college students met criteria for alcohol abuse and dependency, and approximately two-fifths reported at least one symptom of abuse or dependence (Knight, Wechsler, Kuo, Seibring, Weitzman, & Schuckit, 2002). Furthermore, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)—including HIV/AIDS—are among the most common contagious diseases in young adults (Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). Among developed nations, the United States has the highest rate of sexually transmitted infections (Caico, 2014). Nationally, adolescents have a greater risk of developing an STI than any other age group with nearly three million individuals procuring an STI annually, 62% of which are under the age of 25 (Caico). According to Dehne & Riedner (2005), young adults ages 15 to 24 are at highest risk for acquiring an STI with approximately half of all new cases each year acquired by individuals ages 2   15-24 (Child Trends Databank, 2017). A study evaluating risky sexual behaviors among U.S. college students between the ages of 17 and 25 revealed that 50.9% engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse (Caico, 2014). Of individuals poled, 42.4% reported that they do not consider themselves knowledgeable about sexually transmitted infections (STIs), 58.1% reported the use of alcohol before or during sexual intercourse, and 12.4% of females had unplanned pregnancies (Caico, 2014). In addition to posing serious health threats, the number of STIs acquired annually also presents significant economic threats. For example, the lifetime medical cost of STI incidence in young adults ages 15-24 were estimated at approximately $6.5 billion in 2000 (Child Trends Databank, 2017).  This evolves into an even greater area of concern as it becomes apparent that, even with the increased awareness and knowledge regarding the dangers of risky drug use and risky sexual behaviors, such behaviors persist among college students. In order to rectify this issue, research has begun to explore the relationship between college students’ health behaviors and message framing. Proposed as a way of maximizing an individual’s intentions to perform (or not perform) a given behavior, such as adhering to a healthy diet, implementing a consistent workout regimen, or avoiding alcohol in excess, message framing has evolved into an area of interest within the fields of social psychology, marketing, and medicine. These issues ultimately inspire questions as to how we can convince or persuade people to engage in healthy behaviors.    Various research on the effectiveness of health communication appeals have attempted to thwart problems of alcohol and drug use and risky sexual behaviors on college campuses throughout the United States (Bartels, Kelly, & Rothman, 2010; Gerend & Cullen, 2008; Pilling & Brannon, 2007; Wechsler, Seibring, I-Chao, & Ahl, 3   2004). Such research has inspired questions as to what kinds of persuasive appeals are most effective in dissuading college students from engaging in risky health behaviors and persuading them to adopt more beneficial health practices. Research has demonstrated that the effectiveness of a health behavioral appeal is contingent upon how the appeal is presented (Rothman & Salovey, 1997). Health appeals can be framed either in terms of how one may benefit from engaging in a particular behavior (gain-frame) or what one may lose by not engaging in a particular behavior (loss-frame). Studies indicate that gain-framed messages are more effective when advocating a behavior that prevents the onset of some health issue (such as the regular use of sunscreen in order to prevent developing skin cancer), whereas loss-framed messages are more effective in appealing to a person when advocating a behavior that detects a potential health issue (such as seeking breast exams for the detection of breast cancer) (Rothman, Bartels, Wlaschin, & Salovey, 2006; Rothman & Salovey, 1997).  Understanding, explaining, and predicting people’s decisions and behaviors are generally derived from the assumption that humans behave rationally (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Though the definition of rationality has been a point of contention and debate within the social sciences, there is general agreement that rational choices satisfy basic “requirements of consistency and coherence” (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981, p. 453). In their 1981 evaluation of the framing of decisions and the decisions people make, Tversky and Kahneman define a decision problem as “the acts or options among which one must choose the possible outcomes or consequences of these acts, and the contingencies or conditional probabilities that relate outcomes to acts” (p 453). The term decision frame is defined as “the decision-maker’s conception of the acts, outcomes, and 4   contingencies associated with a particular choice” (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981, p. 453). The frame that a decision-maker adopts, and the subsequent decision the decision-maker selects, is greatly influenced by the way the message is presented as well as various situational factors and personal characteristics unique to the decision-maker.  Thus, a key factor that may be considered is how the presented outcome of persuasive message attempts influences the decision-making process. As noted by Tversky and Kahneman, the psychological phenomena “that govern the perception of decision problems and the evaluation of probabilities and outcomes produce predictable shifts of preference when the same problem is framed in different ways” (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981, p. 453). The dependence of preferences on the way in which a problem is framed presents a substantial concern for the theory of rational choice (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Tversky and Kahenman’s (1979) prospect theory offers an attempt to understand the process of decision-making through persuasive message attempts in the context of human behavior when individuals are presented with uncertain versus certain outcomes. Thus, prospect theory poses a descriptive model of decision-making as influenced by one’s perception of the risk involved. According to prospect theory, people tend to make decisions based on perceived gains more so than they do based on perceived losses.   Statement of the Problem   Excessive alcohol and risky sexual behaviors are common problems frequently associated with college students. Previous efforts to thwart excessive alcohol use and protect against risky sexual behaviors have resulted in limited success. Researchers are now exploring other avenues for improving health behaviors among college students. 5   Therefore, it is crucial that researchers learn how to effectively communicate with college students in ways that college-age individuals understand, appreciate, and value.  Broadly speaking, message framing is currently being researched and applied to the college population in order to inspire behavioral changes that help individuals lead healthier and more productive lives. It is necessary and vital to discover ways of increasing healthy behaviors and decreasing unhealthy behaviors among young adults. However, creating interventions that lead to healthy changes in behavior has not proved to be an easy task. Promotional messages of all types permeate throughout modern culture and society (Miller, Lane, Deatrick, Young, & Potts, 2007), and although social influence research has focused on improving various strategies capable of producing the most effective messages, there still remain various hurdles that must be overcome. This is especially true when considering promotional health messages aimed at resistant, uncooperative, or defiant young adult populations (Miller et al., 2007). Such obstacles include constructing messages that are explicit in purpose, yet can attract the consumer’s attention, appeal to the consumer’s sensibilities, and are personalized to what the consumer is willing to consider or endorse. Such tasks are not always simple and often prove to be inconsequential. In other scenarios, messages may result in the undesirable effect of alienating the intended audience or consumer (Miller et al., 2007).  Under the theoretical frameworks of prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) and psychological reactance (Brehm, 1966), this dissertation hopes to extend the literature by evaluating the relationship between message frames and individual factors, including regulatory focus and psychological reactance, on risky health decision-making among college students.  6   Justification  While a host of professionals continue to devote time, energy, and resources into improving healthy behaviors among college students, the need for effective communication in such endeavors becomes increasingly more apparent. It is essential that such messages be transmitted in ways that matter to the targeted audience. As the trendsetters for future generations, college students are a specific population in need of targeting. Furthermore, considering the prevalence of alcohol and drug use as well as risky sexual behaviors amongst this population, it seems logical to assess for and work to prevent these health concerns among college students.  Research has demonstrated that many college students meet diagnostic criteria for substance abuse (Hingson, Heeren, Winter, & Wechsler, 2005) and engage in risky sexual behaviors (Caico, 2014), such as the absence of condom use during sexual intercourse. One type of substance abuse that appears to be particularly prevalent in college students is alcohol use disorder. Per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental Disorder, fifth edition (DSM-5), alcohol use disorder is characterized by a persistent and problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairments or distress as manifested by at least two of eleven criteria over the course of a 12-month period (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Issues pertaining to excessive drug and alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors are of growing concern considering the sheer rise in numbers of college students who suffer from one if not both of these problems. Due to the variety of potentially negative consequences for engaging in these risky behaviors, some of which include negative impact on cognitive functioning, general health, overall wellbeing, sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted 7   pregnancies, it is becoming increasingly necessary to discover ways of communicating the potential health risks of these behaviors in ways that will lead to actual behavioral change, rather than simply intent to change. Using message framing to help educate society and reduce these health-related concerns among college students is an area of growing interest. It is also imperative that such messages be carefully scrutinized to assess for potential negative consequences that may inadvertently be created.  Currently, there exists a gap in the literature that addresses how message framing can influence behaviors related to drug and alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors among college students. Perhaps through the use of appropriate education and campaigns around drug and alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, a great number of poor health decisions in these domains may be prevented, thereby eradicating many of the drug, alcohol and sex-related problems that young adults across all college and university campuses throughout the country face today. Questions that must be asked include whether college students respond more favorably to drug, alcohol and risky sexual behavior recommendations presented in terms of gains or in terms of losses, and how personal factors influence those outcomes. The acquisition of such knowledge is vital in its potential application to help young adults. Universities may be able to design courses in which college students are presented with knowledge in these health domains in such a way that students are more likely to engage in actual behavioral change (or prevention). Furthermore, such knowledge may help bolster the development of effective health-promotion interventions for college students. The theory of psychological reactance and prospect theory, which posits that individuals are more likely to be risk-averse when considering potential gains and 8   risk-seeking when considering potential losses, are two primary perspectives by which one can better conceptualize and come to understand the effects of message framing and decision-making. The theory of psychological reactance (Brehm, 1966, 1972; Brehm & Brehm, 1981) offers an explanatory framework by which we can attempt to understand the various obstacles and outcomes that must be overcome in order to produce effective health-related appeals. The conceptualization of how individuals are likely to become psychologically aroused when they perceive that their behavioral freedoms are threatened from overtly persuasive messages can allow us to alter persuasive attempts in ways that alleviate or eliminate the aversive arousal altogether (Miller et al., 2007).  Recent research suggests that using certain types of narratives may help protect against resistance to messages intended to persuade an individual to endorse an item or idea (Bilandzic & Busselle, 2013; Moyer-Gusé, 2008; Moyer-Gusé & Nabi, 2010; Quick, Kam, Morgan, Montero, & Smith, 2015). Specifically, certain features or type of message content may influence the likelihood that an individual will endorse a certain item or behavior (Quick et al., 2015; Quick, Shen, & Dillard, 2012). Although research has explored aspects of message design in a broad context, there currently exists a gap in the literature that explores and understands the mechanisms by which specific narrative, language content, or individual differences may play a role in reducing an individual incentive to reject what is being advocated (reactance; Dillard & Shen, 2005) (Bilandzic & Busselle; Quick et al., 2015).  Using message framing in order to educate society and reduce frequency of risky drug, alcohol, and sexual behaviors among college students is an area of growing interest and concern. However, it is crucial that such messages be carefully evaluated to assess 9   for potential negative consequences that may be unintentionally created. As research suggests, pretesting health messages prior to initiating public health campaigns may help prevent the stigmatization of certain groups (Gollust, Niederdeppe, & Barry, 2013).   Literature Review  History of Message Framing  When delivering a health-related message or persuasive appeal, the information must be conveyed in such a way as to not only impact one’s thoughts and feelings, but one’s behaviors as well (Rothman, Bartels, Wlaschin, & Salovey, 2006). As health-related concerns continue to make headlines, it is crucial that when individuals are confronted with health information that they either initiate or maintain healthy behaviors (Rothman et al., 2006). Thus, areas pertaining to message framing and health-related behaviors have become increasingly researched. Research indicates that effective health appeals are largely determined based on how the message is presented, or more specifically, how the message is framed (Bartels, Kelly, & Rothman, 2010).   Health messages can be framed in terms of the potential benefits of engaging in a particular behavior or in terms of the potential costs of choosing not to engage in the behavior (Sherman, Mann, & Updegraff, 2006). Gain-framed messages accentuate the benefits of engaging in health-promoting behaviors, whereas loss-framed messages emphasize the losses of engaging in risky behaviors or failing to engage in health-promoting behaviors (Sherman et al., 2006). Thus, gain-frame messages account for what one may gain and loss-frame messages account for what one may lose. These health-related decisions, however, are not trivial and extensive efforts to help individuals make the best-informed health-related decisions possible are essential.  10   Framing is considered the switch in an individual’s choice when different language is used to describe objectively equivalent problems (Kahneman & Tversky, 1981). Depending on the type of language utilized in any given problem (the way in which a message is presented or framed), individuals may display behaviors categorized as either risk-seeking or risk-averse. Risk-seeking behavior is exhibited when an individual, presented with two alternatives, selects the riskier of the two choices. Risk-averse behavior is exhibited when an individual, presented with two alternatives, selects the least risky of the choices. Research has traditionally indicated that individuals tend to be risk-averse when outcomes are presented in terms of gains and risk-seeking when outcomes are presented in terms of losses (Kahneman & Tversky, 1981; Mahoney, Buboltz, Levin, Doverspike, Svyantek, 2011). However, subsequent research has suggested that the effects of message framing on risky choices may not be universal (Fagley & Miller, 1990; Fischhoff, 1983). The variety of results in research regarding message framing has led to a series of petitions for research that confirms when and where framing influences risky decision-making (Mahoney et al., 2011).  The relevance of framing in psychological research emerged from Tversky and Kahneman’s (1981) examination of the framing effect. Individual choices are often considered as being founded on the assumption that humans base their decisions on processes involving rationality, and thereby satisfy basic “requirements of consistency and coherence” (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981, p. 453). The term decision frame is used to refer to an individual’s conception of the behaviors, consequences, and contingencies that accompany a particular decision (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981).  11   Tversky and Kahneman (1981) demonstrated that individuals display a tendency to reverse decisions depending on the way in which a given problem is presented, even when the outcomes of all message frames are objectively equivalent. An example of this phenomenon may be exhibited in the famous “Asian Disease problem” (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Participants were asked to imagine as though the U.S. was preparing for an outbreak of a lethal pandemic, expected to kill 600 people. Two options were presented as a means of combating the virulent disease, and participants were asked to make a decision between the two. Each of the options presented were done so using a different frame. Option One presented a positive (gain) frame, whereby participants were told that if Treatment A was implemented 200 people would be saved, and if Treatment B was implemented there would be a 1/3 chance that 600 people would be saved and a 2/3 chance that no one would be saved. Treatment A presented an argument such that 200 lives were sure to be saved. This simultaneously implied that 400 lives were sure to be lost, though this information was not explicitly stated. Treatment B presented an argument such that there is a 1/3 chance that 600 lives are saved and a 2/3 chance that 600 lives are lost. Researchers found that the majority of individuals chose Treatment A, the risk-averse decision, where there was a guarantee that 200 individuals would be saved, even at the expense of a guaranteed 400 lives lost. In this instance, it appears as though the majority of individuals would rather ensure a number of saved lives versus the risk of a greater number of lives lost. Option Two presented a negative (loss) frame. For the same pandemic threat problem, a separate group of participants were told that if Treatment C were implemented 400 people would die, and if Treatment D were implemented there would be a 2/3 chance 12   that 600 people would die and a 1/3 chance that no one would die. Option Two presented the same risks in both treatments as does Option One (Treatments A and B), but the language changed in Option Two to emphasize the loss (400 die) over the gain (200 live). Treatment C presented an argument such that 400 lives were sure to be lost. This simultaneously implied that 200 lives were sure to be saved, though this information was not explicitly stated. Thus, Treatment C of Option Two is equivalent to Treatment A of Option One. Treatment D presented an argument such that there was a 2/3 chance that 600 lives would be lost and a 1/3 chance that 600 lives would be saved. Thus, Treatment D of Option Two is equivalent to Treatment B of Option One. However, in this sample, the majority of participants chose Treatment D, the risk-seeking option. Although the same objective data was presented in both messages and the mathematical probabilities are equivalent, the change in responses between the two participant groups differed. Tversky and Kahneman (1981) describe this difference as being due to the way each problem was framed. Participants tend to select the certain option, avoiding risk, when presented with a positive (gain) frame, as evidenced in Option One. Participants tend to select the riskier option when presented with a negative (loss) frame, as evidenced in Option Two.  According to Mahoney and colleagues (2011), there exist three primary aspects of message framing research. These include the frame, which refers to the perception of an expected gain or loss when a particular option is presented to the decision maker. The second component is the content, which refers to the specific language utilized within the given frame. The content is contingent upon whether the message is presented as either a 13   gain or a loss. Finally, there are the characteristics of the individual who receives the message, or rather, the decision maker.  One of the most significant situational effects on risky decision-making is the effect of message framing (Mahoney, Buboltz, & Levin, 2011). Mahoney and colleagues (2011) define framing as the change in an individual’s preference based on the language utilized, or how a message is presented, even when describing objectively equivalent problems. Thus, message framing is the manipulation of language in an attempt to alter the attitudes or behaviors of others. In particular, message framing refers to whether a persuasive appeal refers to the positive consequences of adopting a behavior (gain-frame) or the negative consequences of adopting a behavior (loss-frame) (Mahoney et al., 2011).  According to Garcia-Retamero and Cokely (2011), two primary perspectives have guided the current research regarding message framing and health-related behaviors. The first perspective involves whether the function of health-related behaviors moderates the influence of message frames (Rothman & Salovey, 1997 as cited in Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). The second perspective involves the extent to which individual differences moderate the relationship between message frames and health behaviors (Mann, Sherman, & Updegraff, 2004). However, exploration into how these two perspectives may be related is still relatively sparse within the scientific community.  The concept of the function of message framing as a moderator of the effectiveness of message frames was founded on the basis of Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981 as cited in Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). The basic premise of Prospect Theory is that people are more likely to display behaviors characterized as risk-averse when considering potential gains as a 14   result of their behaviors, whereas people are more likely to display behaviors characterized as risk-seeking when considering potential losses as a result of their behaviors (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Prospect theory defines risk as “the probability that a particular outcome might occur” (Rothman, Bartels, Wlaschin, & Salovey, 2006). Hence, the prospect that a given health message would influence an individual’s behavior would largely depend on whether the individual perceived the outcome of the behavior as risky. To the extent that a behavior permits a relatively low risk of some negative outcome (i.e., that a behavior may help prevent the onset of some health problem; e.g., “daily exercise may prevent heart disease”), gain-frame appeals are likely to be more effective. Conversely, to the extent that the behavior permits a relatively high risk of some negative outcome (i.e., that a behavior may help detect a health problem; e.g., “regular breast examinations can help detect onset of breast cancer and save your life”), loss-frame appeals are likely to be more effective (Rothman et al., 2006; Salovey & Wegener, 2003 as sited in Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011).  Congruent with these hypotheses, research demonstrates that gain-frame messages tend to be more persuasive regarding the promotion of health-related preventative behaviors such as physical exercise (Jones, Sinclair, & Courtney, 2003), reduced alcohol consumption (Gerend & Cullen, 2008), smoking cessation (Schneider et al., 2001b), and skin cancer (Rothman, Salovey, Antone, Keough, & Martin, 1993). Gain-frame appeals, however, have not proven to be effective for promoting certain health-related preventative behaviors such as acquiring vaccinations against the flu (McCaul, Johnson, & Rothman, 2002) or the human Papillomavirus (HPV; Gerend, Shepherd, & Monday, 2008).  15   Rothman and colleagues conducted a study in which participants were presented with message frames promoting the use of a mouth rinse designed to either (1) prevent plaque buildup (i.e., prevention behavior) or (2) detect the buildup of plaque (i.e., detection behavior) (Rothman, Martino, Bedell, Detweiler, & Salovey, 1999, 2003 as sited in Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). Results of the study indicated that participants were more likely to request the plaque-preventing rinse after being presented with a gain-frame message, whereas participants were more likely to request the plaque-detecting rinse after being presented with a loss-frame message (Rothman et al., 1999, 2003). These findings in which a single health behavior (e.g., mouth wash) serves both prevention and detection functions, and having been replicated in randomized trials (e.g., Rivers, Salovey, Pizarro, Pizarro, & Schneider, 2005), have become some of the most convincing evidence that framing effects are dependent upon the function (i.e., prevention or detection) of the promoted behavior (Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011).  Other factors appear to influence the persuasiveness of message frames as well. In a study conducted by Garcia-Retamero and Cokely (2011), for example, researchers investigated the influence of message frames in promoting health behaviors aimed at preventing and detecting STDs. In addition to investigating the effectiveness of message frames on health prevention and detection behaviors, as well as potential mediating factors such as risk perception, researchers aimed to evaluate the persuasiveness of visual aids on sexual health risk communication. Research demonstrates that risk information presented via visual aids is perceived as easier to comprehend (Goodyear-Smith et al., 2008 as sited in Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011) and significantly increases risk avoidance (Schirillo & Stone, 2005 as sited in Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). 16   According to Garcia-Retamero and Cokely (2011), investigating the content and structure of message frames could have significant implications for detection and prevention efforts, including those related to sex education, medical care, and economic threats.  Congruent with their hypotheses, participants presented with the gain-frame message perceived the message as placing greater emphasis on the benefits of adopting the advocated behavior than on the disadvantages of failing to adopt the advocated behavior (Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). Participants who were presented with the loss-frame message evaluated the message as placing a greater emphasis on the costs associated with failing to adopt the advocated behavior than on the benefits associated with adopting the advocated behavior (Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). Similarly, participants presented with the gain-frame messages indicated that the tone of the message was overall more positive, whereas those presented with the loss-framed message indicated that the overall tone of the message was more negative (Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011).  Research also reveals significant differences in risk perceptions (e.g., Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). Participants presented with a message promoting the use of STI screening, for example, indicated feeling at greater risk than did participants presented with a message promoting condom use (Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). Detection tasks (e.g., STI screening) may pose a greater perceived threat than that of prevention tasks (e.g., condom use) due to the nature of detection tasks to potentially reveal an undesired health threat to the individual; thus, individuals are more likely to perceive detection tasks as posing greater risks than that of preventions tasks (Rothman & Salovey, 1997; Rothman, Salovey, Antone, Keough, Martin, 1993).  17   There also appears to be differences regarding perception and decision-making based on how the information is presented visually. Congruent with the researchers’ hypotheses, when risk information was provided in written text only or in written text and numerically, participants presented with the gain-framed message advocating the use of condoms reported stronger intentions to perform the advocated behavior than those who read the loss-framed message (Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). Moreover, participants presented with the gain-framed message reported greater actual behavioral change (i.e., condom use) than did those presented with the loss-framed message (Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). In contrast, however, participants presented with the loss-framed message promoting STI screening reported both stronger intentions to endorse the promoted health behavior (i.e., to schedule an appointment with their doctor and request STI screening) and greater actual behavioral change (i.e., scheduling an appointment with their doctor and acquiring STI screening) than did the participants presented with the gain-frame message (Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). Finally, results of the study revealed that written text and graphically presented information were equally effective in influencing participants’ intentions to perform the behavior and reported behaviors in both gain- and loss-framed messages (Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011). Garcia-Retamero and Cokely posit that their research findings suggest “an efficient and effective way to communicate health information about STDs promoting prevention and detection behaviors to the group of people at highest risk without any noteworthy costs” (Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2011, p. 282).  The framing effect, first explained in terms of prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981), incorporates an individual’s perception of 18   the level of risk, defined as, “the probability that a particular outcome might occur” (Rothman et al., 2006), involved when making a decision. The individual must make a decision between two opposing options, which may be classified as being either risk-averse or risk-seeking. A person may be classified as risk-averse if he or she prefers a certain prospect or outcome as compared to an uncertain one. In contrast, a person may be classified as risk-seeking if he or she prefers an uncertain prospect or outcome to a certain one. Prospect theory postulates that people demonstrate a tendency to overweight outcomes perceived as certain and underweight those perceived as simply probable (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Kahneman and Tversky labeled this phenomenon as the certainty effect. For example, consider the following problems posed by Kahneman and Tversky, in which individuals were asked to choose between two options in each of the following two problems. The number of respondents who participated is represented as N, and the percentage that chose each available option is presented in brackets:  PROBLEM A:   Option 1: An 80% chance of winning $8,000, N = 95 [20]  Option 2: A sure win of $3,000, N = 95 [80]* PROBLEM B:   Option 1: A 20% chance of winning $4,000, N = 95 [65]*  Option 2: A 25% chance of winning $3,000, N = 95 [35] As demonstrated in the analysis, when presented with Problem A, the majority of individuals (80%) chose Option 2, a sure gain of $3,000. However, when presented with Problem B, the majority of individuals (65%) chose Option 1, a 20% chance of winning $4,000 as opposed to a 25% chance of winning $3,000. The implication is that the change 19   produces a decreased attraction when it changes the nature of the prospect from a certainty to merely a probability. Thus, reducing the probability from 1.0 to 0.25 has a greater effect than reducing the probability from 0.8 to 0.2 (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).  There are other factors that may influence one’s proclivity toward risk-seeking versus risk-averse behaviors. For instance, consider a situation in which winning is possible, though not necessarily probable. Note the following two problems initially proposed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979):  PROBLEM C:   Option 1: 45% chance of winning $6,000, N = 66 [14]  Option 2: 90% chance of winning $3,000, N = 66 [86]* PROBLEM D:   Option 1: 0.1% chance of winning $6,000, N = 66 [73]*   Option 2: 0.2% chance of winning $3,000, N = 66 [27] The options in Problem C present substantial probabilities of winning (0.90 and 0.45), and the majority of individuals (86%) chose the option that presented the highest probability of winning. The options in Problem D present miniscule probabilities of winning in both instances (0.001 and 0.002). In such a situation where winning was possible but not probable, the majority of individuals chose the option that offered the largest probable gain, with 73% of subjects choosing Option 1 (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).   Tversky (1972) notes that, in efforts to simplify a choice between two alternatives, people will often disregard the aspects or characteristics that the two options share, and instead focus on the aspects or characteristics that set them apart. However, 20   this often leads to an inconsistency in preferences because alternatives may be distinguished based on more than one set of distinctive or unique factors, which may lead to differing preferences depending on the situation and context. Nonetheless, individuals often engage in a reversal of preferences based upon the dependency among the components of presented alternatives and not solely by the probabilities of the outcomes of each presented alternative. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) refer to this phenomenon as the isolation effect, which implies that the contingency of a fixed outcome increases the attractiveness of that alternative compared to the one that is perceived as riskier, despite equivalent outcome probabilities (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). To demonstrate this phenomenon, Kahneman and Tversky proposed the following dilemma:   PROBLEM E: You have been given $1,000 and are asked to choose between   Option 1: ($1,000, 0.50), N = 70 [16]   Option 2: ($500), N = 70 [84]*  PROBLEM F: You have been given $2,000 and are asked to choose between   Option 1: (-$1,000, 0.50), N = 68 [69]*   Option 2: (-$500), N = 68 [31] Problem E presents the decision maker with a 50% chance of gaining another $1,000 (Option 1) or a 100% certainty of gaining another $500 (Option 2). The majority of individuals (84%) selected Option 2, the certainty of a gain. Problem F presents the decision maker with a 50% chance of losing $1,000 (Option 1) or a certainty of losing $500 (Option 2). Here, the majority of individuals (69%) selected Option 1. If the alternatives for both Problems E and F present equivalent probabilities, what contributes to the difference in decision making for these problems? The isolation effect plays a 21   significant role in this scenario because, although the problems present statistically equivalent outcome probabilities, the reversal of preferences is due to contingent certainties and the specific components that distinguish between the two problems (i.e., being given $1,000 versus being given $2,000 prior to the decision making requirement). Thus, individuals appear to be risk-averse when presented with positive prospects and risk-seeking when presented with negative ones, even when the outcomes are equivalent (Kahenman & Tversky, 1979).  As indicated, prospect theory postulates that, for a given problem, the first option is often presented with a certain outcome, while the second option is uncertain (Rothman et al., 2006). However, congruent with the previous examples, prospect theory further suggests that how an option is framed also plays a significant role in the decision-making process. For instance, positively framed problems emphasize profits (gain-frame), and negatively framed problems emphasize risks (loss-frame). Thus, when individuals are given a problem and required to contemplate benefits, they are more likely to be risk-averse, but when given a problem and required to contemplate potential losses, they are more likely to be risk-seeking. In accordance with prospect theory, the framing hypothesis predicts that when behavioral decisions involve some degree of risk, individuals are likely to become more risk-seeking than when the decision is framed in terms of losses or disadvantages (Mahoney, Buboltz, & Levin, 2011). Conversely, when behavioral decisions involve potential gains or advantages, individuals are more likely to be risk-averse.  Theories of Message Frames. Prospect theory, while incorporating the involvement of risk perception in the decision making process, challenged the 22   fundamental assumptions of expected utility theory, predominating prior to the evolution of prospect theory, and posits that the expected value of a decision is a product of the utility and risk involved (Mahoney, Buboltz, Levin, 2011). Expected utility theory accounts for an individual’s decision-making process assuming that they must select a single alternative from a recognized set of options (Fishburn, 1970). Expected utility theory posits that an individual’s preference will govern his decision making process in accordance with selecting a decision that better aligns with his preferences than the less-preferred alternative (Fishburn, 1970). According to expected utility theory, when an individual is posed with a choice between two or more options, he or she will always select the choice that presents the highest expected value, and that such a decision should be invariant across frames, both negative (loss) and positive (gain) (Tversky & Fox, 1995). However, as explicitly demonstrated by Tversky and Kahneman (1981), one’s perception of risk in the decision-making process is much more complex than originally conceptualized by expected utility theory.   Based on prospect theory, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) posited that, when presented with a decision, individuals do not always behave rationally because individual perceptions impact the decision-making process. Researchers found that, more often than not, individuals tend to place greater value on losses than on equivalent gains, such that the response to a loss is much greater than the response to a gain (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Kahneman and Tversky (1979) found that individuals utilize points of reference when engaging in decision-making processes, and that individuals organize information relevant to a decision based upon their respective reference points. Furthermore, the way in which a problem is framed may lead to modification of one’s 23   reference point, subsequently impacting whether information is encoded as a loss or a gain, and thereby changing the individuals’ preference or decision. This implies that the framing of a choice in one’s mind, in terms of a loss or a gain, can alter one’s decision for a promoted message outcome that is not necessarily rational (Mahoney, Buboltz, & Levin, 2011). Whichever frame the decision-maker adopts is largely influenced by the formulation of the problem and the personal characteristics of the individual. Kahneman and Tversky (1981) suggested that decisions may be mediated by many factors, including an individual’s perception of the potential consequences, the individual’s heuristic processes, the context of the presented problem, one’s personal life experiences, and how or when one receives the message. Other researchers (Mahoney et al., 2011) suggested that individual differences might play a role in message framing, outcome perception, and decision-making processes as well.  Other popular theories of message framing include Dual Process Theory, the Elaboration Likelihood Model, Self-Discrepancy Theory, and Approach and Avoidance Motivation. Dual Process Theory explores the idea that people have two minds or two fundamental systems by which we engage in cognitive reasoning (Evans & Frankish, 2008). The first system is described as associative, automatic, unconscious, and fast, whereas the second system is controlled, conscious, and slow, yet much more thorough and rational compared to its counterpart (Evans & Frankish).  The Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) is an example of a type of Dual Process Theory, and posits that differences in the nature of persuasion are a function of the likelihood that an individual will elaborate (i.e., contemplate) information pertinent to the object of persuasion (O’Keefe, 2008). In other 24   words, persuasiveness will depend, in large part, on the extent to which the individual thinks about the issue. Depending on the degree to which the individual thinks about, or elaborates upon, the issue, two types of persuasion can result: (1) “systematic thinking” or (2) “cognitive shortcuts” (O’Keefe, 2008, p. 1475). The outcome of persuasive attempts will be influenced by different factors depending on which persuasive route is taken. The first route, which involves systematic thinking, is referred to as the central route and represents the persuasion process in which elaboration is relatively high (O’Keefe). The details of the central route process involve close scrutiny of the persuasive message and careful consideration of potential implications. The second route, referred to as the peripheral route, involves taking cognitive shortcuts whereby the individual engages relatively low elaboration. The peripheral route often involves decision-making based on some heuristic or simple rule of decision-making and involves less cognitive effort (O’Keefe).  Self-Discrepancy Theory (Higgins, 1987) posits that there are three self-state representations: (1) actual self (i.e., how one perceives he or she currently exists; self-concept), (2) ideal self (i.e., representation of how an individual perceives him or herself in relation to his or her desire and goals), and (3) ought self (i.e., representation of how an individual perceives his or her duties, responsibilities, and obligations) (Higgins, 1987). Self-discrepancy theory posits that different types of self-discrepancies (e.g., a discrepancy between one’s perceived actual self and ought self) present varying degrees of psychological discomfort. Differences both in the relative magnitude of the perceived discrepancy and in the type or relationship of discrepancy result in varying relative discomfort one is likely to experience. Studies regarding self-discrepancy theory and 25   decision-making (Crowe & Higgins, 1997) have indicated that self-discrepancies, when resulting in the subsequent experience of psychological discomfort, can influence strategies or cognitive patterns and problem solving. Approach and Avoidance Motivation Theory (Elliot, 1999) posits that “approach and avoidance motivation differ as a function of valence” (Elliot & Covington, 2001, p. 73). In approach motivation, behavior is the subsequent result of a perceived positive or desirable event, whereas in avoidance motivation, behavior is the subsequent result of a perceived negative or undesirable event (Elliot, 1999; Elliot & Covington, 2001). Researchers contend that the distinction between approach and avoidance motivation is the foundation upon which other motivational forces rest (Elliot & Covington). As such, it has been conceived that differences in decision making is contingent upon these distinctions.  Framing Effects in Decision-Making Processes Framing effects may be defined as preference reversals (Mahoney, Buboltz, Levin, Doverspike, & Svyantek, 2011). According to researchers, the most precise standard for a framing effect is the “preference reversal,” where positively framed problems result in risk-averse decision-making and negatively framed problems result in risk-seeking decision-making (Mahoney et al., 2011, p. 249). However, there is another common pattern of decision-making, whereby individuals will demonstrate a “preference shift,” and will more often endorse choices perceived as risky when presented with a loss (negative) frame than when presented with a gain (positive) frame (Levin, Schneider, & Gaeth, 1998). This preference shift is deemed as a more liberal and contemporary view regarding risky decision making, as compared to the more traditional and rigid view 26   involving an actual reversal in decision-making, continent upon the message frame (Mahoney et al., 2011).   Research indicates that there may be multiple domains in which the effects of framing occur, and that framing effects may differ amongst each of these domains. Blais and Weber (2006) have recognized five domains within framing effects and decision-making: (1) ethical (e.g., cheating on an exam terminating life support), (2) financial (gambling, investments), (3) health and safety (e.g., wearing a seatbelt, smoking, drug use, multiple sexual partners without the use of protection), (4) recreational (bungee jumping, skydiving), and (5) social (e.g., confronting family or colleagues).  While Prospect Theory has provided the foundation upon which health-related message framing research was conceptualized, the theory has limitations concerning the presentation of health message and actual behavioral health interventions. Prospect Theory demands that individuals choose between two opposing alternatives; health promotion messages are constructed in such a way as to compel individual to either engage or not engage in a specified behavior (Rothman, Bartels, Wlaschin, & Salovey, 2006). According to Rothman and Salovey (1997), contextual factors are likely to influence an individual’s perception of gains and losses associated with either endorsing or not endorsing the advocated behavior. Thus, while Prospect Theory poses significant implications for health-related behavioral research, assumptions should be considered within the context in which the health behaviors are being advocated (Rothman & Salovey, 1997).  Limitations in human perception and decision-making, including those related to or influenced by contextual factors (Rothman & Salovey, 1997), often result in a change 27   of opinion or choice based on how the information is presented or framed. Regardless of the behavioral health message, information can be easily presented in terms of gains and losses. For example, a message advocating that individuals engage in physical exercise may be presented as a gain-frame (e.g., “Regular exercise can supply you with an energized feeling and improve your physical health”) or as a loss-frame (e.g., “Failing to engage in regular exercise can leave you feeling lethargic and impair your physical health”) (Gerend, Shepherd, & Monday, 2008, p. 222). Research has indicated that gain-frame appeals are more effective when promoting a promotion-oriented mindset, and that loss-frame appeals are more effective when promoting a prevention-oriented mindset (Rothman, Bartels, Wlaschin, & Salovey, 2006).  Rothman and Salovey (1997) describe three rudimentary functions of health behaviors: Health behaviors may (1) prevent, (2) detect, or (3) cure/treat a health-related problem. Condom use, for example, can help to prevent health-related concerns, including unwanted pregnancy and STIs (Rothman & Salovey, 1997). Mammography, on the other hand, helps to detect whether an individual has a health problem, such as a potentially cancerous tumor (Rothman & Salovey, 1997). Finally, curing or treating a health problem may entail more extensive or invasive procedures, such as chemotherapy in order to combat cancer (Rothman & Salovey, 1997). Some health-related behaviors may meet criteria for more than one function. For example, physical exercise (e.g., running) may serve two functions simultaneously: prevention (e.g., heart disease) and treatment (e.g., obesity) (Berry & Carson, 2010). These categories serve as a framework for the primary functions of various health behaviors (Rothman & Salovey, 1997). Detection behaviors are often viewed as risky due to the chance that engaging in the 28   behavior may result in receiving unwanted or undesirable news (e.g., a mammography reveals the presence of a cancerous tumor) (Rothman & Salovey, 1997). Research has demonstrated that loss-framed messages are more effective in promoting detection behaviors (Detweiler, Bedell, Salovey, Pronin, & Rothman, 1999; Rothman & Salovey, 1997).  In contrast, the promotion of preventative behaviors is more often considered a relatively low risk and maintains one’s healthy state of being (e.g., apply sun screen to help prevent sun burns and skin cancer and maintain skin health) (Rothman & Salovey, 1997). Research reveals that gain-framed messages are more effective in the promotion of preventative health behaviors (Rothman, Salovey, Antone, Keough, Martin, 1993). Although there exist some discrepancies in the research, generally gain-framed messages are viewed as more effective regarding skin cancer prevention, smoking cessation, physical activity, and safe sex (Gallagher & Updegraff, 2012).   An exception to these rules of framing effects is demonstrated via the frequency with which a behavior is prescribed (Gerend, Shepherd, & Monday, 2008). Rothman and Salovey (1997) posit that a one-time preventative behavior, such as a vaccine, is perceived differently that a preventative behavior that requires multiple instances in which the individual engages in the behavior, such as applying facial sunscreen daily. Therefore, it is suggested that framing certain messages in terms of potential losses for not engaging in the advocated behavior may be more effective (Rothman & Salovey, 1997). A study conducted by Gerend and colleagues (2008) revealed that one-time or low frequency behaviors are more often associated with uncertainty compared to behaviors that necessitate repetition. For example, the loss-frame for a vaccine was no longer 29   effective when the behavior was described as entailing six shots rather than a single shot (Gerend et al., 2008).   Types of Framing Effects. In an in-depth analysis focused on framing research, Levin, Schneider, and Gaeith (1998) distinguish three primary types of framing, each distinct in their corresponding operational definition, results of decision-making processes, and their prospective underlying mechanisms. Levin and colleagues (1998) posited that an examination of the differences between these three types of framing would help distinguish possible isolating variables involved in individual differences in processing and responding to various message frames.   According to Levin, Schneider, and Gaeth (1998), the three primary types of valence framing include (1) risky choice framing, (2) attribute framing, and (3) goal framing. Risky choice framing refers to the basic tenants of choices set forth by Tversky and Kahneman (1981). Outcomes are presented in varying forms of risk, though they remain mathematically equivalent (e.g., The Asian Disease Problem as presented by Tversky and Kahneman, 1981). In attribute framing, the focus of framing is either an object or an event, and is seen as more favorable when presented in a positive light or less favorable when presented in a negative light (e.g., This brand of milk is 75% fat free versus This brand of milk contains 25% fat). The third type of framing, goal framing, involves the evaluation of an outcome (or goal) in a given message. In goal framing, the consequences of an action in a positive frame emphasize the subsequent benefits that occur following the performance of a specific behavior, whereas a negative frame emphasizes the negative consequences that occur following the non-performance of a specific behavior (e.g., emphasizing the benefits or advantages of conducting a breast 30   examination versus emphasizing the disadvantages of not conducting a breast examination in the evaluation of breast cancer). Levin and colleagues denote that individuals exposed to goal frames are more likely to perform a given behavior when presented with the negative consequences of not doing so, whereas individuals are less likely to perform a given behavior when presented with the positive consequences of performing the behavior (Levin, Schneider, & Gaeth, 1998). Thus, goal framing describes such situations in which a negative frame is more persuasive in promoting a certain behavior or endorsement than a positive frame of the same information.  A specific branch of goal framing is exhibited via loss and gain frames. Researchers have attempted to determine whether loss frames or gain frames are more effective in persuading an individual to either perform or not perform a given behavior. Research has found conflicting evidence. For example, regarding performing safe driving behaviors (e.g., wearing a seatbelt), researchers have found that message framing utilizing gain frames are more effective (e.g., Millar & Millar, 2000). Other researchers (i.e., Detweiler, Bedell, Salovey, Pronin, and Rothman, 1999) found that message framing utilizing gain frames are also more effective in persuading individuals to use sunscreen. Additionally, research shows that gain frames are more effective in regard to smoking cessation (Schneider, Salovey, Pallonen, Mundorf, Smith, Steward, 2001; Linville, Fischer, and Fischhoff, 1993). On the other hand, research has demonstrated that loss frames are more effective in influencing consumers to purchase certain brands (Gamliel & Herstein, 2007). Cherubini and colleagues (2005) revealed that loss frames were more effective in changing attitudes toward prostate screenings, and Ganzach and 31   Karsahi (1995) found that loss frames had a greater influence on changing frequency of credit card use, even up to six months after individuals received the message.   A review of message framing and behavioral health decisions conducted by Rothman and colleagues suggested that, overall, gain frames are more effective regarding prevention-oriented messages, whereas loss frames are more effective regarding detection-oriented messages (Rothman, Bartels, Wlaschin, & Salovey, 2006). However, there remains inconsistency among gain- and loss-framed research, resulting in some researchers adopting the task of conducting meta-analyses to add clarification to the research literature. For example, O’Keefe and Jensen (2006) performed a meta-analysis on 165 studies of message frames across various domains that included over 50,000 subjects. O’Keefe and Jensen found that their primary outcome variable, persuasion, had a mean effect size of 0.016 (95% confidence intervals, [-0.004, 0.035]), thus concluding that loss frame appeals were not more effective than gain-frame appeals.   Rothman and Salovey (1997), arguably the most predominant researchers in the field of message framing related to behavioral health decisions, found many studies whose results were inconsistent with what would be expected based on prospect theory. For example, Rotheman, Salovey, Antone, Keough, and Martin (1993) discovered that both gain and loss frames can result in endorsements of desired health behaviors. Perhaps this can be explained by the fact that some messages promote a behavior that is linked to some generalized probability of an unquantifiable outcome or involves an imperceptible risk (Mahoney, Buboltz, & Levin, 2011). For example, preventative behaviors such as using sunscreen, smoking cessation (Rothman, et al., 1993), or avoiding tanning beds may not be perceived as risky.  32   Rothman and Solvey (1997) argued that health behaviors can be explained as serving two primary functions: (1) a behavior can detect the development of health problems, and (2) a behavior can prevent the development of health problems. Thus, Rothman and Salovey distinguished two essential types of message frames crucial to the health domain: a detection frame and a prevention frame. Within this framework, a detective behavior is viewed as risk-seeking because it subjects one to the potential discovery of an illness, whereas a preventative behavior is viewed as risk-averse because it maintains the status quo of one’s health status. Thus, whether a particular health behavior is perceived as preventative or detective will, in turn, influence whether it is regarded as risk-seeking or risk-aversive (Rothman & Salovey, 1997). The individual’s perception will ultimately impact his or her decision-making processes, and ultimately their behavior. Thus, the degree of risk an individual perceives in reference to a particular choice is a critical component of message frames (Mahoney, Buboltz, & Levin, 2011).  Subsequent research conducted by Rothman, Salovey and colleagues (e.g., Rothman, Martino, Bedell, Detweiler, & Salovey, 1999) has integrated both risk-choice framing and goal framing in such a way as to demonstrate the social context in which gain and loss frames are posed influences one’s perception of the risk involved and, ultimately, the individual’s decision pertaining to health behaviors. Furthermore, Rothman and Salovey have postulated that there are three fundamental processes involved in deducing the impact a message frame may have on an individual. The first is that the message must be efficiently processed so that the individual may incorporate this information into his existing schema of the problem presented in the message. The second step involves the perception and acceptance of the message presented. The third 33   and final step claims that the message will prompt behavior only to the extent that the individual perceives the information as appropriate and sufficient. As demonstrated by Rothman and Salovey, risk perception is one of several mediating factors that influence the usefulness of message frames. Other mediating factors of individual differences involved in processing of decision-making that have been studied include gender, cognition, self-efficacy, and issue involvement (Mahoney, Buboltz, & Levin, 2011).  Message frames have infiltrated many aspects of daily life. Arguably, the majority of message frame research has involved the health domain (Mahoney, Buboltz, & Levin, 2011). Prevention-oriented messages emphasize either increasing or decreasing particular behaviors associated with the prevention of medical problems (Mahoney et al., 2011). Four primary outcomes that have been examined include (a) actual behavioral change, (b) intentions for behavior change, (c) change in attitudes pertaining to behavioral change, and (d) actual behavioral decisions. In relation to the health and safety domain, research has suggested that gain-frame messages tend to be more effective than loss-frame messages for increasing behavioral intentions (Millar & Millar, 2000). For example, Detweiler and colleagues (1999) found that gain-framed messages emphasizing the benefits of using sunscreen to prevent skin cancer were significantly more effective than loss-frame messages that emphasized the disadvantages to not using sunscreen. Research has indicated that gain-frame messages were also more effective in altering people’s cigarette and condom use (Schneider, Salovey, Pallonen, Monddorf, Smith, Steward, 2001; Linville, Fischer, and Fischoff, 1993). However, other studies have found loss-frames to be more effective in initiating behavioral change. For example, Cherubini, Rumiati, Rossi, Nigro, and Calabro (2005) found loss-frames to be more effective than 34   gain-frames regarding altering attitudes toward prostate screening. Additionally, loss-frames have also been found to be more effective in increasing individuals’ intentions to pursue regular dental screenings (Arora, 2000).  The benefits of using gain-framed messages over loss-framed messages in regard to certain behaviors have been investigated in order to better understand how to positively alter individuals’ behavioral intentions into actual behavioral changes. However, there are times and contexts in which health promotion endeavors may backfire. Related to the theory of psychological reactance, the boomerang effect has been found to occur when an individual engages in the opposite behavior than the one being advocated (Burgoon, Alvaro, Grandpre, & Voulodakis, 2002). Studies have demonstrated that, in some cases, when an individual perceives that his or her freedom is threatened or limited in some capacity, that individual is more likely to demonstrate reactance toward the message or advocated behavior and either ignore the message attempt altogether or even engage in the opposite behavior (Rains & Turner, 2007). Research conducted by Rains and Turner (2007) revealed that, in some cases, reactance increases as the magnitude of the advocated behavior increased, suggesting that larger requests may pose greater perceived threats to the individual’s freedom, whether in regard to one’s time, energy, or financial means. Such research implies that message designers strive to incorporate strategies that aim to induce positive emotions such as enthusiasm (Rains & Turner, 2007).  35   Individual Factors   Research has attempted to identify personal characteristics that may make certain individuals more or less susceptible to the effects of framing (Mahoney, Buboltz, Levin, Doverspike, & Svyantek, 2011). Thus, numerous individual factors have been examined in relation to message framing including personality dimensions (Lauriola, Russo, Fabio, Violani, & Levin, 2005; Levin, Gaeth, Schreiber, & Lauriola, 2002), self-efficacy (van’t Riet, Ruiter, Werrij, & de Vries, 2010; Werrij, Ruiter, Van’t Reit, & De Vries, 2010), need for cognition (Zhang & Buda, 2013), and source credibility (Jones, Sinclair, & Courneya, 2003).  Kuehberger (1997), for example, identified thinking-style and risk-style as two individual constructs that influence risky decision-making. Blais and Weber (2006) identified risk attitude as a variable that influences perceived risk. People differ in how they make decisions based on how they perceive risky or uncertain outcomes; such differences are conceptualized as fundamental differences in “risk attitude” (Blais & Weber, 2006, p. 33). Risk attitude is the boundary that differentiates between people’s varying styles of thinking or perceiving risk and uncertainty in decision-making. One prominent interpretation of risk attitude conceptualizes it as a personality trait (Blais & Weber, 2006; Weber, 1998). Moreover, it is now recognized that personality traits, traditionally defined as stable and enduring personality characteristics (Allport & Allport, 1921), may manifest differently depending on the context and situation.  Regulatory focus (Higgins, 2000) may also play a significant role in one’s perception of risk and thus influence decision-making. Regulatory focus theory posits that an individual’s regulatory focus, their standard view toward situations or events, 36   guides their processes of decision-making and behavior (Higgins, 2000). Accordingly, individuals can be classified into one of two chronic regulatory focus conditions: (a) promotion-focused or (b) prevention-focused (Latimer et al., 2008). Those who hold a promotion-focused view tend to perceive situations and events in terms of potential gains, whereas those who hold a prevention-focused view of the world tend to perceive situations and events in terms of potential losses (Spiegel, Grant-Pillow, & Higgins, 2004).  Promotion-focused individuals tend to think in terms of advancement, what they desire to accomplish, and who they aspire to become (Spiegel et al., 2004). These individuals are highly motivated and aim to achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams. For example, a promotion-focused individual may have a dream of opening her own bakery, so she learns what is needed and then moves to pursue this goal despite potential obstacles. Prevention-focused individuals tend to consider the potential losses associated with situations and decisions (Spiegel et al., 2004). Such individuals tend to concern themselves with minimizing potential negative outcomes and seek to fulfill their duties and responsibilities. For example, a prevention-focused individual may concern himself with ensuring or maintaining his financial security and safety by remaining at his current job, rather than seeking career advancement by the pursuit of a new job at a newly established company. However, while an individual may present a dominant or preferred regulatory focus, this does not mean that the two domains cannot coexist. An individual may hold both a promotion and prevention orientation simultaneously; the distinction is not always clear (Higgins, 2000). According to Higgins (2000), people experience regulatory 37   preference when their means of pursuing a goal matches their worldview. When decisions are congruent with one’s regulatory fit, individuals perceive their decisions as better and the individual is more likely to value this method of decision-making (Higgins, 2000). As a means of measuring regulatory focus, Higgins created the Regulatory Focus questionnaire (RFQ; Higgins, 1998) to identify and distinguish between prevention-focused and promotion-focused individuals. Subsequent research has demonstrated the efficacy of such a questionnaire. For example, Latimer and colleagues (2008) conducted a study that revealed, of those given a promotion-focused message encouraging physical activity, individuals categorized as promotion-focused actually outperformed their prevention-focused counterparts in physical activity.  However, research conducted by Pennington and Roese (2003) revealed that individuals’ regulatory focus may be susceptible to change over time. For instance, when goals are viewed at a distance, both temporally and spatially, individuals are more likely to endorse a promotion-focused message (Pennington & Roese, 2003). Research also indicates that various practices can be used to measure and induce regulatory focus (Kim, 2006). A study conducted by Kim (2006) revealed that priming at the onset of an efficacy appeal can induce regulatory focus. For example, adolescents randomly assigned to a promotion-primed condition versus a prevention-primed condition rated the promotion-focused message as more persuasive than that of the prevention-focused message (Kim, 2006). Nevertheless, regardless of whether one’s regulatory focus is chronic or induced, such information assists in determining whether an individual is more likely to seek beneficial behavioral changes or remain in their current situation (Liberman et al., 1999).  38   Psychological Reactance  Individual differences believed to influence one’s perception or interpretation of message frames emerge from various theories and research traditions (Mahoney, Buboltz, & Levin, 2011). Such theories and traditions include (1) the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) of persuasion, a dual process theory developed by Richard E. Petty and John Cacioppo (1986), (2) self-discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1987), (3) approach and avoidance motivation theories (Elliot, 1999), and (4) prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Across these various theories, researchers have studied a range of individual variables suspected of influencing or mediating the outcomes of message frames, including gender (Rothman, Salovey, Antone, Keough, & Martin, 1993), personality (Levin, Gaeth, Schreiber, & Lauriola, 2002), mood (Wegener, Petty, & Klein, 1994), self-regulation (Shah, Higgins, & Friedman, 1998), and information-processing (Meyers-Levy & Maheswaran, 2004).  Additionally, psychological reactance has been proposed as influencing an individual’s decision-making processes, specifically regarding the rejection of messages. Psychological reactance, or simply, reactance (Brehm, 1966; Brehm & Brehm, 1981), is the motivational force by which an individual strives to protect personal freedoms from either real or perceived threats (Brehm, 1966). Specifically, Brehm and Brehm (1981) define psychological reactance as “the motivational state that is hypothesized to occur when a freedom is eliminated or threatened with elimination” (Brehm & Brehm, 1981, p. 12). This force may be directed toward the restoration of the threatened freedom in a variety of ways, both cognitively and behaviorally (Thomas, Donnell, & Buboltz, 2001). Research conducted by Burgoon and colleagues (2002) suggests that individuals high in 39   psychological reactance may be less likely to change their attitudes or beliefs in response to persuasive message attempts.   The theory of psychological reactance (Brehm, 1966; Brehm & Brehm, 1981) provides a theoretical framework through which we may come to better understand decision-making processes after being exposed to persuasive attempts, both those that are successful and unsuccessful. Psychological reactance theory (Brehm, 1966; Brehm & Brehm, 1981) suggests that any persuasive message may provoke an individual incentive to reject what is being advocated (Dillard & Shen, 2005). In order to better understand why, we may conceptualize reactance as being comprised of four essential elements: (1) freedom, (2) threat to freedom, (3) reactance, and (4) restoration of freedom (Dillard & Shen, 2005). Brehm and Brehm (1981) note that evidence demonstrates that “threat to control or freedom has important psychological consequences, and these consequences may be either beneficial or harmful” to the individual.  Reactance theory is founded on the notion regarding the existence of free behaviors whereby it is assumed that, for any given person at any given moment, they have at their disposal the choice of a set of actions or behaviors in which they may engage (Brehm, 1966). This set of actions or behaviors is known as “free behaviors” (Brehm, 1966, p. 3). Moreover, in order for these sets of behaviors to be classified as free, the individual must possess the physical and psychological capability and awareness required to access and engage in them (Brehm, 1966). If an individual does not know that they can engage in a behavior, then the act, by definition, cannot be considered a free behavior. In addition, the arousal of reactance is also dependent on the individual’s belief that they have the ability to exercise the action. Without the belief that one can engage in 40   a behavior, it is by nature hypothetical, meaningless, and no freedom at all (Brehm & Brehm, 1981). Brehm further denotes that freedoms are not “abstract considerations, but concrete behavioral realities” (Brehm & Brehm, 1981, p. 12). Within the context of reactance theory, freedoms are conceptualized as both behavioral (i.e., what, when, where, how, or with whom one can or cannot do something) and psychological (i.e., opinions, beliefs, attitudes) (Brehm, 1966; Wong, Harrison, & Harvell, 2015).   Threats to freedom may be distinguished as those instances in which the individual experiences an event that “increases the perceived difficulty of having or of not having a potential outcome” to exercise his will (Brehm & Brehm, 1981, p. 3). Thus, the individual’s control over each possible option is threatened by the perceived loss of other possible options or a perceived increase in difficulty of attaining an outcome. When an individual has his or her freedom threatened, or perceives that his or her freedom is threatened, the individual becomes motivated to reclaim that freedom. The heightened emotional state whereby an individual attempts to regain the freedom is referred to as reactance (Brehm, 1966).   The process of restoration of freedom often involves behavioral action, whereby the individual engages in the forbidden act (Dillard & Shen, 2005). However, because freedoms are more dynamic and often involve psychological states, the act may be that of endorsing a thought, belief, attitude, idea, or opinion in attempt to go against the will of the oppressor. Moreover, restoring one’s sense of freedom may also occur indirectly via increasing one’s liking for a threatened choice (Brehm, Stires, Sensenig, & Shaban, 1966; Hammock & Brehm, 1966), deviating from source of threat (Kohn & Barnes, 1977), 41   denying that the threat exists (Worchel & Andreoli, 1974), or engaging in an alternative freedom in order to established a sense of choice and control (Wicklund, 1974).   Brehm (1981) initially argued that the nature of psychological reactance is hypothetical and, therefore, unable to be operationalized and measured (Dillard & Shen, 2005). Since this time, however, scholars have applied the ideas of reactance to various psychological studies on human behavior, and in the course of analyzing and extending the research in the area of reactance, have been able to define reactance in several ways. For instance, Petty and Cacioppo (1986) adopt a cognitive perspective in which reactance becomes measurable via self-report measures, such as the thought-listing technique (Cacioppo & Petty, 1981). A cognitive view of psychological reactance conceives the term as an act of counter-arguing (Dillard & Shen, 2005). Furthermore, other researchers conceptualize reactance as that of an emotional state in which certain cognitive appraisals result in the experience of anger (Dillard & Meijenders, 2002; Nabi, 2002). Dillard and Meijenders (2005) posit that, if indeed we can conceptualize reactance as an emotional construct, then perhaps we may also be able to measure reactance via self-report measures that allow one to measure the degree to which the individual experiences varying degrees of anger (e.g., irritation, annoyance, rage) in response to a perceived freedom threat. There is another mode of thought whereby reactance is conceptualized as a construct of both cognition and affect. This theory conceptualizes reactance as being a state in which cognitive and emotional influences are intertwined to such an extent that their distinct positions and individual influences may not be distinguishable (Dillard & Shen, 2005). Dillard and Shen posit that such an interpretation is compatible with the 42   view that motivation is an amalgam of its components, rather than a summation of its distinct parts.   Moreover, psychological reactance can function as both a state and a trait. State reactance refers to the motivational state one feels after a perceived threatened or eliminated freedom (Quick, Scott, Ledbetter, 2011). State reactance may vary depending on the magnitude of the perceived threat or how important the individual views the freedom being threatened (Quick et al., 2011). Although psychological reactance was initially conceived as being contingent upon one’s specific situation and context (Brehm, 1966; Wicklund, 1974), Brehm and Brehm (1981) acknowledged that individuals may vary in their inherent proneness toward reactance. Thus, individuals may exhibit inborn predispositions to behave in more reactive ways when they encounter perceived threats, and psychological reactance may be viewed as a trait. Brehm and Brehm (1981 as cited in Quick et al., 2011) proposed that trait reactance proneness might moderate the arousal of state reactance. In general, however, research indicates that subsequent to the exposure of a freedom-threatening message, state reactance is heightened (Quick et al., 2011). This state of emotional and cognitive arousal can serve as an essential variable in the persuasion process. Thus, it is important to consider the potential for state and trait reactance to predict a range of outcomes in persuasive health message attempts.  The notion that certain individuals display a tendency to experience state reactance more frequently than others prompted the conceptualization and development of numerous trait reactance scales (e.g., Dowd, Wallbrown, Sanders, & Yesenosky, 1994; Hong & Faedda, 1996; Shen & Dillard, 2005). Despite some disagreement over the measurement of trait reactance, the research on trait-based psychological reactance is 43   fairly consistent. Generally speaking, individuals high in trait-based reactance tend to value autonomy and independence (Brehm & Brehm, 1981). Because trait-based reactant individuals place such a high value on independence, they often attempt to resist influential attempts by others as a means of holding on to their sense of autonomy. When such an individual perceives his or her freedom as threatened, he or she is likely to restore that freedom, often by acting in opposition to the perceived threat (Brehm & Brehm, 1981).  Overall, individuals high in trait reactance are more likely than those low in trait reactance to experience state reactance upon the perception that a freedom is being provoked or eliminated. This is likely due to the trait reactant individual’s need for independence and autonomy, general combative and rebellious behavior, and a proclivity to oppose authority (Dowd, Wallbrown, Sanders, & Yesenosky, 1994; Seibel & Dowd, 2001; Shen & Dillard, 2005). Thus, individuals high in trait reactance are presumed to be more resistant to persuasive message attempts than those low in trait reactance (Quick et al., 2011).  Moreover, research indicates that trait-reactant individuals are also more likely than non-trait-reactant individuals to engage in risky behaviors (Miller et al., 2006). For example, a study conducted by Miller and colleagues (2006) revealed a positive correlation between tobacco use and trait reactance in a sample of junior high students. A study conducted by Miller and Quick (2010) revealed that individuals high in trait reactance were more likely than those low in trait reactance to use tobacco products and to engage in risky sexual behaviors. Based on such findings, Miller and colleagues advocated that trait-reactant individuals represent a target audience by which to aim 44   health campaign research (Miller et al., 2006; Miller & Quick, 2010). The desire for high trait-reactant individuals to maintain autonomy and independence can bolster their resistance to persuasive health messages (Quick et al., 2011), and it is important that research efforts aim to eliminate potential threats to reinforcing this reactance cycle in persuasive health message attempts.  In a study conducted by Dillard and Shen (2005), researchers found that, for data evaluating the nature and antecedents of reactance and its role in persuasive health communication, two different data sets yielded positive correlations between proneness to reactance and reactance. For both data sets evaluated, results indicated that cognition and affect mediated the effects of perceived threat to freedom and proneness to reactance on attitude, suggesting that cognitions and affect both influence a reactant state or trait. However, because one data set did not demonstrate a significant interaction between threat to freedom and proneness to reactance, researchers posited that the interaction between reactance proneness and perceived threat may be relevant for some topics but not for others. Results further indicated that reactance was strongest when both threat to freedom and proneness to reactance were high, while weakest when both threat to freedom and proneness to reactance were low. Based on results of their study, Dillard and Shen (2005) suggest that it is possible to measure reactance via a combination of self-report measures that assess both cognitive and emotional or affective states regarding perceived threats to freedom. Moreover, researchers argue that, because factor loadings for both cognitions and affect were comparable in magnitude, it may be inferred that each contributes equally to reactance or the motivation to restore the freedom that has been threatened.  45   Research conducted by Brehm and Brehm (1981) reveals that as a threatened freedom increases, state reactance increases. Quick and colleagues (2008) conducted a study in which they evaluated gain- and loss-frame messages in deterring binge drinking on college campuses. Results revealed that, for gain-frame messages, as an individual’s consumption of alcohol increased, so did the likelihood that the individual would resist persuasive messages that attempted to decrease the individual’s alcohol consumption (Quick, Bates, & Wang, 2008). Results of the study revealed that trait reactance predicted anger (β = 0.22) and explained a significant portion of the variance in perceived threat to freedom for the gain-frame message (β = 0.23) (Quick et al., 2008). For the loss-frame message, results revealed that trait reactance predicted anger (β = 0.25) and that the association between trait reactance on perceived threat to freedom approached significance (β = 0.14, p = 0.07) (Quick et al., 2008).  Evidence has supported the notion that individuals high in trait-reactance are more likely than those low in trait-reactance to experience state reactance upon perceiving their freedom as being threatened or eliminated (Miller et al., 2006; Quick & Stephenson, 2008). A study conducted by Quick and colleagues (2011) investigated trait reactance as a potential moderator of perceived threat to freedom after exposure to a persuasive health message. Specifically, researchers evaluated the effect of message features and trait reactance in the context of organ donation persuasive attempts (Quick et al., 2011). Results of the study indicated that, within the context of organ donation persuasive message attempts, freedom-threatening language and trait reactance are positively associated with perceived threat of freedom. Perceived threat of freedom, in turn, was positively associated with the state reactance (Quick et al., 2011).  46   Psychological reactance theory (PRT) has been used in health communication research as a means by which to better understand why many health campaigns are often unsuccessful (Quick et al., 2011). Research indicates that freedom-threatening language, including that which utilizes controlling (Dillard & Shen, 2005), dogmatic (Quick & Stephenson, 2008), and explicit (Burgoon et al., 2002) contributes to the perception that an individual’s freedom is being threatened or provoked and leads to state reactance (Brehm & Brehm, 1981). This research also highlights the ability of state reactance to predict a host of outcomes including message persuasiveness (Quick & Considine, 2008), attitudes (Dillard & Shen, 2005), motivations (Quick & Stephenson, 2008), behavioral intentions (Dillard & Shen, 2005), and actual behaviors (Bensley & Wu, 1991) (as cited in Quick et al., 2011).  Message Framing and Psychological Reactance. Wong and colleagues (2015) conducted a study to investigate the impact of message framing and psychological reactance on smokers’ responses to anti-smoking ads. Researchers aimed to determine the influences of psychological reactance involved in response to two separate messages often found in anti-smoking ads (i.e., secondhand smoke is dangerous to everyone; smoking is a highly addictive behavior correlated with many negative consequences). Wong and colleagues hypothesized that the type of message frame utilized would have an influence on the level of psychological reactance displayed by the smoker, and that specifically, loss frames would present a greater perceived threat, whereby which the individual would experience a greater degree of psychological reactance (Wong, Harrison, & Harvell, 2015). Researchers hypothesized that loss frame messages would engender a greater degree of reactance because such messages threaten an individual’s 47   freedom of choice, and indirectly inspire the illusion that the individual has no choice but to quit smoking or suffer undesirable consequences.  Conversely, researchers hypothesized that gain frames would engender less reactance because such messages present the individual with less of a perceived threat should the individual exert his or her choice to continue smoking (Wong et al., 2015). In the latter scenario, there is less of a perceived threat in that the individual may choose to continue smoking and is not presented with information that implies he or she will suffer negative consequences if the behavior in question persists (Wong et al., 2015). Results of the study conducted by Wong and colleagues (2015) indicated that smokers exposed to loss frame messages regarding smoking cessation demonstrated greater reactance than those exposed to gain frame messages and no messages at all, F(2, 142)=13.20, p<0.001, partial η2 =0.16. Specifically, results indicated that the smokers who received loss framed messages (M=3.29, SE=0.14) were significantly more reactant toward the message as compared to those who received gain frame messages (M=2.49, SE=0.15) and those who received neither (M=2.12, SE=0.21). Moreover, results also indicated that reactance mediated the relationship between loss frame message exposure and one’s intentions to quit smoking such that greater reactance was associated with lesser intentions to quit smoking. It is important to note that, at least in this specific study, loss frame messages were found to promote higher levels of reactance, which was related to lower levels of intention to quit smoking, thus counteracting the positive effect the ad intended in the first place. Wong and colleagues (2015) posit that, in attempts to get a population to engage in some desire activity or behavior, it is more effective to utilize gain frame 48   messages which result in lower levels of reactance with greater levels of intentionality for the desired behavior.    Furthermore, the strength or intensity of language used in persuasive message attempts has been shown to influence whether an individual will respond favorably toward the advocated message (Burgoon, Jones, & Steward, 1975; Miller, Lane, Deatrick, Young, & Potts, 2007; O’Keefe, 1997). A study conducted by Miller and colleagues (2007) evaluated the role of reactance in message rejection due to perceived threats to freedom when a message utilizes controlling language. Researchers manipulated degree of controlling language and verbal concreteness in persuasive health message attempts geared toward young adults (Miller et al., 2007). Results indicated that messages using controlling (versus autonomy supportive) language lead to significantly greater levels of anger, more negative assessments of perceived message fairness, and lower assessments of source sociability and trustworthiness (Miller et al., 2007). Additionally, messages that were conveyed using concrete (versus abstract) language resulted in more favorable attitudes toward the message topic, as well as greater behavioral intentions (Miller et al., 2007).   Advancing our understanding of potential factors that propel college students toward unhealthy lifestyles that may lead to health problems can help guide policy makers and health professionals in the direction of more effective health campaigns and programs. Instead of the college years being associated with the development of unhealthy habits, these years have the potential to become a foundation for healthy   49   behavioral changes, presenting new and unique opportunities for the development of healthy habits that ultimately result in both short- and long-term health benefits (Sander, 2012).  The Present Study   This study aims to examine the effects of message framing, regulatory focus, and psychological reactance, on motivating college students to take a more proactive approach in regard to their health and wellbeing. The present study incorporates many of the experimental aspects of the previously mentioned message-framing studies, yet this study is unique in that it examines two types of health-related behaviors considered areas related to health concerns for college students: alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors.   One goal of this study is to see if the way alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors are framed affects college students’ acceptance of the message, intention to perform the recommended behavior, and actual performance of the behavior. In addition, it is important to take into account factors, such as level of psychological reactance and regulatory focus, which may influence the likelihood that an individual will endorse an advocated behavior.  Hypothesis 1A The mean behavioral intentions for alcohol use between gain frames and loss frames will be significantly different such that individuals exposed to gain-framed messages will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use than to individuals exposed to loss-framed messages.  50   Hypothesis 1B The mean behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors between gain frames and loss frames will be significantly different such that individuals exposed to gain-framed messages will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors than individuals exposed to loss-framed messages.   Hypothesis 2A The mean behavioral intentions for alcohol use between promotion regulatory focus and prevention regulatory focus will be significantly different such that individuals with a promotion regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use than individuals with a prevention regulatory focus.  Hypothesis 2B  The mean behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors between promotion regulatory focus and prevention regulatory focus will be significantly different such that individuals with a promotion regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors than individuals with a prevention regulatory focus.  Justification for Hypotheses One and Two  Despite attempts to determine whether loss-framed or gain-framed messages are more effective in persuading individuals to engage in certain health-related behaviors, research has revealed conflicting evidence. In relation to the health and safety domain, research has suggested that gain-frame messages tend to be more effective than loss-frame messages for increasing behavioral intentions (Millar & Millar, 2000). Research has also indicated that participants presented with gain-framed messages report greater actual behavioral change (i.e., condom use) than those presented with the loss-framed 51   messages (e.g., Garcia-Retamero & Cokely). Research indicates that gain-frame messages tend to be more persuasive than that of loss-framed messages (Jones, Sinclair, & Courneya, 2003) regarding reducing alcohol consumption (Gerend & Cullen, 2008) and smoking cessation (Schneider et al., 2001b). A review of message framing and behavioral health decisions conducted by Rothman and colleagues (2006) suggested that, overall, gain-framed messages tend to be more effective regarding prevention-oriented messages, whereas loss frames are more effective regarding detection-oriented messages (Rothman, Bartels, Wlaschin, & Salovey, 2006).  Hypothesis 3A The mean behavioral intentions for alcohol use between high and low psychological reactance will be significantly different such that individuals with high psychological reactance will report significantly lower behavioral intentions for alcohol use than individuals with low psychological reactance.  Hypothesis 3B  The mean behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors between high and low psychological reactance will be significantly different such that individuals with high psychological reactance will report significantly lower behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors than individuals with low psychological reactance.  Justification for Hypothesis Three  The desire for high trait-reactant individuals to maintain autonomy and control and independence can bolster resistance to persuasive health messages (Quick et al., 2011). Research conducted by Burgoon and colleagues (2002) suggests that individuals high in psychological reactance may be less likely to change their attitudes or beliefs in 52   response to persuasive message attempts. Following exposure to a freedom-threatening message, state reactance is often heightened (Quick et al., 2011). Furthermore, research indicates that greater reactance is associated with lesser intentions to quit smoking (Wong et al., 2015).  Hypothesis 4A There is a significant interaction between message framing and regulatory focus on behavioral intentions for alcohol use such that individuals with a promotion regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use when exposed to a gain-framed message than individuals with a promotion regulatory focus exposed to a loss-framed message.  Hypothesis 4B  There is a significant interaction between message framing and regulatory focus on behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors such that individuals with a promotion regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors when exposed to a gain-framed message than individuals with a promotion regulatory focus exposed to a loss-framed message. Justification for Hypothesis Four  Research has emphasized and demonstrated the ability of reactance to predict a host of outcomes including behavioral intentions (Dillard & Shen, 2005) and actual behaviors (Bensley & Wu, 1991) (as cited in Quick et al., 2011). When an individual experiences reactance, they are likely to engage in means by which they can restore the freedom he perceives as being threatened (Brehm & Brehm, 1981). The process of restoration of freedom often involves behavioral action, whereby the individual engages 53   in the forbidden act (Dillard & Shen, 2005) or in an alternative freedom (e.g., the freedom being threatened) in order to established a sense of choice and control (Wicklund, 1974). Furthermore, previous research indicates that trait-reactant individuals are more likely than non-trait-reactant individuals to engage in risky behaviors (Miller et al., 2006; Miller & Quick, 2010).  Hypothesis 5A There is a significant interaction between message framing, regulatory focus, and psychological reactance on behavioral intentions for alcohol use such that, when exposed to a gain-framed message, individuals with low psychological reactance and a promotion-oriented regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use.  Hypothesis 5B There is a significant interaction between message framing, regulatory focus, and psychological reactance on behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors such that, when exposed to a gain-framed message, individuals with low psychological reactance and a promotion-oriented regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors. Justification for Hypothesis Five  Research suggests that individuals with a promotion-oriented regulatory focus tend to perceive situations and events in terms of potential gains, such as those emphasized via gain-framed messages, whereas those who hold a prevention-focused view of the world tend to perceive situations and events in terms of potential losses, such as those emphasized via loss-framed messages (Spiegel, Grant-Pillow, & Higgins, 2004). 54   Research has indicated that gain-frame appeals are more effective than loss-frame appeals when promoting promotion-oriented mindsets, (Rothman et al., 2006). Research further reveals that gain-framed messages are more effective in the promotion of preventative health behaviors (Rothman et al., 1993), such as those pertinent to the present study (i.e., drug and alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors).  Research also demonstrates that individuals with lower levels of psychological reactance are more likely to report higher levels of behavioral intention and demonstrate actual behavioral change when exposed to gain-framed messages than when exposed to loss-framed messages (Wong et al., 2015). This is likely due to the supposition that gain-framed messages engender less psychological reactance because such messages present the individual with less of a perceived threat should the individual exert his or her choice to continue engaging in the behavior being threatened (Wong et al., 2015). Furthermore, research reveals that individuals exposed to loss-framed messages demonstrate more reactance toward the advocated message compared to individuals who receive gain-frame messages. Loss-framed messages promote higher levels of reactance, which in turn is related to lower levels of behavioral intentions and behavioral change (Wong et al., 2015).  Based on such research, it has been advocated that, in attempts to get a population to engage in some desired activity or behavior, it is more effective to utilize gain-framed messages, which result in overall lower levels of reactance with greater levels of intentionality for the desired behavior (Quick et al., 2008).  55   Hypothesis 6   When exposed to a gain-framed message, individuals with low psychological reactance and a promotion-oriented regulatory focus will access the link provided the by researcher providing additional information regarding alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors significantly more than individuals with high psychological reactance and a prevention-oriented regulatory focus are exposed to a loss-framed message.     56 CHAPTER 2   Method    Participants  An a priori power analysis was conducted to determine the minimum sample size necessary in order to maximize power and minimize the probability of Type I and Type II errors for this study. Power analysis was conducted using G*Power software (Faul & Erdfelder, 1998) based on multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). For this analysis, power was set at 0.95 in order to maximize the probability of finding a significant effect if one exists within the specified population (Cohen, 1977). Bonferroni analysis was also conducted to account for the number of tests. G*Power analysis indicated that a minimum of 171 participants is required to find a 0.06 (medium) effect size.  Participants were recruited from undergraduate courses at Louisiana Tech University. Participants were at least 18 years of age. Efforts were made to recruit a balanced sample in regard to gender and racial/ethnic diversity. All participants were also directed to complete the survey outside of class time. Participants completed surveys in one of two possible formats: paper and pencil or online via Survey Monkey.  The average age of participants was 20.24 years, with a median age of 19.  Only undergraduates were eligible to participate in this study. The sample consisted of 33% 57   freshmen, 31% sophomores, 21% juniors, 12% seniors, and 3% fifth-year seniors. The majority of the sample identified as female (60%), compared to male (39%). The remaining participants identified as trans-spectrum (1%). This sample included White/Caucasian (75%), Black/African-American (14%), Hispanic/Latino (1.6%), Asian/ Asian American/ Pacific Islander (4%), and Middle Eastern/Arabic (1%) participants. The remaining 4.4% identified as other than those previously listed. The majority of participants identified as heterosexual (90%), while 10% identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or other. The mean and medians for the two independent variables were run to assess what an appropriate cut off score would be for high and low psychological reactance (M = 2.91, SD = 0.54), as well as prevention or promotion regulatory focus (M = 6.54, SD = 1.04). The median for psychological reactance was 3.00 and the median for regulatory focus was 6.56. The researcher then inspected the frequency table to see if 50% fell above or below these cut-off points. For psychological reactance, 49% of participants had a mean of 2.93 (155 participants) or lower, while 51% (158) had a mean total of 3.00 or higher; thus, the median was used as the cut point. For regulatory focus, 47% of participants had a mean of 6.5, while 53% had a mean of 6.55 or higher. Thus, the mean provided the cut point for prevention and promotion regulatory focus.  Upon receiving informed consent of those willing to participate in the study, in order to control for internal validity, individuals were randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) those exposed to a gain-framed message regarding alcohol use and a gain-framed message regarding risky sexual behavior, (2) those exposed to a gain-framed message regarding alcohol use and a loss-framed message regarding risky sexual 58   behavior, (3) those exposed to a loss-framed message regarding alcohol use and a loss-framed message regarding risky sexual behaviors, and (4) those exposed to a loss-framed message regarding alcohol use and a gain-framed message regarding risky sexual behaviors.   Design   The present study employs a between-subjects quasi-experimental design.  The independent variables are message frame, psychological reactance, and regulatory focus. The dependent variables are behavioral intentions and actual behaviors for alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors.   Measures    Demographic and education questions were included as a tool for assessing the demographic data of the sample. The demographics questionnaire consisted of general questions regarding the participants’ age, race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, academic rank, sexual orientation, and relationship status (see Appendix B).   Drug and alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors information consisted of both gain-framed and loss-framed health information messages presented in a traditional paper-pencil format. Gain-frames and loss-frames were manipulated by wording outcomes in terms of potential gains and losses. Both the gain- and loss-framed messages attended to information related to drug and alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors among college students. Each presentation included risk factors, recommended behaviors, the importance of adherence, and facts about drug and alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors (See Appendix C for frames).  59    The General Regulatory Focus Measure (GRFM; Lockwood, Jordan, & Kunda, 2002) is an 18-item scale that measures individuals’ orientation toward their personal goals. The determination between regulatory types is determined by which of two possible end-states is employed in the individual’s goal regulation. Comprised of two primary subscales, the GRFM distinguishes an individual’s orientation as either promotion- or prevention-focused. Each subscale consists of nine items. The promotion subscale consists of items: 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 18. The prevention subscale consists of items: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 15. The GRFM uses a Likert type response scale ranging from “1” (not at all true of me) to “9” (very true of me). Scores on the two subscales are combined to generate a single index of motivational orientation by subtracting the prevention mean from the promotion mean. Higher scores on either subscale indicate individuals’ current attitudes in regard to goal attainment. Promotion focus is defined as regulation fixed on the positive reference point of a “gain” (i.e., a goal to achieve a desirable end-state and avoid the absence of this state), whereas prevention focus is defined as regulation fixed on the negative reference point of a “loss” (i.e., a goal to avoid an undesirable end-state and achieve an absence of this state). A promotion goal is attained when the current state is congruent with that of the desired state of a gain. A prevention goal is attained when a state of non-loss has been reached. Both the promotion (α = 0.81) and prevention (α = 0.75) subscales demonstrate good internal reliability (Lockwood et al., 2002). Appendix D provides both subscales.   Hong’s Psychological Reactance Scale (HPRS; Hong & Fredda, 1996) is a 14-item questionnaire designed to measure individual differences in proneness to reactance, that is, an individual’s trait proclivity to experience psychological reactance 60   (Shen & Dillard, 2005). Reliability was estimated for the total score (α = 0.77; Hong & Fredda, 1996). A more recent study conducted by Shen and Dillard (2005) indicated that the reliabilities for the total score across three samples were 0.75, 0.80, and 0.79. Hong’s Psychological Reactance Scale is provided in Appendix E.   Behavioral intentions consisted of a single item that measures participants’ likelihood to adhere to healthy levels of alcohol consumption and sexual behavior recommendations. Consistent with procedures employed by Rothman and colleagues (1992), participants indicated responses on a 9-point Likert scale, ranging from “1” (extremely unlikely) to “9” (extremely likely) (See Appendix F).   Actual behavioral outcome measured whether the participant demonstrated marked interest in attaining further information regarding alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors. Participants’ behavioral outcomes were measured in the form of a dichotomous variable based on whether the participant attempted to gain more information related to the health messages. Whether participants attempted to gain more information was assessed based on whether they visited a designated website that provided additional information and whether they attended a follow-up seminar. Participants were presented with a link at the end of the survey, providing access to a secondary survey containing relevant health information pertaining to alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors. Information included in the online follow-up served to inform participants of additional benefits of engaging in healthy alcohol consumption and sexual behaviors, tips for healthy sexual practices, further recommendations and resources, and goal-setting techniques. Each participant was given a unique code, which they were required to submit in order to access the website. This allowed the researcher to measure 61   actual behaviors by tracking which individuals pursued further information related to the health messages upon completion of the survey. In addition to the link provided for access to further health information related to alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, participants were thanked in writing for their participation in the study (See Appendix G).   Procedure    Upon receiving IRB approval, participants were recruited from undergraduate courses at Louisiana Tech University. Participants were provided with a brief overview of the study prior to being presented with a consent form for review. Participants who agreed to participate did so by signing the consent form for the experiment, verifying that they understood the study as well as potential risks and benefits. The consent form clarified that all participation was voluntary and that all survey responses remain confidential. Once the consent form was signed, the study was briefly summarized, and included information such that the experiment would consist of several questionnaires estimated to take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants were also given brief instructions and asked if they had any questions regarding the study.  Once all questions were answered, participants were given the survey packet materials containing a demographic questionnaire, the General Regulatory Focus Measure (GRFM), Hong’s Psychological Reactance Scale (HPRS), a measure of behavioral intentions, and a thank you and seminar reminder, including a link to a website providing further alcohol use and risky sexual behavior information. All participants received two individual messages, one concerning drug and alcohol use and one concerning risky sexual behaviors. Individuals received one of four possible packets, randomly distributed. The packets included those with (1) a gain-frame message for 62   alcohol use and a gain-framed message for risky sexual behaviors, (2) a gain-frame message for alcohol use and a loss-frame message for risky sexual behaviors, (3) a loss-framed message for alcohol use and a loss-framed message for risky sexual behaviors, or (4) a loss-framed message for alcohol use and a gain-framed message for risky sexual behaviors.  Messages consisted of health information related to the importance of developing and maintaining safe and healthy behaviors related to drug and alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, as well as the potential negative consequences of not doing so. (See Appendix C). Following these messages, participants’ intentions to perform recommended health behaviors were assessed via a 9-point Likert scale ranging from “1” (extremely unlikely) to “9” (extremely likely) (See Appendix F). Lastly, participants’ actual behaviors were assessed by evaluating whether participants attempted access to a website containing further health information pertaining to alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors. Participants were presented with an opportunity to attain further information regarding alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors following the completion of all questionnaires. Participants were provided with an online link to a site that contains information regarding these health concerns. Participants were asked to enter a unique user number in order to access this information. This allowed the researcher to monitor whether participants sought to gain further information regarding alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors (See Appendix G).   Data Analysis   Once data collection was complete, the data was cleaned, missing data was addressed appropriately, and preliminary analyses were conducted. Frequency and 63   percentages were calculated for demographic variables. Means, standard deviations, ranges, and reliabilities for variables in the study were also calculated. Data were inspected for skewness, kurtosis, outliers, and other potential problems. Data were examined in terms of two primary dependent variables: intention to perform behavior and actual behavior. Separate Factorial Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) were conducted. The first evaluated mean differences between three independent variables (message frame, psychological reactance, and regulatory focus) and individuals’ patterns of response regarding the dependent variable, intention to perform health behaviors for alcohol use. The second evaluated mean differences between the three independent variables and individuals’ patterns of response regarding the dependent variable, risky sexual behaviors. The third ANOVA evaluated mean differences between the three independent variables and individuals’ actual behavior (e.g., frequency of access to link provided by researcher providing additional information) for alcohol use. The fourth evaluated mean difference between the three independent variables and individuals’ actual behavior (e.g., frequency of access to link provided by researcher providing additional information) for risky sexual behaviors. Thus, participants received two separate health messages, one message pertaining to alcohol use (either gain-frame or loss-frame) and one message pertaining to risky sexual behaviors (either gain-frame or loss-frame). For hypotheses related to behavioral intentions (behavioral intentions for alcohol use and behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors), separate Factorial ANOVAs were conducted. Design  A quasi-experimental design was used. A 2x2x2 factorial ANOVA was conducted and the researcher examined the main effect of message framing on behavioral intentions 64   for alcohol use. The independent variable was message frame with two levels, gain and loss. The dependent variable was behavioral intentions for alcohol use.  A 2x2x2 factorial ANOVA was conducted and the researcher examined the main effect of message framing on behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors. The independent variable was message frame with two levels, gain and loss. The dependent variable was behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors.  Hypothesis 1   H1A: The mean behavioral intentions for alcohol use between gain frames and loss frames will be significantly different such that individuals exposed to gain-framed messages will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use than to individuals exposed to loss-framed messages.  H1B: The mean behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors between gain frames and loss frames will be significantly different such that individuals exposed to gain-framed messages will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors than individuals exposed to loss-framed messages.   Hypothesis 2   H2A: The mean behavioral intentions for alcohol use between promotion regulatory focus and prevention regulatory focus will be significantly different such that individuals with a promotion regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use than individuals with a prevention regulatory focus.  H2B: The mean behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors between promotion regulatory focus and prevention regulatory focus will be significantly different such that individuals with a promotion regulatory focus will report significantly greater 65   behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors than individuals with a prevention regulatory focus.  Hypothesis 3  H3A: The mean behavioral intentions for alcohol use between high and low psychological reactance will be significantly different such that individuals with high psychological reactance will report significantly lower behavioral intentions for alcohol use than individuals with low psychological reactance.  H3B:  The mean behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors between high and low psychological reactance will be significantly different such that individuals with high psychological reactance will report significantly lower behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors than individuals with low psychological reactance.  Hypothesis 4  H4A: There is a significant interaction between message framing and regulatory focus on behavioral intentions for alcohol use such that individuals with a promotion regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use when exposed to a gain-framed message than individuals with a promotion regulatory focus exposed to a loss-framed message.  H4B: There is a significant interaction between message framing and regulatory focus on behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors such that individuals with a promotion regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors when exposed to a gain-framed message than individuals with a promotion regulatory focus exposed to a loss-framed message. 66   Hypothesis 5  H5A: There is a significant interaction between message framing, regulatory focus, and psychological reactance on behavioral intentions for alcohol use such that, when exposed to a gain-framed message, individuals with low psychological reactance and a promotion-oriented regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use.  H5B: There is a significant interaction between message framing, regulatory focus, and psychological reactance on behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors such that, when exposed to a gain-framed message, individuals with low psychological reactance and a promotion-oriented regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors. Hypothesis 6    When exposed to a gain-framed message, individuals with low psychological reactance and a promotion-oriented regulatory focus will access the link provided the by researcher providing additional information regarding alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors significantly more than individuals with high psychological reactance and a prevention-oriented regulatory focus are exposed to a loss-framed message.     67  CHAPTER 3   RESULTS   Participants were recruited from 10 psychology course sections, resulting in 318 individuals volunteering to participate in either an online survey via Survey Monkey or paper-and-pencil format, both of which were completed outside of class time. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions (i.e., Gain/ Gain messages, Gain/ Loss messages, Loss/ Gain messages, or Loss/ Loss messages). Of the individuals consenting to participate, two participants failed to complete the entire survey and were excluded. Altogether, 316 participants completed all parts of the study.  After excluding the data of those who failed to complete all parts of the study, the final sample size for this study was 316, which satisfied the a priori power analysis which indicated that a minimum of 171 participants were needed to detect moderate effect sizes (f = 0.25) with 95% power (α = 0.05).  From the final sample size of 316 participants, 25 participants would be randomized to fit in one of eight cells for a 2x2x2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) for both alcohol use and risky sexual behavioral intentions.  Because data were collected cross-sectionally rather than paired, the appropriate analyses are a between-subjects ANOVA and a MANOVA as initially intended. There were multiple homogeneity of variance violations, which forced the researcher to use multiple factorial ANOVAs in order to preserve statistical power (Yockey, 2011). There68    were not enough participants that accessed the website to perform the appropriate factorial ANOVA to assess actual behaviors. The researcher, instead, used a weighted chi-square test of independence. Tables 1 and 2 show descriptive statistics for risky alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors. Tables 3 and 4 show descriptive statistics for race, sex, and sexual orientation for alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors. Tables 5 and 6 show ANOVA demographic information for alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors.

The independent variables were message framing with two levels (gain and loss; Hypothesis 1A); psychological reactance, with two levels (high and low; Hypothesis 3A); and regulatory focus, with two levels (prevention and promotion; Hypothesis 5A). The dependent variable was self-rated behavioral intention to reduce risky alcohol use. A preliminary exploratory analysis was conducted to assess whether the assumptions of a factorial 73    ANOVA were met. The first assumption tested was normality. Skewness was -0.47 and kurtosis was -0.85 for gain-framed alcohol use messages and -0.67 and -0.75, respectively, for loss-framed alcohol use messages. The histogram for the gain frame group was normally distributed, while the histogram for the loss frame group was negatively skewed and not normally distributed. The data points within the Q-Q plot demonstrated a cluster pattern along the line for both gain- and loss-framed messages. The Detrended Normal Q-Q Plot of Standardized Residuals displayed a zig-zag pattern, but was more dispersed than the idealized pattern. Additionally, while the box-and-whisker plots for gain-framed messages were normally distributed, the plot for loss-framed messages was negatively skewed. Normality was also assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. Results indicated that the test was statistically significant for gain frames, p < 0.001, and loss frames, p < 0.001, indicating that the data were not normally distributed. Although the results of the tests for normality were mixed, because the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was significant, the researcher determined the assumption of normality was not met. Because ANOVA is robust against violations of the assumption of normality (David & Johnson, 1951; Horsnell, 1953; Reineke, Baggett, & Elfessi, 2003), the researcher continued with data analysis. Although not an assumption of a factorial ANOVA, descriptive statistics for the standardized scores of both the dependent variable in each of the groups were assessed to check for outliers. Because none of the minimum or maximum standardized scores exceeded a z score of 3.29, it was concluded that there were no univariate outliers present (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013).  74    When evaluating psychological reactance, skewness was -0.95 and kurtosis was 0.09 for low psychological reactance and -0.20 and -1.19 for high psychological reactance. The histogram for low psychological reactance was negatively distributed, while the histogram for high psychological reactance was normally distributed. The data points within the Q-Q plot demonstrated a cluster pattern along the line for both low and high psychological reactance. The Detrended Normal Q-Q Plot of Standardized Residuals displayed a zig-zag pattern, but was more dispersed than the idealized pattern Additionally, while the box-and-whisker plots for low psychological reactance were negatively skewed, the plot for high psychological reactance was normally distributed. Normality was also assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. Results indicated that the test was statistically significant for low, p < 0.001, and high, p < 0.001, psychological reactance, indicating that the data were not normally distributed. Although the results of the tests for normality were mixed, because the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was significant, the researcher determined the assumption of normality was not met.

Because none of the minimum or maximum standardized scores exceeded a z score of 3.29, it was concluded that there were no univariate outliers present (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013).  When evaluating regulatory focus, skewness was -0.45 and kurtosis was -1.06 for prevention regulatory focus and -0.67 and -0.55 for promotion regulatory focus. The 75    histograms for both prevention and promotion regulatory focus were negatively distributed. The data points within the Q-Q plot demonstrated a cluster pattern along the line for both prevention and promotion regulatory focus. The Detrended Normal Q-Q Plot of Standardized Residuals displayed a zig-zag pattern, but was more dispersed than the idealized pattern. Additionally, while the box-and-whisker plot for promotion regulatory focus was negatively skewed, the plot for prevention regulatory focus was normally distributed. Normality was also assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. Results indicated that the test was statistically significant for both promotion, p < 0.001, and prevention, p < 0.001, regulatory focus, indicating that the data were not normally distributed.

Although not an assumption of a factorial ANOVA, descriptive statistics for the standardized scores of both the dependent variable in each of the groups were assessed to check for outliers. None of the minimum or maximum scores exceeded a standardized z score of 3.29 so the researcher concluded that no univariate outliers were present (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013).  Preliminary Analysis Three one-way ANOVAS were conducted on demographic variables. The first ANOVA was conducted to test if there was a significant mean difference by participants’ gender on alcohol behavioral intentions. The independent variable was sex with three 76    levels: male, female, and trans spectrum. The dependent variable was self-rated alcohol use behavioral intentions. To control for Type I errors, the alpha level was adjusted for the three ANOVAs (α/3 = 0.017). Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance was not significant F(2, 299) = 1.93, p = 0.15, indicating that the variances between groups were the same. The results indicated that there was no significant mean difference for sex, F(2, 299) = 1.42, p = 0.24.  The second ANOVA was conducted to test if there was a significant mean difference by participants’ race on alcohol behavioral intentions. The independent variable was race with eight levels: Arabic/Middle Eastern, Asian/Asian American/Pacific Islander, Biracial, Black/African- American, Hispanic/Latino/a, Native American/American Indian, White/Anglo or European- American, and Other. The dependent variable was self-rated alcohol use behavioral intentions. To control for Type I errors, the alpha level was adjusted for the three ANOVAs (α/3 = 0.017). Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance was not significant F(7, 294) = 1.04, p = 0.40, indicating that the variances between groups were the same. The results indicated that there was no significant mean difference by race, F(2, 294) = 0.75, p = 0.63.  The third ANOVA was conducted to test if there was a significant mean difference in participant’s sexual orientation on alcohol behavioral intentions. The independent variable was sexual orientation with eight levels: bisexual, heterosexual, homosexual, and pansexual. The dependent variable was self-rated alcohol use behavioral intentions. To control for Type I error, for the three ANOVAs, the alpha level was adjusted (α/3 = 0.017). Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance was significant F(3, 297) = 2.73, p = 0.04, meaning the variances between the groups were not the same. The 77    results indicated that there was no significant mean difference for sexual orientation, F(2, 297= 2.31, p = 0.08.

Consequently, the researcher randomly selected an equal number of participants from each cell for data analysis (Keppel, 1991).  A 2x2x2 analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test if there was an interaction between message framing (gain frames vs. loss frames), regulatory focus (promotion vs. prevention), and psychological reactance (high vs. low) on alcohol use behavioral intentions (See Table 10). The first independent variable was message framing, with two levels: gain frames and loss frames. The second independent variable was regulatory focus, with two levels: promotion and prevention. The third independent variable was psychological reactance, with two levels: high and low. The dependent variable was self-rated alcohol use behavioral intentions. To control for Type I Error, the alpha level was adjusted for the three groups being analyzed (α/3 = 0.017). Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance was significant F(7, 198) = 2.79, p  = 0.009, indicating that the variances between groups were not the same. However, according to Shingala and 79    Rajyaguru (2015), the use of Games-Howell interpretation for comparison between groups should be used to determine any significant mean differences should they occur. The results indicated a significant main effect for psychological reactance (Hypothesis 2A), F(1, 198) = 11.02, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.053. Bonferroni corrected comparisons revealed those with low psychological reactance (M = 6.69, SE = 0.24) reported significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use than those with high psychological reactance (M = 5.55, SE = 0.24). There was no significant main effect for regulatory focus (Hypothesis 3A), F(1, 198) = 0.101, p = 0.75 or message framing (Hypothesis 1A), F(1, 198) = 1.76, p = 0.19. There was no significant interaction between psychological reactance, regulatory focus, and message framing (Hypothesis 5) F(1, 198) = 2.54, p = .11. Additionally, individuals with low psychological reactance reported higher scores on behavioral intentions for alcohol use than those with high psychological reactance, d = 0.45.

The independent variables were message framing, with two levels: gain and loss (Hypothesis 1B), psychological reactance with two levels: high and low (Hypothesis 3B), and regulatory focus, with two levels: prevention and promotion (Hypothesis 5B). The dependent variable was self-rated behavioral intentions to reduce risky sexual behaviors. Preliminary exploratory analysis was conducted to assess whether the assumptions for a factorial ANOVA were met. The first assumption tested was normality. Skewness was -1.61 and kurtosis was 1.88 for gain-framed messages and -1.08 and -0.33 for loss-framed messages. Histograms for the gain- and loss-framed groups were negatively skewed. The data points within the Q-Q plot demonstrated a cluster pattern along the line for loss-framed messages, but not for gain-framed messages. The Detrended Normal Q-Q Plot of Standardized Residuals displayed a zig-zag pattern, but was more dispersed than an idealized pattern. Additionally, the box-and-whisker plots for gain-and loss-framed messages were negatively skewed. Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. Results indicated that the test was statistically significant for gain, p < 0.001, and loss-framed, p < 0.001, messages, indicating that the data were not normally distributed. Although the results of the tests for normality were mixed, because the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was significant, the researcher determined the assumption of normality was not met. Because ANOVAs are robust against violations of the 81    assumption of normality (David & Johnson, 1951; Horsnell, 1953; Reineke, Baggett, & Elfessi, 2003), the researcher continued with data analysis. Although not an assumption of a factorial ANOVA, descriptive statistics for the standardized scores of the dependent variables in each group were assessed to check for outliers. Because none of the minimum or maximum standardized scores exceeded a z score of 3.29, it was concluded that there were no univariate outliers present (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013).  Skewness was -1.63 and kurtosis was 2.64 for low psychological reactance and -0.98 and -0.05, respectively, for high psychological reactance. The histogram for high and low psychological reactance was negatively skewed. The data points within the Q-Q plot did not cluster along the line for low psychological reactance, but did for high psychological reactance. The Detrended Normal Q-Q Plot of Standardized Residuals displayed a zig-zag pattern, but was more dispersed than an idealized pattern. Additionally, the box-and-whisker plots for low and high psychological reactance were negatively skewed. Normality was also assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results indicated that the test was statistically significant for low, p < 0.001, and high, p <0.001, psychological reactance, indicating that the data were not normally distributed. Although the results of the tests for normality were mixed, because the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was significant, the researcher determined the assumption of normality was not met. Because ANOVA is robust against violations of the assumption of normality (David & Johnson, 1951; Horsnell, 1953; Reineke, Baggett, & Elfessi, 2003), the researcher continued with the data analysis. Although not an assumption of a factorial ANOVA, descriptive statistics for the standardized scores of both the dependent variable in each of the groups were assessed to check for outliers. Because none of the minimum 82    or maximum standardized scores exceeded a z score of 3.29, it was concluded that there were no univariate outliers present (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013).  Skewness was -1.00 and kurtosis was 0.30 for prevention regulatory focus and -1.64 and 1.97 for promotion regulatory focus. The histogram for both prevention regulatory focus and promotion regulatory focus were negatively distributed. The data points within the Q-Q plot demonstrated a cluster pattern along the line for both prevention regulatory focus and promotion regulatory focus. The Detrended Normal Q-Q Plot of Standardized Residuals displayed a zig-zag pattern, but was more dispersed than an idealized pattern. Additionally, while the box-and-whisker plot for promotion regulatory focus was negatively skewed, the plot for prevention regulatory focus was normally distributed. Normality was also assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The test was statistically significant for promotion, p < 0.001, and prevention regulatory focus, p < 0.001, indicating that the data were not normally distributed. Although the results of the tests for normality were mixed, because the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was significant, the researcher determined the assumption of normality was not met.

Because none of the minimum or maximum standardized scores exceeded a z score of 3.29, it was concluded that there were no univariate outliers present (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013).  83    Preliminary Analysis Three one-way ANOVAS were conducted on demographic variables. The first ANOVA was conducted to test if there was a significant mean difference by participants’ sex on risky sexual behavioral intentions. The independent variable was sex, with three levels: male, female, or trans spectrum. The dependent variable was self-rated risky sexual behavioral intentions. To control for Type I error, the alpha level was adjusted for three ANOVAs (α/3 = 0.017). Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance was significant F(2, 296) = 5.59, p = 0.004, suggesting the variances between the groups were not equal. Results indicated that there were no significant mean differences for risky sexual behaviors, F(2, 296) = 3.73, p = 0.03. The second ANOVA was conducted to test if there was a significant mean difference by participants’ race on risky sexual behavioral intentions. The independent variable was race with eight levels: Arabic/Middle Eastern, Asian/Asian American/Pacific Islander, Biracial, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino/a, Native American/American Indian, White/European American, or Other. The dependent variable was self-rated risky sexual behavioral intentions. To control for Type I error, the alpha level was adjusted for the three ANOVAs (α/3 = 0.017). Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance was significant F(7, 291) = 3.40, p = 0.002, suggesting the variances between the groups were not the same. The results indicated that there were no significant mean differences for race, F(7, 291) = 0.75, p = 0.13. The third ANOVA was conducted to test if there was a significant mean difference by participants’ sexual orientation on risky sexual behavioral intentions. The independent variable was sexual orientation, with four levels: bisexual, heterosexual, 84    homosexual, and pansexual. The dependent variable was self-rated risky sexual behavioral intentions. To control for Type I error for the three ANOVAs, the alpha level was adjusted (α/3 = 0.017). Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance was not significant F(3, 295) = 0.99, p = 0.40, suggesting the variances between the groups were the same. The results indicated that there were no significant mean differences for sexual orientation, F(3, 295) = 0.22, p = 0.88. Main Analysis Factorial ANOVAs are sensitive to unequal cell sizes and the cell sizes in this sample were uneven. Consequently, the researcher randomly selected an equal number of participants from each cell for data analysis (Keppel, 1991).  Due to low cell size in one cell of participants (i.e., those exposed to gain-framed messages with prevention regulatory focus and low in psychological reactance), three separate 2x2 ANOVAs were conducted. The analysis was then carried out with four groups of 60 randomly selected participants. This was done three separate times for the three separate 2x2 ANOVAs (Hypothesis 5).  Because there existed multiple homogeneity of variance violations, the researcher used multiple factorial ANOVAs in order to preserve statistical power (Yockey, 2011). Because there were insufficient participants (n = 9) that accessed the link provided by the researcher, a factorial ANOVA could not be conducted to assess actual behaviors. The researcher, instead, used a weighted chi-square test of independence to measure actual behaviors (Hypothesis 6).  85    Regulatory Focus by Psychological Reactance The first 2x2 ANOVA that was conducted included psychological reactance (high vs. low) and regulatory focus (promotion vs. prevention) and as the independent variables. The dependent variable was self-rated risky sexual behavioral intentions. To control for Type I errors in the two simple main effects analyses, the alpha level was adjusted for the three groups analyzed (α/6 = 0.008). Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance was significant F(3, 214) = 4.31, p  = 0.006, suggesting that the variances between the groups were not the same. However, according to Shingala and Rajyaguru (2015), the Games-Howell interpretation for comparison between groups should be used in order to determine the presence of significant means. The results indicated that there was a significant main effect for psychological reactance, F(1, 240) = 10.56, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.042. Bonferroni corrected comparisons revealed those with low psychological reactance (M = 7.60, SE = 0.20) reported significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behavioral intentions than those with high psychological reactance (M = 6.67, SE = 0.21, d = 0.41). There was no significant main effect for regulatory focus, F(1, 240) = 1.35, p = 0.25. There was no significant interaction between psychological reactance and regulatory focus F(1, 240) = 0.17, p = 0.68.

The dependent variable was self-rated risky sexual behavioral intentions. To control for Type I errors for two simple main effects analyses, the alpha level was adjusted for the four groups being analyzed (α/4 = 0.008). Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance was significant F(3, 212) = 8.69, p  < 0.001, suggesting that the variances between the groups were not the same. However, according to Shingala and Rajyaguru (2015), the Games-Howell interpretation for comparison between groups should be used in order to determine the presence of significant means. There was no significant main effect for regulatory focus, F(1, 214) = 2.54, p = 0.11. There was no significant main effect for message framing (Hypothesis 1B), F(1, 214) = 0.11, p = 0.12.

There was a significant main effect for psychological reactance, F(1, 238) = 11.45, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.047. Bonferroni corrected 89    comparisons revealed those with low psychological reactance (M = 7.65, SE = 0.21) reported significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors than those with high psychological reactance (M = 6.65, SE = 0.20).

The results are as follows.  A 2x2 ANOVA was conducted including regulatory focus (promotion vs. prevention) and message framing (gain vs. loss) for individuals low in psychological reactance. The dependent variable was self-rated risky sexual behavioral intentions. To control for Type I error for four simple main effects analyses, the alpha level was adjusted for the two groups being analyzed (α/2 = 0.008). Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance was significant, F(3, 146) = 3.64, p  = 0.014, suggesting that the variances between the groups were not the same. However, according to Shingala and Rajyaguru (2015), the Games-Howell interpretation for comparison between groups should be used in order to determine the presence of significant means. There was no significant main effect for regulatory focus, F(1, 146) = 2.54, p = 0.11. There was no significant main effect for message framing, F(1, 146) = .11, p = 0.12. There was a significant interaction F(1, 146) = 8.74, p = 0.004, η2 = 0.056. Bonferroni corrected comparisons revealed that individuals with low psychological reactance, prevention-oriented regulatory focus, 91    exposed to gain-framed messages (M = 8.11, SE = 0.41) as well as individuals with low psychological reactance, promotion-oriented regulatory focus, exposed to loss-framed messages (M = 8.12, SE = 0.25) reported significantly greater risky sexual behavioral intentions than individuals with low psychological reactance, promotion-oriented regulatory focus, exposed to gain-framed messages (M = 7.34, SE = 0.28) or individuals with low psychological reactance, prevention-oriented regulatory focus, exposed to loss-framed messages (M = 7.03, SE = 0.29).

The dependent variable was self-rated risky sexual behavioral intentions. To control for Type I error for four simple main effects analyses, the alpha level was adjusted for the three groups being analyzed (α/2 = 0.008). Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance was not significant F(3, 146) = 0.49, p  = 0.69, suggesting that the variances between the groups were the same.

Estimated Marginal Means of Intention RSB   95    Behavior Analysis  The analysis used to look at behaviors of participants (in this instance clicking to a webpage) was a chi-square test of independence (Hypothesis 2B). Due to their only being nine cases the researchers weighted the cases based on the frequency of responses and the analysis included the bootstrapping of the nine responses. There is a significant relationship between framing condition and accessing the website, x2 (1, N = 419) = 98.67, p < 0.001, Cramer’s V = 48.7. Given the frame condition and whether or not a participant accessed an additional website, participants exposed to a gain frame message for alcohol use accessed the additional website (76%) more than participants exposed to a loss frame message for alcohol use (24%). Participants exposed to a loss frame message for risky sexual behaviors accessed the website (77%) more compared to participants exposed to a gain frame messages for risky sexual behaviors (23%). The results should be interpreted with caution, but suggest that framing messages separately for risky sexual behaviors and drinking behaviors produce separate results in a college age population. These findings are shown in Table 21.                 96    Table 21  Results of Hypotheses Analyzed   Analysis  Significant Hypothesis 1        A 2x2x2 Factorial ANOVA (Main Effect) No      B 2x2 Factorial ANOVA (Main Effect)  No Hypothesis 2        A 2x2x2 Factorial ANOVA (Main Effect)  No      B 2x2 Factorial ANOVA (Main Effect)  No Hypothesis 3        A 2x2x2 Factorial ANOVA (Main Effect)  Yes      B 2x2 Factorial ANOVA (Main Effect)  Yes Hypothesis 4        A 2x2 Factorial ANOVA (Interactions)  No      B 2x2 Factorial ANOVA (Interactions)  No Hypothesis 5        A 2x2x2 Factorial ANOVA (Interactions)  No      B 2x2 Factorial ANOVA (Interactions)  No Hypothesis 6        A Chi Square Test of Independence  Partial      B Chi Square Test of Independence  Partial        97  CHAPTER 4   DISCUSSION   This chapter will discuss the results of the present study, followed by implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research.   Discussion of Findings  Previous research has examined the relationships between gain- and loss-framed messages (e.g., Bartels et al., 2010; Mahoney et al., 2011; Rothman et al., 2006; Quick et al., 2015), regulatory focus (Higgins, 2000), and psychological reactance (e.g., Burgoon et al., 2002; Mahoney et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2006; Quick et al., 2011) on health related behaviors and behavioral intentions, albeit not collectively. The initial goal of the study was to measure both behavioral intentions and actual behaviors; however, there were not enough individuals who participated in the behavioral measures to assess for actual behaviors for psychological reactance and regulatory focus. Using the variables psychological reactance, regulatory focus, and message framing, this study examined differences between message frames (gain vs. loss) and “types” of people, specifically in reference to psychological reactance and regulatory focus. The central focus of the study was to determine if there exists an interaction between psychological reactance, regulatory focus, and message framing. Results demonstrated main effects for psychological reactance on behavioral intentions for both alcohol use and risky sexual 98   behaviors. The hypothesis that individuals with low-psychological reactance and promotion-oriented regulatory focus would report greater behavioral intentions regarding alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors when exposed to gain-framed messages was not supported. Encountering an unequal sample size resulted in the use of three 2x2 ANOVAs to evaluate risky sexual behaviors. Since few participants accessed the online portal (n =9) and none attended the follow-up seminars, actual behaviors could not be assessed for psychological reactance and regulatory focus. Hypothesis One (A & B) Hypothesis 1(a) stated that individuals exposed to gain-framed messages would report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use than individuals exposed to a loss-framed message. Hypothesis 1(b) stated that individuals exposed to gain-framed messages would report significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors than individuals exposed to a loss-framed message. Results of the factorial ANOVAs did not support Hypothesis One and did not replicate previous findings (e.g., Gerend & Cullen, 2008; Jones et al., 2003; Millar & Millar, 2000). In the present study, there were no differences between gain- and loss-framed messages on behavioral intentions for alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors. Possible explanations for the current findings include a smaller sample size, cohort effects, and/or various factors due to region and culture. It is recommended that future studies look to incorporate a more diverse sample and altogether larger sample size. Additionally, it is likely that participants did not view their sexual and drinking behaviors as a point of concern. There were, however, no items in the study that asked this question.   99    Hypothesis Two (A & B) Hypothesis 2(a) stated that individuals with promotion regulatory focus would report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use than individuals with prevention regulatory focus. Hypothesis 2(b) stated that individuals with promotion regulatory focus would report significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors than individuals with prevention regulatory focus. The results of the Factorial ANOVAS did not support these hypotheses. There was no difference for either behavioral intentions in regulatory focus, suggesting that regulatory focus may not be as influential on decision making as previously theorized (Higgins, 2000). A limitation of this study is that the distinction between whether a participant was classified as prevention- or promotion-oriented was determined based on the mean. Individuals who fell below the mean were assigned to one category, while individuals who were above the mean were assigned to another. Future research should seek a larger sample so that extremes may be evaluated, rather than splitting the variable according to the mean. Perhaps with a larger sample size, more individuals towards the extremes could have been used for more distinct regulatory focus patterns.  Hypothesis Three (A & B) Hypothesis 3(a) stated that individuals with high psychological reactance would report significantly lower behavioral intentions regarding alcohol use than individuals with low psychological reactance. Hypothesis 3(b) stated that individuals with high psychological reactance would report significantly lower behavioral intentions regarding risky sexual behaviors than individuals with low psychological reactance. The results of the factorial ANOVAs supported Hypothesis Three. Results indicated differences in high 100    vs. low psychological reactance for behavioral intentions regarding both alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, suggesting that reactance impacts behavioral intentions for both alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors. Results suggest that individuals high in psychological reactance are less likely to change their attitudes or beliefs (Burgoon et al., 2002), more likely to perceive their freedom as being threatened (Thomas et al., 2011), demonstrate higher motivational states (Brehm & Brehm, 1981), and are more likely to reject what is being advocated (Dillard & Shen, 2005). Though the underlying mechanism is unclear, results suggest that psychological reactance may be a determinant of behavioral intentions, at least for the given sample. According to Dillard and Shen (2005), the four essential elements for psychological reactance include: (1) freedom, (2) threat to freedom, (3) reactance, and (4) restoration of freedom. Perhaps sexual behaviors and alcohol use are exceptionally strong prompters of psychological reactance in college-aged populations. This may also help explain why so few participants sought addition information regarding these risky behaviors and why no participants attended the five additional seminars provided.  Hypothesis Four (A & B) Hypothesis 4(a) stated that individuals with promotion-oriented regulatory focus would report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use when exposed to a gain-framed message than individuals with promotion-oriented regulatory focus exposed to a loss-framed message. Hypothesis 4(b) stated that individuals with promotion-oriented regulatory focus would report significantly greater behavioral intentions for risk sexual behaviors when exposed to a gain-framed message than individuals with promotion-oriented regulatory focus exposed to a loss-framed message. The results of the 101    factorial ANOVAs did not support Hypothesis Four. Contrary to findings in previous research (e.g., Spiegel et al., 2004), there were no interactions between regulatory focus and message framing.  This, in part, may be explained by the methods by which individuals were categorized as having either promotion- vs. prevention-oriented regulatory focus. There are not always clean and distinct categories between the two types (prevention vs. promotion), and dividing the groups based on whether they fell above or below the mean may have contributed over and above an already ambiguously measured variable.   Hypothesis Five (A & B) Hypothesis 5(a) stated that when exposed to a gain-framed message, individuals with low psychological reactance and promotion-oriented regulatory focus would report significantly greater behavioral intentions for alcohol use. Hypothesis 5(b) stated that when exposed to a gain-framed message, individuals with low psychological reactance and promotion-oriented regulatory focus would report significantly greater behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors. However, the researcher was unable to test Hypothesis 5(b) due to too few individuals in one of the cells. Consequently, three separate 2x2 factorial ANOVAs were conducted. Results of the factorial ANOVAs did not support Hypothesis Five (a or b).  Hypothesis 6 Hypothesis 6 stated that when exposed to a gain-framed message, individuals with low psychological reactance and a promotion-oriented regulatory focus will access the link with additional information regarding alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors significantly more than individuals with high psychological reactance and a prevention-102    oriented regulatory focus exposed to a loss-framed message. Because only 9 individuals accessed the link provided, the researcher weighted the cases based on the frequency of responses, and the analysis included the bootstrapping of the 9 responses. There is a significant relationship between framing condition and accessing the website, x2 (1, N = 419) = 98.67, p < 0.001, Cramer’s V = 48.7. Given the frame condition and whether or not a participant accessed the link provided, participants exposed to a gain-framed message for alcohol use accessed the link provided (76%) more than individuals exposed to a gain-framed message for risky sexual behaviors (24%). Individuals exposed to a loss-framed message pertaining to risky sexual behaviors accessed the link provided more (77%) than individuals exposed to a gain-framed message for risky sexual behaviors. Results should be interpreted with caution, yet suggest that framing messages separately for risky sexual behaviors and drinking behaviors produce separate results in a college-age population.  Exploratory Analysis  An exploratory analysis was conducted to assess for an interaction when accounting for psychological reactance. Based on evaluation of the means plots, data suggested an interaction for those low in psychological reactance. Results indicated that, for those low in psychological reactance, individuals in the gain frame message condition with prevention-oriented regulatory focus, and those in the loss frame message condition with promotion-oriented regulatory focus reported higher risky sexual behavioral intentions than individuals in the gain frame message condition with promotion-oriented regulatory focus and those in the loss framed message condition with prevention-oriented regulatory focus. This finding is contradictory to what the researcher would have 103    hypothesized. Since promotion-oriented individuals think more in terms of advancement, achievement, and accomplishment, it would appear that such individuals respond more favorably to gain-framed messages. Likewise, prevention-oriented individuals, who tend to focus on minimizing negative outcomes and losses, may respond more favorably to loss-framed messages (Spiegel et al., 2004). It is important to emphasize that this trend is only viewed for individuals who met criteria (who fell below the mean) for low psychological reactance in this study. This trend was also observed in the high psychological reactance group, but results were not significant. A larger sample size may be needed for greater power.   Implications, Limitations, and Suggestions for Future Research  Although most of the main hypotheses were not supported, this study contains important implications for health professionals, professors, therapists, and future researchers. First, the fact that a significantly limited number of individuals felt the need or urgency to seek additional information regarding risky sexual and alcohol-related behaviors reinforces the necessity to establish health campaigns that result in actual behavioral change. The present study provides further evidence that inspiring and implementing healthy behavioral changes in college students is an area of much needed attention and effort prior to the creation of large-scale health campaigns that result in real change.  The current study has several limitations that are worth addressing in order to provide an opportunity for advancements in this particular area of research. One limitation relates to the lack of diversity among the participants. For college students, especially those under the age of 25, there does not appear to be a major concern or desire 104    to reduce risky alcohol use or risky sexual behaviors. The sample also consisted only of individuals attending a university in the south and thus may not be a full representation of college students’ health behaviors generally. Subsequently, a majority of the population was white, protestant, and female. Future research would benefit from collecting a sample from a wider population base, including but not limited to trans-spectrum individuals, ethnic minorities, more diverse SES, and educational achievement. It would be beneficial to conduct a similar study with students attending different universities throughout the United States.  Additionally, it is likely that the constructs and variables assessed in this study did not accurately capture and convey the necessary nuances that should exist in such a study. For instance, the distinction between whether a participant was classified as prevention- or promotion-oriented was determined based on a mean split. Individuals who fell below the mean were assigned to one category, while individuals who fell above the mean were assigned to another. Future research should look to gain a larger sample so that extremes may be evaluated, rather than splitting the variable according to the mean. Perhaps the top third and bottom third should be compared, and perhaps with a larger sample size, more individuals towards the extremes could have been used for more distinct regulatory focus patterns. Moreover, the study did not make explicit recommendations in the message frames, such that when participants were surveyed regarding their likelihood to adhere to behavioral recommendations as indicated in the message frames. Participants may have been confused, as they did not perceive that any behavioral recommendations were explicitly offered. Furthermore, “practicing safe sex” was not explicitly defined in the survey for participants other than “condom use.” Perhaps 105    more information and/or explicit recommendations or definitions would have been useful. Future studies should include easily distinguishable message frames and concrete recommendations.   Future research should examine psychological reactance as a covariate when assessing regulatory focus and message framing. Psychological reactance had a significant impact on the means in the current study, and suggests that if future researchers want to study message framing, they should control for psychological reactance in order to effectively do so. Additionally, and as previously mentioned, Dillard and Shen (2005) distinguish four essential elements for psychological reactance: (1) freedom, (2) threat to freedom, (3) reactance, and (4) restoration of freedom. Future research that aims to evaluate psychological reactance and message framing should look to incorporate message frames that specifically engage these four dimensions of psychological reactance.  The present findings also suggest that college-aged populations may not interested in accessing additional information, either online or in person. However, a majority of the data was collected during the final three weeks of the academic quarter, and many participants may have found themselves only completing the survey for extra credit, with no perceived additional benefit of seeking out additional information on the subject such as preparing for finals. Many participants may also have had other responsibilities, given the time in which data was collected, deemed more important than seeking out additional information on the subject, such as preparing for finals. Future research on college-aged individuals, at least regarding sexual behaviors and alcohol use, may benefit from brief interventions that assess actual behavioral change. Unfortunately, the current study was 106    unable to measure actual behavioral change due to limited participants either seeking additional information provided online or attending one of the in-person seminars offered.  Future research should also include consideration of the use of incentives with message framing and psychological reactance, as well as regulatory focus. Future research should consider the use of separate message frames for individuals low in psychological reactance vs. individuals high in psychological reactance. When it comes to risky sexual behaviors, individuals low in psychological reactance appear to be particularly sensitive to both prevention-oriented and promotion-oriented regulatory focus, as well as both gain- and loss-framed messages. This calls for a more thorough evaluation of the role of psychological reactance in message framing and behavioral health decision-making.    Conclusion    Health professionals continue to debate how best to facilitate healthy behavioral changes in clients/patients. Risky sexual behaviors and alcohol use are of particular threat to college-aged individuals. The current study investigated the effects of message framing, psychological reactance, and regulatory focus in creating some of these healthy behavioral changes. As mental health professionals, we often wonder how to inspire a client to “buy in” to adopting and incorporating our behavioral recommendations. However, as threats such as injuries and deaths from alcohol use and venereal disease resulting from risky or inappropriate sexual behaviors continue to remain high for college students, concerns with facilitating actual behavioral change also increase. While the present study failed to find significant effects of message frames, psychological reactance 107    or regulatory focus on actual behaviors in college students, the present study is not without relevance, particularly in regard to that which is related to psychological reactant states. It should be noted that despite limited data for participants who accessed the link (n = 9), results revealed that gain-framed messages for alcohol use and loss-framed messages for risky sexual behaviors were more effective in getting participants to click on the link provided for access to additional information on risky behaviors pertaining to alcohol use and sex. Future research should examine these relationships and the outcome of exposing college-age individuals to different message frames for different risky behaviors. As previously mentioned, little research in these particular areas exists and further exploration is desperately needed. The findings of the present study provide direction for improving the effectiveness of health campaigns and urge us to continue our explorative endeavors, and to find the means by which we can effectively facilitate positive health behavioral change.  .     108  REFERENCES   American Psychiatric Association.

Health: Responsible alcohol use can help you avoid immediate negative health consequences. Responsible alcohol use will increase the likelihood of driving safely, having a healthy liver, and maintaining a healthy weight. Moreover, individuals who drink responsibly are less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. They are less likely at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), unintended pregnancy, and regretted sexual experiences.   Psychological: Responsible alcohol use now can help you avoid psychological problems that can occur soon after drinking. Limiting alcohol use can help preserve your judgment, memory, and ability to concentrate. Limiting alcohol use may lead to better mood and higher self-esteem in the near future.   Social and Performance: Responsible alcohol use can help you avoid immediate social embarrassment and damage to your relationships. Drinking responsibly can help you avoid doing or saying something you’ll regret, getting into arguments or conflicts with friends or family, and experiencing relationship problems due to heavy drinking. Drinking responsibly can also help you avoid negative consequences such as missing classes, poor job performance, and academic failure. By not drinking heavily, you increase your likelihood of academic and career success.      133    Loss-framed message (Alcohol Use)   DID YOU KNOW?!?  Health: Irresponsible alcohol use can lead you to experience immediate negative health consequences. Drinking irresponsibly increases the likelihood of driving accidents, having an unhealthy liver, and gaining weight. Moreover, people who drink irresponsibly are more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors. People who drink irresponsibly are at a greater risk for acquiring sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), unintended pregnancy, and regretted sexual experiences.   Psychological: Not limiting your alcohol use now can lead you to experience psychological problems likely to occur soon after drinking. Alcohol use may result in impaired judgment, poorer memory, and difficulty concentrating. Irresponsible alcohol use may lead to depressed mood and lower self-esteem in the near future.   Social and Performance: Drinking heavily can lead to immediate social embarrassment and damage your relationships. Irresponsible drinking can lead to doing or saying something you will regret, getting into arguments or conflicts with friends or family, and experiencing relationship problems. Irresponsible drinking can also lead to missed classes, poor job performance, and academic failure. By drinking heavily, you decrease your likelihood of academic and career success.     134    Gain-framed message (Risky Sexual Behaviors)  DID YOU KNOW?!?  Health: Practicing safe sex (e.g., condom use) can help decrease your chances of contracting an STD. Safe sex can help protect your sexual partner(s) from acquiring an STD and other genital complications.   Psychological: Practicing safe sex can help you experience the peace of mind that comes with taking charge of your body and your health.  Social and Performance: Practicing safe sex decreases your risk of acquiring an STD and unwanted pregnancy, and helps to prevent stigmatization, embarrassment, and the harming of your relationships.     135     Loss-framed message (Risky Sexual Behaviors)  DID YOU KNOW?!?  Health: Engaging in unsafe sex (e.g., no condom use) can increase your chances of contracting an STD. Unsafe sex places your sexual partner(s) at risk for acquiring an STD and other genital complications.   Psychological: Engaging in unsafe sex prevents you from experiencing the peace of mind that comes with taking charge of your body and your health.  Social and Performance: Engaging in unprotected sex increases your risk of acquiring an STD or unwanted pregnancy, which can result in stigmatization, lead to embarrassment, and harm your relationships.       136  APPENDIX D   GENERAL REGULATORY FOCUS MEASURE 137    Using the scale below, please write the appropriate number in the blank beside each item.  1            2            3            4            5            6            7            8            9     Not at all true of me       Very true of me 1. _____ In general, I am focused on preventing negative events in my life.  2. _____ I am anxious that I will fall short of my responsibilities and obligations.  3. _____ I frequently imagine how I will achieve my hopes and aspirations.  4. _____ I often think about the person I am afraid I might become in the future.  5. _____ I often think about the person I would ideally like to be in the future.  6. _____ I typically focus on the success I hope to achieve in the future.  7. _____ I often worry that I will fail to accomplish my academic goals.  8. _____ I often think about how I will achieve academic success.  9. _____ I often imagine myself experiencing bad things that I fear might happen to me.  10. _____ I frequently think about how I can prevent failures in my life.  11. _____ I am more oriented toward preventing losses than I am toward achieving gains.  12. _____ My major goal in school right now is to achieve my academic ambitions.  13. _____ My major goal in school right now is to avoid becoming an academic failure.  14. _____ I see myself as someone who is primarily striving to reach my “ideal self”—to fulfill             my hopes, wishes, and aspirations.  15. _____ I see myself as someone who is primarily striving to become the self I “ought” to be—            to fulfill my duties, responsibilities, and obligations.  16. _____ In general, I am focused on achieving positive outcomes in my life.  17. _____ I often imagine myself experiencing good things that I hope will happen to me.  18. _____ Overall, I am more oriented toward achieving success than preventing failure.  138  APPENDIX E   HONG’S PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTANCE SCALE  139    The following statements concern your general attitudes.

    "abstract": "Excessive alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors are common health-related concerns among college campuses throughout the United States. Previous efforts to thwart such risky health behaviors have resulted in limited success. Therefore, it is crucial that researchers learn how to effectively communicate with college students in ways that increase healthy behaviors and decrease unhealthy behaviors among this particular population. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of message framing, regulatory focus, and psychological reactance on motivating college students to take a more proactive approach in regard to their health and wellbeing. Data from this study were collected from 318 college students ages 18 and older. Participants were recruited from undergraduate classes at a mid-sized public university in the southern United States. It was hypothesized that, when exposed to a gain-framed message, individuals with low psychological reactance and promotion-oriented regulatory focus will report significantly greater behavioral intentions and will seek additional information regarding alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors significantly more than individuals with high psychological reactance and prevention-oriented regulatory focus exposed to a lossframed message. Hypotheses were examined using Factorial ANOVAs. Results indicated a significant main effect for psychological reactance on behavioral intentions for both alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, such that those low in psychological reactance reported greater intentions not to participate in risky alcohol use or risky sexual behaviors in the future. Exploratory analysis for those low in psychological reactance revealed a significant interaction, such that individuals with a promotion-oriented regulatory focus exposed to a gain frame message reported lower behavioral intentions for risky sexual behaviors compared to those with a prevention-oriented regulatory focus exposed to a gain frame message and those with a promotion-oriented regulatory focus exposed to a loss frame message. Further research should explore message framing with low psychologically-reactant college students and their actual reported behaviors post message framing interventions",
