It was founded over a century ago by Boston’s Jewish community as a home for its indigent elders, many of whom had experienced traumas related to anti-Semitism, war, and immigration. Today, HSL continues its commitment to serve communities of need, “inten-tionally welcoming people of all races, faiths, ethnic backgrounds, gender expression, and sexual orientations. . . . HSL is proud to serve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender seniors” (HSL heritage statement).2 Mary Martha Thiel is the director of clinical pastoral education at Hebrew SeniorLife, Boston Massachusetts. Email: marymarthathiel@hsl.harvard.edu. All of the appendices mentioned in this article are available in the electronic version of this journal, http://journals.sfu.ca/rpfs/50With the generous support of the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation, HSL initiated a CPE curriculum focusing on the spiritual care of LGBT elders. This curriculum has been offered three times, and its effec-tiveness has been demonstrated by pre- and post-surveys of student LGBT competencies. This article describes some components of this curriculum. METHODSThe author’s preparatory research drew on diverse disciplines and types of resources. The 2013 Pew survey of LGBT Americans served as a touchstone, especially chapter 6 on religion. A review of literature in the fields of eldercare, LGBT history (religious, social, military, legal, medical, art), gender theory, queer theology, pastoral care, trauma theory, and LG-BTQ health disparities filled out the context. LGBT elder narratives were particularly illuminating. Current writings and courses on the developing concept of moral injury were strikingly relevant. Topical documentary, nar-rative, and fictional films were viewed, and YouTube videos of LGBT elders discussing their experiences with religion, healthcare, and long-term care facilities were screened.3 The author also asked chaplain educator colleagues whether and how they taught LGBTQ competencies in their CPE programs. Beginning in 2015, this chaplain educator supervised three ACPE CPE units focusing on spiritual care of LGBT elders at the Roslindale campus of Hebrew SeniorLife. The CPE students represented the typical diversity for the CPE center in terms of age (20s–70s), religious affiliation (Jewish, Protes-tant, Catholic, Buddhist), sexual orientation (LGB), gender identity (cis- and transgender), and gender expression (along a continuum). To supplement exposure to LGBT elders beyond those living in our HSL settings, students were assigned clinical time in additional community-based immersion set-tings. There, students related to LGBT elders on the elders’ own cultural turf. Students evaluated their CPE units qualitatively by interview and quantitatively by filling out self-report pre- and post- spiritual care LGBT competencies assessment tools. Appendix A contains the pre-training self-assessment items. Students were asked to rate themselves on the same com-petencies upon completing the CPE unit. SPIRITUAL CARE OF LGBT ELDERS51A CPE CURRICULUM: SPIRITUAL CARE OF LGBT ELDERSSpiritual Care of the NonreligiousThe first module of the curriculum introduced students to core mate-rial about spiritual care of the nonreligious.4 Although not all LGBT elders are religiously unaffiliated or have had negative experiences with religion, many in the 80+ age group are not affiliated and have had negative experi-ences with religion. It is important for chaplains who serve LGBT elders to befriend the parts of themselves that can imagine disaffiliating with reli-gion, not trusting religious people, and wanting to avoid or offend religious authority. Without this preparatory work, chaplains may not be able to sum-mon the patience or resilience needed to gain the trust of these oldest LGBT elders.Connections between Sexuality and Spirituality: The group was asked to brainstorm ways that sexuality and spiritual-ity are, at a minimum, arenas for parallel process and at times are even di-rectly intertwined. Some of the resonances most commonly named included • relationship with an Other • experience of love, comfort, joy, peace • being powerfully drawn toward the Other • temporary loss of boundaries in union with the Other • sense of mystery, inability to put an experience into words • such powerful experiences that behavioral limits  are set on both by groups and/or society• abuse in either realm has ripple effects on the person’s well-beingMany elders have directly or indirectly experienced religious abuse and brutality for being LGBT, deeply complicating their spiritual lives. This exercise may be the first time some students have considered the powerful impact of LGBTQ-based trauma on spirituality. Once these two themes—sexuality/gender and spirituality—are linked in students’ minds, much ad-ditional learning is possible. History of Religious Oppression of LGBT PersonsPersons who are now in later old age grew up in a time in which re-ligious traditions were hostile toward LGBT identities.5 Each student was THIEL52assigned to watch and report on a different film focusing on a particular religious tradition’s approach to LGBTQ persons. This was an efficient way to cover multiple religious and ethnic perspectives and for the group to feel the cumulative impact of such powerful messaging. The films were repre-sentative of the religious identities of the students and of the persons served in the institution. Films included:• Fish Can’t Fly: Conversations about God and Struggling to Be Gay (Christian) • A Jihad for Love (Muslim) • Trembling Before G-d (Orthodox Jewish) • For the Bible Tells Me So (Christian) • Holler If You Hear Me: Black and Gay in the Church (African American Christian) • In God’s House: Asian American Lesbian and Gay Families in the Church (Asian Christian) • Departures (Japanese Buddhist)At least two points are worth emphasizing regarding the discussion of these films. First, a religiously wounded LGBT elder may have well-founded reasons not to trust a chaplain, at least initially, because of the chaplain’s role identification as a religious representative. Second, the CPE student likely hails from a tradition that has harmed LGBT elders, at least in the past if not also in the present. What history of their own tradition do they need to learn? Moving forward, what amends might students choose to make? How will students take what they have learned in the CPE context back into the leadership of their larger religious community?6 Each student wrote a theological reflection essay addressing these three questions.Experience of Gender, Gender Identity, Gender Expression, and Sexual OrientationThis topic was the first in a series of reflective essays on spiritual themes that students wrote and then shared in the CPE group for discus-sion. Starting with personal experiences of gender, gender identity and ex-pression, and sexual orientation, the essay then moves outward to beliefs. Students were encouraged to ask questions of one another, particularly when a peer’s experience was significantly different from their own. In a CPE group with diversity in gender identity and sexual orientation, group discussion of these essays opened up connections (and disconnections) be-SPIRITUAL CARE OF LGBT ELDERS53tween gender and spirituality and between sexuality and spirituality. Shar-ing these essays provided additional insight into the connections between an elder’s LGBT identity and their religious/spiritual life that can make con-versation about such a vulnerable topic with a chaplain highly unlikely, at least early in the relationship. Experience of OppressionStudents were asked to reflect upon and write an essay about their lived experience of oppression. Each student’s experience of oppression was, understandably, different. Some were direct: racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, or prejudice toward being disabled or having immigrant status. Others were indirect, such as being a second-generation Holocaust survivor and carrying the epigenetic inheritance of neurological hypervigilance and a distrustful worldview. Exploring these essays together enabled students to appreciate the myriad ways oppression can impact the quality of a person’s relational, professional, physical, and spiritual life. This tool helps students learn to employ empathy across difference in experience while providing an opportunity for discussion about appropriate boundaries of sharing by the chaplain in a spiritual care relationship. Experience of AbominationDespite the loathsome history of the Levitical term “abomination,”7 its role in contemporary negative discourse about homosexuality is important to address. Each student was asked to discuss a time they witnessed some-thing they considered an abomination, experienced strong feelings of dis-gust, or felt something was morally wrong. Having acknowledged that feeling in themselves, students were posi-tioned to have a more compassionate and dignified spiritual care conversa-tion with a person who experiences an LGBTQ person as “an abomination.” They were also better prepared to approach the pain of an elder who has been personally labeled an “abomination.” Both are core competencies in this specialized area of spiritual care. American History Lesson 1a This first didactic presents an overview of social, legal, and military American history as it relates to American LGBT nonagenarians. Students were invited to pay attention to their feelings about the incredible sweep of THIEL54history these elders have experienced. Table 1 lists nodal events, along with the age that a ninety-year-old would have been when each occurred. Most student chaplains did not know all this history, especially the Al-lies’ complicity in sending gay men from Nazi concentration camps back to German prisons after “Liberation” in order to complete their sentences for being homosexual. Having heard the thumbnail sketch of history, the group was asked to reflect together on its possible religious/spiritual impacts on LGBT elders. Table 1.

The horizontal rows highlight major events in general U.S. history and in LGBT-specific history. Across the top, the chaplain can enter important dates and themes in the life of the particular LGBT care recipient. CPE students found this tool very helpful in their clinical work.SPIRITUAL CARE OF LGBT ELDERS57History Lesson 2Films offer a vivid entry into LGBT history. Here again, each student chose a different film to watch and summarize for the group, noting how the factual events portrayed might impact spiritual dynamics today. Some of the films were• Coming Out Under Fire (documentary about the experiences of American lesbians and gay men in World War II) • Open Secrets (documentary about Canada’s approach to homosexuality within the military during World War II) • Paragraph 175 (documentary about the German law that led to gay men being interred in camps during World War II)• How to Survive a Plague (documentary about AIDS before the drug cock-tail made it more a chronic than an inevitably terminal illness) • Out of the Past: The Struggle for Gay and Lesbian Rights in America (documentary) • Before Stonewall/After Stonewall (two-part documentary about the strug-gle for LGBT civil rights in the United States) • The Celluloid Closet (documentary about gay and lesbian portrayals in Hollywood films, thereby chronicling public attitudes) • Boys Beware (public service announcement created by the Inglewood (California) Police Department in 1961 and rereleased in 2007 as an ex-ample of historic anti-homosexual propaganda)Sacred Text StudyBecause the majority of HSL patients and residents are Jewish and the institution has a Jewish identity, every CPE unit includes Jewish text study. In the LGBT-focused units, Rabbi Steve Greenberg (the first openly gay Or-thodox rabbi in the United States and the author of the core text Wrestling with God and Men: Homosexuality in the Jewish Tradition9) was a regular guest as text teacher. He led the CPE group through an exploration of several bib-lical texts (including the Levitical “abomination” texts and the story of Jona-than and David) and Jewish liturgies that address LGBTQ realities as well as little-known historical texts celebrating same-gender love. In addition, transgender advocate Abby Stein led text study for the CPE students, teach-ing Hasidic texts that demonstrate acceptance of gender-nonconforming in-dividuals in that tradition.10THIEL58Theological Reflection on LGBT ImagesMuch Christian and Jewish religious art is based on heterosexual and gender binary images, resulting in some LGBT persons feeling excluded from the images of their spiritual/religious traditions. One lesson intro-duced students to religious art with LGBT associations and images of LGBT individuals from earlier periods of secular art. Each student picked a reso-nant image for reflection, using the following prompts: • What is happening in this image?  • What feelings are elicited in you when you look at this image?  • What connections do you make to sacred sources?  • What theological issues are raised for you by this image?  • How might this reflection impact who you are as a spiritual caregiver and how you offer spiritual care? Each student then shared as much or as little as they wished with their peers. These sessions, like all good theological reflection, contained some moving surprises for the group. Some students felt welcomed into their tra-dition in a new way, while some found an unexpected bridge between their religion/spiritual path and another’s. Some welcomed the discovery of a new metaphor or delighted in finding something of their own experience expressed visually. Appendix C lists suggested images for this exercise that are easily accessed on the internet or through a good library. Meeting LGBT Elders in Person Nothing is more helpful for this kind of learning than having the chance to meet LGBT elders, listen to their stories, and ask questions in a set-ting of openness. In this program, individuals from each of the four LGBT identities visited with the CPE groups. A lesbian speaker spoke about los-ing all legal rights to her children just because she was gay. Fellow congre-gants spitting on a gay male couple attending synagogue was the experi-ence of someone the students had now met. A marriage of fifty years ago that accommodated a wife’s bisexuality stretched students’ assumptions of what marriage in those earlier decades could accommodate. A trans wom-an spoke of her dying father’s public acceptance of her gender at his senior center and how that moment created a new community of allies for her. An African American pastor recounted having to give up congregational min-istry in the face of church persecution and then creating a place for herself SPIRITUAL CARE OF LGBT ELDERS59as a public theologian. These speakers embodied the resilience that is fre-quently the flip side of LGBT oppression. Local LGBTQ speakers’ bureaus can help a motivated educator connect with individuals willing to share their experiences. LGBT Narratives through FilmAs with the previous sets of films, each student watched a different one and reported on it in a group discussion. The films from which they chose were • Reel in the Closet (historic home videos of lesbian, gay, and trans life) • Living with Pride: Ruth Ellis @ 100 (interviews with an African American lesbian) • Lady Valor (documentary about Kristin Beck, a Navy Seal who transi-tioned gender) • Call Me Malcolm (documentary about a transgender United Church of Christ clergyman; highlights the religious/spiritual issues in transitioning) • GenSilent (documentary and training film about gay, lesbian, and trans el-der individuals’ experiences with healthcare systems) • Edie and Thea: A Very Long Engagement (documentary about the relation-ship that led to the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act) • Bob and Jack’s 52-Year Adventure (documentary about a life-long gay relationship) • Silverlake Life (documentary about a man dying of AIDS) LGBT Elder Immersion SettingsOur HSL settings are not unique in having relatively few LGBT pa-tients available for students to visit.11 In order to enhance learning about LGBT culture, students in extended CPE units were assigned to internships of several hours a month in LGBT elder immersion settings. The Boston area has dozens of these. Many are congregate meal and program sites sponsored by various towns’ Councils on Aging or by other eldercare service organi-zations. In the summer intensive unit, the students volunteered at an LGBT senior dinner dance, interviewed seniors served by Boston’s LGBT Aging Project, and marched in the Boston Pride Parade with HSL’s contingent. Im-mersion settings provided an opportunity for service as well as learning. THIEL60Students came to appreciate that LGBT elders tend to feel empowered on their own turf, among their own peers. When LGBT folks can speak free-ly in their own vernacular (without the need for code-switching into or-der to fit into a dominant culture in which they feel vulnerable), their own culture emerges more clearly. Students explored the following questions to deepen their cultural competency working with this population: What are the elders’ distinctive vocabulary and idioms? What is their distinctive hu-mor? How is sexual energy expressed? What are the social networks of care? What spiritual resources are in evidence? What attitudes do they express about the healthcare system? What attitudes do they express about religion and spirituality? Microaggressions in Religious DiscourseReligious texts, sacred music, worship liturgy, imagery, and culture are often subtly imbued with microaggressions against LGBTQ persons. An ed-ucator without access to a speaker on this topic could use chapter 5 of Micro-aggressions in Ministry as a springboard for students’ exploration of microag-gressions against sexual orientation and gender identity and ways to revise or retool this language for spiritual care with LGBTQ patients.12ConfidentialityConfidentiality around sexual orientation or gender identity is a sig-nificant dynamic to be negotiated in spiritual care. Many elders have spent a lifetime closeted and cannot conceive of living safely otherwise. Others, who have been publicly out, decide when they need to enter the healthcare system that the only safe way to receive good care and avoid bullying is to reenter the closet. No matter how openhearted a chaplain may be, it may not outweigh the forces operating against the elder sharing this part of their story. Sometimes part of offering spiritual care to an LGBT elder is to accept the person’s choice never to share information about their sexual orientation or gender identity. Some students need to learn to manage this dynamic of lack of gratification in their work with an elder they sense may be LGBT.If an elder does come out to a chaplain, it is important for the chaplain to discuss the patient’s intended boundaries for this information. Some el-ders are fine with their caregiving team knowing this information; many are not. Chart notes should be written accordingly.SPIRITUAL CARE OF LGBT ELDERS61Sometimes a chaplain can help a fearful patient think through the sort of information it would serve their interests to share in the healthcare set-ting. For example, letting the long-term care team know who the patient’s primary support person is can be helpful; the team need not know the de-tails of their relationship. Similarly, the chaplain can invite the patient to complete the paperwork to allow the person of their choice to execute their decisions regarding end-of-life care decisions and funeral and burial plans. VerbatimsEach student presented at least one verbatim on a visit with an LGBT patient. In some situations, a student wrote up an additional conversation with a patient of any sexual orientation and gender identity about an LG-BTQ family member. Appendix D is a verbatim of my ACPE educator colleague Rev. Alice Cabotaje that can be used for teaching purposes. Although the patient was not an elder per se, the encounter has much to teach about the LGBT elders context as the patient, a transwoman, had experienced religious and famil-ial ostracism because of her gender identity, was at the end of her life, and was seeking both spiritual and religious reconciliation. Creating an LGBT Liturgy or RitualEach student in the CPE unit was asked to create or adapt a liturgy or ritual for an LGBTQ individual or family. Students wrote material that they were likely to be able to use in their own future ministries or rabbin-ates, such as a ritual for a life-cycle event or a general chaplaincy context. Students created services as diverse as a baby naming for a lesbian couple’s child to a Mikvah ritual celebrating a person’s inclusion in the community with a new gender identity. Appendix E contains an example of a chaplain’s anointing ritual for use at end of life for an LGBTQ person self-identified as spiritual but not religious.Learning Spiritual Care of Other Unfamiliar DemographicsToward the end of the program, one session was devoted to making the links between the pedagogy of this CPE unit and how one might go about learning to serve, beyond CPE, a different demographic whose life ex-perience is radically different from that of the chaplain—particularly when crossing ethnic, class, language, or cultural divides. Students were encour-THIEL62aged to reflect on the process of learning they had experienced and the ap-proaches that had been most fruitful to them. They readily named how im-portant the learning of history—nodal events, heroes, trauma, oppression, language of self-identity, and unique religious/spiritual expression—is to understanding context, as well as getting to know resource persons from within the community itself. DiscussionInductive and Deductive LearningSome chaplains might wonder why the more commonly used induc-tive approach in CPE units is not adequate in the context of LGBT elders. Why put so much effort into studying LGBT history? Why so many didac-tics and the creation of unique curricular modules? These are good ques-tions, and they may bring us to some necessary humility in our profession. Because history and spiritual care are typically taught from the per-spective of the non-LGBTQ majority, even LGBTQ chaplains and clergy may not be aware of important aspects of history an elder in their care has expe-rienced. Because of this lack of knowledge, chaplains may miss important opportunities to offer the healing possibilities of contextualized and per-sonalized spiritual care. As a group, LGBT elders are not apt to be forthcom-ing with chaplains about certain formative aspects of their life traumas or religious scars. Nor would it be appropriate for a chaplain to prompt vulner-able persons such as LGBT elders to retell and relive traumatic events. So, teaching some history deductively—through films, lectures, and books—is essential. By combining this with more inductive learning—by bringing in speakers willing to share their lived experience and by students reflecting on their clinical experience—students’ learning is much more integrative than it would be if gained through just one approach. Why LGBT CPE? Baby boomers are the first generation in which a significant proportion of LGBTQ persons have chosen to be “out.” As they now retire and begin to plan for future healthcare needs, they are more vocal than their elders ever have been in demanding healthcare and housing that are not only re-spectful but welcoming. The generation that marched for civil rights and SPIRITUAL CARE OF LGBT ELDERS63engaged in civil disobedience to get the Food and Drug Administration to fund research to fight AIDS is apt to enter long-term care demanding that staff have a high level of LGBTQ cultural competence. Chaplains are well situated to support these culture change efforts in their institutions.Limitations and Directions for Further Work This work is limited by the particularity of HSL’s location in Boston, the eighth least religiously affiliated city in the country13; the high Chris-tian religiosity of most of its front-line staff; the justice focus of the system’s Jewish sponsorship, the significant Jewish majority of residents/patients served by the system; the average age of ninety among the patients in its long-term chronic care hospital; and the strongly LGBTQ-allied spiritual care department. The assessment of the curriculum’s effectiveness is highly promising but limited by the very small sample size. Further CPE units will need to be offered to obtain a larger sample of students. Many excellent healthcare staff training programs that address staff attitudes toward LGBT patients or residents are available,14 but this author is not aware of other educational programs that focus on the spiritual care needs of LGBT elders. CPE programs seem well positioned to assist in the develop-ment of training in this area for chaplains and then, in modified form, for spiritual care generalists.This article is also an invitation to think about additional demograph-ic groups that may have unique histories of persecution, religious/spiritu-al injury, social ostracism, and/or health disparities. Intentional learning about each group’s history might well enrich the spiritual care chaplains are equipped to offer. The author welcomes conversation on where this invita-tion leads readers in their own settings.THIEL64NOTES1 Mary Martha Thiel and Mary Robinson, “Spiritual Care of the Nonreligious,” Plain-Views 12, no. 7 (July, 2015); Mary Martha Thiel and Mary Robinson, “Teaching Spiri-tual Care of the Nonreligious,” PlainViews 12, no. 8 (August 2015); Mary Martha Thiel, Mary Robinson, and Sara Paasche-Orlow, “Spiritual Care of American ‘Jews of No Re-ligion,’” PlainViews 12, no. 11 (November 2015); Plainviews is a publication of Health-Care Chaplaincy Network™; Pew Research Center, “A Survey of LGBT Americans: Chapter 6: Religion,” June 13, 2013, Pew Research Center, Social and Demographic Trends, http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/06/13/chapter-6-religion/.

SPIRITUAL CARE OF LGBT ELDERSAppendix B:  LGBT Timeline Activitycreated by Lisa Garcia-SampsonLGBT Elder Timeline ActivityThe Story of Two Peasants at a Bar—Rabbi Moshi of Sasov“He saw the peasant put his arm around a fellow peasant, and in a drunken tone of voice say, ‘Ivan, do you love me?’ ‘Of course I love you.’ ‘Ivan, do you know what gives me pain?’ ‘No, I don’t know what give you pain.’ ‘If you do not know what gives me pain, how can you say that you love me?’” —Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, ed., Interfaith Just Peacemaking (New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2011), 205The act of learning about someone is an act of love. The more we know about the lives of our residents—the challenges they have faced, what makes them feel fear, pain, joy, pride—the better we can care for them.

Cabotaje Date of Interview: 15 November 2007 Visit #2 Report #1 Length of Visit: 40 minutes Time of Visit: 11:45 am Patient Initials: D.S. Sex: Transgender Gender: Female  Age: 53 Sexual Orientation (if known): Heterosexual Racial/Ethnic Group: Asian: Filipino Relationship Status: Single Number of Children: None Religious Preference: Catholic Admission Date: 31 October 2007 Referred By: A nurse on the Intensive Care Cardiology Unit Diagnosis/Presenting Problem: Lung transplant patient with fungal infec-tion in lungs  Your Request I decided to write about this encounter because it makes me reflect on my notions of gender identity, sexual preference, and living out one’s truth. It immerses me in a world where sensitivities are different, as transgender people do not fit comfortably into society’s usual understanding of sex and gender. They are in a space beyond and/or between the standard categories of female and male. In other words, they cross boundaries. THIEL Background The patient is a 53-year old male-to-female transgender who identifies as heterosexual. During a check-up, her doctor discovered that she had con-tracted a fungal infection in her lungs, and she was promptly admitted into the ICU. After a week of exploring treatment options for Dana (not her real name), the medical team told her that her fungal infection was untreat-able. They also ruled out a lung transplant because she was in poor physical shape and might not be able to undergo an operation, recover from it, and have a good quality of life. They suggested that she consider palliative care and eventually hospice care.  “Dana” became angry when she learned of her prognosis. In the days that followed she became belligerent and would shout at her bedside nurse Joan. Joan, for her part, spent the shortest time possible with Dana because she feared Dana’s anger and was also uncomfortable with Dana being a trans-gender woman.  Observation and Patient’s Initial Concerns When I went to see Dana, she is alone in the room. The shades are drawn. The lights are turned off. The room is in disarray. The windowsill is lined with books and clothes. Her laptop sits on a discarded hospital gown draped over a chair. Beside the chair is her commode, with a soiled disposable dia-per in it. Her food is untouched and the tray is littered with tissue paper, bottled water, and her cell phone. She sits upright on her bed, yet her face and shoulders droop like a weeping willow.  Pastoral Opportunity and Plans My plan is to provide emotional support and explore her feelings about the Santo Niño de Cebu (the Holy Child Jesus of Cebu), which she mentioned during my first pastoral visit. It may help heal the wounds from having been rejected by the Catholic Church, mend her perceived broken relation-ship with God, and affirm her spirit as she comes to terms with her illness.  SPIRITUAL CARE OF LGBT ELDERSAccount of the Visit (C - Chaplain, P - Patient)  C1: (I knock on the door . . . walk in . . . squirt alcohol gel into my hands.) Hi, Dana, it’s me Alice, the chaplain. (When she speaks, I hear relief in her voice.)  P2: Hi, I’m glad you came. I’ve been thinking about our last conversation.  C3: (She looks sad.) I’m glad to be here with you. I learned from the nurse that you need to talk.  P4: (She sighs. A rattle rises from her chest.) Oh yes. (She sighs again . . . another rattle.)  C5: (As she breathes, slivers of white mucus dart in and out of her tracheostomy tube. The wrinkles on her forehead and around her mouth look like pleats. They have deepened and thickened since the last time I saw her.) How are you, Dana?  P6: I’m in pain. My legs are swollen . . . my lungs hurt. I have difficulty breathing.  C7: It sounds like you’re in an awful lot of pain.  P8: (She winces and moves her head from side to side.) Yes, I am. My neck hurts, too.  C9: (My heart crumples.) My heart aches, hearing about your pain.  P10: (She nods.) My heart stopped the other day . . . C11: (A rush of cold wind shoots up my spine.) Oh, no!  P12: They revived me. When I woke up, I was very afraid. I’m not ready to die.  C13: What happened?  P14: (She stays quiet for a while.) I found myself . . . (long pause) in hell. THIEL C15: (I feel another chill go through my spine.) What was it like for you?  P16: It was dark and cold. I was alone . . . all alone . . . utterly alone. Then there was a light. . . . I didn’t want to go towards it. I was afraid. I didn’t feel ready to see God.  C17: What are you afraid of?  P18: I feel that God would not receive me. . . . (long pause.) . . . When I woke up, I found myself praying to the Santo Niño de Cebu. Something I have never done before.  C19: I actually brought you something. (I hand her a package.)  P20: (She looks surprised. She unwraps the package.) It’s the Santo Niño! Thank you!  C21: When you mentioned the Santo Niño de Cebu, the last time we talked, I thought you wouldn’t mind having one.  P22: Look at him! He has dark skin, brown eyes, and curly hair like me!  C23: Yes, he’s carved out of hardwood and has been brushed over with dark varnish mixed with brown paint.  P24: (She admires the Santo Niño and touches his face.) Where did you get him?  C25: From a woodcarver in Paete, Laguna. He’s sturdy and tiny . . . easy to hold him close to your heart.  P26: (She caresses the cross and crown on his head; the curly hair that frames his smooth, shiny, brown face; his long-sleeve, cape-like shirt accented by a collar and a bib marked by horizontal and vertical lines along its edge; the puffed sleeves; his right hand raised in a blessing; his left hand with a globe and a cross on top of it; the other cross that hangs from a chain above his navel; his dress with a five-petal flower SPIRITUAL CARE OF LGBT ELDERSand leaves; and the lace-like design of its hem.) What does the crown mean? . . . The globe?  C27: In its original context—when European explorer Ferdinand Magellan brought the Niño to Cebu, Philippines, in March, 1521—the crown signified Spain’s sovereignty and her empire’s wealth. The globe meant two things: the Santo Niño’s dominion over the world and Spain’s sovereignty over a large territory of the world in its role as defender of the Catholic faith. . . . How do you feel about those symbols? What are they to you?  P28: The crown strikes me more as knowledge of God—gnosis. The Santo Niño has realized God. He is fully awakened and is in a constant state of oneness with God. The globe on his left hand to me means he holds every-thing—kind and unkind, light and dark, big and small, rich and poor—and every being in his hands. . . . (Long pause.) He’s beautiful. (She gets teary-eyed.)  C29: Yes, he is. . . . I see your tears . . .  P30: I pray to him because apart from being enlightened, he’s a child. You know how children are, especially to many Filipinos . . . because they are adored, they often can get anything from their fathers. At least, I did . . . when I was a child . . . when I was a boy.  C31: What did you ask the Santo Niño to ask the Father?  P32: To accept and love me as I am.  C33: (I feel a sharp pain in my chest.) It sounds like the Father has rejected you.  P34: Yes, he has. My father did when I transitioned to be a woman, so why not God, the Father?  C35: Because your father has rejected you, I hear that you assume that God has also rejected you. . . . But have you experienced that from God himself?  THIELP36: I was rejected by the Church, by a priest who refused me communion, by my family, by my prayer group. They all expressed in one way or another that I have no place in God’s family . . . not with the way I am.  C37: Dana, but has God himself told you that?  P38: (She shakes her head.)    C39: Would you like to ask him?  P40: I wouldn’t dare. (Long pause.) What if . . . (another long pause) I ask the Santo Niño?  C41: (I smile.) Why don’t you?  P42: (She closes her eyes. After two minutes, she opens them and she smiles.)  C43: It looks like something’s been lifted. How are you feeling?  P44: I feel light.  C45: You look it. What happened?  P46: I was with the Santo Niño and the Father came. I started to sweat all over my body . . . and then something lifted.  C47: (I stay with her joy.) Did you ask the Father about how he feels about you?  P48: Yes, I did.  C49: What did he say?  P50: He didn’t say anything. But I felt him. I felt him all over my body. He’s here inside me.  C51: Yes. . . . He is in you and he is here with you. . . . And where was the Santo Niño? SPIRITUAL CARE OF LGBT ELDERS P52: He was standing right beside me. (She starts to giggle.) And you know what? He was wearing a dress! Black with gold embroidery . . . something that I would wear.  C53: (My heart swells. I smile.)P54: That’s why he is so loved by his Filipino devotees. He becomes who-ever they are. The photojournalist prays before a Santo Niño dressed like a photojournalist, the policeman lights a candle before one dressed like a po-liceman, and the gay dress designer worships one dressed like a “queen”!  C55: (I nod.)  P56: (Dana becomes pensive.) I remember seeing one in Manila dressed like a poor boy in tattered clothes . . . another one was outfitted as a tribesman; and another—owned by a rich matron—was lavished with gold, pearls, and gems. He also has many titles, sometimes named after the business he’s tasked to watch over . . . Santo Niño in Eden’s Paradise, Santo Niño Welcome de Salon.  C57: I hear from you that he belongs to everyone. His devotees show that he can be anyone, even used for any purpose by his followers. How does that make you feel?  P58: I feel happy about that. I am thankful. Very thankful. I now know that he understands me, a transgender who has crossed boundaries and was punished for it . . . because he is a Jesus who crosses boundaries. Even better, he transcends boundaries. . . . Still far better, he knows no boundaries. And you know what, God, the Father (she tears up) was perfectly fine about it . . . about the Santo Niño in a black dress. He really was. (She stays quiet, then she reaches out for my hand.) Will you pray for me?  C59: (I hold her hand.) Of course, Dana. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit . . . We thank you, dear God, that we, like the Santo Niño are your beloved children . . . that you delight in us . . . for it was You who formed our inward parts and knitted us together in our mothers’ wombs. Thank you for showing us your boundless love and nature and the THIELultimate reality of no boundary. And by your grace, we, too, can become that; that we will experience that; that we, too, are that. In your many names and images, we pray, Amen.  P58: (She opens her eyes. She looks at peace. She clutches the Santo Niño.) Thank you, Alice. I no longer feel alone and cold. I feel warm. God is in me and with me. Will you be with me, too, when the time comes?  C59: God has always been with you, has always been in you, has always loved and accepted you, whether you knew it or not, whether you felt it or not, Dana. And yes, I will be with you when the time comes. ----- Two days later, I got a page. Dana had gone into respiratory arrest. I stayed by her side as she gasped her remaining breaths. She died without struggle. As I left the room, Joan, her nurse, said that Dana was at peace over the last two days and that Dana had asked for Joan’s forgiveness. Joan was moved by Dana’s gesture and cared for Dana with loving attention during Dana’s last days. As I left the room, Joan handed me a box. “It’s from Dana,” she said.  In it was the Santo Niño dressed in a hospital gown. I went to a corner and cried.
