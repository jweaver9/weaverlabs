However, physi-cians receive little to no training on this patient population, and trans patients are often pro-foundly uncomfortable and may avoid health care. This study examined factors associatedwith patient discomfort discussing trans health issues with a family physician in Ontario,Canada.Methods433 trans people age 16 and over were surveyed using respondent-driven sampling for theTrans PULSE Project; 356 had a family physician. Weighted logistic regression modelswere fit to produce prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) via average marginal predictions, for trans-masculine (n = 184) and transfeminine (n = 172) trans persons.ResultsAmong the 83.1% (95% CI = 77.4, 88.9) of trans Ontarians who had a family physician,approximately half reported discomfort discussing trans health issues. 37.2% of transmas-culine and 38.1% of transfeminine persons reported at least one trans-specific negativeexperience. In unadjusted analysis, sociodemographics did not predict discomfort, butthose who planned to medically transition sex, but had not begun, were more likely to reportdiscomfort (transmasculine: PRR = 2.62 (95% CI = 1.44, 4.77); transfeminine: PRR = 1.85(95% CI = 1.08, 3.15)). Adjusted for other factors, greater perceived physician knowledgeabout trans issues was associated with reduced likelihood of discomfort, and previoustrans-specific negative experiences with a family physician with increased discomfort.Transfeminine persons who reported three or more types of negative experiences werePLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0145046 December 17, 2015 1 / 16OPEN ACCESSCitation: Bauer GR, Zong X, Scheim AI, HammondR, Thind A (2015) Factors Impacting TransgenderPatients’ Discomfort with Their Family Physicians: ARespondent-Driven Sampling Survey.

Therefore, we cannot place data in a datarepository or make them freely available to others onrequest.2.26 times as likely, and transmasculine persons 1.61 times as likely, to report discomfort.In adjusted analyses, sociodemographic associations differed by gender, with being previ-ously married or having higher education associated with increased risk of discomfortamong transfeminine persons, but decreased risk among transmasculine persons.ConclusionsWithin this transgender population, discomfort in discussing trans health issues with a fam-ily physician was common, presenting a barrier to accessing primary care despite having aregular family physician and “universal” health insurance.IntroductionTrans (transgender, transsexual or transitioned) persons are those whose gender identity orlived gender varies from their sex assigned at birth [1]. A population-based study from Massa-chusetts, USA, suggests trans people represent approximately 0.5% of the adult population [2].Extrapolated to the 2008 population of residents of Ontario, Canada aged 15+, this would rep-resent an estimated 53,500 trans Ontarians.[3] In Canada, management of hormone therapy,and referrals to and coordination with specialists and surgeons, falls within the scope of ser-vices provided by family physicians. In Ontario, 67.3% of trans people using hormonesaccessed them through a family doctor, and only 30.9% through a specialist [4]. Moreover,family physicians play a vital role in prevention and treatment of both general medical condi-tions and those related specifically to being trans [5]. However, both trans patients and theirphysicians have identified a lack of trans-relevant clinical training among primary care provid-ers as a barrier to care [1,6,7], given limited coverage within medical education [8].Under Canada’s provincial public health insurance systems, access to primary care is avail-able free of charge to nearly all residents. The system does not have universal coverage; short-ages of family physicians (particularly in rural areas) [9], and socio-cultural access barriersremain [10]. As a result, finding a new family physician can be difficult if one is not satisfiedwith care. Having a regular family physician and insurance coverage represents potential accessto health care, the first step in access. Access must then be realizable (free from further barriers)before it can be realized (actually accessed). Patient-physician communication is considered tobe crucial in the process of care, as it impacts both patient satisfaction and outcomes [11]. Fortrans patients, who may not be identifiable to physicians, communication regarding transissues is also crucial to realizable access to both transition-related care and trans-competentprimary care (the latter also for the 25% of trans people who do not intend to medically transi-tion or are unsure [3]). However, factors that affect patient-physician communication regard-ing trans-specific health issues have been studied only in very limited ways. Qualitative studiessuggest patient comfort discussing trans issues may be impacted by perceived physician knowl-edge, in the context of limited training [1,6,7].Trans people have been identified as a medically underserved population that faces stigmawithin and outside of health care settings [12]. Difficulties in accessing healthcare have beenreported in both primary and specialist care settings, including emergency medicine, withsome trans persons reporting avoidance of health care due to fears of discrimination [1,13–15].Frequencies of health care discrimination or avoidance have been shown to vary by age, race,socioeconomic status, gender, and medical transition status.[14–17], with stigma or discrimi-nation contributing to health care avoidance or postponement [14,15] The impacts of this mayTransgender Patient Discomfort with Family PhysiciansPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0145046 December 17, 2015 2 / 16Funding: This study was funded by an operatinggrant from the Canadian Institutes for HealthResearch, Institute of Gender and Health (FundingReference #MOP-106478).

Thosetrans people who need to medically transition require medical care related to hormonal and/orsurgical treatments [24]. Thus, facilitating access to trans-competent primary care is critical forthe health of this underserved population. For trans people in Ontario, Canada’s most popu-lous province, the current analysis sought to estimate prevalence of, and identify factors associ-ated with, discomfort discussing trans issues with one’s family physician. We hypothesized thatthe likelihood of discomfort with trans-related physician-patient discussion is shaped by socio-demographic factors, including age, race, marital status and education, as well as trans-specificfactors, including prior negative experiences with physicians, history of transphobic experi-ences generally, perceptions of physician knowledge, and medical transition status.As research on factors associated with experiences of discrimination and health care avoid-ance has often been conducted using only transfeminine or only transmasculine participants[15,16], it is unclear to what extent these predictors may vary by gender spectrum. Given priorfindings that predictors of other health-related outcomes may vary by gender spectrum[19,20], we hypothesized that predictive factors for discomfort discussing trans issues with afamily physician may differ for those on the transfeminine and transmasculine gender spectra.MethodsSurvey Methods and Study SampleAs part of the Trans PULSE Project, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2009–2010,with data collected from 433 trans participants age 16 or older in Ontario. This remains theonly large probability-based data set on trans health and health care in Canada. The survey wasmulti-mode, completed online or on paper. Participants (including minors age 16 and 17)were asked to indicate informed consent by clicking to begin the survey or by mailing in a com-pleted copy; written signatures were not obtained in order to allow for participant anonymity,if desired. Consent procedures, along with other aspects of the study, were approved byResearch Ethics Boards at The University of Western Ontario and Wilfrid Laurier University.Respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a method of tracked chain-referral sampling, was usedfor recruitment and analysis. RDS is designed to recruit and estimate the characteristics ofhard-to-reach or “hidden” populations, those from which a random sample cannot be drawn[25,26]. Recruitment began with 16 seeds, representing a diverse group of original participants,with 22 seeds later added. Each participant was able to recruit up to three eligible peers, whocould then each recruit up to three new participants. Recruitment continued until the tenthwave to ensure the attainment of equilibrium (i.e., sample composition stable and independentof the characteristics of seeds). Recruitment patterns were tracked using coupons, and individ-ual network sizes were obtained for use in data analysis. Network characteristics and structureare displayed in Fig 1.Because some trans people were only connected to trans communities electronically, whileothers did not have internet connections (or did not have high-speed internet, as was commonin Ontario’s rural northern communities), the survey was completed either online (392 partici-pants) or on paper (41 participants), using visually identical survey versions. Online partici-pants received their recruitment coupons online (which could then be printed if needed);paper participants received theirs via paper or e-mail as per their request. Coupons were identi-cally worded and allowed new recruits to either login directly to the online survey or call ourtoll-free number to request a paper survey. Thus, recruitment chains rarely proceeded throughonly online or paper chains.Transgender Patient Discomfort with Family PhysiciansPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0145046 December 17, 2015 3 / 16To reduce the probability of duplicate participation though “self-referral”, incentives werelimited to a modest primary ($20 gift card for participation) and no secondary (for recruitingothers) incentives for 10 months of recruitment; the addition of $5 secondary incentives inthe final two months did not alter recruitment detectably. Participants also had the option todonate their $20 honorarium to a trans-related charity. For online participants, IP addresseswere recorded, and entries from matching IP addresses checked. If a thread of more than twomatching IP addresses had appeared (it did not), the online survey was coded to automaticallyrequest the participant to call our toll-free number to receive their incentive, rather than receiv-ing it automatically.MeasuresAll measures were based on self-report. The survey instrument is available online (http://transpulseproject.ca/resources/trans-pulse-survey). Participants reported whether or not theyhad a regular family physician. For those with a physician, we asked how comfortable theywere discussing trans status and trans-specific health care needs with their doctor. Comfortlevel was dichotomized from a 4-point Likert scale to indicate discomfort (very uncomfortableor uncomfortable) versus comfort (comfortable or very comfortable).Sociodemographic measures included gender spectrum, age, ethnoracial background, mari-tal status, and education. Participants were classified as transmasculine versus transfemininespectrum based on sex assigned at birth; participants held a range of current identities,Fig 1.

Ethnicity and race were measured using a check-all-that-apply list and coded as white versus Aboriginal and/or racialized. The term racialized is pre-ferred to “persons of color” in Ontario as it emphasizes race as a social construct.[27] Educa-tion was grouped as less than high school, having a high school diploma, some college oruniversity, and having one or more postsecondary degrees.Trans-specific factors included level of prior negative trans-related (transphobic) experi-ences, prior trans-specific negative experiences with family physicians, perception of providerknowledge on trans health issues, and medical transition status. Overall levels of transphobicexperiences were assessed by an 11-item scale (Cronbach’s α = 0.807), that captured experi-ences of discrimination (e.g. job loss), microaggressions (e.g. hearing that trans people are notnormal), and internalized transphobia (e.g. worrying about growing old alone) [28]. Fordescriptive frequencies, the level of transphobia experienced was categorized based on the aver-age frequency of experiences reported: low (twice or less), moderate (sometimes), or high(many times). Participants completed a checklist of 9 trans-specific negative experiences withfamily physicians. A summary variable was created to indicate experiencing none, one to two,or three or more of the nine possible experiences. Perception of provider knowledge on transhealth issues was assessed with a 4-point Likert scale. Medical transition status was indicated ascompleted (could involve a variety of treatments [29]), in process, planning but not begun, ornot transitioning. Since few measures have been validated in trans populations, all survey itemswere pre-tested by the 16 members of the study’s Community Engagement Team for clarityand content validity.Data AnalysisAll analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 [30] and were weighted based on recruit-ment probability using RDS II methods [31]. Weights were calculated as the inverse of a partic-ipant’s network size, and rescaled to sum to the sample total [31]. Variances were adjusted forclustering by shared recruiter to account for non-independence within recruitment chains.Estimates can thus be generalized to Ontario’s networked trans population (i.e. those whoknow at least one other eligible trans person).A weighted frequency was estimated for the proportion of Ontario trans people having aregular family physician. The remainder of analyses were conducted for this sub-group(n = 356). Domain analyses were conducted for transmasculine (n = 184) and transfeminine(n = 172) subgroups, to allow for heterogeneity of effects by gender spectrum. Weighted fre-quencies and associated 95% confidence intervals were estimated for sociodemographic andtrans-specific factors, including individual negative experiences with family physicians. Unad-justed and adjusted prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) were estimated to identify factors associatedwith discomfort discussing trans issues. Logistic regression models were fit using SAS-callableSUDAAN version 11.0 [32]. Average marginal predictions were used to produce PRRs fromlogistic models [33]. Unadjusted PRRs were estimated for all variables. For each gender spec-trum, two multivariable models were fitted; Model 1 included only sociodemographic factors(age, race, marital status, and education), and Model 2 included these factors along with trans-specific factors (transphobia scale score, trans-specific negative experiences with a family phy-sician, perceived physician knowledge about trans issues, and medical transition status).ResultsBased on our weighted estimate, 83.1% (95% CI = 77.4, 88.9) of trans Ontarians had a familyphysician. Among those with a family physician, about half of transmasculine (47.7%, 95%Transgender Patient Discomfort with Family PhysiciansPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0145046 December 17, 2015 5 / 16CI = 36.6, 58.8) and transfeminine (54.5%, 95% CI = 42.9, 66.1) persons were not comfortablediscussing trans issues with their doctor. Frequencies for sociodemographic and trans-specificfactors potentially predictive of discomfort are presented in Table 1, for transmasculine andtransfeminine Ontarians who reported having a family physician.Unadjusted PRRs are presented in the first column in Table 2 for transmasculine personsand Table 3 for transfeminine persons, estimating actual observed differences in prevalenceof discomfort between groups. Here, sociodemographic variables were not associated withdiscomfort discussing trans issues, but some trans-specific variables were. Level of prior trans-phobia experienced was significantly associated with increased risk of discomfort for transmas-culine persons, and decreased risk for transfeminine persons. Medical transition status wassignificantly associated with discomfort for both gender spectra. Transmasculine persons whowere in process of transition, and both transmasculine and transfeminine persons who wereplanning but had not begun to medically transition, were more likely to report discomfort thanthose who described themselves as having completed a medical transition. For the transmascu-line group only, having had three or more negative trans-specific experiences with a familyphysician was associated with increased risk of discomfort, and greater perceived physicianknowledge about trans issues with decreased risk.In multivariable analyses for transmasculine (Table 2) and transfeminine (Table 3) persons,in the models including only sociodemographics (Model 1), being previously married was asso-ciated with discomfort discussing trans issues among transfeminine persons, and no other vari-ables were significantly associated. In the models controlling for both sociodemographic andtrans-specific factors (Model 2), marital status and education became significantly associatedwith discomfort for both gender spectra, but in opposite directions. For transmasculine per-sons, being previously married (versus single and never-married) was associated with a 52%reduction in likelihood of discomfort (RR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.23, 0.97), whereas for transfemi-nine persons it was associated with a 49% increase (RR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.03, 2.14). As com-pared to postsecondary graduates, transmasculine individuals who had a high school diplomawere twice as likely to report discomfort (RR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.25, 3.22), whereas transfemi-nine persons were 63% less likely (RR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.14, 0.96). Being a youth aged 16–24was also independently associated with greater discomfort among transfeminine persons only.Trans-specific factors were associated with discomfort discussing trans issues for both gen-der spectra, independent of other sociodemographic and trans-specific factors controlled for inModel 2. Greater perceived physician knowledge about trans health issues was a strong predic-tor; having a somewhat to very knowledgeable physician was associated with a relative riskreductions ranging from 38% to 63%, depending on gender spectrum and level of perceivedphysician knowledge. Within the transmasculine group, those who had not medically transi-tioned (and had no plans to) were 56% more likely to report discomfort than those who hadcompleted transition (RR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.02, 2.38). Within the transfeminine group,exposure to higher lifetime levels of transphobia remained strongly associated with reduceddiscomfort. Previous trans-specific negative experiences with a family physician were stronglyassociated with discomfort, particularly among those on the transfeminine spectrum; thosein this group who had experienced three or more of the specified negative experiences (seeTable 4 for specific experiences and their frequencies) were 2.26 times (95% CI = 1.60, 3.20) aslikely to report discomfort discussing trans issues with their family physician.DiscussionTo our knowledge, this is the first analysis examining factors associated with trans patients’access to family medicine specifically.

In2011, an estimated 90.9% of Ontarians had a regular family doctor [34], compared to 83.1% forOntario’s trans population in our results. Thus, trans people may be somewhat less likely tohave a regular doctor, making them more dependent on walk-in clinics.Having a physician represents potential for health care access, which may or may not berealized depending upon a patient’s willingness and ability to access care, and the quality ofthat care relative to the patient’s needs. The present study provides a first analysis of factorsimpacting realizable access to family physicians for trans people. Our estimate that half of transpatients report being uncomfortable discussing their trans status or trans health issues withtheir regular family physician indicates cause for concern. There is little available empirical evi-dence with which to compare our results. In a needs assessment of trans people in Virginia(n = 350), conducted using a convenience sample [35], 26% of those with a primary care pro-vider reported being uncomfortable discussing trans-specific health care needs with their pro-vider. Our higher proportion may reflect the broad nature of our RDS sample, in contrast toconvenience samples which likely over-represent well-connected trans people who may havebetter access to trans-friendly health care.Sociodemographic associations differed markedly across gender spectra, highlighting theimportance of conducting analyses either stratified by gender spectrum or tested for interac-tions. In particular, after controlling for all other sociodemographic and trans-specific charac-teristics, higher educational attainment and being previously married were associated withincreased likelihood of discomfort discussing trans status with physicians among transfemininepersons, but reduced likelihood among transmasculine persons, indicating qualitative effect-measure modification. It is possible that these interesting findings are the result of chance anda peculiarity of our data set, and we would recommend further study of such effect modifica-tion. We do not know much regarding how relationship status or dissolution may differentiallyimpact transmasculine versus transfeminine persons or the social support they receive. Whileit has been shown that transfeminine persons are more likely than transmasculine persons toexperience loss of employment and violence [14], which may impact expectations of poortreatment in other settings, job loss and violence were included within our transphobia scale,which was controlled for in this analysis. It would be of interest to explore whether those whoexperienced positions of greater social privilege prior to transition (e.g. trans women who pre-viously lived as married men and/or well-educated men), and then experienced loss of status,Table 2.

A total of 31.2% of trans-masculine and 40.6% of transfeminine persons perceived their physician to be not at all knowl-edgeable about trans health issues. Adjusting for all other sociodemographic and trans-specificfactors, both prior trans-specific negative experiences and the perception of limited providerknowledge were predictive of discomfort discussing trans issues within both gender spectra.This is consistent with qualitative research in which trans participants link provider education/knowledge with comfort or access [1,6], as well as with quantitative findings that transfemininepersons with experiences of perceived discrimination in healthcare settings were twice as likelyto avoid healthcare as those without such experiences [15].More surprising was the finding that higher levels of transphobia were independently andnegatively associated with discomfort among transfeminine persons, controlling for all otherfactors in the analysis; this may indicate the development of resilience and confidence inresponse to social stigma, particularly where the experiences were not directly related to priorexperience in medical settings (which was controlled). Confounding by social transition statuscould be a plausible alternative interpretation (those who were “out” as trans may have beenmore likely to both be comfortable discussing trans issues with others, and to experience trans-phobia). However, inclusion of a social transition status variable in Model 2 had no substantialimpact on results (not shown), demonstrating no support for this possible explanation.In adjusted analysis, medical transition status was only associated with discomfort for trans-masculine persons, among whom discomfort was more likely for those who had not medicallytransitioned (and had no plans to), as compared to those who had completed medical transi-tion. This may be related to reduced gender identity affirmation experienced by trans peoplewho do not wish to medically transition. We note that in unadjusted analysis, discomfort wasmore likely among those who were planning to medically transition (for both gender spectrumgroups), but had not begun, representing an actual higher prevalence of discomfort in thisgroup. Among this group, discomfort discussing trans issues with one’s physician could reflectanxiety about the potential for the physician to restrict or deny access to transition-relatedcare, and could present an obstacle to beginning a planned medical transition.LimitationsOur findings need to be interpreted in the context of the limitations of this study. Since ourstudy included questions regarding experiences with a “regular family physician”, it is unclearto what extent our results would apply to other primary care providers, such as physicians atwalk-in clinics or nurse practitioners. As with all studies, it is possible that some findings arechance results, and are due to peculiarities in this particular data set. Our measures also hadlimitations. We note that our measure of previous negative experiences with a family physi-cian did not distinguish between experiences with past or current physicians, which wouldhave aided in interpretations of our findings. Given the lack of validated measures for trans-specific constructs, many of the measures used in our study were derived by our researchteam. The list of trans-specific negative experiences did not encompass many experiences thatmay be common; for example, we asked if a provider had refused to examine parts of a partici-pant’s body because they’re trans, but not whether they had asked to examine body parts notrelevant to the issue for which one was seeking care. Also, all items are self-report. We notethat patient perceptions of physician knowledge do not necessarily reflect actual physicianeducation. Nevertheless, patient perceptions are relevant even if physicians were indeed wellinformed, given their demonstrated association with patient discomfort and its potentialimpact on quality of care.Transgender Patient Discomfort with Family PhysiciansPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0145046 December 17, 2015 12 / 16ImplicationsThe high proportion of trans patients who reported discomfort discussing trans issues high-lights the need to support health care policy-makers and providers in creating trans-inclusiveenvironments and providing integrated and comprehensive services that actively address transhealth needs in primary care settings.The trans-specific negative experiences we have documented may provide some guidance asto areas for action. Trans-specific negative experiences that are hurtful or awkward, such ashaving a physician think a sex designation on an identity document or record is a mistake, oruse insulting language, may impact a patient’s future comfort and likelihood to access care.Physician resources for cultural humility in the care of trans patients are available [36], andrecently published practical recommendations for electronic medical records may also helpalleviate some of these issues [37–39]. Other negative experiences go well beyond awkwardnessand may directly compromise quality of care. That trans patients reported having family physi-cians refuse to discuss trans issues, refuse to examine parts of their bodies, or end care becausethey were trans suggest violations of physicians’ duty to care.The most common negative experience with a family physician reported by trans patientswas being told the provider did not know enough about trans-related care to provide it forthem. It was not clear to what extent this was an accurate assessment of lack of training intransition-related care, versus a reflection of situations where a physician assumed that trans-specific knowledge was necessary for general care. A tendency for providers to attribute poten-tially unrelated health conditions to gender or to hormone treatment was documented in thisstudy’s initial qualitative phase [1]. This points to the importance of incorporating trans cul-tural humility and clinical care needs into existing medical education for family physicians. Forexample, trans sensitivity education could be incorporated into existing cultural competency/humility modules, while basic hormone treatment information, as well as guidance on whenspecialist consultation is indicated, could be included in endocrinology-related curricula. Sucheducation is recommended by existing trans care guidelines [36], and supported by the Cana-dian [40] and American Medical Associations [41].Overall, our findings show that even in a context of universal basic health insurance, barri-ers to trans-specific primary care remain. That trans persons were somewhat less likely tohave a regular family physician and that half of these reported discomfort discussing trans-specific issues with their physician highlights the distinction between potential access andrealizable access within a system where basic transition-related care (i.e. hormone therapy,as well as referrals for any surgical needs) is generally provided in the context of familymedicine.AcknowledgmentsThis study was funded by an operating grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research,Institute of Gender and Health (Funding Reference #MOP-106478).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Representing approximately 0.5% of the population, transgender (trans) persons in Canada depend on family physicians for both general and transition-related care. However, physicians receive little to no training on this patient population, and trans patients are often profoundly uncomfortable and may avoid health care. This study examined factors associated with patient discomfort discussing trans health issues with a family physician in Ontario, Canada.\nMETHODS: 433 trans people age 16 and over were surveyed using respondent-driven sampling for the Trans PULSE Project; 356 had a family physician. Weighted logistic regression models were fit to produce prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) via average marginal predictions, for transmasculine (n = 184) and transfeminine (n = 172) trans persons.\nRESULTS: Among the 83.1% (95% CI = 77.4, 88.9) of trans Ontarians who had a family physician, approximately half reported discomfort discussing trans health issues. 37.2% of transmasculine and 38.1% of transfeminine persons reported at least one trans-specific negative experience. In unadjusted analysis, sociodemographics did not predict discomfort, but those who planned to medically transition sex, but had not begun, were more likely to report discomfort (transmasculine: PRR = 2.62 (95% CI = 1.44, 4.77); transfeminine: PRR = 1.85 (95% CI = 1.08, 3.15)). Adjusted for other factors, greater perceived physician knowledge about trans issues was associated with reduced likelihood of discomfort, and previous trans-specific negative experiences with a family physician with increased discomfort. Transfeminine persons who reported three or more types of negative experiences were 2.26 times as likely, and transmasculine persons 1.61 times as likely, to report discomfort. In adjusted analyses, sociodemographic associations differed by gender, with being previously married or having higher education associated with increased risk of discomfort among transfeminine persons, but decreased risk among transmasculine persons.\nCONCLUSIONS: Within this transgender population, discomfort in discussing trans health issues with a family physician was common, presenting a barrier to accessing primary care despite having a regular family physician and “universal” health insurance",
