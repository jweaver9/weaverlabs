Without their assistance with my many questions and dedicatedinvolvement in every step and throughout the process, this paper would have never beenaccomplished. I would like to thank you very much for your support and understanding over thispast year.I would also like to show gratitude to my Honors Council Reader, Professor JenniferKosmin for her help and consideration of my work. Professor Delsandro was my first Womenand Gender studies professor at Bucknell University. Her teaching style and enthusiasm for thetopic of gender made a strong impression on me and I have always carried positive memories ofher class with me. She raised many previous points in our discussion and I hope that I havemanaged to address several of them here.In Fall 2019, I went to Argentina with SIT  for a semester to study with many differentacademics and activists through the program. My time there was highly productive, and workingwith the activists was an extraordinary experience. Much of the personal experience presentedthrough this work and the section concerning El Encuentro Nacional de Mujeres is owed to mytime with this program.  I would also like to thank María del Carmen who opened both her homeand heart to me when I first arrived in the city of Buenos Aires.Getting through my honors thesis project required more than academic support, and Ihave many, many people to thank for listening to and, at times, having to tolerate me over thepast three years. I cannot begin to express my gratitude and appreciation for their friendship.Margo Yancey, Emma James, and Lena Kleinberg have been unwavering in their personal andprofessional support during the time I spent at the program and at Bucknell University. For manymemorable evenings out and in, I must thank everyone above as well as Melissa Farraher, HaileyRobinson, and Kailyn Carr.Most importantly, none of this could have happened without my family. To my parentsBrad and Kijsa Housman and my brothers, Keaton and Taemin (Tate) – it would be anunderstatement to say that, as a family, we have experienced some ups and downs in the pastyears during my time at Bucknell University and through the pandemic.  Every time I was readyto quit, you did not let me, and I am forever grateful. This work stands as a testament to yourunconditional love and encouragement.Housman 1Table of ContentsAcknowledgments………………………………………………………………………...ivAbstract……………………………………………………………………………………2Introduction………………………………………………………………………………..3Background Historical Information…………………………………………………….....6El Encuentro de Mujeres……………………………………………………………….....12Thesis……………………………………………………………………………………...15Feminist and Queer Theory…………………………………………………………….....17Legal Theory……………………………………………………………………………....24Familial Ideology………………………………………………………………………….30Legal Achievements……………………………………………………………………....33Transgender and Non-conforming Rights to Family………………………………….......37Conclusion………………………………………………………………………………...46Bibliography……………………………………………………………………………....50Housman 2Abstract:Argentina has faced many challenges throughout its history of activism as the peoplehave pushed for an equal society.  Different movements have sprung up over the years, but theyhave begun to twist together in recent times due to the need for support during repressiveregimes.  This brings into question the concept of intersectionality, which spans feminist, queer,and legal theory in its attempt to explain the need for overlap, modeling the natural developmentof personal identities and groups like family.  The feminist movement and the LGBTQ+movements have woven together in many rallies, especially during El Encuentro Nacional deMujeres. In the feminist movement’s focus on reproductive rights, they have left out surrogacyrights and regulation, which is something that the LGBTQ+ community highly values and needsto form their version of family.Through personal experience of the activist scene in Argentina and qualitative research intheory and legal results, it is clear that surrogacy has been left out due to the different treatmentof the interests of queer people. It shows that there is a stronghold over the government by theCatholic Church that prevents more equitable legislation that would greatly benefit the LGBTQ+community in Argentina. The right to family should be protected no matter what considering itsimportance to full sexual citizenship. Surrogacy is a right that should be properly regulated inorder to better protect the right to form a family for everyone equally, including gendernon-conforming women and trans women.Housman 3Introduction:Argentina is a beautiful South American country with a rich history, a productive presentand a hopeful future. The people of Argentina have built a standing for human rights and a focuson civil rights, seen throughout their lengthy history, which has required change and movementstoward a better future for all. Today, Argentina is a country that is lauded as a progressive dreamfor Latin America and is regularly making headway in comparison with North America andEuropean countries. Two movements that have worked to make this possible are the women’smovement, and the LGBTQ+ movement.  The women’s movement and women’s activism havehad different focuses throughout history as rights have been achieved, but they have been along-standing fixture in Argentinian culture.  On the other hand, the LGBTQ+ community hasnot been able to hold onto the same level of visibility until recently, even though this has notmeant the same for the acceptance of the movement.As a queer woman studying abroad in Argentina during the rule of the Macri government(2015-2019), I felt drawn to these two seemingly separate areas of activism. Before the activismthat I engaged in while in Argentina, my personal experience was in community outreach in theUnited States that was primarily one-dimensional. This was the only exposure to activism that Ihad had, and I was surprised and extremely interested in exploring more. While in Argentina, Iexperienced firsthand the connection and intersectionality of the women’s movement and theLGBTQ+ movement as the basis of study. After attending what was originally known as elEncuentro Nacional de Mujeres in 2019 but has recently expanded to be called el EncuentroNacional de Mujeres, Lesbianas, Trans, Travestis, y No Binarias, I began to wonder about thepossible connection. The Encuentro is a combined effort of all the previously listed identities andHousman 4works together to actualize their desires for a more equal society.  These two communities havecome together to support one another in separate but overlapping fights for justice, resulting inachievements for both. I think both are equally important and powerful, but the combination ofthe two is extraordinary and deserves to be studied. This combination is important, but it alsohighlights the areas that have been missed by the women’s movement that are very important tothe LGBTQ+ community.In the United States, in past years, human rights organizations and communities haveprimarily stayed separate and have not expressed outward support in the form of inclusion andshowing up for one another, and that makes Argentina’s achievements even more distinct.Sociology focuses on studying the complex system of societies and this relates heavily to theconcepts of activism and change that are essential for progress within these groups.  This certainstudy lends itself  to evaluating the changes within a society and how it has continued to developthrough accomplishments. Legal theory explains how to think about changing the laws and whythe laws should change in order to accomplish more milestones. Many of the significantaccomplishments and focuses that gain attention in Argentina are related to the ideals of family.The imagery of the green pañuelo from the Campaña Nacional por el Derecho al Aborto Legal,Seguro y Gratuito has become easily recognizable as the women’s movement has raised theirvoice calling for reproductive rights, which have been highly contested because of the interpretedjuxtaposition with religion. This has caused problems for those fighting for reproductive rightsand the way that this fight has been shaped to exclude the desires of trans and gendernon-conforming women.Being raised in a religious background gave me an understanding of how religion canprofoundly affect a worldview, especially on the topic of family. For this reason, the effect of theHousman 5Catholic Church on Argentinian society and governmental rule cannot be left out in anexploration of the rights to a family of one’s own making.  In many places, Argentina included,religion is a major part of people’s deciding basis for their core beliefs and this influence canchange societies drastically, which can be explained through legal theory.  While governmentsmight claim to be without religion or to have religious freedom from the declared religion, as isthe case in Argentina, it is almost impossible to fully separate this, and it has hurt activism in thecountry for both movements.In addition to my life within a strong Christian church, my family is a blended one; myyoungest brother was adopted. The right to a family, in whatever way it is formed, should beinherent. Adoption is legal in Argentina and has been legalized for LGBTQ+ couples followingmarriage equality in 2010, but full control over the familial ideals and bodily autonomy are stillnot completely free. The women’s rights movement that has fought for bodily autonomy,protection, and civil rights for women has led the way for Argentina to become one of the moreadvanced countries in the region. This forward movement has helped the push for LGBTQ+rights, specifically during the period following the fall of the military rule and recoveryafterward.These efforts were affected by the Macri government and the rise of activism inopposition to the repressive Catholic government. Macri brought in a more controllinggovernment that caused problems for activism not only during his rule but also afterward. Theincrease in power and popularity of the Encuentro Nacional and the intersectionality that hasoccurred with the LGBTQ+ community has continued to increase the support; this can be seenon the societal level with the increase of acceptance and popularity that the pride festivals havehelped create. Taking all of these influences and driving purposes into account leads to this topicHousman 6of familial rights and how this has been overlooked for people who might not conform to theexpectations of the gender they were assigned at birth, or the gender identity that they weregiven.  The concept of gender weighs very heavily on society and the arrangements that areconsidered “normal” or “right” for people to engage in.Background History of Argentina:Argentina has had a tumultuous political history that has produced many human rightsmovements and focused on a better society for everyone. For this study, I will be highlighting thehistory of the women’s movement and the LGBTQ+ movement. The first to formally developwas the women’s movement which was followed by the queer movement. The differentpresidencies through this time have profoundly influenced the effectiveness of these movementsand have made it easier to track the historical pockets of improvement through time.The first major historical milestone for the Feminist movement in Argentina was the passage oflegislation granting women the right to vote in 1947. This milestone was a significantaccomplishment that had been a fight for around fifty years of activism. Starting in the latenineteenth century, feminists had to use alliances with the Socialist party, professionalassociations, and women of influence to gain ground within their fight for equality. It includedfighting for the right to work outside the home, which was granted in 1926. Eva Peron and thePeronist party worked to engage working-class women within the political and working scene.This increased female participation in politics and set a precedent for the engagement that canstill be seen today (Hammond 2009, 14).There was a lull in the emphasis on women’s rights and their place outside the home dueto the later twentieth century’s repressive regime. However, this did not stop the movementHousman 7entirely, and in 1977, fourteen women marched around the Plaza de Mayo and became known asLas Madres de la Plaza de Mayo. They marched for answers about their disappeared childrenduring the so-called “Dirty War” and used their gender identity as a form of protection to protest.Due to the sexism at the time, these women were not seen as the strong political figures theywere, and they could use this to their advantage. Their movement and bravery are nowconsidered instrumental in the restoration of democracy for Argentina (Howe, 44). The socialactivism that came from the feminist movement did not just affect women’s place in society butworked as a catalyst for the increase of social justice for many other marginalized groupsincluding the LGBTQ+ community. Family and the right to family has always been a focus, andit is important that this is considered as well when thinking about the success in history andmoving forward to the need for surrogacy.It is important to acknowledge the difference in terminology between an authoritariangovernment and a dictatorship. Argentina has experienced both but the difference between thetwo makes the impact on the social movements stronger or allows for more freedom ofmovement for activism.  A dictatorship or totalitarian regime is defined as “a form ofgovernment in which the state’s power is unlimited and controls virtually all aspects of publicand private life. This control extends to all political and financial matters as well as the attitudes,morals, and beliefs of the people'' (Longley). During the military dictatorship (1976-1983)  it wasvery difficult for the Argentinian people to have the freedom of movement that made changepossible, however, an authoritarian government does allow for only slightly more freedom.  Anauthoritarian government is defined as “a strong central government that allows people a limiteddegree of political freedom. However, the political process, as well as all individual freedom, iscontrolled by the government without any constitutional accountability” (Longley). Under theseHousman 8circumstances, the feminist movement and the LGBTQ+ movements had the ability to begin tovocalize and form their arguments, but they were still very restricted.The LGBTQ+ community has had to fight for recognition worldwide, and South Americais no exception. The fight in Argentina formally began in November 1969 during a military rule.The Grupo Nuestro Mundo was founded in Buenos Aires during this time and was the firstformal gay political organization in Latin America. In 1971, they joined forces with the Frente deLiberacion Homosexual or FLH, a more radical group that mainly focused on queer men. DuringJuan Peron’s return to power, they were closely associated with the women’s rights movement.However, after Peron’s death, there was a rise in violence against homosexual individuals. AfterOngania’s government ended in 1973, discussions were abundant concerning human rights, butthey were thwarted by disagreement and violence. The military dictatorship of 1976-1983resulted in violence and state terrorism and the loss of what we now know as Los Desaparecidos.Many were tortured, killed, or disappeared for who they were or what they believed andhomosexuality was targeted by the government and banned from the public media. The DirtyWar in Argentina lasted from 1976 to 1983 and is widely regarded as one of the darkest andgruesome periods in Latin American history. It began with the overthrow of Isabel Perón, thewidow of Juan Perón, the president, and this act was part of Operation Condor, which the UnitedStates supported. The dictatorship that took over afterward was called the Process of NationalReorganization, often referred to as the Proceso. The “Dirty War” that was fought wasn’t aconventional war with an outside force but rather one with its own people. Because the Procesowas in power, the torture and destruction of those that supported the previous president or spokeout against the current rule were rampant and widely unchecked as the government-controlledeverything (Blakemore, 2019). The junta closed the National Congress, imposed censorship,Housman 9stopped trade unions, and imposed military control. The junta also carried out the brutalityneeded to keep this dictatorship in power and would take suspects away night and day to beimprisoned, tortured, and murdered. The main goal was to wipe out the left-wing terrorism, butthis extended far past this goal into terrorizing the entire country (Editors of EncyclopaediaBritannica). During these seven years, 10,000- 30,000 people became the Desaparecidos, a groupof people that were abducted and either most likely killed or never seen again, often enduringtorture first. These victims were largely people who openly opposed the military or were familymembers of those who did, and it is believed that it was done by Argentinian governmentalagents (Moments in US Diplomacy).” The community and FLH lost their influence since manyof the members were killed or tortured after the coup. FLH was almost entirely wiped out, andwith it, the hope that it brought. In 1976, FLH was forced to dissolve, and formal lesbian and gayactivism disappeared under the repressive regime. There were specific paramilitary groups thatwere intent on wiping out homosexuality, and at least 400 lesbians and gay men weredisappeared by the regime that was supported by the Catholic Church during this time.After the military dictatorship fell in 1983 and Raul Alfonsin took control of thepresidency, lesbian and gay life began to make a resurgence and a general “rebirth” of activismoccurred. Inspired by the community’s activism during military rule and at the end of it, theComunidad Homosexual Argentina or CHA was formed. CHA gave way to many other groups,including a lesbian feminist group named Las Lunas y Las Otros, the Sociedad de IntegracionGay-Lesbica Argentina (SIGLA), the Grupo de Investigacion en Sexualidad e Interaccion Social(ISIS), and Gays y Lesbianas por los Derechos Civiles (Gays DC). In 1991 Ilse Fuskova made anappearance as an out lesbian and caused a rise in lesbian activism that led to the formation ofConvocatoria Lesbiana. In addition to gay and lesbian organizations, there was also a rise ofHousman 10transgender groups and activism, and the first pride march was in July 1992 (Brown, 120-123).As activism rose, dissent within the groups grew, and factions began to form. There began to bean emphasis on queer men that left out queer women’s issues like familial and reproductiverights. This forced a divide and caused many lesbian groups to find support through the feministmovement that was also beginning to reconnect and support the LGBTQ+ community, as seen insupport of Las Lunas y Las Otros. This was the beginning of the movement towards a focus ofintersectionality in the two groups.In the current context, Argentina has become a front-runner for Latin America,sometimes legally ahead of leading world powers like the United States with the national legalmarriage equality in 2010 and gender identity protection law in 2012. This status is anaccomplishment considering the severe repression that occurred during the rule of Juan CarlosOngania, who enacted strict laws that only allowed for heterosexuality and cisgender expression.At the end of the military dictatorship, Argentina was not yet the safe space that it is now, but thefight was just beginning. Unfortunately, due to the state’s violent nature, there aren’t reliablerecords of everyone that disappeared during that time. Although homophobia was still rampantafter the dictatorship ended, the activist community took this as a time to fight back and gainground. During this time, the LGBTQ+ community was not the only group working towardscivil rights and allowed for a connection between groups, like the feminist movement. While thiswasn’t always harmonious, it did help groups to achieve more recognition.1989 saw another president from the Peronist party, Carlos Menem, who introduced theeconomic austerity program which would lead to issues down the road for Argentina and itsactivists. However, during this time period, in 1992 Argentina hosted its first Pride parade inBuenos Aires even though the overall size of activism groups was still relatively small comparedHousman 11to the size of the LGBTQ+ community in the country. Following him, Fernando de la Ruainherited the presidency and a massive amount of debt leading to the crash in 2001 and thesubsequent fleeing of de la Rua from the country. Nestor Kirchner was sworn into office in 2003and helped heal the financial crisis in the country. In the early 2000s, the activist communityswitched its focus from human rights to a more narrow approach on civil rights and liberties.This switch has most notably resulted in the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2010 and thegender identity law of 2012 (Shaffer). These pieces of legislation were achieved under CristinaFernandez de Kirchner’s presidency, who succeeded her husband, Nestor Kirchner. Although thiswas a significant step for the LGBTQ+ community, it did not mean protection or acceptance wasguaranteed for the community. The presidency was then transferred to Mauricio Macri in 2015,bringing in a more repressive government and a rise of the Catholic Church’s influence. He waspresident until December 2019, when Alberto Fernandez won the election (BBC News). Womenfaced stalemates in their fights for reproductive rights, and trans women face heightened levelsof violence underneath Macri. (Usborne). While the laws might be on the books after many longyears of activism, Argentina’s culture has not caught up.Latin America has faced a long history of violence either at the hands of outsiders orwithin their own countries. This internal violence has come in the shape of dictatorships, coups,guerrilla warfare, and civil unrest, leading to a high amount of gendered violence coming fromboth sides. The violence that has occurred in Argentina is a main contributing factor to the levelof activism that can be seen. Several atrocities have been committed solely on the basis ofgender, but in these cases, it was most often against women. Women have been subject toviolence throughout history due in part to the dominant culture of machismo. This concept haspresented itself in Latin America in femicidio, or the state’s complicity in killing women, and theHousman 12act of killing women based solely on misogyny (Garcia-Del Moral & Neumann 2018). Theseacts of deadly violence against women have continued after wartime. Still, they now are beingfought by grassroots organizations and international organizations, either by way of support forthe women and families affected or by lobbying for policy change. While there have beenchanges over the years, there are still culturally and politically based problems in recent years.The transnational pressure has attempted to address the concerns of abuse and violence that thesewomen have voicedEl Encuentro Nacional de Mujeres:El Encuentro Nacional de Mujeres was founded in 1986 and has been meeting throughoutthe country since. This type of social activism is not seen almost anywhere else in the world onthis scale. It is self-organized, which heavily contributes to its uniqueness and also itseffectiveness. Since El Encuentro Nacional de Mujeres is a people's movement and is not fundedor supported by the government, they have more freedom with their plans. With this freedom, themeeting is a place to talk about the national government and the state’s problems to strengthenthis feminist movement. Every year, the meeting’s location changes to a different city orprovince to increase accessibility and eliminate the power issues in an effort to make it asegalitarian as possible. Also, during the meetings and marches, women can recognize theirwishes and ideas about state laws in the province that they are from or are currently meeting in.It is generally regarded as a time of celebration but also for deliberation about what these womenface in the world throughout the year. Many people treat it as a time to reunite with those acrossthe country and share their experiences and lives with women they may have never met. At theHousman 13end of the Encuentro, there is a large march in the city held in that year, and the sounds oflaughter, dancing, drums, and determination can be heard ringing through the streets.In its many years, it has gathered thousands of women together and has been consistentlygrowing, reaching approximately 70,000 people in recent years. In order to achieve this change,there was a need for visibility. The concept of visibility for social movements is like water for aplant; without water, the plant dies because there are not enough nutrients for growth. Whengiving visibility to a group that has been marginalized, it shines light on the problems of thisgroup, and these problems are not just this group’s, but they are society’s. The meeting is held ona three-day-long weekend and lets women take a break from their day-to-day life to discussArgentina’s essential issues. Many of the topics relate to the main targets of the women’smovement, but in recent years, they have branched out to include matters that don’t just involveconforming women. If one were to attend, they would see seas of green and purple “pañuelos” orhandkerchiefs representing the overwhelming support of the women’s movement. However, asyears have passed, there has been a shift in the colors of pañuelos to include different pride flags.This development is reflected in the meeting’s name changing to include lesbians, bisexualwomen, trans individuals, and non-binary individuals. Their fight and self-organization pull fromLas Madres’s inspiration and provides hope to those who need it. This meeting has becomemultinational, with people traveling from nearby countries to attend as well as many studyabroad students, including myself, have been welcomed into the fold. The inclusion ofmultinational or plurinacional in Spanish is not only just to include the people from foreign statesrecognized by formal boundaries. The change is intended to include recognition of theindigenous people in Argentina, like the Mapuche. They have been struggling for land rights andrecognition of their claims to traditional tribal land. Indigenous women have been involved inHousman 14planning meetings since the first, but it hasn’t been until recent years that they could make theirclaims and needs be heard amongst the crowd. The increase of the attendees’ diversity has alsoincreased the variety of planned talks; recently, more than half of the provinces’ interests havebeen represented. In a report about this meeting, Amanda Alma said,Más allá de las diferencias que cada partido político, movimiento social, o agrupaciónfeminista expresa, el Encuentro Nacional de Mujeres funciona como un gran espacio deunidad. Una unidad forjada a partir de la diversidad de identidades políticas que semanifiestan dentro del mismo Encuentro, pero inmersa en la gran visibilidad colectiva.1(Encuentros Nacionales De Mujeres En Argentina: 33 Años De Lucha: NuevaSociedad).In 2018, the Encuentro offered discussions on feminism, activities, couple relations, sex work,legal abortion, maternity wards, families, communication, social organizations, politicalrepresentation, communication, lesbianism, lesbian activism, bisexual activism, fat activism,sexual and reproductive rights, health, disability, sexual harassment, femicides, justice,trafficking, work, unemployment, unionism, and poverty, amongst others (Gimenez). These areextremely important and diverse topics which are a great example of why there is a need for thistype of outreach. By having several different options and forms of activism it allows for there tobe an extended reach of the Encuentro which strengthens the entire platform’s wishes. Each oneof the categories that the Encuentro now includes challenges what it “means” to be a womanaccording to the performative gender theory.  Judith Butler, an American theorist, presents thisideology, but Carlos Figari, an Argentinian theorist, sets Butler’s work in the context ofArgentinian society.1 Translation: Beyond the differences that each political party, social movement, or feminist grouping expresses, theNational Meeting of Women functions as a great space of unity. A unity forged from the diversity of politicalidentities that manifest themselves within the same Encounter, but immersed in the great collective visibility.Housman 15Thesis:The support that the feminist movement has had for the LGBTQ+ community has beeninstrumental in paving the way for the community to find a foothold in the activist field.  Thehistory outlined in this thesis shows the foundation that the women’s and human rights fieldshave laid. The women’s movement and their dedication during the Dirty War allowed there tostill be a focus on human rights during an extremely repressive government.  Since these twowove together during this time, they have had a natural partnership in the years following. If youhappen to be in Argentina and encounter a protest, it would be a very common sight to seeelements of the women’s movement no matter the issue at hand. Following the pattern of anaturally woven fabric of human rights movements, it makes logical sense that the women’smovement and LGTBQ+ movement continue this trend. Within a heteronormative andpatriarchal society, human rights organizations that go outside that norm have to work evenharder to achieve recognition; joining forces can make this easier.Human rights is a large umbrella that includes many different facets of interests. Duringthe repressive governments that Argentina has gone through, women have found a way to utilizetheir gender and the gender performance assigned to femininity and motherhood in order to beable to protest without as many repercussions as their male counterparts. Las Madres fought foranswers and for their families. Their dedication cemented their role as mothers and the fact thatmotherhood is an integral part of full sexual citizenship and acceptance in Argentina. This causedthe aforementioned weaving and the consequent taking over of the women’s rights movement orthe feminist movement. Because of their leading role within human rights and their focus onfamilial and sexual rights, the LGBTQ+ community joined in their fight with their own interestsas well.Housman 16This originally had a positive effect on the treatment of the “nonconforming” woman orqueer women within the movement for reproductive rights and familial rights. However, in thewomen’s movements’ claim for reproductive rights for women, they have left out the protectionsof surrogacy in this claim, choosing instead to focus on the right to legal and safe abortion.  Thechoice of abortion is in contrast to the catholic tradition of putting the nuclear family andmotherhood first. The act of surrogacy according to the Catholic Church is another form of adeviant family style however, it is simply an equalizer for people who can’t have children due tophysical or emotional reasons. This seemingly separate area of rights is actually connectedthrough a theoretical framework and the understanding of gender performativity and genderdysphoria.The concept of theory is used in academia as an explanation of our life and thoughtprocesses, so it is essential to the evaluation of the potential for an increase of protection andrights for everyone. Theory presents a more detached view of very personal issues which canmake understanding why and how we do certain acts within society. Family is deeply tied tofeminist, queer, and legal theory because of just how immersed the concept of family is withinArgentinian society. Legal theory shows that the lack of these changes show the lack of fullacceptance for the LGBTQ+ community and pervasiveness of the religious and patriarchalsystem in Argentina. Queer individuals as in gender non-conforming women or people and transwomen often can not have children biologically even though there is a desire to have children.Surrogacy allows for there to be as many options to fulfill a strong social identity, forming afamily. Gender non-conforming women are women who still identify as women but do notsubscribe to generally accepted gender performance of femininity whereasHousman 17gender-nonconforming individuals are people who do not subscribe to either the genderperformance of masculinity or femininity.Argentina, like many other Latin American countries, has a strong culture surroundingfamily tied to religion originally, but it has spread throughout the secular framework as well. Toform a family how you choose, is to say that you have full sexual citizenship within a society andas Argentina claims to make progress in the fight for the recognition of LGBTQ+ individuals it isvital that this issue is considered within the law and society.  Sexual citizenship is defined as \"theacknowledgment of one's own rights to sexual self-determination and importantly recognizes theequivalent right in others  and promotes the capacity for sexual self-determination in all people,enabling them to feel secure, capable, and entitled to enact their sexual projects…”(Hirsch andKhan, xvi). These rights are vital for gender non-conforming women and trans women to be ableto have the same options as any other woman in their own reproductive choices, but they haveyet to be protected in the eyes of the law which is reflective of the values of the society. Thefocus on abortion rights was important because it was preventing people with uteri from havingfull sexual citizenship, it is important to also address the queer siblings to this central movement.Both groups have worked tirelessly to achieve a higher level of equality, but this clear oversighthas put the trans and gender non-conforming women at a disadvantage. Surrogacy should be aninherent right in order to grant LGTBQ+ individuals, specifically for the “non-conforming”woman, to achieve full sexual citizenship.Feminist and Queer Theory:Feminist and queer theory is instrumental in framing how intersectionality has impactedthe LGBTQ+ and feminist movements. In shaping this concept of intersectionality, it allows for aHousman 18deeper understanding and exploration of the progress that has been made within thesemovements.  Intersectionality of identities and gender performativity helps explain how twoseparate movements have had to come together to achieve goals like reproductive rights.However, the lack of prevalence explains how not all reproductive rights have been achieved,like the regulation of surrogacy in a way that benefits both the adoptive family and the surrogatemother.  Through the exploration of the theory of social justice there are answers to why certainthings have been accomplished and others have not, it is therefore integral to the question of howto achieve rights for non-conforming women in Argentina.These two separate fields of study do have overlapping ideas and contributing factors.Using texts from Kimberlé Crenshaw, Judith Butler, and Carlos Figari, I will frame general queerideology broadly and specifically to Argentina. These three prominent authors provide the basisfor understanding the effectiveness of movements like El Encuentro Nacional de Mujeres toaddress the issues of the LGBTQ+ movement. The term intersectionality is the keyword neededto understand the ideology and theory behind the movements. Without it, these movements’agendas would be single faceted and not as influential as they have evolved to be. This wouldcompletely leave out the progressive intersectional agendas that have become increasingly morepopular.Kimberlé Crenshaw is a leading scholar in critical race theory credited with creating theterminology of intersectionality, defining it as “attention on the vexed dynamics of differenceand the solidarities of sameness in the context of anti-discrimination and social movementpolitics” (Cho, Crenshaw, and McCall 787). Even though this concept has a basis in Americancritical race theory, it has been adapted and taken to many other lengths to include queer theoryand feminist theory. It is now a common term in social activism all around the world. ThisHousman 19concept works to undermine the effect that “single-axis” thinking and planning has in all lifeareas, including the social and legal fields. When the Encuentro was solely focused on one set ofthe group's needs, they were able to accomplish the goals, but it did not benefit everyone whoidentified as a woman, which was the original goal.By expanding the understanding and those that were welcome within the movement, theywere able to improve the intersectionality of their focus and work towards fighting fornonconforming women's rights. In fact, “Intersectionality is inextricably linked to an analysis ofpower, yet one challenge to intersectionality is its alleged emphasis on categories of identityversus structures of inequality” (Bach). This term sets the necessary level of understanding forinterpreting the combination of work together that queer, feminist, and legal theory canaccomplish. Intersectionality best lends itself to studies that include the study of power relationsand the issues that result from these issues. It can and has left the body of critical race theory andhas spread into many different disciplines to better advocate for those intersecting identities.Francisco Valdes, a current leading scholar in queer legal theory, defines queer legaltheory as “uniquely positioned to promote expansive critical insights into the various species ofinterlocking isms that keep women and sexual minorities down,” which is why using this lenswill allow me to explore both communities. In movements where identity and gender identityplay a role in activism, it is crucial to work with this concept. It provokes the very foundation ofwhat it means to be a woman within the culture and the law. He introduces and defines Latina/oCritical Theory or LatCrit as a name thatcombines two signifiers, one focused on a social identity and the other on an analyticalstance: 'Lat' stands for 'Latinas/os' and 'Crit' stands for 'critical'. When the two are putHousman 20together, 'LatCrit' stands for 'Latina/o Critical Theory' - one among several 'outsider'strands of contemporary 'perspective' jurisprudence…(Valdes, 148)This way of thinking has been working towards understanding and processing the priorjurisprudential experiments of critical race theory in general. It originates from the United States'Hispanic population but has since spread outside the borders and into Latin and Central America.LatCrit focuses on building a sense of community and identity in its projects as a discipline andis a good representation of the intersectionality that comes from critical race theory.Carlos Figari provides Argentinian context about what it means to be queer and also amember of the LGBTQ community because, for Argentina, that is not always synonymous. Theterm queer was not extremely popular in South America within academia. In the beginning, itonly gained popularity through the English and Humanities departments at universities.However, it wasn’t until the introduction of Judith Butler’s queer theory work in the early 90sthat it even became widely popular within universities and was used to signify “theoretical andpolitical discourse” (Figari, 621). Within this realm, queer explicitly designated a political andtheoretical area rather than the interchangeable term it has grown into today. This was due to adesire to encourage distance between the study of gender and the study of sex and sexuality thatalready had a foundation within some social sciences. Theorists who studied this found the queertheory drawing and dragging them towards social activism as it was becoming safer to do so inmore accepting regimes. Many carefully point out that in Argentina, “that no one studiedheterosexuals and their families to see if they have the right to exist” (Figari, 623).Judith Butler is known for her contributions to queer theory, especially in defining genderperformance and identity. Butler says that gender is performed and “is in no way a stable identityor locus of agency from which various acts proceed; rather, it is an identity tenuously constitutedHousman 21in time —an identity instituted through a stylized repetition of acts'' (Butler, 519). The genderand sex are combined before birth; the sex is assigned through ultrasound, and gendering beginssoon after. This gender assignment then affects everything for the rest of the infant's life. Afterfinding out the sex, the colors of toys and presents are gendered, blue for boys and pink for girls.We have defined activities, chores, toys, and clothes for boys or girls through childhood. Peoplelearn from a young age what it means to \"be a girl or a woman\" versus what it means to \"be aboy or a man.\" These phrases are in quotes because they are the constructed ideals. This is not tosay that there are no real consequences for coming in contact with these social barriers, just thatwe build this based on how we act and what concepts we value. The construction of genderaffects every part of society and how we relate to one another. By beginning the cycle of thegender structure at such a young age, it fools that participant into believing that it is natural,which makes it more difficult to question. While gendering is passively begun in ourself-development, once we are aware of the world around us, we actively engage with genderand gender expectations. For instance, women are typically depicted in nurturing or passiveroles, while men are shown as more aggressive or active. Having repeated large-scale, visualstories of gender that people  interact with can shape one's understanding and relationship withgender. Cisgender women who fit the binary category of what it means to be a woman carry theassumption of motherhood even though this same expectation is not put on those that break thebonds of “womanhood” by having a queer identity. This concept is the easiest to see on themicro or individual level; one can analyze their own body and display to see this phenomenon.We actively make choices for ourselves based on our gender assignment that we might not haveorganically done, but it confirms or denies societal expectations. In order to see why we makethese choices, it is imperative to look at the micro and interrelational levels.Housman 22The interrelational level studies how we relate to those around us, so it is essential to theanalysis. On this level, one can begin to see the impact of gender and society. The combinationof the gendered self coming in contact with other gendered beings results in a sort of \"checking\"of the gender standards, which reinforces the performance of gender that Butler initiallyidentified. Our interactions with others define our gender presentation as either correct orincorrect within the societal expectation. When children are in school, they are frequentlyseparated by gender and assigned tasks that the teacher has accepted as fitting for that genderthrough their own gendering. This reinforces what the children may have already been taughtand further contributes to their gendering project. This constant association of gender with theseroles is one of the causes of gender inequality in our society. These interactions betweenmembers of a community contribute to the macro-level of analysis. The macro-level analysiscombines both of the lower levels to look at a complete large scale picture of the society. On thislevel, it is easy to see the full gender structure and its trickle-down effect. One material exampleof this is gender and the legal system. Law can reflect the country's values; it is hard to believethat a nation that doesn't give a specific population the right to vote values deeply what they haveto contribute. It also shows the real consequences of not ascribing to the gender role assigned toyour sex. Many countries have laws that penalize this behavior, which only works to reaffirm arigid gender structure (Risman 2018).When feminist theory was in its infancy, lead philosophers around the globe began tolook at Las Madres's emphasis to connect their ideology with that of gender. Ana María Bachprovides a basis for feminist philosophy and development in Argentina and studies onreproductive rights in the frame of feminist philosophy and reproductive justice ideas. She waspart of a group of academics that were inspired to construct a formal basis for feminist theoryHousman 23after hearing a lecture in 1987 by María Lugones, an Argentinian philosopher. In a recent workcommenting on how to decolonize feminism, she is quoted saying,It is a matter of the geopolitics of knowledge. It is a matter of how we produce afeminism that takes the global designs for racialized female and male energy and, erasingthe colonial difference, takes that energy to be used toward the destruction of the worldsof meaning of our own possibilities. Our possibilities lie in commonality rather thansubordination; they do not lie in parity with our superior in the hierarchy that constitutesthe coloniality (Lugones, 752).The association founded by Ana María Bach and others was working to understand feministphilosophy better as it was coming onto the social scene by using their various backgrounds anduses this ideology from Lugones that was still in its formation stage. It wasn’t until 1991 thatfeminist philosophy was officially presented in Argentina at the First National Conference ofPhilosophy in Salta (Bach).  It has, however, faced mixed reviews in its acceptance which isrevealing within its own right as to how such theory is interpreted. Bach says that, “Feminism istransgressive, and academic discussion seeks in many cases, perhaps without wanting to, to tamesubversive aspects not to lose intellectual prestige and to be able to play by the rules of the gameof the academic institution.” Queer and feminist theory squarely intersect on the rights of thenonconforming woman, lesbians, queer women, and trans women. For years trans women werenot taken seriously and treated as homosexual men in dresses which is exceptionally harmful togender identities and progress.Housman 24Legal Theory:Crenshaw contributed heavily within the social sciences and critical race theory. Thisway of theory can help set the foundation for understanding the legal theory that explains theneed for the social level and the legal level to reach one another to accomplish rights for thenonconforming woman. Legal theory can help explain the speed, or rather the slowness of themovements’ progress by explaining how a society relates to law culturally. In order tounderstand why the movement towards reproductive rights and freedoms has progressed at therate it has, it is important to understand how law fits within a society and the fact that it can notoperate outside the culture that it comes from.  This is  proved by the fact that while somethingmight be considered okay and decent during one time period, that does not guarantee the samereaction or treatment of that ruling as the culture changes and the laws change along with it. Thepatriarchal ideology behind the nuclear  heterosexual family should follow this thought processand continue to adapt to the complex setting of the Argentinian society. Having rules that arequite simple in their own essence would not be conducive to a society of quite complex people,and each has its own different desires. Specialists within critical race theory are considering thisand are attempting to discover how they can change the system to serve one group of peoplebetter while also not denying the complexity of the situation. With this consideration, it would beeasier for it to last the test of time because the careful consideration that they apply to thisspecific instance could also be applied to others. Richard Epstein and the critical race theoristsare both attempting to refine the current system to better achieve society's freedom and theindividual actors within it. The two different thoughts also would like to increase the law's utilityand make it easier for those who need to use it. However, Richard Epstein and the critical racetheorists would disagree vastly on the best and correct method to use in order to reach theseHousman 25common goals.  With increased utility of the law, it makes it easier for there to be changes to thelaw that might help spur cultural changes as well. This is a vital concept for any activist group,but especially for the LGTBQ+ movement and the feminist movement.Within a story, a character can either be dynamic, or they can be static. A static characteris a character that has little development and generally does not go under any significant changein their beliefs or their ways of acting. However, a dynamic character is a character that growsduring the story and learns along the way. That character will usually develop and go through asignificant change before the end of the story. The issue with having a static character is if thatcharacter has certain traits that are not liked by the rest of the society or other charactersinteracting with them. There is little hope for a change in character that would make them abetter fit for society. A dynamic character, that is, one that will change, does not have thisproblem. The character will change before the story is over to better fit society if that is the waythat they are pushed. A legal system is very similar to an account for a nation, a coming of agestory more precisely. Ronald Dworkin, a legal theorist, proposed that a legal system shouldresemble a dynamic character within this story.  He wanted the law to change and expand to fitthe needs of society.  Richard Epstein doesn’t think the law should be a developmental elementbut solely a static character. Dworkin’s theory of law is more practical and valuable to theideology of the nuclear family in society. If we had a system that was designed as static at thebeginning of this coming of age story, then the laws today would not apply to the society andwould not work to best suit the people of today. This does not open the doors for a possiblechange that would benefit society as the idea of family is developing. The effects can be seen inthe hesitation and time frame that has been given to the LGTBQ+ community in their efforts toform a family in Argentina.Housman 26Ronald Dworkin focused on looking at law at its foundation and how the judges andlawyers interpret the law. He wanted to go to the source of the law to discover what the law is inactuality or in practice. Using the judiciary court as an example, one can see that there aredifferences in the interpretation of the law in non-unanimous decisions. If there were nodifferences in interpretation, there would be no reason for the dissenting argument. Throughexamining these arguments and the source of the law, Dworkin believed that it would reveal thecharacter of a legal system and that it would reveal the morals of a society. In Argentina, itreveals that there is a patriarchal lens that is tainting the view and character of the legal system.The morality of the law shows an emphasis on the preservation of the patriarchal society and ofthe rule of the Catholic Church over the legal system. Some might disagree and say that this issimply due to a different view of the law but Dworkin separates this into a better understandingof law.In order to assist in the definitions of different views of law, Dworkin separated it intotwo systems: the rule book conception and the human rights conception. By using the rule bookconception of law, the law would only exist to regulate. This conception would mean that there isno place for politics in law, and anything that might seem political would be an incorrectinterpretation of the law and the intent of that law. Laws that might seem political would actuallyjust be filling in the gaps left by previous laws, and to prove this, one would have to examine theoriginal intent of the politicians who passed the law. Surrogacy and reproductive rights forLGBTQ+ couples or non-traditional couples might seem like a politically motivated option, butit is not taking away from any source of political power, it is only working to fill in a gap that hasbeen ignored in the past.Housman 27Also, cases that we would consider to be “hard cases” could be solved by reviewing therule book closer. Dworkin pondered whether a law is unjust in a society that follows a rule bookthinking of law to challenge this ideology. He believed within that conception that the laws donot reflect the accepted theories of justices of that society. But instead, it is simply a rule bookthat the people need to abide by. Dworkin favors the second system that he proposed: the humanrights conception of law.To define his human rights conception, Dworkin expands by saying the legal system is adirect reflection of the beliefs of the rights of those in the society. To best evaluate the system,one needs to study law, like learning the humanities or writing a literary analysis. One needs tolook at the reasons, emotions, and motivations of the judges, lawyers, and politicians, just likeevaluating characters in a literary work. Dworkin said that judges should be like authors in achain novel, adding their take before “passing it along” and not straying from the core ideas setfrom the beginning. To do this correctly, the judge needs to evaluate the intent and rationale ofthose that came before them and create a flow that continues in a unified fashion but alsocontinues to evolve the law to fit society.Dworkin says that the chain novel method is the best way for those within the law tointerpret it, but they need to be cautious because it is about moral impact and judgment. Hebelieves that we need to use this method in order to achieve a community of principles. Acommunity of principles is a community with chosen regulations that result in political moralityand justice and ensures that views are represented. With this basis, the people of the communitywould obey the laws out of their own will because the laws were based on what the communityvalued, and therefore it is more stable. When people solely follow laws out of fear of theconsequences, such as fear of incarceration, the law becomes coercive, and if people can findHousman 28ways to avoid those consequences, then there is nothing binding them to obey the law. With thegovernment having a monopoly on the state's power, one should want the laws to be based on thevalues that the whole community has, rather than solely what the state believes. The main caveatto this community's design is that it requires those within the community to agree to be a part ofthe system and have the integrity to abide by the decided values. It is the integrity of the law andof participants that makes the laws just. When people feel like their voices are not being heardwithin the community, Dworkin says that the view of law switches and this is where one can seethe rise of activism, especially in cases like the LGBTQ+ movement and the feminist movement.This view of law requires an acceptance of mortality and morality within the law.  This doeshave negative consequences when morality is rooted heavily in religion, which can and hasnegatively affected the LGBTQ+ community and their pathway toward equality.Richard Epstein also focused on law at its core and foundation, but instead of looking atits morality and how one could add to the law, Epstein wanted to remove the complexity he sawin that law method. He believed that the law system at the time was nuanced, full of errors,allowed people to use the law to find loopholes within the system, and too costly for society andindividuals. With the number of laws that were in place, he said that it created a need for lawyersbecause they were the only ones that were able to fully understand the law due to the amount oftime spent studying it. Epstein said that this was the cost of aspirations being too high for thelegal system. He wanted to create a network of laws that was simple and that were not based onideals for justice.Epstein believed that one should evaluate the system of law based on a cost-benefitanalysis. To do this, one would need to weigh the cost and benefits of law and decide if the lawwas necessary based on that analysis, instead of whether it was considered just by the affectedHousman 29society. For example, if you were considering passing a law that would ensure no one was everwrongfully convicted in effect, but it was going to come at a very high cost for the state andtaxpayers, Epstein would say that it should not be enacted into law unless everyone decided thatthe administrative cost was worth it. This does conflict with religion frequently, which is an issuethat has occurred in Argentina with the strong hold that the Catholic Church has over the legalsystem and the LGBTQ+ movement. With 80% of the country professing the Catholic faith astheir religion it is natural to see how the other 20% might be spoken over when it comes to thelegal system. Complex laws that stem from this religious cultural background leave out thosewho do not believe in that faith. Since the early 2000s there have been rallies in Buenos Airescalling for this separation but, “in 2002 the Church was decisive in beginning the “ArgentineDialogue,” and from then on Caritas and other Church-oriented groups have played a highlyappreciated role in the social field..”, (Padilla, 67). He believed that simple laws would allowpeople to pursue their self-interests better and that the legal system's usefulness would beincreased.According to Epstein, if we had simple laws that operated more like a framework, wewould all be able to pursue our interests with more ease. He compared how our rules of the roadoperate, if we had no laws, our streets would be clogged with crashes, and no one would be ableto get to where they would like to go. Also, inversely, if there were too many rules of the road,the road would be clogged due to traffic caused by following the guidelines. However, with theproper amount of rules, everyone can get to where they want to go quickly and effectively. Itwould also cost less because the administrative cost, such as the costs for the salaries of thepolice, judges, public defenders, or the cost to keep the lights on at the courthouse, would belower due to the lack of necessity. Using Dworkin’s definition of law, Epstein prescribes to theHousman 30school of thought that Dworkin would say is the rule book conception of law. He wants the lawto be seen as solely instrumental, and a means to an end rather than influential and just. Simplelaws would permit a furtherance of equality for queer people, but it also could backfire and givethose that wish to prevent the rights of these people more power through the lack of protectionthat would be missing from the lack of these laws.A few of Epstein’s simple rules that he proposed were self-ownership and the idea of firstpossession. These two rules would eliminate the need for many others. According to Epstein,self-ownership is empirical and very cost-effective; it also removes the concern of anarchy andreaches the perfect balance. The idea of first possession is that, whoever gets the desired objectfirst, is the owner. That object can later be traded through the contract, and the possession canchange, but it can’t be taken away. Epstein does acknowledge that there is a chance forinequality, but he says that the benefit outweighs the cost in this case. He says that this unilateralacquisition would increase the utility of the owner and would allow for them to pursue theirself-interests with their property. He argues that these and his other rules are universallyapplicable and would benefit everyone due to the vagueness of the laws that make them souniversal. Simple laws would pave the way for universal laws in the style that Epstein proposes.The concept of universal laws would open the door for surrogacy to be regulated in a law thatwould benefit everyone in Argentina.  It would also increase the level of self-ownershipaccording to Epstein and greatly improve the quality of the law and society.Familial Ideology:Families and the idea of what makes a good family have been evolving throughout thechanging societies to adapt to what we need to survive. We as humans like to categorize things;Housman 31people, goods, actions, ideas. It comes to us naturally and is done most of the time withoutthinking about it. We also like to categorize social groups, often as what is good and what iswrong. Part of this is evolutionary; it is meant to protect us from what people before us havedeemed as dangerous to the survival and continuance of the human race. One of these socialgroups is the concept of family, and the family has changed to fit what we need, whether it be atribe, a village, a mother, father, etc. This has helped us to define how we think we need to raisethe next group of people, and when a familial group or a member of the family breaks these setroles, it is deemed as asocial.The ideas of motherhood and womanhood are constantly policed in Argentinian society.Gender roles have had a role within society in the past, but as activism has increased, these rolesare being molded to fit what is needed now.  When one violates the preconceived notions of whatit means to embody one of these identities, there are undeniable repercussions. Las Madres de laPlaza de Mayo were allowed to perform their activism because they were continuing to conformto the prescribed gender roles and gender performativity of what was defined as “femininity”.Until recently in history, women have not routinely left home, and this evolution of gender roleshas not occurred without pushback.  The achievement of this change is one of the many of thewomen’s movements, but it has also introduced other issues within the family structure.This begins to weigh the balance of the paternal versus maternal rights, while alsoconsidering the importance of the nuclear family. Motherhood is often regarded as dependentupon men and women’s generalized need for a caretaker. When one separates a male presencefrom the familial unit, such as in the case of a single mother or some same-sex parents, societybegins to scream for a father figure for the sake of the children. Even in a situation like this, theHousman 32“father figure” may be a sperm donor with no objective emotional relation to the child. In a studyspecializing in lesbian mothers and sperm donors conflicts, the researchers stated that,“In particular, the recent reassertion of fathers' rights coupled with the continued undervaluing ofwomen's roles as mothers forms the backdrop for this dispute. The issues raised by this caseconcern not only biological claims and lesbian and gay parenting, but also the broader issues ofwomen's caregiving role and their ability to raise children autonomously from men” (Arnup &Boyd, 7).This is often phrased as trying to protect the rights of every party involved. Still, it justworks to demonize these mothers that have not actually performed any action to directly harmthe child by deciding to give them a home and a life. However, it is strictly because these familyunits do not conform to the conventional unit that they face social issues. This causesrepercussions later into the child's life and the parents as the lack of acceptance puts unnecessarystrain on a family.Loving family units are often sought as safe havens for children so that they can have thebest opportunity to succeed in the future, except for when that loving family unit steps outsidethe traditional nuclear family. Many homes that include single parents or LGBTQ+ parents areregarded as subpar and can receive worse treatment in systems, which contributes to the aversionthat people have towards queer people forming families. “Public tensions regarding LGBTQ+issues, including whether LGBTQ+ parents and their children even “count” as families, arebeginning to play out in the area of education (Watson and Russell, 76). A system that isorganized to teach children is unsure if it can achieve this because of the “moral” considerationof what it means to be a family. These societal repercussions are no longer solely affecting theparenthood and the individual person but also the treatment of the children in public spaces,Housman 33which raises the question: which is worse, a different familial unit, or societal standards of goodand normal? The treatment of families causes a breakdown in the possibility of having a familyin the first place for queer couples. This right is vital to the survival and continuation of civilrights and the acceptance of LGBTQ+ couples.Legal Achievements:Social change encompasses many aspects of a society, the intrapersonal or individuallevel, the societal or collective level, and the political or legal approval. The change requiresthere to be acceptance of the concept being introduced on all levels of society by the majority.For example, the laws can change, but if there is no level of intrapersonal acceptance, thenviolence towards the change or people that it affects might remain the same or increase. Part ofthis acceptance or lack thereof can be seen within the social movements. If one movement hasoverlapping constituents but doesn’t necessarily advocate for their needs as well, then it can raisequestions of support and intersectionality. Both the LGBTQ+ community and the women’s rightsmovement have made several legal accomplishments that can mark the success of their joint andindividual fights and show where there was a separation in the ideals. It is important to recognizethe achievements that these movements have been able to achieve, while also laying out aframework for how to move even closer to equity.Argentina legalized homosexual activity in 1887, but this is not the same as marriageequality, which was not passed into law until 2010. (“LGBT Rights in Argentina”) The earlylegalization date might lead some into thinking that acceptance followed this legal change, butthis is not the case. Argentina has a deep history of discrimination and violence dating back towhen the European explorers arrived and began to influence the culture. Repression and violenceHousman 34were the themes of much of Argentina’s history, especially for the LGBTQ+ community andArgentina's women (Shaffer, 32). Marriage equality has been a very significant achievement thatpromotes the equality that both groups have fought for, both together and independently. Theoverlap of this group is the non-conforming women: lesbians, queer women, trans women, andgender-nonconforming women.As the definition for the previously mentioned identities can vary based on culturalbounds, for the purpose of this study, lesbians are women who are solely attracted to thesame-sex versus queer women include anyone who has a romantic attraction for women, but notexclusively. Trans or transgender women are women who were assigned male at birth and do notidentify with that gender marker but rather use the female gender marker. In contrast,gender-nonconforming women are women who do not identify with the presentation or role ofthe traditional female category (“Transgender FAQ”). In a community that was primarily led bymen in the community until recently, the women with these identities within the LGBTQ+movement fought for recognition. They were also fighting for their rights as women to standwithin the women’s movement questioning the level of intersectionality that was presented.Trans women slipped through the cracks the most out of any other identity. They wereexplicitly left out of either movement, with gender identity protections not coming until 2012.However, the bill passed in 2012 was remarkably inclusive and allowed for one to change thegender marker on identification without the need for a medical transition first. The legalizationof marriage equality and the gender identity bill did not immediately lead to acceptance on thecollective or individual level. There remains work to be done, and part of that work has nowcombined with the women’s movement. Masculinity and femininity assigned at birth are soHousman 35deeply tied to an idea of a pure binary that must work off one another when that is not the case.This so-called rigid setting is flexible even though it is not without fear of societal retribution.Women have been a solid political force through the times of repression in Argentina,most famously Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo, who advocated for knowledge of theirdisappeared children during the Dirty War. There was an earlier political success for women in1947 when women’s suffrage was passed (Hammond 2011, 1). This opened up that realm ofacceptance for further efforts, which have now mainly been focused on the #NiUnaMeñosmovement or Not One Less, which started in 2015 and is focused on eliminating femicides,homicides on the basis of being a woman. The women and girls of today see the effects of themachismo culture, which was heightened and perpetuated during the Dirty War. Argentina has avery high number of femicides even though they are in peacetime. Ni Una Meños would like tosee not one more woman killed because of misogyny and work as a collective to speak againstgender violence. Their demands of the government are for the “compilation and publication ofofficial statistics on violence against women, guarantees of protection and justice for womenaffected by violence, the creation of shelters for victims, the legalization of abortion and theprovision of comprehensive sex and gender education (Palmer, 2017). This movement has had amajor effect on the furthering of awareness for gendered violence and femicide. One area wherethey have been particularly active in is the attempt to remove parental rights from those that havebeen convicted of having played a part in the mother's death. When the Ni Una Meñosmovement started, the father would still have rights to the children despite having played somepart in the femicide of their mother. This contributed to the attitude of acceptance towardsfemicidios as it did nothing to take the power away from the patriarchy on a state level. TheHousman 36movement has achieved success with the new administration and has received a promise that thenew administration will fulfill at least five of the demands (Terzian, 2017).There has also been a focus on the Campaña Nacional Por al Derecho al Aborto LegalSeguro y Gratuito or the National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe, and Free Abortionwhich as its name implies, has focused on abortion rights for women and making this medicalprocedure accessible to all. Female activists have been instrumental in promoting human rightsin Argentina, not just on the basis of sex but in many other walks of life. They have genuinelyadopted an intersectional approach out of necessity for change. They are an excellent workingexample of Kimberlé Crenshaw’s ideas of intersectionality concerning abortion rights. Still, noteveryone has been as open with regard to adoption rights and surrogacy rights, which areincluded in the fight for reproductive rights. This organization has recently achieved their maingoal of recognition and legalization of abortion rights. Before this, abortion was only allowed inextreme cases like sexual assault and high health risk to the mother, but now it has been extendedto everyone up to 14 weeks of the pregnancy (Watson). It was an amazing achievement for theCampaña Nacional Por al Derecho al Aborto but, now that it has been achieved, there is room fora greater focus on the ideology of the family and how that can be achieved for every LGBTQ+person who desires to start a family in whatever way they choose. The focus on reproductiverights is an essential building block to familial equality and the changing of the idea of a nuclearfamily.  Continuing in building an equal society is the family block, which makes it increasinglyimportant to grant non-conforming families the right to be “normal” and have the right to choose.The fight for reproductive rights now needs to shift to a fight for full recognition and away fromthe stronghold that the Catholic Church has imposed over the legal and cultural ideology ofmotherhood and family.Housman 37Transgender and Non-conforming Rights to Family:At the base of the unit, is the family itself, which in most traditional spaces includes theparent(s) and the children. For LGBTQ+ couples, this often is complicated because havingchildren usually doesn’t happen in the same way as for a heterosexual couple. Some lesbiancouples, bisexual couples, or couples that include one or more transgender people might be ableto have biological children. However, this can cause gender dysphoria, because of the need forone to perform the task of carrying the fetus to full term.The Mayo Clinic defines gender dysphoria as “the feeling of discomfort or distress thatmight occur in people whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth orsex-related physical characteristics”(“Gender Dysphoria”). This is a significant complication thatmany transgender individuals and gender non-conforming people face because of how pervasivegender performativity is in society.  Gender dysphoria spurs from gender performativity andshows the consequences that it can have on the mind. It is important to acknowledge the factthat this concept as a clinical diagnosis is contested, however, this definition does have a placewithin the sociological view of the relationship between gender, oneself, and society. Aspreviously mentioned in the theory review, Butler introduced this concept into the literature, andit has been adopted by queer studies almost everywhere, Argentina included. Gender exists as weperform it and is constantly reinforced in everyday actions, which can make a transition difficultbecause of the amount of energy that it requires. Many people who suffer from this don’t feelcomfortable with the gendered performance that was assigned to them at birth and begin toexplore the combination of masculinity and femininity.Similarly, many young adults expressed that they don’t feel comfortable with theperformance expected from them and would “try-out” aspects of their correct gender afterHousman 38feeling uncomfortable or like they were in the wrong body. For someone who does not identifywith the gender that they were assigned at birth, carrying a child can be either impossiblebiologically or mentally, due to the effect that gender performativity has on one’s mental stateand health. Because of this, trans individuals and other queer couples can struggle with peers,family, and society and how this also is personally affecting the quality of their life. Surrogacyallows for there to be a biological connection between the parents while avoiding the risk ofcausing damage mentally or physically by forcing someone to take on a high risk pregnancy.Some regard the idea of the nuclear family, the father, the mother, and children as asacred idea that can not and should be altered for the sake of the children's developmental health.But this is not how a family is formed, nor how it should be judged. Argentina was the firstcountry in South America to pass a bill equalizing marriage for all.  This follows the passing ofcivil unions in 2002. Mario Pecheny, a leading scholar in Argentina concerning gender andfamily who edited a book by Renata Hiller, adds that, “Marriage and family, according to thisdiscourse, have been always (or perhaps since the moment of the first baptism in human history)a determined type of union organized around reproduction, which is why any other type ofaffective alliance ought to be construed in a different manner” (Hiller, 215).  With marriagealready granted, it elevates the importance of securing full reproductive rights for these unionsand breaking away from the traditional nuclear family.When it comes to the concept of breaking this nuclear family trope with LGBTQ+individuals adopting and creating families of their own design, Argentina has passed laws thatprotect adoption rights for nontraditional families, but not legislation that could provideprotection for the potential adoptive family and surrogate mother. However, this type of“patchwork legislation” works to enforce the idea of the nuclear family because there is universalHousman 39protection for only one kind of family: the traditional mother and father with children’sbiological family.  The first case recognizing a gay couple as the full parents of a surrogate childoccurred on June 29, 2012.  The child was born in New Delhi and was the first recordrecognition of two male parents in Argentina.  This case, while a major accomplishment foreveryone within the LGBTQ+ community, does carry a level of privilege that is held by gay menin a patriarchal society.  This couple also had the resources to pursue international surrogacy,which is not an option for every socioeconomic class (Vaughn). It is an important step, but thereis still more work to be done. In the 57 cases regarding surrogacy that have made it to a day incourt not one has included a solely female partnership (Herrera).  Surrogacy is not an equalaccess choice, but by regulation it would allow for there to be control and an increase ofavailable resources for possible families and surrogate mothers.Adoption rights were reinforced for same-sex couples by Act 26.618 in 2014 aftermarriage equality was granted in 2010. This act provided the same protections for homosexualcouples that had been provided to heterosexual couples. This was an important step and providedan option for couples that can not have their own biological children for different reasons. Byhaving this as an option for couples, they can still have the opportunity to have children and forma semblance of the traditional nuclear family, except perhaps with different gender roles. Thepossible excitement for this right is tempered by the fact that there are no national laws thatprotect this community from discrimination. Some provinces like the city of Buenos Aires andRosario do include discrimination protections within their civil rights law. People who live inmore rural areas are more likely to struggle with finding access to reproductive advocacy andhelp (Villar de Onis).Housman 40This movement towards family can still be strenuous for LGBTQ+ individuals, no matterwhere they are located, because they have to choose if they want to adopt directly from thesystem or if they want to go in a different direction of surrogacy or in vitro fertilization (IVF).But even these choices have their own inherent issues that have been overlooked within thefeminist movement for reproductive rights and the protection that the law provides. The grayarea of the law has made these issues into a battleground for religion and the LGBTQ+movement, which has historically caused issues within Argentina.  Through the years ofauthoritarianism and repressive regimes, religion has been used to create an inferioritysurrounding the queer community.  The Catholic Church has influenced a great deal of thelegislation and rulings through the years.  Because of this, these people have had to fight forrecognition of themselves and also their own issues like gender dysphoria.Due to the prevalence of gender dysphoria, many trans men and some gendernon-conforming lesbians can’t carry children, so they turn towards surrogacy. Surrogacy isdefined in two different ways, the first being, “traditional/genetic surrogacy is when a surrogateis artificially impregnated with sperm, usually from the intended parent, but may also be donorsperm, with the intention of that sperm fertilizing her (the surrogate’s) egg, thereby making herboth the genetic and gestational mother” and the second being “gestational surrogacy, embryosthat are not genetically related to the surrogate are implanted into the uterus of the surrogate,who will then carry the gestation to term, the intended parent(s) being the individual(s) withownership of the aforementioned embryos'' (Torres, Gloria, et al.). These surrogacy optionsprovide parents with more choice in the child that they end up officially adopting. The standardprocess is for an agreement to be made between the surrogate and the intended parents.Housman 41Surrogacy is a prevalent option for people within the LGBTQ+ community, especially transindividuals, but these agreements are not protected or regulated by the government in Argentina.The non-regulation of surrogacy agreements is due to the leftover effects of the Catholicand conservative regime. Many groups and Catholic organizations see this as immoral andagainst a good society because it brings into question the ability “to sell” a child in their eyes.But the desire to leave children out of an economic transaction has left surrogacy in a legal grayzone and doesn’t work to protect either party fully. In wanting to protect the traditional familyunit discussed earlier, they are leaving out trans couples who desire to participate in surrogacy inorder to have their own child. The law favors the surrogate mother, and because the agreementsare not regulated by law, a surrogate mother can decide to keep the child even if there has beenmoney exchanged for the service or for the care of the surrogate to benefit the child. Due to thismethod's lack of regulation, transgender people’s rights to a family of their own choosing are notbeing protected fully. The cultural and legal realm should change with the times and with eachother. As the culture in Argentina moves forward and adapts to include more versions of family,the legal realm should as well. By allowing the Catholic Church to dictate the version of familythat should be upheld over the rest, it leaves out the different family structures that are soimportant to society.Despite the shift towards intersectionality that the feminist movement has made toinclude members of the LGBTQ+ community, this is not included in the central claims forreproductive rights. Even though there was a focus in meetings, like the Encuentro, to welcomeand listen to trans women’s and non-binary people’s thoughts, this has not been included. Inorder to reach more equal reproductive rights legislation, these types of arrangements need to beprotected so that both parties are represented and valued in the exchange. This would benefitHousman 42everyone involved and it is so much more than the concern that surrogacy is the act of selling achild. The lack of change in the legal standing reflects the standing of the society and the valuesthat they feel they should fight for, and the rights of the non-conforming woman are beingthreatened by the lack of protection. People have begun to call for there to be a change in the lawcalling some laws unconstitutional. In the case of a heterosexual couple that wanted to conceiveand adopt through surrogacy Sabrina Berger pointed out that this act governing surrogacy isunconstitutional because it limits personal freedoms. She identifies main issues with the lack ofregulation for surrogacy and lists them as,el derecho a la autonomía personal,  derecho a que se respete la vida privada y familiar,derecho a fundar una familia, derecho a procrear (vinculado con la voluntadprocreacional), derecho a la salud sexual y reproductiva, derecho a gozar de losbeneficios del progreso científico, derecho a acceder a los tratamientos de reproducciónhumana asistida según lo previsto por la ley 26.862, derecho a la no discriminación.2(Berger, 1)These violations to the personhood of this couple carries over tenfold into the queer couplesbecause they are carrying the weight of “othering” that a queer identity has within aheteronormative and patriarchal society. The issues also carry over to the inequality that can beseen in IVF with surrogacy. IVF can be an essential part of surrogacy and can also be a costlycontributing factor to the process.A proposed plan for regulation by an organization called Surrogacy 365 has Argentinahaving six different types of action protocols for IVF, and they correspond to different family2 Translation:the right to personal autonomy, the right to respect for private and family life, the right to start a family,the right to procreate (linked to the processional will), the right to sexual and reproductive health, the right to enjoythe benefits of scientific progress, the right to access assisted human reproduction treatments as provided for by Law26,862, right to non-discrimination.Housman 43types. The first type is for married heterosexual couples, and it involves the steps of ArgentinaIVF with own eggs, embryo shipping, a transfer to Ukrainian surrogate mother (SM), and birth inKyiv, Ukraine. This means that the IVF happens in Argentina with the couples' own gametes,and the gestation happens in Kyiv. This would cost a couple approximately 60,000 USD and isthe lowest priced option. The second type is also for married heterosexual couples, and itincludes Argentina IVF with egg donation, embryo shipping, a transfer to Canadian SM, andbirth in Kyiv, Ukraine. This would cost a couple approximately 63,000 USD making it evenmore costly. The third type opens up to all family models making it the most cost-friendly optionto non-married heterosexual couples and would cost approximately 72,000 USD. It includesArgentina IVF with the surrogate’s own eggs, embryo shipping, a transfer to Canadian SM, andbirth in Toronto, Canada. Continuing in Canada, the cost to have IVF with the same steps butwith an egg donation is 75,000 USD. The most expensive options include a birth in the UnitedStates, using the surrogate's own eggs. It is approximately 92,000 USD and 95,000 USD with anegg donation (Surrogacy 365). This would allow for more regulation on the acts of surrogacy butmake it even harder for non-heterosexual couples to use this option due to the financial concernsthat this presents. This regulation would not be as open for everyone as a regulatory system inArgentina would and could be.The plan that was proposed is a good step forward because it means that people arethinking about the future and moving forward.  However, the cost inequality brings into questionif this could ever fully be achieved without transnational acceptance and progress.  Despite theprogress that Argentina could make, if the community doesn’t also have acceptance from outsidecountries that are willing to provide support to the hopeful parents and surrogates, then it won’tmatter exactly how Argentina regulates.  For this reason, it is vital that Argentina regulatesHousman 44within the country itself. Internally based regulations and provisions would allow for there topotentially be a more even distribution of cost for all couples. However, this would first requirethere to be a change in the culture and a lessening of the importance of the Catholic Church’shold that was supported during Marci’s time as president.The major arguments against surrogacy have been from the Catholic Church and isanother form of repression for the LGBTQ+ community. They argue against it for many reasonssaying that it is unethical, immoral, and exploitative for women or couples to engage insurrogacy (Morse).  Surrogacy is not immoral and is a way to allow for more autonomy,something that both the LGBTQ+ community and the women’s movement have fought for.While introducing a monetary exchange does mean that there are concerns to be addressed, thisdoesn’t necessarily mean that it is immoral.  With proper regulation there could be a commonunderstanding that everyone in the agreement is entering into it with full consent and knowledgewhich would eradicate the potential exploitation that could occur without this regulation. TheCatholic Church highlights several reasons for why they believe that surrogacy is immoral, usingplatforms that they don’t normally stand behind as a way to increase their reach. They argue thatregulating surrogacy would drag “baby-making” into the law, but it already has been with theconcept of adoption (Morse and Neumayr).Adoption is legal in Argentina and does not present these concerns, so in an arrangedsituation that is essentially just known adoption from the beginning would not and should notbring concerns into the situation that are not there for adoption. Feminist philosophy argues forthe equalization and recognition of the intersectionality that Crenshaw has given the study.There is an emphasis on the crossover of feminist and queer theory, and it perfectly intersects onthe concept of gender non-conforming women and trans women.  They are frequently left out ofHousman 45the mainstream of activism and the lack of regulation of surrogacy, which is potentially anecessary way to have a family, is a perfect example. As Figari states, it is ever increasinglymore important to protect queer families as they have had to be studied in order to have thepotential for the same rights as heterosexual couples. But regulation would not just affect thequeer women, it would also be a great help to the heterosexual couples and the women who wantto be surrogates.According to the previously established legal framework of Dworkin, the lack ofregulation of surrogacy can be explained by the social factors that are prohibiting the law tomove forward.  The presence of the strong Catholic influence on the government and the overallacceptance of these views within the society shows the moral code that the law is following.However, the increase in surrogacy as a common practice shows that the social level is beginningto move towards a more accepting standard.  As this change increases, it becomes even moreimportant for the judicial and the legislative systems to move towards an agreement with thepopulace.  This has been reflected in the courts, as cases have been favoring the adoptive familyrather than the surrogate mother in adoption cases. This support suggests that the legislativebranch is behind the social and the judicial system and as the society adjusts, and so there is anobligation for change. There has been a proposed bill in conjunction with the proposed plans thatwould allow for in-country surrogacy regulation, but it is increasingly imperative that it goesthrough and is accepted by the public (El Diario).With the proposed bill, Argentina would reach the requirements for the total socialchange that Dworkin explains within the human rights approach that would show the progressthat Argentina is claiming to have made. Even though this would increase the legal reach, whichEpstein does argue against, it would increase self-ownership and better protect everyone in theHousman 46long run which would conform with the framework that Epstein proposes. Despite the fact thatboth frameworks seem to be contradictory, the leading legal theorists both outline ways in whichthe regulation would be better for the society. The regulation of surrogacy would not only benefitnon-traditional couples but would also benefit heterosexual women who need this as an option.Transgender couples and gender non-conforming women deserve the right to have the fullprotections of being a parent without the demand for the physical contribution that can causeextreme gender dysphoria.  Gender performativity is how cultures shape the definition of genderroles and subsequently the familial roles.  Family is a very important basis of culture inArgentina and this simply reiterates the need for the protection of trans women and gendernon-conforming women’s right to family in the way they see fit. The theory of feminism andqueer studies shows that this is an all encompassing issue and the definition of the need forintersectionality.  Maintaining intersectionality within the movements would improve thepotential for achieving equality and full recognition of reproductive rights for everyone, ratherthan a select few.Conclusion:Equal rights have been a focus for the marginalized people of societies for as long aspeople could have a voice and express it.  Argentina is no exception, and has an equally longhistory of inequality and brave people fighting for what they believed in.  Through the differentpresidencies and leading up to the Dirty War, the women’s movement began to form and fight fortheir rights.  They were not alone, as the LGBTQ+ community also began to form, but theLGBTQ+ community was hit harder during the more repressive and Catholic Church influencedregimes.  The parallel fights intertwined and have become a beacon of intersectionality in LatinHousman 47America.  Their efforts are best shown through the Encuentro Nacional de Mujeres that hasmoved to include gender non-conforming women, trans women, and queer women.  Issues thatwere originally left to be shouldered by one group have been shifted to more shoulders makingthe fight even more seen.Visibility has been extremely important in these fights and the Campaña Nacional Por alDerecho al Aborto Legal Seguro y Gratuito achieved international recognition for their effortsfor reproductive justice.  However, their scope of reproductive rights is limited and has notworked to include the need for a regulation of surrogacy. Surrogacy being unregulated affectscisgender women who want to be surrogates, and queer women and couples who cannot carry achild biologically due to the negative physical or mental complications.  The rights to family ofone’s choosing for non-conforming women, women who are not gender conforming or genderrole conforming, are not being fully protected. Feminist, queer, and legal theory show howimportant this is and how they have been left but also how to continue forward to build a moreinclusive society for all and to continue to move away from the heteronormative matrix that isruling the law.Feminist theory shows the importance of gender within society and the effect that it canhave on activism.  Las Madres shows exactly how important gendered politics are when it comesto the treatment of the people through a repressive government. Their bravery in the face ofuncertainty led to the impressive women’s movement in Argentina that formed the EncuentroNacional de Mujeres and the Campaña Nacional Por el Derecho al Aborto Legal, Seguro yGratuito. The fight for civil rights and reproductive rights leaves the bounds of heteronormativeactivism and naturally crosses into the queer and legal realm when regarding surrogacymotherhood and adoption. The Encuentro Nacional de Mujeres shows the leap into an unchartedHousman 48territory of intersectionality and shines a light on how the future might look with furtherconsideration of multifaceted identities.Queer theory explains exactly why this is important through the concept of genderperformativity and how damaging it can be through gender dysphoria.  Queer studies is stillrelatively new in terms of academia, but it has spread through the world, and Butler’s conceptsare no exception.  Carlos Figari grounds these concepts in an Argentinian frame shaping theunderstanding of why this set of civil rights are so important. It is not enough to just havesurrogacy not illegal for these people that need it. The lack of thought towards why this needexists shows the influence that the patriarchal society and Catholic Church have had on the legalrealm.The application of legal theory on the evaluation of a “social” issue is difficult butnecessary in order to understand the timeline of the change in legal recognition. The fact thatlaws will have to adapt is inevitable, but the timeline and characteristics of the law reflect thecharacteristics of the society. Dynamic and static mentalities surrounding law affects activists'potential impact on change.  The simplicity and complexity of legal decisions affects theapplicability of the law and, in this case, how possible regulating surrogacy is. Simple laws arethought to increase utility of the law and complex laws to limit it.  However, Epstein, whoadvocates for simple laws, also advocates for the increased emphasis on utility for the self.Regulating surrogacy would accomplish this desired goal for Epstein and also Dworkin’s mainpoint of allowing law to change and reflect the morals of the society. Right now, the lack ofregulation maintains that the morals strictly follow those of the Catholic Church, but as thesociety of Argentina is changing, it is increasingly important to recognize this through the law.Housman 49Family ideology is changing and people are beginning to form families that leave thecookie cutter nuclear family model that has been handed down for generations.  By allowingintersectionality in the fight for civil rights between the women’s movement and the LGBTQ+community.  Intersectionality increases the visibility, reach, and potential for change, but it alsodoes increase the amount of people that are affected by this issue. Surrogacy is an incrediblyimportant option for people who are considering a family but can not carry a child to full termthrough their own means. By regulating this necessary option, it would increase the security forthe family and surrogate mother, as well as increase equality in Argentina.  Intersectionalitybetween the feminist movement and LGBTQ+ community has been invaluable for their prioraccomplishments and is vital for equal access to reproductive rights for gender non-conformingwomen and people in Argentina. However, despite the achievements, the rights of sexualcitizenship for the “non-conforming” woman have not been secured fully, and the next stepshould be to fight for their rights to family and surrogacy.Housman 50BibliographyAlma,  Amanda. “Encuentros Nacionales De Mujeres En Argentina: 33 Años De Lucha: NuevaSociedad.” Nueva Sociedad | Democracia y Política En América Latina, 30 Oct. 2018,nuso.org/articulo/encuentros-nacionales-de-mujeres-33-anos-de-lucha/.Arnup, Katherine, and Susan Boyd. “Familial Disputes?: Sperm Donors, Lesbian Mothers, andLegal Parenthood.” Legal Inversions: Lesbians, Gay Men, and the Politics of the Law,edited by Didi Herman and Carl Stychin, Temple University Press, 1995, pp. 77–101.JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bsw19.8.

    "abstract": "Argentina has faced many challenges throughout its history of activism as the people have pushed for an equal society. Different movements have sprung up over the years, but they have begun to twist together in recent times due to the need for support during repressive regimes. This brings into question the concept of intersectionality, which spans feminist, queer, and legal theory in its attempt to explain the need for overlap, modeling the natural development of personal identities and groups like family. The feminist movement and the LGBTQ+ movements have woven together in many rallies, especially during El Encuentro Nacional de Mujeres. In the feminist movement’s focus on reproductive rights, they have left out surrogacy rights and regulation, which is something that the LGBTQ+ community highly values and needs to form their version of family.\nThrough personal experience of the activist scene in Argentina and qualitative research in theory and legal results, it is clear that surrogacy has been left out due to the different treatment of the interests of queer people. It shows that there is a stronghold over the government by the Catholic Church that prevents more equitable legislation that would greatly benefit the LGBTQ+ community in Argentina. The right to family should be protected no matter what considering its importance to full sexual citizenship. Surrogacy is a right that should be properly regulated in order to better protect the right to form a family for everyone equally, including gender non-conforming women and trans women",
