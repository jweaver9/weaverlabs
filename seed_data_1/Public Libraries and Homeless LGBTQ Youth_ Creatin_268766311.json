Concerns about the influences of space, power,human rights, and marginalization informed the researcher and served as critical guides. To gaininsight into this question, one-on-one interviews were conducted with public librarians, serviceproviders who work with homeless youth, and the youth themselves. Grounded theory provideda basis for the analysis of the collected conversations.Six theoretical concepts of time, attitude, building relationships, welcoming, feeling safeand cultural competence, and the two core categories of creating safety and developing culturalcompetence emerged from the data. Out of these, came the final theoretical scheme: In order forthe Library to be able to provide relevant materials and services to the homeless LGBTQ youth,it is necessary for the Library to be perceived as an emotionally safe and welcoming space byboth the youth and the service providers. In addition, the librarians need to feel both physicallyand emotionally safe in providing this space. To create this safety requires shared culturalcompetence between the Library and the other two groups. This theoretical scheme offersguidance to librarians committed to the human rights issue of LGBTQ youth homelessness andinterested in providing appropriate services.Suggestions for future research include extending this research to other cities andlibraries; developing and piloting cultural competence training for all three groups; furtherresearch into existing partnerships between public libraries and service providers for homelessLGBTQ youth; research focusing on public libraries and the lives and needs of homelesstransgender youth, as well as other underserved populations; and, research that examines servicesviito young adults, ages 18 to 24, whose specific needs are not currently being routinely addressedby public libraries.viiiPrefaceIt will be obvious to anyone reading this dissertation where my heart is - I fully supportthe idea of the social responsibilities of public librarians and I consider reaching out to lesbian,gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) homeless youth an act of socialresponsibility. However, I am also aware of the disagreement over this issue and I am willing tohear the reasons for any reluctance to combine social justice and librarianship. Public librariansare severely underappreciated in our society, and along with this underappreciation comesrelatively low salaries, less social capital, and isolation from the larger ideas that challenge oursociety. As a result, few people understand what librarians do and the critical role they play inthe everyday lives of Americans. In addition, this kind of underappreciation can lead to bitternessand an inflexible cleaving to basic rules and policies. Part of my interest in this topic is an effortto show how important public librarians are and how the work they do could be supported andembraced by others who are equally dedicated to their jobs. This kind of collaboration is alreadybeing done on a small scale, here and there, usually without much fanfare but with hearteningresults.The reading and research I have done for this project has changed me, just as returning tograduate school did. I found a quote that seemed to summarize much of what I have experiencedin the past four years in school and in the last two years as I studied this topic. In Geographies ofIdentity and Difference: Marking Boundaries, Pratt (1999) describes Minnie Bruce Pratt’s 1984narrative of travel and discovery: “At the end of the narrative, Pratt is living as a solitary, white,lesbian woman in an African-American neighborhood in Washington DC, choosing thisresidential location, in part, as a vehicle for continuously destabilizing her sense of identity”(p.157). I love this idea of a destabilized identity, because I can see that my identity has shifted -ixit has been destabilized - not just as a librarian, student and researcher, but also as a straightwoman who identifies as a woman and yet has always had questions about the roles andexpectations laid at the feet of females in our society. I would like to shake these loose and havebeen slowly doing that as I continue my research and conversations about gender in particular. Itis challenging to be in between - in two worlds, really - the world I grew up in and the world I’mtrying to become a part of as I shed my expectations.This destabilization has also led to an increased discomfort on my part with thetraditional binary vocabulary of male/female. However, I have been unable to find a workablealternative, although I have certainly spent time looking. There have been - and continue to be -efforts to introduce gender-free pronouns into the English language, but none of them are widelyaccepted. So for the purposes of this research I have chosen to use male or female pronounswhen it is clear the person being discussed identifies that way, and otherwise, as much aspossible, I have chosen to use s/he and hir - thereby probably transferring some of my discomfortto my readers, since on the whole we are a society uncomfortable with gender fluidity orambiguity. But it makes me happy.Finally, I have found in social justice qualitative research the voices I did not know I wasseeking. When I read The Sage Handbook of Qualitative Research, all of the editions, it is as if Iwere invited to a cocktail party, expecting nothing except perhaps excellent cocktails and someentertaining conversations. Instead, I found myself on a picket line, with activists who weredemonstrating for a cause in which I believe. Phrases like “critical theory” and “social action”and words like “margins” and “otherness” provided not only a language for my feelings andideas, but they also gave me peace and the relief of shared concerns.xTable of ContentsChapter One: Introduction and Problem Statement......................................................................1Space and Power

Marginality: who names? whose fringes?…” (Min-Ha, 1991, p.14).“We must create a home for our LGBT youth. This home is an inner and outer dwelling wherelife is understood and respected in a safe place within mainstream culture” (Goldman, 2008,Introduction, p.xxvii).The numbers of homeless youth in the United States are daunting. According to theCenter for American Progress, as of June 21, 2010, there were approximately 1.6 million to 2.8million homeless young people in the United States. Of these, it was estimated that 20 to 40%were lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning (LGBTQ), compared to anestimated 5 to 10% of the overall youth population - obviously a disproportionate number. Thispercentage means that at least 320,000 to 400,000 LGBTQ youth face homelessness each year.This case study was conducted in an effort to understand the role of the public library inthe lives of these youth. Whether or not there was a role was examined, as well as any barriersthat existed. This chapter offers the reasons for this research. They include concerns aboutsocietal attitudes toward space, power, access to information, social exclusion, otherness, thesocial responsibilities of public librarians, human rights and the general lack of knowledge aboutwhat a public library offers to its community. All of these were identified as potential barriers tomeaningful library access for the homeless LGBTQ youth in this study. These beginningconcerns are what Charmaz (2006) called “sensitizing concepts that address such concepts as2power, global reach, and difference” (p.133). This research used the inductive analyses ofgrounded theory to highlight the connections between the case study at hand and these largersocietal concerns.Space and PowerSpace and power play significant roles in the lives of homeless LGBTQ youth. Spacebecause we all occupy space and yet how we occupy it, how it is built to allow us to occupy itand how welcome we are in that space are all part of the hegemony of our society. Hou (2010)described this when he said: “By delineating what constitutes public and private and bydesignating membership to specific social norms, the official public sphere has long beenexclusionary” (p.3).  Power because those who make decisions about the use of the space and theattendant materials and resources that may come along with it, such as in a public library, areaffected by the power structure that mandates what is acceptable and what is not. Wilchins(2002b) alluded to this power when describing being genderqueer in a heterosexual society: “It’sabout power. By creating notions of realness and dividing bodies along a binary of real/false,bodies like mine are kept disempowered” (p.41).The status quo in the United States is adulthood, heterosexuality and being safelydomiciled in a way that allows the privileged to lead their private lives in private. To live outsideof this sphere is to be judged or at least gauged for worthiness and acceptance. In Geographies ofExclusion, Sibley (1995) described the attitudes of those who designed space with a particularpopulation in mind:There is a connection between the function and design of the space as determined bycommercial interests and design professionals, architects and planners, and theconstruction of one group of the population as ‘deviant’, out of place, and threatening the3projected image of the development. (Introduction, p.xii)However, this connection is subtle. This is not a targeted and malicious campaign toostracize those who are left out of the mainstream. It is, instead, a relative positioning that allowsthose in power, whether they know it or not, to impose their values on others, just as those valueswere imposed on them. Bourdieu (1998) alluded to this when he described the social space andhis principles of differentiation:Social space is constructed in such a way that agents or groups are distributed accordingto their position in statistical distributions based on the two principles of differentiation,which in the most advanced societies, such as the United States…are undoubtedly themost efficient: economic capital and cultural capital. It follows that all agents are locatedin space in such a way that the closer they are to one another in those two dimensions, themore they have in common; and the more remote they are from one another, the less theyhave in common. (p.7)In public libraries, the effects of these distributions are clearly demonstrated by thearchitecture of the building, the displays and interior design, the materials and resources offered,the public conduct policies and the library staff themselves. Many American public libraries aredesigned to accommodate and serve a domiciled, able-bodied, heterosexual, English-speaking,Christian and literate public, capable of reading the signs, using the computers, staying awake,arriving showered and well-fed, and interested primarily in the programs and materials thatsupport their domiciled family lives. It should not be a surprise that public libraries are like thisbecause they are created, supported and staffed by those who belong to this same group, who areclose together in that social space and who recognize each other. But even those who fall outside4of the limited group, such as gay and lesbian librarians, are still swayed by the power outside ofthemselves. As Bourdieu (1998) explained:Domination is not the direct and simple action exercised by a set of agents (“thedominant class”) invested with powers of coercion. Rather, it is the indirect effect ofa complex set of actions engendered within the network of intersecting constraints whicheach of the dominants, thus dominated by the structure of the field through whichdomination is exerted, endures on behalf of all the others. (p.34)One result of domination is the social exclusion of various groups of people, in this case,homeless LGBTQ youth. The impact social exclusion has on this group has been welldocumented by those who have observed and interviewed them, and includes risky behavior, lowself-esteem, suicide ideation and depression. These characteristics match well with thedescription by Hutchison, Abrams and Christian (2007), when they described the effects of beingsocially excluded:Exclusion challenges people’s fundamental need to belong to a social unit. It causes anumber of dysfunctional reactions including lowered self-esteem, greater anger, inabilityto reason well, depression and anxiety, and self-defeating perceptions and behaviors.Being excluded also evokes antisocial and aggressive responses, most likely because ofthe threat it poses to people’s need for control. Other responses are more passive andinclude withdrawal or self-harm, whereas more constructive responses include tryingharder to engage with the majority or conforming more strongly to relevant norms. (p.29)Ironically, homeless LGBTQ youth, unlike visibly homeless adults, are able to “pass” asdomiciled and perhaps even straight or gender-conforming. For instance, passing as domiciled5was one of the goals of Cedar, a homeless gay teenager. Cedar explained that, even though heloved using the Library, he did not go every day:Um, just because like, that’s my biggest thing, you know I shower every day, brush myteeth every day, try to have good hygiene, you know, try to look presentable, but if yousee me on a day-to-day, day-to-day basis it’s hard, because like, I wear the same thing. SoI try not to come here [the Library] every day, um, every few days and, um, so I would Iwould be surprised if anybody here knew I was homeless.The ability to pass allows LGBTQ homeless youth to find sanctuary in a library or other publicspace away from the rigors of street life, but it also adds to their isolation by effectively hidingtheir identities.In addition, this invisibility also makes it extremely challenging for those outside theirsocial sphere, such as the public librarians, to provide relevant and critical resources. The youthand the librarians are at cross-purposes: The youth are hiding who they are and the librariansneed to know more so they can offer help. The irony of this is that although in some ways thispassing makes their lives more tolerable, in the long run it contributes to their exclusion, notsimply by keeping them hidden, but also by becoming part of that “complex set of actions” thatallows for the domination and resulting disparities to exist.For many of these young people, it was a lack of invisibility that led to their lives on thestreet in the first place. According to some sources, as many as 40% of LGBTQ youth who eithercome out or are outed to their parents or caretakers are kicked out of their homes. This statisticcertainly gives them an increased hesitancy to reveal themselves again. The impact of this kindof rejection puts them even more at risk, as Hutchison et al. (2007) pointed out:6Among the people Durkheim identified as being most at risk [of suicide] are those thatare extremely individuated, have limited linkages to family and community, areperceived as misfits, are alienated, and/or suffer from thwarted opportunities…Incontrast, strong family ties (Compton, Thompson & Kaslow, 2005)…[are] associatedwith a sense of belonging or connectedness, which can buffer negative thought processesand self-defeating behaviors.” (p.35)Homeless LGBTQ youth are extremely individuated, by their sexual orientation orgender identity and by their very homelessness. Their linkages to family are, in many cases,stretched or severed, leaving them without the sanctuary of home. They are misfits in manyways, again by sexual orientation or gender identity and, as many cases have shown, they havebeen murdered for their differences. Their power and their voices have become muted.Social exclusion can emerge from the concept of “otherness” - being different from whatis considered the norm. Mallon and Woronoff (2006) discussed the concept of other in relation toLGBTQ youth:As long as LGBT children, youth, and families are viewed as a “them,” the burden fallson LGBT persons to do all the work necessary for sound gender and sexual orientationrelations. Traditionally, in American society, the members of oppressed, marginalizedgroups are expected to stretch out and bridge the chasm between the actualities of theirlives and the consciousness of those whom oppress them. LGBT persons are frequentlyexpected to educate the heterosexual world about their lives. This expectation permitsthose who subjugate LGBT children, youth, and families to maintain their positions ofpower and evade responsibility for their own actions. The implications of this approach is7that only a certain American can define what it means to be American - and the rest mustsimply “fit in.” (p.121)Train, a caseworker at the Phoenix Resource Center (PRC), one of the Juniper YouthServices (JYS) drop-in sites, reiterated this idea, when asked about increasing culturalcompetence among professionals - like doctors and librarians - who work with people whoidentify as transgender. S/he explained:I don’t feel like it’s very appropriate to be learning about a population through thatpopulation themselves as they’re coming in.  I feel like it’s really important to learn aboutthat themselves, so, to read books, and to get to know people who are trans, not just forthe purpose of, you know, educating themselves, but knowing people who are trans so asto demystify it as being this othering experience for them, like this unknown.  It’s likepeople are just normal like everyone, you know.  Normal with their, whatever problemsthey might have.This idea is explored further in Chapter Two, in the discussion of the heteronormativeattitudes of society and in Chapter Five, with the discussion of cultural alterity and the role itplays in this topic.Why Public LibrariesOne could ask why public librarians should be concerned about a group that chooses toremain invisible and certainly represents a small percentage of the population they serve. Oneway to understand is to examine the relationship between human rights and public libraries.Amnesty International (2012) defined human rights as: “Basic rights and freedoms that allpeople are entitled to regardless of nationality, sex, national or ethnic origin, race, religion,language, or other status.” These basic freedoms and rights should apply to the approximately8400,000 homeless LGBTQ youth in the United States, yet these rights are abridged by theirpoverty, their youth, their lack of social and family support, and their willingness to live outsidethe expected gender norms.In their article “Human Rights and Librarians,” Phenix and de la Peña McCook (2005)explore and explain the connection between this idea and public libraries: “Librarians have longbeen aware of the many ways human rights values intersect with the values of ourprofession…Human rights values permeate library policies beyond the professional round tablesinhabited by intellectual freedom, social responsibility, and international relations” (p.24).These two authors and many more have been active in creating a convincing discourse on theresponsibilities of public libraries as social actors in a world that can seem tilted toward thehaves versus the have-nots.However, as public libraries continue to espouse the idea of responding to the statedneeds of their communities, it is easy to see why the idea of creating programs and providingresources to a small voiceless group could be ignored. So it is important to also remember thatone of the basic tenets of librarianship is to aim toward a goal of access for all, with a nod towardthe democratic nature of public libraries. This was described in the American LibraryAssociation’s Policy 61, which provided suggestions for ways libraries could help those who arestruggling in society. The introduction to the policy was as follows:The American Library Association promotes equal access to information for all persons,and recognizes the urgent need to respond to the increasing number of poor children,adults, and families in America. These people are affected by a combination oflimitations, including illiteracy, illness, social isolation, homelessness, hunger, anddiscrimination, which hamper the effectiveness of traditional library services. Therefore it9is crucial that libraries recognize their role in enabling poor people to participate fully ina democratic society, by utilizing a wide variety of available resources and strategies.Concrete programs of training and development are needed to sensitize and preparelibrary staff to identify poor people’s needs and deliver relevant services. And within theAmerican Library Association the coordinating mechanisms of programs and activitiesdealing with poor people in various divisions, offices, and units should be strengthened,and support for low-income liaison activities should be enhanced. (ALA, 2010)It is worth noting the words “traditional library service” in this description, because thosethree words lie at the heart of the discomfort many librarians feel in dealing with those outsidetheir comfort zones. The word traditional, in particular, seems to highlight differences betweenthose who are easily served and those who may not be served as well. The implication is thatlibrarians must step outside the role they are used to and help those who have been, due to theirown limitations, excluded from the “normal” library services, thereby supporting the notion of“other.”In addition, information itself is a powerful tool and those who are unable to access it in ameaningful way are rendered powerless and voiceless. In her discussion of social justiceresearch, Charmaz (2005) stated: “…Present, partial, or absent resources…influence interactionsand outcomes. Such resources include information…Thus, information and power are crucialresources…” (p.513). Homelessness in particular can make information inaccessible, particularlyin public libraries, where barriers to access can include being required to have a permanentaddress.Historically, there has been - and continues to be - a struggle in the library world betweenthose librarians who would “accept our moral responsibility to commit ourselves to social and10political issues such as war, poverty and racism” (Nelson, 1987, p. 131), and those whochallenge this idea of “too much emphasis on social issues” and who are “looking for a place togo that deals with their concerns within the library world” (personal communication, November2, 2009). Using long interviews and grounded theory, this research offers an opportunity to hearthe voices of the librarians who struggle with the concept of human rights, social responsibilityand librarianship, and the challenges of balancing their daily responsibilities against the needs ofan almost invisible population. In addition, by using interviews with the professionals who workwith homeless youth, as well as the homeless youth themselves, it provides background on theneeds of these youth and the ways in which these librarians could play a part in meeting theseneeds if they so chose.What the Public Library MeansOne final barrier to the use of the public library by the homeless LGBTQ youth was thedearth of knowledge about the Library. The conversations with the service providers and thehomeless LGBTQ youth made it clear they did not understand what the Library could offer.Throughout the research, there were numerous epiphanies about this topic. One particularlyenlightening exchange was with the previously mentioned caseworker, Train. S/he made hirselfavailable twice and the interviews with hir provided valuable insight into the lives of thehomeless youth, the work of the service providers and any intersections with the Library.However, when asked whether or not it would be useful for the City Library to offer access to alist of doctors who were culturally competent about transgender issues, s/he was confused. Afterbeing offered an explanation that included the example of a librarian offering a list of retirementhomes to a patron seeking one for a parent, Train responded: “Oh, sure.  That would be great.  Itsounds like the library is more than just books, then.  It’s more like a resource center?” [Italics11added for emphasis] It was moments like this that underscored the importance of this research.Train was an important intermediary between the youth and the services they sought. Without aclear understanding from hir about what the City Library could offer, s/he would not be sendingthem there to ask questions or to look for resources. The meaning s/he attached to the word“library” affected not only hir, but the youth and even the librarians, because the librariansneeded to know about their communities - who they were, what they needed and how they wereable to receive library services.Finally, it is hoped the insights provided will help public librarians and those who supportpublic libraries to understand the complexities of addressing the ongoing needs of a group thatfalls outside the normal service expectations. How public librarians choose to use their powerand their spaces is a topic that has myriad applications for the future of public libraries and istherefore worthy of this close examination.12Chapter 2Literature Review“Surviving queer, no matter how invisible, often requires knowing how to travel across hostileterritory - whether it be physical, emotional, cultural or theoretical” (Ingram, 1997, p.27)The topic of LGBTQ youth homelessness and public libraries is a complex one. Thischapter reviews the literature that helps to tell this story. It provides insight into LGBTQ youth,homelessness, statistics, vocabulary, public libraries, public spaces and the social responsibilitiesof librarians. It highlights ways public libraries are already providing the kinds of resources usedby this population. It is only by bringing together these disparate parts can there be anunderstanding of the role of public libraries in the lives of homeless LGBTQ youth.LGBTQ YouthOne way to approach the topic of LGBTQ homeless youth is to begin with a descriptionof LGBTQ youth themselves, including the challenges they face in a society that has been slowto accept those outside what could be called the norm. As mentioned in Chapter One, LGBTQyouth - and adults - have historically been considered as “other” in a society that is reluctant toaccept and embrace differences. This othering and the effect it has on youth in particular plays alarge part in the lives of the LGBTQ homeless youth, and some understanding of what it meansand how it happens may help to shed light on the challenges they face every day.Vocabulary. A vocabulary lesson offers an introduction to this subject, since many of theterms that are used may not be clear to those who are unaccustomed to them. It is also worthnoting many of the books and articles that address the topic of LGBTQ youth include a glossary(see Appendix A for an example of such a glossary). The fact this seems necessary can perhapsgive insight into the lack of information that exists for the librarians and any others who are13engaged in helping this group. As Mallon (2010) pointed out, “there is a constantly changingargot” (p.13); however becoming familiar and comfortable with some of the terms currently inuse will be a first step toward greater understanding and acceptance.Gender and sex, in particular, need to be defined as clearly as possible, since they arefrequently used interchangeably. Gender, which is not the same as sex, is not biological, it issocial. According to Marksamer, Spade and Arkles (2011):  “Gender identity or core genderrefers to a person’s internal, deeply felt sense of being male or female” (p.10). As explained inthe Sacramento State Pride Center Ally Training Manual (2010), “Gender Identity is a person’ssense of their own gender, which is communicated to others by their Gender Expression. Sincemost people conform to societal gender norms, they have a Gender Identity congruent with theirgender Expression” (“Gender Variance,” p.19). Namaste (2000) used the term transgender as anumbrella term, referring to “all individuals whose gendered self-presentation (evidenced throughdress, mannerisms, and even physiology) does not correspond to the behaviors habituallyassociated with the members of their biological sex” (p.1).A transgender girl or transwoman is a person whose assigned birth sex was male but whounderstands herself to be female and desires to live her life as a girl or woman. A transgenderboy or transman is a person whose assigned birth sex was female but who understands himself tobe male and desires to live his life as a boy or man. Transgender people may begin to understandor publicly express their core gender at various points in their lives, from as young as age threeor four to elderly and everywhere in between. Many transgender people have medical treatmentsto change their physical bodies to better match their core gender but not all. Some people aregender fluid - their gender expressions fall aside of the stereotypes society has created aboutbeing male or female and they do not consistently identify with either one. Being gender non-14conforming, transgender, gender fluid, gender queer or any of the other terms that are used, doesnot say anything about a person’s sexual orientation, since people who are gender non-conforming can be gay, lesbian, bisexual, heterosexual or asexual.Sex, unlike gender, is biological - a person’s sex is a reflection of his or her sexual organsand the majority of people can be described as male or female. However, about one in 2,000babies are born with a sexual or reproductive anatomy and/or chromosome pattern that is nottypically male or female. People who fall into this category - and there are many variations onthis - are currently called intersex, to replace the obsolete and offensive term hermaphrodite.None of the participants in this study identified themselves as intersex, but it is worth brieflymentioning the topic, since people who are intersex also experience social exclusion,misunderstandings and mistreatment. As explained on the Intersex Australia website:Our differences are the subject of constant erasure by a society that harbors a deephomophobic fear, even hatred, of our biology. We are the subjects of constant medicalexperimentation that has the primary aim of eliminating our differences from the ways itis possible to be human.This kind of social exclusion, much of it based on a lack of accurate information, appliesto sexual minorities in general. While youth who are intersex or who identify as gendernonconforming, such as transgender, have an increased risk of being ostracized, LGBTQ youthwho identify as bisexual, lesbian, gay or even asexual are also likely to feel out of place in abinary, heterosexist culture. In their research with 748 Australian teenagers who identified asLGBTQ, Hillier and Harrison (2004) found that:All of the young people expressed that their sexual feelings were regarded as perverse intheir culture…Over half had been verbally and/or physically abused because of their15sexuality and, unlike information about heterosexual safe sex, less than one in ten hadbeen able to access information about gay and lesbian safe sex from schools or thefamily. (p.82)Namaste (2000) gave practical examples of the challenges facing transgendered people intheir daily lives. She pointed out that “very few of the monographs, articles and books writtenabout us deal with the nitty-gritty realities of our lives, our bodies, and our experience of theeveryday world” (p.1). Her examples included finding a doctor; electrolysis; looking for a job;losing a lover; perfecting the art of binding breasts; trying to get a date; visiting the hospital;attending funerals; and, obtaining legal documents (p.2). Participants at the 2011 LGBTQIAA(Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual and Allies) WesternRegional Conference in Berkeley, California, echoed these kinds of experiences and issues.Conversations in one workshop centered on such topics as where to get hormones (PlannedParenthood), losing lovers after transitioning, and whether or not to have “top” surgery (doubleincision or bilateral mastectomy). The kind of practical information that was exchanged in thisworkshop gave insight into the real lives of these real people, away from gender theories oracademic jargon (personal communication, March 5, 2011). As Namaste (2000) put it:These are the activities of our day-to-day, the fabric of how our bodies are located in, andmove through, the world. Although banal, these events merit consideration: anything lessproduces a knowledge of little practical relevance to our lives, reinforcing a world thattreats transsexual and transgendered people as inconsequential. (p.2)The next section offers some statistics as one way to gain insight into the challengesfaced by LGBTQ youth. But it is important to point out two aspects of the picture created bythese numbers that need to be emphasized. First, sexual minority youth are put at risk by the16behavior of others, not themselves. That is, it is a lack of acceptance that makes them avulnerable population, not their sexual orientations or gender identities. As with other kinds ofbigotry and intolerance, the root causes lie in societal attitudes. These youth are homeless notbecause they are LGBTQ, but because their identities were found unacceptable. As one homelessteen pointed out in the series of videos produced by Moennig (2008): “I’m only at risk becausesociety puts me at risk.”  Or as Warwick, a teenager in Hillier and Harrison’s (2004) studyexplained, when asked about the way society looks at his sexuality: “Society makes it not greatso I don’t feel great. If society accepted it, I would feel great (Warwick, 15 years)” (p.89).Wilchins (2002a) addressed this same issue when describing the daily impact of beinggenderqueer:As a system of meanings in which we participate each day, gender also feels exquisitelypersonal. So when someone gender-bashes or gender-baits us, we think, It’s my ownfault. If only I were more butch, if only I were more femme, if only I were taller, shorter,slimmer, heavier, had smaller breasts or larger muscles…if only I’d dressed or acted orfelt differently, this never would have happened to me. We blame ourselves and so we tryto change ourselves. (p.14)Second, it is important to acknowledge that even though some statistics may give insightinto the lives of these youth, it is critical to pull away from the idea they are victims. Driver(2008) expressed this beautifully:When queer youth are included within educational, psychological, and social scienceliterature, their marginalized social status is often emphasized in ways that construct themas victims…The negative effects of subordination become the focal point of research inwhich queer youth are defined reactively against the dominant systems and denied17the chance to exceed hegemonic discursive influences. (p.3)A good example of the language and descriptions that are used for LGBTQ youth is aquote from a 2002 article in the American Journal of Public Health. In the introduction to theirstudy of the challenges faced by homeless sexual minorities, the authors offered this paragraph:Among adolescents in general, GLBT youths are more vulnerable to health andpsychological problems than are heterosexual youths. Many are victims of parentalphysical abuse, are substance abusers, and have both mental and general physical healthproblems. These problems may be amplified for GLBT youths who become homeless.(Cochran, Stewart, Ginzler and Cauce, p.773)While the information presented in this introduction is probably accurate and fitswell with much of the offerings related to the lives of LGBTQ youth, it is also clear the repeateduse of descriptions like this without any ameliorating language can present a view of thispopulation that is disempowering and one-dimensional. In keeping with the sentiment expressedby Driver (2008), it is essential to balance the reality of the lives of LGBTQ youth, in particularthose who are homeless, with the knowledge that each one of these young people is unique. Anyeffort to normalize them or to create the impression that only by fitting in will they be able toflourish as individuals must be carefully examined and, one hopes, rejected. As Driver pointedout, “Even the most well-meaning attempts to help queer youth often fall prey to patronizingefforts to impose healthy ‘normative’ ideals in order to simplify their complexities for the sake ofmainstream recognition” (p.5). For LGBTQ homeless youth this is doubly true, since there is anequal pressure on people who are experiencing homelessness to behave properly and in a sociallyacceptable manner so they can be tolerated or even incorporated into the mainstream.18Conversely, acknowledging one’s identity and making it visible can create theopportunity to be powerful and free of stigma. Shelton (2008) expressed it like this:Before a person can identify oneself outwardly as a member of a community, s/he mustbe able to comfortably identify and accept oneself inwardly as a valuableindividual…When shame is stripped from one’s identity, s/he feels worthy of a voice andclaims the power to use that voice. (p.81)Part of this identity process includes choosing a name or description that feelscomfortable and appropriate. Terms such as genderqueer, genderneutral, pansexual, omnisexualand gender fluid reflect the creativity and freedom to self-describe. Cedar, one of the homelessyouth in this case study, called himself “gay, genderqueer and pansexual,” because he did notidentify with the stereotypical views of either males or sexual orientation in our society.These terms can be contrasted with the word cisgender, which is not regularly used bythose who can be so identified. The Sacramento State Pride Center (2010a) defined cisgender as:“A gender identity that society considers to match the biological sex assigned at birth. The prefixcis- means on this side of or not across from. A term used to call attention to the privilege ofpeople who are not transgendered” (p.8). This act of giving a name to the dominant cultureserves as a way of creating parity between the majority and minority and thereby lessening thestigma attached to identifying as outside a majority view. That is, both groups are identified,moving away from the idea that the minority only exists as a negative of the majority. By usingthe term cisgender, gender rather than transgender becomes the focus, thereby weakening thepower of those who might see someone who is transgender as deviant. One could say this kind ofnaming helps to re-define the center and creates an altogether different kind of picture. An19illustration of this could be a bicycle wheel, in which the hub is simply the word gender and thespokes all lead to variations on that word.Keeping all of this in mind, a picture can be created that will help create an awareness ofthe challenges faced by these youth. The statistics can serve as not a description or summary oftheir lives, but instead as indicators of the work society in general needs to do to reduce the risksto LGTBQ homeless youth and to allow each one of them to be proud of who they are and whatthey can contribute.The numbers. A good place to start for statistics is PFLAG - Parents, Families andFriends of Lesbians and Gays and Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning People. As indicatedby their name, this nationwide organization provides education and support for parents, familiesand friends of those who identify as LGBTQ. The Phoenix chapter of PFLAG offers aninformation sheet called “Today’s Gay Youth: The Ugly, Frightening Statistics” (n.d.). Someexamples included:• Suicide is the leading cause of death among gay and lesbian youth.• Approximately 28% of gay and lesbian youth drop out of high school because ofdiscomfort (due to verbal and physical abuse) in the school environment.• Gay students hear anti-gay slurs as often as 26 times each day; faculty intervention occursin only about 3% of those cases.• Gays and lesbians are the most frequent victims of hate crimes.• Approximately 40% of homeless youth are identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual.• In a study of male teenagers self-described as gay or bisexual, 27% moved away fromhome because of conflict with family members over sexual orientation. About half hadrun away at least once.20The last two bullet points are examples of the many statistics and stories about homelessLGBTQ youth. The next section addresses this issue in particular. However, before moving on,one more point needs to be made and that is the idea of defining a group of people by what theyare not or do not have. As an outgrowth of a society that seems focused on housing status andheterosexuality, it is important to highlight the ways in which many descriptions of the out-groups are based not on their strengths but on their perceived lacks. For example, a person whois experiencing homelessness is someone who is defined by not having a home or a person whoidentifies as gay or lesbian is defined by not being straight. This tendency to create whatWilchins (2002b) called a “binary” is about power. As Wilchins put it:It should surprise no one that binaries are about power, a form of doing politics throughlanguage. Binaries create the smallest possible hierarchy of one thing over another. Theyare not really about two things, but only one…The second term of a binary exists only tosupport the first term. Thus Woman functions not as an equal half but as a support andprop, derivative and dependent on Man. So both terms of the binary are really about thefirst.  (pp.43-44)It is difficult to get around this use of language because this research is about thesebinaries; in particular, youth/adult, queer/straight and homeless/domiciled. But it is hoped anawareness of this power dynamic will soften the impact of accepting these constructs andpossibly provide much-needed insight into ways in which they can be deconstructed andchallenged.21Homelessness“I’m one of y’all” (Homeless focus group participant, when asked what he wanted librarians toknow about him)A homeless person can be defined as someone “who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequatenight-time residence” (PBS, 2009). It is difficult to know how many people in the United Statesfall into this category, since “as a result of methodological and financial constraints, most studiesare limited to counting people who are in shelters or on the streets” (National Coalition for theHomeless, 2009). However, according to the “National Law Center on Homelessness &Poverty,” each year more than 3 million people experience homelessness. Much research hasbeen done on this topic, in the United States and elsewhere. In fact, all large urban areas aretrying to cope with the challenges of providing services and housing to people who areexperiencing homelessness.The biggest needs are employment and affordable housing, in conjunction with health,safety and security issues. The housing itself requires yet another a vocabulary lesson, since thereare terms that form the basis for serving the needs of those who are experiencing homelessness.The basic terms include those used for describing people who are homeless, as well as describinghousing and services that may or may not be available.Vocabulary. The first term is chronic homelessness, which is federally defined as:either (1) an unaccompanied homeless individual with a disabling condition who hasbeen continuously homeless for a year or more, OR (2)  an unaccompanied individualwith a disabling condition who has had at least four episodes of homelessness in the pastthree years. (HUD, 2007)22This term refers to a homeless adult but adulthood can start at 18, so this applied to a percentageof the homeless youth served by JYS. “Throwaway youth” is another term that can apply to thispopulation. This term is defined as:A term used to describes two types of circumstance: 1) A child who is asked or told toleave home by a parent or other household adult, without adequate alternative care beingarranged for the child by a household adult, and with the child out of the householdovernight; or 2) A child who is away from home and is prevented from returning homeby a parent or other household adult, without adequate alternative care being arranged forthe child by a household adult, and the child is out of the household overnight. (NRCDV,2011)Besides the terms used to describe the youth themselves, there is also a vocabulary thatpertains to housing. Included in this are affordable housing, emergency housing, transitionalhousing and supportive housing. Because the youth are accessing or trying to access variouskinds of housing, it is important to define these terms. The American Library AssociationToolkit, titled “Extending Our Reach: Reducing Homelessness Through Library Engagement”(American Library Association, 2012) offers definitions for these and other phrases that are usedin the world of homeless youth and homelessness in general. These definitions are offered inAppendix B.There are other terms that relate to the interactions between the social services and theseyouth. Included in these are: Continuum of care, case management, harm reduction andcaseworker. Definitions for these terms are also in Appendix B. These terms, especiallycaseworker, transitional and emergency housing and harm reduction are ones that havereoccurred over the course of this research. They are the language of homelessness and it is23difficult not to consider the importance of this new vocabulary for these youth. When one comesfrom a stable, loving and accepting home, these words are unnecessary, because their meaningsare built into the structure of the environment. Housing is permanent - there is no need foremergency or transitional housing. A parent is the caseworker - providing emergency assistance,advocacy and the myriad other duties willingly and appropriately offered up in the course of ayoung person’s life growing up. Harm reduction is just another way of saying “We accept youfor who you are” and these are words that should be on the lips of every parent. The need for thisvocabulary lesson offers insight into another world, where assumptions have been left far behindand where these young people need to speak an unnatural but necessary tongue as they strive tomake their way. It is part of their education as they learn about the culture of homelessness.Social exclusion. In addition, there is the stigma of living outside what is considerednormal. As described in Chapter One, the feelings of being stigmatized and socially excludedplay a large role in a person’s emotional and mental attitudes. According to Mason-Whiteheadand Mason (2007):Stigma has its roots in individual and group ‘differences.’ The pain and emotional hurtexperienced by the stigmatized person is linked to others’ pity, fear, disgust anddisapproval of this difference, whether the difference is one of personality, physicalappearance, illness and disability, age, gender or sexuality. (p.60)For the homeless LGBTQ youth, the “difference” is primarily that of gender andsexuality, although being a teenager in American society can carry its own stigma. Mason-Whitehead and Mason (2007) summed up the impact of this social exclusion and stigmatizing,by pointing out that  “the impact of stigma and social exclusion can be devastating, leading tolow self-esteem, poor social relationships, isolation, depression and self-harm” (p.60). These24outcomes mirror the earlier descriptions of LGBTQ adolescents, both domiciled and homeless. Itis necessary to mention again that these bleak descriptions present only the challenging aspect ofthe lives of queer homeless youth - these youth are not defined by these characteristics.Clapham (2007) stressed that homelessness may be a consequence of social exclusion, aswell as a cause. He made the connection between social exclusion and the disadvantages thatcome out of social exclusion. As he said: “It is clear that social disadvantage is onepredisposition of homelessness. Of course, this does not mean that all disadvantaged peoplebecome homeless and there needs to be a trigger that impacts on the housing situation” (p.83).One of the triggers he mentioned is “ a young person being thrown out of the family home”(p.83), an apt description of many of the youth being described in this research.Another point that is frequently made about homelessness is the dichotomy of choiceversus societal influences. Clapham (2007) described this dichotomy as the minimalist discourseversus the maximalist discourse. Implicit within the minimalist discourse is that homelessness iscaused by the “personal shortcomings of the homeless people themselves,” while the maximalistdiscourse lays the cause of homelessness at the feet of societal forces, such as governmentagencies (p.81). These two attitudes are pervasive - it is not uncommon to hear a member of thedomiciled public either supporting or blaming a homeless person for their homeless status. In herarticle about homelessness and social exclusion, Walsh (2006) gave insight into this:The notion that social exclusion results from the moral failure of the individual seemspopular within the community…In Australia, the idleness, precarious moral status andfraudulent tendencies of the excluded are commonly cited by the federal government tojustify the expansion of mutual obligation requirements…Ultimately, blame falls on the25excluded themselves, who are said to have failed to include themselves in social life.(p.195)The idea of failing to include oneself in social life can also be applied to LGBTQ youth.The assumption made by many people, especially in regards to transgender youth (and adults) isthat this change is by choice and not because aligning one’s physical self with one’s gender is anatural step for any person. Both of these attitudes are good examples of the challenge of beingboth homeless and LGBTQ in a society with a deep skepticism and intolerance toward those whodo not conform. It is critical to keep this in mind when examining the status of LGBTQ homelessyouth in a domiciled and predominantly straight society.Yet another aspect of being homeless is that people who are homeless have to live muchof their lives in the open. As Mitchell (1995) put it: “For those who are always in the public,private activities must necessarily be carried out publicly” (p.118). As a result, they are punishedfor performing private acts in public and this “situates homeless people in a highly vulnerableposition of being everywhere while permitted to be nowhere” (Dooling, 2009, p.622). This onceagain reinforces the binary, between citizens and what Dooling called “outlaws,” those who arenot proper citizens (p.623). One outcome of this punitive attitude is that the legal constraintshomeless people encounter in public spaces emphasize who is considered a legitimate citizen -the domiciled - and who isn’t (Dooling, 2009). This concept is further developed in the latersection on space.Home. It is not possible to talk about homelessness without examining the concept ofhome. The oft-quoted Frost (1915) quote: “Home is the place where, when you have to gothere,/They have to take you in,” sums up much of what home can represent to anyone, includingLGBTQ youth. The idea of home as sanctuary can seem obvious to those who have experienced26just such homes. Home in those cases offers more than shelter. As Neale (2003) explained: “It isassociated with material conditions and standards, privacy, space, control, personal warmth,comfort, stability, safety, security, choice, self-expression, and physical and emotional well-being” (Watson and Austerberry, 1986, as quoted in Neale). Home, too, offers not just thesematerial conditions, but also status. To be domiciled is to be socially acceptable and to have thepower, however weak it may be, that society gives those who are domiciled and withholds fromthose who aren’t. As Neale (2003) pointed out: “Potent social forces do exist and being homelessis to lose a stake in several of them” (p.46).However, home can be a nightmare for some. Physical and emotional abuse, brought onby poverty, substance abuse or a discomfort with the sexual orientation or gender identificationof the LGBTQ youth, can transform home into house and house into a place that offers nosanctuary at all. For LGBTQ youth, losing a home and become homeless is not the sameexperience as it is for adults. These youth lose not just a house but they lose in addition thefeeling of acceptance and love that come from family, however family has manifested itself intheir lives. For some LGBTQ youth, Frost (1915) is simply wrong: When you have to go there,they do not have to take you in, and if you are already there, they may tell you to leave.In addition, the heterogeneity of those who are experiencing homelessness must beemphasized. As DeVerteuil, May and von Mahs (2009) asserted: “Rather than continue to talk of‘the’ homeless, we would suggest the need to develop a more nuanced understanding of a variedhomeless population and therefore of the quite different experiences of homelessness within thecontemporary city” (p.650). Although this research looked at homelessness, it was not simplybeing without a home for this group. It was instead a state of being ejected from a place thatmeans home in the most basic way. There is no term for this difference and it is challenging to27find one that encompasses the triad of the pain of rejection, the physicality of being alone and theabsolute strength and courage required to re-find home. The binary is prevalent here, as there isonly a term for the loss and not for the depth of reality that exists for each of these young people.Homeless LGBTQ youth. “No one ever told me that being strong is by starting fromnowhere and having nothing” (Cupid & Dija, 2010).According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness (2010), “unaccompaniedhomeless youth are defined as youth ages 12 to 24 with no familial support or permanentresidency.” In addition: “The number one reason that GLBT youth become homeless is familyconflict,” often created by the teen’s disclosure of sexual orientation ((Henderson, 2007). Ray(2006), too, gave insight into this by pointing out that: “According to one study, 50 percent ofgay males experienced a negative parental reaction when they came out and 26 percent of thosedisclosures were met with a demand that the youth leave home” (p.16).Once the youth are on the streets, their lives can be challenging. As Ray (2006)explained, homeless LGBTQ youth “typically sleep in shelters, public spaces, abandonedbuildings, cars, or outside…and some will be exploited by adults and exchange sex for a place tostay.” Or, as Shawndelle, a young lesbian in the film We Are…GLBTQ (Children’sAdministration, n.d.) said: “…You get the strong sense that nobody really wants you - thatyou’re not good enough to have around.” This film used interviews with LGBTQ youth and theadults who care about them to provide insight into this topic and it joined a range of articles,books and videos that delve into the lives of homeless LGBTQ youth. Included in theseresources were heart-wrenching stories of the lives of these youth, as they struggled on thestreets, creating new lives and new families for themselves. For instance, the anthology KickedOut by Lowery (2010) provided insight into their thoughts, experiences and successes as they28navigated their way toward safer lives. As Lowery explained in the introduction, the anthologywas created because “we can no longer pretend we cannot hear the tears of the youth who havelost their friends, families and homes because of whom they love or how they define theirgender” (p.15).Much of the literature about homeless LGBTQ youth is included in the closely related topicof LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care. These youth may be in foster homes, shelters or even inthe juvenile justice system. What they all have in common is an inability to live at home, for amultitude of reasons. In some cases, the homes they have left have been foster homes, whereagain their sexual or gender identity are not considered acceptable. Many of these youth wereverbally and physically abused in foster care, group homes and even in homeless shelters. So it isfrequently safer to live on the streets than to be in either foster care or in a shelter, particularly anadult shelter.Voices from the Street: A Survey of Homeless Youth by Their Peers (2008) provided a broadrange of insights into the lives of homeless youth. Since up to 40% of these youth identified asLGBTQ, many of the comments and suggestions were applicable to homeless LGBTQ youth aswell. For instance, when asked in open-ended interviews and focus groups about their lives, thefollowing information emerged:• Thirty percent of youth had spent the previous night outdoors, on the street, or in a car orvacant building.• The majority (over 75 percent) reported negative and regular interactions with the police.One prominent reason for this was being ticketed for offenses such as sleeping on thestreet and being unable to pay the fines, resulting in criminal records which impede theirefforts to find employment and housing.29• Despite the reality that homeless youth are frequently the victims of crime while on thestreets, not a single respondent described turning to police for help or reporting beingvictimized.• Only seven percent were runaways, in the sense of having left home by choice.• When asked how they thought others perceived them, homeless young people reportedbeing perceived as, or called, “lazy, bad kid, bum, troublemaker, lowlife, piece of s—,scumbag, junkie, whore, gangbanger, the lowest of the low, and worthless.”• Over thirty percent said their major challenges were finding affordable housing and a jobthat would provide enough income to maintain that housing (over 45 percent).This last statistic echoes remarks by one of the service providers at JYS. In an interview,service provider Lucille pointed out that if you were to ask the young people staying at thevarious programs provided by JYS, “they would tell you that their major concerns are findingwork and a place to stay.” This fit well with the kinds of resources that are offered at the libraryin this case study, the City Library.Needs of homeless LGBTQ youth. “Homeless people seek more than food and shelter.Such basic needs are important. However, seeking friendship, support and community areequally important.” (Hodgetts, Radley, Chamberlain, and Hodgetts, 2007, p.716)Finally, it is important to look at the particular needs of the homeless LGBTQ youth. Inaddition to the information needs of any youth their age, employment and housing, as alreadymentioned, were high on the list of expressed needs. The Spring 2011 edition of StreetTalk, thenewsletter published by JYS, gave an overview of the latest report on youth homelessness in theCity. Included in that overview were:30• Lack of employment is still a major barrier to stable housing. At program entrance, 77%of youth were unemployed, among those 87% were actively looking for work.• Average income at program entrance was 12% less than last year and less than half ofwhat it costs for a studio apartment in the City.In addition, educational opportunities were needed. According to the same report,“Reengaging youth in education continues to be an important step in moving youth toward self-sufficiency. Among older youth, 43% come to us without a high school diploma or GED. Morethan 1/3 of school age youth have dropped out.” Although these statistics related to all homelessyouth, they certainly applied to LGBTQ homeless youth, since they represented such a largeproportion of this population.Next, many of these homeless youth - like homeless adults - needed access to legaladvice and legal documents, such as birth certificates and court orders. Transgender youth, inparticular, who wanted to change their names and their gender identification, needed to knowhow and where to do the legal documentation changes, such as court orders, passports, socialsecurity, legal power of attorney, driver’s license or state identification card, wills, birthcertificates and marriage licenses. Even domiciled adults can struggle with legal jargon andaccess to appropriate forms, not to mention any attendant fees and differences among state laws.The added stress of being young, without funds and living on the streets made this much moredifficult. For example, one homeless youth, Talyn, talked about the challenge of getting the nameon hir library card changed to match hir new name. S/he was confused about how to do it andworried about how difficult it would be. However, s/he was reluctant to draw attention to hirselfby asking.31Additionally important is the need for a safe, secure and welcoming environment. Muchof what these youth had experienced made them suspicious and uncomfortable with adults inpositions of authority and in bureaucracies in general. In many cases they have been ostracized,then shamed and blamed for their living situations. As Woronoff, Estrada and Sommer (2006)put it: “LGBTQ youth are often dispersed and lost without a community to cheer and encourageand love and cherish them. These young travelers need to be armed with the knowledge that theyare not broken; there is no need for a cure.” Caring adults who welcome and affirm who they arecan make a significant difference in their lives and their ability to move beyond their currentsituations. Shelton (2008) said it well: “Through creating a non-judgmental environment inwhich queer young people can vocally lay claim to their unique experiences in the presence ofother young people and adults, they begin to find validity in their own lives and to trust their ownvoices” (p.79). The last part of this quote is particularly important, since there is a tendency foradults, such as librarians, to discourage autonomy in young people, even among those they aretrying to help and especially if the young people have been described as “at risk.” As Rasmussen,Rofes and Talburt (2004) explained:How might we reframe young people as creative participants in institutional and non-institutional spaces? And how might we challenge universalizing representations of queeryouth in popular and scholarly discourse that focus on support and intervention, andconsider instead young people’s creativity in the negotiation of their sexual subjectivities,identities, and practices in various contexts? Young people’s actions are notrepresentations or enactments of a preconstituted, fixed group, but contingent invocationsof identity in which they enunciate desires for affiliation, community, recognition, safety,32and danger at the same time that they may articulate responses to exclusion andmarginalization. (p.7)These questions underlie much of the work that is being done for and with homelessLGBTQ youth. It is not easy for caring adults to set aside their own preconceptions, especiallyaround issues that may make them extremely uncomfortable. Allowing these young people totruly be themselves, even as they are discovering who that is, can be challenging work thatrequires a real commitment, as well as pertinent and current information. So another need forthese young people are capable adults who are willing to learn and listen by taking advantage ofthe many resources that are available. These include studies and resource lists, such as All OurChildren: Strategies to Prevent Homelessness, Strengthen Services and Build Support forLGBTQ Youth (2010), commissioned by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, and theAnnotated Bibliography: Resources for Working with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender andQuestioning Youth and Families in the Foster Care System, sponsored by the U.S. Department ofJustice (2006). All Our Children began with a letter to the mayor, which included this paragraph:While the Commission’s findings confirm that LGBTQ homeless youth face specialchallenges, we strongly believe that the recommendations and strategies set out in thereport offer actionable steps to promote best practices, foster a culture of respect andacceptance, and address the underlying causes of homelessness among LGBTQ youth.(2010)The report then went on to list a sort of strategic plan for addressing not only the issuesconfronting homeless LGBTQ youth, but also ways in which that homelessness may beprevented. Examples of suggestions included:• Identify and disseminate resources for families of LGBTQ youth.33• Create policies and protocols to ensure LGBTQ-affirming service environments andexplicitly prohibit harassment and other unacceptable behaviors.• Provide ongoing, in-depth LGBTQ-competency training to frontline staff at all relevantCity agencies.• Explore ways to expand employment and work experience opportunities for LGBTQhomeless youth.All of these suggestions related directly to public libraries. Librarians are experts inproviding resources in all areas and their goals include providing an environment that isculturally competent and welcoming.A third report, one of the most in-depth recent documents on homeless youth is Why TheyRun: An In-Depth Look at American’s Runaway Youth (National Runaway Switchboard, 2010).This report looked at 10 years of expert studies; weighed the trend data compiled by the NationalRunaway Switchboard, which handles more than 100,000 calls annually; and, reported on one-on-one interviews with 83 runaway or throwaway youth between the ages of 14 and 17. Thegoals of the report were:• To understand the decision to run away and gain insight into prevention.• To determine youth knowledge of available services and how youth access them.• To determine any barriers, real or perceived, for runaway and at-risk youth in accessingservices.• To assess the best methods to reduce the barriers to accessing services by runaway andat-risk youth.• To assess marketing and outreach strategies to communicate with runaway and homelessyouth. (p.2)34It is worth noting these goals are strikingly similar to the goals of the needs assessments doneby libraries. These assessments are used to gauge interest in services, materials and programs andthe ways in which the libraries are meeting the needs of their users. This report gives insight intothe very questions asked by librarians when they are interested in serving a population: What arethe barriers to accessing needed resources?When asked to describe themselves, the youth offered a range of terms, such as: “arunaway with permission; a lost child in need of help; looking for a better chance; living on myown; I feel like I wasn’t accepted; I was disowned; neglected; traveler; street kid; and, homeless”(p.9). It is possible that if librarians had access to these self-descriptions, they might be morelikely to consider playing a role in the lives of these young people. This is part of the corecategory cultural competence that is discussed in Chapters Four and Five as part of the findings.A final report worth mentioning is Voices from the Street: A Survey of Homeless Youth byTheir Peers (Bernstein & Foster, 2008). Their summary of the challenges to these young peopleincluded the following list:Other challenges to stabilizing their lives that young people cited included findinginformation, lack of credit history, lack of ID and other documents, a criminal record,discrimination, lack of transportation, pet ownership, lack of self-confidence, findingchildcare, difficulty in leaving other homeless friends behind, drug addiction, poordecision-making, harassment by law enforcement, mental illness, immigration status, andlack of money generally. (Bernstein and Foster, 2008, p.39)All four of these documents, and many more, provided background, statistics,recommended resources and other information that could provide caring adults with theinformation they need to open their minds and their hearts to these young people. At noted in35Chapter Five, these are examples of resources that could aid public librarians in understandingLGBTQ homeless youth and how to provide relevant services to them.Public LibrariesPublic Libraries and Homelessness. “A library is not a community masturbation center.A library is not a porn parlor. A library is not a refuge for the homeless.” (Cronin, 2002)“I think library administrators need to think beyond the walls of their particular institutions toconsider the broader contexts in which they act and exist. Public libraries are part of broadercommunities, and the excuse that ‘we didn’t get into this profession to become social workers’doesn’t really carry much weight. If you are a public servant, you serve the public. You workwithin, are a part of, and help to define your community. You absolutely must open your eyes tothe social, political, economic and cultural contexts which contour your work. I think we need towake up to the fact that behavioral policies in public libraries are political.” (Impagination, 2008,blog entry about homeless man suing public library)Most of the literature relating to homelessness and public libraries focuses on homelessadults, primarily homeless individuals, although there are a few references to homeless familieswith children. The impetus for these articles is usually either a concern with managing theirbehavior in the library or a reaction to efforts to manage their behavior. Public conduct policiesin particular target homeless adults by limiting the amount of baggage that can be carried into thelibrary, by forbidding sleeping and by prohibiting the use of the public bathrooms for bathing.Other restrictions include either disallowing a library card for those without a permanent addressor severely limiting the number of items that can be checked out. Odor policies, too, are enforcedat some libraries, thereby denying library access to people who also have no way to take showersor who choose to remain unwashed to protect themselves on the streets.36It is interesting to note that while homeless queer youth are impacted by many of thepublic conduct policies in public libraries, the policies were not necessarily designed to targetthem. As previously noted, this is usually an invisible group and librarians are in most casesunaware of their presence in the Library. When casually asked if they used the Main Library(located five blocks from their transitional housing), a group of homeless youth answered in theaffirmative. When asked if they had talked to the librarian or asked for help, all answered in thenegative. The homeless youth interviewed individually for this research had the same responses:Yes, they used the City Library and no, they did not interact with Library staff. These responseshighlighted the challenge of creating an atmosphere in which homeless LGBTQ youth feelcomfortable enough to reach out to Library staff.Attitude. One theme that can be seen throughout the literature on libraries andhomelessness is that of attitude. Hersberger (2005) put it succinctly: “The primary issue facingservice providers to the homeless can be summed up in one word: attitude.” She went on todescribe a study in which friendly librarians were called “friends” and unfriendly librarians madepatrons experiencing homelessness feel “unworthy.” Wen, Hudak and Hwang (2007) providedexcellent insight into this topic in their qualitative study of homeless adults in healthcare settings:Most participants perceived their experiences of unwelcomeness as acts ofdiscrimination…The participant stated that he perceived unwelcomeness through theattendant’s ‘attitude’ and not because of anything the attendant said. Thus, somehomeless individuals may impute a great deal of meaning to brief contacts that do notinvolve any overt verbal discourtesy. (p.1013)The authors pointed out these feelings led to a disinclination to get help with healthissues. Homeless focus group participants also commented on the attitudes of the librarians37toward homeless people, noting they felt watched and distrusted (personal communication,2009). Posner (2003) made the excellent point that if library patrons were confronted with alibrarian who seems arrogant or rude, it can be not only infuriating but can be both demoralizingand emotionally painful. It can also discourage library use, as Radford (2006) noted. For thepreadolescents she interviewed, “the most important factor in their perception of successfullibrary visits is the attitude of the librarian or staff member they encounter” (p.57). She gave anexample of a seventh grade girl who never went back to her library after a negative interactionwith a librarian or staff member. This was supported by comments from one of the homelessyouth, Monica, when asked about visiting the Main Library:They’re rude here…I don’t think they understand that, like people are low-income…And maybe they weren’t, maybe it’s not a rule here that you have be considerate ofpeople like that, you know?…So they have this like, they have like this view of people,when you walk in it’s like you’re going to do something wrong, that’s what I can feel.Relationship building by people who are experiencing homelessness can be directlyimpacted by attitude. Hutchison, Abrams and Christian (2007) found in their research withhomeless adults that while initially the active participation of these adults in accessing socialservices was dependent on “their own personal attitudes, perceptions and norms,” after one year,their service use was predicted by their interactions with service case workers and other users ofthe service” (p.45). Their point, that developing a positive relationship with caring professionalsaffects how the participants chose to get needed resources, applies equally to librarians.Hostile or unwelcoming attitudes can add to the feelings of exclusion felt by LGBTQhomeless youth. Already marginalized by their sexual orientation, gender identity or housingstatus, they are vulnerable to any negative or unwelcoming comments or behaviors wherever38they go. Public libraries, possibly their only portal to crucial information, must be seen asaccessible, reasonable and welcoming or they may be avoided.Public Libraries as Public Space“Where we live and our passages across space are central to our identities, outlooks, priorities,strategies for survival” (Ingram, 1997, p.32).The topic of public libraries as public space is not one that has been frequently mentionedin either library or urban geography literature. However, there has been much written about theconnection between homelessness and public space, as well as gender, sexuality and space.Therefore, it seems appropriate to take a look at this topic while considering the role of publiclibraries in the lives of LGBTQ homeless youth.To begin, a brief definition of space is offered: “’Space’ is commonly defined as adelineated or loosely bound area occupied cognitively or physically” (Désert, 1997). Thus spaceis not only physical, but also mental or even philosophical. It is essential to keep in mind thatspace, even physical space, plays a major role in creating environments that are conducive to orobstructive of a truly democratic society in which each person is valued equally.Homelessness and space are considered first. As a society, Americans hope to not have todeal with the homeless population - this group is moved out of public spaces, like libraries, bythe creation of public conduct policies and anti-homeless environments that target people withouthomes. An examination of homelessness begins to reveal the ways in which public spaces can becreated to either validate those who occupy them or seek to expel them. These spacescommunicate with the public, whether or not they realize it, and those who do are most oftenthose who are negatively impacted. Finoki (2011) called this concept “weaponized architecture”and he said: “…The physicality of architecture is more dangerous as a form of social control39because we are talking about physical space…” (Funambulist). Examples of this kind ofarchitecture are ever-present in the urban environment, although domiciled adults may notnotice. They include metal prongs in window wells, benches with arms placed close together,and even pink lights to discourage young people from loitering. That is, purposeful choices arebeing made about who should be encouraged to inhabit public spaces and who should not.This same dynamic exists for gender or sexual orientation and space as well, although itcan be much more subtle. Désert  (1997) gave an example of how space can communicate apreference for gender or sexual orientation:In America, the heterocentric domestic house is defined ironically by the suburban home.Programming intrinsic to the home’s configuration presupposes and encouragesheterocentric activitiy…The Master Bedroom, set in isolation over a litter of smallerbedrooms, orchestrates a social order of age, sexuality, and ownership. (p.22)While this is private rather than public space, it provides the backdrop for assumptionsmade in a heterocentric society. These assumptions underlie many of the decisions made aboutpublic space, including how people who occupy it are expected to behave. For example, howeach community member experiences public space is dependent on whom they are. Ingram,Bouthilette and Retter (1997) offered their observations:If we were to ask a few hundred residents of a neighborhood to draw their public openspace and to talk frankly about it, different experiences (reflecting various levels ofprivilege, access to resources, and risks) would emerge, in many ways defined by gender,race, culture, age, mobility, and sexuality. (p.56)The experiences of homeless LGBTQ youth in public spaces are affected by thesesocietal attitudes, whether or not they are actively aware of this. The impact of the public library40as one of these spaces needs to be examined, because the way the space is experienced can be asimportant as the other factors already listed, particularly attitude. One could say that the“attitude” of public space itself offers either a welcoming or a hostile environment. How thisattitude is exhibited and which of these dominates could affect whether or not needed resourcesare being accessed. As Massey (1994) put it:Social relations always have a spatial form and spatial content. They exist, necessarily,both in space…and across space and it is the vast complexity of the interlocking andarticulating nets of social relations which is social space. Given that conception of space,a ‘place’ is formed out of the particular set of social relations which interact at aparticular location. (p.168)The social relations formed between homeless LGBTQ youth and public librarians arecreated by numerous visible factors, such as collection choices, signage, attitude, programs,resources, outreach and the day-to-day human interactions between staff and library users.Whether or not a young person who identified as LGBTQ and homeless felt welcome andsupported in the City Library was an integral aspect of this research. Because if the space itselfcommunicated a negative or even disinterested message, the opportunity to serve this youngperson was lost. Williams (1978) said it well: “In a simple sense we think of buildings as forshelter, for use inside in a simple way. We sometimes forget that buildings, particularly publicbuildings, very powerfully communicate social meanings and are intended to” (pp.71-72).When asked about the connection between space and power, Foucault answered: “Spaceis fundamental in any form of communal life; space is fundamental in any exercise of power”(Foucault and Rabinow, 1984, p.252). How public libraries choose to welcome and serve theirlibrary users is a critical part of this power, since - as mentioned in Chapter One - information is41power and libraries are first and foremost purveyors of information. This makes these decisionspolitical, whether or not the architects or designers are aware they are. Smith (1999) said simply:“The appropriation and use of space are political acts.” Finoki (Funambulist, 2011) expanded onthis idea, saying: “Architecture is the materiality through which politics are reified. It is not onlyhow we physically negotiate the landscape but how one imagines it [and] how one imagines itfor another…” This imagining for another can lead to social exclusion and stigmatizing, asmentioned in Chapter One. Massey, Allen and Sarre (1999) put it like this:…[Geographers] have noted that differences between people can lead to a socialexclusion that is spatially enforced. From this perspective, it can be understood thatpeople who are seen as unacceptably different are locked up, moved on, shunned,marginalized, ridiculed, and even/or murdered. (p.112)Public libraries participate in this imagining, by the creation of a public space that is in theorydesigned for everyone. The reality is different and this research sought to understand how thiswas so.Public Libraries and Social Responsibility. “A legacy of activism stands ready for usemade significant by the fact that solutions to the country’s deep and worsening crises will comeabout only through social struggle and because of the strategic role of information in socialaction.” (Bundy, 1987, p.94)As introduced in Chapter One, there has been much discussion in the library world aboutthe social responsibilities of public libraries. It is amazing, in fact, to know that for over 40 years,library meetings and discussions have included heated and frequently rude exchanges about therole of the public library in modern society. Forty years ago the Social Responsibilities RoundTable (SRRT) of ALA was created so progressive and activist librarians could have a forum for42conversations as well as action. While in many ways this round table has filled an importantfunction, calling itself the “conscience of ALA,” in other ways it has created an easy target forthose in the library profession - and outside the profession - who seek to criticize ALA for itsprogressive and political agenda.The question that was foremost in these debates is what was appropriate work forlibrarians and what was not. A 2008 American Library Association (ALA) online survey oflibrarians about library services to people experiencing poverty prompted an article by Gieskes(2009) titled Why Librarians Matter to Poor People. One of the most interesting results of thissurvey was the following bullet point in the article:Given the low rate of ALA member survey response and the hostility shown by somerespondents when answering some questions, the [Hunger, Homelessness and Poverty]task force recommends ALA clarify why library services to the poor are integral to ourprofession, the Library Bill of Rights, and the Freedom to Read and not a fringe issue.(p.55)This brief paragraph was illuminating, in that it encapsulated this very issue: The role ofpublic libraries in what could be perceived as social responsibility or social justice issues.However, one could ask: What constitutes social justice? How can and do librarians differentiatebetween social justice and the work they do daily as librarians? Is literacy a social justice issue?Is providing employment resources? Is providing materials in languages other than English?How about passport services or books with large type or fax machines or test preparationmaterials? On the other end of the spectrum, what are appropriate services and programs forlibraries? Are library sleepovers for teenagers appropriate? Should public libraries be providingbook groups or yoyo competitions or sing-alongs or magic shows or guess-the-amount-of-candy-43in-the-jar contests? Sometimes it is not easy to differentiate between what is “proper” for alibrary to provide and what is not, and this confusion is part of the question about social justiceand libraries. Bundy (1978) had much to say about this question:The inhumane liberalism in which the profession has indulged far too long allows theinstitution to maintain the importance of serving all comers equally and thus to treat asequally compelling a request from a suburban housewife wanting to plan flowerdecorations for a dinner party, and the plight of a hungry child. The reality is that thedeprived make next to no use of libraries and libraries do next to nothing to reach them…Even the most service-minded of librarians continue to treat the symptoms rather thancauses. They will help a welfare mother get her cheque, but they are not actively engagedin working on local welfare rights programs or in bringing about badly needed legislativereforms in the welfare systems. (pp.109-110)In an article about the history of social activism in ALA, Raber (2007) gave an exampleof the July 1952 Report of the Trustees of the Public Library of the City of Boston, which madeit clear that the library was “to provide the means of equalizing and maximizing individualopportunity to participate in civic society while combating divisive cultural, social and politicalinfluences” (p.676). However, at the time - and continuing to the present - some librariansobjected to even this kind of statement. As Raber reported it, librarian Ervin Gaines “later arguedthat racism and urban social violence, although serious problems, were not public libraryproblems and must be left to other agencies because those agencies and libraries have their ownbut different moral imperatives” (p.678).Some of the arguments against what are perceived as social justice issues, such asreaching out to local shelters or taking a stand on military spending, are couched in language that44speaks of the need for libraries to remain neutral. The Activities Committee on New Directions(ACONDA), a predecessor to SRRT, included the following passionate passage in their final1970 report:The cry is that we are an association of libraries, not librarians, and should only exist topromote library services. Yet our institutions (libraries) are surrounded by pollutions andviolence and under threat of nuclear extinction. Racial tension and social unrest upsettheir daily routines constantly. For a national association to ignore these threats seems theheight of folly. Yet we are daily advised by some of our members to eschew involvementwith these dangers, lest we render ourselves subject to reprisals and tarnish our goldenneutrality. (Raber, 2007, p.685)It is difficult to call public libraries neutral, no matter the guise, because whenever adecision is made about library programs, policies, resources, outreach, services or materials, thatdecision is made by human beings who are influenced by social forces, whether or not thelibrarians are aware of those forces. The impact of all of these decisions on the library’scommunity is uneven, at best, and alienating for some.The Community-Led Libraries Toolkit (2008) provided excellent examples of this in itsreport on the “Working Together Project,” which ran from November 2005 to April 2008, duringwhich time it “explored the application of community development techniques in developingmore inclusive public library services in Canada” (Working Together Project, 2008). This four-year project offered disengaged or underserved community members a chance to relate theirlibrary experiences, impressions and expectations. The resulting toolkit offered what they call“six key lessons,” most of them echoing Bundy’s (1978) concerns from 30 years earlier:• Library culture, along with rules and procedures, create significant barriers to inclusion.45• Libraries must recognize that same or consistent customer service, which does not takeinto account socio-economic disparity, results in inequitable services that furtherdisadvantage socially excluded people.• Planning relevant and effect library services for socially excluded community membersrequires a collaboration of equals between the community members and the library.• Relationship building is at the core of effective service planning.• Staff “soft skills” such as empathy, interpersonal competence, and open-mindedness areessential.• People want to see themselves represented in the library and to have an opportunity toparticipate. (p.8)The listed key points lend support for public libraries to be actively engaged in improving thelives of homeless LGBTQ youth, since these young people certainly qualify as social excluded.However, how individual librarians perceive their responsibilities varies, as evidenced by regularemail exchanges on library e-lists. In this research, the librarians were willing to play a role inthe lives of homeless LGBTQ youth; they saw it as appropriate library work. However, therewere barriers for them, particularly not having enough time and the lack of expertise in this topic.Public Libraries and Urban Teens. “In the present political moment, it sometimes seems asif we have an easier time accepting the power and agency of cultural institutions, than that ofpeople, particularly young people.” (Rasmussen, Rofes, and Talburt, 2004, p.3)Another way to approach the question of what role public libraries should play in thelives of homeless LGBTQ youth is to look at the role these libraries play in the lives of urbanyouth in general. One of the most comprehensive books on this topic is Urban Teens in theLibrary, edited by Agosto and Hughes-Hassell (2010). As they explained, they put together 2346developmental tasks that “covered the range of information behavior teens had reported for thestudy” (p.29). This list led to a theoretical model with seven areas of development: The socialself, the emotional self, the reflective self, the physical self, the creative self, the cognitive self,and the sexual self (p.29). They defined each category and gave examples of the informationteens sought for each. For instance, sexual self included “sexual safety and sexual identity” (p.31).This breakdown of teens’ information needs was useful for public librarians who werelooking for guidance on their role in the lives of the teens they serve. It also provided them withsupport they could use when advocating for services to teens. Agosto and Hughes-Hassell (2010)also provided suggestions from teens on improving library services to them. The authorsorganized these into four categories and provided the following list:StaffKnowledge: Urban teens’ resource preferences; local community characteristicsAttitudes: Tolerance, kindness, mutual respectPoliciesComputer: Flexible time limits; free printing; reduced game restrictionsBehavioral: Fewer library use restrictions; space for socializingServicesTeen programs: More programs; more relevant and interesting topicsTeen input: In planning and developing programs; in selecting resourcesCollectionsBooks: More urban fiction, more popular fiction, multiple copiesMovies and magazines: More popular titles, more relevant titles, more up-to-date titles47Computers: More accessibility, more computer gamesMusic: Ambient music; in-house listening stations(from chart on p.34)It is interesting to note that these suggestions reiterated much of what was said by thehomeless LGBTQ youth. This is revealing, since it highlights the relationship between domiciledand homeless urban youth needs. They also help contribute to what has been called an “outcomesbased” approach to providing teen services. Examples of outcomes related to teens include:• Youth contribute to their community• Youth feel safe in their environment• Youth have meaningful relationships with adults and peers• Youth achieve educational success• Youth have marketable skills• Youth develop personal and social skills(Meyers, 2010)It is clear from these lists that a dedicated effort is needed to create excellent library servicefor urban teens and that the outcomes apply to any urban teens, whether domiciled or homeless,straight or LGBTQ.Another author who offers insight into this topic is Brehm-Heeger (2008), with her bookServing Urban Teens. She gives an historical overview of library services to teens in urban areas,and she emphasizes the importance of having library staff who are prepared and willing toenthusiastically serve teens (p.14). She offers concrete examples of the messages to give to allstaff about serving this population, and one of these seems particularly relevant to homelessyouth, although she makes no mention of them:48Teens in urban areas come from a variety of backgrounds and may have very few positiveadult role models in their lives. Library staff members may be the only positive adult rolemodels with whom some urban teens have daily contact. (p.15)In addition, Brehm-Heeger gives advice to library staff about serving their teen patrons and thisadvice echoes comments made by homeless youth and adult library users. Included in this adviceare:• Know teens’ names• Greet teens when they come into the library• For teens living in urban areas where it is not uncommon to live in poverty, negativeevents unfortunately can be a regular part of life. Staff members should be open tolistening when teens talk about what happened that was bad or confusing and should beprepared to refer teens to organizations that can provide further assistance, such asshelters and clinics offering free counseling.• Treat teens with respect• Take the time to explain to teens exactly how to find information when conducting areference interview…Librarians offering this one-on-one attention clearly not only helpteens understand how best to use library resources but also reinforce to teens that theyhave the right to be empowered to make individual choices by being informed about howsystems work and about the variety of choices available to them. (pp.18-21)Using these authors as an example, it can be seen that there are guidelines and resourcesavailable for librarians who serve urban teens, including homeless LGBTQ youth. It is also clearthat much thought, discussion and effort has gone into the creation of these resources and thatteen librarians, at least, consider it worth this effort.49Public Libraries and LGBTQ Youth. In the past 20 years, some progress has been made inaddressing the needs of LGBTQ youth and adults in public libraries. Libraries have the potentialto change lives, by providing much-needed resources and a staff ready and willing to educatethemselves on the needs of all of their library users. However, there is much more work to bedone.One of the seminal (and rare) books on this topic is Serving Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,Transgender, and Questioning Teens by Martin and Murdock (2007). They explained the needfor their book by pointing out that “only a handful of researchers have studied the informationneeds of adult gay and lesbians, and even fewer have specifically examined the needs of queerand questioning teens” (p.20). In addition, “studies of how well libraries are meeting these needsare also scarce or outdated” (p.22). Much of the research they did included descriptions of thelack of meaningful and truly accessible resources and services for LGBTQ youth. They providedsome hypotheses as to why this would be:• Fear of book challenges• Fear that if a controversy does arise, the library will lose funding• Assumption that other libraries will pick up any slack in their own collections• Lack of awareness, or outright denial, that LGBTQ teens frequent the library• Lack of knowledge about LGBTQ issues - or fear of them• Homophobia on the librarian’s partThese hypotheses fit well with other articles written about serving LGBTQ teens or adults.Fredericks (2005) gave a glimpse into the life of a librarian who works daily as a Youth ServicesLibrarian and advisor to her library’s Teen Advisory Board. It was clear from her article that shewas concerned about the LGBTQ teens who used her library and consequently she offered50suggestions on LGBTQ resources for other librarians. But most of all, she provided insight intoher thoughts about her work:Adolescence is a difficult time of life. Teens often look to adults besides their parents foradvice and direction. The library, being part of the community, is often the place whereadolescents find that other adult. Some librarians fear this kind of responsibility, butworking in public service sometime requires doubling as a social worker…By remainingopen-minded and really listening and not preaching, librarians can provide teenagers anopportunity to explore their concerns and feelings. The library, as a member of acommunity, needs to be a safe place where adolescents can explore ideas. (p.14)These remarks are as relevant to homeless LGBTQ youth as they are to domiciled LGBTQyouth.Mehra and Braquet (2006) provided insight into the kinds of materials needed by theseyouth, especially as they “come out,” a process they refer to as continual and a “constantnegotiation of self-identification as ‘queer’” (p.97). In their article, the authors used a table tosummarize “the information-seeking behavior during coming-out experiences in terms ofthoughts, feelings, and actions” (p.116). This kind of information is valuable to librarians whoare serving homeless LGBTQ youth, as well as those who have permanent and reliable housing.Albright (2006) offered examples of public libraries that already provided services to theLGBTQ community, such as booklists (both print and online), as well as links to “networks,organizations, and authoritative information on pertinent issues from reputable sources” (p.53).As she pointed out,Every community needs to see their culture reflected in literature. Due to theoverwhelming emphasis on heterosexuality in today’s society, this need is especially true51for the LGBT community…It is especially essential to provide information and supportfor young adults who are questioning their sexuality or who are aware of their sexualidentity and feel isolated from family and friends. (p.55)Albright’s article is a good example of what public libraries could be doing as part of theircommitment to provide equal access to all and how services to the LGBTQ community arerelevant whether that community is housed or living on the streets.Hughes-Hassell and Hinckley (2001) also wrote a short article about the importance ofreaching out to LGBTQ youth. They offered a list of Web sites that provided credible, reliableand relevant resources for LGBTQ youth, pointing out that “Librarians can reduce the feelings ofisolation many LGBT youth experience by providing access to responsible Internet resourcesdesigned specifically for them” (p.39). These are the kinds of resources that made a difference inthe lives of the homeless LGBTQ youth in this study, and they provide support for the removalof barriers to access such as limited computer time for those experiencing homelessness. Thisleads to the next section: Barriers.Barriers. Although there is pertinent and useful information for librarians on how toserve their LGBTQ teen library users, there can be multiple barriers to this service. In Barriers toSelecting Materials about Sexual and Gender Diversity, Gough and Greenblatt (2011) provided alist of common barriers to providing excellent service to LGBTQ adults and teens. Examplesincluded statements like:• “My library doesn’t cater to special needs.”• “Only heterosexuals live in the area my library serves” or “Lesbian, gay men, etc. don’tseem to use my library.”• “It’s too difficult to identify worthwhile LGBTIQ materials.”52• “Buying LGBTIQ materials would be promoting gender or sexual nonconformity.”• “I’m personally uncomfortable with exposing myself to what some of these materialsdescribe.”• “That stuff doesn’t belong in my library.”• I don’t approve of people who don’t conform to conventional behaviors orreading/listening/viewing interests.” (p.169)As the authors explained, most of the librarians have been “thoroughly socialized in aheterosexist culture” long before they become librarians. So although they may have had libraryschool classes in such topics as LGBTQ collection development, these classes may not always“penetrate the results of many years of social conditioning” (p.169).They also pointed to ALA’s Access to Library Resources and Services Regardless of Sex,Gender Identity, Gender Expression, or Sexual Orientation: An Interpretation of the Library Billof Rights (ALA, 2004). This interpretation examined the Articles of the Library Bill of Rightsand created logical connections from the Bill to the concept of access for all, including thosewho identified as LGBTQ. For instance, Article V is examined and interpreted:Article V holds that \"A person's right to use a library should not be denied or abridgedbecause of origin, age, background or views.\" In the Library Bill of Rights and all itsInterpretations, it is intended that: \"origin\" encompasses all the characteristics ofindividuals that are inherent in the circumstances of their birth; \"age\" encompasses all thecharacteristics of individuals that are inherent in their levels of development andmaturity; \"background\" encompasses all the characteristics of individuals that are a resultof their life experiences; and \"views\" encompasses all the opinions and beliefs held andexpressed by individuals. Therefore, Article V of the Library Bill of Rights mandates that53library services, materials, and programs be available to all members of the communitythe library serves, without regard to sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Thisincludes providing youth with comprehensive sex education literature.Other Articles looked at materials with all points of view, the origin of materials and theircreators, and the use of meetings rooms and exhibit spaces, and it was demonstrated that all ofthese can be re-interpreted with LGBTQ library users in mind. It is interesting to note that so farthis kind of interpretation has not been extended to those who are experiencing homelessness. A teen services coordinator also offered insight into the barriers to service. When askedwhy he didn’t celebrate Pride Month or create other examples of inclusion in the teen section inhis library, he answered “Ignorance” (personal communication, 2011). This powerful wordcovers much more than might appear initially. In general, teen librarians are active supporters oftheir library users. They want to help, they want to provide materials, resources, programs andactivities that the teens want and need. They create Teen Advisory Groups (TAG), they consulteach other on programming, teen spaces, materials, and even outreach. Yet without theinformation that there are teens who are LGBTQ or LGBTQ and homeless who might use theirlibrary if they created an atmosphere of inclusion and safety, their very ignorance acts as perhapsone of the biggest barriers of all.Public Libraries and LGBTQ Homeless Youth. “None of the youth identified arelationship with a services provider or adult in a helping role when describing what was goodand positive.” (Bernstein, p.46)There is considerable overlap between the lists created for urban youth and the needs listedfor homeless LGBTQ youth. This makes sense, since these homeless youth are not defined bytheir housing status or even their gender identification or sexual orientation. That is, they are54urban youth and like their domiciled counterparts, they have youth needs. They have the sameneeds for library materials that reflect their lives and caring adults who reach out to them bylearning their names and showing respect.Another point that needs to be made in this chapter is that many of the youth in this studydid not fall into the traditional age range for teen services. The YALSA definition of young adultis ages 12 to 18 (YALSA, October 16, 2012), a definition that does not include the youth whoare between 18 and 24. This fact serves as an important barrier to services to homeless LGBTQyouth, because while they may be experiencing what should be adult problems, such as lack ofhousing, they are still teenagers. Even the ones who are in their early twenties are frequentlyemotionally younger than domiciled young adults of the same age. There is little literature onthis gap in library services for any youth who fall into this category and while this case study cancontribute to the conversation, much more research needs to be done. A teen librarian expressedconcern about this issue as it related to any young adults, LGBTQ or straight, domiciled orhomeless. She found it extremely difficult to suddenly cease providing a separate space andunique materials to the youth she served, simply because they were no longer 18 (personalcommunication, May 31, 2011). She pointed out that there are special services to older adults -seniors - but not to younger ones.Although there is overlap between the library needs of homeless LGBTQ youth anddomiciled urban teens, it is also true they have other needs related to their housing status or thechallenges they encounter on a daily basis. However, so do many other library users. Seniorsmay need help finding reputable and trustworthy health practitioners or affordable housing.Families with children may seek local school information, resources on childrearing or names oflocal pediatricians. Spousal abuse, mental illness, poetry to quote at a funeral, help getting online55for the first time - all of these are common topics in public libraries and they are usuallyanswered respectfully and thoroughly. This list could go on and on, because public librariesmake it a practice to answer the individuated and unique questions of each of their library users.This is an important point for librarians, because it could appear that dealing with homelessyouth will somehow be more onerous or demanding or will require more skill and time thandealing with those urban youth who identify as straight and who have dependable and regularhousing. In their article about libraries that served people who are experiencing homelessness,Gehner and Freeman (2005) provided this insight:You don’t have to solve a person’s problems. I work with homeless people every day and Idon’t solve anybody’s problems. Homeless people don’t ask me to…They have to do thework. I can connect them to a resource, but I can’t do the work. And librarians can’t do thework for people either. But you can connect them to resources, and that’s what your jobs are.(Shelter and housing specialist John Petroskas, as quoted in Gehner & Freeman, 2005)Abbie, a service provider at JYS, expressed this same thought when she defined harmreduction:We believe that change needs to be self-driven, programs need to be, include the say ofclients. People, you know, can reduce the risk in all aspects of their life.  I mean we’rejust here to help and guide them and give them options and resources, when they’re readyfor those.Public libraries also make a point of trying to reach what are traditionally called“underserved” users - those community members who don’t use the library at all or who use itrarely. Efforts are made to seek out these individuals and demonstrate to them how the publiclibrary is relevant to their lives. However, this population - LGBTQ homeless youth - is not a56group actively courted by libraries. The combination of homelessness, which is a topic manylibrarians do not want to take on, and LGBTQ, which at best is confusing and at worst is fraughtwith prejudice, may make this group invisible to librarians. The fact it appeared these youth werereluctant to actively engage with librarians further reduced their visibility.Finally, Lowery (2010) provided this heartfelt insight into the experience of onehomeless LGBTQ youth in a public library:When I was kicked out for the final time at seventeen, the first thing I did - after findingsomewhere to sleep for a few days - was go to the library. I scanned each spine and indesperation began pulling books off the shelves, running fingers over tables of contentsand skimming introductions. This was the first time a library had failed me. I needed abook about how to live through this more than I needed to know I had somewhere to stay,to know I had a way to get to school or to know what I would have for dinner. I needed abook to prove to me that survival was possible. The only books about queer youth I founddidn’t talk about police reports, restraining orders or backpacks full of clothes. That day,sitting in a back corner of the public library in Gladstone, Oregon, I pledged that if Isurvived, I would do everything in my power to make sure that never again would aqueer kid feel alone after losing family. (Introduction, pp.13-14)It is experiences like hers that prompted this case study and informed the questions: Dothe needs of homeless LGBTQ homeless youth fall within the purview of a public library? Whatdo the librarians think? What do the youth think? What do the providers think? That is, what isthe role of the public library in the lives of homeless LGBTQ youth? The next chapter explainshow this question was approached.57Chapter Three Methodology“…We know there’s no such thing as nonpolitical research. The people we set out to understandlive in worlds of context and meaning, which in turn are held in place by power - whether local,national or global remains an open question.” (Agar, 1996, p.29)This chapter provides a description of the research perspective, the case study method,the approach to the research itself, the handling of data, the theoretical perspective, theparticipants and their recruitment, the data analysis and how grounded theory was used andevaluated.The Research Perspective and DesignThis case study used a phenomenological approach and qualitative methods to helpunderstand the role of the public library in the lives of LGBTQ homeless youth. This approachwas chosen because it “allows researchers to get at the inner experiences of participants, todetermine how meanings are formed through and in culture, and to discover rather than testvariables” (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.12). It was particularly appropriate for this researchquestion because responses to the question of the connection between the City Library and thehomeless LGBTQ youth were personal, varied and unpredictable. It would be challenging tocreate a quantitative study that would be able to take into account the possible feelings, attitudesand underlying beliefs about libraries that existed for the three populations included in thisresearch.This was a case of a city public library system in an urban gay-friendly U.S. with a largehomeless LGBTQ youth population who lived on the streets, in the parks or in emergency ortransitional housing. Long interviews with the City librarians, the homeless LGBTQ youth and58the service providers for those youth provided insight into how the Library was impacting andinteracting with these youth. Because the question was about the role of the public library in theirlives, Library staff, service providers and the youth themselves together told the story of thiscase. This Library was not chosen as a representation of libraries across the United States,although it seems clear that the findings could be applied to many of these. However, my taskwas to allow each group to speak and by bringing their voices together, create a theory thatwould serve as a guide for all of them. Maxwell (2005) said this well:The selection of this particular case may involve considerations of representativeness(and certainly any to attempt to generalize from the conclusions must takerepresentativeness into account), but the primary concern of the study is not withgeneralization, but with developing an adequate description, interpretation, andexplanation of this case.” (p.71)The use of unstructured interviews also seemed to fit best with this question. Althoughinterview guides were used, they were used as guidelines only (see Appendix G, InterviewGuides). As Lindlof and Taylor (2002) put it: “Although the interviewer often goes into theinterview wanting to cover certain areas, relatively little structure is imposed (e.g., questions areusually open-ended)” (p.4). The interview guides used in this research were altered as interviewsproceeded. This adjustment was in keeping with the basic concept of grounded theory, whichwill be discussed shortly. The actual changes made to the guides were documented and used asdata, since they gave insight into the process of creating a theory from the totality of the data.The adjustments made to the interview guidelines were also a part of the grounded theoryapproach being used, as the interviews were conducted, then coded and compared to previous59data gathered. This constant comparison offered insights into other questions that could be askedto further inform the research.Unlike a positivist approach, which uses the ontological creed that “the business ofscience is to discover the ‘true’ nature of reality and how it ‘truly’ works (Guba, 1990, p.19), thephenomenological approach searches for individual answers from the participants and uses theseanswers to make sense of a question. This approach allows an interviewer to elicit informationfrom participants that is personal and draws on their own life experiences and accumulatedknowledge, the “life-world” or the “world as it is encountered in everyday life” (Gurwitsch,1974). By studying the life-world, the researcher is able to access the “perceptual experience”(Gurwitsch, 1974, p. 18) of the participant, rather than interjecting a preconceived idea of what istrue and what is not. That is to say, there is no right answer to a question posed to a participant -the answer s/he gives is based on the meaning the participant makes from the world. Thismeaning is important because it indicates how the participant interprets the world. It comes fromtwo sources: Sociohistorical and biographical. These two make up a person’s “stock ofknowledge at hand” (Gurwtisch, 1974, p.19), that is, the way a person looks at the world, therules s/he lives by and other behaviors and thoughts that guide her or him in life. Sociohistoricalknowledge comes from the unconscious: Those ideas, thoughts, impressions that are handeddown and are unacknowledged but powerful influences as humans try to understand the world.Biographical knowledge is the information collected from life experiences. Sometimes these twotypes of knowledge can contradict each other and sometimes support each other.The paradigm of phenomenology is based on the idea that “knowledge is a humanconstruction, never certifiable as ultimately true but problematic and ever changing” (Guba,1990, p.26). This statement says it all. The study of a subject, like public libraries and LGBTQ60homeless youth, cannot result in one true answer, but instead has resulted in the multipleperceptions, opinions, biases, reflections and experiences of the respondents as well as theresearcher. The sum total of this research was the resulting knowledge that was biased andsubjective and thereby enlightening. By taking the time to delve deeply into a participant’sparticular view of the world and the subject of inquiry, this researcher had the opportunity to beexposed to the “acts of apprehension and interpretation” of each individual (Gurwitsch, 1974).These are the ways in which the respondents take in information about their world and interpretit based on their own experiences and the “stock of knowledge at hand” (Gurwitsch, 1974). Thisstock of knowledge naturally affected the thoughts and opinions that were shared with theresearcher. That is, all the factors that created the opinions, feelings, thoughts, ideas andimpressions of the participant were in effect during the interview. This is the basis forphenomenology and the study of the individual. As Schutz (1967) said: “The aim, then, is tointerpret the actions of individuals in the social world and the ways in which individuals givemeaning to social phenomena” (p. 6). That individuals are trying to seek meaning in the worldaround them underlies the phenomenological approach to research. They use the informationavailable to them to try to understand their lives and the researcher must remain open to thehearing their understanding. As Moran (Figure/Ground, 2011) put it: “The discipline ofphenomenology means the discipline of stopping yourself from being carried along anyparticular avenue of meaning, until we really allow the phenomenon to show itself.”This was challenging at times, because a large amount of factual information abouthomeless LGBTQ youth, the agency that was serving them, and the City Library had beengarnered. In addition, the jargon and attitudes that are an integral part of the public library worldwere ingrained after 20 years as a public librarian. Therefore, there were times when a kind of61shorthand existed between the librarians being interviewed and myself, and it was difficultsometimes to feign ignorance or to ask for specifics without making assumptions. In addition,while fervently pursuing a less gendered, less binary approach to society, it was still true I wasraised to see the world as divided into arbitrary groups: Female and male; housed and unhoused;addicted and free of addictions; and, stable (or mentally well) and unstable (or mentally ill anduntreated or inadequately treated). These binaries have been an encumbrance, particularly aroundthe issues of mental illness and addiction. There was a struggle to become comfortable withthose who are not sober or not coherent in a way that was recognizable. However, the years ofthis research allowed for progress and it is hoped these experiences can guide others who choosea similar path.Sacks (1990) alluded to this challenge when he said, describing his work withParkinson’s patients:But one cannot go straight forward unless the way is clear, and the way is allowed. Onestruggles to gain the right perspective, focus, and tone - and then, one loses it, allunawares. One must continually fight to regain it, to hold accurate awareness.” (p.xix)Accurate awareness was definitely the goal.Case Study MethodThere were a variety of qualitative research approaches that could have been used for thisstudy. However, once it became clear the research would be about one the City Library and thatit would examine the relationship between that library and the homeless LGBTQ youth in thatcity, a case study seemed appropriate. As Yin (2009) explained:A case study is an empirical inquiry that62o investigates a contemporary phenomenon in depth and within its real-life context,especially wheno the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident.In other words, you would use the case study method because you wanted to understand real-life phenomenon in depth, but such understanding encompassed important contextualconditions - because they were highly pertinent to your phenomenon of study. (p.18)This study looked at a contemporary library, in the real-life context of its policies, attitudes andenvironment and how those were impacting the lives of these homeless LGBTQ youth.In addition, although in-depth interviews were the primary source of data, they wereaugmented with observations, written records - such as City Library policies and shelter rules -and informal conversations with shelter staff and homeless youth. This was not only in keepingwith the qualitative approach, it was supported by Yin’s description of relying on “multiplesources of evidence” (p.18). Or as Harper (1992) stated: “Each case study demands a differentmixture of observation, participation, and interviewing…How these three elements cometogether…varies greatly” (p.152).The case study approach served, too, as a constant reminder of what specifically wasbeing researched. That is, this was not a random set of interviews and observations, cursorilycalled a case study. It was a response to the question: What is the role of the public library in thelives of homeless LGBTQ youth? It was the story of a library and how it interacted with a groupof young people, as they led their lives and struggled to survive on the streets of the city. Thiswas in keeping with Wieviorka, (1992) who admonished readers to remember:Regardless of the practical approach for studying it, a case is an opportunity for relatingfacts and concepts, reality and hypotheses. But do not make the mistake of thinking that it63is, in itself, a concept. A case draws it unity not from the theoretical tools used to analyzeit, but from the way it takes shape, namely as a social or historical fact combining allsorts of elements into a set comprising social roles, an institution, a social movement, or alogic of community action. But it is not, in itself, these roles, this institution, or this socialmovement. (p.160)This case study used observations, interviews and written materials to create anunderstanding of the sociological significance of the story being told. It could be called a parable- there was a moral to this story and the case study approach allowed for a search for that moral.In keeping with this storytelling approach, insights into my own journey through this case havebeen included in the findings and the discussion. As Platt (1992) so aptly pointed out, there weresurprises along the way. Existing assumptions and preconceived ideas about homeless youth,bureaucracies and libraries came up against new knowledge and insights. As Platt put it:One way, and a rhetorically very effective way, of reaching a conclusion and taking thereader with you to that conclusion is to tell the story of how you arrived there yourself.This almost certainly entails showing that you were initially wrong or were surprised bywhat you discovered. This is a very different strategy from the ‘scientific’ one ofconcealing human agency in the production of the findings, and starting with a hypothesiswhich has been confirmed. (p.29)The story of this public library and its role in the daily lives of these homeless LGBTQyouth could have been be told in many ways. In this case, it was told by someone who workedfor 20 years as a public librarian, who believed emphatically in the power of public libraries toserve their communities in positive and active ways, and who was new to both research and thetopic of homelessness. One could imagine this case as being like a large multi-faced diamond. I64held it up to the light and turned it slowly between my hands. I wondered at its existence and thelight it reflected and I pondered what it meant. I observed, I queried, I thought, I madeconnections and then, as the storyteller, I could only describe what I saw and experienced. Stake(1978) explained this style well: “Most case studies feature…data that are likely to be gathered atleast partly by personalistic observation; and a writing style that is informal, perhaps narrative,possibly with verbatim quotation, illustration, and even allusion and metaphor” (p.7). In keepingwith Stake’s words, I chose an informal writing style that allowed my voice to come through.As Padgett (2008) said: “The key distinguishing feature of case study analyses is thatthey maintain the holistic integrity of the case. A ‘case’ is unpacked and its contents closelyexamined, but the parts are ultimately viewed as a whole and in relation to each other” (p.144).The parts in this case were the facets and the whole was a diamond in the hands of an activistlibrarian.Interviews. Based on this concept, this research employed primarily one-on-oneinterviews with three groups:  Librarians, service providers engaged in work with LGBTQhomeless youth, and the LGBTQ homeless youth themselves. Initially, my plan was to interviewonly teen librarians, since they were the group who could be addressing the information needs ofthis population. However, it became clear that other librarians could provide insights into theservices and materials being provided to youth, as well as the barriers to these offerings. Also, Islowly began to realize that perhaps by accepting the idea that teen librarians were the only oneswho could provide appropriate services to teens, I could be perpetuating the concept of asegregated population, a kind of “it’s not my problem, it’s yours” attitude toward serving teens inthe Library. In addition, since a case study approach was employed, it was important to talk toparticipants at all levels of the organizations. This turned out to be a fortunate decision, since it65was not until I had access to the homeless youth that I discovered that although the teenlibrarians had many of the necessary skills, interest and background for serving homelessLGBTQ youth, some of these youth did not technically qualify as teens in the City Library.Additionally, they did not identify as teens, so they fell into a gap in services, which added totheir feelings of being unwelcome at the Library.It was appropriate to use one-on-one interviews since these individuals were the onlyones who know how they felt about public libraries and homeless LGBTQ youth and what thelibraries meant to them in light of their roles. As McCracken (1998) put it: “The long interviewgives us the opportunity to step into the mind of another person, to see and experience the worldas they do themselves” (p.9). The universal theory of consciousness supported this approach,since it was based on the idea that knowledge was created through consciousness; therefore aresearcher must gain access to common expressions of the participants’ thoughts and definitions.Human beings are striving to make meaning of the world; that is, it is each participant’sparticular worldview that was being studied.There was also, unexpectedly, one hour-long focus group with homeless youth, becausethe opportunity arose. The discussion at the focus group was enlightening and the verbalinteractions and non-interactions were pertinent to this study and to the emerging insights intothe interactions of the youth with the Library.Literature review. A literature review was done in advance of the interviews, lookingfor ideas and information that could serve as prompts during the interviews. The literature reviewwas not used to create an a priori theory, however. To have done so would have been incontradiction to the basic concept of phenomenology - that it is through the participant’s wordsthat meaning and understanding and theories can evolve, rather than posing a theory and trying66to make the words of the participant match the theory. Instead, it served as one method ofgathering as much information on the topic as possible. As McCracken (1988) pointed out, “thefirst step of the long qualitative interview begins with an exhaustive review of the literature” (p.29). With this information, the interviewer is able to look for contradictions to research that havebeen previously been presented by other researchers. While there is the natural danger thatknowing about current theories could bias the researcher, this is offset by the ability to step awayfrom information and use it as way of gaining distance from the topic (McCracken, 1988, p. 31).Keeping McCracken’s words in mind, though, the researcher was also aware thatThere is no need to review all of the literature in the field beforehand…It is impossible toknow prior to the investigation what salient problems or what relevant concepts will bederived from this set of data. There is always something new to discover…Also, theresearch does not want to be so steeped in the literature that he or she is constrained andeven stifled by it. (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.36)So, as seen in Chapter Two, there was an overall look at the literature that seemedappropriate to begin with, but with the awareness that as analysis of the data proceeded, therewould undoubtedly be other relevant literature that needed to be included. This was indeed true.Additionally, Corbin and Strauss (2008) provided suggestions on how the literature could beused. Examples included:• It can be a source for making comparisons.• It can enhance sensitivity.• It can provide questions for initial observations and interviews.• It can use used to stimulate questions during the analysis.67• It can be used to confirm findings, and just the reverse, findings can be used to illustratewhere the literature is incorrect, simplistic, or only partially explains a phenomenon.(p.36)These authors explained the second item on this list, sensitivity, by saying itrequires that a researcher put him- or herself into the research. Sensitivity means havinginsight, being tuned in to, being able to pick up on relevant issues, events, andhappenings in data. It means being able to present the view of the participants and takingthe role of the other through immersion in data. (p.32)All of these suggestions were considered as the research progressed and responses have beenincluded as appropriate.Bracketing. Next, stock was taken of my own thoughts, knowledge and preconceptionson the topic of teen librarianship, youth homelessness and LGBTQ youth, doing whatMcCracken (1988) called “using self as an instrument of discovery” (p. 32) or an effort toresearch the researcher (E. Haley, personal communication, February 5, 2009). Taking stockallowed the use of what has been called “bracketing,” a way of attempting to set aside thesepreconceptions while engaging in the research. This is related to the concept of epistemology, theidea that reality is socially constructed and that research is a co-creation of the researcher and theresearched. As Corbin and Strauss (2008) put it: “The researchers’ “knowledge and experience(professional, gender, cultural, etc.)…enables them to respond to what is in the data” (p.33). Thismeans that the findings “are a product of data plus what the researcher brings to the analysis”(p.33).68In this case, my views on public space, public libraries and LGBTQ youth homelessnessand any corresponding attitudes and assumptions affected the questions, the responses and thefinal analysis of the material.In particular, as the research progressed, it was critical to constantly stay aware of myown prejudices. My rapid descent or ascent - depending on how one views it - into critical theoryhas produced a willingness to assume there was always a larger agenda than the one that wasvisible. For instance, I see homelessness and poverty as failures on the part of society and not onthe part of an individual. Yet I also discovered how important it was for the homeless youth tonot be considered victims of circumstance, but to instead be supported as resilient andcourageous people struggling to move on in life. To truly understand the population beingstudies, it was imperative to move beyond existing prejudices and assumptions and to allow thelibrarians, the youth and the professionals to tell their stories without letting those assumptionstaint their realities.Another issue was the assumption that someone who has been ostracized and who leads aless conventional life will be liberal and open-minded. Yet during the focus group I found, forexample, that one of the issues the youth were uniformly adamantly opposed to was the abilityfor Library patrons to access pornography on a Library computer. This was extremely surprising- to hear what could be considered a conservative view coming from this group of youth whodressed and acted in ways that were not always palatable to the average domiciled straight adult.I realized that part of this was their lack of understanding about library culture, in this case, thatculture’s dedication to intellectual freedom. Of course this issue is not even one that isuniversally agreed upon even in library circles - there are certainly librarians who do not thinkthis is appropriate. But the contrast between what I thought, the assumption I made about these69youth, and the reality of their opinions was enlightening and offered yet another opportunity fortaking stock of my own preconceptions.Padgett (2008) referred to this as reflexivity and defined it as “the ability to examineone’s self” (p.18). She went on to point out that “examining one’s biases is not a one-time thing,but requires ongoing vigilance throughout the course of the study” (p.18). I certainly found thisto be true.This is also reminiscent of Corbin’s (2009) words, as she described her attitude towarddoing qualitative research:“I agree with the feminist notion that we don’t separate who we are as persons from theresearch and analysis we do. Therefore, we must be self-reflective about how weinfluence the research process and, in turn, how it influences us.” (p.40)Interview guide. As a guide for the interviews, a list of possible discussion questionswas initially created. These questions acted as prompts for the participants and they came fromthe personal experience of the interviewer as well as from articles about public space,homelessness, LGBTQ homeless youth and public libraries. This guide was simply a tool and Iremained open to either not using particular questions or adding questions as the interviewprogressed. It is important for the guide to remain flexible since the interviewer should followthe lead of the participant and not apply a rigid conception of the interview. “The interviewermust be able to take full advantage of the contingency of the interview and pursue anyopportunity that may present itself” (McCracken, 1978, p.25). This approach is in keeping withthe methodology of phenomenology, in that it adheres to the idea there are no preconceived ideasof how the respondent will answer questions but instead allows the interviewer to follow therespondent’s lead. By incorporating the interviewee’s comments into the ongoing interview70itself, the “final analysis is richer and more descriptive than the initial guide would indicate”(Haley, 1996).This discussion guide began with broad questions about the participant, such as “Tell meabout yourself.” This approach fosters trust building, which is an essential part of the longinterview, since the interviewer particularly wants insight into how the participant truly views theworld and the subject at hand. If the participant is relaxed and comfortable, s/he is more likely tobe open and honest. According to McCracken (1988): “This is an important time to reassure therespondent because it is in these opening stages that he or she sets his or her defenses. Thebiographical data questions can serve this purpose” (p.38).Next, questions were asked that related directly to the participant’s life. Agar (2012,personal communication) also provided useful advice when he encouraged me not to make myparticipants do my work for me. So instead of asking for a summary, such as a typical day or thebiggest challenge, I made an effort to ask more specific questions, such as: “Tell me about agreat experience you had at the Library” or “Tell me about a difficult interaction you had on thestreets.” These questions depended on who was being interviewed.  In the case of the teenlibrarians, other questions included such items as: “Tell me about a barrier you’ve experienced indoing your work” and “Give me an example of one group you feel you aren’t reaching.” For theprofessionals who work with LGBTQ homeless youth, these questions included: “Describe asuccessful collaboration” and “Can you tell me one thing you would like public librarians toknow about this population?” Finally, for the homeless LGBTQ youth themselves: “Do you havea pronoun preference you would like me to use?” and “How did you come to be homeless?”and “Tell me about one time you found help that was really useful.” In asking these questions, I71also learned to incorporate the suggestion from Becker (1998) that instead of asking “why?” ask“how?” so as to not make the participant defensive (p.58).It was hoped that answers to these questions would lead to other questions that allowedthe participant to speak from personal opinion, experience and knowledge. That is, the questionswere used to facilitate that process, but it was the experiences of the participant that guided thedirection of the conversation. This was indeed true. An example of this is when I wasinterviewing a former chronically homeless person (which means that she was not only homelessbut also had a disability of some kind, such as - in her case - an addiction), Theresa, who nowworks for the Library. I asked her about the youth having a negative experience at the Libraryand whether or not word about that would spread to other homeless youth. I based my questionon the assumption that some library staff were unfriendly to people who appeared homeless andso there would be a negative interaction. I also took my question from her observation that word-of-mouth is one of the most powerful ways of communication on the streets. Her response wasthat she could not imagine them having a bad experience in the Library and that any negativefeelings they might have would come from them. As Theresa put it:There’s a sense that you’re doing something wrong…by being in places that aren’t meantfor homeless. You know, the general, uh, perception of the Library isn’t, it certainly isn’ta homeless drop-in center… So, I think there’s that same feeling, you know, that “I mightnot be welcome here. They might not want me here.  If they see me, they might throw meout.”This was illuminating, because I had not thought about the way in which homelessness isstigmatized in our culture as affecting a person’s comfort level in a library, and so I probably72would not have asked specifically about that. As will be seen in Chapter Four, Theresa’s feelingcontributed to the final theme of “feeling safe.”As the interviews progressed, it became more and more clear this kind of researchprovided credibility and respect for the participants, particularly the homeless LGBTQ youthwho may not have felt heard or respected in their daily lives. Moran (Figure/Ground, 2011)expressed this idea when he wrote about the “personalistic attitude,” mentioned by suchphilosophers as Husserl, Wittgenstein and Scheler, explaining that it is “living first and foremostin a personal world with others; and ‘persons’, of course, means that we respect each other assources of meaning and value” This personalistic attitude underlies my work.Settings. The interviews took place at locations that were, it was hoped, comfortable,non-threatening and convenient for the participants. When interviewing the professionals and thelibrarians, many of the interviews were in their personal offices or in other private space overwhich they had some control, such as a staff or meeting room at either the JYS or the Library.This was interesting, since one of the concerns was the idea of space and who controls it. Until Istarted doing the interviews and accommodating to the less convenient interview spaces of thosewho have less control over their lives, I had not considered the meaning of the interview spacesthemselves. But as I continued to set up interviews, I started to realize how the interview spacesreflected - in most cases - the power of the individual. That is, the interview spaces fitBourdieu’s approach to social differentiation mentioned in Chapter One. The higher up theperson was in the organization, the more privacy and space they could access and the more theywere able to control with whom they interacted on a daily basis.For example, one Library administrator had a spacious, beautifully decorated, clean andwell-organized room with a view of the City and enough space to house at least one family. Her73comments were not only confidential, because I - in compliance with IRB requirements - erasedall personal indicators from the transcript, but they were also confidential because we were ableto meet in private. Her power and position gave her privacy.The other Library administrator also had her own room, but chose not to use it - I did notask why. We used a small meeting room, with the door open, so others could be heard and could,I assume, hear us if they wanted to do so. Other Library staff - lower in the Library hierarchy -were interviewed at library tables when the Library was closed or in the shared staff room,giving us some privacy although staff members could interrupt, watch or overhear if they sochose.On the other hand, most of the interviews with the youth took place in a study room inthe Library. I was unable to reserve the room in advance, so we sometimes had to wait forsomeone to vacate a room. We did have some privacy, because we used an individual studyroom that is somewhat soundproofed. However - I assume to cut down on potential illegal oruncomfortable behavior - the walls of the rooms were entirely glass, so there was no visualprivacy at all. An unexpected outcome of meeting the youth at the Library was the opportunity toobserve them in the Library setting, to make verbal and physical references to it, and to answerquestions about Library resources. Perhaps one of the most enlightening moments came whenTalyn, a young homeless youth, and I started to enter through the Library’s security gates. Oneof the uniformed security guards, standing in the doorway of his office, called out to Talyn: “Youcan’t enter the Library with that stick!” Talyn was holding a bamboo pole s/he used as a walkingstick. It was about six and a half feet tall, about one and half inches in diameter and was coveredwith stickers. Talyn had long blonde hair topped by a well-worn cap and wore a t-shirt, jeans andboots. S/he identified as transgender and was not readily recognizable as either male or female.74In response to the guard’s admonition, s/he said clearly but not optimistically, “I need it for myback.” The security guard stayed where he was, so I approached him and said, “Talyn uses thestick for hir back.” The guard said, “Well, it should have a rubber stopper on the end, but I’ll letyou go this time. Next time it has to have the stopper.” I walked back to Talyn, explained thesituation, and s/he thanked me as we walked through the security gate, saying, “Last time theywouldn’t let me through at all.”Another day, at the close of the interview, one of the homeless youth, Ary had somequestions about finding resources in the Library. We went together to the online catalog and Ishowed her how to search for materials and how to understand how to locate them in the Library.This was a question that obviously could have been directed toward one of the librarians, but itwas not. In fact, it was not even directed toward me - it came out of our conversation about thetopics she was pursuing. How this young woman could feel comfortable enough to approach oneof the Library staff to ask her questions underlies this research. Her hesitancy to do this had notangible reason as far as I could ascertain. She had never been treated rudely at this Library, shewas an outgoing and confident person and she was not obviously without easy access to freshclothing or showers. Yet not only was she reluctant, but I was, too. I could have suggestedwalking over to the reference desk together, but I could not be sure they would treat her well.This was enlightening to me, because I am comfortable in libraries and I usually do not hesitateto approach Library staff with a question. I am one of them, yet her discomfort made meprotective and uneasy. This was again an aspect of the emerging theme, feeling safe.In all cases, the location arrangements were made to accommodate the participant asmuch as possible.   It was particularly helpful if it could be a quiet spot, to facilitate not only theconversation but also the tape-recording of it, since all participants agreed to be tape-recorded.75The participants were assured of the confidentiality of the interview and that access to theinformation gathered was restricted to the researcher alone.Handling of dataAs McCracken (1988) so emphatically states, interviews “must be recorded on tape”(p.41), and they must be verbatim (p.42), since any kind of summary or abbreviation of thematerial would take away from the ability to understand the participant’s own thoughts on thetopic. I certainly found this to be true: Being able to access the exact words of the participantsafterwards offered much greater insight than my notes could have done. After each interview, Imade every effort to immediately transcribe the recordings and review my notes.However, there were times when I was unable to transcribe the recordings before anotherinterview. I found that when someone was available to be interviewed, it was best to takeadvantage of that availability as quickly as possible. The interviews seemed to happen inclusters, particularly as I reached out to various groups and got responses from individuals.“Strike while the iron is hot” would probably be the most apt way of explaining this and I choseto do just that. However, overall the interviews were spread over a period of time and thatallowed me to apply insights from earlier interviews to later interviews. As mentioned already,one result of this was the constant updating of the interview guide.To be able to work with the material following the interviews, the researcher must be ableto analyze the actual words used by the participant. Accuracy is important: “It must be exact, sothat no unnecessary ambiguity exists” (McCracken, 2008, p.50). To best obtain this accuracy,once tape recordings were transcribed, the transcriptions were checked against the originalrecordings, looking not only for word accuracy but also for a reflection of the nuances ofemphases, pauses, laughter and other non-verbal expressions.76However, a small portion of the data for this research relied on quick notes written eitherduring observation or as close as possible afterwards. In these cases, the exact wording ofconversations was not obtained, but the opportunities I had to be an observer in various LGBTQevents provided valuable insight into the daily lives of these young people. In addition, therewere casual conversations with youth, staff and librarians that added to the data and could onlybe written as well as possible after the interactions. For these situations, I heeded the words ofStern (2009): “I think we all agree with the truism: Everything is data” (p.56). In addition,Stern’s attitude toward accuracy is one I found myself agreeing with in these situations:Notwithstanding possible boos from an audience, I confess that from my point of view,data accuracy is highly overrated. A grounded theory study is a theory generated fromconglomerate data, interviews, observations, literature or even statistics, so whatdifference does it make if Mary said, “I don’t think I can go on, “ or “I just can’t go on.”The essence is there - Going on might be the substantive code. (p.57)So, although I believe in accuracy as much as possible, I was comfortable with less accuracywhen it was necessary.This process also facilitated deciding when enough participants had been interviewed,since the interview process should continue at least until redundancy is reached. That is,individual participants in each of the three categories were interviewed until clear patternsemerged as to their ideas about the possible role of public libraries in the lives of homelessLGBTQ youth and until it appeared that no new insights would be presented (Haley, 1996, p.26).This is an appropriate criterion for qualitative research, since the researcher is not looking formerely numbers or a particular sample size, but is instead striving to understand the topicthrough the eyes of the respondents.77I also took into consideration the fact that I was doing a case study and so wanted togather enough data to get a picture of what was going on in this case. Because of this,participants who represented different dimensions of each agency were interviewed. As with anyresearch, more data could have been collected, but I stopped when I felt I was hearing variationson the same stories. That is, I reached redundancy in each population - the librarians, the serviceproviders and the homeless LGBTQ youth.Confidentiality. For all three of these groups, University Institutional Review Board(IRB) permission was sought and received before any interviews were held (see Appendices Band C). Although permission was received to interview youth under the age of 18, none of theparticipants were younger than 19. Prior to each interview, each participant was given a briefdescription of the research and was asked if s/he would be comfortable being tape-recorded.Permission was granted in every case. Each participant signed a consent form, agreeing both tobeing interviewed and to being tape-recorded, and each person was given a copy of the form tokeep. To protect the confidentiality of each participant, the consent forms were saved in a securelocation and kept separately from the transcripts. Each tape recording was erased from the taperecorder after transcription was complete. For all participants, pseudonyms have been used toprotect their identity. I chose the pseudonyms for the librarians and the service providers; theyouth chose their own.BricolageDenzin and Lincoln (2000) defined qualitative research as “a situated activity that locatesthe observer in the world. It consists of a set of interpretive, material practices that make theworld visible” (p.3). They went on to point out that qualitative research can involve a variety ofmethods and empirical materials, “that describe routine and problematic moments and meanings78in individuals’ lives” (p.3). Because each practice can create a different view of the world,qualitative researchers frequently use “more than one interpretive practice in any study” (p.4).They used the image of bricoleur, in which a researcher pieces together possibly new tools ortechniques in the quest for a deeper and richer understanding of the research question. As theysaid, choices about which techniques or approaches to use are “not necessarily made in advance”(p.4).Bricolage was an appropriate image for this research. As has been discussed, the LGBTQhomeless youth lived in many worlds. It was fitting that a variety of approaches were needed toexplore the role of the City Library in their lives. The theoretical approach described hereinformed me as I prepared to begin my research, but it was the research itself that provided thebest guidance and illuminated the need for additional methods. These included participantobservation, as well as simply observation, casual conversations, and a gathering of writtenmaterials from both the Library and the shelter.Observation. Early on in my research, I applied for and was accepted as a volunteer atthe Juniper. For the first six months, this volunteer job was comprised of cooking and servingdinner once a week at an emergency shelter, run by the JYS. This shelter served homeless youth,both straight and gender-conforming, as well as those who identified as LGBTQ. Over thisperiod of time, it was possible to observe the workings of JYS, as well as the daily lives of thisparticular population of youth. This experience provided insights into the topics of conversation,the behaviors, the interactions, the eating habits and the general demeanor of these youth. Everyweek there was a combination of regulars and newcomers. At that point JYS still had notprovided access to the youth for interviews, but the weekly experiences and observations wereinvaluable. These observations and interactions were incorporated into the analysis and the79descriptions, providing a more detailed understanding of the environments experienced by theparticipants. Corbin and Strauss (2008) recommended the use of observation, sayingIt is not unusual for persons to say that are doing one thing but in reality they are doingsomething else. The only way to know this is through observation. Also, persons may notbe consciously aware of, or be able to articulate, the subtleties of what goes on in theinteractions between themselves and others. Observations put researchers right where theaction is, in a place where they can see what is going on. (pp.29-30)Volunteering at JYS made it possible for me to be “right where the action” was and thiscontributed greatly to the ability to tell this story.Written data. Another source of data were the rules and behavior guidelines that wereposted, present on websites or presented as handouts. These organizational attempts at controlover the users of both the City Library and the Agency offered a fascinating look at thesimilarities between the two organizations. The signage, the policies and procedures in publiclibraries and shelters contributed to the collage of information, by providing “a picture of thepresuppositions and meanings that constitute the cultural world of which the textual material is aspecimen” (Peräkylä, 2005, p.870). The rules and procedures in both places had the same goalsyet they were experienced differently by the participants. This is discussed more fully in ChapterFour.Participants and RecruitmentPurposeful sampling was used to obtain participants for this research. Maxwell (2005)provided an excellent explanation of the reason for using this method for recruiting:This [purposeful selection or sampling] is a strategy in which particular settings, persons,or activities are selected deliberately in order to provide information that can’t be gotten80as well from other choices…Selecting those times, settings, and individuals that canprovide you with the information that you need in order to answer your researchquestions is the most important consideration in qualitative selection decisions.” (p.88)The three groups initially chosen appeared to be ideal for providing the kinds ofinformation that was being sought. Each group represented an aspect of this case and theparticipants were selected to address these aspects. These three categories included publiclibrarians, professionals who work with homeless youth and the youth themselves.Librarians. For the librarians, initially a choice was made to interview what were calledteen librarians. The purview of these librarians was, in theory, youth ages 12 to 19, although inreality most of the materials selected by the teen librarians were used by the youth in the lowerrange of these ages. As mentioned earlier, there was a gap in Library services to youth, if onegoes with the wider federal definition mentioned earlier, that this population is made up of 12 to24 year olds. Older teens and young adults, those between the ages of 19 and 24, wereconsidered by to be adults and thus it was assumed they would be served by the adult collections,services and programs. However, the fact was they were not so served and this gap in serviceaffected them.Additionally, one children’s librarian and two adult librarians were interviewed. Thechildren’s librarian was selected because he was the City Library’s liaison to a group ofconcerned professionals who worked with low income and homeless individuals and families. Itwas hoped his comments and ideas would offer some insight into why a public librarian wouldactively engage in community-based advocacy work. One adult librarian was chosen because hewas the branch manager for a branch that served a large number of LGBTQ patrons and therewas no teen librarian at that branch. It was hoped he could provide insight into his collection81development strategies, as well as into the perceived needs of that community. The other adultlibrarian was selected because she was the branch manager at a branch that served a largenumber of homeless youth and so she - more than any other librarian I talked to  - had dealtdirectly with the impact of this population on the Library.All the librarians - teen and adult - were recruited through the City Library itself. Somecontacts were made through an administrator in teen services, some were made by emailing thelibrarians, and one librarian was interviewed after an unscheduled visit to a branch library. Onceword got out I was interviewing librarians, it became easier to get participants, because theinterviewed librarians could vouch for me - so the snowball technique was employed. One of thebiggest barriers to recruitment was that the librarians said they did not know anything aboutyouth homelessness. It was challenging for them to understand I simply wanted to hear abouttheir work - I did not expect them to know anything about this topic.The Library administrators were recruited in a similar manner. Some were emailed,others were through existing connections in the Library system. The highest-rankingadministrator did not reply to emails, so I finally attended a City Library Commission meetingand introduced myself after the meeting. That proved to be effective and we eventually were ableto find a mutual time.Service providers. The next participants were service providers who worked with thehomeless youth, in particular homeless LGBTQ youth. In this urban area, JYS served the largestpercentage of the homeless youth. Out of the approximately 5700 youth who were homeless or atrisk of being homeless in City, JYS served about 3600 in various ways, including drop-in,residential, employment and education services. Since, as already mentioned, up to 40% of82homeless youth can be identified as LGBTQ, all service providers in this agency had providedservices to this population.In order to get insight into the opinions about the City Library of those holding differentpositions, six professionals were interviewed. These included: The director, the volunteercoordinator, a case worker at one of the drop in locations, the coordinator for the workforcetraining and employment program, the Youth Advisory Board coordinator and the manager ofeducation and training. In addition, one volunteer - who had volunteered at a similar agency inanother large urban area - was interviewed. These professionals were recruited through JYS. Infact, JYS required a submission of the approved IRB, as well as an interview, beforeconsideration of allowing recruitment of staff or youth would be made. This process wasextremely lengthy - it took six months for final approval. However, once this approval wasgiven, access was immediate and extremely helpful.Homeless LGBTQ youth.  Finally, homeless LGBTQ youth were interviewed. As Agar(1996) suggested:Rather than contacting the group directly, an introduction from a person or institutionsthat is well thought if by the group can be helpful…Because these persons will also be indirect contact with the group of interest, or know people who know the group directly,they can be an ideal bridge into the situation. (p.81)This suggestion on recruitment was taken to heart, because the LGBTQ homeless youthmay have had negative interactions with adults and authority figures and so could be moredifficult to access. As Cedar put it so well: “But there’s a lot of, you know, like, if somebody’sstraight and they’re trying to help you out, you’re like, why?”83Once access to the youth was granted, I attended events and approached the youth duringweekly visits to the drop-in location, Stop-By, where I maintained a small library. In general, theyouth were open and friendly and receptive to being interviewed, in part because they had beenseeing me regularly in my role as volunteer.Five homeless LGBTQ youth were interviewed one-on-one. Of these, two were youngwomen who identified as bi-sexual, two were young men who identified as gay, and one personas transgender. However, all of them also made a point of saying they really preferred non-traditional terms, like genderqueer or, as Isaiah put it, “My gender is queer.” So in a way theyhad dual identities - ones that might be more recognizable to a heteronormative or straight worldand those they felt more comfortable using. They were all between the ages of 19 and 22.In addition, I held a focus group that included four other youth and one young person,Talyn, who was later interviewed individually. In the focus group I did not ask how peopleidentified, although through casual conversations at Stop-By, I knew that two of the youngwomen, Apple and Riddles, chose not to self-identify.The following table provides a list of the participants, their pseudonyms and their role inthe case study. To further protect their identity, no distinctions have been made betweenadministrators and non-administrators.Table 1.

Researchers are the go-betweens for the participants and the audiences that they want to reach.”  (Corbin & Strauss,2008, p.49).The data from these interviews were analyzed inductively, meaning the “patterns, themes,and categories come from the data…rather than being imposed on them prior to data collectionand analysis” (Patton, 1990, p.390). This was crucial to this kind of research, since the answerscame from within the respondents and were not based on preconceived ideas. Each respondentanswered in her or his own words and it was the gathering of these words and the seeking forconnections among them that resulted in insights into the research question posed. I looked forkey phrases or terms used by the participants as they related to the relationship between theLibrary and the LGBTQ homeless youth (Patton, 1990, p.391).Emic terms were used as aids in organizing the data. Emic terms, as opposed to etic ones,come from within the culture being studied; etic ones are imposed from the outside. It wasimportant to use emic terms for this research since the goal was to understand the connectionbetween the Library and the LGBTQ homeless youth, as the participants themselves described it.A good example of an emic term came from one of the homeless youth, Isaiah. When describinghow he tried to avoid being identified as homeless, he called it his “class performance.” As heput it:I do consider it class performance in that like I am, I am not allowing myself to beperceived as homeless… So, I’m, I’m not kind of so much adding anything on, I’m just alittle bit more hyper vigilant when it comes to, “Am I looking like a… Am I lookinghomeless?  Am I looking poor?  Am I looking in any way out of line of the Hayes?”86The emphasis, as Haley (1996) said, is not on enumeration but on category construction.From larger categories may come smaller sub-categories or offshoots of the categories orstandalone ideas. The analysis of qualitative data is an intense, creative and evolving processand, as Patton (1990) says, although concepts may arise from the data, it is really the researcher’stask to “get out of the way of the data to let the data tell its own story” (p. 393).In their book, Corbin and Strauss (2008) described the association between data andconcepts or themes:Concepts/themes are the foundation for the analytic method described in thisbook…Concepts are derived from data. They represent an analyst’s impressionisticunderstandings of what is being described in the experiences, spoken words, actions,interactions, problems, and issues expressed by participants. The use of concepts providesa way of grouping/organizing the data that a researcher is working with. (p.51)The data in this qualitative research consisted predominantly of the words of the participants.The word “impressionistic” in the previous quote gave the greatest insight into this process, sinceit was really a combination of practice, persistence and intuition, and it is in some waysindefinable.However, additional data was gathered through observation, as well as print and websitematerials. Included in these were: Lists of rules, mission statements, the behavior guidelines forboth the City Library and JYS, event flyers, signage, posters, procedures (especially at theLibrary) and general impressions gathered during visits to the Phoenix, Stop By and the CityLibrary. All of these contributed to telling this story.87Grounded Theory. Grounded theory is a form of inductive analysis. It was chosenbecause little was known about the topic of this Library and its relationship to the homelessLGBTQ youth, and this theory relies on the words and actions of the participants, rather thanpreconceived ideas about their lives and their daily interactions. It was the job of the participantsto be themselves as much as possible and my job to allow their stories and the meanings of theirstories to direct my theory creation.As Morrison (2002) explained: “a theory in qualitative research refers to an organizingscheme for the data that places them in orderly patterns and gives meaning and insight into thelives of others” (p.20).  The process of generating a theory that evolved naturally from theinformation collected was begun while analyzing the data. Glaser and Strauss (1967) havedescribed this process as “the discovery of theory from data - which we call grounded theory…”(p.1). This process of discovery can be contrasted to research that hopes to validate or support apreviously chosen theory. Instead, Glaser and Strauss saw “theory as process” (p. 9). Theystressed the interpretive nature of this theory generation, saying:Theorizing is interpretive and entails not only condensing raw data into concepts but alsoarranging the concepts into a logical, systematic explanatory scheme…The constructionof theory necessitates that an idea be explored fully and considered from many differentangles or perspectives… (p.56)These many different perspectives were aided by the initial literature review, subsequentreadings and the ongoing reflection that accompanied the research. Glaser and Strauss alsopointed out that the generation of theory needs all three components almost simultaneously:Collection, coding and analysis of data (p. 42). In this research, this constant circle was anintegral part of the data analysis.88Coding. As Charmaz (2005) stated: “Coding is the first step in taking an analytic stancetoward the data…Coding gives a researcher analytic scaffolding on which to build”  (p.517).  Inthe process of coding, researchers are constantly comparing the data collected, the data with thecategories that emerge and the categories with each other (Charmaz, p.517). This approach wasused as the interviews were conducted, transcribed and analyzed continuously. It not onlyprovided insight into the research question itself, but it also provided insight into the researcher’sbiases and assumptions.The coding began with initial or open coding, and included efforts to remain open toexploring whatever theoretical possibilities could be discerned in the data (Charmaz, 2006, p.47).Rather than imposing preconceived ideas of what would emerge, I followed the words andthoughts of my participants, looking for the actions being expressed and using words that reflectthese actions (Charmaz, p.47). For example, two initial codes were: “Addressing behavior” and“Making assumptions.”  As the coding proceeded, I frequently asked myself: What is theparticipant’s concern? What is the action being described?Line-by-line coding was used in this open coding. Although, as Charmaz (2006) pointedout, this coding may seem like an arbitrary exercise, it was also - as she added - extremely useful(p.51). The concepts of grounded theory and coding were new to me and that may be why line-by-line coding of the first group of interviews created almost 2000 codes. Initially overwhelmedby this huge number, it was found that as the codes were organized into categories and then thecategories were defined, it was possible to make connections between the codes, the categoriesand the participants. The constant comparison that is an essential part of grounded theory becamemy friend, and Oktay’s (2012) description began to make sense:89Constant comparison is the basic method used in grounded theory to create theory out ofempirical data. By comparing case to case…the researcher develops “concepts.” Theprocess of constant comparison makes similarities and differences among cases apparent.Conceptual categories are specified and described, based on the data. (p.16)Throughout the research, I have kept memos and field notes of my thoughts, ideas,insights, connections, questions and observations. These memos have played a critical role in theevolution of my research, guiding my interviews, my readings and the conversations I have hadwith patient family members and unwary strangers. Corbin (2009) writes at length about theimportance of memo writing and her words expressed it well:I marveled at the information that a researcher can obtain from data if he or she asks theright questions and takes the time to write memos. In memos, it’s not just the researcherand not just the data that are talking, but a combination of researcher and the datainteracting together to come up with an explanation of what is going on. Memos are areflection, the records of that interaction. There is no possibility of omitting the writing ofmemos as a way of shortcutting the research process. (p.50)Here is an example of field notes taken at the Phoenix Resource Center:Field note:There are youth just hanging around, sitting on the couches, talking or not talking. Dogsare encouraged and they provide dog food, water bowels, dog biscuits. It seems like a lotof homeless youth have dogs. I asked the youth if they had any particular requests forbooks. I didn’t take their names - I wasn’t really organized yet. They requested: Fantasy:all, including TOR, an older series; DJ Thomas: any by him, including the White Hotel;folklore: mythology, Greek and Roman.; Jack London; manga: Dragonball Z, Hotel90Hina, Battle Royale; survivor books, like Hatchet and My Side of the Mountain; Horror:Dark Tower, S King: Tommyknockers, Robert MacCammon; Anne Rice; how to playbanjo, harmonica, guitar - For Dummies series; detailed maps of CA, U.S. - CA andlocal; Jack Kerouac; Peter Pan; Alice in Wonderland; Charlotte’s Web; classics; sexeducation. (November 15, 2011)Here is an example of a memo:When I started the research, the librarians didn’t want to talk to me because they didn’tknow anything about HY[homeless youth]; the SP [service providers] didn’t want to talkto me because they didn’t know anything about libraries or they were more concernedwith life and death issues. There was a general lack of knowledge about each other. Inorder for the HY to feel safe enough in libraries to take advantage of all the availableresources, they need to feel welcome. What they know is that there are rules and ways ofdoing things that they don’t understand. (September 21, 2012)Memos and a great deal of thought helped in the organization of these codes into 26concepts. This second step is referred to in this research as “second open coding,” and Charmaz(2006) described it as “using the most significant and/or frequent earlier codes to sift throughlarge amounts of data” (p.57). The codes that came out of these initial interviews offered insightinto what was happening in the data that had been gathered and what could be important themesor concepts for the ensuing interviews. This coding helped crystallize some concepts thatcontinued to be significant as the research continued, while helping to question the importance ofother concepts.The memos provided much-needed insight into my thoughts as I tried to literally focus onwhat stories were being told, who was telling them, how they were told and why they were told.91During this time, there was a constant flow of possible connections and ideas and I found that if Idid not record them immediately, they might be lost. I kept a notebook and pen in my pocket andsometimes would stop in the middle of the sidewalk to jot down a thought. I also had numerousnotes written on the back of receipts or on the edge of the morning newspaper or on the back ofgrocery lists, for the times when the notebook was not handy. After waking up in the middle ofthe night and trying to write with a dull pencil on the tissue box beside my bed, I placed a padand paper on the nightstand. This research was constantly in my thoughts and sometimes it feltlike one of those firework displays, where there is a burst of light that starts to fade and thensuddenly there is another and another. Like the displays, you have to pay attention quickly beforethey disappear forever.The next coding, axial coding, led to 16 broad categories. Oktay (2012) described thisprocess well when she said: “Sometimes what was originally identified as a concept is later seento be a dimension or property of a category” (p.65). These categories were used to create sixtheoretical concepts, which were then related to the two core categories. Out of these eight camea theory that represented an interpretation of the words of the participants and the added materialthat came from written sources and my own observations. Chapter Four offers more details onthis process.Evaluation. Evaluating qualitative social justice research requires a variety ofapproaches. Maxwell (2005) focused overall on the question of validity, which he defined as“”the correctness or credibility of a description, conclusion, explanation, interpretation or othersort of account” (p.106). He strongly makes the case that there are no “magical charms,” butinstead the main emphasis ought to be on “how you will rule out specific plausible alternativesand threats to your interpretations and explanations” (p.107). Padgett’s (2008) “strategies for92rigor” mirror many of the ones offered by Maxwell (p.179) and her concluding thoughts on rigorhave been greatly appreciated: “Rigor is essential to all forms of empirical research…Howeverthe evaluative standards are defined and applied, it is difficult to justify a nonrigorous study ashaving relevance” (p.197). I also appreciated her thoughts on defining the success of a study:“The capacity for a study to stimulate thought, improve practices and policies, and incite furtherresearch is a metric of success agreeable to most anyone” (p.183). If I achieve these with thisresearch, I will be happy.Taking into consideration that validity or rigor must be maintained throughout the study(Padgett, p.180), I have used a variety of methods, including triangulation, member checking,prolonged engagement, auditing, an auditing trail and “rich data” (Padgett, 2008; Maxwell,2005).For triangulation, the primary source of data, the long interview, was augmented withother sources. Maxwell defined triangulation as “collecting information from a diverse range ofindividuals and settings, using a variety of methods” (p.112) and for this study these included:Print materials, such as public conduct policies; observations; and information conversations,such as those with JYS staff or with the youth when taking book requests. The memos and fieldnotes served as data, but also as reminders of possible researcher bias, thereby also functioningas an “auditing trail” as Padgett (2008) described it (p.191). Padgett also pointed out that“triangulation by data source - the most common type - is typically used for corroboration orconfirmation. When data from field notes, interviews and/or archival materials are convergent,one has greater confidence that the observations are trustworthy” (p.188). This convergence wasfound in the data.93In this research, prolonged engagement included almost two years of weekly volunteeringand observing at JYS; 23 long interviews and one focus group, producing approximately 40hours of recordings; and approximately 1500 pages of field notes, memos and transcriptions.There was an ongoing awareness of what Maxwell calls “reactivity,” because I frequentlyfound myself in the position of unwitting go-between between the Library and the youth andJYS. The fact that I knew an extensive amount about both worlds meant I was frequently askedfor information or suggestions. It also meant my very questions served as prompts for all groups,since despite the apparent rifts between them, there was an eagerness to learn more about eachother. As Maxwell (2005) pointed out, it is impossible to eliminate the influence of theresearcher, but “what is important is to understand how you are influencing what the informantsays, and how this affects the validity of the inferences you can draw from the interview”(p.109). I tried to take these interactions into consideration as I analyzed the data.There was also awareness there was the possibility of bringing researcher bias intowhatever data was collected. As Maxwell pointed out, “in the final analysis, validity threats areruled out by evidence, not methods” (p.112). One way I have used evidence to support my datahas been to observe the youth in various settings, including on the streets, at JYS and at theLibrary. Their ease at JYS and their lack of comfort on the streets and at the Library have beenevident. In fact, one notable observation was that even if I had a good conversation with a youthat JYS, he or she would not acknowledge me on the streets. I have also used written materials tosupport the existence of stated rules and policies.Overall, the analysis of the data has been made as trustworthy as possible, becausetrustworthiness was critical if this research was going to accurately reflect the thoughts andfeelings of the participants. It must be as accurate portrayal of what the participants have said or94intended to say as possible, as heard and analyzed by the researcher, because the data from thelong interview is by definition information that comes from the respondents themselves. If theanalysis is inaccurate and not reflective of their own words, it is not doing its job. Narrative andquotations from the participants have been used liberally, since “sufficient quotational datashould be presented to illuminate and support whatever analysis the evaluator provides innarrative form” (Patton, 1990). Using these quotations and descriptions has helped allow the datato tell the story.“Thick, rich description” was also employed. As Patton (2001) said: “Thick, richdescription provides the foundation for qualitative analysis and reporting. Good description takesthe reader into the setting being described” (p.437). This kind of description is essential if theresearcher expects the reader to become involved and invested in the research report. For thisresearch, this kind of description was used to highlight the words of the participants, allowingthem to speak for themselves while at the same time giving context to their thoughts and actions.The goal in this research, as in all qualitative research, was to create as complete a pictureas possible, creating “spaces where those who are studied (the Other) can speak” (Denzin &Lincoln, 2005, p.26). It is hoped these shared stories will offer readers and participants insightsinto the ways in which the public libraries and librarians interacted with the service providersand the LGBTQ homeless youth in this case study and possibly lead to the creation ofpurposeful, positive and productive interactions in the future.95Chapter FourFindingsPreambleThe title of this chapter haunted me since the first words hit the page of this dissertation. Iread, researched, interviewed, thought, read more, did more research, interviewed more, thoughtmore and then read, thought, read. Not only was grounded theory new to me, so too wasresearch. I am a librarian - a practical person who looks for problems to solve and then tries tosolve them. You could say research was a problem to solve, but the answers were not clear ordefinite or finite or even unique. I also like to be prepared for the unexpected. So I took a longtime to end all my preparations and finally sit down to allow my brain to make connections andcome up with categories and to not keep retreating to the comforting words of Strauss, Corbin,Becker, Agar, Charmaz and all those other people who knew what they were doing. In my mind,I finally took off my training wheels and hoped I would not notice I was balanced on two wheelsinstead of four and that no longer did the comforting hand of my father rest on the back of myseat as I wove up and down the sidewalk on my own. That is to say: My desk was clear, therewere no books, no papers, no highlighters, no colorful Post-Its to mark important passages. Therewas just my computer, my fingers and my mind. I managed to take in a lot of other people’swords and I was finally ready to let out a few myself. Here they are.Introduction“My mom kicked me out for being myself and she doesn’t even know who I am” (Cedar, 2012)In this chapter are the stories that have come out of the grounded research in response tothe research question: “What is the role of the public library in the lives of homeless LGBTQyouth?” and to the secondary questions that arose during the research process. These included:96(a) “What does it mean to feel safe?” (b) “What is expected from the Library?” (c) “How doattitudes toward visibly homeless adults affect homeless LGBTQ youth?” and, (d) Howimportant are personal connections?”The interviews, field notes, memos, and examination of supplementary documents, suchas behavior guidelines in both organizations, have all contributed to these stories. The opencoding at the beginning led to a vast and unwieldy number of codes, which was winnowed downby careful thought, constant comparison and by returning to the data over and over again. Thisprocess, called open coding (Oktay, 2012, p.75) resulted in reducing the 1920 codes to 26concepts.These concepts were further reduced to 16 broad categories, then six theoretical concepts,and these were combined to create the final two core categories of “creating safety” and“developing cultural competence.” These two themes ran like a thread through the interviews,the collected written materials, the overheard conversations and the observations. Thedevelopment of these concepts, categories and themes is explained in the following sections, inalignment with a commitment to “increase the reliability of the information in a case study” bymaintaining a chain of evidence (Yin, 2009, p.122).I begin with a description of the institutions and the participants, using “thickdescription” as described in Chapter Three. Providing this kind of background gives a richer feelto the data, supplementing the large amount of quotations also included. This is followed by adescription of the codes, concepts, themes and central categories as they emerged from the data.Finally, this chapter ends with a presentation of the grounded theoretical scheme that has comeout of this research, with examples drawn from the data. Together it is hoped these provide97insight into the interactions of the three groups included in this case study: The librarians, theservice providers and the homeless LGBTQ youth.The InstitutionsThe City Library. The City Library was located in the City, a large urban area, known as a “gay-friendly”city and made up of neighborhoods that varied greatly in racial and economic diversity. Oneneighborhood, the Hayes, was particularly welcoming to those who identified as gay. Mostneighborhoods had branch libraries and these libraries tried to reflect the communities theyserved.The mission statement of the City Library included the City Library system “is dedicatedto free and equal access to information, knowledge, independent learning and the joys of readingfor our diverse community” (the City Library, 2012). The Library was comprised of one Mainlibrary (the Main) and 27 branches libraries. For fiscal year 2010 to 2011, they circulatedapproximately 10,707,477 items citywide and 2,744,956 items at the Main. That same year, theyhad 7,042,971 Library visits citywide, of which 2,225,291 were at the Main. The Main was openseven days a week, with shorter hours on Fridays and Sundays. There were 394,453 totalregistered patrons for that year, out of a population of 805,235 in the entire city.Located in a city known to be a leader in gay rights, the City Library was committed toserving the LG population. It had a branch designated as the LG branch and there was a gay andlesbian history center located at the Main. It had also highlighted teen services in the lateststrategic plan, placing a particular emphasis on creating a new teen center at the Main.98Main Library. The Main, the location for most of the Library observation and for thehomeless youth interviews, was opened in 1996 and was built to replace a library that was halfits size. The façade, made up of Sierra White granite, gave an imposing and elegant, if somewhatintimidating, look to the outside of this building, which offered 375,000 square feet of usablespace. Inside were a large central atrium - topped by a skylight - and an open floor plan with fivelevels, each accessible by elevators and wide sweeping staircases. It was near the City Hall, aswell as the opera house and symphony building. Yet the neighborhood surrounding it, TheShanty, was well known for its poverty and high rates of SROs (singe resident occupancyrooms). As a result, it was also home to social service agencies and churches dedicated toproviding resources for those who were experiencing poverty and homelessness, as well as theoutcome of these economic challenges - such as substance abuse and untreated or inadequatelytreated mental illness.The Main had a social worker on staff to engage with the visibly homeless adult patrons,of which there were many. There was a teen services coordinator, as well as a teen and children’sservices administrator. There was a large beautifully laid out children’s section and a small teenarea that had been carved out of a corner of the Library. The plans to create a new teen centerwere in the works and the goal was to have it be, as one of the librarians, Laura, described it,“state-of-the-art” and designed to appeal to all teens. When this research started, there were twofull-time teen librarians at the Main, but they both changed jobs within a week of each other andso the Main was without a teen librarian during the entire time interviews were being conducted.When one entered the Main, the first impressions were of the vastness of the space, theinvisibility of the books and the uniformed security guard seated on a stool next to the narrowentry way and tall security gates that led into the Library itself. It was easy to see why the five99homeless LGBTQ youth in the focus group had concerns about this floor of the Library. Appledescribed the security as “feeling like an airport” and Billy Bob, agreeing with her, added: “Likeif, if I was in the first floor of the public library in the City, I don’t feel so safe, ‘cause to me Ifeel like there’s a big amount of tension in that area.” Talyn commented:I agree with everyone, the first floor is intimidating…’cause, I mean I understandthey have to be on guard, you know, make sure no one’s gonna run off with abook or something, but that doesn’t mean that the whole atmosphere of the firstfloor has to feel like, you know, someone’s gonna grab you by the arm and yankyou, throw you outside at any given moment.Once through the security gates, the other floors of the Library felt less intimidating, withtheir combinations of open spaces and smaller rooms. It was on these floors that many of theinterviews were conducted, in the administrative offices - with the librarians - or in the studyrooms, with the youth.Juniper Youth Services. JYS, the agency that served the largest number of homelessyouth in the City, was located in this same low-income neighborhood. As previously described,JYS served about 3400 homeless youth annually, with services and housing programs. In 2011,JYS kept youth off the streets for 83,782 nights (Juniper Youth Services, 2011). Their missionwas “to provide a continuum of services that inspires homeless and runaway youth to movebeyond the streets. We will nurture potential, promote dignity, and support bold steps by all”(Juniper Youth Services, 2011). They had multiple service sites, including the two drop-incenters - Stop-By and the PRC - a health clinic, job and education training center, emergencyhousing, transitional housing, permanent housing, housing for underage youth (17 and under),housing for LGBTQ youth, housing for youth with severe mental illness and housing for former100foster care youth. They served ages 12 to 24, but the majority of the youth they saw werebetween 18 and 22 - what were called “transitional aged youth” (TAY). Approximately 70% ofthem were youth of color and 60% identified as male, 30% as female and 2% as transgender(JYS, 2010).Stop-By. Much of my observation time was spent at the drop-in center, Stop-By, whichfelt like the drop-in center for homeless youth it was. The contrast between the City Library andStop-By could not have been starker. Although the cement walls had been painted with primarycolors and there were brightly colored fliers on the walls, as well as youth artwork, and althoughthere was usually a friendly person at the front desk, it could not escape its institutional feel. Theodor of food stayed in the air, the stairs to the lower level were frequently littered with debrissuch as an odd blue plastic glove or an old comb or torn handouts, the dining and common-uselong wooden table was usually sticky, the four padded black Naugahyde benches were well wornand there were almost always two huge fans loudly attempting to cool down the space. It wasbarely clean but it was a welcoming place, where youth appeared to feel safe and free to bethemselves. JYS provided a description of Stop-By on their website:[Stop-by] is a safe haven for at-risk youth seeking help and is staffed by caringprofessionals who provide immediate intervention and short-term counseling to preparekids to start their journeys toward productive adulthood. [It] is more than just a place tohang out. It also offers connection to education and offers recreational activities wherethey can connect with peers and adults. Through groups, outings and one-on-oneconversations…staff support youth with a variety of special needs such as education,family reunification, legal matters, and sexual identity issues. It also serves as a portal tofurther services. Each new visitor to the Center receives an individual assessment to101determine what other services—such as medical care, counseling, or housing—wouldbest suit their immediate and long-term needs. For some young people…the Center is justa place to get away from the streets for a little while. But for most, it is a stop on the wayto continued recovery, offering a chance to rebuild their lives and leave the streets forgood. (Juniper Youth Services, 2012)The entrance to Stop-By was first through heavily barred metal gates that were unlockedduring the day, and then through a thick glass door, controlled by a buzzer at the main desk.Most days, this door was kept locked and each person had to be buzzed inside. However, somedays - especially sunny ones - the door was propped open and anyone could enter withoutscreening. However, once inside, youth were required to give their name and birth date to theperson at the front desk. Again, Stop-by could be contrasted with the Library, with its securityguard and posted behavior guidelines.Until 2012, Stop-By was only for youth 19 and under; the new age limit was 21, becausethere were so few places for TAY to safely spend their days. On weekdays, Stop-By was openfrom 8:15 a.m. until 6 p.m.; weekend hours were 8:15 a.m. until 4 p.m. During the week, threehot meals a day were served from the small kitchen in the back. On the weekends, two hot mealswere served. There were always snacks available, including fresh fruit and day-old bakery goods.In general, the food that was offered was a combination of bulk food - canned, frozen, packaged,large blocks of butter, bags of lettuce - added to the upscale foods, especially baked items, frombakery donations. So a meal could consist of bulk frozen beef, bulk frozen vegetables and day-old bread from the local upscale bakery.  There was constantly a hand-me-down feeling, andeven having volunteers, as opposed to enough paid staff, added to that feeling.102The small library at Stop-By was made up of one large wooden bookcase that took up alarge portion of one wall and a stand-alone small wooden bookcase with four shelves. Over theyear I volunteered there, I organized the bookcases into subject categories, identified by small,hand-written labels taped to the shelves. Initially, the shelves included an interesting combinationof obviously unwanted books donated by someone who just wanted to get rid of them (perhapsthe best example being Passages, a book about menopause by Gail Sheehy), 14 hardback NancyDrews, 25 Danielle Steele novels, primarily hardback, a substantial collection of juvenile fictionand then a random assortment of new and interesting novels and philosophy or spiritual books.Some of the books were Library discards, left over from an earlier collaboration with the Main.At the beginning it took several days to weed the collection, organize what was left and thenbegin to slowly add to it. At each visit, the youth were offered the opportunity to request specifictitles or genres and these requests were as diverse as any that can be found at a public library. Forinstance, the first list of requests included: Halo, Dante’s Inferno, Dr. Seuss books, The 33Strategies of War and the 48 Laws of Power by Robert Green, Hunger Games, QuantumConsciousness by Stephen Wolinsky, Girls Like Us by Rachel Lloyd and Sistah Souljah’sMidnight, The Tempest and books about New Orleans culture, especially Creole history. Inaddition, there were requests for true crime, biographies of fashion designers, sociology,psychology and mysteries. The ability to fill the requests was based on thrift stores finds, thegenerosity of friends and the Library book sales. In contrast, most if not all of these requestedmaterials were available for free at the Library, if these youth had had valid library cards and hadfelt welcomed and safe there.Personal interactions with the staff at JYS were generally pleasant and the staffconsistently expressed appreciation for the upkeep of the library. The youth tended to be reticent103unless directly addressed and then they were generally friendly, interactive and eager to discussreading and books. At one of the early visits, two young women, Apple and Riddles (who werelater part of the focus group), came over and asked: “Are you the librarian?” as if they wereasking about God or the President. This reaction offered insight into the innate power of the roleof librarian. It was also reminiscent of a homeless adult focus group in another city. Theparticipants there were initially under the impression the focus group they attended representedoutreach from the local library (it did not) and they were thrilled. Moments like those serve asreminders that public libraries are about relationships and how easy it is to forget that.The NeighborhoodThe Shanty. The Shanty was an area that encompassed a variety of housing,playgrounds, churches, schools, stores, restaurants and service agencies. A common sight in thisneighborhood were people sleeping: Along walls, in doorways, and even propped up against thewheels of cars. They frequently carried rough gray blankets, flecked with colors, which werehanded out by various agencies and used to lie on or under or to be wrapped around oneself.Odor. One of the best clues one was entering this neighborhood was the odor. Because ofmy unusually keen sense of smell, it was initially extremely difficult to endure the stench ofurine and other bodily odors. However, over time I came to understand the powerful connectionbetween smell and stigma and how that partially shaped these reactions. That is, the revulsion Ifelt was complex: It was not simply the odor, but it was the socialization I have received over alifetime of living an American middle class domiciled life. Sibley (1995) put it like this:The middle classes have been able to distance themselves from their own residues, but inthe poor they see bodily residues, animals closely associated with residual matter, andresidual places coming together and threatening their own categorical scheme under104which the pure and the defiled are distinguished. The separations which the middleclasses have achieved in the suburb contrast with the mixing of people and pollutingmatter in the slum. This then becomes a judgment on the poor. The class boundarymarked out in residential segregation echoes the recurrent theme: Evil…is embodied inexcrement. (p.56)The experience with the Shanty bore this out. I went from revulsion to making a newemotional link in which concern for the people I encountered on these streets transformed thissmell into the odor of inequality and a powerful class system. This transformation wasremarkable and it increased my commitment to this research.Walking to the Library. To get to the Library from Stop-By was a six block walk throughThe Shanty, down sidewalks where people leaned against graffitied walls, their shopping cartsparked nearby, or groups engaged in animated conversations, forcing pedestrians to weave in andout, as the groups gesticulated and shouted and laughed. It was a walk past multiple examples ofthe weaponized architecture mentioned earlier, like pointed boulders cemented into windowwells or benches that only accommodated one person or signs that threatened if one sits or liesdown. There was a thick heavy feeling in the air that stuck to my skin and pulled at my heart.This was the Library’s neighborhood. This was where some of these young people werespending their days and nights. This was their milieu and make no mistake - it affected them.This was not a place they wanted to call home.Grounded Theory CategoriesFirst open coding. The challenge in this case study was to see if there were commonthemes about the Library among the three groups: Librarians, homeless youth and serviceproviders. As mentioned earlier, the initial open coding resulted in 1920 codes. This coding was105the “first level of data analysis in grounded theory” (Oktay, 2012, p.70). These codes came out ofline-by-line coding as recommended by Charmaz (2006, p.51) and, as Oktay suggested,everything was coded (p.56), which could explain why there were so many codes. Also, sincethis case study included three groups, the vocabulary used varied with the participant because thestories were about three different worlds. As much as possible, codes that reflected actions wereused, such as “being a good partner,” “competing for funds” and “constantly being interrupted”(Charmaz, 2006).Second open coding. The next step was a continuation of the open coding. Because ofthe huge number of codes, narrowing the open codes made the data much more manageable.During this step, constant comparison and the memos were used to look for patterns and ideas onwhat these 1920 codes had in common. As the open codes were initially being assigned, patternshad already begun to emerge, allowing them to ultimately be combined into the 26 concepts thathelped group them together for this second open coding. For example, “figuring out how to workwith youth organizations” and “meeting with organizations” were subsumed under the concept of“creating connections.”This was a time-consuming and mind-stretching step, since there were so many codes.Initially, the same codes were incorporated into more than one concept.  This helped constructthe final 26 concepts, because it highlighted the relationships among them. The process requireda constant comparison of data to data, as patterns emerged.Axial coding. Once these 26 concepts were identified, the data was once more consulted,in an effort to look for descriptions or comments that would add to these. A definition of eachone was written, using the field notes, interviews and memos. This writing facilitated theidentification of connections between the concepts, using Oktay’s (2009) advice that some106concepts may turn out to be aspects of a category (p.65). For example, it was found that“collaborating,” “creating connections,” “interaction” and “outreach” could all be combined tocreate the category “connecting,” because they all include the idea of the importance of humaninteractions among people, whether they are the homeless youth, the service providers or thelibrarians. “Perception of youth” and “attitude toward youth” were also combined to create“attitude,” because they both included interactions or potential interactions with homelessyouth, driven by the context of the interaction. That is, certain attitudes about homeless youthaffected how they were treated or the assumptions that were made about them. “Welcoming,”“creating safety,” “creating an environment” and “anyone can come in” were all combined tocreate “creating safety,” because they related to the space and whether or not it was perceived tobe safe.“Anyone can come in” initially seemed to have great potential as a concept or even as abroad category, since it was used in different ways and how it was used and who used it greatlyaffected its meaning. Because the public library was just that - public - and because it wasfrequently described as a democratic institution, the concept of letting anyone come in could be apositive one. However, some librarians used it as shorthand, actually meaning “we have to letanyone in,” rather than meaning “we welcome anyone.” As Peter put it when asked how he likedbeing a librarian:What it comes down to, I guess, is, it’s a public building and everyone can come in.  And,so, we, we deal with that…It can mean all sorts of things, and it’s probably differentevery day, but it’s, there’s public, it’s a public building and anyone can come in…Wehave a set of guidelines… Library use guidelines that are posted by the entrance.  And107then we enforce ‘em and, and, as best we can.  Um, we also have security that, uh, backsus up.So for Peter, “anyone can come in” was directly associated with controlling behavior and tryingto create a safe environment for his patrons, as he defined safety. This concept ultimately becamepart of the broad category of “creating safety” and how the three identified groups defined it inrelationship to the Library.Another grouping was “work environment,” “work challenges” and “attitude toward job.”Since all three of these related to employment, it became clear they could be brought togetherinto one term, “work.”  “Work challenges” was created initially because one of the questions forthe librarians was about the barriers they encountered when trying to accomplish their jobs. Themost common barriers were time, funding and bureaucracy - with bureaucracy at the top of thelists. Only two of the librarians mentioned the presence of homeless Library patrons as barriersto doing their jobs. In one case, this frustration was with the amount of time it took to enforce thebehavior guidelines that were created because of patrons experiencing homelessness. In the othercase, the librarian had two particular frustrations: Library procedures and the lack of time toaddress an issue that felt important to her as a librarian and as a branch manager.  Here isDenise’s story about the problem with not offering restricted cards to all the homeless youth (oneof the clerical procedures mandated by the library), so they could use the Library Internetcomputers for an hour instead of waiting in line over and over again for the 15-minute computer.The people she described in this anecdote were all homeless youth:At first I was like, okay you need to get up, you cut the line [for the 15-minutecomputers]. But then I hear that this other guy called him a faggot and I’m like well youneed to leave, ‘cause you used hate speech. And then they both start going and I was like108oh for God’s sake, who knows…So I said nobody go anywhere, everybody stay exactlywhere you are, we’re gonna just like pretend we’re all fine. And then the guy over heregot upset because he thought I was favoring this guy, because this guy wasn’t homelessand this guy’s yelling well I am homeless, you asshole. And then he’s up, and he’s likeI’m homeless and I’m a faggot and then they’re screaming and…then it calms down, thenI went downstairs for a second…and then I came back upstairs and walked into the fight.Like I walked up that staircase, opened the door, and the guy who got the computer wasstanding over the other guy, like you’re not allowed to call people that, I can’t believethis, let’s take it outside, and…we kicked him out, we kicked him out again, the policeended up, like six police officers came, and maybe they looked for that kid out in thestreet, I don’t know what they were gonna do, no blows were thrown but…there was like20, 25 minutes in which the whole branch becomes like an insane place over the 15-minute computer.This anecdote was an excellent example of the overlap of some of the categories. Denise wasspending time to create safety using rules - all three of these were emerging categories.Broad categories. The following table shows the 16 broad categories that emerged fromthe axial coding. The included concepts are indicated in parentheses. Each category gives anexample for the three groups.109Table 2.

In another return to the data, each of the 16 broad categories wasconsidered again, using the following questions as guides: What were the stories that seemed tobe most important to the storytellers? Where was the passion or the commitment or the hurt orthe confusion? What was being said about the Library - by the youth, the librarians and theservice providers? How did the meanings attached to each of these broad categories by the youthand the service providers contrast or correspond with the meanings offered by the librarians?In an effort to refine these broad categories, theoretical sampling was also used. AsCharmaz (2006) explained: “Use theoretical sampling as a strategy to narrow your focus onemerging categories and as a technique to develop and refine them” (p.107). At this point, therewere many ideas about what was being discovered and the meanings that were emerging. Tofurther focus these categories and the ideas, interviews with all three groups were continued,especially focusing on the homeless youth. In addition, observations were continued at bothStop-By and the Main, and there were two more casual conversations with staff at Stop-By, aswell as attendance at an improvisational performance at Stop-By.111Theoretical concepts. Finally, from these 16 broad categories came six theoreticalconcepts: Time, attitude, welcoming, building relationships, feeling safe and culturalcompetence. Each of these theoretical concepts represented an aspect of the two final corecategories: Creating safety and developing cultural competence. The next sections explain howeach of these six were articulated by the three groups of librarians, service providers andhomeless LGBTQ youth, and how they supported the final theoretical scheme: In order for theLibrary to be able to provide relevant materials and services to the homeless LGBTQ youth, it isnecessary for the Library to be perceived as an emotionally safe and welcoming space by boththe youth and the service providers. In addition, the librarians need to feel both physically andemotionally safe in providing this space. To create this safety requires shared culturalcompetence between the Library and the other two groups.Time. The first theoretical concept was time and what it meant to each group. Early on inthe research, it appeared the core of this case study would be about time, because participants ineach group used the concept differently and yet each of them mentioned time in some way.Ultimately, time was included as one of the theoretical concepts that helped to build the finaltheory.For the librarians, there was never enough time to do the work they needed or wanted todo. It is interesting to note that the City Library, unlike many in the United States, had plenty ofmoney for materials but less money for staff. Dan described the difference between his ideas andhaving time to carry them out:I realized, “Wait a sec.  I don’t have time to do the programming.”  Like I’m still new atlibrarianship, even though I’ve been working twenty-two years, as far as like having thebudget, the responsibilities, I’m finding out, like, my ideas that are all pie in the sky are112not necessarily gonna get done and I have to figure out, I have to strategize and, um, andit takes me back to library school and strategic plans and all that stuff.Denise made a similar point:And I realized I can’t do everything so I thought I’m gonna pick these things I can do,and these are the thing - you know, I kind of looked through my evaluation and I thought‘well these are the things I can do’ and this is, you know, what’s having a big payoff, andthese other things we need to kinda table for right now, um, and try to get more resourcesfor them.Joyce talked about being constantly interrupted and how challenging it was to geteverything done. Not having enough time to do their jobs or to do their jobs well affected all ofthe librarians. This lack of time influenced the decisions they made about work priorities andtheir willingness to take on extra work, such as reaching out to underserved populations like thehomeless LGBTQ youth.As mentioned already, time was also a factor in computer use. The time limits, especiallyfor the 15-minute computers, created conflicts and the need for constant surveillance, taking timeaway from other tasks. The paperwork alone for some of the incidents took away valuable time.In her comments on the number of incidents in her branch, Denise described how time-consuming it was:If I spent those five hours I write incident reports a week on programming for homelessyouth…I mean, it sounds like, some weeks if there was more than five. It’s just, there area lot of, there’s a lot of paperwork associated with every goofy incident…So it’s really,um… it just seems like it’s a drain on our resources. And it’s associated with the numberof people who are in need.113Again, this lack of time served as a barrier to creating cultural competence in the lives ofthese youth. In addition, the youth and the service providers perceived the time limits on thecomputers as unwelcoming and rigid.Another aspect of time for librarians was the age limit on services to teens. In the CityLibrary, teens were considered adults when they reached the age of 19 and at that point theywere no longer served by the teen librarians. In some ways, this was not a negative for thispopulation, since many of them did not fit into the typical teen category and did not identify asteens. When I asked Isaiah about using the teen section in the Library, he told me:But I kind of feel to get more people in, to get this specific demographic [homelessLGBTQ youth]…that’s it’s important to have the young adult section, ‘cause I know a lotof people who do not wanna be called teenagers and wanna be perceived as young adults.And I think that wording itself is truly important for them.However, like other young adults their age, their needs were not being met by the adultlibrarians, either. When a librarian from the City Library called me to ask about the needs of thispopulation, she made a point of telling me that she did not know anything about teens becauseshe was an adult librarian (personal conversation, 2012). This gap was significant and it played arole in Library’s ability to provide meaningful services to LGBTQ homeless youth.The service providers also talked about time, but from a different angle. First, theyemphasized the importance of giving youth the time they need - to accomplish their goals, to feelsafe, to find their way. When asked about the rewards of hir job, Train described having a youngperson suddenly decide to get on the housing list:The rewards are when, after like three or four months of talking about like getting on ahousing waitlist, somebody actually says, “I need to do that now.” You know, like what114was the tipping point?  I don’t know, but now they’re coming and saying, “This is what Iwanna do, and I don’t wanna talk about it anymore.”As s/he pointed out, these youth were on their own timetables and the adults in their lives had torespect that. This attitude toward time and the youth fit well with the work of the librarians, sincein general they were providing services as needed, without expectations about what was beingdone with the services. It was also important for librarians to know this, since they expressedanxiety about being able to help these youth. Next, the service providers, like the librarians, were also constantly pressed for time.There was a significant staff turnover at JYS and many of the employees found themselves doingdouble or triple duty in their jobs. This was stressful on the staff as well as the youth, since itmade it more difficult for them to get services or even attention. Cedar commented on this whenI mentioned looking for a caseworker at Stop-By to interview:Good luck getting any of them. Um, there’s like four of them and they each have about ahundred cases. So they’re really, really swamped. Even when I try to talk to them, I couldget like five minutes and then they’d be like all right, well, we’ll talk to you later.This lack of time impacted the service providers’ ability to reach out to organizations, such as theLibrary, and the turnover made it challenging to create ongoing relationships.Time for the homeless LGBTQ youth revealed yet another aspect of time. Unlike theservice providers and the librarians, some of the youth had unlimited daily time, controlled onlyby having to show up for evening housing or daily meals. For many of them, this time was spentwaiting: For housing, for meals, for paperwork, for classes, for a meeting with a caseworker.Cedar described the waiting process for transitional housing:There’s a waiting list…I’ve been on it for twenty-something days. It’s been, it’s long. But115I think I’m next on the list or at the top of the list anyway so that’s a positive part. Butyou know, you call every day or check in every day and, it’s just a very long waitingprocess. But until then, you’re either hoping to get an emergency bed or you’re homelessor if you’re lucky enough to have some type of income, you can buy a hotel room. Butyou’re pretty much on your own at that point.With waiting came a need for a safe place to spend this time - and this was one reason they usedthe City Library. However, since they remained invisible at the Library, the librarians had noidea of how important this sanctuary was to these young people. This waiting time could alsoalternate with periods of activity. As Daniela explained:Our youth who are in college are pretty busy… a lot of them also have a job that they’reholding as well. And, then…if they’re participating in our employment programs, theyusually have a full schedule until that program ends, and a lot of the reason is becausethey’re not only doing this, you know, employment piece, but then they’re alsoparticipating in our computer class. And now that we’re gonna add another hour for GEDclass, too, and that’s when we’re able to really work with someone, and so they, youknow, if that program lasts for four weeks, then, yeah, you’re gonna have a real busy fourweeks.When the youth were busy, the City Library also represented a safe place to study or get privatetime away from the streets and the stress.Time for the youth also meant having time to try and fall short of their own expectationsand try again. This was a critical part of the JYS services: Offering these young people the timeto keep coming back, without judgment. Daniela described this:I mean that they’re just really resilient young people… they want to make a change and116there are just so many things that are going on and it can be very challenging and…it’slike sometimes it may not have worked out that time, you know, but being there andletting them know that it’s okay to come back and if it doesn’t work out that we’re stillhere and I think that’s been something that’s been really important, you know, for me inthe work that, we do. Because sometimes, you know, youth completing this one-weekclass, that may be the only thing that they’ve ever completed ever.This aspect of time related directly to the approach already being used by one of the teenlibrarians in particular. Dan described some of the teens at the City Library and observed that,contrary to what one might think, his enforcement of the rules actually helped him create betterrelationships with the teens who were acting out. As he put it:Um [pause] in the process of kicking teens out, it’s, it’s like, it’s a weird like, it’s astrange like paradox, but in, as I’m on my way out to kick kids out, often, I say thingslike, “I really like seeing you in the Library, but this is a place for everybody,” and I tryto get them into the philosophy of the Library, like, “You’re an adult.  You’re makingyour own decisions now. This is part of that life skill, like learning how to behave indifferent places.  I know you go out on the street and you say all kinds of swear words,but you come in here, you gotta chill on that stuff.”Initially, Dan found himself kicking out the same youth over and over. But over time, hedeveloped rapport with them and they became his most consistent and dedicated Library users.The use of a large amount of Dan’s time initially seemed overwhelming, but he found it to be aworthwhile investment, allowing him to create an environment that felt safe and welcoming forall the teens.One final point about time and these young people was that at 25 the youth aged out of117the JYS services and were no longer able to take advantage of the multiple opportunities toimprove their lives and get off of the streets. This was similar to the aging out of the teen Libraryservices and in both cases, it left these young people unsupported as they coped with issues thatwere not the same as the ones for more mature adults.Attitude. The second theoretical concept was attitude, because there were manycomments about the attitudes of librarians, youth and service providers.In his work as a teen librarian, Dan emphasized that he cared most about the youth andwhat they needed. He felt as if in some ways he was outside the usual Library attitude towardlinking teens with books. As he said:The books are secondary. I care about, ‘What are you into? What do you wanna do at theLibrary? What do you wanna do with your life? How are you gonna come here to dothat? What,’ you know, ‘What can you find here that’s gonna help you pursue educationinterests, music?’” whatever the thing is that they wanna get into.Dan’s attitude toward the youth was accepting and committed; he wanted them to have a positiverelationship with libraries.Joyce’s description of a young apparently homeless youth gave insight into the lack ofinformation and the comfort level concerned Library staff have in reaching out to homelessyouth:He was just, you know, he looked like a scared dog, you know, he was not kempt and…Ijust, I always got so sad just seeing, you know, seeing him, and he seemed so nervous.Um, and I would talk to him a little bit, but I didn’t wanna scare him off.Joyce’s attitude, like that of the others, showed that these librarians were paying attention andwanted to help, but they were not sure how to do that.118Although Theresa was not a librarian, she worked for the City Library and infrequentlyengaged with homeless youth at the Main, as part of her work with homeless adults there. Eventhough technically she was able to provide referrals to City resources to the youth who were 18and over, she was reluctant to do so. Her experience as a previously homeless person herself, andas a lesbian, gave her insight into the challenges of being young, LGBTQ and using the cityhousing services. In fact, when homeless, she herself chose to live on the street, rather thansubjecting herself to the shelters. Although there was not much she could do, her attitude wasprotective:I mean they’re my children. We have to look out for them. They’re fragile, vulnerableyou know…What’s not cool is that I just don’t know if they followed through. Becausemy inclination is to take them by the hand and walk them over to JYS because I don’tknow… The only thing I can say to them is, “Go there. If you don’t like it, if you didn’tget what you need from them, you come back, and we’ll do it from here. But I reallythink that this is a better fit for you. I think you’re gonna like this a lot better than you’regonna like what we have to offer.”Theresa’s concern for these youth was reflected in the way she interacted with them and worriedabout them. Because there was no one else at the City Library who was specifically assigned towork with them, she found herself stepping outside of her role because she cared and becauseshe understood their challenges on the streets.Denise was the librarian who interacted most consistently with the homeless youth, andshe seemed to have an attitude that combined affectionate humor, concern and a yearning forconcrete ways she could help them. In the past, she had worked with local social service agenciesand, although it was time-consuming, she found it helpful to be sharing information about this119population so she could provide appropriate Library services. Overall, she felt isolated in herbranch and frustrated by the lack of institutional Library support.The service providers’ attitude toward the homeless youth was well represented by Train,when I asked hir what s/he thought of the term “at-risk”:I think it describes every youth. It also is kind of lame. When I used to work atAmeriCorps and we would talk about our youth, we would call them “at-promise” youth.I’ve never heard that since then, though. So it’s just another way of like framing whowe’re working with. Like people with a lot of promise, people with a lot of I don’t know,interests and skills in the world, you know, who can do amazing things…I just feelthey’re some of the wisest people.Other service providers had a similar attitude and Lance’s comments summed up thisattitude well. When I asked him what he would like librarians to know about the young people heworked with, he answered: “That they’re not horrible street kids and drug addicts and negativity.They’re beautiful, sweet, wonderful young people trying to find their way in the world.” Both ofthese JYS staff members admired the youth, not only for their resilience, but also for theircreativity and intelligence. If shared, these attitudes would have provided useful insights to thelibrarians.Finally, the homeless youth participants talked mainly about attitudes that made them feelless safe or less confident. There is an extensive discussion of this in the section on feeling safe.But one pertinent comment came from Cedar about why he was willing to be interviewed. Hepointed out that normally he’s suspicious of straight people trying to help: “It kind of gets to thepoint where because you’ve been so mistreated by heterosexuals, you kinda become aheterosexualist. And like, you don’t trust heterosexual people, you’re like, why are you doing120this?” But he made an exception in this case, saying: “But I know for me, like, I mean the onlyreason I’m really doing this is because you said you’re a LGBT-friendly librarian and I’m likeokay, let’s see how we can advance the youth homelessness LGBT, you know?” One interestingpoint about his comments is that he was not actually told I was an LGBT-friendly librarian. Hewas simply told the topic of the research. The fact that a librarian was interested in what thepublic library could do to make his life better made him perceive me as LGBT-friendly; it mademe an ally. This interaction emphasized the importance of letting these youth know librarians arewilling to listen and offer resources. He viewed me positively after one brief conversation.Welcoming. The third theoretical concept was “welcoming.” Included in this theme wereboth feeling welcomed and being welcoming. Feeling welcomed was defined as having one’spresence enthusiastically anticipated, with thoughtful attention to specific needs. It was not thesame as tolerance, acceptance or inclusion. In a welcoming library atmosphere, each person whoenters feels comfortable and wanted. Welcoming could be a natural outcome of creating culturalcompetence, which will be discussed shortly.The librarians described welcoming in multiple ways. Like several of the other teenlibrarians, Katherine identified with teens. She explained why she chose to work with teens:Teen librarians are teen librarians because we realize how isolated teens are and how,how they don’t feel welcome in libraries and they need libraries so much. And we’re justdrawn to that demographic in a way that a lot of adults are scared of that demographic, soit’s just more, um, in the forefront of our mind to try and help them, and make, findloopholes for them. It’s just where our focus is. Where adult librarians are often shushingthem and, and dreading when a pack of, you know, African American fifteen-year-oldscomes in the Library, like “Eew, I’m gonna have to tell them to be quiet,” or their121behavior isn’t appropriate or whatever and the rest of us are like, “Oh, my god, this isgreat! Look at who just came in!”Katherine’s efforts to help the teens feel welcomed were particularly focused on personalinteractions with each one: She learned their names, she remembered what they were reading;she handed them books she thought they would like. Like other librarians, providing relevantresources was her way of trying to make her patrons feel welcome. Katherine’s positive andwelcoming attitude toward teens was based in large part on her comfort with this population - hercultural competence in the teen culture. This demonstrated the importance of understandingLibrary patrons, no matter who they were, and how that understanding led naturally to awelcoming environment.    Joyce also had personal interactions with the teens. Joyce had an informal TAG, whoprovided input on ideas for programming. Her “posse,” as she called them, was one way sheinteracted with the teens so they would feel connected to the Library.In addition, Joyce created displays with LGBTQ books, particularly for Pride Month. Forher, this was a way of letting LGBTQ youth know she wanted them there. Peter also designeddisplays and made a point of using prominently placed signs to highlight the extensive teenLGBTQ collection housed at his branch. Again, he was using his collection to indicate awelcoming environment. These librarians demonstrated a willingness to be welcoming and apositive attitude toward their LGBTQ teen patrons.The service providers had a lot to say about libraries being welcoming places. Lance, inparticular, was not happy with the reports he was getting from the LGBTQ homeless youth heencountered in his work:First off, they don’t feel welcomed [at the Library], even though they’re LGBTQ youth,122they are LGBT youth street youth and there’s a stigma to that…This one young personsaid it very accurately, “We’re not offered the same services as someone who comes indressed nicely and smells good.” And I’m like, seriously, he goes, “They treat us as ifwe’re dirt.” Not answering questions, ignoring them when they ask questions, and askingthem to leave because they smell bad. Not being helpful, being rude, condescension ishuge. They’ve actually given examples of where someone was like, there are three ofthem standing there and two…didn’t look like homeless kids; they would help those twofirst, and then turn, and in a rude way say, “What do you need?” And they don’t feel partof, they don’t feel welcomed.Lance was actually quite hostile toward the Library and did not use it himself, either. There ismore about the ramifications of this in the section on cultural competence.Train gave advice on how the Library could be more welcoming to homeless LGBTQyouth. Hir comments echo the recommendations in Chapter Two on how to help teens in generalfeel welcomed in a library:I think that if librarians are trying to be like allies or advocates or, or whatever, they needto be doing their own individual outreach, too. And that means making sure that anyqueer youth that come in that are noticeably queer youth or who have identifying,symbols or whatever, are feeling welcomed and are welcomed and are…encouraged toreturn and encouraged to ask any questions that they have and, and offered any resourcesthat somebody might know about that could be helpful to them. I mean librarians beingaware of just the vulnerability that certain young people are experiencing, especiallywhen they’re queer and when they’re marginally housed. Obviously, you can’t alwaystell who those people are, but, yeah, like having signs up and having flyers out for sure,123and then just being, yeah, really aware of who’s around and making sure to do your ownpersonal connection and outreach, you know, like, “I’m so-and-so. Let me know if youhave any questions,” making sure that they feel warmth from you because they’ll see youas an ally at that point, like knowing that, “Oh, wow. You treated me like a person, ahuman being. You respected me. And you actually were interested in getting to know myname, even. And usually people don’t trust me ‘cause I’m young and also I’m a little bitstrange and,” you know, these sorts of things. That’s like the experience of most youngpeople, though, as feeling like they aren’t respected or feeling like they’re always beingwatched or like they don’t have anything to offer or give in the world, so making surethat, to offer that and being warm about it, and creating like that ally-ship from the veryget-go.It can be seen from this quote that welcoming and attitude in the Library were closely connected,as were feeling welcoming and building relationships. All three were ultimately incorporatedinto the central categories of feeling safe and cultural competence.The atmosphere at the JYS sites was also welcoming, particularly at Stop-By. The feelingof casual disorder combined with a pleasant staff made it feel like a place where youth werewelcome to be themselves. The small interactions between staff and youth were consistentlyrespectful and helpful. For example, sample sizes of deodorant, soap, lotions, toothpaste andother hygiene items were kept behind the main desk. Over and over during time spent therevolunteering, I heard the youth ask for these. The response was invariably friendly andresponsive: “Sure, how many would you like?” said with a smile and handful of samples. Thenthe staff person would ask “How are you doing?” to let the young person know they cared. Thisattitude offered the youth a respite from the frequently negative interactions they encountered on124the streets and, for some of the youth, in the Library.The youth also had comments about the City Library and feeling welcome. Talyncommented on how unwelcome s/he felt at the Library. In a focus group discussion about thelegality of requiring a person to show paperwork for a service animal, Talyn offered:I feel that they, uh, kind of pick and choose who to stop, play favoritism to some extenttowards who goes in and who doesn’t.  It’s usually based on just how the person looks,which isn’t really good, ‘cause like we’re just trying, you know, to do what we need todo, go to the Library if we need, maybe use a computer if we need it, but if we’re notallowed in because some security guy at the front is obviously, blatantly breaking the lawby saying you can’t, “I need to see the service tags for this animal,” then it’s like [pause]what are we supposed to do?This conversation offered insight into the power of the lack of knowledge about the rules of theLibrary and the law and it spoke to the need for Library cultural competence training for theyouth. Like the previous quote, it also reinforced the relationship between feeling welcomed andattitude.Cedar had mixed feelings about what it was like at the City Library. He was excitedabout the LGBT history room at the Library and it made him feel as if his interests had beenanticipated:  “There’s a the section for LGBT which, when I went in there, it blew my mind. I’mlike, oh my god you have a whole section devoted to this!” When asked for his opinion onwhether the LGBTQ materials in the main part of the Library should be in a separate, labeledsection, so they were visible and welcoming or interfiled, so a person using them would not feelconspicuous, he made a good case for having a separate section:I definitely like [that] option, just the we’ll put ‘em all together, ‘cause otherwise it kinda125just seems like it’s hidden to me, you know. Don’t hide that stuff. Those are probably themost useful books that questioning teens are ever going to read. Because you have suchan easy access to the Bible which is condemning you and telling you that you’re evil andgoing to Hell. And then you have such little access to the books that are telling you, noyou’re not alone, you don’t have to commit suicide, you don’t have to cut, you don’t haveto go through the pain, you know. Because you’re normal. But, when you read the Bibleespecially in such a religious family like I grew up with, you know, all you’re hearing is,you’re wrong, you’re defying God, you’re, you’re going to Hell, like, so it’s definitely,the access of the books. And I feel like if people could more easily access those booksmaybe we would see a decline in suicide.Cedar’s reflections on the power of having the LGBTQ literature visible fit well with the basicconcepts of librarianship - especially, intellectual freedom and the right to access.Cedar came from a conservative community, with no support for its LGBTQ youth. Hecame to the City because he had heard it was a welcoming place for LGBTQ people, especiallyin the Hayes. Even before he was kicked out of his home for being gay, he had negativeexperiences related to his sexual orientation. He contrasted these with the welcome he felt in theCity:[At home] I was walking down the street holding my ex-boyfriend’s hand and there weretwo police standing at the corner and the one turned to the other and said “faggot”…It’s acompletely different feel where, the first day I was here [in the City], I talked to apoliceman for about half an hour, and he was really supportive of LGBT andhomelessness, and he was like, “You know what, fuck conservatives.” I was like “What?This is a policeman!”126Again, there was a relationship between feeling welcomed and relationships - in this case,there were examples of both positive and negative interactions and the effects they had on theseyouth. Welcoming is also closely linked to attitude - a good attitude makes a person feelwelcomed, a negative attitude creates the opposite effect, as mentioned in Chapter Two. Theattitudes and welcoming these youth felt in the Library contrasted in some ways with the onesthey experienced in the City. Their expectations about arriving in this gay-friendly city were notalways met by the City Library itself because, although the librarians had positive attitudes, theydid not have the knowledge necessary to create a welcoming environment for these youth.Building Relationships. Building relationships was the fourth theoretical concept. All ofthe groups commented on the importance of relationships for their work or their lives.The librarians talked about working with City agencies, schools, the Boys and Girls Cluband others. For example, Laura described the efforts of the Library to create partnerships:I mean at my level, we definitely are looking at the higher-level strategic partners, so I’mlooking at things like funding, shared assets…The staff partner at different levels, so wehave a Job and Career Center and they would be responsible for identifying all thepotential partners in the world of small business, job training, you know, and everythingfrom City departments to private enterprise to nonprofits. So part of it isgeography…each branch would be responsible for knowing the partners and theirpotential partners in their neighborhood, and some of it is service-oriented, again like thejob and career center…In the Shanty, we have had an increased effort in services foradults and services for young children, so we have partnerships with all of the careproviders and we do some outreach to make sure that they have that information aboutour early literacy programs…and then you bring them back into the Library and we have127a large beautiful children’s center to accommodate them and do programs for them andall this stuff.Helen described the Library’s emphasis on collaborations through programming:Well, we have a lot of collaborations, because we do programming, so throughout theLibrary system, the branches each have their neighborhood organizations that they haverelationships with, and here we have lots of organizations, so with our art and musiccollection, we have relationships with the symphony and with the ballet and the Opera.And then, um, the International Center has relationships with consulates and embassies,and so it just runs the gamut. It depends, again, what the focus is. The City HistoryCenter has a lot of relationships with City organizations. And Alexandra in YouthServices will have relationships throughout the City with, mostly, schools. I mean that’show, I think, the youth, kids through teen, are mostly connected to the Library is throughschools summer reading program.From these examples, it was clear the City Library was comfortable reaching out to someagencies and organizations. For youth-related partnerships, many were through the traditionalvenue of schools, especially the annual summer reading program. However, as one serviceprovider pointed out, this left out many of these youth, who were no longer attending school -because they did not have reliable places to live or because they had left the cities where theywere in school or because of bullying in the schools. Also, these partnerships were frequentlycentered on one-time programs, where the City Library provided a venue for the organization.These collaborations were convenient for both parties, but provided little in-depth knowledgeabout each other.Peter, who was gay and the chair of the City Library’s LGBT committee, had made an128effort to reach out to the local LGBTQ youth organizations, but with little success:We’ve tried, actually, to get, to do outreach with QYRR [Queer Youth Recreation andResources] in the neighborhood.  We tried, and have been trying. But it hasn’t reallyworked…  I know the kids come in here [the City Library]…I’ve had a hard timecontacting them or getting, you know, return calls and things.  I don’t know that they’rereally a place that wants you knocking on their door and coming in…you know, ‘cause Ithink they try to maintain a safe teen space and are, and are controlling about adults thatcome in…[But] we could have a group come, like a group activity or something, youknow, and I’ll give a tour and show things around, but it’s never came to fruition, so…Peter went on to talk about giving up on QYRR, because he’s so busy:And then, I, you know what happens is you just kind of move on…not deliberately, butyou end up, you know, “Why won’t these people answer the phone?” so I’m gonna gohere and then you start working on something else and your pile, or whatever, yourmemo to call them gets put on a different place on your desk and gets piled up.This disappointed Peter particularly because he was passionate about the City Libraryreaching out to the communities. He was a good example of willingness on the part of theLibrary to engage more fully with local organizations and community members and the amountof time this could take. He described an idea he had to connect the Library to the neighborhood,having librarians go out with I-Pads and showing potential Library patrons the resourcesavailable at their local branch. He explained his vision of outreach and creating relationships:“The most meaningful questions you end up answering are when you’re at a class visit or at acommunity event or whatever, and you can link the person directly with the Library right thenand there.” He also pointed out that this could work well for homeless youth: “With homeless129teens or whatever, if you had your iPad all linked up with the Library material and stuff, youcould show them right there.”One of the challenges, though, was keeping up with the changes in staff at the variousagencies. Librarian Alexandra talked about the frustration of reaching out to someone who is nolonger doing that job:It’s so much about that person, just one-on-one thing with a service provider.  I was onthe radar with people who have since moved on or now they’re working in anothercapacity, and they’re like, “Oh, yeah, I ‘member when we worked on that together, butI’m not with them anymore,” and I’m like, “Oh, darn.”  So, it’s just staying on the, onthat path [pause] and I have to get more, get more proactive.This reinforced the earlier comments about the high staff turnover at JYS and the effect it couldhave on partner organizations, such as the City Library.Laura’s previous remarks provided an excellent example of the efforts being made by theLibrary to provide services to two populations: Adult and children. However, the LGBTQhomeless youth were not included in either, although some of them qualified based on age alone.However, as already mentioned, although technically adults, some of their needs were unique totheir housing situations and past experiences as young members of a stigmatized minority. Someof the resources Laura mentioned, such as the Job and Career Center, would have been ideal forthese young people, but since there were no targeted efforts to partner with JYS and there waslittle understanding between the two organizations on the cultures of each, the youth were nottaking advantage of this resource.Alexandra also described not knowing exactly how to partner with an organization, evenif both the Library and the organization were interested in working together: “You know, I’ll go130to a member of an organization. They’ll be like, ‘Yeah, that’d be cool. Hmm. What’d you havein mind?’ I’m like, ‘I don’t know. What do you have in mind? Like I wanna meet your needs,’you know.” Alexandra wanted to know what the other organization needed but was not sure howto gather that information.Peter had a similar reaction. He said he would like to help these youth, but simply did notknow what to do. When asked if he would be interested in learning more about how to meet theneeds of the homeless LGBTQ youth, he answered:Yeah, knowing how to, because…(a) that’s more people using the Library, (b) that’smore people using the Library and, (c) that’s more people using the Library. And so a lotof it is you don’t know how to, with a lot of things…I wouldn’t know where to beginalways.Peter’s comments, too, attested to the need for creating opportunities between the Library and theservice agencies that could lead to mutual understandings about each other.The service providers were committed to working with other agencies, since partnershipswere critical for JYS, both to aid in serving the youth and to increase revenue. The partnershipscreated by JYS stood in contrast to ones made by the Library. As Train emphasized, they learnedabout each other, so they could feel confident they were referring the youth to the appropriateplace. These kinds of relationships fostered deeper mutual understanding that served the youthwell. When asked about relationships with other agencies, Train pointed out that it was essentialin social services to create alliances:We’ll build relationships with other groups or other programs and organizations in thecommunity. The MoveIt Foundation, for example, ‘cause some of our youth have utilizedtheir emergency crisis services, and so they’re interested in working more competently131with us. We’ve met and done trainings back and forth, so we’ll learn more about them,they’ll learn more about us and so it’s more about like figuring out how can we utilizeother services for the needs of some of our clients that we can’t necessarily meet. Andthen like also letting them know about what we do have, so if they ever needed to referyoung people, they would feel confident in knowing where they’re referring them to. Sothat’s one of things I do.The partnerships that Train engaged in did not include the Library, even though the Lakebranch was a block away from hir JYS location, and even though both s/he and the branchlibrarian, Denise, knew there were homeless LGBTQ youth spending time at the Library.  ForTrain, hir reasons for this were twofold. First, when asked about reaching out to the Library, s/hesaid: “Yeah, I, I guess that would be like a project that I don’t have time to take on and off thetop of my head, I’m not quite sure how [pause] I would do, go about that.” Second, when askedif s/he thought there might be a stereotype of libraries that would act as a barrier, s/he told meabout an experience there:Well, I had a terrible experience with a librarian over there one day myself. She was sorude.  So I can only imagine how she would treat like a youth who was street-engaged,you know…So, yeah, I mean it’s funny, ‘cause like that was the only experience I’ve hadwith a bad librarian, um, but that’s somebody my kids are seeing every day possibly.So for Train, time, knowledge and a bad experience all served as barriers to reaching out to hirlocal branch.None of the participants at JYS had thought of reaching out to the Library to create thesepartnerships, but most of them were open to the idea. As Abbie commented:So I think that would be, actually, a really important part is that service providers get132connected with the librarians and if there is an event about usability of the Library orresources at the Library, that both parties are involved and working together.Even Lance, who had hostile feelings about librarians, was willing to work with them.When asked if he was interested in collaborating with the Library, he offered a surprising reply:“Of course. I’m all about collaboration…I mean, our lifeblood is collaborating. I have forty-seven sites where I put interns. I do all kind of things to help to build relationships andcollaborate.” When asked if he had ever placed interns at the Library: “Never been asked…no, Ihave not...Would I? Yes, if I felt it was a safe, supportive environment. Most definitely.”Lucille found out about what other agencies were doing by attending meetings: “There’sno shortage of opportunities for meetings in City. It’s how we do work here.” However, she hadnever attended a meeting with the Library or invited them to be part of her meetings. Whenasked why, she explained she had not thought of it. This lack of awareness on the part of theservice providers was another barrier to building a relationship between JYS and the Library.Creating awareness was necessary as a precursor to creating meaningful partnerships. This wasan integral part of the final core category of “developing cultural competence.”For the homeless youth, creating connections to other youth and to adults was a criticalaspect of feeling safe and there is more discussion about this in the final section on feeling safe.However, Lucille’s comments on the way in which the partnerships with other organizationsimpacted the youth offered valuable insights: “The work with the other organizations is alsoabout creating community, opportunities for youth leadership, opportunities for youth to cometogether and opportunities for them to work with staff.”  These partnerships were initiated byJYS, but they resulted in creating community and relationships for the youth. Deborahmentioned one of these in her interview. I asked her if she would be interested in serving on a133youth advisory board for the Library, and she answered in the affirmative, alluding to her workon the City TAY advisory board. She explained there were 20 youth from around the city whogot together once a month and they worked on a variety of issues:They do a lot of advocacy work for…transitional, foster and homeless youth in City, likebills in City Hall or [pause] like the free bus passes. They try to go to hearings andadvocate for youth and the things that we need, like housing…issues aboutemployment…they’re creating a new website.  That’s what we’ve been talking about alot, too.  Issues at City Hall and homeless youth and how they would, they’re like, I think,laws that they’ll pass, how they’ll affect us.The relationships Deborah made by serving on this board allowed her to engage withother youth and to feel less isolated.Feeling safe. The fifth theoretical concept was “feeling safe” as it related to participantsand the Library. The concept of feeling safe was used broadly for this research. It includedphysical safety: Knowing what it is to feel free from harm and the anxiety about being harmed.Feeling safe also included emotional safety: Feeling supported, respected, heard, seen, worthy,knowledgeable, included, empowered, comfortable. From the words of the service providers tothe anxieties of the librarians to the stories of the youth, this was the story over and over again.The youth needed and wanted to feel safe at the Library, by remaining invisible, by taking careof themselves, by learning how to get by, by reaching out for help. The librarians wanted tocreate and maintain a safe place for their Library patrons, as well as themselves. The serviceproviders wanted to feel safe interacting with the librarians and wanted the youth they served tobe safe. Feeling safe served as a cornerstone for the mission for JYS and the behavior rules forthe Library. It was one of the primary factors behind the reason these young people were living134on the streets and the reason they needed to get off of them. The following section describes howeach of the three groups experienced and defined feeling safe.To the librarians, feeling safe meant physical and emotional safety, both for themselvesand for their Library patrons. One way they tried to create this safety was through the use ofpublic conduct policies. In the last few years, the City Library had gone through a majorexamination of their policies, creating a substantial list of what were called “BehaviorGuidelines,” with an accompanying list of consequences (Appendix H). As Laura described this:We had had behavior guidelines for a very long time, but about five or six years ago, westarted putting some consequences to them…and we refined and refined and refined andrefined them, and we finally had, had for the last like seven, five years or so, a prettygood set of, “If this, then that,” to be able to follow. And then it’s been a matter oftraining our, our staff… It really helps when people wonder what’s gonna happen tosomebody who keeps sleeping in the Library, what’s gonna happen to somebody whovandalizes our material, and we can point to the intent is, “If they do it one time, this iswhat happens.  The second time, and a third time, this is what happens.”  It spells outwhat happens when people break the law versus when they just violate our guidelines.One primary factor that motivated many of these guidelines was the large homelesspopulation in this city, including both the youth, who tended to remain invisible, and the highlyvisible homeless adults. Particularly for the Main, located in the Shanty, administrators andLibrary staff were looking for ways to ameliorate the effect this population was having on theCity Library. However, a side effect of these rules was that they also impacted the hiddenhomeless, such as these youth.135In theory, these guidelines were applied consistently so Library staff could feelcomfortable having rules to rely upon and so patrons could know what to expect in the Library.Creating a safe environment in this case was a matter of controlling behavior as well as possible.Overall, that was what happened: There were rule infractions and they were dealt with promptlyand even-handedly. However, there were exceptions, because sometimes compliance was notpossible. For example, a person might not be able to leave their large bag outside, because itcontained everything they owned and yet Library rules prohibited her or him from bringing it in.As Peter described it:So, you know, oftentimes folks in that situation, right, they carry their belongings withthem. So…there’s rules on the number of your items that you bring in, and then there’sguidelines on the size of your items and where you can put those. So, you can’t bring allthese items in and block an aisleway or a walkway…That’s for everyone, you know,that’s how we can stay ADA compliant, by not hindering access, but also just for thegeneral, for everyone, for staff and the public so they can move freely around in theLibrary.He went on to explain that the items had to be “within sight” of the owner, which - he added -“probably leaves some room for interpretation.” “Room for interpretation” was how the Librarywas able to remain flexible even when governed by such clearly written behavior guidelines.Because exceptions were made. A patron with a hearing aid was allowed to speak more loudlythan someone without one. Babies emitted strong odors. Double strollers found their way into theaisles. By being flexible with these patrons, librarians were demonstrating not only their concernfor safety, but also their cultural competence in these areas. They took into account the needs ofthese patrons and adjusted their rules accordingly.136So while these behavior guidelines existed to create a feeling of safety for staff andpatrons, safety also lay in being able to treat each person as an individual, with unique needs.That was one of the biggest challenges for these librarians: They were there to serve the publicbut not everyone was the same. They had varying needs, a range of reasons for being at theLibrary, even different reasons for breaking the rules. In addition, how these rules wereperceived affected how each person felt being in the Library. This was difficult for the librarianswho wanted to make the Library a safe and comfortable place for all patrons.Consequently, for some of the librarians, these new guidelines posed a problem for theirpatrons and therefore for them. Denise was torn between enforcing rules to keep the buildingfeeling safe and, at the same time, providing a safe physical space for the young homeless youthwho found their way to the Library. She described an incident in which a homeless young manwho kept falling asleep at the Library was “totally bloodied” when he arrived. It was youngpeople like that who made her question the new guidelines:So we were working on kind of a three strikes you’re out sleeping rule, and it was for oneday. Now it’s one strike you’re out for one day, two you’re out for like two days - thefirst one’s a warning, the second time you’re out for the day, and third time you’re out forthree days, and then the fourth time three days, fifth time three days, sixth time threedays, so if you wanna come in the branch you soon figure out you can’t sleep. And if youneed to sleep you soon figure out you can’t do it in the branch. But it used to be that itwas much more lenient. So we saw a lot more sleepers, and, when I asked one guy whyhe was, this one, younger guy [the one who was bloodied], why he was sleeping and whathad happened, it was basically the case that he could sleep in the daytime here but hecouldn’t sleep anywhere else because he would be jumped and beaten up at night.137Denise also pointed out that the youth were not allowed to sleep in the parks, althoughsome of them went there at night anyway. When I asked her where they were allowed to sleep,she told me “no place.” This was an excellent example of how the behavior guidelines may offersafety to some patrons and take it away from others. She was aware of this and as she wasdeveloping cultural competence in the world of homeless youth, she felt the dissonance betweenthe impact of the rules on these youth and the domiciled Library users. Her desire to serve theseyouth as best she could also put her in conflict with her Library system, thereby making her feelunsafe in her work place. Feeling safe for Denise also included receiving training and information for dealing withpatrons who appeared to need social services. As she put it:I’m not doing much referring of people to the right services so much as I’m trying tomaintain the safe environment within the confines of the building. Which I think is roomfor improvement or for a philosophy change, probably…I mean, if there’s a person whoneeds social services and I’m kicking them out, does that seem really super fair?For Denise, safety for her patrons meant physical safety, as well as the safety embedded in theprovision of appropriate resources, such as mental health services.  Safety for herself and herstaff meant a library space that was without daily conflict or the fear of coping with issues withwhich they have had no training, such as untreated mental illness. As she said:The mental illness is really taxing on our staff…If there were like, a resource, like I keepwanting them to give us somebody like Sofia [social worker at Main]…with maybe thefive branches where there’s a lot of mental illness one day a week visiting, even if we haddrop-in hours where a social services person could kind of network with people.138Overall, Denise did not feel safe enough nor did she think her patrons or her staff feltsafe. The lack of cultural competence training for her staff left her feeling vulnerable andineffective. While we were talking, she took notes to remind herself of ideas that came up duringthe interview. She was eager to find ways to for her Library feel to feel safer for everyone, butthe staffing shortages, the lack of institutional support and the daily pressures of maintaining theLibrary service served as barriers to her goal.Another place where it was forbidden to sleep was in doorways of buildings, such as theMain. In an effort to make the City Library feel safe to some patrons as they entered, thefollowing sign was taped at both of the entrances:NO TRESPASSING!Request for enforcement of municipal police code section 25Signature of owner or agentSgt. Calvin Chou #123Expires 6 months after date 7-1-2011 [since it was after 1-1-2012, it was expired]This particular document was also posted in the windows of the stores, restaurants andpublic buildings that lined the streets of The Shanty. Like the weaponized architecture, thesesigns served to remind people experiencing homelessness they had to abide by particular rules,such as not sleeping or lying down on the sidewalks or in doorways or window wells. This wasyet again an example of trying to create a safe place for some while creating what feels like anunsafe place to others. It was difficult to imagine a homeless LGBTQ youth feeling welcomed inthe Main if he/she was without a safe place to sleep. “No trespassing” could be a powerful termfor a young person living on the sidewalks.139Another place in the Main where the behavior guidelines were enforced was thebathrooms. When the building was designed, there were bathrooms on the main floor, as well ason upper floors. However, due to concerns about bathroom behaviors not in line with Libraryrules, the bathrooms on the upper floors were closed, except the controlled-access bathrooms inthe children’s area. The doors to the bathrooms on the main floor were always kept open, soanyone who was using the wall mounted mirrors, for instance, was clearly visible from the openarea between the two gendered bathrooms. In addition, there were behavior rules posted in both,with a list of prohibited behaviors, such as bathing, and drug and alcohol use. There was also alist of local free showers. In both bathrooms, the stall doors were extremely small, so the headsand sometimes shoulders of the person were visible. This increased visibility was also aimed atlimiting behavior guideline infractions.The result of this was a bathroom that felt uncomfortable to use. The goal was to create asafe feeling for Library users, but for me, as a domiciled person with access to regular privatebathing facilities and the ability to drink a glass of wine in the evening without anyone passingjudgment, it felt ominous, as if there could be dangerous people lurking around. For those whowere homeless, such as the youth, the signs and stall doors served as yet another reminder thatthey were being watched. It was difficult to imagine anyone feeling safe there.Other ways the librarians tried to create a safe place was through various policies relatedto getting a Library card and using the computers. These policies were introduced to reinforcethe mission of the City Library and provide some sort of accountability for the patrons. For themajority of patrons, this worked and so they were able to check out 50 items total at one time anduse the computer up to one hour per day, by using a permanent card that needed to be renewedevery four years. For those who could not meet the requirement of picture identification (i.d.)140and address verification, there was a restricted card. This card still required a document thatverified the name of the patron, it allowed for one item to be checked out at a time, and it wasonly valid for three months. However, they were still able to use the Library computer for up toone hour per day. For those without either of these Library cards, there were 15-minutecomputers, which could be used over and over again, as long as the user got back into thewaiting line. This was the kind of line described earlier by Denise, as she told her story about thechaos created by this time restriction on the computers. For her, this policy made the Library feelless safe, not more. For those without i.d. or a permanent address, the Library did not feelwelcoming. These patrons were in a constant battle with each other over the limited timeallocated for the computers. In this case, it was not clear that anyone felt safer.There were fines and fees attached to the late return or non-return of library materials.These fines can act as deterrents for those who have less money, and ALA (2010) recommendsin their Policy 61: Library Services to the Poor that one way to reach the policy objectivesdescribed in Chapter One is by “Promoting the removal of all barriers to library and informationservices, particularly fees and overdue charges.” Therefore, this Library - like many across theUnited States - offered an unwritten, unspecified, subjectively applied alternative to fines andfees. This was again part of the struggle as a public-oriented agency: Serving everyone equallyversus serving everyone with compassion. As Laura described it:You know, it’s like I don’t wanna constantly say this in the media or in the publicbecause you don’t wanna give people the impression that we’re not good stewards of thepublic resource, we don’t take it seriously, or that we’re not gonna hold you accountable.But like if a person is in a situation and we have a lot of them here where your backpack141gets stolen, you’re not in a stable housing situation, we try to work with them to makesure that they continue to have access.So another way this Library created a safe place for their Library patrons was byproviding access in difficult times. However, since there was no indication this flexibilityexisted, it was not consistently utilized by those who felt intimidated or embarrassed by theirpoverty. That is, one had to feel safe already to be able to take advantage of these exceptions tothe rules. Because the librarians may not have been aware of this invisible population, they hadset up a system that worked for some but not for others. This was also an example of theunconscious use of power: The librarians could wield their power by either adhering closely tothe rules or by bending them. Either way, the power they held could feel unsafe to the homelessyouth, even though it may have been meant kindly or benevolently.An important aspect of public library service to these young people fell under the largercategory of helping teens feel safe and welcomed in the Library. When fully staffed, the CityLibrary had 11 teen librarians scattered between the Main and the branches. There was atendency to direct questions about teen services to these librarians, and more than once it wasrecommended to me that I do this. This specialty had its advantages: Services to youth ages 12 to19 were taken seriously enough to devote spaces, time, materials and staff to this group.However, the disadvantage to this approach was that regular adult services librarians did notalways feel qualified or equipped to serve them well, as mentioned earlier. This made somelibrarians feel unsafe in their interactions with young people and this could be reflected in theirattitude and their service. Teen librarian Joyce described this:It was funny, I went to a staff, all-staff meeting, recently, and there was just anervousness in people’s voices when they were talking about teen stuff…I don’t know,142maybe I was imagining it, but…many librarians like adult or, um, children’s librariansare just intimidated by teens; they’re afraid of them.  And I think partly that fear kind ofadds to that discrimination, like, “I don’t wanna deal with them.  Just gonna kick ‘em outinstead of talking with them.”  I think they’re not seen as, as people with needs, uniqueneeds.This kind of unease affected not only the librarians, if affected the youth as well. Thelibrarians needed to feel safe serving all populations for themselves but also for their patrons,because if they did not, their reactions and their attitudes varied across service groups. Thisvariation, no matter how subtle, affected their patrons, particularly those who were alreadyhypersensitive to the environment around them. This relates directly to earlier comments aboutattitude, for example the ones by Wen, Hudak and Hwang (2007).When asked how librarians could help homeless LGBTQ youth feel more welcome in theLibrary, Lance answered:Non-judgmental training. They need not to counter-transfer what they’re thinking ontothe person they’re talking to.  If you don’t like the person or you don’t like how theypresent, let that be in your mind, not out in the open, because these kids are very sensitiveto vibrations, and they can feel negativity that quick. And just a slight change insomeone’s facial structure can show that, “Oh…” And you can’t do that.  You have to beopening and accepting.  If you want the diverse community to come to you, you have tomake them feel welcomed.Feeling safe for the librarian could result in a safe feeling for the patrons as well. This isdiscussed more in the section on feeling safe and homeless LGBTQ youth. However, it isimportant to point out that the tension between equal access and the discomfort precipitated by143certain behaviors or appearances was one of the challenges of serving homeless LGBTQ youth,as well as others.Dan also talked about creating what he called a “hate-free zone.” He began by describingthe difficulty in claiming a Library is a safe space, because as he has experienced libraries, theyare not necessarily physically safe:And, and I don’t know if you’ve, are familiar with the argument about libraries as safeplaces, like there’s some people that wanna promote the library as the last beacon of hopefor young people, and then other people that say, “The library should not be promoted asa safe place. There are no safe places left. You shouldn’t tell the teens this is a safeplace,” because I’ve seen some of the crazy stuff, I’ve caught people having sex, founddrugs in the Library, people masturbating in the Library and the children’s room. I meanit’s not safe…That being said, we’re not talking about that kind of safety, we’re talkingabout the, you know, the, um, creating a hate-free space. That’s, might be a better way,like this is a hate-free zone.To Dan, a hate-free zone was created when the Library made it clear that what Joyce called “hatespeech” was not allowed. This concern about hate speech, especially homophobic language, wasshared by many of the librarians as well as the service providers.The service providers, as already mentioned, were particularly focused on helping thesehomeless youth feel safe in their lives. Their goal was to help the youth leave the streetspermanently, so these young people could lead their lives productively and in a safeenvironment. They offered education, job skills and training, case management, housing, mealsand physical as well as mental health care. The approach to all of these services was dominated144by what Abbie called a “youth-focused approach.” When asked about the qualities she looked forin the volunteers, she answered:I think for us what’s most important is that someone comes in non-judgmental, so makingsure that they can either leave biases at the door – I mean, we all have them – but thatthey are in a place where they will not judge young people, they don’t wanna problemsolve for young people, they don’t wanna tell people what to do, or share their ownstories, that they’re really here to come and learn from and listen to and help youngpeople identify their own resources, and then share information about other tools that theyoung person could gain.This kind of training was similar to that suggested by Lance in regard to the librarians. Thistraining was seen as essential to help the staff as well as the youth feel safe in the JYS locations.Also, to create a safe space for these young people, JYS wanted to surround them withadults who respected them and allowed them to “identify their own resources,” as Abbie said. Todo this required the ability to start with where the young person was, using a harm reductionapproach, as explained earlier. This term was a common one in social services, but not in theLibrary. Using harm reduction methods meant not denying services to people, such as thesehomeless youth, because they were using drugs or engaging in any behaviors that may haveseemed uncomfortable to someone else, as long as they were not interfering with anyone else’suse of the Library. This was similar to the equal access in the Library mentioned earlier, but noneof the librarians were familiar with the term itself.Another way of creating safety were the JYS public conduct rules, similar to the Libraryones, designed to make the youth and the staff feel safe. Each location had a slightly differentset, displayed in different ways. At Stop-By, the rules were handwritten with a purple permanent145pen on a large pink sheet of paper that had been created by taping together eight eight-and-a-halfby eleven sheets of paper. It was taped to the wall behind the front desk. The list was titled: Stop-By Rules and Consequences and began with the words: Absolutely No, followed a long list ofitems, such as stealing, offensive or disrespectful actions, threats of violence and sleeping. Thefull list is available in Appendix H.Some of these rules, as at the Library, were enforced more consistently than others. Forexample, one day a staff member spend about 15 minutes, off-and-on, trying to awaken one ofthe young people sleeping soundly on one of the couches. Most days there were youth sleepingon the couches or padded benches. However, that was the only time I saw a staff member try toenforce the no sleeping rule.There were also several comments about stealing - youth warned others not to leave theirbelongings unattended, because they could be stolen. One day I left my jacket on a box of booksfor a minute, while bringing in another box, and was chastised by one of the staff interns (ahomeless youth being paid a stipend as part of a job readiness program). She held up the jacketand demanded:“Is this yours?”“Yes, I just…”“Never leave your stuff - it will disappear.”This attitude toward stealing seemed to be one of acceptance, rather than anger. This is whathappens was the message, so watch your belongings. As Train put it when describing some ofthe rules:146And we oftentimes will reinforce some of these things by just saying, “Hey, you know,there’s a lot of people in here.  Keep your eye on your stuff, ‘cause you don’t know whenit could walk away.”  Um, that’s just a reality within our community…When asked about the rules at PRC, Train answered:We used to have a giant list of rules up on the wall that we actually took down and wedecided to figure out a way to enforce rules without like just listing a bunch of ruleseverywhere.  We came up with this thing up here [indicating a large handwritten posterhigh up on the wall] that says, “Love thy neighbor.  Community Agreements:  Please berespectful and conscious of how your actions impact others.” That’s kind of our go-tostatement for the space.  We want people to be conscious of just how anything they do orsay can affect anyone else in the space…Like if there’s violence, if there’sphysical/verbal threats, these are our like non-negotiables, but they’re stuff that we’revery familiar with, we don’t just have it posted places.  So if we’re dealing withsomebody who’s like maybe escalating to be violent, then we’re gonna address that…It’sa community space for everyone, regardless of whatever.This interactive approach to enforcing rules was also explained by Abbie. When askedabout creating a safe space at JYS, she said:There are rules, just like at every other agency around safety, that are reviewed withyoung people during the intake process.  And so, in terms of just basic safety, there arethings that young people can’t bring in, that they have to check at the front door.  Thereare rules around no threats of violence, no physical violence, and then there are rulesabout not using derogatory language of any kind, and all of that is reviewed and so, if ayoung person is using inflammatory or derogatory language, they would be asked to stop,147and if they continue, it could put their ability to be within the space at risk.  But it wouldmore likely just be a conversation that they would have with staff.This engaged but clear approach to ensuring a safe space fit well with harm reduction andusing community as a focal point. Both the Library and JYS had rules and consequences for ruleinfractions. It was necessary for shared spaces to be controlled in some way so those in the spacecould feel safe. However, it was also important to look at how the rules could impact people. Ifthey appeared to be rigid or uninformed, they created an environment that only felt safe to some.With an average of over 2 million Library visits a year, it was difficult to imagine how the Maincould create behavior guidelines that would support the same feeling of community that wascreated in the much smaller spaces of JYS. However, without that sense of belonging andcommunity, these youth found it difficult to feel welcomed and appreciated when they enteredthe Library.My husband made a comment on feeling safe that gave me greater insight into thischallenge. One day he helped carry boxes of books into Stop-By and later he mentioned howunsafe that environment felt to him. The casual disorder bothered him and the youth sleeping onthe couches made him feel particularly unwelcome. It was the reverse of the Library, where hefelt safe and welcome. He did not need disorder or a place to sleep, so the atmosphere at theLibrary suited him well (personal communication, 2012).Finally, the homeless LGBTQ youth needed a place to feel safe. When asked about theneeds of these youth, Abbie answered:I think the first kind of need is just the safety, and I think that comes in a lot of differentforms, but I think shelter, having a shelter, a place where they aren’t gonna experienceexploitation.  I think for a lot of young people that have run away, if they’re not aware of148shelter services, the risk of them experiencing exploitation on the street is just so highthat simply having a place where they can come in and be away from that is really, reallyimportant.This safety included not only physical safety, but also the emotional safety of being accepted,respected and acknowledged. These young people had left their homes and come to a city thatwas famous for being gay-friendly, because they were ready to be supported for who they were,rather than denigrated; they wanted acceptance, not violence. They were looking for a sense ofcommunity. Even though it could mean living on the streets, they hoped that being allowed to betrue to themselves was the ultimate safety. Unfortunately, even in a city known for its opennessto the LGBT community, life on the streets was extremely challenging. Lance, who was head ofemployment services at JYS, described this well:They thought this was the gay capital, everyone loved them, someone will help them geta job, and everything will be fine. That’s not what happens. They’re there, cute andyoung.  They get taken advantage of, they get used and they get thrown away.  [pause]  “Icame out because I met a boyfriend on the Internet.”  “What happened when you gothere?”  “We had sex for four days and he told me I had to leave.”  I hear those storiesevery day. That’s, that’s real life…Because of these challenges, finding community became a critical part of the lives ofthese young people. On the street, at JYS and at the Library they tried to create connections withother youth like themselves. For example, Talyn placed a high value on spending time withfriends. When asked to describe a good day, Talyn answered:149A really good day? When everything goes right, you know, you get paid, I get a goodamount, I actually can get stuff I really enjoy, hang out with friends…especially hangingout with friends.When Talyn was asked whether s/he and hir friends mentioned the Library much and if so, whatdid they talk about, s/he said:Mostly meeting outside. It’s, makes for a great meeting point, you know it’s there,everybody knows where the Main is. I’ve met up with people in here [the Library], hungout, had fun… Just you know talk, read books, play games…Keep quiet… Having somequiet also kinda contributes a sense of privacy. Just ‘cause you know, I can focus on this,I can do what I need to do, without interruptions from all angles. Being loud, being andlike that. And I think being quiet in libraries like, is kind of, contributes to that and makesit a more pleasant experience. Just ‘cause you’re able to concentrate. Focus…But othertimes it’s just you know, I’m not even coming in here and just hanging out outside.As a homeless transgender youth, Talyn had an appreciation for the quiet space providedby the Library, as well as the opportunity to be in a safe space with friends. Talyn liked theLibrary and liked the “vibe,” despite the reception s/he had the day of the interview. But Talynhad mixed feelings about it, too, as described earlier, so even with that comfort level, Talyn didnot interact with the librarians.Talyn and the other homeless LGBTQ were able to form community through sharedadversity and common goals. One of the youth-initiated JYS programs was a weekly night forthose youth who identified as LGBTQ. This program, which was called “Queer Eves,” was heldat Stop-By. As Abbie described it:150It started as, called like an “Anti-Death Night,” after some of the suicides…[It] was aspace where young people could participate in an open mic, they prepare meals, and foryoung people that aren’t necessarily staying at one of our shelters, that maybe are stayingat an adult shelter, safety where they could shower comfortably was an important one.They also have access to the clothing closet… Yeah, it’s just a space, art space, musicspace, where they can come and feel like part of a community.This sense of community was in evidence at a Queer Eves drag show. The performerslined up at the front and then each took a turn singing along with the music, which was beingoverseen by a young disc jockey. As each young person came forward, they wereenthusiastically received, with clapping and calling out. Watching this, it became clear why thisevent and this place were so important to homeless LGBTQ youth. Outside its walls, the youngman wearing the skintight dress, the bouffant blonde wig, the black sheer stockings and the blackspike heels would probably be at least stared at, if not verbally or physically abused. Here he wassafe to be himself - funny, talented and with the best legs in the place. This room, with its stainedcement floors and muted body smells, was full of energy, exuberance and the right to be safelyoneself.However, there was another side to this. Deborah, who was actively involved in creatingthis one event, also talked about feeling isolated from the other youth. Of all the homelessLGBTQ youth interviewed, she seemed to struggle the most with being alone. When asked aboutthe challenges in her life, her list included: “Another hard part is not having my family [pause]because I feel alone sometimes…If something happens to me, I don’t have any family or anyoneto go to for help.” Deborah’s experiences at Stop-By and even QueerEves frequently made her151feel like an outsider, even though she was the main force behind the drag show. As she put it, theother youth were not friendly to her and “if you try to talk to them, they have a bad attitude.”What is notable about this is that while this may have been related to Deborah herself, itcould also have been connected to her lack of understanding about the lives of her fellow JYSyouth. Like any young people, these homeless youth were still developing social skills, andmany of the skills they needed to survive on the streets did not necessarily translate well intodeveloping respectful relationships. As Cedar expressed it so well when he described hisexperiences at JYS:It’s kind of a cutthroat, slash I wanna help you, community among the youth. You know,if you leave something lay it’s gone. And, you know everybody wants to pretend thatthey’re the biggest baddest roughest kid around. And yet at the same time they’re likeokay well you can go here and can get this, and, so it’s like an odd help you slash hurtyou.When Cedar was asked to say more about this, he answered:It’s just, you know nobody wants to be pushed around, and it kinda comes down to theself-esteem issue where, you know I don’t think anything of myself so I’m going to try tomake you think something of me. Like, “I know people”. Like, I don’t care. Like, dude,at this point if you kill me, at least I’d have heaven to go home to.This aspect of creating relationships showed how challenging it can be for anyone - a homelessLGBTQ youth or a librarian - to gain insight into another person’s life; that is, creating culturalcompetence.Isaiah also mentioned creating community. After describing the death of a close friend,Thomas, he talked about the memorial service held at Stop-By. The room was full of youth,152some of whom did not know Thomas, but they came together in “a giant spiral hug” outside thebuilding. Isaiah described it asKind of recognizing, one, that life is short, but then, also, that we are all in this together ifwe like it or not.  And, you know, that’s so clichéd, but it’s, it’s still very real for us, that,you know, we are strong and we are [pause] we have our own direction.  There is stillthat part where we still do need help, that we can’t do things on our own and that, thatthere are other people, like that, that we can get through this, like we can get through this[pause] but it’s gonna take a lot of people.This statement was moving, because it made it clear that some of these young peoplewere reluctant to ask for help and yet, as Isaiah said, they were going to need it. This mixedmessage played a part in the lack of interactions between the Library and these youth. Even if thelibrarians were willing and able to offer help, they did not know what to offer and how to give it.Abbie was also one of the few service providers who believed strongly in the Library andthe importance of the role it played in the community. She started the interview by saying: “Ilove the Library!” When asked about the connection she saw between the Library and thehomeless LGBTQ youth, she also talked about community. But in this case, she was talkingabout community in a larger sense - the power of the Library to create community amongdisparate people. As she explained:I think that when you come from, potentially, a place where you have less familialconnections, less of that kind of community…finding community in all sorts of waysthrough culture and arts is really important for our young people.  I think it’s where theyfind a lot of healing and growth and …that’s often where people connect is through thatshared love of music or literature or art and that, so, when you’re a young person that153maybe doesn’t have parents or siblings, your friends become your family and so that’show a lot of our young people connect.  And I see that as something that the Libraryprovides for some of our youth.Like the youth, Abbie stressed relationships, but in addition, she emphasized that the CityLibrary offered an opportunity for these young people to feel a part of something larger. Feeling safe for these youth also included being accepted despite their housing status.This was a challenge, because to be homeless in the United States is to be stigmatized, and so ittook courage and self-confidence for them to admit they were homeless. Isaiah described hisstruggle with this:I don’t really see homelessness as something to apologize for.  It’s a circumstance we’reput in, and…there is nothing wrong with being poor, and there’s nothing wrong withbeing homeless, it’s nothing to apologize about, and this isn’t only something that I tellmy friends, it’s something that I have to tell myself, and I have to continue to talk…to tellmyself that at times, when I kind of go through my ebbs.Intellectually, Isaiah knew there was “nothing wrong with being poor,” yet he had to continue toremind himself of this fact, since there were few if any indications in his daily life that povertyand homelessness were socially acceptable.Because of this, some of these young people went to great lengths to hide their housingstatus and this behavior served as a barrier to getting needed services, as well as to feeling like awelcome Library visitor. Cedar’s Library experience in keeping his homeless status a secret isdescribed in Chapter One, when he talked about how having only one set of clothes kept himfrom visiting the Library every day. However, after his careful attendance to his appearance andhis secret homelessness, it turned out that to get a permanent Library card - one that would allow154him to check out more than one item at a time and use the computer for an hour - he would haveto present a signed letter from JYS, effectively revealing himself as homeless. When asked aboutthis, he replied:That, it’ll be like outing myself. So it’ll be interesting to see after that, if anybodychanges the way they look at me. I mean I know it’s something I wanna do because, youknow education is power, and I’ve always said that. And so, I wanna come here and justget a shitload of books and like, dig in. And so I’m excited for that. But it’s difficultbecause it is gonna be outing yourself.The stigma of homelessness held these young people back from asking questions; it madethem tentative and unsure about being in the Library; it made them self-protective and guarded.It was ever-present, unacknowledged and powerful. This was directly related to the stigmaattached to homeless adults who were visibly mentally ill or coping with substance abuse andalso experiencing homelessness. The homeless youth, like the librarians, were intolerant of thisgroup and were careful to distinguish themselves from them. An example of this came fromCedar:It’s just like, you have different types of homelessness. Um, you have the oldergeneration with the Z Z Top beards and that smell like they haven’t bathed in threemonths. And you have the youth that are like trying to make something out of their livesand for some reason you just clump ‘em all together and I’m like no, I am not the same asthis drug, heroin-addicted fifty-year-old man who hasn’t bathed in six months. Like, I, Ihave something, you know I’m not just a faggot without a future.For Cedar to feel safe, he needed to distance himself from what looked like an extremelyunsafe future: Living on the streets, leaned up against cement walls, surrounded by the odor of155urine, with dirt embedded in one’s every pore, waiting en masse to enter the Main each day. Thiswas a frightening future for these young people - they did not identify with these adults and theydid not want to be associated with the common stereotype.This was another aspect that needed to be kept in mind: These were young people, manyof them still teenagers. Their future should have been in easy reach as it was for most domiciledyouth who lived at home at their age or who had ventured onto college campuses across theUnited States. Instead, due to circumstances over which they had no control, they were forcedonto the streets or into temporary shelter, insecure about their futures. Lance explained:We’re, we’re not trying to make anything special.  We’re not saying our population isbetter than anyone else.  We’re just trying to give them an even playing field, so that theyhave the same chance every other young person at twenty-one, who had everyopportunity, gets. That’s all we try to do.To feel safe, these youth also needed adults on their side. One of the most frequentcomments was about the importance of a caring and respectful adult, especially since many ofthese young people had negative experiences with adults in power: Parents, teachers, fosterparents, social workers, government agencies, store owners, even librarians. These youthrepresented a voiceless and powerless minority and it was difficult for them to feel safe without avoice. When an adult reached out and made a connection to homeless LGBTQ youth, thatconnection provided much-needed approval and acknowledgement. This again relates to theinformation about urban teens presented in Chapter Two (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2010;Brehm-Heeger, 2008), as well as to comments made by service provider Sofia when asked whatshe would like librarians to know about these youth:156They’ve really gotten used to being turned away and ignored and I think that needs tochange.  I think it's really important as an adult to recognize them and acknowledgethem… They're young people and they're young people that really seek out adultapproval, even though we don't necessarily see it or know it…They’re used to being onthe streets and asking for change and having people ignore them and ignore them andignore them, or being kicked out of establishments, so I think it's just so important to kindof build this space where like they're not alienated and they're not ignored, and they're notkind of pushed to the sides…You know, ask questions and talk to them, and, yeah, offerthem support in a kind and authentic way…I think that they're afraid that people aregonna judge them a lot, so they just kind of choose to be quiet and ignored.The librarians had little knowledge about the daily challenges faced by these youth. Itwould probably come as a surprise to them that these young people, some of whom may haveseemed frightening or dangerous, needed to be acknowledged by a librarian. They did not thinkof the Library as a place of power and privilege or that it could be intimidating anduncomfortable. When asked about the City Library and these young people, Abbie replied:I think that our young people, probably, especially our PRC young people that tend to fitwithin kind of more of the stereotype of homelessness, get judged so much based on howthey look for going into any sort of environment, that, yes, they probably aren’t ascomfortable going into the Library, because people may think that they’re just going inthere to use the bathroom or, you know, take a book or whatever it may be.In addition, for these homeless youth, feeling safe meant having a place to sleep at nightand a place to be during the day where they were not in danger. Sleeping on the streets could bea frightening experience, but so could sleeping in some of the adult shelters. Cedar and Talyn157both mentioned spending only one night in VTU East, an adult shelter run by a faith-basedorganization, because there were no beds in the emergency TAY shelter. As Cedar described it:So I went up to the Hayes and I was staying there and there were cops on bikes and so Iwas talking to them and, about, you know where can I go, and they told me about VTUEast and VTU East is not somewhere you wanna be…You know, there was a lot of…who’s bigger and badder there. And so I got my phone stolen and I got my phone chargerstolen and I got threatened and I’m just like okay, I’m not coming back. It’s bettersleeping on the street.As described in Chapter Two, it was also dangerous living on the streets. However, thehomeless youth did not talk much about this. There were references to feeling safe at Stop-By orat the Main, but there were not many stories about the risks they encountered on a daily basis.Isaiah, Ari and Talyn did mention friends who had died and Isaiah made a connection to this andto being survivors:And even though people say that we’re victims and that we’re from, we’re this and that,you can’t be a victim and vulnerable and survive on the streets, or be homeless.  Thatthere, there comes a little bit of self-sufficiency, and a little bit of direction that’s of ourown making for us to actually be at this point.  A, a friend recently passed away and Iwas asking, like, “Has anyone actually ever died before within Juniper Youth Servicesthat you guys know of?” and they’re like, “I think like one or two, but…” and this is like,um, I guess, my case manager’s boss, basically, was like, “But by the time you get inJYS, you’re pretty much a survivor,” you know.  I don’t wanna say “natural selection”but whatever has happened in our lives for us to get to this point, like it’s, sadly whittlesdown people.158These youth had learned to use places like the Library as refuges from the dangers of the streets.In this way, the Library provided safety, but usually without the knowledge of the librarians.Another aspect of safety for the youth was the anxiety not only about obeying theobvious rules, but also about possible unwritten ones. When a homeless LGBTQ youth enteredthe Main, s/he felt uneasy. What were the rules? What if one accidentally broke those rules -what would happen? Because the Main represented not only the resources, but also the buildingspace itself, breaking the rules could mean losing a sanctuary, as mentioned in the introduction.Worrying that someone could, as Talyn said,  “throw you outside at any given moment,”precipitated feeling watchful, nervous and unsure of one’s welcome. For the homeless LGBTQyouth, it acted as a reminder they probably did not fit in and they could only hope no one wouldnotice. It lay under the desire to  “pass,” as described earlier, and consequently being unwillingto draw attention to oneself by asking questions that could clarify the rules and expectations.These homeless youth were not able or willing to take the chance of asking for someone to beflexible with the fines or providing services that were not simply about books. When asked aboutbarriers to Library use by these youth, service provider, Sofia put it like this:Like, I couldn't, I couldn't really see them approaching a librarian and saying like \"Hey,\"like just asking questions or needing help, and I don't know why. I think, in general, a lotof times they won't approach the staff at places because they're afraid. They don't want todraw attention to themselves. It's like \"If I draw attention to myself, I’m gonna get kickedout.\" Um, which is a valid fear, because they do. Like I said, they get kicked out all thetime from places.These youth were reluctant to draw attention to themselves, because they were afraid theywould be kicked out for breaking a rule that may not even have existed. This fear prevailed, even159though the rules and the consequences for breaking them were posted in the Main and thebranches. It took self-confidence and self-esteem to question the rules or ask for exceptions, andself-esteem was challenging when one’s nights were spent in a doorway. Cedar expressed it likethis:I just get so frustrated because especially at night when I’m trying to sleep and there arepeople walking by me, I, I just feel so judged, like, they’re looking at me and saying, ohthis kid’s an alcoholic, this kid’s a drug addict, this kid’s a drop-out, this kid’s a loser,this kid’s, you know, whatever… just looking at you like you’re dirt. I used to think a lothigher of myself and now I have a lot of self-esteem issues and I’m like well, I don’twanna get in your way. Well, like, what? That never would’ve been me before, I wasmore assertive and more, self-positive imaged but recently I’m like uhh, I don’t wannaget in your way, don’t look at me…and it sucks.In earlier chapters the resilience of these youth was described. However, the price thatcan be paid for having to be resilient, for having to persevere despite becoming what Lauracalled “street-involved” was a questioning of self that acted as a barrier to services andrelationship. This was particularly true for homeless LGBTQ youth at the Library, because theLibrary carried the weight of the straight middle class. The stereotype of a librarian and theLibrary stood in the way of these young people, who were intimidated - not by learning orknowledge or even books - but by those who controlled the access and the environment in whichthey were found. This control was governed by rules that appeared unyielding and consequentlyuncomfortable. There were not rules against being a homeless LGBTQ youth at the City Library- but it felt that way. They were not sure they were welcome, they were not sure they would not160be asked to leave, they did not understand the flexibility in some rules, and they worried thatonce their housing status was revealed, they would be treated poorly. They did not feel safe.Apple expressed this reluctance at the focus group, when the question of Library use wasintroduced. All five of the youth in the group went to the City Library but none of them checkedout items. Three had overdue fines that were blocking their Library cards and so they only usedthe Library for the 15-minute computers and for reading books on site. When I commented thatthe librarians mentioned they would be flexible with fines and overdue items, Apple talked abouthaving her Library books stolen in one of the shelters and said:Um, I haven’t talked to them [Library staff] about it, yet. I was concerned…I don’t know.So, I, I don’t really know how that works or how I could get it waived, so…I mean Icould [talk to them]. I just, I just, I mean I’m gonna clear it up at some point. I justhaven’t gotten around to it, and I really didn’t see that as a feasible possibility like or…Ididn’t think of the option being there that they might be able to waive it, um, I justfigured I would have to pay it so I didn’t bother.Apple was an assertive, self-assured young woman. Black hair framed her pale face, hereyes were outlined in black, her lips coated with a deep red lipstick and she had several facepiercings, including her eyebrow, her nose and her lip. She led a weekly “healthy eating on thestreets” discussion group at the Stop-By, complete with food samples, and she was not reticent toexpress her opinions. She appeared, like Cedar, to be confident and willing to speak up whennecessary. Yet the Library and its rules intimidated her.This can be contrasted with Stop-By, where the youth were comfortable and relaxed,despite the security upon entering and the long list of posted rules at the front desk. At Drop-Inthey were not hiding their housing status or their sexual orientation or gender identity. They161knew they would be accepted for who they were. At the City Library, they were keeping theiridentities hidden, fearful revealing them would get them kicked out. The Library rules felt likeone more weapon that could be used against them.It is interesting to note that this hidden behavior was not as prevalent at the Lake Branch,where Denise worked. There at least some of the homeless LGBTQ seemed to feel comfortablerevealing their housing status. However, their behavior at that branch did get them kicked out.Since the Lake Branch was located in the Phoenix, where there were a large number of homelessyouth on the streets, it may have been that they felt less defensive about being homeless. Someof them, such as the two homeless LGBTQ youth in the altercation described by Denise, also fellinto the category of what Lance described as having “this huge sense of entitlement becausethey’re LGBTQ, they’re young and live in the City and it’s the gay capital and they should geteverything they want…[they] are out, loud, proud and demand everything.” Either way, whetherquiet about their housing status or loudly demanding, these homeless LGBTQ youth were notgetting their information needs met at the Library.Cultural competence. The sixth and final theoretical concept was cultural competence.Cultural competence is not a term that is commonly applied to public librarianship, although itunderlies much of the diversity work that has been done in information science.  However, it is aphrase frequently seen in healthcare and education, which are also, like librarianship, helpingprofessions. Balcazar, Suarez-Balcazar and Taylor-Ritzler (2009) offered a model for culturalcompetence that can serve as an example for public librarians. As they pointed out:Becoming culturally competent is an intentional endeavor, a journey and a life-longprocess. The development of cultural competence means our willingness to engage in aseries of activities such as examining the institutional biases of traditional practices and162services of the agencies we work for; being open and willing to accept individuals fromother cultures; trying non-traditional interventions or changing standard procedures tobetter address individual needs…(p.1158)The term “culture” itself has a range of definitions. Kroeber and Kluckhorn (1952)offered a frequently quoted definition:Culture consists of patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for behavior acquired andtransmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement of human groups,including their embodiments in artifacts; the essential core of culture consists oftraditional (i.e., historically derived and selected) ideas and especially their attachedvalues; culture systems may, on the one hand be considered as products of action; on theother hand, as conditioning elements of further action. (p.181)Ting-Toomey (1999) described two functions of culture that contribute to anunderstanding of the role of cultural competence. First, “culture serves the group inclusionfunction, satisfying our need for membership and belonging. Culture creates a comfort zone inwhich we experience in-group inclusion and in-group/out-group differences” (p.13). Second,“culture’s intergroup boundary regulation function shapes out in-group and out-group attitudesin dealing with people who are culturally dissimilar” (p.13). Both of these highlighted the reasonfor the lack of communication between the librarians and the other two groups. Each group’sidentity with their own culture made it more difficult for them to reach out to each other and tocreate lasting partnerships.Using this view of culture as a foundation, the sixth theoretical concept has beenidentified as “cultural competence.” The definition of cultural competence has been expanded toinclude those who are not within institutions and who are without power or voice; in this case,163the homeless LGBTQ youth. Analyzing the data, it became clear there was a lack of culturalunderstanding between the librarians and the other two groups - the service providers and thehomeless LGBTQ youth.The librarians did not use the term cultural competence, but it played a role in their work.For example, in the City Library, librarians were expected to be prepared to work with specificpopulations; that is, they were expected to be culturally competent in particular cultures, such asthe culture of seniors, children or teens. Joyce described preparing for her job interview at theCity Library by reading books about teens and getting to know the population she would beserving:It made me really think about, you know, um, teen groups and teen individuals and howto speak with them and how to communicate and, “Their voice is important,” and um,you know, just a lot of things that I might not have really thought about quite in thatway…They’re forming their identity.  And, I know when I was a teen, I was super rougharound the edges and had no idea, but I think they can, they can sometimes be abrasive aand, or, or terribly shy, but I don’t think that people sometimes give them room for that,and recognize where they’re at.  Um, they’re ignored.Before her preparations, Joyce was lacking cultural competence in teen culture, but shemade an effort to address this by educating herself and by thinking about the relationshipbetween her own years as a teenager and the lives of the teen Library patrons. She knew it wasimportant to connect with the teens to do a good job as a teen librarian and she wanted to do agood job.The librarians had little to no information about the service providers or the homelessLGBTQ youth. Their assumptions about the youth were based partly on the stereotype of164homelessness that is so pervasive and partly on their apprehensions about engaging with teens. Inaddition, the teen librarians had knowledge about young adults, but their training andinformation did not relate directly to this unique population, who could be both emotionallyyounger and more mature than the domiciled teens who were being served. Most of the librarianswere interested in serving these young people, but they had no idea how to go about doing that.Several of them asked for suggestions on how they could help.For example, late in my research, the City Library formed a task force to do “initialassessments of community partnerships and the libraries they served” (personal communication,August 31, 2012). One of the goals of this task force was to look at ways the City Library couldbetter serve the Shanty. As a researcher looking at homeless youth in this neighborhood, I wasasked about any insights I could offer. During the conversation, I encouraged the librarian todirectly contact JYS, since this was the population JYS served. A week later an email from astaff member at JYS arrived, asking if I would be willing to answer the questions from the CityLibrary; so this process had come full circle. The questions posed by the City Library to JYSwere extensive and included:• What needs do you think are currently not being met among your service group orthe neighborhood community at large?• How do you think the library might help fill those unmet needs?• Do you have any suggestions regarding specific services or materials that thelibrary might offer either within or away from the building? (personalcommunication, September 10, 2012)This exchange was illuminating and served as an excellent illustration of the lack ofcultural competence on the part of the Library, the Library’s sincere approach to gathering165information, and the resistance on the part of JYS to spending time educating the Library. Likeother agencies that deal with homeless LGBTQ youth, JYS got multiple requests fromresearchers every week. They were too busy to spend the time filling out yet anotherquestionnaire and they had no idea which services the Library would be willing to provide andhow that would help them. This email offered insight into the need for meaningful and ongoingcontact between JYS and the Library.The term cultural competence originally emerged as an in vivo code from one of theservice providers, when Abbie used it to describe one aspect of the JYS volunteer training. Whenasked to explain the term, she replied:We start with just of kind of, first, a consideration of what is culture and how everyonedefines it very differently, and that just because you look a certain way or come from acertain background, or your parents identified in one way, that that doesn’t necessarilyequal that that’s how our young people identify.   And, also, just taking into considerationthat youth culture is really important, homeless culture can be very important for ouryoung people, but may not be.  And that our, the youth that we work with haveexperienced, likely, a lot of discrimination potentially from the police, from, you know,going into a store or walking down the street, if they’re sitting on a street corner, from alldifferent types of people because of how they look, because of being young, because ofbeing, you know, looking homeless or being homeless.  And so that they may come to thedoor feeling like they’ve been persecuted so much that breaking down those barriers canbe really hard.  And just being aware that it can take young people potentially a very longtime to feel safe within a system, and feel safe with new adults or new strangers of anykind.  And, so, that’s just a big part of it is just kind of awareness- raising.  Having people166think about kind of their own culture and, and ethnocentricity, that we always think that,you know, we’re right, within that, and just being able to try to come to this space.  And“try” I think is really important, ‘cause it is just constantly something that you’re workingtowards.  Try to come into this space and continue to learn from young people…Nevermake assumptions.As Abbie pointed out, new relationships and situations were difficult for these youngpeople. For the volunteers to be effective, they needed to understand the culture of homelessLGBTQ youth, engaging in what Abbie called “awareness-raising.” This awareness-raising orculture competence was essential if the volunteers were going to be able to engage with theyouth, allowing the volunteers to provide support, meals, services and conversations. Thisvolunteer training was only the beginning, because frequent contact with the youth in their dailylives would enhance the volunteers’ ability to develop relationships with the youth that felt safe.The service providers were also ignorant about the Library. Their assumptions werebased on their own experiences, the stories they heard from the youth and the commonstereotypes about the librarians and the Library. Consequently, all but one of them had eitherneutral or negative attitudes toward the Library and its usefulness for the homeless LGBTQyouth. They were surprised to hear the Library could be interested in actively serving theseyoung people, they were unsure what that would mean, and they were concerned about theyouths’ emotional safety should they use the Library. However, they were also open to thepossibility that the Library could turn out to be - unexpectedly - a good connection for the youthand for JYS.The youth, too, had a lack of cultural competence about the Library - how it worked,what it had to offer them, the mission, goals, rules and attitudes. Consequently the youth were167guessing, basing their assumptions on past or recent experiences and the stereotype of theLibrary and the librarians. Although on the whole the youth felt physically safe in the Library,they felt emotionally unsafe, because they lacked an understanding of the Library and they wereunsure of their welcome. They, like the service providers, were willing to be more engaged withthe librarians, if they could feel safe doing that.Without an understanding of each other, it was challenging for these groups to worktogether. A lack of cultural competence served as a barrier to exploring partnerships and the lackof partnerships served as a barrier to cultural competence. As Train explained:I think that partnerships could be useful especially if we’re trying to figure out how tobuild competency in people who are working closely with our kids, or who are workingperipherally with our kids…but, I mean any person that somebody comes in contact withcan have a lifelong impact on someone, so building competence in as many people aspossible in working with our population is always a great idea.Train saw partnerships, leading to cultural competence, as a way for adults, like librarians, tohave a positive impact on the lives of the homeless LGBTQ youth. This is what s/he wanted forthese youth: More respectful and knowledgeable adults in their lives.Selective coding: Core categories. Once these six theoretical concepts were created, thenext step was to look for core categories that would bring these concepts together, doing whatOktay (2012) described as “identifying a core category or categories and then relating the otherimportant categories to this core category” (p.81). The possibility of using these six theoreticalconcepts as core categories was considered, since they were all supported by the data and seemedto be telling a story about the connection between the City Library, the service providers and the168LGBTQ homeless youth. But although I knew these six concepts could serve as planks for thetheory, I was looking for a way to pull them together in a cohesive way.As I returned to the data and the original 16 broad categories, I asked myself: What isbeing said? What does it mean? How is it applicable to everyone? The image I had at this pointwas of writing down all my categories on a sheet of paper and shaking it really hard to see whatwould stick. I wanted the sticky bits. I wanted the moral of the story.As I thought and worried and reread and thought some more, two core categoriesemerged from the stories I heard and the theoretical concepts I already had: Creating safety anddeveloping cultural competence. Table 3 shows the emergence of these core categories.Table 3.

Absolutely not. A groundedtheorist makes choices like any other researcher” (Stern, 2009, p.61).Emergence of theory.There was much that emerged from the data in this case study. However, the mostconsistent stories centered on the two core categories of creating safety and developing culturalcompetence. All of the groups tried to create safety for themselves or for others. The librariansused numerous behavior guidelines, policies and attitudes to try to attain this safety, and many ofthese rules were in reaction to the visibly homeless adults who used the Library on a daily basis.The service providers were particularly concerned with the safety of the youth - and overall theywere convinced the youth would not be safe in the Library, because they would not be treatedrespectfully or fairly. The youth wanted to feel safe in the Library and they were able to achievephysical safety, by using the Library space as a sanctuary, but not emotional safety, because theirlack of knowledge about the Library and the librarians’ ignorance about them made them feelanxious and insecure. They did not feel welcome there and the rules and policies contributed tothis discomfort.Cultural competence played a part in this story because it was a lack of culturalcompetence that made it difficult for the librarians to be able to engage with the homeless youthand the service providers. The librarians were willing to learn more about serving thispopulation, but they were stymied by the lack of time, institutional support, and information.They were also nervous about what serving homeless LGBTQ youth could entail - their lack ofknowledge made them uncomfortable. However, they were willing to work with the service170providers. It is important to emphasize this willingness on their part and the expectation that theydid a have role in serving these youth.On the other hand, neither the homeless youth nor the service providers expected the CityLibrary to play such a role. Their lack of cultural competence about the City Library, theirexperiences, and the stereotype of the librarians served as significant barriers to creatingmeaningful and positive relationships with the library. The homeless youth had no expectationsabout being seen and acknowledged by the librarians, but would have been happy to have thathappen. The service providers did not reach out to the librarians, but were willing to beapproached.There were little to no interactions between the librarians and the other two groupsbecause the lack of cultural competence served as a barrier to the fostering of positive andproductive relationships. The service providers and the homeless LGBTQ youth wanted to orwere willing to know more about the Library, but they did not know how to do that or they didnot feel safe doing that. For each group there was a different reason, but the overall result wasthe same: A lack of cultural competence created a rift between the librarians and the other twogroups and this rift meant that the homeless LGBTQ youth were not able to feel safe enough inthe Library to take full advantage of the myriad resources that could have been available to them.Thus, the Library played a limited role in the lives of these youth.The following table illustrates the intersection of the core categories and the theoreticalconcepts.171Table 4. The grounded theory and its componentsTheory In order for the Library to be able to provide relevant materials and servicesto the homeless LGBTQ youth, it is necessary for the Library to be perceivedas an emotionally safe and welcoming space by both the youth and theservice providers. In addition, the librarians need to feel both physically andemotionally safe in providing this space. To create this safety requiresshared cultural competence between the Library and the other two groups.Core categories Creating safetyDeveloping cultural competenceIncorporatedtheoreticalconcepts1.

In addition, the librarians need to feel both physically and emotionally safe inproviding this space. To create this safety requires shared cultural competence between theLibrary and the other two groups. This theory was derived from the two core categories:Creating safety and developing cultural competence, which in turn emerged from the sixtheoretical concepts: Time, attitude, welcoming, building relationships, feeling safe and culturalcompetence. These eight - the core categories and the theoretical concepts - provided theunderpinnings for this theoretical scheme.173Chapter FiveDiscussion, Implications, Conclusion “In open and accessible public spaces and forums, one should expect to encounter and hear fromthose who are different, whose social perspectives, experience and affiliations are different.”(Young, 1990, p.55)This chapter begins with a review of the findings, followed by a discussion that relatesthe core categories of creating safety and developing cultural competence to larger societalissues, including public space, cultural alterity, the role of impartiality, and attitudes towardhomelessness. The six theoretical concepts of time, attitude, welcoming, building relationshipsand feeling safe are incorporated into this discussion as well. The implications and significanceof this case study are also offered, as well as thoughts on the limitations and on future relatedresearch. The chapter ends with some personal observations about this topic.Summary of findingsThis was a case study of a public library in a city that was home to more than 5000homeless youth, of which about 2000 could be identified as LGBTQ. This case study startedwith the question: What is the role of the public library in the lives of homeless LGBTQ youth?It grew to incorporate other questions that emerged along the way, such as what is safety? Whatis a library? What does it mean to be homeless? These questions and more were answered bybringing together the voices of the librarians, the youth and the service providers, as well as otherdata such as observations and materials from both organizations. Out of this data came the sixtheoretical concepts of time, attitude, welcoming, building relationships, cultural competence andfeeling safe, and the two core categories, creating safety and developing cultural competence.The theoretical scheme (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.56) that emerged from these eight was, as174described in Chapter Four: In order for the Library to be able to provide relevant materials andservices to the homeless LGBTQ youth, it is necessary for the Library to be perceived as anemotionally safe and welcoming space by both the youth and the service providers. In addition,the librarians need to feel both physically and emotionally safe in providing this space. To createthis safety requires shared cultural competence between the Library and the other two groups.DiscussionAt the beginning of this case study, I knew little about what each of the three groupswould say regarding the Library and its interactions with these young people. It was apparentearly on that the youth used the Library but either did not engage with Library staff or interactedminimally. Many of the service providers had either negative or neutral attitudes toward libraries- they expected nothing from them that would help the youth they worked with daily. Thelibrarians were what one librarian called “time-pressed” (Joyce, 2012), although they sincerelywanted to help. Overall, there seemed to be different interpretations of basic ideas, particularlywhat it meant to feel safe and to be welcomed. Over and over there were the same words, butwith different meanings and dissimilar intent.Each participant’s interpretations of these terms were compared to each other. Based onconcepts that emerged from the data, such as safety and welcoming, these questions were posed:How does each group define these concepts? In what ways do they agree with each other? Inwhat ways do they disagree? How do these agreements and disagreements inform the question?Creating Safety. To reiterate the definition: Creating safety means insuring a personfeels both physically and emotionally safe in an environment, such as the public library. In thisresearch, it was found that the homeless LGBTQ youth used the Library as a physically safespace off the streets. They had no expectation it would be more than that, and in general, they175maintained invisibility as much as possible, since their expectations of the Library’s ability toaddress their particular needs were so low. They did not feel welcomed and they hoped only tobe left alone and not be kicked out.On the streets, in the shelters and in public spaces, such as the Library, the youth alsomaintained what Mallon (1998) called “hyper-vigilance, i.e., the constant scanning of theenvironment for negative signals” (p.27). This vigilance helped them feel safer, and it also madethem aware of the attitudes of the Library staff, the enforcement of conduct policies, such as nosleeping rules, and the presence of LGBTQ-affirming indicators, such as rainbow flag stickersand LGBTQ book collections.The City Library, where these youth spent time, had created public conduct rules thatwere largely in direct response to the visibly homeless adults who frequented the Library daily.The librarians felt unsafe without these guidelines and thought the majority of the their patronswere also uncomfortable. However, the guidelines and the attitudes that accompanied them madethe homeless LGBTQ youth feel unsafe and unwelcome. The rules created an atmosphere ofsubtle intimidation for those Library patrons who were unable to comply with them and who feltpowerless to object.The librarians considered these guidelines necessary and impartial. “We treat everyonethe same” was one of their frequent refrains. Young (1990) described this “ideal of impartiality”beautifully:It serves at least two ideological functions…First, claims to impartiality feed culturalimperialism by allowing the particular experience and perspective of privileged groups toparade as universal. Second, the conviction that bureaucrats and experts can exercise theirdecisionmaking power in an impartial manner legitimates authoritarian hierarchy.”(p.10).176This power dynamic existed in the Library. The rules, although applied to everyone,affected each group in a different way. This point was made in Chapter One, in the findings fromthe Community-Led Libraries Toolkit (2008), which came out of the “Working TogetherProject.” They, too, found that “same or consistent customer service...results in inequitableservices that further disadvantage socially disadvantaged people” (p.8).One of the challenges in a public space, like the City Library, is making it safe for allwho inhabit it, both the employees and the visitors. The choices that are made in how to do thiscan reflect the norms of society and the hegemony that controls those norms. As Laurenson andCollins (2007) said: “At least implicitly, the ‘public’ whose safety is to be improved isunderstood in narrow and exclusive terms, encompassing only those engaged in legitimate actsof production or consumption” (p.651). Because of this attitude, the decisions made about whowas welcomed frequently determined who was not welcomed. Feeling welcomed and feelingsafe are closely tied - a space that feels welcoming is a space that feels safe.An interesting aspect of this is that when asked what they wanted the librarians to knowabout them, several of the youth also referred to the idea of “everyone.” Talyn answered: “Weare the same as anyone else.” Deborah said:  “They should treat us normal like everyone else;”and Isaiah replied: “Just see us as any other person.” The contrast of the desire to be treated “likeanyone else” but at the same time not being anyone else presented an important dichotomy. Atthe simplest level, it appeared they agreed with the presumed democratic approach of applyingthe same public space rules and policies to everyone - rules and policies that were not always totheir advantage.But when questioned further about this, the youth made it clear they meant they wantedto be treated with respect and not be socially excluded or dismissed because of their housing177status, their youth, their sexual orientation or gender identity. In other words, they wanted whateveryone else wants: To be recognized and supported for being themselves. They wanted to beapproached with a positive and supportive attitude. This fit well with Abbie’s comments whenasked what she would like the librarians to know about the homeless LGBTQ youth:I would say curiosity is really important because that’s how we’re gonna get to knowthese young people and build trust is to, is for them to not think that we’re just all out toget them, but that we’re actually out there, curious about their lives, and what’s happenedwith them and what things they’ve seen and, um, what perspectives on the world theyhave that can enhance our own, you know?  And, there’s a lot of wisdom that we canattain through just being curious, you know?Abbie’s comments reinforced one of the six theoretical concepts, building relationships.This concept was applicable at all levels: Librarian to homeless youth, youth to youth, youth toservice provider, service provider to service provider and librarian to service provider. Thelibrarians in particular needed to reach out and create meaningful connections if they were goingto be able to serve this population.One of the largest barriers to creating these relationships was a lack of the appropriatecultural competence. This second core category is addressed in the following section.Developing Cultural Competence. Cultural competence includes “being open andwilling to accept individuals from other cultures” through self-examination, training andapplying different approaches to interactions  (Balcazar, Suarez-Balcazar and Taylor-Ritzler,2009, p.1158). The lack of cultural competence affected the youth and the service providers intheir interactions with the Library and the Library in its interactions with them. There weremultiple reasons for this lack, including stereotyping, attitude, exposure and time.178Stereotyping in particular played a significant role. The librarians were exposed daily to acore population of visibly homeless adults and so their impression of homelessness was greatlyaffected by this group. In addition, they had the typical societal attitudes toward homelessness,based on media coverage and parental influences. For example, when asked where he got hisideas about homelessness, Dan answered:Well, I just had a flashback to grade school, learning about, uh, bums on the street, andhaving that be like, “Do you wanna end up like that bum there on the street?” That wasan example my dad used all the time, like “If you don’t do x, y and z, get good grades,and read, go to the right college, you’re gonna end up like that.However, in line with the concept of developing cultural competence, Dan later altered hisviews, based on his direct experiences with people experiencing homelessness:I met a lot of street people, hung out in the City, and realized, “Wait.  These are justpeople without homes. They’re, you know, black, they’re white. Some of them used tohave money. Some of ‘em are gay.  Some of ‘em are…  They’re just like every otherslice of society.  They just don’t have homes.  And some of them stink, but not all ofthem do.Dan’s willingness to change his mind is a critical aspect of developing culturalcompetence. As has been pointed out, cultural competence is a gradual and ongoing process thatis never complete, because cultures are complex. Multiple researchers have argued that increasedexposure to people experiencing homelessness reduces negative attitudes, by increasingknowledge or cultural competence. For example, Knecht and Martinez (2009) reported that aftervolunteering at a resource fair for homeless adults, “exposure strongly influenced respondents’perceptions of the homeless as individuals. After the event, for example, respondents were far179less likely to view the homeless as substance abusers, mentally ill, or dangerous” (p.522). It isnecessary to point out the difference between positive contact, as with these volunteers, and thekind of minimal interactions between the librarians and both the adult visibly homeless Librarypatrons and the homeless youth. These minimal interactions, like the youth’s experiences withthe librarians, served in no way as positive contact or cultural competence aids. If anything, theyexacerbated existing stereotypes.The other stereotype that interfered with building relationships was the stereotype oflibraries and librarians. This was a powerful stereotype and it carried both positive and negativecharacteristics. As mentioned earlier, the homeless LGBTQ youth had an attitude that borderedon reverence toward individuals librarians as representatives of an institution they, like manyAmericans, held in high esteem. However, they were also uncomfortable and anxious whendealing with the Library and the librarians, worried they would be found unacceptable in someway and therefore not allowed to participate. This was created in part by the rules and theatmosphere at the Library, but it also represented a lack of knowledge about the Library and howit worked. Their experiences with institutions and adults had frequently been negative, especiallyregarding their minority status as LGBTQ. It was no wonder they were reluctant to engage withthe librarians. They were intimidated and needed to see indications they were welcomed and safein the Library space, and this would in turn help them develop cultural competence.It should be noted that none of the librarians appeared to be homophobic or in any wayreluctant to serve youth who identified as LGBTQ. In fact, three of the four teen librarians, oneof the adult librarians and one of the Library social workers all volunteered the information thatthey themselves identified as LGBTQ. Alexandra made a point of mentioning that many of theLibrary staff so identified and she thought it was important for the youth to know this. When180asked what she would like the homeless LGBTQ youth to know about the City Library, shereplied:I would want them to know we have queer staff members, you know, like that’s reallyimportant, too.  Um [pause] and that, you know, that’s not something that’s gonna be,you know, like, “Oh, I’m a,” you know, “gay librarian,” but at the same time, I think it’sgood for them to know.This fact could have played a role in helping the youth feel safer in the City Library, lesslike an “other” if they had known, since they had become homeless due to their sexualorientation or gender identity. However, without active engagement between the librarians andthe homeless LGBTQ youth, it was difficult for the youth to know this.Another aspect of cultural competence for the homeless LGBTQ youth and the librarianswas the definition and use of the term “teen.” Although a large percentage of the youth served byJYS were literally teenagers, they did not consider themselves teens. Isaiah explained histhoughts on why he did not use the teen section:I can say part of the reason was just because like the things that they put in the teensection, I kind of thought were like really just paternalistic and stereotypical.  You thinklike these are the books that I want to read? like Sabrina the Teenage Witch and like, like,basically, like book versions of T.V. shows and other things like that…I think that’s greatand all for people who are interested in that, but…I’m not.Isaiah recommended using the term “young adult” instead, because he thought that wouldattract more of the homeless youth. This adjustment in a simple term relates back to earlierobservations about the power being allowed to name oneself. In this case, these youth needed a181term they felt represented who they really were and they emphatically did not identify asteenagers in the common use of that word.The question of the difference between a teen and young adult is one that has beenclosely examined by policy makers and service providers. Furstenberg, Kennedy, McLoyd,Rumbaut & Settersten (2004) discussed the changes in the definition and milestones foradulthood. They pointed out that it “takes much longer to make the transition to adulthood than itdid decades ago” (p.37). The difference between the needs for teens and those who identify asadults was one the City Library had yet to address. What was particularly relevant to thehomeless LGBTQ youth in this case study was that these authors found that:More than any time in recent history, parents are being called on to provide financialassistance (either college tuition, living expenses or other assistance) to their young adultchildren. Robert Schoeni and Karen Ross conservatively estimate that nearly one quarterof the entire cost of raising children is incurred after they reach 17. Nearly two-thirds ofyoung adults in their early twenties receive economic support from parents. (p.38)Since these youth were not living at home or being supported by their parents, this factgreatly impacted their lives. So the resources they needed from the Library were myriad, becausethey were in many ways emotionally younger than their age, but their economic needs weremuch more in alignment with the adult resources. To serve them well, the librarians needed toknow this.Time is an aspect of cultural competence for two reasons in particular. As discussed inChapter Four, the librarians and the service providers had little time to give to creatingrelationships with each other or to gaining mutual cultural competence. When one of the182librarians, Joyce, was asked what she would like the homeless LGBTQ youth to know about theLibrary, she replied:I might say, “Look, we’re so busy and we’re so frantic and we’re trying to just keep up,and we haven’t forgotten about you, but we haven’t had the time to really think aboutwhat we can do to help you.  Help us help you.  What’d you want?”Her words represent well the dilemma for the librarians: They wanted to help these youngpeople, they did not know how to do that and they did not have time to find out. In addition,because these librarians had little cultural knowledge about the youth, they were concernedhelping them might take time away from their other duties.The homeless youth, on the other hand, tended to have ample time, which was spentwaiting for services, shelter, interviews, job training, friends or meals. One of the functions ofthe Library in their life was as a place to safely spend this time. Because of the nature of the waytheir time was spent, the youth were also unpredictable. Their lives could be chaotic and socreating programs for them would require not only valuable time, but also a personal connectionand cultural understanding. Even then, they might not show up. When asked if he hadsuggestions for the Library, Isaiah described this issue well:I’m in this demographic, love it to death, but …there can be money and there can bespace provided for these, for youths like me.  It’s just a matter of if we will come, andeven if we say we’ll come, if we’ll actually come.  And you may have something that onpaper would be the most perfect thing and very well may be…however…things come up,and the priorities change, and even though you may want to find out what’s going on atthat, you know, Library kind of program that’s happening, like maybe I’m gonna have tofigure out how to make ten dollars to eat, or gonna have to like figure out like how’m I183gonna walk across town, you know, by the time, uh, the shelter beds open up at JYS, orsomething like that.  So it’s really hard for me to kind of say what would work and whatwouldn’t work.By gaining cultural competence in each other’s lives, the librarians and the youth couldwork together to create programs or resources that would be valuable to the youth. They couldalso address barriers the youth might encounter in using the Library as a resource.This kind of connection has already been created in public libraries, with what arecommonly called TAGs or similar names. These are usually comprised of a core group ofteenagers who advise the teen librarian on issues of collection development or programming. Theinclusion of homeless teens could benefit everyone, but again, the use of the word “teen” mightserve as a barrier to recruitment of these youth.Isaiah made one more excellent point about this. When I asked how he finds out aboutevents or programs, he recommended working directly with homeless youth organizations, inparticular JYS, to get the word out. To be able to do this, the Library and these serviceorganizations would have to have a much deeper understanding of each other, by taking the timeto meet together and be part of each other’s essential networks.Critical theory. In some ways, my findings mirror the basic assumptions of criticaltheory presented by Kincheloe and McClaren (2005):That all thought is fundamentally mediated by power relations that are social andhistorically constituted; that facts can never be isolated from the domain of values orremoved from some form of ideological inscription; that the relationship between conceptand object and between signifier and signified is never stable or fixed and is oftenmediated by the social relations of capitalist production and consumption; that language184is central to the formation of subjectivity (conscious and unconscious awareness); thatcertain groups in any society and particular societies are privileged over others and,although the reasons for this privileging may vary widely, the oppression thatcharacterizes contemporary societies is most forcefully reproduced when subordinatesaccept their social status as natural, necessary, or inevitable. (Kincheloe & Steinberg,1997, as quoted in Kincheloe & McClaren, 2005, p.304)Much of what they described related well to this research population. LGBTQ youthhomelessness is a result of inequities in society, perpetuated by stereotypes, bigotry, ignoranceand a lack of understanding of the power struggles that exist in shared public spaces, such aspublic libraries. The presence of a power dynamic had great influence on the interactions oflibrarians and homeless LGBTQ youth. What was fascinating about this was there was noapparent intention. That was the irony of looking at a group of people who were dedicated toserving their communities. Their power came from their very position in relation to these youngpeople; however, it was not power they chose or even understood. The imbalance in power waswell illustrated by the different interpretations each of these groups had of the concept of“feeling safe.”  They were frequently at odds with each other, through no fault of anyone. Thefault lay instead with society and the ways in which serving those who are experiencing povertyand homelessness and treated as others are approached.However, although the homeless youth were affected by these power dynamics, they alsoresisted them. For example, one of the outstanding characteristics of these youth was the abilityto create a new set of rules or even to invent a lack of rules - allowing for the freedom to createand re-create oneself, using constantly evolving language, behaviors and expectations. Thisability contradicted the assertion they accepted their social status, described above by Kincheloe185and McClaren (2005), as “natural, necessary, or inevitable.” On the contrary, the very fact ayoung person identified as genderqueer, for instance, placed hir on the margins of a genderedand heterosexist society, yet the margin itself was a place s/he may have purposely chosen. bellhooks (1990) described this beautifully:I am located in the margin. I make a definite distinction between that marginality whichis opposed by oppressive structures and that marginality one chooses as site of resistance.This site of resistance is continually formed in that segregated culture of opposition thatis our critical response to domination. We come to this space through suffering and pain,through struggle. We know struggle to be that which struggles, delights, and fulfillsdesire. We are transformed individually, collectively as we make radical creative spacewhich affirms and sustains our subjectivity, which gives us a new location from which toarticulate our sense of the world. (p.153)These young people were on the streets because they resisted society’s attempts to defineand name them. They chose resistance over compliance, but it was a challenge. As they struggledto find and use their own voices, they were stigmatized and stymied by their housing status,poverty, lack of education and employment, and their drive to have control over their ownidentities. Their discomfort in the Library and limited interactions with the librarians was areflection of this marginalization, even as they chose to be outside the established norms. Thisdual reality was confusing for the librarians and contributed to the lack of understanding betweenthe two groups.186Cultural alterity. The concept of cultural alterity also provided insight into the researchquestion. The librarians represented the Library culture, as well as their own domiciled andmiddle class culture. Schutte (1998) wrote about cultural alterity and her thoughts on why it wasso difficult to address issues of “otherness.” As she observed:One sees how difficult it is for groups that are deeply entrenched in their own values, andthat have the power to ignore the values of other groups, to attain any adequateunderstanding of cultural alterity. The reason for this is that people of different culturesdo not speak the same (cultural) language and do not share the same cultural imaginaryorder…The speaker from the dominant culture is basically saying: communicate with meentirely on the terms I expect; beyond this, I am not interested. The ethical principle ofcultural alterity must point to the inadequacy of such a speaker to engage in cross-culturalas well as interpersonal dialogue and conversation. Yet by the conventional norms of hisown culture, the dominant speaker may never understand that he is silencing theculturally differentiated other because it never occurred to him to think that cross-culturalcommunication contains important, yet incommensurable, elements. (pp.61-62)This willingness to engage in cross-cultural communication requires a recognition thatdifferent cultures exist in a given situation and that communication may be inhibitedunknowingly. This is a hard lesson for librarians, because they may be unaware of the impact oftheir middle class domiciled library culture on those outside of it, such as those living on thestreets.The premise of a public library is deeply entrenched in the idea, beginning in the mid-1800s, that libraries represent a democratic ideal. As Buschman (2005) so eloquently put it:Libraries help make possible the democratic public sphere ideal in the form of rational187organization of human cultural production and they embody an essential element ofdemocracy: A place where the ideal of unfettered communication and investigationexists in rudimentary form, hosting the turbulent discourse of a democracy and itsculture. (pp. 9-10)In many ways, this continues to be true of libraries. Yet it also continues to be true thatthe “turbulent discourse” in libraries has resulted in behavior guidelines and unwelcomingattitudes toward those, such as people experiencing homelessness, who feel out of place andunsafe in a library.Philosophy. According to Denzin and Lincoln (2000), “All qualitative researchers arephilosophers” and they are guided by principles that combine beliefs aboutOntology (What kind of being is the human being? What is the nature of reality?),epistemology (What is the relationship between the inquirer and the known?), andmethodology (How do we know the world or gain knowledge of it?) (p.22)As evident from the previous descriptions of this research, these principles underlie all ofit. In addition, the philosophical aspect is worth noting, because some of the literature that hasprovided insight into the research participants came from philosophers. The combination of thereality of the participants’ lives with the abstract and yet significant philosophies that examinedstigma, identity, exclusion and marginalization meant this topic functioned in two worlds and itwas an excellent mirror of librarianship itself. The day-to-day interactions in the City Librarywere affected by practical considerations, such as budget, community needs, staff, materialselection and much more. At the same time, the democratic principles of intellectual freedom,equal access and privacy supported and inspired the many services offered. This balance ofphilosophy and practicality is one of the largest challenges to public libraries in general,188especially in times of economic hardships. However, it cannot be overemphasized that bothaspects of librarianship are essential for the well being of the libraries as well as the communitiesthey serve. Implications for Public LibrariansThere are a variety of ways this research impacts public librarians. These ways have beenbroken down into two categories: The role of public libraries in their communities, and somesuggested practical applications of this research.The Role of the Public Library. One of the oft-touted roles of the public library in acommunity is as a “community builder.”  In 2006, ALA began the “Libraries Build Community”project in New Orleans, as an outcome of efforts to address the devastation there wrought byHurricane Katrina (American Library Association, 2012a). This was followed by a new initiativein 2012, “Librarians Build Community,” created by the ALA Emerging Leaders Team(American Library Association, 2012b). Both of these looked at concrete ways libraries andlibrarians could make practical and meaningful contributions to communities. There are many,many more examples of this idea, but the basic idea is that libraries are essential to supportingcommunities. There is also much that has been said about the decline of the public library. Buschman(2003) wrote convincingly about the trends in librarianship toward a corporate, customer-drivenmodel. As he asserted: “The cumulative effect of these decisions has been to dismantle theaspects of the democratic public sphere that have been historically embedded in - and extendedthrough - librarianship” (p.48).How do these two approaches inform this research? Both of them underlie the attitudestowards homelessness, youth and LGBTQ issues. For libraries to build communities and for the189democratic public sphere to be able to continue to be truly democratic, there must be a closeexamination of underserved and frequently stigmatized populations, like LGBTQ homelessyouth. We must ask:  “How is community being defined?” “How welcome are these youth in thedemocratic sphere?”In his concluding chapter, Buschman (2003) recommended a community conversationabout the role of the library in that community, “engaging it in a rational dialogue about what itshould be in light of democratic public purposes, and the need to provide alternatives andalternative spaces in a culture dominated by information capitalism and media image andspectacle” (p.180). It is hoped this research contributed to that conversation. When librarians talkabout who is being served, they must listen to all the voices, by seeking them out, by letting themknow whom the librarians are and what they have to offer; by creating relationships. If the roleof the public library is really to build communities, librarians must know what they are buildingand whom it is for and who is being left out. If they are offering a democratic public sphere, theymust open their doors to everyone. In “Mending Wall (Frost, 1917), Frost offered these lines:“Before I built a wall I’d ask to know/What I was walling in or walling out/And to whom I waslike to give offense.” Public librarians are encouraged to think about whom they are walling outand ask themselves: Is this wall really necessary?The library approach to homelessness has been mixed. From this case study, it can beseen that rules can supersede or even replace purpose. As Kirst-Ashman (2008) said about thisissue for organizations: “Goal displacement occurs when an organization continues to functionbut no longer achieves the goals it’s supposed to. A typical scenario…is when the rules andfollowing those rules become more important than providing services to clients.” (p.132).Librarians must remember the democratic purpose of public libraries: The job of public libraries190is not to enforce rules; it is to serve its community. While guidelines will always be necessary,they should only be peripheral.Power of the written word. This section would not be complete without the mention ofthe power of the written word, to inform, transform, inspire and create community. Throughoutthis research, every time the topic of public libraries was mentioned, the response was relatedonly to reading books. This was informative but frustrating, because I wanted the youth and theservice providers to understand that libraries are much more than books - they are resources andpersonal interactions and community centers and all the other aspects we, as public librarians,provide and promote.But the participants, particularly the youth, really did read. Books really were a way toconnect with them. When asked for book requests, the young people consistently asked forparticular books by title or for specific subject, such as witchcraft, string theory or mysteries“like John Grisham.” There were also intense descriptions of favorite books. For example, whenasked if she had used the Library to get materials to support her coming out process, Ary spentseveral frustrated minutes describing a beloved book, unable to remember the title:And then, there’s one about [sigh]…  Oh, what’s it called?  It’s actually the two Jewishwomen.  You know what I’m talking about?  It’s the, um [pause] it’s called like[pause]… Oh, shit.  It’s about two – one of ‘em is German and one of ‘em is Jewish andthey both like each other, um… Shit.  What’s it called. I have to think of it.  It’s a reallygood book, and it’s cool because it’s a true story and it has pictures and the one gets sentto the concentration camp, but they still write letters to each other, and it’s like a reallygood story, like… And the one is, I think she died, but she, she grew old happily, so…191Shit, what’s it called?  I don’t remember. But, and they even made a movie about it, Ithink, which I haven’t seen. [pause] And that was a good book, though.Other youth also talked about finding books in the Library that supported who they were,and using the Library to find websites that did the same. In addition, these youth, as mentionedearlier, had a wide range of interests and they enjoyed talking about them with me, the librarian.A conversation between a homeless LGBTQ youth and a librarian is more than a conversationabout books - it is a way of showing them respect. Many teen librarians already know this, butfor these youth it was especially important, because there were so few respectful adults in theirlives. This echoes earlier comments about “respecting each other as sources of meaning andvalue” (Moran, 2011).Practical ApplicationsThe following are suggestions, based on this case study. They are only the beginning,because for each library, service provider and homeless LGBTQ youth, the circumstances andpersonalities will be different.Trainings. One of the librarians, Denise, had been involved in training in her previousjob that provided information about transgender issues. This training had a lasting effect on herand she became an advocate for unisex bathrooms at the City Library:One year at our state conference we got like super transgendered. It was great, it was likeeverything was transgendered that year. And I went to all these things and like, found outwe should all have unisex bathrooms. So I’m super into unisex bathrooms.She spent months fighting to have the single person bathroom at her branch labeled “Unisex”instead of “Family Bathroom,” because, as she pointed out, individual patrons were confused192about whether or not they could use it. When it was pointed out that it did say unisex on thebathroom door, she was ecstatic: “Well then I won!”These kinds of in-depth trainings can contribute to an increase in cultural competence forpublic librarians and provide impetus for engaging in partnerships with service organizations.Meetings. As mentioned earlier, service providers regularly attended meetings, toexchange ideas, to create partnerships, to commiserate, to support each other, to apply for funds.As background for this research, several service providers in large urban areas were interviewedand all of them talked about meetings and conferences. When asked if librarians would bewelcome, they consistently said yes - although they were usually surprised librarians would beinterested. Meetings are important because the casual interactions that can occur over coffeebreaks and the increased exposure to each other’s arenas of expertise are not as likely to occur inbrief trainings, memos, emails, flyers, brochures or even presentations. To be fully engaged witheach other, so the youth can benefit from the individual and joint resources and knowledge,requires constant, uninterrupted interactions that are not dependent on individuals or budgets, buthave become institutionalized and welcomed by all.E-lists. E-lists that are connected to the world of LGBTQ homeless youth provide weeklyor monthly newsletters and announcements about special events or memorable occasions. Theseemail reminders offer a way to stay connected to a world that may be far different from the worldof the librarian; they are one way to increase cultural competence. They also provide inspirationon ways of partnering with organizations or becoming part of a larger community of caringadults.193Glossary of terms. One of the easiest ways to gain insight into the lives of homelessLGBTQ youth is to read and understand a list of the terms that apply to their lives. Posting sucha list in the library would provide information, as well as a constant reminder of the existence ofthis population.StrengthsLiterature. There is extensive literature on the topic of homelessness. Topics include:Needs, suggestions for service, attitudes toward those experiencing homelessness, statistics,personal stories and much more (e.g., Clapham, D., 2007; DeVerteuil, G., May, J., & von Mahs,J., 2009;  Hodgetts, D., Radley, A., Chamberlain, K., & Hodgetts, A., 2007). This literature couldprovide interested librarians with a large amount of background information on homelessness inthe United States, but it provides little insight into public libraries and LGBTQ homeless youth.Previous writings on public libraries and homelessness focused primarily on visiblyhomeless adults, who are in many ways different from the youth population studied here (e.g.,Gehner, J., & Freeman, K., 2005; Redfern, B., 2002; Ward, C., 2007; Dokoupil, T., 2008;Lilienthal, S. M., 2011; Hersberger, J.A., 2005). Many of these writing were offered as practicalguides for librarians when engaging with these populations, either to control behavior or toprovide meaningful services. They serve as stopgaps for an issue that has continued to createconsternation and concern in public libraries, particularly in large urban areas.Library literature also addressed serving LGBTQ youth in public libraries. Articles andbooks discussed such topics as collection development, attitudes and using library resources inthe coming out process (e.g., Alexander, L.B., & Miselis, S.D., 2007; Martin, H.J., & Murdock,J.R., 2007; Gough, C., & Greenblatt, E., 2011; Mehra, B., & Braquet, D., 2006). All of these and194more made significant contributions to the examination of public libraries and LGBTQ youth.However, there was little reference to serving those LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness.There are ample resources offered on homeless LGBTQ youth (e.g., Center for AmericanProgress, 2010; Cochran, B.N., Stewart, A.J., Ginzier, J.A., & Cauce, A.M., 2002; Mok, F.,2006). These focused on creating an understanding of the lives of these youth and clearsuggestions for service providers on how to help them leave the streets. The library wasconspicuously absent both in the body of the research and in the resources offered.Available information about the question addressed in this research was scattered amongthese four different categories: Homelessness, homelessness and libraries, LGBTQ youth andlibraries, and homeless LGBTQ youth. However, although these writings served as excellentbackground resources, none of them addressed this research question. This case study fills in thatgap. It brings together these two topics and offers a theoretical scheme that highlights the issuesthat need to be addressed in order for public libraries to play a significant role in the lives ofhomeless LGBTQ youth.Teens in public libraries. There are multiple ways for public librarians who serve teensto gather and exchange information about relevant services and issues. For example, ALA’sYoung Adult Library Services (YALSA) offered an e-list called YA-YAAC (YALSA YoungAdult Advisory Councils). The purpose of this e-list was to offer “information on programming,teen advisory groups, professional development, and just about everything else! Uses:Networking, exchanging ideas, discussing common problems, encouraging youth participation inlibrary activities” (October 15, 2012). As of October 2012 there were 1762 subscribers to thislist. The daily emails included book suggestions, program questions, summer reading game ideasand much more. Many of the queries were focused on reading, but many others were about using195social media, game consoles and technology-related interactions with the youth. In the two yearsof this research, there were no discussions about homeless youth or homeless LGBTQ youth andpublic libraries.This research offers valuable insights that could be utilized by librarians on e-lists such asthis. It can contribute to the conversation and it is hoped spark interest in addressing the needs ofthese particular young people, in the ways they do and do not fit the profile of teens who use thelibrary. For example, although homeless LGBTQ youth enjoy using social media, many of themneed personal interactions to improve their social skills. This insight into the needs of theseyouth would serve as an important counterpoint to the public library’s ever-increasing emphasison technology. It also jibes well with comments from Dan, who pointed out that the urban teenshe served were more interested in Lego programs than social media ones.Human Rights and Social Justice. Tompkins (2011) offered a definition of socialjustice that relates directly to this research and the findings. As he said:Social justice is the process of communicating, inspiring, advocating, organizing andworking with others of similar and diverse organizational affiliations to help all peoplegain respect and participate fully in society in a way that benefits the community as wellas the individual. (p.10).This research aims to bring together these diverse organizations, so homeless LGBTQyouth are able to participate fully in society and so society benefits from this participation. In thisway, it contributes to the ongoing conversation on social justice, human rights and libraries. Thispopulation of young people is not being actively and effectively served by public libraries.Although they may be within the literal walls of the library, they are outside the service walls of196these institutions and it is imperative public libraries take their place alongside city and socialservice agencies as they all address the needs of these youth.LimitationsAs with any research project, there were multiple limitations. The largest limitation ofthis case study was the fact that it took place in one city, with one library and one homelessyouth services agency. Although this was appropriate for a case study, it certainly leaves openthe possibility there may have been different responses in another geographical area or withanother library or another agency. This is one of the limitations of qualitative and groundedtheory research: The data are highly personal and not necessarily generalizable.Next, in keeping with the case study approach, only homeless youth who were in someway connected to JYS were interviewed. This meant the voices of the youth who were gettinglittle to no help dealing with their housing status were not included.Another limitation was my own lack of expertise as an interviewer and researcher. Astime went on, there was improvement, but there were times when I listened to the recordings andcringed at the questions or sighed over lost opportunities. It is hoped the lessons learned here canbe applied to future research.Access and time were also limitations. Gaining access to the librarians and serviceproviders was challenging at times, and once access was granted, available time was limited.Access to the youth was also difficult; it took months to find youth to interview and not all ofthem showed up for the interview appointments. Two of them got frequent text messages duringthe interviews, and this cut into the time and interrupted the flow of the conversation.Because on the whole there were face-to-face interviews, it is possible participants mayhave been affected by my age, gender identity and race. Someone younger, who identified more197obviously as genderqueer, might have gotten different answers to questions and had differentquestions to ask.Finally, there was so much data that not all emerging themes were examined closely. Forexample, several participants expressed disappointment or disapproval about the bureaucracy oftheir organizations. This was initially identified as work issues, but ultimately incorporated intothe larger core category of creating safety. A closer examination of work environment couldproduce more insights into the barriers to library service for these youth. Another example wasthe youth’s attitude toward unfettered computer access in public libraries. This was againincorporated into the broader themes of creating safety and developing cultural competence, butthis could also be an excellent topic for future research.Future researchThere is much more research that could be done in relation to homeless LGBTQ youthand public libraries. Hearing from youth who are not being served by social services - youth onlyliving on the streets - would further inform concerned librarians. This research has led me to anincreased interest in transgender and interviews limited to that specific population might offernew information on serving their needs and providing appropriate resources.In addition, this research has provided some insight into how decisions are made inlibraries about which populations to actively serve. Future research on other underserved andmarginalized populations could contribute to the lessons learned here.There does not appear to be any research that closely examines how domiciled librarypatrons feel about the presence of people who are visibly experiencing homelessness. Suchresearch could offer further insight to librarians on this topic and the pressure to create publicconduct policies.198Many of these youth mentioned using the Internet to gather information about resources,and pursuing how, why and where they access the Internet could offer more insights into theirinformation seeking behaviors and provide additional ways of understanding how to meet theirneeds.Several of these youth were engaged in artistic activities, such as art, writing and music.JYS offered art and writing groups, as did a local organization that provided a place for youth toshowcase their art, through shared activities, support groups, a journal, public readings and more.Concentrating just on the arts and homeless LGBTQ youth would be another way to provide adeeper understanding that could be of use to public librarians.Future research could expand this research to other cities, in other parts of the country.The flavors of this city, this library and this agency uniquely combined to tell the story offeredhere. Further research could highlight other attitudes and further approaches to serving homelessyouth.Finally, the question of how public libraries are serving transitional aged youth is acritical one for the future of teen and adult services. There is a gap that needs to beacknowledged and examined. Homeless LGBTQ youth are one example of this population, butthere are also domiciled youth whose needs may not be met by the current approach to youthservices and the definitions given to terms like “teens” and young adults.” Research into thistopic would serve all young people who fall into this category, including the LGBTQ homelessyouth in this case study.199SummaryThis chapter provided an overview of the research findings, including a discussion of thecore categories and the theoretical scheme that emerged from the data. It also includedimplications for public librarians, the strengths and limitations of the study, and suggestions forfuture research. It concludes with the following final thoughts.Final ThoughtsI came into this research with a belief in the critical role of public libraries for culturesthat do not identify with the dominant one. Yet I had little understanding of the power of theword “culture” and how it permeated the daily interactions in this public library.I also had no insight into the world of homeless youth, particularly homeless LGBTQyouth. In preparation, I read the literature on homelessness in general and on this population. SoI knew the challenges and I understood there were terms routinely applied to them, such as “atrisk,” “suicidal” and “resilient.” But it was not until I saw and heard for myself that I understoodthe lack of vocabulary to accurately reflect the lives of these amazing people. I have beenfortunate to have their words to offer, because I cannot imagine how I could claim to speak forthem.Until this research, I had never really interacted with youth workers, like these serviceproviders, and their eloquence and passion inspired me to do my best on this case study, so Icould play a role even a fraction as important as theirs. These are people who care deeply abouttheir work and it was an honor to sit with them, asking them questions and recording their words.Again, being able to use their own language allowed me to weave their stories into the fabric ofthis tale.200Finally, the librarians: I was most aware of their commitment to their work and theirwillingness to add to their already much too busy days by talking to me and taking my questionsto heart. Although I worked as a public librarian for 20 years, I have spent the last four basicallyout of touch with the daily pressures and decisions that create the life of a librarian. Nothing issimple, nothing is easy, and the goal is at once lofty and practical. The daily job of theselibrarians was consistently unpredictable and yet every day there they were again, answeringquestions, providing resources, and drawing on their own beliefs about libraries as they tried toenforce rules such as the one mentioned by Peter: “No willful spitting.” Given all of that, theywere still open to serving these youth, interested in how to do that and constrained not by a lackof enthusiasm, but by a lack of time and institutional direction.As I stand back and look at this case study, most of all I am aware of how much thelibrarians and the other two groups did not know about each other: The librarians did not knowthe youth were afraid of being kicked out of the Library and that their rules and attitudes werefactors in this fear. The librarians did not know they had useful resources for the youth. They didnot that by simply saying hello and learning names they would make a difference in the lives ofthese young people. They did not know the youth and the service providers expected nothingfrom them - had no expectations about what the Library could offer; did not even think it couldor would or even should serve these young people.The service providers did not know what the Library could offer or was willing to offer.They did not understand the basic premise of librarianship - serving all, passing no judgments,wanting to create access. They did not know the librarians were busy and overworked and couldappear rude but it was not meant personally.201The youth did not know they were welcome, that the rules were flexible, that thelibrarians wanted to know how to help but did not have enough time to find out. The youth didnot realize the librarians were not targeting them but were busy and distracted and unprepared.The City Library was not perceived as a safe, welcoming environment by the serviceproviders or the homeless LGBTQ youth. The librarians were interested in changing this, butthey did not know how.I was also informed by the repeated observation that while the Library was a physicalspace, how that space was used and intended to be used was controlled not only by the issues ofspace and power alluded to in Chapter One, but also by some basic assumptions about what theword “library” meant. The largest contrast in meaning was between the Library as resources andthe Library as space. For the librarians, the Library was a place to do library work, whatever thatwork was construed to be. However, to a homeless LGBTQ youth and to those who providedservices to them outside of the Library, it was in addition a building where one could go and sitin relative safety, unmolested by street life. It was a sanctuary - no matter what Library servicesalso existed. At times, there was dissonance between these two perceptions: Library as serviceversus Library as space. This idea was at the heart of my research and the core categories ofcreating safety and developing cultural competence offered insight into it.It is my hope this dissonance can be lessened by prolonged engagement - leading tocultural competence - between the librarians and the other two groups, the homeless LGBTQyouth and the service providers. I believe the Library would benefit, because it not only offers away forward, it also lets librarians know they do not have to be intimidated by the idea ofoffering services to these youth. It will take a commitment of time, of which they have little, butit will be paid back to them in not only the social justice of serving an underserved population,202but also in the contributions that will be made to the Library and to the librarians by becomingpart of a larger community in the City.I passionately believe in public libraries as essential contributors to a better society. Bytaking an active role in the lives of LGBTQ homeless youth, public librarians can yet again showthey really do build community.203List of References204Agar, M.H. (1996).

The terms and definitions included here areprovided as a starting point for discussion and understanding. We must allow others thefreedom to self identify and understand that terms represent different thing for differentpeople, and respect the terms that individuals choose to identify with.” (Sacramento PrideCenter, 2010a)TermsAlly: Someone who confronts heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, heterosexualand gender-straight privilege in themselves and others; and possesses a concern for the well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and Intersex people; and a belief thatheterosexism, homophobia, biphobia and transphobia are social justice issues.Asexuality: A sexual orientation generally characterized by not feeling sexual attraction or adesire for partnered sexuality.

This system221perpetuates and relies on mythical and culturally specific ideals of man and woman, anddisregards any ambiguity or intermingling of gender traits.Biphobia: The fear of, discrimination against, or hatred of bisexuals, which is often times relatedto the current binary standard. Biphobia can be seen within the LGBTQI community, as well asin general society.Bisexual: A person emotionally, physically, and/or sexually attracted to males/men andfemales/women. This attraction does not have to be equally split between genders and there maybe a preference for one gender over others.Cisgender: A gender identity that society considers to match the biological sex assigned at birth.The prefix cis- means on this side of or not across from.

Some change the ordering of the letters and others may use only some ofthe letters. In some situations the A is omitted, such as in research dealing with LGBTIQ issuesonly.Lifestyle: There is no “gay lifestyle” just as there is no heterosexual lifestyle. Lifestyle is definedas a manner of living that reflects the person’s values and attitudes.Oppression: The systematic subjugation of a group of people by another group with access tosocial power, the result of which benefits one group over the other and is maintained by socialbeliefs and practices.Outing: Involuntary disclosure of one‘s sexual orientation, gender identity, or intersex status.Pansexual, Omnisexual: Terms used to describe people who have romantic, sexual, oraffectional desire for people of all genders and sexes.

Stays atemergency shelters are limited in time and the amount of time varies among shelters. Forsome programs, emergency shelters are the first step in a series of steps as homelessadults and youth move from emergency to transitional to permanent housing.Transitional housing: Housing that is more stable than emergency housing and that canbe for a longer period of time, such as 1 to 2 years. Once homeless youth and adults havebeen stabilized in emergency housing, they may move to transitional housing as a nextstep.Supportive housing: Subsidized housing directly tied to specific supportive services forhomeless individuals or families who have come from emergency shelters or the streets.Supportive housing  may be categorized as transitional (people may stay for up to 2years) or permanent (there is no limit on the length of stay and clients abide by a lease).Continuum of care: Organization of service providers established by the Department ofHousing and Urban Development (HUD) to oversee community planning aroundhomelessness. Continua work together to define needs, plan strategies, and prioritizefunding for supportive housing services.226Case management: The process of arranging for the provision of an array of servicesand supports for an individual or family that is based on assessment of their unique needsand designed to address the specific needs identified.Harm reduction: Harm reduction is a non-judgmental philosophy that allows youngpeople and adults to have input into their treatment plans. A harm reduction approachbegins with the person, allowing each person to progress at a comfortable pace.Another category of housing is Single Room Occupancy or SRO. HUD (n.d.) provided thisdefinition:The Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Program provides rental assistance in connectionwith the moderate rehabilitation of residential properties that, when renovations arecompleted, will contain upgraded single occupancy units for individuals who arehomeless. As a result, it is designed to move people into the permanent housing phasewithin the Continuum of Care. The SRO Program assists unaccompanied homelesspersons.It was difficult to find a clear definition of caseworker. However, one site that givesinsight into the actual job description is the City of Phoenix website (2012), which offered thefollowing distinguishing features of a caseworker:• Interviews prospective clients to assess and identify problems and determineeligibility for social services;• Creates and updates manual and/or automated database client files as required tomeet contractual requirements;• Develops and implements casework service plans for moderate to complex cases;• Performs field work relating to the client case plan, such as making home visits227and meeting with other social service providers and businesses in the communityto provide individual client advocacy;• Acts as a liaison between clients, professional staff and community agencies;• Counsels and assists clients in understanding causes and contributing factors totheir problems and persuades them to identify and utilize personal and externalresources to resolve or alleviate those problems;• Provides emergency assistance, crisis intervention and social service referrals• Demonstrates continuous effort to improve operations, decrease turnaround times,streamline work processes, and work cooperatively and jointly to provide qualityseamless customer service.228Appendix C - IRB 1FORM B APPLICATIONTHE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEEApplication for Review of Research Involving Human SubjectsI.

External Funding (if any): N/AII. PROJECT OBJECTIVESThe objective of this research is to gain insight into the attitudes and actions of public librariansas those attitudes and actions relate to services, programs and materials for homeless lesbian,gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) youth. By interviewing both those229public librarians who do and those who don’t specifically reach out to this population, it is hopeda deeper understanding can be reached as to whether or not this is an appropriate role for publiclibrarians, and what barriers may be encountered by those who wish to do so. Interviews withprofessionals who work with homeless LGBTQ youth will help provide background material forthe librarian interviews.III. DESCRIPTION AND SOURCE OF RESEARCH PARTICIPANTSThe primary participants in this research are public librarians. Both public librarians who doreach out to LGBTQ homeless youth and those who don’t will be interviewed. It is expected thatmany of the public librarians who are interviewed will be Teen Services librarians, since thisresearch is particularly focused on homeless youth. All participants will be over age 18. To gainaccess to this population, 3 approaches will be taken. The researcher was a public librarian for 20years and is still connected to the public library world in the San Francisco Bay Area. She willcontact these libraries directly, through email or telephone, and ask if there is anyone in thelibrary who is doing outreach to this population. It is anticipated that it will be much moredifficult to find librarians who are actively serving this population, so the researcher will beginby trying to reach those librarians. The second method will be a snowball technique, followingany leads suggested by these librarians. The third will be emails sent out to public librarian e-lists, asking if anyone is currently serving this population. Examples of the e-lists that will becontacted are:alscpubsch@ala.orgALSC Public Library-School Partnership Disc.

An emphasis will be placed on contactingpublic librarians in large urban areas with a significant homeless youth population, such as SanFrancisco, New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, San Diego, Portland (Oregon) and Seattle. Noincentives will be used.In addition, interviews with professionals who also engage with this population, such as shelterdirectors, researchers and staff at LGBTQ centers, will be conducted when the informationcollected can inform the primary librarian interviews. To gain access to these adults, emails andtelephone calls to the appropriate agencies will be used initially, as well as names obtained fromreading articles and attending conferences and programs that center on this topic. This will befollowed by using the snowball technique once some names are obtained. It is anticipated that20-25 participants will be interviewed.(Please see Appendix I, sample recruitment statements).IV. METHODS AND PROCEDURESWhen at all possible, the researcher will meet with each participant individually for a period ofapproximately one to two hours. During the interview, the researcher will ask open-endedquestions about the participant’s experiences with youth homelessness in general and LGBTQyouth homelessness in particular. The questions will be asked to gain insight into the motivationand reasons for providing or not providing outreach and targeted services to this population, aswell as the perceived barriers to doing so. (Please see Appendix II, sample interview questions).Because of the length of the interview and in an effort to record the participant’s answers asaccurately as possible, with permission from the participant, the interview will be tape-recorded.If no permission is granted, detailed notes will be taken. The tape recorder will be placed on thetable during the interview in plain sight. The researcher will ask orally for consent before turningon the tape recorder and will record the consent itself.If, due to geographic constraints, the researcher is unable to meet with the participant in person, atelephone interview will be conducted. Prior to the conversation, the researcher will email ormail a copy of the informed consent form to be signed by the participant and will ask that it bemailed back. Once the researcher has the signed consent form, a telephone interview willscheduled at a mutually agreed upon time and date. If possible, the researcher will tape recordthe interview and will use the same confidentiality protections as with the face-to-face231interviews. If not, extensive notes will be taken during the interview and no identifiers will beplaced on the notes themselves.The data will be analyzed and interpreted by looking for themes in the answers within eachparticipant’s interview as well as among the interviews. The themes will be interpreted aspossible indicators of common concerns, ideas and thoughts about LGBTQ youth homelessnessand public libraries. Face-to-face interviews will be conducted at a mutually convenient time andlocation. These interviews will take place in private.V. SPECIFIC RISKS AND PROTECTION MEASURESAnonymity is not possible for the participants since the meetings will be face-to-face or since theinterviewer knows the participant’s name. Otherwise, the other greatest potential risk for thisstudy is the risk of breach of confidentiality. To protect the confidentiality of the participants, thetape recordings will be transcribed by one of the co-investigators. If an outside transcriber isused, he or she will sign a confidentiality agreement (Please see Appendix III, transcriberagreement). During transcription, any identifiers will be removed and a pseudonym will bechosen for the interviewee. The co-investigators will be the only ones to have access to thesematerials. The digital recordings will be stored on Julie Winkelstein’s personal password-protected computer and the original recordings on the digital tape recorder will be erased. Therecordings will be transcribed as quickly as possible and only the co-investigators will haveaccess to them. The transcriptions and notes will be kept separately and securely from anyidentifiers. Since this data contributes to the research for Julie Winkelstein’s dissertation, thedigital recordings will be erased from the computer at the completion of the dissertation.VI. BENEFITSThe benefits to the participants will be part of a greater benefit to public librarians who may ormay not reach out to homeless LGBTQ youth. It is hoped this research will inform publiclibrarians as to the needs of this group, as well as the ways this group does use public libraries,and possible barriers that prevent them from doing so.VII. METHODS FOR OBTAINING \"INFORMED CONSENT\" FROM PARTICIPANTSA written consent form will be used to obtain informed consent for participation in the interview.The consent form will be read aloud and the participant will be asked to sign the form to indicatehis or her understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in this research. The consentform will also include a separate signature line to acknowledge the participant’s willingness to betape-recorded. The participant will receive a copy of the consent form. The signed consent formswill be kept in a locked drawer in the main School of Information Sciences office and will bekept separately from the transcriptions and notes. The School of Information Sciences officeaddress is: School of Information Sciences, University of Tennessee, 451 CommunicationsBuilding, 1345 Circle Park Drive, Suite 451, Knoxville TN, 37996-0341.Only the co-investigators will have access to the informed consent forms.

Project Classification: Enter one of the following terms as appropriate: Dissertation,Thesis, Class Project, Research Project, or Other (Please specify)Pilot project and dissertation3.   Title of Project:Social work or social responsibility? Public libraries and homeless LGBTQ youth:Homeless Youth4.   Starting Date:Upon IRB approval5.   Estimated Completion Date:August 1, 20126.   External Funding (if any): N/AII. PROJECT OBJECTIVESThe objective of this research is to gain insight into the daily and life information needs ofhomeless lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) youth, as those235needs relate to public libraries. It is necessary to hear the voices of these youth so their storiescan inform this research, which looks at the role of public libraries in the lives of homelessLGBTQ youth.III. DESCRIPTION AND SOURCE OF RESEARCH PARTICIPANTSThe primary participants in this research are homeless LGBTQ youth. For the purpose of thisresearch and based on the available literature, unaccompanied homeless youth will be defined asyouth ages 12 to 24 with no familial support or permanent residency. A convenience sample willbe used, comprised of youth who frequent programs and shelters designed particularly forhomeless youth in general, and homeless LGBTQ youth specifically. Julie Winkelstein will beinterviewing shelter administrators and public young adult services librarians as part of thisresearch and she will ask these administrators if there are any youth who may be interested inbeing interviewed for this research. A snowball technique will follow the initial contact, byasking participants to recommend other homeless LGBTQ youth who may be interested in beinginterviewed. The meetings will take place at a location that is considered by the youth to besecure, comfortable and convenient. In recruiting, it will be made clear to the participants that theresearch is about LGBTQ homeless youth; the researcher will reinforce this both in the informedconsent and orally.IV. METHODS AND PROCEDURESThe researcher will meet with each participant individually for a period of approximately one totwo hours. During the interview, the researcher will ask open-ended questions about theparticipant’s personal experiences with homelessness. The questions will be asked to gain insightinto the lives of these young people and how public libraries could be of help in their lives(Please see Appendix I, interview questions). Because of the length of the interview and in aneffort to record the participant’s answers as accurately as possible, with permission from theparticipant, the interview will be tape-recorded. If no permission is granted, detailed notes willbe taken. The tape recorder will be placed on the table during the interview in plain sight. Theresearcher will ask orally for consent before turning on the tape recorder and will record theconsent itself.A $10 gift card for a local coffee shop, such as Starbucks, will be offered as an incentive to eachparticipant.The data will be analyzed and interpreted by looking for themes in the answers within eachparticipant’s interview as well as among the interviews. The themes will be interpreted aspossible indicators of common concerns, challenges and needs for homeless LGBTQ youth. Theinterviews will be conducted at a mutually convenient time and location, chosen by theparticipant.V. SPECIFIC RISKS AND PROTECTION MEASURESAnonymity is not possible for the participants since the meetings will be face-to-face. Otherwise,the other greatest potential risk for this study is the risk of breach of confidentiality. To protectthe confidentiality of the participants, the tape recordings will be transcribed by one of the co-investigators. If an outside transcriber is used, he or she will sign a confidentiality agreement(Please see Appendix II, transcriber agreement). During transcription, any identifiers will beremoved and a pseudonym will be chosen for the interviewee. The co-investigators will be theonly ones to have access to these materials. The digital recordings will be stored on JulieWinkelstein’s personal password-protected computer and the original recordings on the digital236tape recorder will be erased. The recordings will be transcribed as quickly as possible and onlythe co-investigators will have access to them. The transcriptions and notes will be kept separatelyand securely from any identifiers. Since this data contributes to the research for JulieWinkelstein’s dissertation, the digital recordings will be erased from the computer at thecompletion of the dissertation.Because homeless youth are an at-risk group, a list of pertinent resources will be given to eachparticipant at the close of the interview. This list will include local agencies that are available forhomeless youth, as well as the contact information for national agencies that provide neededresources, both physical and psychological, for youth who are experiencing homelessness.(Please see Appendix III, resource list).VI. BENEFITSThe benefits to the participants will be the ability to talk about their lives in a way that mayenable public libraries to play an active and positive role. It is hoped this research will informpublic librarians as to the needs of this group, as well as the ways this group does use publiclibraries, and possible barriers that prevent them from doing so.VII. METHODS FOR OBTAINING \"INFORMED CONSENT\" FROM PARTICIPANTSThe researchers request that obtaining parental permission be waived because these youth are notin contact with their parents or legal guardians - they are homeless and do not have a consistentplace to live or adults to care for them. A written consent form will be used to obtain informedconsent from the participants for participation in the interview. (Please see Appendix IV:Informed Consent). The consent form will be read aloud and the participant will be asked to signthe form to indicate his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in thisresearch. The consent form will also include a separate signature line to acknowledge theparticipant’s willingness to be tape-recorded. The participant will receive a copy of the consentform. The signed consent forms will be kept in a locked drawer in the main School ofInformation Sciences office and will be kept separately from the transcriptions and notes. TheSchool of Information Sciences office address is: School of Information Sciences, University ofTennessee, 451 Communications Building, 1345 Circle Park Drive, Suite 451, Knoxville TN,37996-0341.Only the co-investigators will have access to the informed consent forms. After 3 years, theinformed consent forms will be destroyed. The participants will be advised that the interview isvoluntary, that they may decline to participate without penalty, and that they may withdraw fromthe study at anytime without penalty and that if they withdraw from the study before datacollection is completed, their data will be returned to them or destroyed.VIII.

The environment of a small town - where the biggest event of the year was theannual rodeo parade down the main street - combined with the influx of male scientists and theirwives had a lasting effect on her; it produced a feeling of never quite fitting in to either world.However, she enthusiastically embraced the cowboy aspect and until the age of 10, her dailyattire was a cowboy shirt, jeans, cowboy boots and a pair of six-shooters (toy) strapped to herwaist. She excelled in both math and English and decided early on that she would like to eitherbe a medical doctor or a Supreme Court justice. Most of all, however, she could see that life wasnot fair and it was her job to somehow fix that. After seven years of off-and-on college, startingas a philosophy major and then with a change of majors on each re-entry (physics, Russian anddramatic arts), she graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a B.A. indramatic arts. For the next many years, she ran a small business and then worked in publiclibraries. In 2003, she entered graduate school, graduating from San Jose State University withan MLIS in 2005. Her decision three years later to enter the PhD program in the College ofCommunication at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, was precipitated in part by herongoing concern about social justice and the ways in which public libraries could play a moreactive role in making society a more humane, loving and equitable place to live. She hopesearning a doctorate in Information and Communication will help her make a difference.",

    "abstract": "This social justice research case study was conducted in an effort to understand the role of the public library in the daily lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) homeless youth. Concerns about the influences of space, power, human rights, and marginalization informed the researcher and served as critical guides. To gain insight into this question, one-on-one interviews were conducted with public librarians, service providers who work with homeless youth, and the youth themselves. Grounded theory provided a basis for the analysis of the collected conversations.\nSix theoretical concepts of time, attitude, building relationships, welcoming, feeling safe and cultural competence, and the two core categories of creating safety and developing cultural competence emerged from the data. Out of these, came the final theoretical scheme: In order for the Library to be able to provide relevant materials and services to the homeless LGBTQ youth, it is necessary for the Library to be perceived as an emotionally safe and welcoming space by both the youth and the service providers. In addition, the librarians need to feel both physically and emotionally safe in providing this space. To create this safety requires shared cultural competence between the Library and the other two groups. This theoretical scheme offers guidance to librarians committed to the human rights issue of LGBTQ youth homelessness and interested in providing appropriate services.\nSuggestions for future research include extending this research to other cities and libraries; developing and piloting cultural competence training for all three groups; further research into existing partnerships between public libraries and service providers for homeless LGBTQ youth; research focusing on public libraries and the lives and needs of homeless transgender youth, as well as other underserved populations; and, research that examines services to young adults, ages 18 to 24, whose specific needs are not currently being routinely addressed by public libraries",
