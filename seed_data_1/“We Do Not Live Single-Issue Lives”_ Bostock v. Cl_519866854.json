The success of Mo’Nique’s claims may be impacted by a summer 2020 decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. In the landmark case Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, the Court held that Title VII’s definition of “sex” includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.14 By holding that LBGTQ+ plaintiffs have standing for Title VII claims, Bostock creates a new opportunity for intersectional claims brought by LGBTQ+ individuals with multiple identities protected by Title VII.

Ct. 1731, 1737 (2020). 2022] “WE DO NOT LIVE SINGLE-ISSUE LIVES” 465 Title VII may be used to advance intersectional discrimination claims, as further discussed in this Note. This broader, more robust interpretation of Title VII has the potential to revolutionize how courts manage discrimination claims based on multiple protected characteristics.15 Part I of this Note explains that intersectional discrimination claims are consistent with existing Title VII interpretation. Part II asserts that modern mainstreaming of intersectionality and Bostock have created a new opportunity for intersectional analysis to be used in discrimination suits. This Note concludes with the recommendation that plaintiffs should continue to pursue intersectional discrimination claims and that courts should adopt a more progressive and accurate analysis of the ways in which discrimination operates. Background A.  Intersectionality has developed beyond the boundaries of legal academia. In the late 1980s, Kimberlé Crenshaw penned a groundbreaking article that critiqued the very foundations of discrimination legal theory.16 Crenshaw argued that legal analysis marginalizes the unique forms of discrimination faced by people—especially Black women—with intersecting identities.17 Crenshaw explained that Black women are discriminated against because they are Black, because they are women, and because they are Black women.18 Crenshaw described this discrimination as traffic in an intersection: Consider an analogy to traffic in an intersection, coming and   15. This Note uses “intersectional discrimination” and its variants in the same ways as “multiple protected characteristics” and its variants. The latter distinguishes from “single protected characteristics,” or those suits in which a plaintiff alleges discrimination on the basis of one protected characteristic (e.g., national origin discrimination).  16.

Discrimination, like traffic through an intersection, may flow in one direction, and it may flow in another. If an accident happens in an intersection, it can be caused by cars traveling from any number of directions and, sometimes, from all of them. Similarly, if a Black woman is harmed because she is in the intersection, her injury could result from sex discrimination or race discrimination.19 Before it became a well-known term, intersectionality was a framework that many scholars employed in their interdisciplinary work.20 Black feminists such as bell hooks,21 Barbara Smith,22 Patricia Hill Collins,23 Audre Lorde,24 and others added to the growing body of intersectional literature. Importantly, intersectionality as a theory owes a significant amount to Black LGBTQ+ people, who were among the first to question how racism and heterosexism are interconnected.25 As Hill Collins notes, “assuming that all Black people are heterosexual and that all LGBT people are White distorts the experiences of LGBT Black people.”26 The work of these scholars and activists has paved the way for the mainstreaming of intersectionality as a way of discussing lived experiences, even outside of academic confines.27   19.

As Crenshaw puts it, “‘the thing that’s kind of ironic about intersectionality is that it had to leave town’ — the world of the law — ‘in order to get famous.’”28 After years of use by academics, the mainstream zeitgeist caught on to the term. The word “intersectionality” was added to Merriam Webster Dictionary in 2017,29 nearly 30 years after Crenshaw published her article. It has inspired a generation of activists, as well as sparked debate and controversy.30 While Crenshaw’s argument has received mainstream attention outside the legal field, it cannot be forgotten in discrimination analysis. Antidiscrimination law is fundamentally less potent when it fails to assess claims intersectionally.31 Judicial reluctance or outright refusal to incorporate intersectional analysis is “analogous to a doctor’s decision at the scene of an accident to treat an accident victim only if the injury is recognized by medical insurance.”32 The ethical underpinnings behind treating all injured patients, regardless of their insurance coverage, are the same that support remedying all injured plaintiffs, regardless of their discriminated identity. The social implications of ignoring intersectional claims impact real lives.33 When courts fail to analyze discrimination claims through an intersectional lens, marginalized people’s “issues ‘slip through the cracks’ of legal protection, and the  audience); Arica L.

Title VII has multiple frameworks to analyze employment discrimination claims. Crenshaw’s article fundamentally challenged the traditional analysis that courts apply to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.35 Title VII prohibits employers from taking adverse employment actions against its employees because of their “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”36 Title VII’s purpose was to create a cause of action for employment discrimination based on race.37 Specifically, the statute was “intended to address blatant forms of excluding African Americans from the workplace.”38 To provide the protection granted by Title VII, courts have developed two main types of claims: disparate impact and disparate treatment.39 Under the disparate treatment model, plaintiffs may offer circumstantial evidence to show discrimination.40 Alternatively, in disparate impact cases, plaintiffs allege that an employer’s facially neutral policy, in practice, discriminatorily affects a protected group of employees. 41 This Note focuses only on   34.

At the time Title VII was enacted, it was far more common for employers to refuse to hire groups of individuals from the same class.42 It was also common for employers not to promote whole categories of a protected class, such as women, or to only promote members of that class in small numbers.43 Today, however, the primary method of proving disparate treatment claims is through circumstantial, rather than direct, 44 evidence.45 Very few employers categorically refuse to hire entire groups of people based on a shared protected characteristic.46 Instead, employers’ hiring practices—conscious or subconscious—often more covertly favor or disfavor certain classes.47 As overt discrimination has diminished and covert bias has increased, circumstantial evidence has become even more important for Title VII cases.48  require a showing of intentional discrimination), for information on disparate impact cases.  42.

Hart, supra note 44 (“It is an exceedingly rare case in which a plaintiff has true direct evidence of discriminatory intent, such as a statement from the employer that ‘we don’t hire Mexicans, so you can’t have this job.’ Most Title VII cases are therefore proved through circumstantial evidence.”). 470 Law & Inequality [Vol. 40: 2 To meet their prima facie burden in circumstantial cases, the plaintiff must prove that  they 1) are a member of a protected class, 2) are qualified for their position, 3) suffered an adverse employment action, and 4) were treated differently than similarly-situated employees/applicants who are not part of their protected class.49 The burden then shifts to the employer to provide a “legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for the adverse action.50 If the employer provides such a reason, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer’s reason is actually pretext for discrimination.51 If the plaintiff proves pretext, the court may require the employer to pay the plaintiff monetary damages.52 Courts may award backpay,53 which is intended to both make the plaintiff “whole” and penalize the employer.54 Thus, Title VII uses financial damage both to remedy specific instances of discrimination and to deter future discriminatory practices.55 C.  American courts have not robustly developed intersectional cases. Courts applying Title VII have failed to adequately address the claims of plaintiffs with multiple intersecting identities.56   49.

Finally, the Tenth Circuit permitted Black women plaintiffs to “aggregate” sexual and racial harassment evidence but suggested that such discrimination was “‘additive’ rather than inextricably intertwined, mutually reinforcing, and manifest in particular stereotypes, epithets, and abuses directed toward female employees of color.”66 Intersectional legal scholars have consistently praised a few Title VII opinions. Lam v. Univ. of Hawai’i67 represents the “high water mark” of intersectionality cases.68 The court in Lam reasoned, “where two bases for discrimination exist, they cannot be neatly reduced to distinct components.”69 In Jeffers v. Thompson, the District Court for the District of Maryland reached similar conclusions on the role of intersectionality in discrimination claims, noting that “[s]ome characteristics, such as race, color, and national origin, often fuse inextricably.”70 The Jeffers court noted that Title VII undoubtedly protects against intersectional discrimination; because it prohibits each type of discrimination separately, it must prohibit any combination or intersectional discrimination as well.71 While Bostock v.

It explains that Bostock refreshed the mandate that courts focus on individual circumstances in Title VII cases, which is especially important when analyzing the nuances of intersectional discrimination. This section also argues that plaintiffs may still overcome the comparator prima facie element for Title VII claims. Finally, this section explains how intersectional discrimination claims accord with the broader theory and policy in Title VII case law. A. Intersectional analysis is consistent with the mandate of an individual focus. Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against “individual” employees.81 In Title VII discrimination cases, a general statute is being applied to specific, unique facts, including the manner and mode of reported discrimination, as well as the employee’s situation and other relevant factors.82 For that reason, it is imperative that courts focus on the circumstances of the individual plaintiffs before it.83 In Connecticut v. Teal, the Supreme Court explained that “[Title VII] prohibits practices that would deprive or tend to deprive   79. See Crenshaw, supra note 16, at 139.  80. Cf. Caldwell, supra note 33, at 372  (“Progress against racism and sexism requires in addition, therefore, not only an eradication of negative stereotypes about black womanhood and their associated behavioral consequences, but also a recognition that theories of legal protection that affect the material circumstances of black women are not marginal to theories regarding race or gender, but rather are central to both.”).

E.g., City of Los Angeles, Dep’t of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 716 (1978) (holding that the employer violated Title VII by requiring women to pay more into a pension fund because while women, as a class, on average live longer than men, each individual woman would be discriminated against if she did not reach the average life expectancy).  83. Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 453–54 (1982). 2022] “WE DO NOT LIVE SINGLE-ISSUE LIVES” 475 ‘any individual of employment opportunities.’”84 The Court further explained that “[t]he principal focus of the statute is the protection of the individual employee, rather than the protection of the minority group as a whole.”85 Teal laid the groundwork for courts to analyze plaintiffs’ experiences as individuals. Furthermore, as societal and scholarly understanding of identity develops, so does the legal view of how to apply discrimination analysis.86 Courts are recognizing that it is more accurate to analyze plaintiffs’ experiences individually than by comparing groups of employees or applicants with different identities.87 Justice Gorsuch’s majority opinion in Bostock includes notable language supporting an intersectional approach to Title VII cases.88 He emphasized the need for an individualized approach to the plaintiff’s situation in discrimination cases.89 In fact, Gorsuch points out that Title VII contains three different mandates to focus on “individuals, not groups.”90 Employers may not “fail or refuse to hire or . . . discharge any individual, or otherwise . . . discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . . sex.”91 Similarly, a court should consider a plaintiff’s position by analyzing the specific and unique forms of discrimination they may experience as a result of intersecting identities.92 Thus, the type of analysis done in intersectional discrimination cases—which requires the court to assess whether the plaintiff experienced   84.

Consider the following situation: an employee sues his employer for not promoting him based on the fact that he is a gay immigrant. Perhaps the employer believes that having a gay person with an accent or other noticeable markers of immigrant status would not be the “best face” of their management team. The company then promotes someone else who is not a gay immigrant. Bostock instructs the courts that it need not decide whether the company discriminates against gay people or immigrants more generally or even whether it discriminates against gay immigrants as a group.93 Rather, Teal and Bostock inform us that the court only has to decide whether the employer discriminated against the individual plaintiff because he is a gay immigrant. Decisions embracing the “intersectionality anti-canon”94 fail to see the plaintiffs as individuals. For example, the DeGraffenreid court feared that an intersectional approach would open a “hackneyed Pandora’s box” of different classes of protected individual, “governed only by the mathematical principles of permutation and combination.”95 DeGraffenreid’s fears are misplaced, however, because when a court analyzes a plaintiff’s claim on an individual level, it need not worry about creating a multitude of classes based on combinations of traits that are not connected to the plaintiff. The individual analysis dictum in the Bostock majority opinion has already influenced lower level courts. In Frappied v. Affinity Gaming Black Hawk, LLC, the Tenth Circuit considered the plaintiffs’ claim that they were terminated because of their sex and age.96 The court overturned precedent that would have required the plaintiffs to prove that they were treated worse than their male counterparts over forty.97 Based on Bostock, the court held that a plaintiff with multiple identities is not required to prove that their employer discriminated against either their entire class or   93. If there were evidence of systemic discrimination against gay immigrants, that would certainly bolster the plaintiff’s case.  94. See Mayeri, supra note 13, at 727.  95. DeGraffenreid v. Gen.

Similarly, he would not have to show that white transgender men as a class were treated more favorably than Black transgender men as a class. Instead, he would have to show that but for being a Black transgender man, he would still be employed. Frappied underscores Bostock’s importance. In the changing arena of Title VII interpretation, more courts may clarify case law to ensure compliance with Bostock’s emphasis on individualized analysis. Such analysis can provide an avenue for intersectional discrimination plaintiffs, such as the women in Frappied, who report disparate treatment because of their identity. B. Intersectional analysis still allows plaintiffs to meet their prima facie burden. To meet their prima facie burden, the plaintiff must show, among other elements,100 that the employer treated them differently than another similarly-situated employee of a different class.101 Appropriate comparators must be similarly situated to the plaintiff in all “material respects.”102 For example, the plaintiff can compare their treatment with the treatment of someone who had “similar job responsibilities, the same supervisor, [or] similar performance.”103 The comparator element sometimes inhibits plaintiffs arguing multi-characteristic discrimination. Some courts have been reluctant to find that the plaintiff’s proposed comparator   98. Id. at 1047.  99. Id.

Instead, intersectional discrimination plaintiffs may successfully argue the same standard as plaintiffs with only one protected characteristic: that a coworker serves as a comparator as long as they are similarly situated and not a member of the same identity. Plaintiffs may also have success in meeting their prima facie burden by providing evidence of the employer’s discrimination against other employees with the same or similar identities.108 The Jeffers plaintiff alleged sex and race discrimination, separately and in the alternative, as a combined claim.109 Jeffers notes that while “not dispositive,” evidence of a “race-and-gender” claim “includes evidence of discrimination against African–Americans (regardless of gender) and evidence of discrimination against females (regardless of race).”110 The plaintiff met her prima facie burden by showing that the employer selected a white man and a white woman   104.

Therefore, the Hicks v. Netflix court may be willing to compare Mo’Nique to other comedians, as long as the comparators are not Black women.113 At the prima facie stage, Mo’Nique can show that she is a member of protected classes, who was qualified to be a Netflix comedian, suffered an adverse employment action when Netflix did not engage in its normal negotiation practice,114 and was treated differently than similarly situated comedians who are not Black women.115 At that point, Netflix would assert any nondiscriminatory reasons for its decisions in negotiation. Mo’Nique would then have to prove that Netflix’s reasons were pretext for unlawful discrimination on the basis of her being a Black woman.116 Because not all plaintiffs have comparator options like Mo’Nique, there are a few catch-all arguments that allow plaintiffs in this situation to succeed. Some courts have noted that the plaintiff can meet their prima facie burden even if there are no potential comparators.117 For example, the Westmoreland court asked “whether a reasonable juror could conclude that the [employer] filled [the plaintiff]’s position with similarly qualified applicants outside her protected class.”118 The plaintiff in Westmoreland succeeded by presenting evidence that after she was transferred, her position was filled by two white men.119 Another avenue is to persuade a court that the prima facie case has been met, even if a comparator cannot be provided.

Id. 480 Law & Inequality [Vol. 40: 2 wrestling with the issue of how to apply the prima facie elements to intersectional discrimination cases often note that prima facie cases should not be an unmanageable hurdle for the plaintiff.120 The tradeoff for this lower burden on the plaintiff proving their prima facie case is that the ultimate burden of the case still rests on the plaintiff to show their employer’s proffered legitimate reason was actually pretext.121 Therefore, plaintiffs’ prima facie burden can be met even when they cannot proffer an appropriate comparator, which may be more difficult due to the nature of intersecting claims.122 C. Intersectional analysis is consistent with Title VII’s themes and policy. Title VII offers multiple tools to hold employers broadly accountable. The statute proscribes against firing an employee for membership to a protected class, even if the employer had other legitimate reasons to terminate them.123 Under Title VII, if an employer fires an employee for many reasons, including both legitimate and discriminatory reasons, it has still violated Title VII.124 These types of “mixed-motive” cases and the statute’s treatment of them indicate Title VII’s broader, not narrower, scope. Plaintiffs arguing intersectional discrimination cases may be more successful reminding the court that Title VII has several mechanisms, including its treatment of mixed-motive cases, that evidence its proscription of all discrimination based on the listed characteristics, not just some types of such treatment.   120.

Ct. 1731, 1739 (2020). 2022] “WE DO NOT LIVE SINGLE-ISSUE LIVES” 481 Bostock explains that an employment decision is unlawful when a protected characteristic is the but-for factor for the decision.125 The Court has employed the but-for analysis to hold that employers violated Title VII in a wide variety of situations. For example, the Court found that sex discrimination includes making employment decisions based on sex stereotypes,126 requiring women to pay more into the pension fund (rejecting the employer’s defense that the policy could not be discriminatory because it was based on the statistical evidence that, on average, women live longer than men),127 and now, terminating an employee because they are LGBTQ+.128 But-for analysis illustrates Title VII’s breadth.129 All possible discrimination claims should be considered, not just those that exclusively adhere to only sex, only race, or only other protected characteristics. Rather, this analysis supports that an individual discriminated against because of their status as a queer person of color should also be able to assert this discrimination in court. Justice Gorsuch’s opinion incidentally echoes Crenshaw’s analogy of an intersection when explaining but-for causation: “Often, events have multiple but-for causes. So, for example, if a car accident occurred both because the defendant ran a red light and because the plaintiff failed to signal his turn at the intersection, we might call each a but-for cause of the collision.”130 Bostock’s framing of but-for causation applies to intersectional claims. For example, to prevail on her argument that Netflix discriminated against her in their initial offer, Mo’Nique would   125.

Similarly, Bostock’s but-for causation test extends to people with other intersecting identities. Imagine instead that another comedian reports that she was discriminated against in negotiations because she is a transgender Latina woman.132 Her but-for argument is just as straightforward as any plaintiff claiming single-identity discrimination (e.g., a woman suing because of sex discrimination): she argues that but-for being a transgender Latina woman, she would not have been terminated. On its face, it may be difficult to see a court understanding this application of the but-for causation test. There may not be the same stereotypes or other sociological views of transgender Latina women as of cisgender Latina women,133 Latino men,134 or transgender women.135 However, the hypothetical plaintiff can assert that her employer discriminated against her because it held the same stereotypes against her as against cisgender Latina women (after all, both categories of individuals are still Latina women, regardless of their gender identity).136 Furthermore, the hypothetical plaintiff could argue that it is precisely because of the overlapping and   131.

Moreover, this discrimination is especially violent.137 There are many reasons for this higher rate of violence (which is still underreported),138 but a looming theme is clear: people with intersecting identities are more vulnerable to discrimination than others.139 The law needs to be part of their remedy, if not also perpetrators’ deterrent.140 Those decisions that make up the “intersectionality anti-canon”141 do not interpret Title VII as protecting classes of people with multiple protected identities.142 The court in DeGraffenreid found that Title VII’s legislative history did not “indicate that the goal of the statute was to create a new classification of ‘black women’ who would have greater standing than, for example, a black male.”143 Part of DeGraffenreid’s error is assuming that a Black woman’s standing would automatically be “greater” than a Black man’s standing.

An intersectional legal approach, thus, levels the field. Further, a court’s decision to not allow intersectional discrimination claims may result in plaintiff’s feeling forced to “split” their claims into categories that are mutually exclusive within the Title VII list, which is not an accurate representation of identity or lived experience.144 This traditional application of Title VII (the “anti-canon” model) is a product of all Title VII analyses being developed from the model of sex discrimination against white women or race discrimination against Black men.145 Crenshaw points out that the but-for analysis adopts the same narrowness of this model: “If Black women cannot conclusively say that ‘but for’ their race or ‘but for’ their gender they would be treated differently,” they cannot succeed on discrimination claims.146 Crenshaw’s analysis is clearly accurate under the but-for formula used by the anti-canon cases, but it appears that more contemporary courts such as Westmorland have been able to escape this mold. In the three decades since Crenshaw's Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex was published, the law has evolved to be slightly more reflective of actual lived experiences. These cases and Bostock pave the way for the mainstreaming of intersectional discrimination claims, which are consistent with Title VII and its traditional analytical framework. Part II: Bostock Opens the Door for the Mainstreaming of Intersectional Discrimination This section argues that with more plaintiffs who have standing to sue employers for Title VII discrimination, the mainstreaming of intersectionality in our culture, and the renewed excitement following the Bostock decision, there may be a similar revitalization of intersectional discrimination cases in court.    144.

At times, the Supreme Court has significantly resisted engaging in what it sees as controversial and partisan debates.161 The Court’s reluctance to use intersectional analysis is especially significant considering the robust and highly doctrinal legal scholarship that developed the framework.162 Professor Mayeri notes, however, that there is hope to see intersectional discrimination acknowledged and incorporated in the mainstream legal doctrine; women of color are not giving up on engaging with law and with courts.163 Furthermore, “Latinas, Asian-American women, LGBTQ individuals, and others have joined African American women at the forefront of intersectional advocacy as well as theory.”164 Already, there have been recent lower-level court decisions that signal a broader acceptance of intersectional analysis in discrimination cases. The District Court for South Carolina  recognized and applied what it called “intersectional discrimination theory” to its case.165 The court’s language clearly draws from the academic framework developed by Crenshaw and others: “[Title   158.

The Kimble court was impacted by EEOC guidance that allows plaintiffs to assert “Intersectional Discrimination” claims.169 The guidance explicitly states Title VII “prohibits discrimination not just because of one protected trait (e.g., race), but also because of the intersection of two or more protected bases (e.g., race and sex).”170 The nuances of intersectional theory recognized by the Eastern District of Wisconsin are profound considering the language in the anti-canon decisions of earlier decades.171 Intersectional discrimination has also found its way into recent editions of Practice Series available to employment attorneys.172   166.

Still, the footnote provides evidence that intersectional discrimination could be on the Court’s radar. And of course, footnotes have been known to change legal doctrine.175 Despite the progress, courts are clearly still wrestling with how to apply intersectional discrimination theory. For example, in Brown v. OMO Grp., Inc., the District Court acknowledged intersectional discrimination, referencing Westmorland, Kimble, and the EEOC guidance.176 But Brown also declined to analyze the plaintiff’s claims of intersectional discrimination on a more procedural matter.177 The court reasoned that it would not be appropriate to discuss the plaintiff’s intersectional discrimination objection because it was not specific enough: “Brown makes no reference to any portion of the R&R that misapplied the intersectionality theory, nor does she reference any portion of the R&R that should have applied the intersectionality theory and failed to do so.”178 With that, the Brown court dispensed with the plaintiff’s intersectional claim.179 Based on the court’s decision, it is hard to say what the plaintiff in Brown should have done instead. Perhaps the court would have considered her intersectional discrimination objection if only she had, as the court says, pointed to a place where the magistrate judge should have (but did not) consider whether she was discriminated against because she was a Black pregnant woman.

My optimism, however, is inspired by the ingenuity and passion this Note’s authorities—the Black and brown feminists, the queer activists, the courageous transgender and gender nonconforming individuals simply living their lives, and the attorneys, parties, and judges changing our legal system. This Note’s arguments are driven by those people who have found strength in their identities and have advocated on theirs and others’ behalves.195 We all have intersecting identities, but not all identities are seen equally. Title VII seeks to protect those most vulnerable to employment discrimination, even (perhaps especially) when the rest of society has not yet recognized this vulnerability. Even if Bostock is not the catalyst that brings intersectionality into case law, intersectionality as a framework is certainly here to stay, and as long as plaintiffs continue to integrate it into their advocacy, it will undoubtedly inform court opinions. Mo’Nique’s suit against Netflix is likely to be another step towards this integration. All of us with intersecting identities are indebted to hers and others’ advocacy both in and out of the courtroom.     195. See Mayeri, supra note 13, at 718–21 (discussing the intersectional origins of Title VII). ",
