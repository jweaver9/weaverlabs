    "abstract": "For as long as I can remember, the church, for me, has been a place characterized by shame and hurt. I remember Christian high school friends telling me that I would go to hell for being Queer. I remember hearing sermons from televangelists about the evils of homosexuality, and church leaders pressuring youth leaders to cast out their Queer members. I\\u27ve heard more talk of  love the sinner, hate the sin,  and  God didn\\u27t make gay,  than anyone should, and I\\u27ve even received personalized hate mail declaring that  God hates dykes.
