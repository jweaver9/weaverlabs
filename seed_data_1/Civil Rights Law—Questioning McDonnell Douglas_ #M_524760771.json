I. INTRODUCTION On August 27, 2019, nearly two dozen women who had accused Jef-frey Epstein of sexual abuse told their stories in a court of law.1 At the time they testified, Epstein had been dead for seventeen days.2 The federal prose-cutors had already announced their intention to drop the charges against Epstein—a routine response to the death of a defendant.3 Judge Richard M. Berman broke routine by ordering a hearing rather than simply dropping the charges.4 He invited Epstein’s alleged victims to speak at that hearing be-cause he understood that it was important for the women to have their day in court.5 One woman stated, “The fact that I will never have a chance to face my predator in court eats away at my soul.”6 Another woman vowed not to let Epstein or his death silence her voice.7 The hearing was described as a moment of catharsis for the victims.8 Perhaps inspired by the #MeToo Movement,9 Judge Berman recognized the alleged victims’ need to speak and to be heard.10 All too often, the judicial system fails to allow alleged victims their day in court. Title VII workplace discrimination claims are disproportionately dismissed at the summary judgment stage of litigation, depriving plaintiffs   1.

Although few, if any, mixed-motive Title VII discrimination cases may ever rise to the level of the Epstein case, the victims are no less deserving of the opportunity to be heard in a court of law than the two dozen women who spoke at Epstein’s hearing. The spirit of the #MeToo Movement encourages all victims of abuse, harassment, and discrimination to speak out about their experiences and demand that the legislature and the judicial system listen to them.23 It also requires that courts take steps to lessen the obstacles that stand before victims of discrimination and harassment. This note argues that the #MeToo Movement has created the cultural shift required for a pro-plaintiff resolution of the McDonnell Douglas circuit split, and that the Supreme Court should recognize this cultural shift by adopting the Sixth Circuit’s decision not to apply McDonnell Douglas at the summary judgment stage of mixed-motive discrimination cases. Part II of this note discusses the historical background of Title VII, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis, the mixed-motive analysis, summary judgment, and the #MeToo Movement. Part III addresses the wide circuit split regarding the appropriate application of McDonnell Douglas to mixed-motive discrimination claims at the summary judgment stage. Part IV argues that culture and law are intertwined, that the #MeToo Movement is the kind of cultural movement that supports long-term change, and that the Sixth Circuit’s approach to McDonnell Douglas best reflects and answers the #MeToo Movement’s cultural shift. II. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Title VII and workplace harassment are nebulous subjects that courts have struggled to fit tidily into a structured framework. This section de-scribes the initial intent and enactment of Title VII; examines the adoption of the McDonnell Douglas framework for assessing such claims; discusses the creation, codification, and analysis of mixed-motive claims; situates summary judgment in the Title VII discussion; and outlines the background of the #MeToo Movement.   21.

Title VII History and Purpose Congress passed Title VII as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.24 Its purpose was to protect against workplace discrimination based on race, col-or, religion, sex, and national origin.25 Initially, “sex” was introduced to the list of protected classes to deter Congress from passing the entire bill.26 Op-ponents of the Civil Rights Act reasoned that Congress would find protect-ing sex—which at that time really meant protecting women—as an entire class was too radical.27 This attempt to thwart Title VII’s enactment was unsuccessful, and the category of sex has since become one of the most liti-gated and relied upon aspects of Title VII.28 Legislative history demonstrates the importance Congress placed on handling pervasive workplace discrimination.29 Although legislators initially viewed workplace discrimination as a rare occurrence resulting from isolat-ed instances of ill-will, time and experience quickly showed otherwise.30 In 1971, the House of Representatives acknowledged that employment dis-crimination “is a far more complex and pervasive phenomenon” than origi-nally expected.31 Studies revealed that employment discrimination was a “problem . . . of ‘systems’ and ‘effects’ rather than simply intentional wrongs”32 and that “[t]he forms and incidents of discrimination which the Commission is required to treat are increasingly complex. . . . [T]heir dis-criminatory nature may not appear obvious at first glance.”33 Just six years after Title VII passed, Congress strengthened the Act in order to fight harder against employment discrimination.34 The Supreme Court of the United States has acknowledged that Con-gress intended Title VII to be sweeping, prohibitive legislation,35 and it has even further broadened Title VII’s application. In 1986, the Supreme Court extended sex discrimination claims under Title VII to include sexual har-assment, stating that “[w]ithout question, when a supervisor sexually harass-  24. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (2020).  25.

Congress provided the framework of Title VII, and the judicial branch has since attempted to fit employment discrimination claims into a formula that provides accurate and consistent results. The latter has proven more difficult than expected, and the result is that Title VII claims—particularly sex discrimination claims—create confusion.39 The Supreme Court’s adop-tion of the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis was an early at-tempt to impose a formula on Title VII cases.40 B. Adoption of the McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting Analysis The Supreme Court first adopted the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis for Title VII discrimination cases in 1973, intending to fa-cilitate consistent evaluation of workplace conduct.41 Under McDonnell Douglas, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving a prima facie case of dis-crimination.42 The burden then shifts to the defendant, requiring the defend-ant to offer proof of a legitimate, non-discriminatory motivation for the neg-ative workplace interaction.43 If the defendant does so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff, who must then rebut the defendant’s claim by offering proof of pretext.44 The Court discussed the pretext prong at length,45 and the pretext prong would later prove to be the most complex for courts.46 In its initial discussion, the Court noted that the plaintiff must “be afforded a fair opportunity to show that petitioner’s stated reason for [the plaintiff’s] rejec-  36.

Price Waterhouse and Desert Palace The 1989 Supreme Court Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins holding created a mixed-motive Title VII discrimination claim.50 Ann Hopkins had an excel-lent work record with Price Waterhouse, and several partners put her name forward for promotion.51 The partners described Hopkins as incredibly com-petent and successful, noting that she had played a significant role in a two-year project that resulted in a twenty-five million dollar contract for Price Waterhouse.52 Client comments praised her work performance, calling Hop-kins “strong and forthright” and “energetic and creative.”53 However, nega-tive comments also described Hopkins as “macho” and “suggested that she ‘overcompensated for being a woman.’”54 The Policy Board voted to put Hopkins’s promotion on hold and suggested that she would have a better chance of making partner if she “walk[ed] more femininely, talk[ed] more femininely, dress[ed] more femininely, [wore] makeup, [had] her hair styled, and [wore] jewelry.”55 The district court found that it was legitimate for Price Waterhouse to consider interpersonal skills as a criterion in its promotion decisions, and further found that Price Waterhouse’s claims about Hopkins’s interpersonal skills were not a pretext to cover outright discrimination.56 Thus, under McDonnell Douglas, Price Waterhouse had met its burden of rebutting Hopkins’s prima facie case by providing a legitimate, non-discriminatory motivation.57 However, the district court found that impermissible gender stereotypes had, at least in part, motivated Price Waterhouse’s decision.58   47.

There was no need to prove pretext when an em-ployer responded to allegations by providing some legitimate, non-discriminatory motivation because mixed-motive claims allowed for the possibility that employers might have both discriminatory and non-discriminatory motivations. Additionally, many lower courts interpreted Justice Sandra O’Connor’s concurrence in Price Waterhouse to require a mixed-motive plaintiff to pro-vide direct evidence of discrimination.63 In Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, the Supreme Court determined otherwise.64 Catherine Costa filed suit against her employer, Desert Palace, for sex discrimination.65 She claimed that she had been stalked, disciplined more harshly than men, “treated less favorably than men in the assignment of overtime,” and discriminated against by her employers who “stacked” her disciplinary record and “used or tolerated” gender-based slurs against her.66 The case went to a jury trial, and at the conclusion of the trial, the jury received instruction on evaluating whether Costa had proven her claims. Desert Palace objected to the mixed-motive jury instructions, noting that they did not specify that the plaintiff must pro-  59. Id. at 237.  60. Id.  61. Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub L.

Id. 106 UA LITTLE ROCK LAW REVIEW [Vol. 43 vide “direct evidence,” as required by Justice O’Connor’s concurrence, but not in the text of the 1991 Act.67 The Supreme Court held that the text of the 1991 Act superseded Jus-tice O’Connor’s Price Waterhouse concurring opinion, and thus there was no need to analyze her “direct evidence” statements nor to determine if her concurring opinion was Price Waterhouse’s holding.68 The Supreme Court then noted that the text of the 1991 Act calls for the plaintiff to “‘demon-strate’ that an employer used a forbidden consideration,” which alone does not require direct evidence.69 Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff is not required to provide direct evidence of discrimination and the jury instruction provided was sufficient.70 Justice O’Connor wrote a separate concurrence, acknowledging that the 1991 Act allowed for both direct and circumstantial evidence to prove mixed-motive claims.71 Desert Palace’s holding that plaintiffs could use either direct or cir-cumstantial evidence of discrimination to prove mixed-motive cases further confused courts.72 Generally, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analy-sis governed where plaintiffs had not provided direct evidence of discrimi-nation.73 After Desert Palace, the distinction between McDonnell Douglas Title VII cases and mixed-motive Title VII cases blurred even further.74 Consistent, accurate evaluation thus became that much harder at any litiga-tion stage—particularly the summary judgment stage.

See generally Beiner, supra note 11, at 102; Chin, supra note 11, at 672.

Munyon, 247 Ark. 449, 467 (1969). A court must view the entire record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in favor of the nonmov-ing party.

R. CIV. P. 56(a). 2020] QUESTIONING MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 107 crimination cases are disproportionately unsubstantiated. Rather, it is in part because applying the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting standard at the summary judgment stage increases the burden on Title VII plaintiffs.76 Ac-curately navigating an intricate and confusing set of standards based on pleadings and discovery alone is a potentially insurmountable task—certainly one that the courts have struggled to undertake with any measure of consistency. Nevertheless, reliance on summary judgment grows. In 1986, a trio of Supreme Court cases collectively paved the way for increased reliance on summary judgment.77 Anderson v. Liberty Lobby held that, at the summary judgment stage, courts must not only determine if there is a factual dispute but also whether the plaintiff has met the requisite evi-dentiary burden applicable at trial.78 Celotex Corp. v. Catrett held that a de-fendant may successfully move for summary judgment if the defendant can demonstrate that the plaintiff does not have sufficient evidence to meet the evidentiary burden, effectively requiring plaintiffs to “meet the ultimate burden of proof at the summary judgment stage.”79 In Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., the Supreme Court determined that courts may assess matters of intent and motive at the summary judgment stage and even suggested that the courts should weigh evidence.80 This trio of cases made it much easier for courts to justify granting summary judg-ment, even in nuanced, fact-based cases traditionally reserved for juries.81 Following this trio of decisions, the approach to summary judgment began to change. Federal Judge Patricia Wald wrote in 1998 that summary judgment, “fueled by the overloaded dockets of the last two decades . . . has spread swiftly through the underbrush of undesirable cases, taking down some healthy trees as it goes.”82 The result is that only plaintiffs who can present a strong case based only on pleadings can hope to survive a motion for summary judgment.83   76.

Id. at 1942. 108 UA LITTLE ROCK LAW REVIEW [Vol. 43 Summary judgment has taken on an increased role for sex discrimina-tion cases in particular. Prior to the 1990s, courts in the Eighth Circuit re-peatedly stated that summary judgment was disfavored in employment dis-crimination cases because such cases often required intent determinations and were “inherently fact-based.”84 However, as the 1990s progressed, the Eighth Circuit courts referenced this disfavor while nevertheless granting summary judgment with increasing frequency.85 In 2011, the Eighth Circuit abandoned pretense, stating, “There is no ‘discrimination case exception’ to the application of summary judgment, which is a useful pretrial tool to de-termine whether any case, including one alleging discrimination, merits a trial.”86 District Judge Milton I. Shadur stated that courts were particularly prone to granting summary judgment in employee discrimination cases.87 In a Second Circuit case, Judge Jack Weinstein observed a “robust use” of summary judgment in sex discrimination cases—a trend he found particular-ly dangerous.88 As reliance on summary judgment increased, the circuit split regarding the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis controversy became more significant. The truth of plaintiff experiences can easily get lost in the barren nature of black text on white paper, and the complexity of relationships and interactions fades when forced into a clinical formula. The burden this reli-ance creates for the plaintiff only worsens when courts apply inconsistent and even contradictory formulas. After Desert Palace, there are at least four different applications of McDonnell Douglas to mixed-motive claims at the summary judgment stage of litigation.89 Mixed-motive plaintiffs facing po-tential summary judgment may find more consistency in a random roll of the dice than in the judge’s chambers.   84.

The #MeToo Movement Overlapping and confusing evidentiary structures currently serve as a stumbling block to discrimination plaintiffs, but there is momentum for change. The #MeToo Movement is a cultural movement, spurred on by the power of social media, that demands justice for victims of sexual harass-ment, abuse, and assault.90 It exploded onto the global scene in 2017 when actress Alyssa Milano tweeted the #MeToo hashtag91 and told her thousands of followers to retweet her message if they had also experienced sexual har-assment or violence.92 The Movement has since taken over media, influ-enced politics, and infiltrated the legal system.93 In just the twenty-four hours after Alyssa Milano’s initial #MeToo post, over one million people tweeted or retweeted the #MeToo hashtag.94 Through the #MeToo hashtag, many people shared stories of sexual harassment and abuse, creating a na-tional conversation and building momentum for change. Many of those sto-ries centered on workplace interactions.95 Harvey Weinstein, a Hollywood mogul who produced numerous blockbuster movies, faced intense media backlash after Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan publicly accused him of sexual harassment and sexual as-sault.96 Following Judd and McGowan’s accusations, a chorus of other women who had worked with and for Harvey Weinstein told their stories, connecting them to the #MeToo Movement.97 The picture was bleak. This man who had achieved professional greatness in the film industry had used his power, success, and fame as a means to harass, assault, bully, and con-  90. Jerkins, supra note 23.  91.

Women in Hollywood began to expose the rampant sexual harassment and abuse that took place in the power-hungry industry.99 Charlie Rose, a highly respected television journalist, lost his position at CBS after several women accused him of sexual harassment, bullying, and indecent behavior in the work-place.100 CBS CEO Les Moonves also lost his job after multiple women ac-cused him of sexual harassment in the workplace.101 Comedian Louis C.K, politician Al Franken, and actor Kevin Spacey all saw their careers suffer or end after multiple sexual harassment or assault allegations.102 As #MeToo gained momentum, its influence grew beyond Hollywood. Roy Moore, a Republican senate candidate from Alabama, ran and lost a campaign completely overshadowed by the improper sexual conduct allega-tions against him.103 After approximately 150 women came forward accus-ing former USA gymnastics team doctor, Larry Nasser, of sexual abuse, he pled guilty to child pornography charges and was sentenced to sixty years in prison.104 In 2019, renewed accusations against Jeffrey Epstein surfaced, though Epstein had previously accepted a plea deal after facing charges for sexually abusing underage girls.105 In the months prior to Epstein’s July 6th arrest, many new victims, inspired by #MeToo Movement culture, had be-  98.

The #MeToo Movement created a “watershed moment,” and it was not long before the Movement had a legal branch.110 On January 1, 2018, The New York Times ran an open letter announcing “Time’s Up,” an initiative created by three hundred women in Hollywood.111 Time’s Up included (1) a legal defense fund to help protect underprivileged women against sexual harassment or abuse and the consequences of reporting it, (2) proposed leg-islation to penalize companies that allow persistent sexual misconduct, (3) a plan to promote gender parity in male-dominated fields, such as the film industry, and (4) a call for women attending the Golden Globes to wear black as a method of raising awareness.112 Time’s Up’s ultimate goal was to make sure that women who traditionally did not have voices in society were heard.113 Since its creation in 2018, Time’s Up has helped pay legal fees for victims of harassment and discrimination and promoted important legisla-tive changes.114 Once #MeToo branched into legislation, it transcended a mere cultural movement and began to fuel long-term change. One of the most prominent #MeToo legal discussion centers on non-disclosure agreements that power-ful employers require employees to sign in order to keep them silent.115 It   106.

Vison, the United States Supreme Court ruled that conduct qualifies as “harassment” when it is so “severe or pervasive” that it alters the terms or conditions of employment.119 However, “severe and pervasive” is a vague term that courts often interpret narrowly and against the plaintiff’s interests.120 Legal scholars have hypothesized about why “severe and pervasive” has become a legal barrier. One suggestion is that the courts’ interpretation of “severe and pervasive” stems from a few key early cases that provide an abundance of legal justification for judges who wish to dismiss future har-assment cases.121 Another explanation is that courts are hesitant to cross the line into interfering with normal workplace activity.122 The Eighth Circuit has observed that the Supreme Court has indicated that teasing, offhand comments, gender-related jokes, and “sporadic use of abusive language,” do not usually rise to the level of sexual harassment.123 Ultimately, the Eighth Circuit concluded that behavior might be “vile or inappropriate” without “ris[ing] to the level of actionable sexual harass-ment.”124 In 2009, the Eighth Circuit held that a supervisor who rubbed an employee’s back and shoulders, called her “baby doll,” complained that she didn’t want to be “one of his girls,” suggested that she go to bed with him, and implied to her that “getting along with him” would be good for her ca-reer had not engaged in actionable sexual harassment.125   116.

Although the #MeToo Movement has already begun to inspire legal change, its potential will be stunted if the legal system does not harness the power of the Movement to resolve the contradictory and overlapping stand-ards courts use to evaluate Title VII claims. As long as the courts remain split on how to determine if the plaintiff gets into the courtroom, there can be little true advancement. The Supreme Court should consider the cultural shift associated with the #MeToo Movement when resolving the McDonnell Douglas circuit split and adopt the Sixth Circuit’s approach that allows more plaintiffs into court. III. THE CIRCUIT SPLIT After Desert Palace, there is great disparity in how the circuits analyze mixed-motive Title VII cases at the summary judgment stage. The Eighth and Eleventh Circuits have held that Desert Palace had no impact on the McDonnell Douglas summary judgment analysis for mixed-motive Title VII cases.128 The Fifth Circuit has applied a modified McDonnell Douglas anal-ysis to mixed-motive case.129 The Fourth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits have at-tempted to find the middle ground, allowing plaintiffs to proceed under McDonnell Douglas or provide direct or circumstantial evidence of discrim-ination.130 The First, Third, and Tenth Circuits have avoided deciding whether Desert Palace has altered the summary judgment analysis for mixed-motive cases,131 and the Second and Seventh Circuits have not yet considered the issue.132 The Sixth Circuit, an outlier, has held that, after De-sert Palace, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis does not apply   126.

A. Holding Fast: The Eighth and Eleventh Circuits The Eighth Circuit has held that Desert Palace did not alter the McDonnell Douglas analysis in any way.134 The court reasoned that Desert Palace involved a post-trial jury instruction about mixed-motive cases—not a summary judgment issue—and did not reference or even cite to McDon-nell Douglas.135 While the Eighth Circuit acknowledged that summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law standards typically reflect each other, it noted that the context for the two processes is significantly differ-ent.136 At the judgment as a matter of law stage, the court must consider whether the presence of multiple motives, both legitimate and illegitimate, defeats the plaintiff’s case,137 whereas at the summary judgment stage, the only appropriate consideration is whether there is sufficient evidence of a discriminatory motive.138 Given these two different contexts, the Eighth Cir-cuit held that Desert Palace did not apply to summary judgment analysis.139 In Cooper v. Southern Co., the Eleventh Circuit relies on the same ar-guments that the Eighth Circuit made regarding the relationship—or lack thereof—between Desert Palace and McDonnell Douglas.140 The Cooper plaintiffs had argued that Desert Palace overruled McDonnell Douglas and placed a heavier burden on defendant to prove that it would have still acted without the discriminatory motive.141 The court rejected this argument, stat-ing that Desert Palace narrowly addressed jury instructions in mixed-motive cases, that Desert Palace had not referred to McDonnell Douglas, and that for some time after Desert Palace, the Eleventh Circuit had continued to apply McDonnell Douglas at the summary judgment stage without contra-diction.142 Though the court’s discussion of this issue is brief and hidden in a footnote of a disparate-impact case, its reasoning indicates that the Eleventh Circuit aligns with the Eighth Circuit, concluding that Desert Palace did not alter the application of McDonnell Douglas.143   133.

As a result, fewer plaintiffs have the opportunity to be heard in a court of law, to put their case to a jury, or to face those whom they accuse.144 In the Eighth and Eleventh Circuits, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis routinely keeps plaintiffs out of the courtroom.145 B. Middle Ground and Modification: The Fourth, Ninth, D.C., and Fifth Circuits The Fourth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits apply “middle ground” versions of McDonnell Douglas, all taking a similar approach.146 The Fifth Circuit has modified the McDonnell Douglas analysis for mixed-motive claims, blending McDonnell Douglas and Price Waterhouse into one formula.147 This subsection will first address the Fourth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits mid-dle-ground application of McDonnell Douglas post-Desert Palace, then address the Fifth Circuit’s modified approach to the same. 1. McDonnell Douglas Middle Ground   The Fourth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits interpret the Desert Palace hold-ing to require that plaintiffs present either direct or circumstantial evidence of discrimination or proceed under the McDonnell Douglas pretext formu-la.148 In April of 2002, Rovilma Diamond, an African-American woman, filed a claim against Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company for wrongful denial of promotion and retaliation.149 When the court granted summary judgment against Diamond, she appealed, arguing that Desert Palace had done away with the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analy-sis at the summary judgment stage and that courts must analyze all Title VII claims as mixed-motive claims.150 The Fourth Circuit rejected Diamond’s reasoning and affirmed its post-Desert Palace precedent, which allows plaintiffs to survive summary judg-ment by either (1) providing “direct or circumstantial evidence that raises a   144.

Circuit has also adopted, in practical effect, the same analysis structure.155 This middle-ground approach incorporates the Desert Palace holding into its summary judgment analysis. The result provides more opportunity for plaintiffs to raise an issue of fact at the summary judgment stage than the Eighth and Eleventh Circuits’ approaches.156 However, it leaves intact the McDonnell Douglas structure, to which the court still defaults if the em-ployer rebuts the plaintiff’s evidence of discrimination with some legitimate, non-discriminatory motivation.157 2. The Fifth Circuit and McDonnell Modification The Fifth Circuit modified McDonnell Douglas itself.158 In 2004, the Fifth Circuit considered Ahmed Rachid’s age discrimination case, which he had lost at the summary judgment stage.159 The Fifth Circuit’s holding blended McDonnell Douglas with Price Waterhouse.160 The court noted that Desert Palace had made it more difficult to distinguish between the mixed-motive analysis and the McDonnell Douglas analysis; thus one structure that accommodated both analyses was most appropriate.161 In the modified struc-ture, the first two prongs of McDonnell Douglas remain the same—the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case and the defendant must offer some legitimate, non-discriminatory motivation for the negative employment ac-tion.162 At the third prong, the plaintiff may establish either (1) that the de-  151.

Circuit’s approach is difficult to ascertain. Both approaches attempt to incorporate the Desert Palace holding into es-tablished precedent, but neither are willing to go so far as to say that the McDonnell Douglas framework is no longer applicable to mixed-motive cases. Only the Sixth Circuit has adopted that approach.165 C. The Outlier: The Sixth Circuit In White v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., the Sixth Circuit abandoned McDonnell Douglas at the summary judgment stage of Title VII mixed-motive cases because the three-prong analysis was “onerous.”166 The court reasoned that imposing such a burdensome standard on plaintiffs contradict-ed legislative intent and judicial precedent.167 The Sixth Circuit noted that “since Desert Palace, the federal courts of appeals have, without much, if any, consideration of the issue, developed widely differing approaches to the question of how to analyze summary judgment challenges in Title VII mixed-motive cases.”168 Prior to White, the Sixth Circuit had side-stepped several opportunities to decide how Desert Palace affected its Title VII mixed-motive case precedents.169 However, the White majority opinion demonstrated careful consideration of the issue and a confident ruling.170 The Sixth Circuit’s primary motivation for abandoning McDonnell Douglas for mixed-motive Title VII cases was that the burden-shifting anal-ysis simply was not useful nor relevant to assessing whether the plaintiff had provided evidence of a discriminatory motive.171 Not only had Desert Pal-ace blurred the line between the mixed-motive analysis and the McDonnell Douglas analysis, but the very nature of the mixed-motive case eradicated the need for any pretext evidence at the summary judgment stage.172 All the   163.

The court engaged in none of the parsing of intermediate evidentiary burdens and comparisons of different standards that other circuits did when explaining why and how McDonnell Douglas is still appropriate for mixed-motive cases. Rather, the court clearly and concisely got to the heart of the issue—there is no place for discussions of pretext in mixed-motive cases and forcing that discussion is overly burdensome to the plaintiff.175 The Sixth Circuit well demonstrates that the tangled knot of evidentiary burdens and analysis structures obstructs the ultimate goal—to allow plaintiffs who have demonstrated genuine issues of material facts to speak in a court of law.176 The Sixth Circuit’s reasoning both reflects the legislative intent orig-inally behind Title VII and the cultural shift toward hearing victims that the #MeToo movement has created. IV. CULTURAL MOMENTUM AND LEGAL CHANGE Like the Sixth Circuit, proponents of the #MeToo Movement argue for erring on the side of hearing victims. This cultural movement has already bled into the legal field, and it has the potential to continue to demand legal change. To demonstrate the legal impact cultural movements can have, this section first examines the relationship between culture and law, arguing that a cultural shift must occur if legal change is going to have practical effect. It then argues that the #MeToo Movement is the kind of social movement that can support legal change. Finally, this section argues that the #MeToo Movement has created a cultural shift that demands and can support adopt-ing the Sixth Circuit’s pro-victim approach as a resolution of the McDonnell Douglas circuit split.

See generally id. 2020] QUESTIONING MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 119 rate.177 Law professors Gerald Torres and Lani Guinier have written exten-sively about the relationship between social movements and legal change, concluding that without a cultural shift, true lawmaking does not occur.178 Torres and Guinier developed the term “demosprudence,” a concept that claims that “social movement activism is as much a source of law as are statutes and judicial decisions.”179 Torres and Guinier do not argue that so-cial movement activism influences lawmaking—rather, they argue that so-cial movement is an intrinsic part of lawmaking because it changes “the sense of what is practically possible and the sense of what is possible to im-agine.”180 In other words, lawmaking occurs when a change in the rules brings the law in line with a cultural shift that has already taken place.181 To look more closely at this relationship between culture and lawmaking, this Note will briefly contrast the progression of African American rights and LGBTQ rights.182 The development of African American rights demonstrates that legal change without cultural support is largely ineffective. After the Civil War, the Reconstruction Congress passed legislation that abolished slavery, pro-vided citizenship regardless of race, and guaranteed voting rights regardless of race.183 Additionally, Congress adopted a series of civil rights laws in-tended to undermine pervasive racism and promote equality.184 Southern states resisted these laws, adopting systems that allowed them to retain their racist constructs despite the new legislation—systems like sharecropping   177.

These discussions are over-views, intended only to establish the different outcomes when there is or is not cultural sup-port for a legal change. Given that both the African American and LGBTQ civil rights movements are outside the scope of this article, the treatment of each is purely a summation that unfortunately glosses over the struggles, successes, and failures of each.

Society and the courts ig-nored, actively circumvented, and delegitimized the laws that Congress had passed.186 It was not until the 1950s and 1960s, when powerful activism be-gan a cultural shift toward tolerance and inclusion, that effective civil rights lawmaking occurred. During the Reconstruction era, lawmakers attempted to legislate tolerance and inclusion that society—Southern society in par-ticular—was not willing to accept, effectively making the laws moot. Conversely, the LGBTQ movement demonstrates that cultural change can accelerate legal change by making a previously invisible, criminalized group of people so visible that legal change rapidly follows. In the 1990s, a cultural shift in the way that people viewed LGBTQ people occurred, and as a result, courts began to reason differently about LGBTQ rights.187 Multiple LGBTQ-favorable legal decisions followed, beginning to change the land-scape of LGBTQ rights. In 1983, approximately seventy-five percent of people stated that they did not know anyone who was LGBTQ.188 Thirty years later, eighty-seven percent of people said they did know a person who is LGBTQ.189 This increase in exposure to LGBTQ people has mirrored an increase in acceptance of LGBTQ lifestyles, and the Supreme Court’s deci-sions have mirrored that increase in acceptance.190 In 1986, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that homosexual sodomy was not a protected right, just thirty-two percent of Americans believed that consensual homo-sexual sex should be legal.191 In 2003, when the Supreme Court reversed that decision, more than sixty percent of Americans already believed con-sensual homosexual sex should be legal.192 Similarly, in 2014, public sup-port for same-sex marriage rose to an all-time high, just one year before the Court’s Obergefell holding created marriage equality.193 These two examples clearly demonstrate that cultural and legal ad-vancement must occur together, and change is swifter and more effective   185.

These examples support Torres and Guinier’s proposition that social change impacts what people believe to be possible.194 Attempting to enforce laws that do not reflect the culture of a society inevitably results in that society finding a way around or ignoring the spirit of those laws. How-ever, when changing the rule brings the law in line with a true cultural shift, real change takes place. B.  The #MeToo Movement Has Opened the Door to Legal Change The #MeToo Movement has increased the visibility of discrimination and sexual assault victims, generating public support for holding victimizers accountable. It has begun to chip away at the shame that victims have often felt about telling their story, and it has normalized holding abusers account-able. #MeToo has become a household term, permeating the national con-sciousness through the power of social media,195 working its way into politi-cal discussions, and taking on legal force. It is a cultural movement that can support legal change. Thomas B. Stoddard identified four factors that must be present in a social movement before it can effect true change.196 Those factors are “(1) A change that is . . . broad or profound; (2) Public awareness of that change; (3) A general sense of the legitimacy (or validity) of the change; and (4) . . . continuous enforcement of the change.”197 Stoddard’s assertion is well-founded, as social movements can at times be fleeting, socially unpopular, or unenforceable. Such movements may not be able to inspire or support a rule change. The #MeToo Movement easily meets Stoddard’s four factors. The #MeToo Movement has created “broad or profound” change be-cause it has changed what victims of sexual discrimination, harassment, or violence collectively believe that they have to endure. This is evidenced by the number of people who continue to speak out and face potential backlash because they know that they do not have to suffer alone in silence. Instead, there is an assurance that if they speak out, society will validate their protest and take action. The media focus of the #MeToo Movement ensures that there is wide-spread “public awareness” of the change that has occurred. Although some criticize social media activists, on the whole social media platforms provide a voice to those who otherwise would not have the resources or the oppor-tunity to be heard.198 #MeToo’s potential for creating change is largely root-  194.

The overwhelming response to #MeToo accusers is support and encouragement, demonstrating the legit-imacy Stoddard requires.205 Hashtags such as “#BelieveWomen,” “#Be-lieveSurvivors,” and “#WhyIDidn’tReport” have dominated social media.206   199.

Whether or not it is always popular, people continue to tell their stories of victimization. Harvey Weinstein, whose victims started the present incar-nation of the #MeToo Movement, has been convicted of a criminal sex act in the first degree and rape in the third degree.208 His victims continue to speak out against him, bringing the #MeToo momentum full circle to hold accountable the man who terrorized Hollywood for decades. In 2018, a jury convicted Bill Cosby of sexual assault, proving “that there is accountabil-ity.”209 In 2017, pop icon Taylor Swift sued radio DJ David Mueller for lift-ing her skirt and touching her inappropriately.210 She requested one symbolic dollar in damages, and she spoke bluntly in the courtroom, refusing to be intimidated by the tactics of the defendant’s lawyer.211 The president of the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network stated that Swift’s principled claim was “a great demonstration to other victims that there is strength in coming forward and pursing [sic] justice.”212 Whether by costing a perpetra-tor his career, convicting him in court, or demanding a dollar as a symbolic admission of guilt, accusers are enforcing change and people are taking no-tice. Thus, the #MeToo Movement meets Stoddard’s four factors social movements must have to effect true change.213 The discussion surrounding sexual harassment and discrimination has permanently changed.

Even the language surrounding sexual harassment has changed, incorporating social media hashtags and new terminology. Most importantly, it has become harder to silence victims who want to be heard. They can speak in the public sphere, and they ought to be able to speak in court as well. C. The Court Must Walk Through the Open Door Adopting the Sixth Circuit’s approach to McDonnell Douglas at the summary judgment stage of mixed-motive discrimination cases changes the rules to reflect the cultural change that has already occurred. The Sixth Cir-cuit’s approach strips away the overly-complex, blurred, and overlapping formulas that have developed over years of ad hoc modifications. It opens the courtroom to discrimination plaintiffs so that they can be heard. The Eighth and Eleventh Circuits’ approaches are outdated—reflective of a cul-ture that no longer dominates society. The middle ground and modified McDonnell Douglas approaches make advancements but still do not fully answer the cultural demand for hearing victims. Adopting the Sixth Circuit’s White holding should be part of the national answer to the #MeToo Move-ment’s demand for alleged victims to be given greater access to justice. Embracing the #MeToo Momentum would not be a step away from what Congress and the courts originally intended. Rather, adopting the Sixth Circuit’s White holding would bring greater alignment with legislative intent and judicial precedent.214 The legislative intent behind Title VII was always to eradicate workplace harassment and provide a lenient and all-encompassing avenue of relief for victims of workplace discrimination, har-assment, and assault.215 The Supreme Court has consistently expanded Title VII’s scope, with Congress’s express support.216 Title VII is intended to be a broad umbrella under which plaintiffs can find shelter—not a narrow open-ing through which only a few can fit. Similarly, McDonnell Douglas was never meant to be a roadblock for plaintiffs, 217 and the #MeToo Movement should provide the cultural momentum required to push the obstacle out of the way. V. CONCLUSION Though it was never intended to be, McDonnell Douglas is a burden-some standard for Title VII mixed-motive plaintiffs. The #MeToo Move-  214. Supra Part II, Section A.  215.
