Now, Student Veteran Services may see an impact as the office awaits the sum of money that usually arrives at the beginning of every month.The government shut-down — now in its third week — could suspend claim processing for different vet-erans benefits, as well as sur-viving spouses and depen-dents. This includes halting compensation payments for more than 5.1 million veter-ans, Eric Shinseki, secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, said before the House Committee on Veteran Affairs Wednesday.Each of the 809 students using these benefits on cam-pus receive between $200 and $2,000 a month, said Ben Armstrong, director of Student Veteran Services.“Although we are not re-quired to do anything as an institution, we realize that this money is very important to our students,” Armstrong said. “Some of them may not be able to pay their bills or even get to class. We are working to find what abilities we have in order to help these students.”Student Veteran Services has been in contact with the Office of Financial Aid, Of-fice of the Registrar and the Office of Accounting to see what steps would be taken if these students did not re-ceive their money.Jamie Brown, communi-cations coordinator at the Office of Student Financial Services, said there is no set plan, but there will be a meet-ing later this week to discuss available options.“Generally, we’re going to work with these students on an individual basis and help them as we would any stu-dent in an emergency situa-tion,” Brown said.Armstrong said 55 percent of these student veterans are 25 to 30 years old, and 18 percent are 31 to 35 years old, many of whom have families that rely on them.Mathematics sophomore Daniel Penuelaz returned from duty almost four years ago and decided to go back to school because of the post-9/11 GI Bill that would pay for most of his education and housing.As a husband and father of two children in San An-tonio, Penuelaz said he relies Wednesday, October 16, 2013@thedailytexan facebook.com/dailytexanServing the University of Texas at Austin community since 1900dailytexanonline.com bit.ly/dtvidSPORTS PAGE 6 COMICS PAGE 7 LIFE&ARTS PAGE 8CAMPUSNATIONALVandalism poses problems for UT policeRandom graffiti around campus and busted exit signs in residence halls cause head-aches for University police and administration, and ac-cording to officials, they are the most prevalent types of vandalism around campus.Officer Layne Brewster of UTPD’s crime prevention unit said graffiti is the most frequently reported type of vandalism on campus. From Jan. 1 to Oct. 14, Brewster said there have been 70 reports of graffiti of all forms — with re-stroom stalls, newspaper dis-pensers, trash cans and utility poles tagged regularly.UT Facilities Services spokeswoman Laurie Lentz said Facilities Services is responsible for all graffiti cleanup on campus. Lentz said Facilities has four teams that cover four zones on cam-pus. These teams, or “Zones,” are the first responders for outdoor graffiti removal.Zone 2 supervisor Herb Woerndell said his team oversees maintenance of the central campus area, which encompasses most buildings on the original 40 Acres.“We all get our hands into some graffiti,” Woerndell said. “Zone 2 is one of the highest visibility areas, and I get tagged pretty hard now and then.”Woerndell said Walter Webb Hall, which is across the street from the Jesse H. Jones Communications Cen-ter, is a go-to canvas for graf-fiti artists and is tagged two to three times a month.“The black wall facing Gua-dalupe Street is like a blackboard for graffiti,” Woerndell said. “Sometimes I guess what they do is climb a tree on the north side and get on the roof of the WWH and spray paint the wall over there. That’s been tagged more than a few times.”From Jan. 1 to Oct. 14, UTPD responded to 93 re-ports of criminal mischief. Brewster said broken exit signs in residence halls are among the highest reported incidents. According to UTPD’s Campus Watch report, three separate reports of damaged exit signs inside Jester West were report-ed in the past week. Aaron Voyles, area man-ager for the University’s Di-vision of Housing and Food Services, said broken exit signs are a recurring prob-lem and should not be taken By Alberto Long@albertolongVANDALISM page 3UNIVERSITYShutdown may suspend veteran benefitsUT research looks at favor-itism and discrimination.PAGE 3UT research links early pu-berty to substance abuse.

Tarot reader finds harmony when helping othersOFFBEATAngeliska Polacheck might be the nicest witch in Austin.Polacheck opened Sister Temperance Tarot in 2011. The native Austinite inher-ited her first deck of cards from her mother and began working with the cards at age 11. After moving to New Or-leans in 1999, Polacheck be-gan reading for the public at Esoterica, an occult shop in the French Quarter.Polacheck describes her-self as a witch, but not the green-skinned character of popular imagination.“In my mind, a witch is someone who does spiritual work for [her] community,” Polacheck said. “We only work in service. We’re there to help others.”Tarot card reading is more than picking a few cards out of a deck and predicting the future. Polacheck said the cards work as a physi-cal means to identify issues within her clients’ lives.“The reality is that the fu-ture is not written in stone,” Polacheck said. “It’s not pre-determined what is going to happen. I believe that there are no accidents, but I also believe that we create and manifest our own future. So it can work positively or negatively.”Olivia Pepper, another lo-cal tarot reader, agreed that this misconception couldn’t be further from the truth.By Elizabeth Williams@bellzabethBy Nicole Cobler@nicolecoblerPublic universities and their students could be particularly vulnerable to a potential U.S. debt ceiling crisis Thursday, which would have national and global implications.The debt ceiling marks the maximum amount of debt the U.S. is allowed to hold before it can no longer borrow money to finance federal spending. The U.S. government is pro-jected to hit this ceiling Oct. 17 if Congress does not vote to raise the debt ceiling limit. Should the amount of debt hit the ceiling, the U.S. could be forced to default on its debt, meaning that at some point it would no longer be able to fulfill its obligations to finance programs such as Social Secu-rity and Medicare. Congress may choose to avoid default-ing by raising the debt ceil-ing, which would increase the amount of money the U.S. is allowed to borrow.Olivier Coibion, assistant professor of economics and monetary policy expert, said he expects spending on public universities to be By Lizzie Jespersen@LizzieJespersenDEBT page 2SHUTDOWN page 2TAROT page 522 NEWSWednesday, October 16, 2013Main Telephone(512) 471-4591EditorLaura Wright(512) 232-2212editor@dailytexanonline.comManaging EditorShabab Siddiqui(512) 232-2217managingeditor@dailytexanonline.comNews Office(512) 232-2207news@dailytexanonline.comMultimedia Office(512) 471-7835dailytexanmultimedia@ gmail.comSports Office(512) 232-2210sports@dailytexanonline.comLife & Arts Office(512) 232-2209dtlifeandarts@gmail.comRetail Advertising(512) 471-1865joanw@mail.utexas.eduClassified Advertising(512) 471-5244classifieds@ dailytexanonline.comCONTACT USVolume 114, Issue 45COPYRIGHTCopyright 2013 Texas Student Media.

He said these changes in spending could have long-term effects on students. “Students who finish school during an eco-nomic downturn tend to experience permanently worse careers and earn less income than those who graduate during booms,” Coibion said. “This type of economic event could have a direct and long-lived ef-fect on students.”Economics senior Crys-tal Luviano said it has been difficult to keep up with updates on the debt ceil-ing. She said she was unsure about how it could poten-tially affect students such as herself.“But maybe if interest rates go up, student loans will be more unattainable and grants would decrease,” Luviano said. “The govern-ment wouldn’t have as many grants and scholarships to loan out to students.”For one UT research as-sociate, the government shut-down has already affected his research, and now the poten-tial of hitting the debt ceiling continues to raise concerns. Joe Levy, geosciences re-search associate and lecturer, studies climate history by ob-serving the ways glaciers and ice sheets have shaped the landscapes of Antarctica. His project was suspended when the government shut down. Levy said the federal agencies that support public universities’ research have not been growing at a fast enough rate to sustain cur-rent research growth. He said defaulting would not make the possibility of funding in-creases look promising.“Fewer researchers at the University will be looking for students to help with research projects,” Levy said. “Students will have fewer opportunities for summer internships and labs. That’s a pity, because it’s great to be in a place where students are doing pretty cut-ting-edge research.”Lewis Spellman, finance professor and capital mar-kets expert, said even if the debt ceiling is raised, it would force the U.S. to con-template where its values lie.“If we blow past our credit limit and keeping on spend-ing, in the short run, income is generated, but in the long run, the debt can’t be paid,” Spell-man said. “It’s a sanity check to get us to understand the ef-fect of short-term benefits of spending versus the long-term implications of having debt and to start thinking serious about these implications.”heavily on his benefits to afford an education at his “dream school” and to travel back home to his family ev-ery other weekend.“The benefit I get usually covers the housing I receive,” Penuelaz said. “I use that money to pay for all the bills of the house. If I don’t get that check, my family is in trouble because we use my housing allowance to pay for a majority of the bills.”Out of the 2,000 people receiving benefits on cam-pus, only 809 are veterans. The rest are surviving chil-dren, wives or husbands of wartime veterans.Jeremiah Gunderson, co-ordinator of Student Veter-an Services, said the impact is noticeable in his office. Even Gunderson will be af-fected directly by the shut-down because he receives veteran disability benefits every month.About 3.8 million wound-ed U.S. veterans could po-tentially not receive disabil-ity checks, which they get based on mental and physi-cal wounds from combat.“Their future is kind of in the hands of a bunch of people who seem a million miles away, and they don’t have any say in it,” Gunder-son said. “We’ll just have to wait and see.”UNIVERSITYMarshall Nolen / Daily Texan StaffStudent Government president Horacio Villarreal speaks at the Student Government Assembly meeting Tuesday evening. At the Student Govern-ment Assembly meeting Tuesday, a resolution to be filed at the next meeting was announced that calls for the elimination of government stipends given to all execu-tive branch members. The SG budget outlines a tuition allotment for the president and vice president of $5,200 each, as well as a govern-ment stipend of $6,840 each. It also details a $3,420 stipend for each of the other five executive branch members. According to Andrew Houston, architecture and urban studies senior and chair of the rules and regula-tion committee, the funds for the stipend take up about 36 percent of SG’s entire budget.John Brown, government sophomore and one author of the resolution, said he thinks the stipends are unnecessary.“I’m not out to get any-body, I’m just trying to equalize the playing field,” Brown said. Houston said similar resolutions in the past were unsuccessful, but this reso-lution has a good chance of succeeding because of SG’s emphasis on its role as an educational opportunity for all students.“There are also people within the assembly, almost every year, who intend on trying to run or becoming part of the executive branch in the future, so they kill [the resolution] so that they don’t ruin the opportunity for themselves,” Houston said.Brown said the resolution currently has no sponsors, but he hopes to see more ac-tive involvement from the members of the assembly.Proposed resolution may cut SG stipends  By Madlin Mekelburg@madlinbmekDEBTcontinues from page 1SHUTDOWNcontinues from page 1Favoritism, as opposed to discrimination, contrib-utes to a greater level of inequity within a school or workplace, according to a study co-authored by eco-nomics professor Daniel Hamermesh.Maastricht University economists Jan Feld and Nicolas Salamanca also co-authored the research, which was released on Oct. 7. Favoritism is a display of a significantly positive response toward those of similar characteristics to oneself, while discrimina-tion is a display of harmful treatment toward those of dissimilar characteristics. The study focused on an experiment in which the researchers issued an exam to a large number of stu-dents at Maastricht Uni-versity. The researchers asked a randomly selected group of students to put their names on the exam, which allowed the grad-ers to infer nationality and gender, Hamermesh said. They asked the rest to only put ID numbers.

Although broken exit signs cost $75 to fix, Voyles said the cost of repair is secondary to the potential safety risks at hand.“Damaged exit signs are immediately reported to UTPD and maintenance,” Voyles said. “These inci-dents are a primary concern for us because exit signs are life and safety equip-ment. They’re designed to make sure our students can safely exit the building during emergencies.”Although an offensive sketch or subversive mes-sage is not life-threaten-ing, removing graffiti is a source of frustration for Facilities employees. Graffiti wipes and pres-sure washers are effective on smooth walls around cam-pus, Woerndell said. If statues are vandalized, the process is more difficult. Woerndell’s team once spent an entire day cleaning the Martin Luther King Jr. statue with soap and water because bronze statues can be damaged by chemical-ly-treated cleaning products.“If the wall is tagged pretty hard and the paint is soaked up real good, then Construction will come over and sandblast it,” Woerndell said.Lentz said Custodial Ser-vices cleans indoor graffiti, primarily in restrooms, that can be removed with stan-dard cleaning products.Sally Moore, associate di-rector for Custodial Services, said custodians try to elimi-nate graffiti immediately.“Experience has proven that any amount of graffiti attracts more graffiti, so our practice is to remove graf-fiti as soon as it’s noticed,” Moore said. “We also have surface coating products that make it difficult to write on the surface.”VANDALISMcontinues from page 1RESEARCH HEALTHFavoritism, as opposed to discrimination, contrib-utes to a greater level of inequity within a school or workplace, according to a study co-authored by eco-nomics professor Daniel Hamermesh.Maastricht University economists Jan Feld and Nicolas Salamanca also co-authored the research, which was released on Oct. 7. Favoritism is a display of a significantly positive response toward those of similar characteristics to oneself, while discrimina-tion is a display of harmful treatment toward those of dissimilar characteristics. The study focused on an experiment in which the researchers issued an exam to a large number of stu-dents at Maastricht Uni-versity. The researchers asked a randomly selected group of students to put their names on the exam, which allowed the grad-ers to infer nationality and gender, Hamermesh said. They asked the rest to only put ID numbers. The three researchers then investi-gated four groups of test takers: gender matched be-tween students and grad-ers, gender unmatched, na-tionality matched between students and graders and nationality unmatched.The findings indicated that the groups of students matched with graders by nationality received sig-nificantly better grades than those who were unmatched. Hamermesh said he be-lieves there should be a sys-tem in place at UT that en-sures tests on campus do not expose the names of students.“In classes where graders can see who the students are, the chance for unfairness is much greater,” Hamermesh said. “I would argue that all tests at our university should be blind. If the majority is fa-vored, we need to tell them they are no different than the minority, and we need to tell employers to stop favoring the majority.” The results of the ex-periment indicated gender, whether matched or un-matched, did not make a dif-ference in the grades issued to the students. Addition-ally, unmatched nationalities did not affect the grades of the students. Business honors fresh-man Katie Stephens said she is interested in the atypical focus of the study toward favoritism.“Favoritism does not possess the same nega-tive social stigma as does discrimination,” Stephens said. “Therefore, it is often overlooked by those not ex-periencing the harmful side effects or those in a higher position with the ability to prevent it.”The researchers said not enough study has been de-voted to the outcome of fa-voritism as opposed to dis-crimination. They further proposed that the inequity displayed within the grad-ing system of school set-tings will also exist in the labor market. Human development freshman Neil Doughty said he was not aware of the ef-fect of favoritism in a grad-ing situation and appreciates the information put forward by the research.“Honestly, the results [of the study] surprise me,” Doughty said. “I would have assumed the opposite. As a student, I don’t want to be evaluated on a different scale than other students, and research like this helps work to fight that issue from arising.”Jarrid Denman / Daily Texan StaffEconomics professor Daniel Hamermesh co-authored a research study detailing the effects of favoritism in school and the workplace. By Christina Breitbeil@christinabreitStudy finds flaws of favoritismEarly puberty leads to risk-takingResearch revealed that adolescents who go through puberty at an earlier age may be more likely to ex-periment with substance abuse because of their de-sire to resemble older peers. Jessica Duncan Cance, as-sistant professor in the de-partment of kinesiology and health education, was the lead author on the study and was responsible for developing the research questions, analyz-ing the data and writing up the findings. The study, “Per-ceived Pubertal Timing and Recent Substance Use Among Adolescents: A Longitudinal Perspective,” found that early advancement of puberty is correlated with greater ex-perimentation with cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana. Cance conducted her re-search with colleagues from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.“Our findings suggest that adolescents who perceive themselves as developing earlier than their peers have a heightened risk for engag-ing in substance use, thus adding to the ever-growing profile of factors that influ-ence risky behavior during this stage,” said Anna Talley, graduate research assistant for the project.According to Cance, the study confirms what other research has found, but also investigates a new aspect of the issue.“Our study [is] unique because we were able to show that this risk persisted throughout adolescence, even after their same-aged peers caught up in their pubertal development,” Cance said.The study suggests that preventing substance use among early developers in late elementary school or early middle school could make a long-term difference. Talley said while this study explores patterns of substance abuse across ado-lescence, the results may be interesting to students whose personal lives or fu-ture careers necessitate an understanding of the com-plexities of adolescent de-velopment and behavior.“It is hoped that individu-als who take concern with the well-being of adolescents — whether it’s that of a younger sibling or an entire class of middle school students — will consider the role of pu-bertal timing as they strive to steer youth away from adopt-ing unhealthy behaviors,” Talley said.By Cinnamon Cornell@CinnamonCornellDebby Garcia / Daily Texan StaffJessica Duncan Cance of the department of kinesiology is currently studying the relationship between substance use and pubertal development.For two years running, UT-Austin has landed among the top 10 schools for gradu-ate entrepreneurship programs, as listed by both the Princeton Review and Entrepreneur Magazine. The 2014 rankings, which came out in mid-September, credit programs like Texas Venture Labs and the Kelleher Center for Entrepreneurship for the achievement. However, the undergraduate program on-campus was left off the top-25 list for what is at least the second year in a row.How does a world-class university, with 40,000 undergraduates, located in Austin, Texas, a hub of entrepreneurial activity, re-main off any leaderboard of entrepreneurial education? Dr. John Sibley Butler, director of the Herb Kelleher Center for Entrepreneur-ship, told the Texan that the lack of entre-preneurial courses and innovative resources for undergraduates makes the difference between UT’s entrepreneurship programs being ranked or un-ranked.Adding courses and opening startup in-cubators would institutionalize the hard work that has been done to grow student entrepreneurship by faculty such as Butler, Professor of Innovation Bob Metcalfe and former UT-Austin President William Cun-ningham. The problem is, these improve-ments won’t come until the student body demands them.The Princeton Review took many factors into account to derive the rankings, including the proportion of the university community actively and successfully involved in entre-preneurial endeavors, the number of scholar-ships available for student entrepreneurs, the number and size of grants for entrepreneurial projects and school support for business plan competitions.And there are Texas schools that ranked in the top-25 for entrepreneurship un-dergraduate programs, including the University of Houston, which came in at number two, and Texas Christian Uni-versity, which came in at number 22. Our good friends in Norman, OK, are also ranked — at number six.Admittedly, administrators at UT-Aus-tin don’t necessarily have the resources to implement the programs that would make UT-Austin the top school for entrepreneur-ship. Student entrepreneurs, moreover, may be too focused on the immediate business of starting a company to focus on putting in place long-term entrepreneurship-support-ing infrastructure at UT. Given all that, how should we push for better support for entrepreneurs?  We need to support student entrepreneurs like fans support players on their favorite teams. Students who do so exist and are colloqui-ally referred to in the startup community as “founderati.” Founderati are big fans of startups, and I’m a big founderati myself. Last year, I served as the Founding Director of the Longhorn Entrepreneurship Agency, an agency of Student Government.  By defi-nition, the agency is a group of founderati serving student entrepreneurs. Its volun-teers have worked hours each semester with the UT administration and entrepre-neurial organizations to produce resources for student entrepreneurs. But the agency is just a start.Despite the disheartening fact that students can evidently start companies better at OU than UT-Austin, our school has the ingredients to be the best college for entrepreneurs in America. Forbes contributor Patrick Hull recently cited Austin as one of ten up and coming cit-ies for entrepreneurs. Hull’s reasoning? The buzzing startup community, influx of young professionals and creativity-driving events like SXSW that populate the city. And in the middle of Austin, on the 40 Acres, students enjoy the opportu-nity to work with world-class faculty in any field they choose. So next year, let’s aim to make it to the top 25 — if not the number one slot. 4A OPINIONLEGALESE | Opinions expressed in The Daily Texan are those of the editor, the Editorial Board or the writer of the article.

It means that U.S. federal law says that there is an upper limit to the government’s debt beyond which the government has to stop borrowing. If the government can no longer borrow, it will not be able to pay off its obligations, and the bonds and notes the government issues will go into default.Yes — the U.S. has already reached its current debt limit. The U.S. reached the current debt limit of $16.699 trillion this past May, but has had sufficient funds to continue to pay its bills. But according to the Obama administration, if the debt ceiling is not raised, and thus the U.S. government cannot borrow more funds, the government will run out of money on Oct. 17. At this point, it will no longer be able to pay it for its outlays, triggering a default.How did the debt ceiling come about? Sur-prisingly, there is nothing about a debt ceiling in the Constitution. Rather, Congress and the President created it in 1917 with the passing of the Second Liberty Act. Since then, Con-gress has been continually raising the ceil-ing. In fact, it has done so 74 times in the last 51 years, according to the Congressional Research Service, making the ceiling almost arbitrary. But this year, a standoff in Congress has changed the situation. Congressional leaders have been using the threat of a gov-ernment default as a bargaining tool.But if it’s not in the Constitution, why on earth does the debt ceiling exist?In the words of Dr. Daniel Hamermesh, the Sue Killam Professor in the Foundation of Economics at the University of Texas at Austin, “The debt ceiling is a self-inflicted wound that the legislature and the president tied their hands with. No other country does this... It has become a bargaining tool, al-though in a better world, we shouldn’t have this.”So this year, what exactly is being bar-gained for or against? And why hasn’t Con-gress raised the ceiling already?At the most basic level, the fight this year is over the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, a health care platform that House Republicans have tried to repeal or undermine at least 42 times, according to CNN. Now, members of the Tea Party, or right-wing Republicans, have decided to use the threat of a looming default to try to defund the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. This is no secret agenda. In fact, one of the most vocal advocates of this strategy, Senator Ted Cruz, is a junior U.S. Senator from Texas.What’s at stake? What happens if the U.S. defaults on its debt?Honestly, no one knows. A U.S. default is unprecedented. While other countries — such as Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Belize — have found themselves in sovereign default, none of these nations’ currencies serve as the world’s benchmark currency the way the U.S. dollar does. Usually, during eco-nomic turmoil, investors buy what they U.S. Treasury bonds, seeing them as one of the safest investments. In this scenario, when the U.S. government’s sovereignty itself is at risk, it’s unclear what the global investment com-munity will do.Will investors continue to buy U.S. bonds? Will they move to a portfolio of currencies? One person’s guess is as good as any other’s. In either situation, though, the confidence of the people buying U.S. debt — individuals, institutional investors, large banks, and for-eign governments such as China and Japan — will be shattered. And this diminishing confi-dence level will be the most detrimental effect of the default, much larger than the practical considerations of the government not being able to pay its bills.Hamermesh agreed, saying that this crisis is slowly destroying the perception of the U.S. as the most stable place to put money. Inter-est rates will go up as well, and the increased uncertainty will cause investors to move their money out of the country.As for the effects on UT, they would trickle down effect would harm funding. In truth though, if such a thing did occur, the big picture implication would be so catastrophic that it’s even hard to speculate specific effects on UT. And the longer this fight goes on in Congress, the more detrimental the effects will be.Recently, there have been a number of sto-ries in the media about an avenue President Obama could take to sidestep the Congress and resolve this crisis. Section four of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. constitution says the following: “The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrec-tion or rebellion, shall not be questioned.”To Hamermesh’s eyes, this passage pro-vides the grounds for Obama telling Con-gress, “the debt should not be questioned, I’m not going to let it be questioned. Therefore we are going to keep on writing checks.” A move that would in effect “leave Ted Cruz stomping up and down and crying.” Other academics are not so certain that the solution is clear. Dr. Jack M Balkin, the Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment at Yale Law School, says on his blog that “the President does not have the unilateral power under Section four to disregard the debt ceiling.” Balkin believes that the President needs Congressional authorization to do so. If he sidesteps the Congress, it’s likely he could be tried for impeachment. The Obama adminis-tration has also officially stated that the Presi-dent does not have the power to end the crisis under the 14th Amendment.So where does this leave us?Our country is on the brink of unprece-dented economic collapse in large part due to partisan politics. And yet, behind all the bickering, there is a vague certainty that the U.S. cannot default; that the government won’t. This sentiment seems reminiscent of the one held by numerous large institutions during the mortgage crisis years ago. But the truth is, no country is too big to fail, not even the world’s largest superpower. And we, as a country, need to realize this in order to uphold our esteemed status in the global community.Should we as students at UT care? In the words of Dr. Hamermesh, if we are citizens of the U.S., and if we want to continue to live in a country that is viewed as the best in the world, we should certainty care. And one of the first steps to caring is to educate ourselves on what’s going on.Malik is a Plan II and business honors sophomore from Austin.By Amil MalikDaily Texan ColumnistU.S. default: Why we should careCOLUMNGALLERYLauren Moore / Daily Texan Staff Court should reject polluters’ suitAt a meeting of the Tarrant County Tea Party on Monday night, Lt. Gov David Dewhurst called for the impeachment of President Barack Obama, a statement that was greeted with cheers from the crowd. Dewhurst explained to the Texas Observer that he believed Obama should be impeached for doing “things which are not authorized under federal law, such as with immigration, such as not following our federal drug laws.” We’re sure this all enthralling to the members of the Tarrant County Tea Party, but is it a valuable discussion to have in the context of the race for Lt. Gov, in which Dewhurst is currently running? We don’t think so. Horns Down for putting political distraction tactics above actual policy conversations.A UT / Texas Tribune poll released Oct. 14 found that more than half of polled Texans support the $2 billion water funding proposition that will be up for statewide vote on Nov. 5. Only 19 percent oppose the proposition, so although 24 percent remain undecided, it’s difficult to imagine most of Texas changing its mind in less than a month.HORNS DOWN:  AN IMMIGRATION RORSCHACH TESTTexas county jails reported this month that they spent more than $150 million on the incarceration of over 130,000 undocumented immigrants over the past two years. Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, who wrote the bill requiring the jails to regularly report the statistic, said the number showed that the government should do more to secure the border. We believe the huge expense instead shows the need for comprehensive immigration reform that would make legal immigration more accessible. Either way, the number only tells us something we all al-ready know: Illegal immigration continues to be a problem for Texas. Both sides of the issue still disagree just as much on the best way to reduce it.Only yesterday, we wrote an editorial con-cerning the abysmal job the Texas state gov-ernment has done of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the editorial, which argued that Texas should be held accountable for its inad-equate regulation of pollution, we mentioned that the chief offender — the Texas Commis-sion on Environmental Quality — wanted the question of whether it was required to com-ply with national emissions regulations to be decided in a higher court.It seems they’ll get their wish.On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court an-nounced that it would hear Texas’ challenge to federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Texas, along with Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina and the American Petroleum Institute, claims that the Clean Air Act covers only toxic air pollutants and does not grant the Environmental Pro-tection Agency the authority to penalize the emission of gases that contribute to the dan-gerous warming of the atmosphere.The Court declined to hear several of the states’ other appeals, which will allow the EPA to continue regulating emissions from motor vehicles and certifies the EPA’s assess-ment of greenhouse gases as a public health risk — invalidating the plaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary. The question they did choose to debate is whether the EPA’s authority to regulate motor vehicles also extends to sta-tionary sources of greenhouse gases, like power plants and oil refineries.We’re not qualified enough to sift through the legal nuances of the Clean Air Act and de-termine the limits of federal jurisdiction. But we do know that if the federal government is not able to regulate the massive amounts of greenhouse gases pumped into Texas skies, our state certainly won’t do so itself. The Texas government has consistently shown support for big business rather than the environment — Texas leads the nation in greenhouse gas emissions,  producing more than the next two states combined — and cannot be trusted to responsibly restrain major polluters from wan-tonly damaging our planet.Hopefully, the Court will recognize the danger of letting Texas’ pollution continue unabated and allow the federal government to intervene.CLASS 5CLASSIFIEDSADVERTISING TERMS There are no refunds or credits.

Really, the cards tell a universal story, that when arranged in a specific way for a specific person cast an illuminating light on their possible choices.”Polacheck uses one of the most commonly used decks, known as the Rider-Waite deck. The deck has 78 cards depicting the major and mi-nor arcana. Major arcana represent major life events or long-term issues. Minor arcana represent everyday ups and downs. The cards are symbols and archetypes, which change in meaning when applied to someone’s life.“It’s going to be a lot more ac-curate and a lot more detailed of a reading than saying, ‘That looks like a dog in your teacup, shaped out of tea leaves,’” Pola-check said.Working in the divination business means encounter-ing the occasional skeptic, but these tarot readers do not feel intimidated.“Skepticism doesn’t bother me,” Pepper said. “In fact, I be-lieve it is essential to being a hu-man being.”Polacheck is convinced that her ability to make a living is dependent on open-minded communities such as Austin.“The reality is that if I wanted to live in a small town in Texas, I would be run out of town on a rail,” Polacheck said. “I could not do what I do for a living, which is really helping people, without probably suffering a lot of persecution.”This fear of the occult and divination is due in part to a mistrust of tarot readers and psychics just looking to make a buck, according to Polacheck. Megan Lane, a tarot reader who recently moved from Aus-tin to Burbank, Calif., said it is the popular representation of tarot readers and divinators that makes this career difficult.“It’s dealing with the rep-utation of psychics being gypsies or being fakes and taking advantage of people,” Lane said. “The ones who are very good have to deal with the reputation of ones who aren’t.”Polacheck worked in New Orleans up until Hurricane Katrina. After witnessing the destruction, she decided it was time to return to her native Austin. Little by little, Pola-check began reading again in 2011 and has not stopped since. “If you told me as a little kid that I’d be doing this as an adult, making my living and doing this full time, I would not believe you,” Polacheck said. “It’s incredibly humbling for me, that people are willing to be present with me and be so vulnerable with me. It’s mind-blowing work.” What started as a tradi-tion passed from mother to daughter has developed into Polacheck’s passion. Those who wander over to her little vintage trailer in East Austin will leave mes-merized and more in tune with their universe, thanks to Polacheck and her tarot deck.successfully kidnap-ping fairy tale master race candidate Henry Mills and psychologi-cally breaking down “Once’s” normally stal-wart main protagonist, Emma Swan. English actor Rob-bie Kay has effectively conquered the diffi-cult task of infusing this classic character with an unexpected sense of malice and intrigue in the short span of three epi-sodes. The prospect of seeing his already robust performance unfold over the com-ing weeks is exciting. Pan is a nice fit in the shoes of a villain. Although his portrayal is vastly more sinister than his animated Dis-ney counterpart, he still has the mischie-vous spirit that makes the character so en-dearing. “Once Upon a Time” continues to flourish in a modern storytelling age where the line between he-roes and villains is so thin, forever changing the perspective on two of fantasy’s most icon-ic characters.“Once Upon a Time” airs Sunday at 7 p.m. on ABC.

DT: You have a strict no-phone policy you started at shows. What was the inspiration behind put-ting those signs up? JB: It’s more just some kind of guidance. It’s almost like when you go to an old school theater and things like that. It’s all about trying to set the right mood or right atmosphere so that the music can be presented in its right environment. As an audi-ence, we felt that we don’t re-ally enjoy seeing a show and having people around us with screens everywhere. GT: Yeah, it should be about direct contact between the audience and the performers.DT: Last time you were in Austin you were at South By Southwest, and you played a lot of shows. I was at the Spin one. At that show, right before you started “Husbands,” you said, “This is our last song and our last show at this fucking horrible festival.”JB: Did I say that?GT: Probably.DT: Well, honestly, did you like SXSW or was it just too many shows?GT: We didn’t enjoy it at all.JB: It’s hard. We did our best, though. I think the audience was great, and we did a good show, to make the best out of it each time and give a good performance. It was so short anyway. It was like 20 minutes. It’s under the sun, and you’re playing next to a beer ad. It’s not very glamorous.DT: In an interview with Pitchfork, you mentioned how you were having issues with sound guys, having to fight to be taken seriously more. Is that an issue you still face?JB: Originally, we didn’t think that we would have to prove ourselves even more. Being four women in a band, for example, wasn’t an agenda for us. It just happened. I think we start-ed slowly to realize that it makes some differences for some people, and some preconceptions. It wasn’t necessarily bad because you can play with these things. Even on stage, you can play with people’s prejudices, which is quite interesting.BANDcontinues from page 8Pu Ying Huang / Daily Texan Staff Jehnny Beth of Savages performs at the Honda Stage during weekend one of ACL.  6 SPORTSutrecsports.orgENTER NOWINTRAMURAL BASKETBALLTEAMWORKSTARTS HERESIDELINEFOOTBALLLonghorns eye Big 12 titleBefore Saturday, the last time Texas beat Oklahoma no one knew what an iPad was and flip phones were still going strong. But most Long-horn fans remember Texas being one Colt McCoy injury away from their second na-tional title in four years.To the surprise of most, Texas, a 13.5-point under-dog, dominated the Soon-ers this past Saturday at the Cotton Bowl. The Longhorns upset 12th-ranked Oklaho-ma 36-20, their first win over the border-state rival since 2009. Now, with half its sea-son left, Texas is anxious to reach what could potentially come next. “You can study the history of Texas and when we win this game our season tends to go where we want,” senior quarterback Case McCoy said. “When we don’t win, you can see how it has gone the last couple of years. I am excited about where this team is headed after this game.”Before the season started, head coach Mack Brown talked up his team and prom-ised Texas would get back to national championship con-tention. But talk halted when the Longhorns lost back-to-back non-conference games against Brigham Young Uni-versity and Ole Miss. After those losses, the Longhorns’ only hope of survival was a conference title. Following a win over Kan-sas State — their first victory against the Wildcats since 2003 — and a narrow escape against Iowa State, Texas turned to Oklahoma, a game that’s always the biggest ob-stacle of the season. “I think [the games] are all important but especially this game, the Oklahoma game,” co-offensive coordi-nator Major Applewhite said. “We understand that things can flow either way each and every week. I think [the win against OU] was every bit as important for Coach Brown as it was for me, as it was for the equipment manager, as it was for [sophomore running back] Johnathan Gray.”The win against a highly ranked team is great, but the Longhorns’ biggest achievement may be the confidence gained. “We proved to not only ev-eryone else, but also to our-selves that we can play with the best of them,” McCoy said.Texas triumphed at the Cotton Bowl, but the group still believes there is room to improve. “[The OU game] certainly shows where we can go,” se-nior defensive end Jackson Jeffcoat said. “We can defi-nitely get better than that. We still made mistakes that we are going to go back and look at. You always have to do that. You can’t always be satisfied because you got the win.”Texas sits atop the Big 12 at 3-0 alongside Texas Tech, who is also undefeated in conference play. But the schedule doesn’t get easier for the Longhorns. A road game against TCU in two weeks will test if Texas can make its effort at Fair Park consistent. “[We need] to build on it,” senior offensive guard Mason Walters said. “Because two weeks from now we will play a good TCU team. Thank-fully we have the bye week to get everyone to stop patting us on the back and get ready to go play TCU. But that’s the focus of next week. What do we need to do to go to 4-0 in the conference?”Charlie Pearce / Daily Texan StaffLonghorn tight end Greg Daniels celebrates his first Red River Rivalry victory after defeating OU Saturday. Texas is now one of only three Big 12 teams that remain undefeated in conference play. If the Longhorns can stay hot and win the Big 12 this year, they will play in their first BCS bowl since 2005.1. Texas (12-2, 5-0 Big 12No. 3 Texas is far and away the best team in the confer-ence. The outsides of Texas are the most dominant hit-ters in the conference, while other Big 12 teams struggle to get kills. Texas should run the table in the country’s weakest major conference, especially after losing just one player from last year’s Big 12 championship squad.2. Kansas (14-4, 4-1) The Jayhawks are the only other Big 12 team to break the ACVA Coaches poll, coming in at No. 23. After losing to Central Arkansas, Arkansas and Creighton early in the season, the Jay-hawks won their first four conference games before fall-ing to Texas. The bright spot for Kansas is junior outside Sara McClinton, who is aver-aging a conference best 4.53 kills per set.3. Oklahoma (15-4, 3-2)The Sooners’ two losses in conference have come at the hands of the two teams above them. Despite being 15-4 overall, the Sooners have had little competition, with their signature wins coming against Iowa State and Kan-sas State. With the help of senior middle blocker Sallie McLaurin’s league best .415 hitting percentage, the Soon-ers are the third most offen-sively efficient Big 12 team.4. Iowa State (10-5, 4-1) The Cyclones feasted on the bottom half of the conference early in the season en route to its four conference wins. But just a 6-4 out-of-conference record against not-so-great competition shows that the Cyclones aren’t as good as last year. They are also last in team blocks, which spells trouble for their next games against the two best hitting teams in Texas and Kansas.5. Baylor (9-11, 1-3)Their play isn’t as bad as their record. After dropping six of their first eight, the Bears righted the ship, but they are a middle of the pack team in nearly every category. But with two games left against Texas Tech, TCU and Kansas State, the Bears can rebound.6. TCU (12-7, 1-4) This is where the conference gets very weak and crowded. TCU stands out as the best of the worst, though. A good non-conference record helped them out along with an aver-age offensive attack. But the league-worst defense holds them back and will prevent them from pulling any upsets.7. West Virginia (15-4, 2-3)Don’t let their record trick you. They failed to play a single BCS conference school in non-conference and still managed to drop a match to Duquesne. They improved from last year, though, when they went 0-16 in conference. They have been lucky so far with teams hitting a conference worst .152 against them. Eventually the luck will run out and they will move back down to the cellar of the conference.8. Kansas State (13-5, 1-4) Another team with a good record because of a weak non-conference schedule. But when they hit conference play, they were shocked by the Mountaineers. The Wildcats took a giant step back from last year with the loss of their All-Big 12 setter Caitlyn Donahue. The Wildcats are currently last in the league in assists.9. Texas Tech (8-12, 1-4)The Red Raiders have a tough time above the net. They can’t kill a ball, rank-ing last in the conference. They also struggle with the block, averaging under two a set. Their biggest strength is their scrappiness, but it’s not enough to make up for their struggles at the net.The 40th annual Betsy Rawls Invitational ended Tues-day with Texas in 13th place. UCLA, ranked No. 1 coming into the tournament, finished on top, ten strokes ahead of the closest competition. Freshman Allison Lee from UCLA won first place overall with a total score of 12-under-par 204.Texas sophomore Natalie Karcher continued her suc-cess with a third round score of 1-over-par 73 and ended the event tied for 27th place, tops on the team. After a rough first two days, junior Bertine Strauss had the best third round for Texas, shooting a 1-under-par 71, but still ended the tourna-ment fourth best on the team with a 69th place finish.Sophomore Tezira Abe and freshman Julia Beck improved Tuesday as well, shooting 2-over-par 74 and 1-over-par 73, respectively, while freshman Anne Hakula struggled with a score of 79. “I think we are seeing some good stuff from our young players, which is what I thought would happen,” said Texas head coach Martha Richards. “We’re growing and getting better. I think as the spring goes on, we’re just go-ing to keep getting better.” By Garrett Callahan@garrettcallahanVOLLEYBALLTexas sits atop Big 12 Power RankingsCharlie Pearce / Daily Texan Staff Freshman Chiaka Ogbogu has played an important role in the Longhorns’ early season suc-cess.

Murray ex-ited in the second quarter with an MCL sprain in his left knee.Their health is likely to go a long way toward determining whether the Cowboys end a three-year playoff drought.It won’t help that the first game after the inju-ries is Sunday in Phila-delphia. The Cowboys and Eagles are tied for the NFC East lead at 3-3.The update from coach Jason Garrett was the same as it is every week with every player — Ware and Murray will be evalu-ated daily, and there is no timetable.Ware has played through injuries before — mostly in-volving his neck — which is why he has appeared in all 134 games with 133 starts as he approaches the halfway point of his ninth season.

In the case of Peter Pan, creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz are taking a very brave step. We all know Pan, that ver-dant forever young adven-turer who flies through the clouds with the powers of faith, hope, trust and a bit of pixie dust. This season, the creators ask if we really know him.Season two brought new characters into the fold, and chief among them was Nev-erland’s number one das-tardly cad, Captain Hook. This Hook is no stereotypical handlebar-mustachioed cod-fish with the red overcoat and feathered hat. “Once Upon a Time’s” Hook is a stud. With his movie star good looks, irresistible charm and guy-liner rivaling that of Captain Jack Sparrow, Hook is the complete antithesis of what the audience has been brought up to expect. The legendary pirate is introduced as a lost soul consumed by his desire for revenge against Rumples-tiltskin, the metaphorical crocodile who robbed Hook of his one true love and his hand. But Hook soon learns revenge is not as ca-thartic as he expected, giv-ing him a sympathetic edge uncharacteristic of such a legendary villain. Hook is brought to life by Irish actor Colin O’Donoghue with a performance that exudes cool confidence and cocky bravado, breathing new life into what could have been just another Disney pirate. But wait, why in the name of William Smee are view-ers pulling for the bad guy? Where is Pan in all of this?Because the ownership of J.M. Barrie’s classic tale is legally complicated, operating on a thin line between public domain and actual ownership in several countries, Kitsis and Horowitz were forced to delay the introduction of these characters until later in the series. Pan’s delayed appearance until season three actually cre-ated a serendipitous turn of events that led to the pro-duction of one of the most fascinating story arcs of the television season. Pan is not the hero. In truth, he’s terrifying. With one fell swoop, Kitsis and Horowitz transformed the heroic Pan into the most dia-bolical foe our heroes have ever faced. In just three epi-sodes, he has already prov-en to be a deft adversary, The oldest film festival in Austin may not be the one Austinites are most familiar with. Polari, an Austin non-profit, is best known for its annual film festival, formerly the Austin Gay and Lesbian International Film Festival. Though the event was re-branded in 2012 for the 25th anniversary, this year’s festi-val continues to bring hun-dreds of narrative, documen-tary and avant-garde films about LGBTQ issues to Aus-tin from around the world. Throughout the year, Polari facilitates educa-tional programs such as the Queer Youth Media Project, which provides resources for LGBTQ youth to make short films. Curran Nault, artistic di-rector for the Polari Film Festival, received a doctor-ate in radio-television-film from the University of Texas. Though he didn’t program the original festival, he knows the story well.“1987, it’s a time when there’s not much LGBTQ representation on televi-sion or in film, so the start of the festival at that time was really kind of a big deal,” Nault said. The creator of the original festival, Scott Dinger, wanted an outlet for the LGBTQ films being made at the time, according to Nault. “It started to grow each year after that until it became a two-week festival sometime in the early nineties,” Nault said. Dinger’s original idea is now the oldest film festi-val in Austin, a city some-times called the third coast for its growing filmmaking community. Though LG-BTQ issues are more openly discussed, many involved feel their job is not done because there are still holes in the mainstream media conversation. “For example, gay marriage is a really popular topic right now, you see that in the news,” Nault said. “But then, we tell other stories that maybe people don’t get a chance to see.”  PJ Raval, an Austinite and featured artist in this year’s festival, found a topic he believes is missing from the discussion. Raval researched whether or not members of the LGBTQ community faced their own challenges when it came to aging in his film “Before You Know It.”“What I discovered is that they do,” Raval said. “Many of them struggle with isola-tion — they are twice as like-ly to be alone in their senior years as opposed to hetero-sexual counterparts.”   Raval discovered that the isolation comes from growing up in a more conservative time. “It’s really amazing that these LGBTQ seniors have lived through what’s now being called the ‘gay civil rights movement,’” Raval said. “I think that they’re largely unrecognized.”Yen Tan, Austinite and director of the fea-ture film “Pit Stop,” said the festival has helped bring the Austin community together.  “The fusion of the gay com-munity and straight commu-nity, the line is not as obvi-ous,” Tan said. “You see a lot of inter-mingling between these people and I feel like that’s the way it should be.”  Nault hopes Polari will serve this same purpose for years to come.  “I think of the film festi-val as a space that poten-tially everybody can come and be together and en-joy a film in a dark room,” Nault said. “So it’s about uniting community.” Savages, a post-punk quartet from London, is known for its live shows and has been making waves and racking up award nomina-tions for its mesmerizing debut Silence Yourself. The Daily Texan talked with singer Jehnny Beth and guitarist Gemma Thomp-son about their influences, their no-cell-phone policy at shows, and why they hate South By Southwest. The Daily Texan: With Silence Yourself coming out this year and a huge world tour, what has been your fa-vorite part of the year so far?Gemma Thompson: It’s quite nice meeting different people along the way, espe-cially after the shows. Jehnny Beth: I think it’s been good too, to as you say, “tour the world” and then meet a lot of musicians that have got into our record.
