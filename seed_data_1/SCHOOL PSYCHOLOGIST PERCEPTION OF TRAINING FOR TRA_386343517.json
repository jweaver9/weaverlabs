The quality of graduate training was also examined through a compilation of syllabi. The participant s (N = 193) completed a questionnaire regarding their confidence in working with this population, their perceptions of what contributed to their competency, and information about their graduate programs. The resulting sample of respondents came from all geographic regions in the United States, 91% of whom were currently working in a school setting. A series of regressions found that graduate training accounted for significant variance in respondents’ confidence in working with transgender youth, despite a majority of respondents reporting that they received no graduate training on the subject suggesting that those who did receive training found it valuable. This perception of graduate training contributing to respondents’ competence appears to be mediated by graduation year suggesting that programs are increasing their training efforts over time. Syllabi from identified courses of graduate programs across the United States were coded on a number of factors including number of readings assigned, number of course topics covering transgender content, and course type (e.g., multicultural). Each identified assigned reading was read for pre-identified content to    gain an understanding of the breadth and depth of content covered within the course. Significant relationships were found between breadth of content covered and the amount of reading assignments or course topics related to transgender content a course offered. There were significant differences across all three factors when comparing multicultural courses with other types of courses. Few significant differences were found in comparisons made based on a number of programmatic and respondent differences including level of degree obtained, religious affiliation, environment, region, and graduation year. Recommendations for enhancing training relevant to transgender youth are presented.                           ii TABLE OF CONTENTS LIST OF TABLES ............................................................................................................. iv Introduction ......................................................................................................................... 1 Statement of the Problem .................................................................................................... 1 Literature Review ................................................................................................................ 5 Transgender Youth in Schools ............................................................................................ 5 Risks and Struggles of Transgender and other Gender Diverse students ........................... 6 The Role of School Psychologists and Training Programs ................................................. 8 Methods ............................................................................................................................. 11 Design and Procedure ....................................................................................................... 11 Measures. .......................................................................................................................... 13 Goal of the Present Study .................................................................................................. 13 Research Questions ........................................................................................................... 14 Results ............................................................................................................................... 15 Demographics ................................................................................................................... 15 Research Question One ..................................................................................................... 15 Research Question Two .................................................................................................... 18 Research Questions Three ................................................................................................. 21 Research Question Four .................................................................................................... 22 Discussion ......................................................................................................................... 25    iii Limitations and Future Directions .................................................................................... 29 Implications for School Psychology ................................................................................. 33 Appendix A ....................................................................................................................... 36 Appendix B ....................................................................................................................... 37 Appendix C ....................................................................................................................... 41 References ......................................................................................................................... 42           iv LIST OF TABLES Table 1.

Transgender, genderqueer, gender non-conforming and other gender minority students are often marginalized while in school (Kosciw et al., 2014). These students are targets of intolerance and bullying from students and staff alike. For example, 59 percent of transgender identifying students report being the victim of verbal harassment and 25 percent of transgender students are the recipients of physical aggression resulting from their gender expression (Kosciw et al., 2014).  Additionally, due to low levels of awareness of and education on transgender issues, these students report feelings of conflict and distress surrounding peer and staff misconceptions about their identity (McGuire, Anderson, Toomy, & Russel, 2010; Cashore & Tuason, 2009). Misinformation and hostility from both students and school staff appear to cause significant academic and social-emotional hardships for transgender students. Nearly half of transgender students report regularly skipping school because of safety concerns (Kosciw et al., 2014). In addition, 15% face harassment so severe they are forced to leave school altogether (Kosciw et al., 2014). Transgender students overall have lower grade-point averages and are less likely to pursue higher education opportunities than their cisgender peers (Kosciw et al., 2014). Both in and out of school, transgender students report feelings of invisibility, anxiety, and depression (Kosciw et al., 2014).  Due to these troubling patterns, it is essential that future school faculty and administrators be trained in advocacy for these students to provide adequate support for   2 their specific needs. School psychologists, for example, are ethically obligated to provide advocacy and consultation for all their students, including transgender youth (NASP, 2010). Possessing knowledge of the specific issues facing transgender youth is vital in improving school climates and increases the likelihood a school psychologist can be an effective advocate for transgender students (Graybill, Varjas, Meyers, & Watson, 2009). School psychologists who receive specific education surrounding transgender issues tend to have more positive views towards working with transgender students, have greater knowledge regarding these students, and an increased willingness to engage in social activity regarding LGBT needs (Bowers, Lewandowski, Savage, & Woitaszewski, 2015;  Arora, Kelly, & Goldstein, 2016). School psychologists are encouraged to increase their knowledge about issues of gender identity (Savage, Prout, & Chart, 2004). With their knowledge, they can provide information, support, and external services to families, students, and school staff to address the myriad issues facing transgender students (Grossman, D’Augelli, Howell, & Hubbard, 2005; Payne & Smith, 2014).  Past research suggests that school psychologists are undertrained in transgender issues and underprepared to work with transgender students. Specifically, school psychologists are not prepared to interfere with bullying that involves a student’s sexual orientation or gender identification. Eighty-five percent of school psychologists report no preparation or education in their graduate program regarding gender identity issues (Savage, Prout, & Chard, 2004). Some research suggests that school psychologists report feeling uncomfortable to handle these issues if they were to arise (Rutledge et al., 2012). Furthermore, Savage, Prout, and Chard (2004) found school psychologists are severely uninformed of the realities transgender students face. In another study, recent graduates   3 reported they could not advocate for transgender students because they fear that colleagues and administrators won’t support their work or, worse, reprimand them for it (Perry, 2010). These studies highlight how ill-prepared school psychologists have been in working with their transgender population; however, transgender issues are more at the forefront of public awareness and policy today than when these studies were conducted. The lack of training may be attributed to the lack of awareness many school officials and government administrations had about gender diversity in addition to the lack of research there seems to be about the experiences of transgender students (Graybill & Proctor, 2016).  Awareness and advocacy for transgender civil rights have been increasing dramatically in the past few years.  New York State (NYS) legislators, for example, passed and implemented the Dignity for All Students Act (DASA) as the first law approved by NYS to include a reference to protections for gender identity and expression (New York State Education Department, 2013). DASA has not been the only sign of changing attitudes; the National Association of School Psychologist, for example, has issued a position statement about safe schools for transgender and gender diverse students (NASP, 2014).  Progress, however, is not linear and subject to the winds of political administration and appointments. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Education and Justice released joint guidance to help schools ensure the civil rights of transgender students, only to be rescinded with no replacement in 2017 by the following presidential administration (Lhamon & Gupta, 2016; Battle & Wheeler, 2017). Schools’ bathroom policies continue to be a hot button issue, having faced multiple court challenges to   4 finally be denied by 2020 in the Supreme Court cementing the right for trans students to use bathrooms that affirm their identities (Parents for Privacy v. Dallas School District No. 2, 2020). This judicial decision is juxtaposed by a White House executive order banning governmental agencies from providing certain diversity and inclusion training to their employees (Exec. Order No. 13950). Political culture represents potential resistance or acceptance to considering the issues trans students face. This push and pull stresses the importance of training for all school staff to provided consistency, support, and advocacy regarding the mental health needs of this vulnerable yet politicized group despite the standing of their fundamental rights. Combined, these new efforts that highlight transgender issues nationally might lead one to assume that school psychologists are more adequately prepared to handle transgender and gender diversity issues than they once were. However, this assumption has not been measured and there is little information, on the amount of and the standard of training school psychologists are receiving in these school programs. There is a need for new and updated information on the amount and quality of training school psychologists are receiving within their higher education degree programs.  The aim of this study is to understand the extent to which school psychologists are educated on and trained in working with transgender students within their graduate degree programs. This knowledge will help to identify current gaps in graduate curriculums that need to be filled. Additionally, by identifying the level of preparedness newly graduated school psychologists have in transgender advocacy, the field can better inform the creation and implementation of other training opportunities aimed at transgender student advocacy.   5  Literature Review Transgender Youth in Schools Transgender is an umbrella term that refers to those whose gender identity, expression, or behavior differs from culturally determined gender roles and biological sex (National Center for Transgender Equality, 2014; VandenBos, 2007). It encompasses those assigned at birth to one gender who identify with or wish to live as another gender. Cisgender, on the other hand, refers to those individuals whose sex assigned at birth matches their current gender identity. Gender non-conforming and other gender diverse peoples specifically refer to those whose gender expression is different from cultural expectations related to gender (National Center for Transgender Equality, 2014; Gender Equity Resource Center, 2013). Some individuals who identify as neither entirely male nor female may use the term genderqueer (National Center for Transgender Equality, 2014; Center for Excellence in Transgender Health, 2011).  It is difficult to estimate the prevalence of transgender students in schools (Meier & Labuski, 2013). Due to the risks of gender nonconformity or transgender identity in many communities, individuals may choose to conform to societal expectations rather than live outside of those expectations. There are no systematic studies that have been published on the prevalence of gender diversity or transgender identity in youth. According to one analysis of federal and state data conducted several years ago, approximately 1.4 million adults, or about .06 percent of the adult population, self-identify as transgender (Flores, Herman, Gates & Brown, 2016). There is reason to believe that the prevalence of transgender identity may be higher in youths. A Flores et al. (2016) report finds that .7% of young adults aged 18 to 24 identify as transgender. A   6 2015 health behavior survey of about 12,500 high school students in Wisconsin found that 1.5 percent of students identified themselves as transgender (Dane County Youth Commission, 2015). A GLSEN study found that about 25% of the LGBT population in schools identify as transgender, genderqueer, or other gender diverse (Kosciw et al., 2014). Risks and Struggles of Transgender and other Gender Diverse students Transgender, genderqueer, and other non-cisgender and gender diverse students are a high needs group who face extremely hostile school climates. According to the National School Climate Survey conducted by the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), many hear negative remarks about other (actual or presumed) transgender people or are themselves the target of verbal harassment from students and staff alike (Kosciw et al., 2014). Twenty-two percent report being pushed or shoved within the last school year (Kosciw et al., 2014). This bullying and harassment are addressed inconsistently by administrators, teachers, and support staff (Kosciw et al., 2014).  Students are often forced to suppress their gender identity in order to comply with school norms and policies. Anti-LGBT school policies can prevent students from using their preferred names and/or pronouns and/or bathrooms that match their gender identities or orientations. They’re also prevented from wearing clothing that has been deemed inappropriate for their assigned sex (Kosciw et al, 2014). Selecting a restroom or locker room or signing up for gender-segregated activities such as sports, are more sources of discomfort. In all of these instances, transgender students are forced into “lose/lose” decisions where they can either live their truth and face disciplinary   7 repercussions or conform and feel uncomfortable. In instances where administrators grant students the freedom to use the pronouns, bathroom and wardrobe of their choice, students still face the distinct possibility of harassment from peers (Brill & Pepper, 2008; Dreger, 2010; Kosciw et al., 2012; McArdle, 2008). The reality these students face out of school is just as grim. LGBT youth are likely to lack understanding and support within their homes. The more gender nonconforming a child is, the more likely they are to be physically and verbally abused by caregivers (Grossman, D’Augelli, Howell & Hubbard, 2005). LGBT youth experiencing difficulties within their homes may run away, drop out of school, or turn to substance use to cope (Grossman, D’Augelli, Howell & Hubbard, 2005).  Victimization in and outside school contributes to negative psychological and health outcomes. LGBT youth who experience harassment, discrimination and bullying in school have increased rates of absenteeism and poorer academic achievement (Kosciw et al., 2014). These youth are at risk for lower self-esteem, increased feelings of depression, and suicidal ideation (Kosciw, Greytak, Palmer, & Boesen, 2014; Mustanski & Liu, 2013). Youths who experience peer victimization report they are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior (Robinson & Espelage, 2013), use drugs (Rowe, Santos McFarland, & Wilson, 2015) and smoke (Newcomb, Heinz, Birkett, Mustanski, 2014). Research suggests that trans youths who are supported by peers, parents, and school personnel may be protected from negative health and psychosocial outcomes (McConnel, Birkett, & Mustanski, 2015; Snapp, Watson, Russel, Diaz & Ryan, 2015). Beneficial outcomes have been documented for LGBT students who attend schools with Gay-Straight Alliances (Heck, Flentje, & Cochran, 2013). The presence and availability   8 of LGBT-affirming role-models can also decrease psychological distress in LGBT youth (Bird, Kuhns, & Garofalo, 2012). The Role of School Psychologists and Training Programs  The literature linking supportive environments to positive transgender youth outcomes stresses the importance of the school psychologist's role in their transgender and gender diverse students’ lives. School psychologists are in a unique position within schools and thus responsible for instilling a school culture of acceptance and appreciation of diversity and contributing to the overall safe learning environment of a school. Professional organizations have guidelines in creating safe school environments and promoting social justice for transgender and other gender diverse youth (American Psychological Association, 2015; National Association of School Psychologists Principles of Professional Ethics, 2010).   School psychologists are also legally obligated to support the mental health needs of transgender and gender diverse students. Title IX Education Amendments, the federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity, applies to discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression (PL 92-318, 1972). Some states have taken it upon themselves to further extend these protections. New York state’s Dignity for All Students Act (DASA), for example, holds school staff responsible for providing all students, including transgender and gender diverse students, with equal access to safe and respectful education (New York Department of Education, 2013). California also has state laws that specify students cannot be discriminated against based on gender identity or gender expression (Assembly Bill 1266, 2013).   9 For school psychologists to meet their professional, ethical, and legal duties to serve the transgender youth population they must understand the needs and challenges faces by transgender youth (Graybill, Varjas, Meyers, & Watson, 2009). Unfortunately, research focused on sexual orientation and gender identity among youth is scarce in school psychology journals. Graybill and Proctor (2016) found that only .3 to 3% of articles in the past 16 years include research related to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender populations.  LGBT research too often focuses on cisgender sexual minorities. As a result, there is little research that focuses explicitly on the experiences and advocacy of transgender and gender-nonconforming youth. In a call to action, Espelage (2016) counts solely seven articles published that have discussions about transgender youth and none about the experiences of transgender youth.  As of this date, the GLSEN National School Climate Survey is the only study to focus on transgender student experiences on a national level (Kosciw et al, 2014). While it is difficult to parse out the intersections of sexual orientation and gender identity in the transgender student community, it is important to amplify the unique voice of students who identify as transgender and gender nonconforming separate from cisgender lesbian, gay, bisexual and other queer students.  School psychologists may be gaining most of their training in working with transgender youth on their own when they find it necessary to; however, it is suggested that the level of preparedness school psychologists have in advocating for transgender issues is dependent on their working climate. Research suggests psychologists in an LGBT friendly environment are more prepared. Arora, Kelly, & Goldstein (2016) found that the presence of a Gay-Straight Alliance in a school was associated with increased knowledge of the school psychologist about LGBT youth as well as a higher rating of   10 preparedness to treat LGBT youth. On the other hand, school psychologists faced by challenges report barriers to engaging in LGBT advocacy (McCabe & Rubinson, 2008). These professionals may be deterred from seeking the additional training they need to work with their gender diverse population.  School psychologists are best fit to develop this trans affirmative behavior within their professional training programs before they enter into the field. Increased education is associated with improved attitudes and increased preparedness in treating LGBT youth (Arora, Kelly, & Goldstein, 2016); however, limited research exists regarding the training of school psychologists in attending to the needs of transgender and gender diverse youth. There are few studies about the training of psychology professionals, but these are dated and do not look at how well-prepared psychologists are in trans-specific issues. The research that does exists suggests not all school psychology training programs include coverage on LGBT issues. In one study 85% of school psychology professionals reported not receiving specific training in LGBT issues (Savage et al., 2008). This lack of training does not appear limited to the field of school psychology, but a problem in other fields of psychology as well. A survey of APA doctoral programs found that only 60% of clinical and 88% of counseling psychology programs discussed LGBT issues in a multicultural course (Sherry, Whilde, & Patton, 2005). Given the lack of research and training on LGBT issues, it is not surprising that school psychologists and those in training lack knowledge of the issues and difficulties faced by the LGBT community (McCabe & Rubinson, 2008; Savage, Prout & Chard, 2004). Furthermore, given the evidence of discrimination and victimization experienced by transgender youth, school psychologists are more than likely underprepared to address their needs.   11  Methods Participants Participants in this study included graduates of various NASP-approved school psychology programs across the United States. An invitation to participate in the study with a direct link to a questionnaire were emailed to training directors at NASP approved school psychology programs (N=190). Training directors were asked to distribute the questionnaire to their alumni data-base (See Appendix A for letter soliciting participation). When participants directed themselves to the questionnaires, in order to be included in the study, respondents needed to sign the informed consent (See Appendix B for informed consent). Respondents did not receive any incentive or compensation for their participation in the study. There was no way to identify the exact number of people who saw the invitation to participate. Because participation was voluntary, with participation solicited via the alumni email listserv, the respondents to the survey are considered convenience samples. All respondents who completed the entire survey were included in the analysis. Design and Procedure  A portion of the present investigation used survey data. Questionnaires were formatted into electronic versions via the Qualtrics online survey program (See Appendix B for questionnaire). A letter of introduction and passive consent outlined the research project as a whole and invited participation in the study. Participants were then directed to click on the research link to record their responses to an online questionnaire. Completion of the online questionnaire took participants about three to five minutes.   12 The present investigation also relied on the evaluation and coding of syllabi. The programs for inclusion in this portion of the investigation were gathered from the NASP website of approved programs. The present research scanned course bulletins of the selected programs for possible courses that cover transgender-specific issues, including but not limited to multicultural courses. Courses were identified by the presence of the following pre-determined keywords in the course descriptions: Gender, sexuality, LGBT, transgender, diverse/diversity, culture/multi-cultural/cross-cultural. Once courses were identified, the program directors of each program were contacted in order to request the identified course syllabi (See Appendix C for letter format requesting information). In order to ensure all possible courses were identified, the directors were also inquired about any other possible courses that cover transgender-specific content not requested to address concerns about constricted names and course descriptions within the bulletins themselves. Once all syllabi were gathered, information about the courses and their respective programs were compiled into an excel spreadsheet.  This included the following basic information about the program: region located, population setting, the presence of a religious affiliation, and highest level of degree offered.  Obtained syllabi were read through and coded for the following: (a) the year of the syllabus, (b) whether the course is a requirement or an elective, (c) whether the course was a multicultural course, (d) the number of course topics that include content related to transgender students and,  (e) the number of reading assignments related to trans youth.  As the syllabi do not speak to the quality and breadth of trans affirmative training, relevant assigned readings for each course were read and analyzed for the inclusion of the   13 following content: (a) the development of gender identity and presentation including social expectations and limitations; (b) the stigma and barriers transgender and gender diverse students experience; (c) systems-level advocacy efforts school psychologists can take on behalf of transgender and gender minority individuals; (d) the challenges and strategies for responding to bullying, intimidation, and other forms of harassment towards transgender and gender diverse students when perpetrated by students or staff; (e) specific counseling for the social-emotional needs of trans youth. Syllabi were also scanned for the inclusion of a self-reflection assignment that attempts to challenge the inherent potential biases within school psychologists towards transgender and other gender diverse individuals. Each syllabus was given a score for the number of aforementioned content it covered. This score was used for analysis to represent the breadth of content the course offered. Measures. A questionnaire was created to capture school psychology graduates’ perception of competence in working with transgender and other gender minority individuals and to determine what contributed to that competence. Demographic data was also collected. Goal of the Present Study Despite a growing body of knowledge on how school psychologists are trained to work with LGB youth, less is known about how they are prepared to work with transgender and other gender diverse youth. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to fill this knowledge gap. Graduate programs and their alumni were surveyed and the syllabi of programs that address training in this area were examined.     14 Research Questions 1. To what extent are school psychology graduate programs preparing their students in working with transgender and gender diverse youth? 2. To what extent do graduate students perceive their training programs have prepared them for working with transgender students? 3.  Have graduate programs increased their training efforts over time? 4. Are there differences in school psychologist perception of preparedness based on differences in programs?     15 Results  Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data collected using SPSS 24. Demographics  A total of 193 graduates from school psychologist programs across the United States completed the entire questionnaire. The graduation dates of respondents ranged from 1984 to 2019 (M = 2012, SD = 7.68). A majority of the respondents carried master’s level degrees (n = 96), representing 49.7% of the sample, as compared to those with Doctoral level (n = 40) or Specialist level (n = 57) degrees. 91.7% of respondents reported currently working within a school setting (n = 177). Demographic data was compared with data collected in the latest NASP membership survey to assess the sample’s representation of school psychologists in general. While the NASP membership survey reports data regarding the average number of experience years this information was compared with the average graduate year of the sample presuming most psychologists enter the field upon graduation. The sample skewed slightly less experienced, and presumable younger with about four years of difference, than the overall population of school psychologists when compared with a NASP member survey conducted in 2015 (Walcott & Hyson, 2018). The representation of those currently working in a school setting is comparable with the NASP survey, and the sample overrepresents those with master’s degrees (Walcott & Hyson, 2018).  Research Question One  72 total syllabi were collected out of the 355 requested. Descriptives for the programs the syllabi were gathered from are located in the Table 1. Of the syllabi   16 gathered, 48.6% of them represented a multicultural course (n = 35). 65.3% of the total syllabi represented required courses (n = 47). Only 20 of the 35 multicultural courses were required for graduation. The syllabi ranged in year from 2009 to 2018 (M = 2017).  On average, each course included few course topics (M = .556) and readings that covered trans-related content (M = 1.61). When looking at the breadth of content score, on average, courses covered 2.04 of the 6 areas looked at. There was a high correlation between number of content areas covered to the number of related reading assignments and to number of course topics that mention transgender content. According to a linear regression, reading assignments significantly accounted for 62% of the variance of objectives covered within a class, F(1,70) = 113, p < .001. Number of trans-related course topics accounted for 58%  of the variance, F(1,70) = 95, p < .001. Frequencies of criteria presence is reported in Table 2.  Significant differences were found between multicultural courses and non-multicultural courses. Multicultural courses (M = 3.40) have significantly more reading assignments related to trans youth when compared to non-multicultural types of courses (M = .76), t(70) = -4.07, p < .001. They dedicate more course topics (M = .886) as compared to non-multicultural courses (M = .24), t(70) = -4.14, p <.001. It follows that,  according to a one-tailed t-test, multicultural courses (M = 3.40, SD = 2.05) include a larger breadth of content when compared with non-multicultural courses (M = .75, SD = 1.66), t(70) = -6.04, p <.001. While multicultural courses were more likely to mention the existence of transgender content in their course description (M = .11) as compared to non-multicultural courses (M = .03), this difference was not significant t (70) = -1.46,  p = .075.     17       Table 1  Frequencies of Syllabi Descriptives   Level  Counts % of Total Region East North Central 17 23.6 %  East South Central 7 9.7 %  Mid Atlantic 13 18.1 %  Mountain 6 8.3 %  New England 9 12.5 %  Pacific 3 4.2 %  South Atlantic 8 11.1 %  West North Central 4 5.6 %  West South Central 5 6.9 % Population Setting Rural 5 6.9 %  Suburban 19 26.4 %  Urban 48 66.7 % Religious Affiliation Secular 58 80.6%  Religious 14 19.4% Highest Level of Degree Offered Doctoral 35 48.6%  Masters 20 27.8%  Specialist 17 23.6%     Table 2  Frequencies of Course Content Areas  Counts % of Total Gender identity 28 38.9 % Stigma and barriers 33 45.8% Systems-level advocacy  14 19.4% Counseling needs  21 29.2. % Responding to harassment 18 25 % Inherent bias 33 45.8  %    18    Research Question Two The overall mean perception of preparedness in working with trans youth reported by graduates of school psychology programs was 2.94 (SD = .809) falling between the little to somewhat confident range. A sample of 193 school psychology graduates were asked what experiences contributed to their competence in their work with trans youth. In general, most of the respondents did not believe their graduate training contributed to their competence with only 66 of the respondents reporting that graduate training contributed to their competence. The highest number of respondents reported that field experience contributed to their competence (n = 103), followed by professional development (n = 96), with conference workshops reported by the least number of respondents as contributing to competence in working with trans youth (n = 63). Respondents were prompted to indicate on a Likert scale to what extent each of these reported areas contributed to their competence. Respondents who did not indicate a specific area contributed to their competence were coded as zero for analysis.  As the present research is interested in graduate training specifically, a simple regression was conducted to predict respondents’ confidence working with transgender or other gender minority youth from their perception of how well their training programs have prepared them. The model produced an adjusted R2 of .10. The current model significantly accounted for 10% of the variance of graduate confidence working with   19 trans youth, F(1,192) = 22.774, p <.001. The overall mean perception of graduate training contribution to preparedness was 1.09 (SD = 1.632).  To further investigate the extent to which factors contribute to confidence in working with trans youth, a multiple regression was conducted to investigate graduate confidence in working with trans youth from four variables: their perception of the extent graduate training, professional development, conference workshops, and field experiences prepared them for working with trans youth. The model with all four predictors produced an adjusted R2 of .22. The current model significantly accounts for 22% of the variance  of school psychology graduates’ confidence in working with trans youth F(4,189) = 14.60, p < .001. The regression model intercept significantly differed from zero, B = 2.45, t(193) = 28.65,  p < .001. Conference workshops were not a significant predictor of respondents’ preparedness, B = .02, t(193) = .43,  p= .67 (95% CI for B coefficient [-.06, .09]). The mean perception of conference workshops contribution to preparedness is 1.06 (SD = 1.56).  However, graduate training, professional development, and field experiences were all significant predictors of respondents’ confidence ratings, B = .11, t(193) = 3.29, p = .001 (95% CI for B coefficient [.04, .17]),  B = .08, t(193) = 2.38, p = .02, (95% CI for B coefficient [.01, .15]), and B = .12,  t(193) = 4.31, p < .001 (95% CI for B coefficient [.07, .18]), respectively. The mean perception of field experiences contribution to feelings of confidence is 1.89 (SD = 1.88) and the mean perception of professional development contribution to feelings of confidence is 1.57 (SD = 1.68).    20 To further explore field experiences impact on confidence ratings, an ANOVA was conducted to investigate the population each respondent worked with on their ratings of confidence. In general, the older the population a respondent worked with the higher their ratings of confidence in working with transgender youth (Table 3). Significant differences were found between groups. Those who worked with teenagers were significantly more confidence than those who worked with children, t(4,188) = -3.33, p = .009 and those who worked with preschoolers t (4,188) = -2.81, p = .043. When respondents were asked to specify other experiences that contributed to their competence in working with trans youth, 62 individuals responded in this open-ended question.  The responses were read through and categorized together based on common themes. Most individuals responded that personal connections within the LGBT community mostly informed their knowledge in this area. 30 of the 62 respondents mentioned having a friend, family member or other personal connection to the LGBT community that contributed to their competence. Some respondents (n = 16) also cited their experience working with specific students that informed their knowledge, while 11 of the responses mentioned taking it upon themselves to do their own research into to the subject area. Other responses that could not be categorized in these three domains mentioned a specific class in their graduate training (n = 2), online training (n = 1), conference workshop (n = 2), consultation with their peers or mentors (n = 2).       21 Table 3  Confidence Based on Population Served  Population Served N Mean SD Confidence Preschoolers (1-3 years of age) 8 2.38 0.92   Children (4-9 years old) 81 2.77 0.80   Adolescents (10-12) 32 2.94 0.76   Teenagers (13-18) 63 3.21 0.76   Adults (over 18 years old) 9 3.33 0.87  Research Questions Three  In order to investigate whether graduate training to work with trans youth is increasing over time, a simple regression was conducted to predict confidence working with transgender youth from graduation year. The model produced an adjusted R2 of .038. The current model significantly accounted for 4% of the variance of graduate confidence in working with trans youth, F(1,191) = 8.54,  p < .05. The regression model intercept significantly differed from zero, B = .02, t 192) = 2.92, p < .05). To further assess this research question, a series of regression models were fitted, first predicting the year using the perception of graduate training preparedness, then respondents' confidence in working with trans youth using both the perception of graduate training preparedness and graduation year, and finally, the respondents' confidence in working with trans youth using the perception of graduate training preparedness.  In step one of the mediation model, the regression of the graduation year on confidence in working with trans youth, ignoring the mediator was significant, B = .022, t(191) = 2.92, p < .05. Step two showed that the regression of the graduation year on the   22 mediator, perception of graduate training preparedness, was also significant, B = .08, t(191) = 5.73, p < .001. Step three of the mediation process showed that the mediator, training, controlling for the year, was significant B = .14, t(190) = 3.92 p <.001. Step four of the analysis revealed that controlling for the mediator, graduate training, graduation year was not a significant predictor of confidence in working with trans youth, B=.01, t(190) = 1.30, p = .19. A sobel test was conducted and found full mediation in the model (z = 3.1985, p = .001). It was found that graduate training fully mediated the relationship between graduation year and confidence working with trans youth. In this case, while graduate training was a significant predictor for both the confidence and the year, it is no longer significant in the presence of the mediator variable, confirming the mediation effect. The effect size was .01, with a 95% confidence interval; which did not include zero; that is to say the effect was significantly greater than zero at a = .05. Research Question Four In order to investigate differences in school psychologist perception of preparedness based on differences in programs a series of t-tests were conducted based on specific factors.  In looking at graduates from programs with a religious (M = 2.64, SD = .68) or no religious affiliation (M = 2.99, SD = .83), there is significant difference in confidence in working with trans youth based on religious affiliations of graduate training t(191) = -2.56, p = .01. There is also a significant difference in the two groups ratings of the extent to which their graduate training contributed to their competence in working with transgender youth, in that respondents reported that the training they received from their secular programs contributed more to their competence in working with trans youth   23 (M = 1.21, SD = 1.70) when compared to individuals from religious affiliated programs (M = .56, SD = 1.18), t(191)= -2.23, p = .03.  While perceptions of graduate training seems to depend on religious affiliation of respondents’ program, similar results were not found in the syllabi analysis. Religious affiliation was not related with whether the course description mentioned trans youth t(70) =1.133, p = .26, number of course topics that mentioned trans youth t(70) = -.496, p = .621, number of reading assignments that included relevant content t(70) = -0.301, p = .765, or number of criteria covered t(70) = -0.315, p = .754. Location of the graduate program did not appear to impact respondents’ perception of training or confidence in working with trans youth. No significant differences were found between rural (M = 1.44, SD = 1.88), suburban (M = .78, SD = 1.44), and urban (M = 1.14, SD = 1.55) schools in respondents’ perception of graduate training F(2,121) = 2.68, p = .07. No significant differences were found in respondents’ confidence either between rural (M =  2.98, SD = .861), urban (M = 2.95, SD = .77), and suburban (M = 2.92, SD = .82) settings according to a one way ANOVA F(2,124)  = .105, p = .901. Similar results were found in the syllabi analysis, in that there was no difference in the number of criteria covered within the course based on population setting grouping F(2, 10.4) = 2.11, p = .17. In looking at respondent’s degree level, doctoral students (M = 3.08, SD = .703) were generally more confident in working with trans youth as compared with those who graduated with a masters (M = 2.93, SD = .874) or a specialist degree (M = 2.91, SD = .739), however this difference was not significant according to a one-way ANOVA, F(2,189) = .59, p = .556. Additionally, there was no significant difference in perceptions   24 of graduate training contribution between doctoral (M = .92, SD = 1.44), masters (M = 1.10, SD = 1.75), or specialist degree graduates (M = 1.10, SD = 1.63), F (2,190) = .356, p = .701). However, when looking at syllabi, there are significant differences based on highest level of degree offered. Generally, schools that offered specialist degrees, included more course topics that covered transgender content, F(2, 38.1) = 4.05, p = .03 included more reading assignments, F(2, 31.7) = 8.82, p < .001 and covered a larger breadth of content F(2, 37.6) = 7.44, p = .002 than schools who offered masters and doctoral degrees. Means for each group can be found in Table 4.

The results provide evidence that  school psychologists generally feel little to somewhat confident in their ability to work with and advocate for transgender and other gender diverse. Generally, it seems that school psychologists are entering the field undertrained to work with trans youth, with a majority of the sample receiving more training via their field experiences and professional development than in their graduate programs. For those who did report receiving graduate training, it is a significant predictor of their confidence in working with this population.  There seems to be a trend of graduate programs providing more training in working with transgender youth over time. Respondents who were more recent graduates felt their graduate training better prepared them to work with this population than those who graduated longer ago. It seems that as trans issues become more prominent in mainstream discourse, graduate programs are adapting their courses in order to be more inclusive of this population.  There do not seem to be many significant factors of the graduate programs themselves that impact the level of competence they provide graduate students. Population setting did not seem to impact the inclusion of transgender content within a program’s curriculum, nor the graduates' perception of their training, nor their confidence. Religious affiliation and level of degree offered provided mixed results. While individuals from secular schools perceived their graduate programs as better preparing them to work with transgender youth as compared with those graduates from   26 schools with a religious affiliation, there was no significant difference in transgender-related course content between schools in an analysis of syllabi. Similarly, there were no differences in respondent’s confidence of perception of graduate training between degree levels, but in the syllabi analysis, programs that offered specialist degree tended to do better on the three measures of course content (e.g. number of assigned reading, course topics, and objectives covered). It is difficult to account for the differences between graduates’ perceptions of their programs from the programs themselves. One reason may be attributed to the biases of the respondents. Respondents from religious programs may assume their schools were not providing as much trans-related information and content as a secular school. As respondents tended to skew younger, and theoretically more accepting of the transgender experience, they may have higher expectations of what programs should cover, thus underestimating the amount of education they received. Similarly, doctoral graduates perhaps perceive their programs as providing more content on the subject given the amount of time they spent within those programs. Specialist programs may be offering more classes that focus on practical skills within schools as opposed to research and theory traditional to doctoral programs. As such, it would seem that what contributes most to quality of transgender training is dedicated time within a course to transgender content. Courses which dedicated more course topics and included more reading assignments in turn covered more variety in content.  Multicultural courses tended to do better on these variables than courses of other kinds. It seems that graduate programs are relegating their transgender content into multicultural classes as opposed to integrating trans issues throughout their training   27 curricula. This is alarming considering only about half of the multicultural courses investigated were required in order to obtain the degree, indicating it is up to the individual themselves to seek out and learn this information.  This may reflect a lens of teaching that prioritizes teaching skills based on a normative heterosexual cisgender population, and a view that work outside of this population is specialized. The truth is transgender youth are becoming the normal in the populations that school psychologists work with. Transgender and other gender minority youth experience mental health difficulties that may require intervention at the school level (Kosciw, Greytak, Palmer, & Boesen, 2014; Mustanski & Liu, 2013). Because of this there is a need for future school psychologists to be trained in transgender issues in their training programs. Further stressing this need is the finding that field experiences also significantly contributed to respondent’s competence in working with trans youth. Individuals who worked with teenagers reported feeling more confident in working with transgender youth as compared with school psychologists who worked with younger students. This population has the highest estimated percentage of individuals who identify as transgender (Herman, Flores, Brown, Wilson, & Conron, 2017), meaning that school psychologists who work with teenagers have a higher likelihood of gaining experience in working with transgender youth. Field experiences are important because they provide direct training with this population; however, we must also be wary of the possibility that school psychologists learning “on the job” is unfair to this vulnerable population.   Respondents also highlighted other factors that contributed to their competence in working with trans youth in an open-ended question within the questionnaire. Responses   28 mostly revolved around personal connections within the LGBT community. While it is fortuitous that these psychologists are privileged with a connection within the LGBT community to contribute to their knowledge base, most psychologists arguably do not have connections within the community and are missing out on this experience. Another common theme in the open-ended question was psychologists taking it upon themselves to research in order to grow their competence, further highlighting the need for more formal training in this area.  Another interesting dichotomy is the difference between professional development and conference workshops, the former contributing significant competence to psychologists’ confidence and the latter did not. These are both structured opportunities for psychologists to continue their professional growth after they graduate, one taking place within a school building and the other organized by professional organizations. Schools may be more likely to recognize the need for their staff to develop their training in this area than professional organizations as they have the more direct connection with this population. While it is positive that schools are recognizing this need and providing training opportunities for their staff, this dichotomy also highlights the area in which professional organizations may need to step-up their efforts. In looking at the content of courses within graduate programs there are several directions for improvement. First, graduate programs may want to consider increasing the overall amount of transgender content they provide in their overall curriculum. It seems many programs relegate trans issue within a multicultural course, which may or may not be required for degree obtainment. Given the number of specialized groups that a multi-cultural course must cover, there is simply not enough time to give trans issues the time   29 they warrant to develop competence within graduates. Furthermore, it is difficult for programs to offer required transgender specific courses given the breadth of material and content they must cover in their overall curriculum. As such, program may find it more reasonable to integrate transgender issues within their current content in order to ensure this population is not left forgotten. In looking at the six objectives analyzed within the collected syllabi, three of the six were included in less than 30% of the sample. These objectives include specific counseling for the social-emotional needs of trans youth, systems-level advocacy efforts, and strategies for responding to harassment faced by trans youth. These three areas cover some of the greatest challenges faced by trans youth within school (Kosciw, Greytak, Palmer, & Boesen, 2014; Mustanski & Liu, 2013). Furthermore, the lack of coverage of these topics within graduate programs may account for the barriers school psychologists have in supporting trans youth in these regards (Rutledge et al., 2012). These three areas represent a need for improvement of training within graduate programs.  Limitations and Future Directions There are several limitations to this study. Self-report measures are vulnerable to biased responding, as reflected with some of specific discrepancies between respondents’ reporting and what is found within the actual content of the courses. As this study solicited participants for a study about working with transgender students, participants who may be more open to learning to work with the population may have self-selected to complete the questionnaire.  In general, it is assumed the sample skewed younger, as evidenced by graduation year. Additionally, the average graduate year of the sample is higher than the presumed   30 average graduate year of school psychologists in general as evidenced by mean years of work experience (Walcott & Hyson, 2018). Those who are younger tend to be more open to gender diversity (GLAAD, 2017). As such, the confidence in working with trans youth reflected in the sample may be higher than that of the general population of school psychologists and limits the generalizability of the results.  Respondent’s perception of their graduate programs may also be subject to personal bias, which may account for some of the differences between graduate perceptions and syllabi analysis. Specifically, respondents from religious programs may have assumed their schools were not providing as much trans-related information and content as a secular school based on their own bias of religion.  Biases are reflected in the syllabi collection. As courses were chosen based on their probability of including trans content, the amount of trans content within these courses is not reflective of all school psychology courses in general. As such, it is assumed that the prevalence of trans content generally within programs is even less. Furthermore, as these courses, which are highlighting trans issues within their syllabi, are often not meeting all of the content areas looked at, the probability that this content is covered within the general curriculum of school psychology programs at large is even less and reflects an even greater need to increase trans-related content within school psychology programs. Last, not all programs responded to requests of syllabi. Only about a quarter of the syllabi requested were provided. It is impossible to determine how the responses from these programs would have influenced the results. However, it is possible that programs with little trans content within their curriculum may not have wanted to share their   31 syllabi, possibly skewing the results in a positive direction. The lack of cooperation from universities in sharing information about their curriculum to the present researcher also highlights poor efforts in the field to promote more study and knowledge in this area and may be indicative of why there is little research on the subject matter in general published. In hindsight, the present investigation would have been stronger with another researcher to do the screening of the bulletins, coursework, and readings to have some degree of objectivity that could have been address with an inter-rater reliability analysis. The study would have also been stronger if specific information was collected from the respondents about the quality of their training programs. It would have been useful for respondents to report on the breadth of exposure to transgender material in their courses, such as whether this material was integrated throughout their coursework or relegated to a multicultural class, and the breakdown of transgender exposure in practicum. This provides an area for further research. There are also strengths to the study. It represents the one of the first projects to assess the extent to which NASP-approved training programs are beginning to address transgender issues within their curriculum. Information from this study provides a point of reference for future discussions about training strengths and weaknesses in the area of transgender competency. The fact that syllabi were directly analyzed may also be considered a strength as it is a direct source of information to corroborate and add validity to the perspectives of the graduates of those programs. The current study should be regarded as a general overview of how training programs are addressing transgender training.    32 This study also warrants the discussion for further research. Further research may want to explore the shortcomings in training in other fields of psychology as past research as indicated there is a lack of training in clinical and counseling fields, and these are other important areas of support for individuals in the trans community (Sherry, Whilde, & Patton, 2005). Competence is another direction for future research. While this study examined confidence, it cannot be equated to actual competence in working with trans youth. Respondents may feel more confident than their competence warrants. Gaining an objective measure of how school psychologists are performing in the field is valuable information.     33 Implications for School Psychology The findings of this study point to a need for more training in working with trans youth within school psychology programs. While school psychologists receive training in other formats, such as professional development, that contributes to their confidence in working with trans youth, the training school psychologists receive within their graduate programs is often the only training they have when entering the work force. This study highlights the ways in which graduate training is leaving school psychologists underprepared for working with trans youth. Psychologists seem to be supplementing the training they receive within their programs with independent research and study, capitalizing on any personal connections with the trans community, and learning “on the job” when working with trans youth directly.  School psychologists with more training within their graduate programs have more confidence in working with trans youth. As such, programs should want to increase the quantity and quality of their trans-specific content to better prepare their graduates and increase their confidence. There are several avenues for programs to take in order to accomplish this. Programs which do not cover trans issues within their multi-cultural courses may want to begin introducing some of this content within their curriculum. Programs which do not require a multi-cultural course for degree obtainment may want to begin to make this a requirement.  Better yet, programs may want to consider incorporating content throughout their entire curriculum and into core courses, such as counseling courses. This study provides direction in where programs may want to integrate their trans-specific content. Programs may want to focus their efforts on practical skills school psychologists need in working   34 with trans youth such as in the areas of counseling and system-level advocacy as these were the content areas in which programs fell most short.  Integrating trans and gender diverse content is likely achieved as a function of integrating diversity issues in general. Graduate programs need to challenge the idea that psychology can be taught separate from the people it serves. To relegate all issues of diversity to a course in which each identity is covered in a chapter or weekly course topic is a disservice to everyone. To truly obtain cultural competence is larger than what can be taught in a chapter. Issues of identity permeate almost every area of school psychology, and it is time for the material that is taught within the classroom reflect this reality. We also can bridge the two notions that field experiences or personal connections with trans and gender diverse individuals contribute to competence and the lack of training provided within graduate programs. Many of the respondents in this study indicated that some sort of personal connection within the community piqued their interest or guided their own personal knowledge in these areas. These personal connections can be built within graduate programs if graduate program work to increase trans and gender diverse representation within their programs in the faculty they hire, and in the students they admit. Time spent with people who are different from us can be a valuable experience and affect out comfortability to working with students who match their experiences. Furthermore, the members who make up a program are an important voice that often guides the type of learning and training everyone receives. The information relayed within a classroom often goes beyond what is within the reading or on the syllabus. Learning in the classroom is often a discussion happening between students. The more diversity in voices within the classroom, the more diversity in the   35 content of the classroom. Universities need to examine the presence of trans and diverse students and faculty within the programs. Representation has significant implications for training and the experiences individuals have in school.  As number of trans individuals within school populations increases over time, the hope is that the trend within this study continues and graduate programs increase the amount of training provided on working with this population to meet this increasing need. This need will hopefully drive graduate programs to incorporate trans-specific content within core graduate coursework, as opposed to relegating this information within multi-cultural courses that may or may not be required for degree obtainment. The need for specific training for this population will become more crucial for school psychologists as most students who receive mental health services do so in school (EAB, 2020).      36 Appendix A Dear [training director]  I am a doctoral student looking to recruit school psychology graduates to complete a survey as a part of my dissertation project.

    "abstract": "This study sought to evaluate school psychologists’ perceptions of their graduate training experience in preparing them to work with transgender and other gender minority youth. The quality of graduate training was also examined through a compilation of syllabi. The participant s (N = 193) completed a questionnaire regarding their confidence in working with this population, their perceptions of what contributed to their competency, and information about their graduate programs. The resulting sample of respondents came from all geographic regions in the United States, 91% of whom were currently working in a school setting. A series of regressions found that graduate training accounted for significant variance in respondents’ confidence in working with transgender youth, despite a majority of respondents reporting that they received no graduate training on the subject suggesting that those who did receive training found it valuable. This perception of graduate training contributing to respondents’ competence appears to be mediated by graduation year suggesting that programs are increasing their training efforts over time. Syllabi from identified courses of graduate programs across the United States were coded on a number of factors including number of readings assigned, number of course topics covering transgender content, and course type (e.g., multicultural). Each identified assigned reading was read for pre-identified content to gain an understanding of the breadth and depth of content covered within the course. Significant relationships were found between breadth of content covered and the amount of reading assignments or course topics related to transgender content a course offered. There were significant differences across all three factors when comparing multicultural courses with other types of courses. Few significant differences were found in comparisons made based on a number of programmatic and respondent differences including level of degree obtained, religious affiliation, environment, region, and graduation year. Recommendations for enhancing training relevant to transgender youth are presente",
