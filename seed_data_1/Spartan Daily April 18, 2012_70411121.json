It is something that I have felt since I can remember, but I have a lot of gay and bi friends who would ar-gue otherwise.”SPARTAN DAILYWednesdayApril 18, 2012Volume 138, Issue  40 SpartanDaily.com77 years... and countingFreshman Computer Science major Tony Huang plays a non-alcoholic version of beer pong at a raffle booth during the “Benefit Concert for Africa” yesterday on Tower Lawn.

Phone:  (408)291.0677,  website: www. loftbarandbistro.comAddress: 90 South 2nd Street, Downtown, San JoseHOW IT AFFECTS SJSUAccording to Dennis Jaehne, vice president for undergradu-ate studies, SJSU was mandated by the Chancellor’s Offi  ce to implement the unit cap in the upcoming fall semester.“Th e Chancellor’s Offi  ce sent out a lett er to all the CSUs saying this is what you have to do,” he said.Students who are engineer-ing and science majors, which are consider high-unit majors, will be allowed to take more units because these majors require students to take more than 120 units to complete their degree, Jaehne said.Jaehne said graduating seniors will be allowed to take 18 units, but if you are not a graduating senior you will have to write a proposal requesting to take more units.Whitney Zeller, a junior hospitality recreation and tour-ism management major, said she thinks that the CSU system needs to get this budget issue together as soon as possible because it is starting to have a major aff ect on students and their degrees.“Th ey really changed it up on us,” she said, “and they are expecting us to graduate on time?”Zeller said she recently was made aware of this unit cap during a meeting with her ad-viser in which her adviser told her that it was a CSU rule and not something that SJSU want-ed to do.On the other hand, students like senior recreation major Keith McCullom II does not think that this unit cap is a bad thing at all and thinks that tak-ing 15 units is fair to most.“More than 15 units can be a lot for the average student but I can understand why many stu-dents would be upset,” he said.McCullom said for a person like himself with a schedule outside of school, taking only 15 units doesn’t seem to be a big issue to him because he has other things besides school to worry about.Garren Byrd, a junior eco-nomics major, believes that this cap of 15 units is ridiculous.“You go to college with the expectation of graduating as soon as possible and with this unit cap it just prolongs the process,” he said.As students express their outrage and concerns about this new unit cap and their doubts about graduating on time, Chapin said this unit cap is something that will help dis-tribute the limited resources provided by the CSU’s system this fall.According to Chapin, this unit cap will serve as a basis for all students to progress toward graduation because it will give students an equal amount of units, despite the limited edu-cational resources due to state funding.“Th e unit cap serves to en-sure that all enrolled students have a fair access to the limited supply of courses,” she said.FROM PAGE 1UNIT CAP: Science, engineering majors to be exemptWaves of concert-goers wait in line along Paseo de San Antonio for Tuesday night’s concert headlined by Rise Against at the Event Center.

Katehi took “full responsibility” for the pepper-spraying of students on the University of California, Davis campus, only one tent re-mained on the quad.It was one of those pop-up shade structures that had been set up to advertise a nearby apartment complex.Just a week aft er the release of the fi rst comprehensive re-port on the Nov. 18 incident, life on the campus appears like that at any other college.Th e Occupy protesters are gone, and the quad is fi lled with sun-worshipping students play-ing music or preparing for Sat-urday’s Picnic Day celebration.But Katehi, in her fi rst public comments since the release of the 190-page report from for-mer state Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso, clearly is deter-mined to move quickly to ad-dress the problems outlined in the critique.“Th e report illuminated very clearly and critiqued sharply the missteps within the admin-istration and the police which led us to a very unfortunate and regrett able event,” she said. “As I said in November and I repeat right now, I take full responsibil-ity for the incident and I consid-er myself accountable for all of the actions that need to be taken to ensure our campus is a safe and welcoming place.”She added that she wants to see changes made that will en-sure “that something like this does not happen again.”Katehi’s remarks came dur-ing her annual State of the Campus report to the Academic Senate, and members were gen-erally polite during and aft er her presentation.“I appreciated the sense of urgency about the matt er,” said Ralph Aldredge, a mechanical engineering professor. “Mis-takes were made by the admin-istration and the police, and I’m confi dent that she’ll do what’s necessary to move us forward.”Stephen Wheeler, an associ-ate professor of landscape archi-tecture, said he hoped “that the university will get its act togeth-er and move on.”“We need leadership that talks about social needs and the vital role of the university in helping society think through its problems.”Katehi has apologized before for the handling of the police operation she ordered to remove tents set up on the quad as part of a protest against rising tuition.She has maintained that she never would have agreed to send the police in if she had known they might use force. Reynoso’s group found that she and her top administrators failed to communicate clearly with each other in their planning sessions to remove the tents.Th e report, presented again Tuesday at a separate public ses-sion at UC Davis, also lambasted the campus Police Department for what it found to be a “dys-functional” command structure.Katehi promised the Senate she would conduct a “holistic top-to-bott om review” of the department.She also suggested she would consider forming a police review commission, and said interim Chief Matt  Carmichael already is seeking out independent ex-perts to suggest improvements that can be made.Campus offi  cials say they expect changes in some campus operations to be made quickly, and Katehi noted aft er her re-marks that the report “gives us guidance to move forward.”Meanwhile, Katehi waits for reports from the Academic Sen-ate and the UC system, along with fi ndings from the now-completed internal aff airs inqui-ry into offi  cers’ conduct that day.Katehi said no actions have been taken against administra-tors connected with the Nov. 18 incident and that it is “prema-ture” to say whether any action will be taken.She spoke only briefl y Tues-day about the pepper-spray incident, spending most of her presentation on campus achievements and hurdles still facing UC Davis.Th ere were about 80 faculty members and others gathered for her remarks inside the Me-morial Union. And, in a sign of how the focus on her is fading somewhat, there were only a handful of reporters and no television cameras present.Reynoso himself said last week that he does not believe she should resign over the pep-per-spray incident, and some students on campus Tuesday brushed aside questions about whether she should leave.“She should stay, she should,” said Mari Salazar, a 21-year-old fourth-year student from Mon-terey who is studying commu-nity and regional development. “I don’t think it’s solely her fault, what happened.”Bobby Vinograd, a 21-year-old history major from South-ern California, was sitt ing with Salazar on the quad and said he believes most students’ focus has moved on from the Nov. 18 incident.by McClatchy TribuneWire ServiceWednesday, April 18, 2012 SpartanDaily.com NEWS   3Remember\u0003to\u0003always\u0003carry\u0003your\u0003Tower\u0003Card\u0003&\u0003Library\u0003Card\u0003to\u0003ensure\u0003student\u0003library\u0003privileges!\u0003HEGLIG, Disputed Sudan — Nine months aft er Sudan split into two nations in search of a peace brokered by the United States, it is now clear that the two sides are at war.Diplomats discussing the armed confl ict talk of skirmishes and dustups, but a visit to this border region shows that what is taking place here is no accidental exchange of fi re by troops confused about where the border lies. Instead, what’s happening is a headlong mobilization involving not just thousands of Sudan’s and South Sudan’s best forces and heaviest equipment, but heavily armed rebels from the distant Darfur region fi ghting along-side the South Sudanese troops.Whether an emergency peace plan could curb the escalation remains to be seen. But neither side is talking to the other, and the mood here is weighted with the sober inten-sity of wartime.On Sunday evening in a looted Sudanese garrison in Heglig, South Sudanese gener-als drew military positions in the sand with a curtain rod. Th ey were expecting an imminent counteroff ensive by Sudanese troops. Soldiers stood by, twitching, on edge.Suddenly, missiles rained in, and artillery pounded the earth behind.“We are under att ack,” yelled South Sudan’s Maj. Gen. Mangar Buong, the commander. Troops scurried, trucks spun out.Th e international community has con-demned the fi ghting and has called on South Sudan to withdraw. But its leader, Salva Kiir, has publicly re-fused to do so.Th e fi ghting started last week on the road to Heglig, an oil outpost with a military base that had long been controlled by Sudan. Th e two sides faced off  at a de facto border point marked now only by the start of a miles-long trail north of rott ing corpses and feasting birds.Who fi red fi rst is unclear, but from there, the fi ght spread northward to Heglig, which fell to the South Sudanese army a week ago.Heglig now is a reeking graveyard of car-nage. Two destroyed tanks sit on the road. Scraps cover the red dirt and debris fl oats in the dry wind. Batt ered signs proclaiming the Chinese-led oil consortium that worked here poke above heaps of loot from its offi  ces — chairs, fi le cabi-nets, TVs, refrigerators — waiting to be hauled south as bounty.Meanwhile, hundreds of South Sudanese soldiers stream up the road in large trucks to join the fi ght as Sudanese war planes hunt from above, pummeling the ground with bombs and rockets.Th e South Sudanese army is using the cap-tured Sudanese garrison in Heglig as a forward operating base. Soldiers pick through piles of clothes and half-fi nished meals while peek-ing at the sky in fear of the Sudanese planes above.Stores of weapons were left  behind, includ-ing crates of anti-person-nel mines, banned under a treaty Sudan ratifi ed in 2003.Th e confl ict is not new. Ever since British colo-nialism handed power to Sudan’s northern, Arab elite in the 1950s, war be-tween the two sides has been an off -and-on aff air.But that war was sup-posed to have ended with the creation last year of South Sudan as an independent nation — at least, that was the hope of the U.S. and West-ern allies who brokered the 2005 peace deal that gave South Sudan the right to split away.Instead, the splitt ing of Sudan now appears only to have turned an internal war into an international one, with much more fi repower on all sides. Th e new dimensions of this old confl ict are starkly evident on the front lines. Th e South Sudanese army is no longer the guerrilla force of old, but sports its own tanks, anti-aircraft  weapons and sovereign land. It’s joined by rebels from the Justice and Equal-ity Movement group, who swooped in from Darfur laden with vehi-cles and heavy weapons, some likely from Libya.Th e Darfur reb-els have been fi ghting against the Sudanese government for years and have joined this new front with gusto. Th eir trucks are scrawled in Arabic and mounted with heavy weaponry, including one large anti-aircraft  gun.“JEM oyee!” yelled one fi ghter in a green tank top and dirtied white turban as he pulled to a stop, beer can in one hand and steering wheel in the other. A machine gun was mount-ed on the passenger seat, in front of his boyish sidekick.Th e alliance with the Darfur group raises questions about South Sudan’s plan and how far it intends to press the batt le. Brig. Gen. Makal Kuol Deng, in command of Heglig, said he did not know what the end goal was. “If they (headquarters) say go ahead, we go ahead,” he said. “If they say stop, we stop.”Other South Sudanese military offi  cials say that they have no intention of pushing far north, into what they consider proper Suda-nese territory, and only want to defend their border. But the presence of the JEM rebels from Darfur, who are seeking to overthrow the government of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, suggests otherwise. JEM and a weaker Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Army, have joined up with South Sudan-aligned rebels in Sudan’s Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile. Together, the rebel alliance calls itself the Sudan Revolutionary Force.Th e Sudanese army is bett er armed, but it seems drawn thin and disillusioned. In the Nuba Mountains, the rebels have been making surprising gains against the gov-ernment forces. Here, it appears that the Sudanese army withdrew suddenly without a spirited fi ght.Th ere is no foreseeable endgame. Th e one hope for peace is that neither side can aff ord war for long. Landlocked South Sudan shut down its oil production in January, unable to reach an ex-port deal with Sudan. Now, with Heglig’s oilfi elds shut down as well, Sudan, too, is facing a currency crisis.Logic and sober analysis, however, over-look the depth of bitt erness felt by both sides and the comfort with which a population that barely knows what peacetime means accepts violence and destruction.Careening down the road back southward, the South Sudanese soldiers pointed at the corpses outside, dozens of Sudanese soldiers who’d died in batt le. Stripped of boots and valuables, denied a Muslim burial, they decay out in the open. Th e air reeks of death. “Jellaba,” the South Sudanese say, using derisive slang.Amid trail of dead, little doubt Sudan and South Sudan are at warSouth Sudanese troops prepare for battle in the disputed border town of Heglig, on Sunday.

Workers peered out windows and looked up from sidewalks. Motorists pulled to the side of the road to catch a glimpse of the spectacle: Th e space shutt le Discovery piggy-back on a modifi ed 747, fl ying low over the monuments of the nation’s capi-tal before landing at Dulles International Airport on the way to its permanent new home with the Smithsonian.“Folks were prett y excited. It was a prett y special moment and a great show,” said Adrienne Watson, an aide to Rep. Lorett a Sanchez, D-Calif., who was among the congressional staff ers who gathered at the U.S. Capitol to watch the historic fl yover. Th e plane fl ew at about 1,500 feet but made low passes at Dulles and Reagan airports and Joint Base Andrews in its last air show.Th e Discovery is the fi rst of the retired shutt les to be delivered to their fi nal des-tinations aft er a fi erce competition for the rare space artifacts. Others are headed to the California Science Center in Los Angeles, the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in Manhatt an and the Kennedy Space Center visitor complex in Florida.Jeff rey Solsby, a congressional staff er who watched the fl yover from the win-dow of his Capitol Hill offi  ce, said his wife Michelle took their daughters, 6 and 4, out of school to see “something I’m sure our girls will remember for a long time.”In Arlington County, where teachers took students outside for fl yover, Barrett  Elementary School Principal Th eresa Bratt  said in an email, “Th e children told me that they wanted to reach up and touch it because it seemed so close.”But for Texas congressmen, the fl yover was a bitt er reminder that Houston, home of mission control, was passed over for a retired orbiter.“One of these vehicles belongs at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, not on the Intrepid in NY,” Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, wrote on his Facebook page. “Shame on the White House for play-ing politics with a national treasure.”Th e fl yover was such a big event, even in a city accustomed to historic moments, that AAA Mid-Atlantic issued a warning to motorists: “Don’t let anyone or anything — even a space shutt le overhead — distract you” and “For safe shutt le-spott ing, pull off  the road and park your car.”A similar fl yover is planned for New York City next week for its shutt le delivery.Shuttle Discovery finds final resting placeSpace shuttle Discovery, mounted atop a NASA 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), flies over the Washington skyline on Tuesday, as seen from a NASA T-38 aircraft. Photo courtesy of Robert Markowitz / MCTby McClatchy TribuneWire ServiceObama proposes steps to curb oil market manipulationby McClatchy TribuneWire ServiceWASHINGTON — Facing heat for high gasoline pric-es, President Barack Obama tried to shift  the focus to Congress, Republicans and energy traders, calling for legislation that he said would “put more cops on the beat” to crack down on poten-tial manipulation of the oil market.Obama called on Congress to provide more money for regulators and increase pen-alties for market manipula-tors. Th e president, fl anked by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Att orney General Eric H. Holder Jr., suggested that traders and speculators are aff ecting the price of oil and digging into Americans’ pocketbooks.“We can’t aff ord a situ-ation where some specula-tors can reap millions while millions of American fami-lies get the short end of the stick,” Obama said in brief remarks in the Rose Gar-den on Tuesday. “Th at’s not the way the market should work.”Obama’s proposal would add $52 million to the bud-get for the Commodity Fu-tures Trading Commission, which oversees oil futures markets, to pay for improved technology and additional employees. Th e president also proposed increasing the maximum civil and criminal penalties for manipulative activity in oil futures mar-kets and beefi ng up data col-lection.Republicans have pushed to trim the CFTC as part of their budget-cutt ing push.Independent analysts and Republicans quickly ques-tioned whether Obama was exaggerating the eff ect of speculation on the market. Th e White House did not point to any evidence that il-legal conduct was on the rise.Independent analysts have said speculators are a factor in the recent surge in oil prices but are not the main reason. A study last month by the Federal Re-serve Bank of St. Louis said global demand has been the main driver of higher oil prices over the last decade. Speculation was the second-largest factor, accounting for about 15 percent of the rise, the study said.Republicans on Capitol Hill labeled the proposed leg-islation a political ploy.But the president argued that the measures were nec-essary to prevent illegal trad-ing as the volume of trading increases.“Imagine if the NFL qua-drupled the number of teams, but didn’t increase the number of refs,” Obama said. “You’d end up having havoc on the fi eld, and it would diminish the game. It wouldn’t be fair. Th at’s part of what’s going on in a lot of these markets.”Obama’s expected Repub-lican opponent, Mitt  Rom-ney, accused the president of over-regulating industries and slowing production.“He’s made it harder through trying to push the (Environmental Protection Agency) into regulating fracking for natural gas and oil, made it harder to get a reliable supply of gas, made it harder for those that mine coal and for those that use coal, made it harder to drill for oil,” Romney said as he campaigned near western Pennsylvania’s coal country.Domestic oil and gas production actually has in-creased, and fracking — a technique primarily for pro-ducing natural gas — is not a direct factor in the price of gasoline. Still, the issues of energy and regulation are likely to resonate further as long as commuters are pay-ing more at the pump.It’s possible that gasoline prices already have peaked. Prices have fallen nationally for the last two weeks aft er reaching a high of $3.941 on April 2. Crude oil futures prices, which have risen steadily since October, also have gradually been edging lower, according to Energy Department data.But prices remain mark-edly higher than they were a few months ago, which has helped make energy a weak spot for Obama. A Pew Re-search Center survey released Tuesday found that two-thirds of voters called energy a very important issue in the election. Romney had a slight edge with voters who saw en-ergy as a top priority.Th e White House’s strate-gy for changing that dynam-ic looks much like its strate-gy on other pressing issues _ use the unpopular and dead-locked Congress as a politi-cal foil, putt ing the onus on lawmakers to act and chiding them for disagreeing with the president.“Congress should do all of this right away,” Obama said. He also blasted congressio-nal Republicans for blocking legislation that would have eliminated subsidies for oil companies.“Here’s a chance to make amends, a chance to actually do something that will pro-tect consumers by increasing oversight of energy markets,” he said.LONDON — Anders Behring Breivik, who has confessed to killing 77 people in a rampage last July, went on trial Monday in Oslo for Norway’s worst crimi-nal episode since World War II.Th e 33-year-old right-wing extremist has admitt ed to slay-ing 69 young people gathered for an annual Labor Party political camp on the Norwegian island of Utoya on July 22 aft er killing eight other people by detonat-ing a homemade bomb that de-stroyed a government building in the Norwegian capital.Breivik appeared calm and defi ant as he entered the court-room dressed in a dark suit and wearing handcuff s. He surveyed the media and public packed in-side the courtroom and smiled. Family members and survivors of the att acks were in the public sector, separated from the defen-dant by thick glass partitions.Aft er his handcuff s were re-moved he gave a raised-fi st fas-cist style salute before sitt ing down and giving a brief state-ment, saying: “I do not recognize the Norwegian courts. You have received your mandate from political parties which support multiculturalism.” He said he ac-knowledged the acts but that he carried them out “in self defense.”Breivik’s antagonism to Is-lam, Muslim immigrants and multiculturalism has been aired in documents and statements since the killings. Th rough his lawyer he has said he was sorry he “didn’t go further” to kill more than the 77 victims.  In essays on the Internet he has proclaimed himself a knight on a crusade against what he sees as Norway’s “cultural sui-cide” and expressed anti-feminist views along with his hatred for Norway’s Labor government, which supports both immigra-tion and multiculturalism.On Monday, he listened im-passively as prosecutor Inga Be-jer Engh listed the 77 victims and the manner of their death in an hour-long statement.Svein Holden, also speaking for the prosecution, gave the court an account of Breivik’s past life and his fascination with extreme right-wing politics. Th e court was shown photographs of Breivik’s tiny bedroom and the remote farmhouse where he stockpiled weapons and explo-sives. In other photos, Breivik posed in a self-styled military uniform, holding an automatic rifl e and sporting medals and badges — one reading, “Multiculti (sic) Traitor Hunting Permit.”Th e court saw and heard of his allegiance to the Knights Templar, his version of a militant Christian religious order that no longer exists, and was shown Breivik’s own 12-minute propa-ganda fi lm making references to the group. During the showing, which was not broadcast outside the court, Breivik was seen to burst into tears as he watched.Holden also gave a detailed account with fi lm and CCTV footage of Breivik’s actions on July 22, including recordings of the shots he fi red on the island and his own calls to the Oslo po-lice to announce his deeds dur-ing his 80-minute att ack.Although initially deemed in-sane aft er his surrender to police and subsequent arrest, Breivik has recently been reassessed and judged to be sane. Th e most recent evaluators warned that there was a “high risk of repeti-tion of violence.”Under Norwegian law he faces a maximum penalty of 21 years in prison, which can be ex-tended to life. When Breivik was read the charges of crimes of ter-rorism and murder last month, Holden told reporters they were “crimes of a dimension we have no previous experience with in our society in modern times.”Breivik will have fi ve days to present his case which, reports say, will not be broadcast.Confessed Norwegian killer goes on trialNorway’s mass killer Anders Behring Breivik gestures in a courtroom in Oslo, Norway, on Monday.

Featuring  President Qayoumi, Sally Ashton,  Nils Peterson  and more  Light refreshments  and information about SJSU’s  Legacy of Poetry  April 19, 2012  11:45 AM - 3 PM Caret PlazaOutside of  MLK LibraryEdwin Markham, American PoetVisit www.sjsu.edu/reading/poetry.htmfor more information and to  sign up to read a poemSeminar tackles food safety ‘Legalize Gay’ exhibit brings awareness to students at King Library Mark Sheppard, a senior pre-law studies major at San Jose City College, recently launched a “Legalize Gay” cam-paign.“Most of my work revolves around social issues,” Sheppard said.According to Sheppard, the purpose of the campaign is to show support and awareness for Proposition 8.Th e “Legalize Gay” cam-paign photo display is located on the fourth fl oor of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library.According to the exhibit, “Th is nuanced petition rises to address the issue of inequality in response to the discrimina-tion of same-sex marriage.”Th e campaign includes black and white photos of dif-ferent types of people holding a sign that says legalize gay.According to Sheppard, the people that are photographed are all volunteers and support-ers of the campaign.“Th e way it started was or-ganic,” Sheppard said.He got the idea for the cam-paign during a lecture in his women’s studies class, he said.“I have a really igno-rant teacher, who made a really ignorant comment,” Sheppard said.According to Sheppard, out of fear for his grade, he sup-pressed his frustration toward his teacher and decided to start the “Legalize Gay” campaign.Th e campaign has 200 pho-tos and the number continues to grow, Sheppard said.Th ere are currently seven pictures posted in the library, with more to come in the next week, according to Sheppard.He will add and rotate the pictures during the duration of his two-month exhibit to ensure all of his volunteers are presented.“Th is project has a good way of centering people and networking,” Sheppard said.He hopes to raise enough awareness so that the Supreme Court rules in favor of gay marriage, he said.According to Candice McGee, event coordinator for King Library, Sheppard’s ex-hibit will be on the fourth fl oor until the end of May“I felt that with the Proposi-tion 8 and all the stuff  that’s in the news right now that it was a good exhibit to have,” McGee said.Th e fourth fl oor will become dedicated to displaying student work, according to McGee.“I thought this is one way of expressing the fact that we can get this out there,” McGee said. “Some people are going to like it, some people aren’t, but at least it is freedom of speech.”Viewers can see the exhibit from diff erent fl oors of the library.“I really don’t have a prob-lem with gay marriage,” said Gabriela Gomez, a senior child development major. “If they choose same sex that’s their option. If they’re happy, they’re happy.”According to Gomez, the campaign does a good job of promoting awareness.“Everyone in the poster, they’re all diverse,” Gomez said. “Not everyone is the same and I think it shows that all types of people have the right to feel how they feel and not be afraid of it.” by Angelisa RossStaff WriterTh e MOSAIC Cross Cultural Center hosted a discussion titled Genetically Modifi ed Foods: Hurtful or Helpful?, to roughly 30 students and other att endees on Th ursday.Th e two-hour discussion led by Jose Pineda, a junior health science major and diversity ad-vocate intern for MOSAIC, gave a slideshow presentation to individuals about the history, science and political issues regarding geneti-cally modifi ed foods.“We set up the discussion because I wanted students to be educated on the fact that there are some positives and negatives of geneti-cally modifi ed food,” Pineda said. “I wanted them to (be) informed and make an informed decision on whether to boycott  research or to just support research in the future.”Some pros mentioned are that crops can be saved from pest infestation and produce can last longer when consumers purchase them.In contrast, genetically modifi ed foods include potential health risks and a shortage of food due to decomposing.According to ProQu est, an online library re-source, the term “genetically modifi ed foods” is most commonly used to refer to crops created for human or animal consumption using the latest molecular biology techniques.Th ese plants have been modifi ed in the laboratory to enhance desired traits such as increased resistance to herbicides or improved nutritional content.Th e presentation gave Kyle Chak, an unde-clared junior, a new awareness about what food purchases to make and what foods to eat.“I rather watch carefully with what I eat,” Chak said. “If there’s any health risks they want me to know — then that’s what I want to watch for.” Chak added that the presentation gave him an in-depth understanding about how food is modifi ed by science.Norman Borlaug, of the “Green Revolution” initiatives, applied scientifi c research by ex-perimenting on new cereal strains and putt ing them into extensive production in order to feed the hungry people of the world—thus provid-ing, as he said, “temporary success in man’s war against hunger and deprivation,” according to the U.S Department of Agriculture.A documentary fi lm titled “Food Inc.” was presented to the class in an eff ort to further educate and inform students about how corporate farming has almost monopolized agribusiness.Th e Monsanto Company is the leading producer of genetically engineered seeds, with 90 percent of all U.S. market seeds coming from the company, according to the documentary.According to the fi lm, Monsanto has put farmers out of business because of longer lasting crops.Monsanto has patented their seeds and farmers who choose to use their seeds must abide by their rules.Annabel Salamanca, a junior Mexican-American studies graduate student, said she found herself confl icted about modifi ed food.“If we look at it, the economic perspective of GMO’s, I guess I would be for it simply because more than half our country is low income and they couldn’t aff ord organic foods,” Salamanca said. “But other than that, I think I would be against it.”Th e event’s discussion gave students and others the opportunity to take their own understanding of science and agriculture and apply it to their daily nutrition.Th e on-campus celebration of Earth Day will be tomorrow and booths will be set up throughout campus with information on how to be green and help make the environment bett er.by Eddie FernandezStaff WriterThe “Legalize Gay” exhibit displayed on the fourth floor of MLK Library.

Th e fi rst inning had a chance for the Spartans to score, starting with junior outfi elder Markesha Collins hitt ing a single.Freshman outfi elder Michelle Cox reached fi rst base on a fi eld-er’s choice, advancing Collins to second base.Sophomore catcher Jessica Garcia went to fi rst base aft er gett ing hit by a pitch, advanc-ing Cox to second base and Collins to third base.However, Cox got out at third base aft er a double play by sophomore infi elder Annica Wolfe.Cardinal sophomore desig-nated player Danielle Miller hit a double, with freshman infi eld-er Hanna Winter then reaching fi rst base on a bunt and advanc-ing Miller.Freshman outfi elder Leah White then hit a single to bring Miller home and Winter to sec-ond base.Th e score became 1-0 in fa-vor of the Cardinal.Spartan senior pitcher Jen-nifer Ames was then brought in to pitch.During the bott om of the third inning, SJSU almost scored to tie the game, starting with se-nior catcher Breanna Lopez be-ing walked.Junior outfi elder Vanessa House then hit a double to ad-vance Lopez to third base.However, Lopez didn’t score as sophomore outfi elder Britney Helm hit a grounder to fresh-man pitcher Nyree White.During the fourth inning, Stanford senior catcher Maya Burns hit a single, then ad-vanced to second base aft er a sacrifi ce bunt from freshman outfi elder Cassandra Roulund.Miller was then walked, ad-vancing to third base aft er a fi elder’s hit put freshman Erin Ashby on fi rst base.Th e inning ended aft er Burns got out at third base.During the fi ft h inning, the Spartans had another oppor-tunity to score, starting with a single to Cox and a single from Lopez and Cox advancing to second base.House hit the ball out to right fi eld, advancing Lopez to second base and Cox to third base.Th e inning ended when Helm got an out aft er hitt ing a grounder to fi rst base.Th ings turned around dur-ing the bott om of the seventh inning.Pridmore was brought back in to pitch for the Spartans, helping to end the game and claim the win.Collins fi rst hit a single to right fi eld, with Cox then get-ting a walk and advancing Col-lins to second base.Garcia followed with a sin-gle, allowing Collins to score, followed by Cox.Th e Spartans would win 2-1.Pridmore said the last in-ning was a litt le scary, but they needed to get a win and not get shut out.“Sooner or later, someone is going to hit the ball,” House said.She said Stanford had to pitch to her or Garcia, making it a sure thing for the Spartans to get a hit.House said they made a mis-take of putt ing in the team’s second-string pitcher and that the team outhit them.“Th is was a signature win, and we need to prepare now for Utah State,” said SJSU head coach Peter Turner.Turner said the team stayed above the ball nicely at the plate and outplayed the Cardinal.He said the momentum car-ried over from the team’s win against Fresno and that the team has been playing great.“We have to fi nd good ways to win with a one run lead,” Turner said.by Rebecca DuranStaff WriterSJSU freshman pitcher Madison Fish throws against the Stanford Cardinal yesterday.

Photo by Derik Irvin / Spartan DailyTh e SJSU baseball team knocked off  No. 10 Stanford University on Tuesday in Palo Alto, Calif., continuing the momen-tum built by sweeping Fresno State on the road over the weekend.Stanford (22-10, 5-7 Pac-12) was com-ing off  back-to-back series losses and is now 6-7 in its last 13 games.As for the Spartans (18-14, 3-0 WAC), they extended their winning streak on the road to seven games.Th e Cardinal drew fi rst blood, scoring twice in the second inning, but SJSU re-sponded in the fi ft h inning when sopho-more fi rst baseman Matt  Lopez singled and freshman outfi elder Kalei Contrades doubled to advance Lopez to third base.With men on second and third base, ju-nior outfi elder Michael Gerlach hit a sac-rifi ce fl y, scoring Lopez from third base.Aft er several bunt att empts, it was ju-nior infi elder Tyler Christian who drove in Contrades with a single into the out-fi eld and tied the game, 2-2.However, while the Spartans would load the bases later in the inning, they were unable to capitalize on any more runs or take the lead in the game.Th e two teams would remain tied for the next three innings before the Spar-tans tacked on a run in the eighth inning to take the lead over the Cardinal.Th e inning started when Stanford walked both junior outfi elder Nick Schulz and Lopez on a total of eight pitches, put-ting the Spartans in scoring position with one out in the inning.Aft er a failed double steal, Gerlach stepped to the plate with two outs and Lopez on second base.  Gerlach singled into the outfi eld, scoring Lopez and giv-ing the Spartans a 3-2 lead.Junior pitcher Zack Jones took the mound in the ninth inning, recording his seventh save of the season and the win over Stanford.Th e victory made SJSU the winner of eight of its last 10 games, including winning its last four games.Th e Spartans used a total of seven pitchers on Tuesday at Sunken Diamond, starting with D.J. Slaton and ending with Jones to close the game out in the ninth inning.Th e seven pitchers allowed just two runs on fi ve hits to the Cardinal.Lopez led the way for the Spartans at the plate, going 2-for-3 on the day. How-ever, Gerlach went 1-for-3 at the plate and drove in two of SJSU’s three runs on the day.SJSU will return on Friday when the Spartans begin a three-game series with Hawaii at Municipal Stadium.Staff ReportWednesday, April 18, 2012 SpartanDaily.com OPINION  7Editorial BoardRon Gleeson, Executive EditorBritt any Patt erson,Managing EditorJasper Rubenstein, Photo EditorDorian Silva, Photo EditorSection EditorsNick Celario, Sports EditorScott  Semmler, Sports EditorJeff rey Cianci, A&E EditorChristina Molina, A&E EditorWesley Dugle, Opinion EditorMargaret Baum, Features EditorLeo Postovoit, Tech EditorProduction DeskNic Aguon, Production EditorDaniel Herberholz, Production EditorAngelisa Ross, Multimedia EditorMatt  Gerring, Online EditorCopy DeskChris Marian Cynthia LyJeremy InfusinoDaniel HerberholzSenior Staff  WritersAshley FindenFrancisco RendonDanreb VictorioStaff  WritersSamantha ClarkRebecca DuranEddie FernandezChristian GinAlyxandra GoodwinTy HargroveMegan MillsJulie MyhreGregory NelsonAngelisa RossBoris SlagerNina TabiosJulie TranDavid WongStaff  PhotographersSierra DurenRaphael KluzniokDerik IrvinContributing PhotographersJack BarnwellJesse JonesBrian O’MalleyNick RivelliJason ReedJames TensuanAdvertising Staff Amanda Fuller, Ad DirectorJustin Acosta, Assistant Ad DirectorLaura Hulberg, Creative DirectorKristine Young,Assistant Creative DirectorJames CoyleAlexander de LeonShanique FlynnLuis MarquezRussell Soffi  ott oSandra TamHang TranSusan TranErrol VillasantaTiff any YangAdvisersMack Lundstrom, NewsJan Shaw, NewsKim Komenich, PhotoTim Hendrick, AdvertisingTim Burke, Production ChiefTim Mitchell, DesignPat Wallraven, ManagerDistributionDaMarlynn WrightTh omas TrumpServing San José State University since 1934Spartan Dailywww.spartandaily.comLett ers to the editor may be placed in the lett ers to the editor box in the Spartan Daily offi  ce in Dwight Bentel Hall, Room 209, sent by fax to (408) 924-3282, emailed to spartandailyeditorial@sjsumedia.com or the Spartan Daily Opinion Editor, San Jose, CA 95192-0149.Lett ers to the editor must contain the author’s name, address, phone number, signature and major.

But Obama won women over in categories such as foreign policy, family values, jobs and the economy.Now, I can’t speak for all women, and I’m a bleeding heart liberal, especially on social issues, but Romney just strikes the wrong chord with me.I’ll acknowledge that’s far from a scientifi c diagnosis, but the amount of sliminess that oozes from the overly tan Romney zaps what litt le cred-ibility he might have.I’ve got two major qualms.Th e man wants to enact more tax cuts for the wealthy — his proposal would abolish taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains for anyone with incomes of $250,000 a year or less, while also keeping the Bush-era tax cuts in place.Let’s get a litt le real here.Th is economy we’re living in — not so good. We’re all strug-gling. We feel it when we fi ll up our cars, buy groceries and check our savings statement.But for the portion of Ameri-cans, and this is arguably a small portion, who are making it, Romney is proposing we al-leviate their fi nancial burden.I am a strong believer that for those who foster the entre-preneurial spirit in America, who have been lucky enough to be able to live the American Dream, part of their success is directly related to the unique in-frastructure of this country.Corporations can thrive in this country because the work-force is fairly well-educated, or at least has access to education.We have an advanced net-work of roads thanks to the government and our tax dollars. Th ere is the postal system, our currency, and the list goes on. Th ese things have been priori-tized by the government and all of us, including the rich, have benefi ted from them.I like my food not killing me, which is why programs like the FDA are things I’m not OK with sacrifi cing. Slime-factor number two — Romney has the presumptuous-ness to think his vast mountain of wealth shouldn’t separate him from the rest of us.Romney’s estimated his wealth is close to $250 mil-lion. He earned $21.6 million in 2010, mostly from investments, according to tax returns he re-leased in late January.In an interview aired yes-terday with ABC’s Diane Saw-yer, Romney said his wealth shouldn’t prevent him from re-lating to most Americans.Romney’s vast wealth will be paying for a car elevator as part of a $12 million renovation at his beach home in La Jolla, Calif.Th at’s cool. I know I relate to a man who is going to install a car elevator in his beach man-sion. Really, these are the only people I relate to.I know Obama is rich too — not as rich, but still rich. Ac-cording to Th e Atlantic, the Obamas reported a joint adjust-ed gross income of $789,674 and paid $162,074 in federal taxes in 2011. But seriously, a crucial in-sight that the president of the United States should have is to be able to understand what the majority of the country needs and wants.We need and want jobs. Being super wealthy and pro-posing tax cuts for the wealthy accomplish neither of those things.As a woman, I feel as though I have a prett y good sense of people’s character. I’m sure it’s tied to some anthropological de-sire to pick the strongest, most loyal mate, but applying that to this upcoming presidential race, all I can see is a fake, tanned and out- of- touch Republican nominee.Let’s call it women’s in-tuition, and we all know we shouldn’t mess with that.Tupac is dead and we need to move onTupac Shakur died on Sept. 13, 1996 in a hospital from gunshot wounds previously sustained on the Las Vegas strip.He was pronounced dead at the hospital, there was a coroner’s report, his body was cremated and the ashes were spread around Los Angeles.Some people will believe what they want to believe, and even prior to Sunday, there were many conspiracy theo-rists who insisted that Tupac had simply grown tired of the media att ention and was hid-ing on a beach or in a basement somewhere.Nevertheless, the over-whelming evidence suggested that Tupac was gone. Th at was that. And then a life-size holo-gram of Tupac greeted fes-tivalgoers in his voice and performed several tracks with Snoop Dogg at the Coachella Music Festival on Sunday.Now, just to be clear, Tupac is still dead. Please reference the fi rst two paragraphs of this story for the validity of these claims.While I don’t like a lot of the violent, sexist and hateful songs he made, he did make tracks like “Changes,” “Keep Ya Head Up,” “Dear Mama” and “Th ugz Mansion” to address social in-justice and provide words of encouragement, hope and love.If you watch interviews with him from early in his career, he exudes charisma. You cannot help but like him.He spoke out against poverty. He (sometimes) de-fended the struggle of women, especially black women in soci-ety. He advocated for the elimi-nation of prejudice (even as he repeatedly used one of the most racist words in the English language).It should come as no sur-prise that people do not want him to be dead, and will resort to sometimes dramatic lengths to keep him “alive.”But like it or not, the man has gone onto whatever comes aft er we die and we should let him be gone.He left  us his writing, mu-sic and movies to remember him by. Do we really need to make his image dance around on stage in front of millions of people and perform “2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted?”Did anybody ask Tupac that before he died?“Hey Pac, we know you’re gonna die someday, but would it be cool if we create a holo-gram in your exact likeness so we can keep making money and pretending you’re still alive?”Somehow, I doubt any-one gained the consent of Tupac to parade what is as close to a copy of his body as we can create around for our entertainment.In writing this I guess I can see the value in enjoying his performance. Aft er all, many people love his music, and music you love almost always sounds bett er live.And who knows, maybe he would want us to be able to ap-preciate his songs “live.” Some-how, I don’t think we will ever know.Regardless, whether or not it’s right may be a moot point anyway: Rumor has it there is a possibility the hologram may go on tour.Stay tuned for updates on the ghost of a dead legend, coming to an arena near you. Senior Staff Writerby FranciscoRendonThis columnappearsevery other WednesdayGSA investigation is a justified actionTh e General Services Ad-ministration is in some hot water.It was recently revealed that they spent tax payers’ money on a 2010 conference and on frivolous family trips, costing a total of $830,000, according to a ABC news article.Th e GSA is a federal agen-cy that oversees government business and hires federal employees, according to its website.Congressional hearings this week will decide the fate of the workers involved.Jeff  Neely, the former Public Building Regional Com-missioner for the administra-tion’s 9th region, is remaining silent as he is accused of be-ing the main organizer of the conference, according to the article.Neely also used money to go on trips to the South Pacifi c, Napa Valley and Las Vegas, ac-cording to a USA today article.I am outraged that a gov-ernment agency would betray citizens by selfi shly using its money for personal trips.Emails between Neely and his wife were shared during Tuesday’s meeting, in which the content alone makes me angry.“Rough schedule per our conversation. Guess this’ll be your birthday present?” Neely said in reference to the illegal spending, according to the article.How did his wife respond, you ask?“Its yo birthday …   We gon-na pawty like iz yo birthday!” according to the article.Th e couple’s trips included luxurious stays in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan, with 115 electronic devices meant for GSA prize ceremonies also go-ing missing, according to the article.Guess what?One of the prizes, an iPad, was traced to Neely’s daughter.Are the greedy acts by certain members of the gov-ernment something Americans still need to deal with?If it wasn’t for Inspec-tor General Brian Miller’s suspicions of the Las Vegas conference, and bringing it to the att ention of Congress, all guilty parties would still be gett ing away with this.Who knows how many more people were involved in this scandal and who will con-tinue to remain at large?I’m hoping an investigation will uncover any of the other employees involved and put them behind bars.Th is country is already in enough turmoil for the people it trusts to be greedy and be-tray them.I guess making deals with resorts and vendors and plan-ning trips was worth the pre-tense they were planned under.GSA administrator Martha Johnson even resigned aft er the scandal was revealed.Th is is supposed to be the company whose tasks include running the rules and regula-tions of travel and conferences for federal agencies, according to Yahoo.If we can’t trust them to not secretly spend tax money on their own trips, who can we trust?Neely couldn’t even take responsibility for his actions, pleading “the fi ft h” and not showing up to Tuesday’s hear-ing, according to the article.At least the GSA is demand-ing he pay back the money, according to the article.All the punishments in the world still doesn’t change this act of betrayal.People should not have to deal with corruption, even though it is rampant around the world.It’s time for the government to be wary of employees’ ac-tions and speak up when sus-picions arise.If the spending has been taking place over the last two years, then why did it take so long for it to be noticed?Th ere needs to be greater scrutiny when this type of spending takes place, but I guess fi nes and prison time will have to do for now.No one should have to stand for the government to use and abuse their hard-earned money.“It’s time for the government to be wary of employees’ actions and speak up when suspicions arise.”Staff Writerby RebeccaDuran SpartanDaily.com Wednesday, April 18, 20128  NEWSBREAKING THE SILENCEA SPECIAL SERIES ON LGBTQIA ISSUESIllustration by Leo Postovoit and Brittany Patterson / Spartan DailyBREAKING DOWN ‘LGBTQIA’You may have noticed the special series header in the Spar-tan Daily this week symbolizing our special series on issues in the LGBTQIA community.Here in California, especially living in the Bay Area, it’s easy to forget that in many parts of the country, the fi ght for equal-ity in the LGBTQIA community is still being fought valiantly.We are the generation that has grown up talking more about LGBTQIA issues than any other before us, but there is al-ways work to be done.Take for example the case of 18-year-old Rutgers student Ty-ler Clementi, who jumped to his death from the George Washing-ton Bridge in New Jersey in Sep-tember of 2010.Clementi, a gay student, was unknowingly videotaped by his roommate Dharun Ravi and hallmate Molly Wei, kissing an-other man. A second att empt to tape Cle-menti was made, and the foot-age was released to the Internet through Twitt er and Facebook. Tyler Clementi’s suicide, along with the suicides of sev-eral other gay teens who had been harassed, moved many members of government, includ-ing President Obama, to express their dismay over bullying in the LGBTQIA community.Federal legislation titled the “Tyler Clementi Higher Educa-tion Anti-Harassment Act,” was introduced and requires schools that wish to receive federal fund-ing to establish anti-bullying procedures and codes of conduct.But it took an 18-year-old man, whose life was just begin-ning, to take his own life before we, as a society, called for action.Th is week the queer commu-nity is observing “Breaking the Silence” week which will culmi-nate in the “Day of Silence” the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Educa-tion Network’s annual day of ac-tion to protest the bullying and harassment of members of the LGBTQIA community.Students across the nation can take a day long vow of silence on Friday that represents the silenc-ing of LGBT students and the people who support them.It’s easy to be apathetic about this cause, but we can’t dismiss it as “Th ese issues don’t aff ect me because I am not a part of that community.”But it does aff ect you because you are a part of the whole of humanity.Bullying, harassment, dis-crimination, and wanting to be-long to a community transcend labels regarding our sexuality. When confronted with a community you’re not familiar with, it can be easy to tune out or shut down. We lose interest or expect other people to do so for us.When we are polarized by an increasingly forceful media we are bombarded by messages from multiple mediums, it’s not acceptable to just sett le with a baseline acceptance.Regardless of terminology, the overarching connection between all of us it that we are humans.Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-gender, questioning, intersex, ally, asexual or straight, we have the same emotions, the same physiological needs and desires.Our lives will take similar paths. We will all live and die, work and sleep, love and suff er loss. All of us together because we are human.Diversity is what sets us apart. Th at we can be diff erent, that we seek to be individuals, these are notions that transcend societal labels.And so we ask you to disre-gard whatever initial reluctance you might feel about under-standing, to set aside the lan-guage and vocabulary and to take a stand on this basis: these issues are not LGBTQIA issues, they are human ones.Editorial: Qu eer community issues are our issues, tooEthnicity: SJSU Qu eer groupsare diverse in opinions, activitiesMyths: Bisexuals, lesbians are oft en misportrayed“Honestly, I dislike the way the media portrays bisexuality.

All day / Campuses nationwideInfographics by Leo Postovoit / Spartan DailyInformation compiled from UC Davis LGBT Center website• LESBIAN: A woman whose primary sexual and affectional orientation is toward people of the same gender.• GAY: A person (or adjective to describe a person) whose primary sexual and affectional orientation is toward people of the same gender; a commonly-used word for male homosexuals.• BISEXUAL: A person whose primary sexual and affectional orientation is toward people of the same and other genders, or toward people regardless of their gender.• TRANSGENDER: Used most often as an umbrella term, and frequently abbreviated to “trans” or “trans*” (the asterisk indicates the option to fi ll in the appropriate label, ie. Transman). It describes a wide range of identities and experiences of people whose gender identity and/or expression differs from conventional expectations based on their assigned biological birth sex.• TRANSSEXUAL (TS):  A person who perceives themselves as a member of a gender that does not “match” the sex they were assigned at birth. Many pursue hormones and/or surgery. Sometimes used to specifi cally refer to trans* people pursuing gender or sex reassignment.• QUEER: Anyone who chooses to identify as such. This can include, but is not limited to, gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgendered people, intersex people, asexual people, allies, leather fetishists, freaks, etc. Not all the people in the above subcategories I.D. as queer, and many people NOT in the above groups DO.  This term has different meanings to different people.  • QUESTIONING: One who is in the process of questioning their sexual identity/orientation/preference.• INTERSEX: People who naturally (that is, without any medical interventions) develop primary and/or secondary sex characteristics that do not fi t neatly into society’s defi nitions of male or female.• ALLY: A person who confronts heterosexism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, heterosexual privilege, and so on, in themselves and others out of self-interest and a concern for the well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and other queer-related people, and who believes that heterosexism is a social injustice.• ASEXUALITY: A sexual orientation generally characterized by not feeling sexual attraction or a desire for partnered sexuality. Asexuality is distinct from celibacy, which is the deliberate abstention from sexual activity. Some asexuals do have sex. There are many diverse ways of being asexual.Cruz said she noticed she was bisexual at a young age.“I probably was around sev-en-ish when I realized I was bi-sexual,” she said. “I think that is around the time we start noticing others in ways more than just friends.”However, Cruz said, since she was young, she suppressed her feelings toward a classmate of the same sex for years.“At that young age, that was when I knew I was att racted to women. I also knew I like boys as well,” she said. “I have had an equal att raction.”Senior photography major Steven Prudencio said one of the myths of bisexuality is that men don’t have the option to be bi-sexual — only women do.Prudencio defi nes bisexuality as “an individual who looks at love in both terms of gender but in a not so specifi c manner.”He said one of the biggest challenges of being bisexual is that there is a double standard.“If a girl is with a guy and she kisses another girl they (her boy-friend) don’t consider that cheat-ing,” Prudencio said. “If a guy is with a girl and he kisses another guy the girl will immediately see it as cheating and will, in many cases, say you are gay.”He said the media play a big role in the stereotypes of bisexu-ality and lesbianism.Prudencio used the example of singer Katy Perry’s song “I kissed a Girl,” which complete-ly obliterated what it means to be a bisexual.Th e song empowers the ste-reotype women have the option to choose who they fall in love with and men do not, he said.“Honestly, I dislike the way the media portrays bisexual-ity,” Cruz said. “I feel they try to sexualize everything. It’s not just about sex — it’s way more than that — it’s about feelings.”Prudencio said he’s seen an artistic photography work where two women are pictured kissing while a man is also present in the room watching them which sends the wrong message about the lesbian community.Stephanie Monterroza, a se-nior nutrition education major, said the media has an eff ect on the queer community and how others view it.“I feel that the media portrays lesbians as hot and is much more acceptable in society than gay men,” she said. “Th e media glori-fi es lesbian woman and is geared toward entertainment for male viewers.”Bonnie Sugiyama, assistant director of the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender resource center, said the idea that males view lesbians as att ractive stems from the media.“Th ere’s porn where there are women together, but I wouldn’t necessarily say that they’re les-bians,” Sugiyama said. “It’s for the entertainment of men, which is diff erent than if you were to watch actual lesbian porn. It looks a lot diff erent.”She said men are more in-clined to be att racted to femi-nine-looking lesbians as opposed to masculine-looking lesbians.“How men react is interest-ing because a lot of it depends on whether or not they think that they can become a party to it or if it serves them in a purpose of being entertained by it,” Sugi-yama said.Due to the media’s portrayal of lesbians, men are inclined to think it’s att ractive, Monterroza said.“What is sad however, is that a lot of folks even in the queer community carry that same belief — you are either queer or not and you’d think they would be more understanding,” she said.“A lot of students face dis-crimination within their own family in an oppressive home environment,” said Chara Bui, a senior environmental stud-ies major. “Q&A SJSU provides a safe space for students  to gather, att end events, explore their own identities and freely express themselves.”EL PAIS DEFINEDEstudiantes Latino’s y el Proyecto Arco Iris, or EL PAIS, meets every Tuesday and Friday to discuss various subjects like Qu eer Latinos in the media and “Latino lingo.”Steven Prudencio, the presi-dent of EL PAIS, said he has been running the club for three years.“I started the club because I wanted a group where I could fi nd more individuals I could re-ally relate to which were Qu eer Latino students who had similar interests,” Prudencio said.A sense of community can be found among the six group members.“Th ough we are a small, tight-knit group we each work for each other in a sense, and if there is something one member wants we all work to execute it as a group,” Prudencio said.Tina Fernandez, who does public relations for EL PAIS, said her favorite part of the group is the social interaction and the discussions at the meet-ings among members.Fernandez publicizes the group through social media such as Facebook and Tumblr to try and get Qu eer Latino stu-dents to att end the meetings.“At times it’s hard recruiting individuals of the same group who identify as Qu eer and La-tino,” Prudencio said.MACHISMO“Culture aff ects me and identifying myself as a Qu eer Latino male,” Prudencio said. “It’s always been a matt er of ac-ceptance within the culture and the masculinity within the cul-ture itself.”Machismo is an overt mas-culinity within the Latino cul-ture, Fernandez said.“I constantly face challenges because I’m Qu eer and female,” Fernandez said. “Th is puts a lot of pressure on me culturally because of machismo and the traditional female roles to cook, clean and be submissive.”Prudencio said EL PAIS is a group for all Qu eer Latinos, who all get along well. Th e group is also accepting of any-one willing to join, including al-lies, he said.LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER RESOURCE CENTERA warm and inviting atmo-sphere surrounds the LGBTRC, with plush couches, tables, scat-tered artwork and vibrant rain-bow motifs.“Th e LGBTRC advises and supports fi ve student clubs, pro-vides leadership development opportunities through train-ing, retreats and conferences, education in the classroom and through workshops, provides safe spaces and opportunities for community development,” Sugiyama said.Th e center, which is located at Modular B, helps with stu-dent identity development, edu-cates on current issues and pro-vides support groups for those wishing to take advantage of the services.Th e LGBTRC is a great place, anyone can come out and join it and be free to express them-selves, Prudencio said.",
