Declaration of Interest statement: The authors declare no competing interests.   2  Social media can be used to both enhance and diminish students’ experiences of university 1 and its influence is strong for LGBTQ+ people facing stigma and discrimination. Students 2 may feel exposed when identifying as LGBTQ+, particularly whilst transitioning to 3 university life. In this study, we used theories of performance and digital personhood to 4 explore how LGBTQ+ students use social media for identity management. We report a 5 thematic analysis of 16 interviews. Four themes were generated from the data, showing that 6 students use social media to explore, conceal, protect, and express their identities. We found 7 that different social media provide stages where LGBTQ+ identities are constrained by 8 different and distinctive social factors. Thus, LGBTQ+ students’ online identities are 9 multiple, situated, and bound to specific platforms, with some alternatives to Facebook 10 offering a space where students may feel more comfortable performing their authentic selves.   11  12  13  Introduction 14 Universities provide opportunities for students to learn, create friendships, and gain the 15 knowledge and skills required for personal growth (Arnett, 2015). Social media can support 16 students in gaining the best experiences of university. Researchers have found that using 17 Facebook to interact with peers is associated with better social adjustment and decreased 18 loneliness (Yang & Lee, 2020; Yang & Brown, 2013, 2015); posting status updates enables 19 students to access support and become known to their peers (Stephenson-Abetz & Holman, 20 2012; Thomas et al., 2017); interacting with future housemates online reduces feelings of 21 uncertainty and awkwardness in offline interactions (Thomas et al., 2017); and, browsing 22 profiles helps students to learn about their peers and obtain information for navigating 23 university (Yang, Brown, & Braun, 2014). 24  25 However, students are not a homogenous group, and students with different social identities 26 will likely have different experiences of using social media, including those who are lesbian, 27 gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other non-heterosexual and gender-diverse identities 28 (LGBTQ+).  In this paper, we understand gender as a “biopsychosocial construct, including 29 aspects of identity, expression, role and experience” (Iantaffi, 2021, p.21). While many 30 LGBTQ+ students identify university as a time for personal growth (Formby, 2017; NUS, 31 2014), others report experiences of discrimination, such as verbal harassment, exposure to 32 written discriminatory comments, physical violence, and a lack of gender-inclusive spaces 33 and inclusive practices for reporting discrimination (Allen, Cowie, & Fenaughty, 2020; 34 Thompson et al., 2019). Postgraduate students also report experiences of discrimination, with 35 doctoral students outlining a range of inclusivity issues and direct instances of homophobia 36 and transphobia (English & Fenby-Hulse, 2019).  37  38 Given these experiences of discrimination, it is likely that students will feel exposed when 39 using social media to identify as LGBTQ+, particularly whilst transitioning to university. 40 Choosing to disclose an LGBTQ+ identity on social media is therefore not only a matter of 41 privacy, but of safety. In the next section, we discuss the literature on LGBTQ+ identities and 42 contextualise them using theories of performance. 43   44 3  1.1 LGBTQ+ identity performance 1 Whilst some LGBTQ+ students have identified university as a time for identity exploration 2 (Valentine, Wood, & Plummer, 2009; Formby, 2017), others have reported hiding their 3 LGBTQ+ identity (Miller, Wynn, & Webb, 2019; Stonewall, 2018). There are many reasons 4 why a person may choose not to disclose an LGBTQ+ identity, such as anticipating negative 5 emotional reactions or changes in relationships; believing that others hold stigmatising 6 attitudes; being uncertain of one’s identity; wanting to maintain others’ perceptions; fearing 7 rejection or punishment due to culture or religion (Schrimshaw et al., 2018). However, hiding 8 one’s LGBTQ+ identity can also have negative consequences, leading to enhanced feelings 9 of rejection, impaired intimacy and acceptance within social interactions; contributing to 10 disproportionately high rates of mental health issues among this population (Newheiser & 11 Barreto, 2014; Bachmann & Gooch, 2018). Displays of gender and sexuality are therefore 12 carefully crafted according to specific social contexts, illustrating the performative nature of 13 gender and sexuality – a lens that we adopt in this paper. ‘Performing’ is central to social 14 constructionist views of gender, whereby individuals are expected to outwardly perform in a 15 way that adheres to social norms (Brickwell, 2006). Butler (1988) theorised that gender 16 identities are co-created, reproduced, negotiated, and internalised, thus taking on a 17 performative quality. Whilst Butler’s work focuses specifically on gender, researchers have 18 frequently adapted her work to understand other expressions of identity, including sexuality 19 (van Doorn, 2009; Wadbled, 2019). 20  21 Morgenroth and Ryan (2020, p.1-2) used Butler’s work to develop a theoretical “framework 22 of the perpetuation and disruption of the gender/sex binary”, which is also relevant to 23 sexuality. They theorised that gender performance comprises four elements: character (i.e. 24 categorisation as man or woman), costume (i.e. body and appearance), script (i.e. behaviour), 25 and the stage upon which the performance takes place (i.e. the physical and cultural 26 environment). Morgenroth and Ryan (2020) argued that sexuality is also relevant within this 27 framework as in many westernised societies, sexuality is conceptualised in terms of 28 heteronormativity1 (McLean & Syed, 2015). Non-heterosexual scripts deviate from this 29 framework and threaten the binary system. We adapt these theories of performance in our 30 work, to interpret LGBTQ+ students’ digital performances of gender and sexuality.  31  32 In part, due to experiences of discrimination, LGBTQ+ students may feel the need to manage 33 their identity expression, particularly whilst transitioning to university. In this article, we use 34 the term ‘identity management’ to refer to the purposeful and unconscious strategies a person 35 uses to tailor their front-stage performances (i.e. behaviour they know an audience is 36 watching; Goffman, 1959). This is sometimes described in terms of deciding whether to 37 ‘come out’ (i.e. the process of disclosing an LGBTQ+ identity to an audience). Unlike their 38 heterosexual, cisgender peers, LGBTQ+ people face unique challenges where they must 39 consciously and consistently disclose their gender and/or sexual identity (Guittar & Rayburn, 40 2016). Instead, Orne (2011) argues that LGBTQ+ people assess specific social situations 41 before determining whether to disclose an LGBTQ+ identity, applying an approach of 42 strategic outness (i.e. the continual and contextual management of sexual identity). 43 Brumbaugh-Johnson and Hull (2018) highlight how strategic outness is also relevant to 44 gender-diverse individuals who continuously make strategic decisions about gender 45 performance and identity disclosure based on social context. They argue that coming out as 46                                                  1 The cultural, legal, and institutional practices that maintain normative assumptions that there are only two genders, that reflect biological sex, and that only sexual attraction between these “opposite” genders is acceptable (Kitzenger, 2005)  4  transgender is ‘best conceptualised as an ongoing, socially embedded, skilled management of 1 one’s gender identity’ (p. 1148). 2  3 With recent developments in technology, performances of gender and sexuality are no longer 4 limited to offline interactions, and one important medium through which identity 5 performance takes place is social media. In the following section, we turn to the literature on 6 the use of social media by LGBTQ+ students and relate it to theories of digital personhood. 7  8 1.2 Digital performances of gender and sexuality 9 LGBTQ+ people use social media to locate online communities, create new friendships, and 10 access information that is not available offline (e.g. Adkins et al., 2018; McConnell et al., 11 2017; Jenzen, 2017). Whilst interviewing LGBTQ+ youth, Bates, Hobman, and Bell (2020) 12 found that social media facilitates safe spaces for identity formation and exploration. This 13 does not negate the fact that social media spaces can be hostile towards LGBTQ+ people. 14 LGBTQ+ people report experiencing online hate-speech, trolling, harassment, and threats of 15 sexual and physical violence (Mkhize, Nunlall & Gopall, 2020; Scheuerman et al., 2018). 16 Consequently, many LGBTQ+ people carefully manage their performances of gender and 17 sexuality on social media (Hanckel et al., 2019). To manage these performances, LGBTQ+ 18 people: use privacy and security controls; monitor self-expression; manage friendship 19 networks; create multiple accounts; curate and edit personal photographs; restrict LGBTQ+-20 related content to spaces that are more anonymous  (Duguay, 2016; McConnell et al., 2017; 21 Vivienne & Burgess, 2012).  22  23 Researchers have used theories of digital personhood to study online performances of 24 identity, with many drawing upon Goffman’s (1959) theory of self to describe the ways that 25 people try to tailor performances of self to particular audiences. danah boyd (2002) 26 recognised the ways that such performances or ‘facets’ could be particularly valuable for 27 marginalised individuals: ‘Maintaining multiple facets can offer relief and empowerment for 28 marginalized individuals, as they can find acceptance and support in certain communities 29 while being shunned by society as a whole’ (p. 27). However, boyd was one of the first to 30 recognise that the management of these different facets is particularly challenging on social 31 media, where certain environmental cues are stripped out and where the platforms might fail 32 to adequately differentiate between audiences – something they described as ‘context 33 collapse’. In subsequent work, (e.g. Marwick & boyd, 2011) we learn more about the ways in 34 which certain social media platforms, such as Twitter, remove context, making it more 35 difficult for an individual to manage their identity selectively and effectively.  36  37 More recently, Kerrigan and Hart (2016) have drawn upon Turner’s (1960, 1974) 38 dramaturgical approach to describe the ways that digital personhood is carefully assembled, 39 depicted, and mobilised through social media. Central to their work is Turner’s (1960) 40 concept of liminality, referring to the state of transition of being ‘betwixt and between’ one 41 state and another. Kerrigan and Hart (2016) identified evidence of ‘multiple temporal selves’ 42 on social media, whereby account holders attempt to bind their activities within certain 43 platforms to manage different states. The availability of past identity performances on social 44 media, however, means that past selves can co-exist alongside present selves, despite 45 transitioning to a new state. Consequently, sometimes performances break down due to a 46 ‘social media leakage’, whereby attempts at keeping different digital identities separate from 47 one another fail. In the next section, we consider what these digital performances might mean 48 5  in the context of university and explore the challenges of digital identity management when 1 students transition to this new environment. 2  3 1.3  University students’ online performances 4 Previous work has highlighted how social media can facilitate students’ transition to 5 university. We focus on this transition as a social one, through which students “learn the 6 university lifestyle” (Barnes, 2017, p.2), rather than a physical or academic transition (Dyer, 7 2020). Thomas et al. (2017) interviewed students about their transition to university, mapping 8 social media changes in the week before and the five weeks after their move. They found 9 many students used the period prior to starting university to curate their digital selves, 10 sometimes removing photographs of pets and family and replacing with photographs of 11 parties and drinking.  12  13 In a follow up study, Thomas, Orme, and Kerrigan (2020) noted the disadvantages of 14 students tailoring their performances in this way. They explored the relationship between 15 liminal selves, social media usage, and loneliness among students transitioning to university 16 life, noting that students who concealed their previous online identities during this transition 17 were more likely to experience loneliness. Yang et al. (2018) described such difficulties in 18 terms of ‘identity distress’, relating to an individual’s inability to reconcile different aspects 19 of self into a coherent whole. They noted that identity distress can be acute at the college (or 20 university) transition, where students ‘leave behind familiar environments and social 21 supports, lose some of their previous sense of belonging, and reconstruct their knowledge of 22 themselves and their contexts’ (p.93). In a subsequent study, Yang and Lee (2020) found that 23 successful transition was in part dependent upon the social media platform used, with 24 targeted communication with friends and family via Instagram having the strongest 25 relationship with social adjustment. 26  27 Such findings are highly relevant to LGBTQ+ students, who may find it more difficult to 28 present LGBTQ+ identities when starting university, who may use particular social media 29 platforms in their performances, and who may also experience forms of identity distress 30 whilst struggling to manage their liminal selves. Our overarching research aim was to explore 31 how LGBTQ+ students use social media for identity management. We had the secondary aim 32 of examining how LGBTQ+ students use social media whilst transitioning to university. We 33 approached our work with a social constructionist lens, and used theories of gender 34 performance (Butler, 1988; Morgenroth & Ryan, 2020) and digital personhood (Kerrigan & 35 Hart, 2016) to guide our research. 36   37 6   1  Method 2 2.1 Participants 3 Participants were recruited via social media using opportunistic and snowball sampling 4 methods. The study was advertised on Instagram, Twitter and university LGBTQ+ student 5 Facebook groups. To be included in the study, participants were required to be registered as a 6 student at a university in the United Kingdom (UK) and identify as LGBTQ+. Both 7 undergraduates and postgraduates were included in the study to increase diversity and 8 facilitate reflective storytelling that captures experiences at different stages of student life. 9  10 A total of 16 participants from a range of universities in the UK took part in this study. 11 Participants were aged between 20-34 (M = 24.63yrs, SD = 4.19yrs). Following current 12 guidelines, participants were asked to describe their gender and sexual orientation, to 13 maximise diversity and foster inclusivity (Blair, 2016). Six participants identified as male 14 (cisgender), five female (cisgender), two transgender (female to male; FTM), two non-binary, 15 and one gender-fluid (transmasculine). 11 participants identified as gay/lesbian, two bisexual, 16 two pansexual, and one heterosexual. Eight participants were studying at undergraduate level 17 and the remaining nine at postgraduate level. Table 1 provides demographic information 18 about the participants and a breakdown of their gender identities. 19   20 7   1 Table 1.

In 2 the demographic form, participants were asked their pronouns, which have been used 3 throughout this paper, thus removing limitations of inherently binary language (Taylor et al, 4 2018) After these forms were completed, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 5 participants between November 2019-January 2020. Eight interviews took place in-person 6 (P1-P5; P7; P8; P16), with the remaining eight conducted via Skype. In these interviews, 7 participants were encouraged to tell ‘stories’ about their experiences of being LGBTQ+ at 8 university. We began these interviews by asking participants to reflect upon their transition to 9 university, their use of social media, and how they managed their LGBTQ+ identities during 10 this time (both online and offline). Participants were encouraged to discuss all social media 11 spaces that were important to them whilst at university. Participants were subsequently asked 12 to describe their more recent experiences of university, including their use of social media.  13  14 For interviews that took place in-person, the scroll back method was used (Robards & 15 Lincoln, 2017), whereby participants were asked to scroll through their social media profiles 16 and discuss them with the researcher. This methodological approach facilitated focused 17 discussions between participants and the researcher, providing tangible evidence of their 18 social media usage. With the permission of participants, we took screenshots of the social 19 media content they discussed, which we later used to guide the analysis. Interviews lasted 20 between 30-60 minutes. 21  22 2.3 Analyses 23 Interview transcripts were imported into QSR International NVivo Pro 12 software and 24 analysed thematically, following Braun and Clarke’s (2006; 2019) approach. The first author 25 (CVT) immersed herself in the data by reading all interview transcripts, marking initial ideas 26 for coding. She then coded the entire dataset independently, before examining and collating 27 codes to identify initial themes across the data. A series of thematic maps were then created 28 to visualise the data, identify links between codes, and develop the themes (see Ziebland & 29 McPherson, 2006). Theme development was informed by a social constructionist approach to 30 gender and sexuality. These maps were critically reviewed by the fourth author (PB) and 31 revisions were made where appropriate. The second author (AT) provided critical feedback 32 on these themes and made recommendations on how to interpret the data. The third author 33 (DJR) critically reviewed transcripts, themes, and the manuscript from the perspective of an 34 LGBTQ+ community member and a gender and sexuality researcher. This added further 35 depth to the analysis process by including both outsider and insider perspectives (Mullings, 36 1999). The themes and participant quotes resonated strongly with the third author’s reading 37 of the data and personal experiences of being an LGBTQ+ student.  38  39 The final themes were generated by CT and agreed upon by all co-authors. Themes were 40 named using quotations from interviews, to ground the findings in the data, ensuring 41 LGBTQ+ youth voices remained central to the project and that results were accessible, 42 meaningful, and impactful for this group (Franklin & Toft, 2020). We used various strategies 43 to increase rigor and trustworthiness, including: engaging in reflexivity, adopting a teamwork 44 approach to analysis, asking peers to critically review the analysis, and leaving a clear audit 45 trail. 46  47  48 9   Results 1 We generated four themes from the data, showing how LGBTQ+ students explore, conceal, 2 protect, and express their identities on social media (see Table 2). Participants primarily 3 discussed their use of Facebook, which may reflect the fact that universities encourage 4 students to use Facebook to contact peers and student groups. As a result, most themes relate 5 to students’ Facebook usage. The process of ‘coming out’, whether that be disclosing an 6 LGBTQ+ identity for the first time or going through this process again with a new group of 7 people, was central to participants’ narratives. Participants applied an approach of strategic 8 outness (Orne, 2011), whereby they used social media to selectively manage their LGBTQ+ 9 identities.  10  11 Table 2.  Themes overview  12 Theme Description Explore: ‘I was able to finally think about who I was’ Exploration and development of LGBTQ+ identities at university, which is facilitated by social media. Conceal: ‘You're trying to uphold some kind of fantasy’ Concealment of authentic selves on social media for impression management. Protect: ‘Facebook is where relatives live, Facebook is where you’re sensible’ Protection of LGBTQ+ identities on social media to manage multiple selves. Express: ‘I feel like my online space is more curated than real life’ Expression of authentic selves on social media.  13  14 3.1  Theme 1. Explore: ‘I was able to finally think about who I was’ 15 Some participants identified university as a place where they could safely explore and 16 perform their LGBTQ+ identities, mirroring the work of Formby (2017). P3 describes the 17 freedom they have been afforded at university: 18 ‘It was quite nice because I was able to finally think about who I was and be more 19 free with who I was as well because I didn't feel like I was going to get judged by 20 anybody because no one knew me’ P3, non-binary, bisexual. 21 University provided participants with the opportunity to meet and learn from other LGBTQ+ 22 people, which they felt was essential for their academic and social integration. One important 23 way students connected with LGBTQ+ peers was through social media, including LGBTQ+ 24 student Facebook groups, events, and pages:  25 ‘There is the LGBT society Facebook page and everyone who is part of that 26 society is a part of and I sort of friended people via that. I met them in meetings 27 and talked to them...There’s people there that I would never have interacted with 28 otherwise because they're on other courses’ P1, male, gay. 29 By using Facebook pages, participants were able to create new social connections and forge 30 important support networks. LGBTQ+ Facebook groups also provided students with the 31 opportunity to learn what it means to be LGBTQ+ at university, supporting Acciari’s (2015) 32 10  conclusion on the importance of online LGBTQ+ student groups and unions. P2 describes his 1 experience of joining an LGBTQ+ student group on Facebook: 2 ‘I think I was curious to see the population that was there. I had kind of - I had my 3 own curiosities about what being gay at university looked like, because I came 4 from being gay in a workplace and that is very different to the kind of freedoms 5 that you're afforded here’ P2, male, gay. 6 Fox and Ralston (2016) found that LGBTQ+ individuals use social media to learn about their 7 emerging identity. Our findings suggest that this is also true for students, whereby Facebook 8 pages expose them to diverse performances of gender and sexuality, thus facilitating identity 9 development.  10  11 Participants reported that LGBTQ+ visibility in universities was important for their 12 development and transition to university, supporting research that suggests queer visibility 13 creates positive experiences for LGBTQ+ students (Waling & Roffee, 2018). Participants’ 14 statements also signal the important role that social media plays in supporting LGBTQ+ 15 visibility in higher education, by promoting LGBTQ+ student groups and amplifying the 16 voices of LGBTQ+ individuals. 17 ‘I just think like, the visibility, especially in higher education for students, for me 18 anyway, I think it was really important to know that there are other LGBT people 19 around and there are LGBT members of staff’ P11, female, lesbian. 20 Whilst participants felt it was important for LGBTQ+ student groups to be visible, others 21 expressed frustrations that certain groups were only Facebook groups and not active offline: 22  ‘I connected with the LGBT society straight away because I knew that I wanted to 23 be part of it. And that was good, but I think there’s not very much – like, in some 24 LGBT societies there’s not very much happening, so it’s kind of like you’re part of 25 a Facebook group but that’s it’ P14, transgender male, pansexual. 26 It is therefore essential that these groups are not only visible but also active and accessible to 27 all LGBTQ+ students. Whilst these social media groups are useful for students, they are not a 28 direct substitute for offline interaction. Instead, a combination of both in-person and online 29 LGBTQ+ groups would be beneficial. 30  31 Our findings suggest that university provides a ‘stage’ (Morgenroth & Ryan, 2020) where 32 some students engage in diverse performances of gender and sexuality. This stage extends to 33 social media, where students can observe and learn from LGBTQ+ peers. Being able to 34 access these performances is particularly important for first-year students who occupy a 35 liminal state (Turner, 1960), thus aiding their transition to university by facilitating social 36 connection and exploration of identity. 37  38  39 11  3.2  Theme 2. Conceal: ‘You're trying to uphold some kind of 1 fantasy’   2 Some students reported feeling nervous about disclosing their LGBTQ+ identities at 3 university, particularly whilst transitioning to this new environment. Participants who had 4 already come out at home reflected upon the challenges of going through this process again. 5 P6 explains: ‘you’ve got to essentially come out again to a whole new load of people who you 6 don't know’. Therefore, participants’ experiences reflect observations that coming out is not a 7 singular event, but an iterative process (Guittar & Rayburn, 2016). Consequently, some 8 participants reported concealing their LGBTQ+ identities. P2 describes his experience of 9 avoiding an LGBTQ+ student group during the first few weeks of attending university, 10 despite publicly identifying as gay in other settings: 11 ‘like the LGBT society, when I went to the social fair I completely avoided that 12 stand I was like I do not want to be - not associated with it but I don't want to sit 13 there and have that be something that people, if they saw me and looked at me 14 they would be like oh well he....you still have that in the first couple of weeks 15 you’ve got that protective layer about you that you're trying to uphold some kind 16 of fantasy’  P2, male, gay. 17 Here, we see evidence of P2 concealing his sexual identity by performing in a 18 heteronormative manner during the first few weeks of university, actively avoiding anything 19 that could cause an audience to question his sexuality. We are reminded that participants 20 occupied two liminal states (Turner, 1960), whereby they simultaneously adjusted to being a 21 student and being out as LGBTQ+ at university. As a result, participants adjusted their scripts 22 (Morgenroth & Ryan, 2020) to mask LGBTQ+ identities and manage first impressions, 23 perceivably aiding their transition to university. 24  25 These acts extended to online performances, whereby some participants reported 26 intentionally not identifying as LGBTQ+ online. These participants reported intentionally 27 censoring themselves online and avoiding LGBTQ+ groups. P9 explains why she avoided 28 referencing her sexuality in her Facebook profile: 29 ‘It’s first impression isn't it and I think at that age as well, I would have been 18. I 30 was so hung up on making a good first impression, you want everyone to like you 31 and you want to fit in.  You don't know what to expect when you go into University 32 and halls. Those conversations I had with people there was no mention of it ever. I 33 had no reference to it on my profile’ P9, female, gay. 34 These findings suggest that the public-by-default design of Facebook obstructs LGBTQ+ 35 identity expression among students who do not want to be ‘outed2 by the machine’ (Cho, 36 2018), particularly whilst they navigate the new university environment. This could 37 potentially hinder LGBTQ+ students’ transition to university by limiting access to LGBTQ+ 38 information and communities. In other studies, LGBTQ+ people have discussed the 39                                                  2 When a LGBTQ+ person’s sexual orientation or gender identity is disclosed to someone else without their consent (Stonewall, n.d.). 12  importance of Facebook groups being private (e.g. Blackwell et al., 2016), and we also see 1 this reflected in our data. For many, it was vital that LGBTQ+ student groups were private as 2 it enabled them to maintain a ‘buffer’ around their LGBTQ+ identity, allowing them to 3 manage first impressions and gradually come out at university.  4  5 Despite efforts to conceal their identities, there were occasions when participants’ 6 performances were interrupted, and they were demasked on social media. One participant 7 spoke of his experience of being outed as transgender on Facebook: 8 ‘We have this parenting scheme, where a second-year takes on a group of first 9 years. Then they'll make a separate group chat. I didn't use my preferred name - 10 so basically, they had my old name and then they used that and sent it in the group 11 chat to everyone and they all saw my name. Clearly, that's not my name on 12 Facebook’. P7, trans male, heterosexual. 13 This was a distressing experience for P7, causing considerable anxiety. Unfortunately, being 14 outed is a common experience among transgender students (Pryor, 2015). The consequences 15 of being outed can be severe, causing harassment, discrimination, physical violence and 16 mental health issues (Bachman & Gooch, 2018). Universities must consider these issues, and 17 ensure they are equipped to accommodate and support transgender students  18  19 In the context of performance (Morgenroth & Ryan, 2020), the new ‘stage’ of university 20 caused some students to mask LGBTQ+ scripts and act in a manner that was incongruent 21 with their gender and/or sexual identity. This masking also took place on social media, 22 whereby participants censored themselves or avoided connecting with LGBTQ+ student 23 groups through fears of how audiences would perceive them. In relation to digital personhood 24 (Kerrigan & Hart, 2016), participants tried to bind their activities on social media to 25 selectively manage the liminal state of being out at university. Despite students’ efforts to 26 manage their online identities, ‘social media leakage’ sometimes occurred (Kerrigan & Hart, 27 2016), resulting in them being outed and their performances being interrupted. This is 28 especially salient for transgender individuals, who’s past digital performances may continue 29 to exist online alongside their present identities.  30  31 3.3  Theme 3. Protect: ‘Facebook is where relatives live, Facebook 32 is where you’re sensible’ 33 Participants reported feeling unable to perform their authentic LGBTQ+ identities on 34 Facebook. In part, this was due to them being connected to family members and other home 35 contacts who were either unaware of their LGBTQ+ identities or who they were not 36 comfortable viewing authentic performances of gender and/or sexuality. Thus, Facebook was 37 a space where authentic expressions of identity were interrupted. P3 describes how they 38 avoided posting content related to their gender and sexuality on Facebook because they had 39 not yet come out to their family: 40 ‘I’ve got my uncles and cousins who I’m friends with on there, and I don’t think, 41 especially because I'm not out to my parents yet either I'd rather not post loads on 42 there and then my dad is on there as well’ P3, non-binary, bisexual. 43 13  Here, we see evidence of context collapse (boyd, 2002), whereby the social and spatial 1 barriers that usually separate audiences collapsed, thus constraining students’ performances 2 of LGBTQ+ identities. Researchers have found that Facebook provides a space for students 3 and parents to bond, easing the transition to university (Yang, 2018). Whilst it was important 4 for participants to connect with family members on Facebook, many felt they could not 5 express their authentic selves. This could be problematic, given that students who express 6 authentic selves online are less likely to experience loneliness whilst transitioning to 7 university (Thomas et al., 2020); however, for many participants, it was necessary to protect 8 this aspect of their identities.  9  10 Facebook did not afford these participants with the same opportunities for diverse 11 performances of gender and sexuality as in their offline university environments. These 12 participants occupied a liminal state, whereby they were ‘betwixt and between’ (Turner, 13 1960) identifying as LGBTQ+ at university and being closeted at home. To manage context 14 collapse (boyd, 2002), participants displayed different versions of self on Facebook. As P8 15 states: ‘Facebook is where relatives live. Facebook is where you’re sensible and don’t really 16 say anything’. We interpret this as evidence of bounded selves (Kerrigan & Hart, 2016), 17 whereby participants bound a specific version of self to Facebook – one which was often 18 incongruent with their LGBTQ+ identities. 19  20 Participants also expressed concerns about performing a new identity on Facebook that 21 conflicted with past performances. Audiences had been perceived to have made normative 22 assumptions about their identities. These participants had pre-established social norms with 23 their home contacts, which also governed performances of gender and sexuality on Facebook. 24 P8 explains: 25 ‘We had good school days but we no longer exist in each other's worlds and it's 26 weird, and so to suddenly be on Facebook very very gay where these people are, 27 who I don't completely want to go off for sentimental reasons but they're no longer 28 really a part of my life, it would just be alienating and completely weird’ P8, non-29 binary, gay. 30 For these participants, performing an LGBTQ+ identity to their Facebook audiences would 31 be ‘alienating’ because it directly contrasted with existing normative assumptions that had 32 been made about their identities. Similarly, Stephenson-Abetz and Holman (2012) found that 33 students expressed concerns that their new identities would not be accepted by existing social 34 contacts. Given that some participants felt they could not perform their authentic selves on 35 Facebook, they employed various privacy measures to mask their LGBTQ+ identities, 36 including: not tagging themselves in photos; not joining public LGBTQ+ groups or liking 37 LGBTQ+ pages; not posting information related to their LGBTQ+ identity; and, adjusting 38 who could view their posts: 39  40  ‘I had a list on Facebook of the people I’d come out to that hadn’t reacted well, 41 so if I was posting at any stage about my sexuality or my gender identity it would 42 be set so that those people couldn’t see those posts, because I didn’t want to have 43 to interact with them on it’ P13, genderfluid transmasculine, pansexual. 44 14   1 These findings reflect Duguay’s (2016) work, showing that LGBTQ+ young people reinstate 2 contexts on social media by tailoring their performances. Like other groups of LGBTQ+ 3 people (Haimson et al., 2015), some participants reported having multiple Facebook 4 accounts. P2 describes having two Facebook accounts, one which he uses to perform his 5 authentic identity (including his LGBTQ+ identity) and another to perform in a way that he is 6 comfortable showing to his family: 7 ‘This is what I want people seeing if my grandad was like - oh this is what [P2] 8 has been up to.  Then the other one is like the other kinds of things, there isn't 9 anything on there that’s particularly offensive or anything like that or vulgar, but 10 it’s that little bit more of like I can add whoever I want on there and I'm free to be 11 tagged in pictures and that is a different level of comfort’ P2, male, gay. 12 While it was tiring and sometimes distressing for participants to employ these privacy 13 measures, such acts were important as it gave them control over which audiences had access 14 to information about their LGBTQ+ identities. Reflecting upon his two Facebook accounts, 15 P2 said: ‘people have different levels in which they need to be opened up to the idea of me 16 being gay, and social media is a way I can make sure certain doors are open at the right 17 time’. Social media was a valuable tool for participants to manage identity disclosure; 18 however, social media does not always support this need. Facebook emphasises authenticity 19 by insisting on only one account per person and is designed in a way that produces ‘default 20 publicness’ (Cho, 2018; Haimson & Hoffman, 2016). This constrains the performances of 21 LGBTQ+ individuals and increases the volume of work that is required to manage identity 22 disclosure, thereby enhancing the emotional labour of protecting one’s LGBTQ+ status 23 (Hanckel et al., 2019).  24  25 From the narratives presented in this section, we can see that the ‘stage’ (Morgenroth & 26 Ryan, 2020) of Facebook does not always facilitate LGBTQ+ identity performances amongst 27 students. In fact, participants’ performances appear to be bound by the same social norms that 28 govern their offline performances and are further complicated by the design of Facebook’s 29 stage, where social and temporal boundaries collapse and information is public by default 30 (boyd, 2011; Cho, 2018). In the context of digital personhood (Kerrigan & Hart, 2016), we 31 found evidence of temporal selves, whereby participants’ past performances of gender and 32 sexuality (that audiences often interpreted normatively), co-existed alongside their current 33 LGBTQ+ identities despite transitioning to a new state.  34  35 3.4  Theme 4. Express: ‘I feel like my online space is more curated 36 than real life’ 37 Participants discussed seeking out online spaces where they could safely perform their 38 authentic selves whilst at university, reflecting research that has shown LGBTQ+ people feel 39 safe in certain online spaces (Bates et al., 2020; Duguay, 2016). Participants identified two 40 main online spaces where they felt safe: Twitter and Tumblr. Participants found it comforting 41 to turn to Tumblr because it was where they first started to explore their gender and sexuality. 42 P8 states: ‘Tumblr definitely knew I was gay long before my parents did...it was the first place 43 that I was openly myself’. Cavalcante (2019) argued that Tumblr offers an important space 44 for young LGBTQ+ people to interact, test their identities, and become politically motivated, 45 15  by providing a glimpse into a more promising ‘queer utopic’ (p.1732), which is often absent 1 from their offline environments. This finding is also reflected in our data, whereby 2 participants turned to Tumblr to interact, explore, and perform their identities. For example, 3 P8 explains their experience of speaking to fellow LGBTQ+ people on Tumblr who were 4 also transitioning to university life:  5  6 ‘I feel like I was most active on Tumblr around the first time I started university, 7 which was probably partially because that’s what people would talk about within 8 the community I was in. There were quite a few of us who are at that stage in our 9 lives and so we’d talk about the process of moving to university, finding yourself 10 and making your social networks’ P8, non-binary, gay. 11 Participants also felt they were more able to tailor their audiences on Twitter and Tumblr, 12 compared with Facebook and offline. For example, P12 states: ‘I feel like my online space is 13 more curated than real life’. Some participants described Twitter and Tumblr as being less 14 ‘personal’ because they were less likely to engage with home contacts and peers on these 15 platforms: 16  17 “On Twitter, I think I’m more openly than I do on Facebook. I think it’s because 18 I’m a coward. So, if I post Twitter and people respond negatively chances are 19 most of the time it’s people who I don’t know, and I can go “oh it’s fine, it doesn’t 20 matter”. Whereas because everyone I’m friends with on Facebook are people I 21 grew up with or people I’m at university with I think I’d find it more difficult if I 22 got negative reactions” P13, genderfluid transmasculine, pansexual. 23 We understand these platforms as being a key site of demasking for participants, where they 24 could escape their Facebook and offline personas, and safely perform LGBTQ+ identities due 25 to being ‘distanced’ from peers and home contacts. In the context of digital personhood 26 (Kerrigan & Hart, 2016), we interpret this as evidence of participants binding their LGBTQ+ 27 identities in Tumblr and Twitter, which enabled them to manage the liminal states of 28 identifying as LGBTQ+, being out at university, and closeted at home.  29  30 Some participants also reported using Instagram to curate authentic selves. One participant 31 describes his experience of using Instagram to document his gender transition: 32 ‘I think with people on my course seeing stuff that I post on Instagram when I do 33 post about trans related things is very nice, and when I post about, I don’t know, 34 ‘whatever month on testosterone’. I think having people from uni see that and like 35 it and maybe get a bit more knowledge themselves about the process in a 36 roundabout way. Then I feel like that’s positive for them to see that and have a 37 front-row seat of how it happens’.  P14, trans male, pansexual. 38 P14 used social media to bring their experiences to the ‘front stage’ (Goffman, 1959), giving 39 his peers a ‘front-row seat’ where they can be educated about trans issues. This caused P14 to 40 16  feel like he was creating positive changes within his university; however, it placed 1 considerable pressure on P14 and left him feeling like ‘a walking educational resource’. In 2 other research, LGBTQ+ people have reported experiencing a heightened sense of 3 responsibility for others, which they associated with burnout and compassion fatigue 4 (Vaccaro & Meno, 2011). Participants’ experiences echo these findings, whereby cisgender 5 and heterosexual peers’ needs of understanding sometimes took precedence over participants’ 6 emotional exhaustion. Consequently, there is a greater need for universities and wider society 7 to raise awareness and improve education around LGBTQ+ issues, whilst not taking 8 advantage of those within the community. 9  10 Some participants raised concerns about identifying as LGBTQ+ in offline communities but 11 felt they could claim this label online, supporting existing literature (Bargh et al, 2002). P12 12 recalls her experience of attending an LGBTQ+ event and being told not to disclose her 13 bisexual identity: ‘you should never tell anyone that, you should always say that you’re gay. 14 Because if you ever tell anyone that you aren’t a lesbian you’re just going to get rejected, no 15 one will want to hang out with you’.  Much has been written about biphobia and bi-erasure 16 within the LGBTQ+ community. Bisexual people often have their validity questioned, are 17 associated with negative stereotypes, and experience exclusion (Monro, 2015). One non-18 binary participant also faced difficulties finding where they fit within offline communities. 19 Assigned female at birth, they commented ‘I mostly am female-presenting so it's trying to 20 find my space without being imposing’ (P3). However, both participants felt able to identify 21 as their authentic selves on social media, which was both comforting and empowering: 22 ‘I don’t feel like I have a community in, kind of, I want to say - not real life but 23 offline life...I feel like I’m more an online bi because of, I think probably because 24 of that kind of ‘queer enough’ thing, because I’m in a relationship with a guy’ 25 P12, female, bisexual. 26 Whilst social media was a valuable tool for students to enact their authentic selves, 27 performing LGBTQ+ identities online caused many to experience trolling. Transgender 28 participants in particular reported being exposed to negative comments on Twitter. In other 29 studies, transgender people have reported encountering anti-trans people and Trans-30 Exclusionary Radical Feminists in online spaces (Scheuerman, Branham, & Hamidi, 2018). 31 This was also true for participants: 32 ‘This huge amount of hate from, effectively, a faceless group of people on social 33 media being like, ‘you’re disgusting’ ‘you shouldn’t exist’ ‘you’re a danger to 34 society’ or ‘you’re just a really confused person who needs mental health 35 treatment’’. P13, genderfluid transmasculine, pansexual. 36 Previous research has shown that trolling and exposure to negative comments online can 37 negatively affect a person’s mental health and wellbeing (O’Reilly et al., 2018). This was 38 also true for participants who reported that these experiences had detrimental effects on their 39 mental health. LGBTQ+ mental health is disproportionately worse than that of heterosexual 40 and cisgender peers, with over half of LGBTQ+ people experiencing depression and one in 41 eight LGBTQ+ youths attempting suicide (Bachman & Gooch, 2018). Hiding an LGBTQ+ 42 identity to avoid trolling is not a sustainable solution as it too can have a detrimental impact 43 17  on mental health (Meyer, 2003). Universities and designers of social media might consider 1 how they can support LGBTQ+ students and mitigate the impact of these online harms. 2  3 In the context of performance (Morgenroth & Ryan, 2020), the narratives presented in this 4 section indicate that different social media platforms create different stages, which enable 5 different performances of gender and sexuality. Tumblr and Twitter facilitate LGBTQ+ 6 scripts amongst students, by enabling users to curate their audiences and distance themselves 7 from peers and home contacts. The identities presented on these platforms contrasted with the 8 identities they presented on Facebook, supporting the notion that multiple selves co-exist and 9 are bound to specific social media platforms (Kerrigan & Hart, 2016). This contrasts with 10 Turner’s (1960) understanding of liminality, whereby a person is considered to be ‘identity-11 less’ when transitioning to a new state. Instead, these findings suggest that LGBTQ+ students 12 present multiple identities, rather than being identity neutral. 13  14   Conclusions 15 In this study, we explored how LGBTQ+ university students use social media for identity 16 management. We had the secondary aim of examining how LGBTQ+ students use social 17 media to manage their identities whilst transitioning to university life. We approached the 18 narratives of 16 LGBTQ+ students with a social constructionist lens, using theories of 19 performance (Butler, 1988; Morgenroth & Ryan, 2020) and digital personhood (Kerrigan & 20 Hart, 2016) to inform our work. From these interviews, we observed a tension between 21 LGBTQ+ students identifying university as a time for identity expression and exploration, 22 but also needing to protect this aspect of their identities, either from their peers or home 23 contacts.  24  25 We identified that participants occupied multiple liminal states. They simultaneously 26 navigated being out as LGBTQ+ at university, being closeted at home, and transitioning to 27 university life. This tension extended to students’ use of social media, whereby they adopted 28 a ‘strategic outness’ approach (Orne, 2011) to selectively manage their performances of 29 gender and sexuality. Because certain platforms such as Facebook produce information that is 30 public-by-default (Cho, 2018), LGBTQ+ students employed various protective strategies to 31 manage their online performances and liminal states. This included: self-censorship; not 32 tagging themselves in certain photos; not joining LGBTQ+ students groups or liking 33 LGBTQ+ pages; not posting information related to their LGBTQ+  identities; adjusting their 34 privacy settings; creating multiple accounts; seeking out online spaces where they felt they 35 could express their authentic selves. It took considerable effort for participants to consistently 36 manage their online performances, and whilst this was frustrating, it was necessary for them 37 to feel safe and reduce the likelihood of experiencing discrimination. 38  39 In the context of performance (Morgenroth & Ryan, 2020), we found evidence that the 40 ‘stage’ of university was generally supportive of LGBTQ+ ‘scripts’, facilitating identity 41 exploration and development; however, some students did feel the need to mask LGBTQ+ 42 scripts, particularly whilst transitioning to university. Importantly, we found that social media 43 provided stages where students observed and learnt from LGBTQ+ scripts and created new 44 social connections. These online experiences were vital in supporting participants’ 45 experiences of university and aiding their transition to the university environment. The stage 46 of Facebook was particularly problematic for LGBTQ+ students because of context collapse 47 (boyd, 2002), whereby audiences comprised home and university contacts who were not 48 18  always aware of participants’ LGBTQ+ identities. Consequently, the same social norms that 1 governed offline performances also limited performances on Facebook. These findings 2 develop contemporary frameworks for understanding gender and sexuality (Morgenroth & 3 Ryan, 2020) by applying them to online performances.  4  5 We found that other social media stages such as Tumblr and Twitter facilitated more diverse 6 scripts of gender and sexuality, by allowing students to tailor their audiences and distance 7 themselves from home contacts. This reflects Hanckel et al.’s (2019) finding that LGBTQ+ 8 young people identified online spaces that were ‘for them’ and ‘not for them’, and provides 9 evidence of bounded selves existing on social media (Kerrigan & Hart, 2016), whereby 10 students bound different identities to different platforms to manage their liminal states. In 11 addition to being visible on Facebook, LGBTQ+ student groups could use alternative social 12 media spaces where students may feel more comfortable performing their LGBTQ+ 13 identities. In turn, this could aid students’ transition to university. 14  15 Turner (1960) frames a person as being identity-neutral during transitions, as though they are 16 neither the past identity nor the new identity. However, our findings suggest that LGBTQ+ 17 students present multiple identities rather than being identity neutral, reflecting prior work 18 conducted with LGBTQ+ groups (Haimson, 2018). Thus, LGBTQ+ students’ online 19 identities are multiple, situated, and bound to specific platforms. This supports Haimson’s 20 (2018) observation about the importance of ‘social media site separation’. In the case of 21 LGBTQ+ students, separation between social media platforms appears necessary to express 22 different identities, which is particularly important when transitioning to university life. In an 23 increasingly connected world, we recommend that designers also consider the importance of 24 separation for people with stigmatised identities and the ethical implications of enabling 25 connectivity across social media. 26  27 Our findings have important implications for the social media stages upon which 28 performances of LGBTQ+ identities take place. The ‘public-by-default’ design of Facebook 29 (Cho, 2018) appears to limit students’ expressions of LGBTQ+ identities, which in turn could 30 limit access to certain information and communities that could support their transition to 31 university and enhance wellbeing. It is clear from our interviews, that a static and fully public 32 approach to identity is not appropriate for LGBTQ+ students. In fact, consistently managing 33 social media performances was emotionally demanding for participants, reflecting Hanckel et 34 al.’s (2019) work with LGBTQ+ young people. Like Haimson and Hoffman (2016), we 35 recommend that designers focus on promoting flexible and fluid expressions of identity. This 36 will benefit LGBTQ+ students who occupy liminal states, by potentially aiding their 37 transition to university and identity development. Designers should seek to challenge 38 normative designs and create easy-to-use systems that give LGBTQ+ students (and other 39 LGBTQ+ groups) control over who has access to what information and when. Importantly, 40 we recommend that the voices of LGBTQ+ students are centred in the development of social 41 media, to create innovative designs that promote autonomy, inclusivity, and fluid expressions 42 of identity. 43  44 Our study has some limitations. Firstly, recruiting from LGBTQ+ student Facebook groups 45 may have biased our sample to individuals who were comfortable identifying as LGBTQ+ or 46 were engaged with these groups. This may explain why participants tended to focus on 47 Facebook and why discussions of specifically queer platforms were notably absent from the 48 data. In the future, researchers could explore how LGBTQ+ students use these platforms and 49 contrast it with expressions of self on other social media. 50 19   1 We also focused on the LGBTQ+ student community as a whole, meaning intersections of 2 identity (e.g. race) were not explored. This also resulted in the experiences of transgender 3 students being conflated with LGB+ experiences. Previous research has shown that 4 transgender people face heightened risks (Bachmann & Gooch, 2018), and our findings 5 suggest that transgender students have distinct experiences of using social media, facing 6 challenges related to temporal selves (Kerrigan & Hart, 2016). We therefore recommend that 7 future work focuses specifically on transgender student experiences. Finally, university is 8 only one context that LGBTQ+ people exist in; therefore, future work could focus on how 9 LGBTQ+ students transition to new contexts after university and the role that social media 10 plays in negotiating these transitions. 11  12 In conclusion, LGBTQ+ students use social media to explore, conceal, protect, and express 13 their identities. LGBTQ+ students face distinct challenges when transitioning to university 14 life and social media both helps and hinders this transition. LGBTQ+ students’ online 15 identities are multiple, situated, and bound to specific platforms, with some alternatives to 16 Facebook offering a space where students may feel more comfortable performing their 17 authentic selves. Importantly, like other LGBTQ+ groups (Kitzie, 2018) our findings show 18 that LGBTQ+ students are not passive users of social media. Instead, they are active agents 19 who negotiate performances of identity with the tools they have available. We recommend 20 that designers centre the voices of LGBTQ+ students to develop social media that are safe, 21 inclusive, and celebratory of LGBTQ+ identities. In turn, this could promote LGBTQ+ 22 student wellbeing and aid their transition to university. 23  24  25  26  27 1  References  Acciara, L (2015) Education beyond the straight and narrow – LGBT students’ experiences in higher education @ NUS Connect.

    "abstract": "Social media can be used to both enhance and diminish students’ experiences of university and its influence is strong for LGBTQ+ people facing stigma and discrimination. Students may feel exposed when identifying as LGBTQ+, particularly whilst transitioning to university life. In this study, we used theories of performance and digital personhood to explore how LGBTQ+ students use social media for identity management. We report a thematic analysis of 16 interviews. Four themes were generated from the data, showing that students use social media to explore, conceal, protect, and express their identities. We found that different social media provide stages where LGBTQ+ identities are constrained by different and distinctive social factors. Thus, LGBTQ+ students’ online identities are multiple, situated, and bound to specific platforms, with some alternatives to Facebook offering a space where students may feel more comfortable performing their authentic selves",
