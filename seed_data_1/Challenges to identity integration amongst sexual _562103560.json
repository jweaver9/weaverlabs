This hasimplications on services predicated on identity affiliationwhich may potentially exclude the needs of hidden andintersectionally disadvantaged populations.K E YWORD Sidentity threat, intergroup relations, intersectionality, Muslims,Whiteness1 | INTRODUCTIONSince the Stonewall riots in the US and the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the UK a half-century ago, therehas been gradual societal acceptance of homosexuality (Curtice, Clery, Perry, Phillips, & Rahim, 2019) in Westerncontexts. This has been enshrined in UK legislation with the Civil Partnership Act 2004, Equalities Act 2010, andMarriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Nevertheless, this wider societal acceptance may not be reflected in the livesof all sexual minorities nor within socially marginalised communities.In the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL-3), 11.5% of British women and 8% of Britishmen reported having a same-sex sexual experience (Mercer et al., 2013), yet only approximately 2% of the UK popu-lation self-identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (Office for National Statistics, 2018a). This difference highlights a dis-tinction between sexual orientation, sexual attraction, sexual identity, and sexual behaviour. One potentialexplanation might be perceived negative consequences of “coming-out”, e.g. family rejection, detrimental impacts onfamily reputation or, in extreme cases, honour-based violence (Khan & Lowe, 2020; Kumpaso\u0002glu, Hasdemir, & Canel-Çınarbaş, 2020). This distinction between behaviour and identity may be particularly felt by ethnic and religiousminorities (Balaji et al., 2012; Carrillo & Hoffman, 2016). Accordingly, it is important to understand potential chal-lenges to positive identity integration amongst minorities at the intersection of sexual, religious, and ethnicidentities.1.1 | Theoretical frameworksSocial identity theories offer an analytical lens to understand how individuals conceptualise and affiliate with differ-ent identities. Tajfel and Turner (1979) proposed that individuals are psychologically motivated to hold positive socialidentities. Furthermore, social group memberships can positively impact well-being through providing a sense ofbelonging, comfort, meaning, and purpose (Jetten, Haslam, & Haslam, 2015; Mitha & Adatia, 2016). Nevertheless,identifying with groups perceived less positively in society can have harmful social and well-being outcomes(DeMarco & Newheiser, 2019). An individual's group memberships may not always be compatible with one another,and potential conflict can inhibit identification, social connection, and support from either or both groups (Hamblin &Gross, 2013).Intersectionality theory, therefore, recognises the complexity of minority identities and proposes that individualsmay face multiple levels of oppression and discrimination (Crenshaw, 1991). Collins (2004) notes “race, class, gender,sexuality, [and] ethnicity [are] mutually constructing systems of power…[and] untangling their effects in any given750 MITHA ET AL.situation…remains difficult” (11). Moreover, identity is complex and fluid, with multiple overlapping realities thatcoexist and impact upon how one's identity is visible and perceived by others, which can influence experienced prej-udice. Even if an individual may feel their identities to be compatible, this may not be how they are perceived byothers (e.g., Hopkins & Greenwood, 2013). Individuals who experience social oppression may consequently changetheir behaviour to de-emphasise aspects of their identity, use strategies such as performativity to consolidate or rein-force their membership to the ingroup, or opt to create their own social ingroups as an identity enhancement strat-egy (Branscombe, Schmitt, & Harvey, 1999; Koc, Sahin, & Anderson, 2021).Intersectionality and identity theories are crucial to understanding the experiences of sexual minority people ofcolour (POC). The mainstream LGBTQ+ community, though portrayed as inclusive, may actually create anunwelcoming space for sexual minority POC due to its hegemonic Whiteness and occurrences of racism (Han, 2007;Jaspal, 2017; Jones, 2016). Indeed, the movement to add black and brown stripes to the Pride flag in the UK, as agesture of inclusivity, was met with some backlash (Baggs, 2019). Sexual minority POC may feel pressured to “comeout” and “assimilate” into the “scene”, which may not be appropriate or viable options for them (Jivraj, Tauqir, & deJong, 2003; Kehl, 2020). Moreover, sexual minority POC may struggle with reconciling social representations ofLGBTQ+ culture with views from within their religious, ethnic, and cultural communities. They may experience inter-nal and external homophobia and discrimination (Cyrus, 2017), leading them to question just in which communitythey belong (Bagci et al., 2020; Ghabrial, 2017), which can have psychological implications.1.2 | Sexual minority identity constructionSome research has explored the experiences of minority LGBTQ+ people (i.e., non-White, non-middle class). Barrettand Pollack (2005) discuss the hegemonic construction of mainstream LGBTQ+ spaces within the context of work-ing-class men in America, finding class distinctions rendered a distancing from “gay” identity and “community” dueto feelings of non-belonging. Additional complexities are seen when considering racialisation. Finlinson, Col\u0003on,Robles, and Soto (2006) found a distancing regarding a “gay identity” amongst Puerto Rican working-class men whohave sex with men (MSM), where masculinity was constructed depending on one's sexual role. Thing (2010) notedelements of hybridity amongst self-identified gay men in Los Angeles where identities were dependent on sexualrole and social class. The phenomenon of heterosexual identification despite homosexual behaviour has been dis-cussed in the literature in relation to the “down-low”, which has predominantly been examined within African-American and Latino communities in America (e.g., Martinez & Hosek, 2005). Whilst some work has examined same-sex behaviour within Muslim communities globally (e.g., Murray & Roscoe, 1997), extant work on British Muslimshas tended to frame “coming out” as an identity-affirming strategy, not critically interrogating reasons why this maynot be desirable or possible. Indeed, some scholars of colour dispute binaries of “outness” versus “closeted”,recognising these dichotomies may exclude sexual minority POC (Boussalem, 2020).Whilst there has been increased media visibility of sexual minority British Muslim South Asians, shedding lightonto an oft-hidden population, many within this group may not find affinity with these representations or feel com-fortable rendering visible their sexual orientation, opting for more “discreet” lives, feeling it safer to move amongsthidden communities (Kesvani, 2019). Accordingly, we aim to examine identity processes among these sexual minorityBritish South Asian Muslim men.1.3 | Muslims in BritainMuslims comprise approximately 5% of the UK population (Office for National Statistics, 2018b), with nearly halfborn in the UK and two-thirds being of South Asian descent (Muslim Council of Britain, 2015). As a community, theyexperience multiple social disadvantage including poorer attainment in educational settings, lower levels ofMITHA ET AL. 751employment, poorer health, and largely live in deprived and disadvantaged geographies (Muslim Council ofBritain, 2015). The British media has positioned British Muslims as a threat vis-à-vis the White British majority, forexample, framing Muslim men in the context of “Asian sex gangs”, being overly patriarchal and misogynistic towomen, being involved in criminal gangs and as a “fifth column” whose values are positioned as anathema to “Britishvalues” (e.g., Frondigoun et al., 2007; Jaspal & Cinnirella, 2010). This juxtaposition is particularly seen in discourse oninclusion and tolerance, positioning Muslim views vis-à-vis LGBTQ+ rights. Puar (2013) argues that LGBTQ+ rightsare framed within a discourse of “progressiveness” and thus adopted as part of “national values” regarding equality.Religious and ethnic minority communities who do not adopt this approach are therefore portrayed as being against“progressive national values”. This type of framing was seen in the UK context during the Birmingham LGBTQ+teaching controversy, prompted by proposed changes to the English relationships and sex education curriculumwhich were to include teaching about LGBTQ+ relationships. There were protests at schools in Birmingham bymembers of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian religious conservative groups. When reporting on this controversy, how-ever, the media portrayal was largely framed as “Muslim groups opposing equal rights”. This narrative, however,ignored concerns from other religious minorities, and the curriculum itself being linked to controversial counter-terrorism measures placing young Muslims under scrutiny. Moreover, this type of polarised discourse, seen in anumber of countries and contexts, replicates Orientalist and assimilationist thinking, in that non-Western culturesare viewed as lacking Western ideas about sexual orientation identity and visibility, with religious communitiesviewed as not “progressive”, and with sexual minorities within religious communities pressed to “come out” and be“liberated” (Heimer, 2020; Massad, 2007). This also erases identities which do not use Western conceptualisationsregarding visibility of sexual orientation identity. Overall, these social representations can increase feelings ofmarginalisation amongst those at the intersection of multiple minority groups.1.4 | Sexual minority MuslimsFor sexual minority Muslims, the salience of religious identity along with stigma attached to non-heterosexualitywithin their religio-cultural community may present an internal conflict in reconciling religious and cultural identitieswith a sexual orientation identity (Koc et al., 2021). Traditional interpretations of Islamic religious scripture view sexoutwith the confines of heterosexual marriage to be sinful and/or forbidden (Siraj, 2011). That said, as with adher-ents of other religious traditions, what is religiously prescriptive may not reflect practice in reality. As with other sex-ual minority POC, living on the “down-low” may facilitate reconciling sexual orientation with living within patriarchalcultures with prescriptive roles on gender and masculinity (Eslen-Ziya & Koc, 2016) and may help with avoiding prej-udice or negative social consequences. While alternative interpretations regarding homosexuality and Islam haveemerged (e.g., Kugle, 2010), these are not representative of mainstream Muslim views (Gallup, 2009; IpsosMORI, 2018; Siraj, 2009) where sexual mores are conservative and adherence to collective kinship trumps individualidentity (Siraj, 2009; Yip, 2004). Extant research (e.g., Jaspal & Cinnirella, 2010) suggests that amongst sexual minor-ity British Muslims potential identity conflicts may exist regarding religious and sexual orientation identity, and vari-ous strategies and processes may be employed to navigate these. This may include performativity of heterosexualidentity (Jaspal & Siraj, 2011) or selective disclosure of sexual orientation identity (Siraj, 2011). Additionally, self-stigma, internalised homophobia, and feelings of shame often are seen with respondents viewing their homosexualityas a “test” or punishment requiring penance (Afzal, 2014).1.5 | Aims of the present studySince the seminal works regarding British Muslim non-heterosexuals (Jaspal & Cinnirella, 2010; Siraj, 2009;Yip, 2004), there have been broader societal changes regarding inclusion of sexual minorities in mainstream British752 MITHA ET AL.society. Contemporaneously, social stigmatisation towards Muslims has increased, alongside a dearth of dedicatedsupport groups for sexual minority British Muslims (i.e., Bassi, 2008). This leads to a lacuna of research investigatinghow sexual minority British South Asian Muslims have responded to increasing societal sexual minority visibility onthe one hand and increased Islamophobia on the other, thus having different manifestations of their selves pittedagainst each other in the public discourse. This study, therefore, aims to examine identity construction amongst sex-ual minority British Muslim South Asian men within this context, using an intersectional approach which has largelybeen missing from the literature.2 | METHODS2.1 | ParticipantsThirty-eight self-identified British Muslim men of South Asian heritage were recruited from London (79%) and Scot-land (21%). Participants' ages ranged from 18–37 (M: 26.5, SD: 4.3) and participants' ethnic backgrounds werePakistani (71%), Bangladeshi (13%), and other South Asian (16%). Just over a quarter of participants were students,with another quarter in professional occupations; the remainder were in low-paid/low-skilled jobs or chose not todisclose their occupation.2.2 | RecruitmentBritish Muslim South Asian men were recruited to discuss their experiences being Muslim and attracted to the same-sex, being mindful of negative connotations regarding sexual orientation labels within the community (Siraj, 2009),and thus facilitated obtaining respondents who may not necessarily have adhered to a sexual orientation identity, incontrast to previous work in the area (e.g., Jaspal & Cinnirella, 2010). The study employed a qualitative methodology,following the approach established by previous authors (e.g., Jaspal & Cinnirella, 2010; Kesvani, 2019), recruitingparticipants through snowball sampling via gatekeepers and their social networks (Koc, 2016).2.3 | ProcedureAs “outing” was a concern for many respondents, interviews were conducted in a manner most amenable for them,for example, in-person, telephone, or online. These approaches have been previously established in research withsimilar populations (McKeown, Nelson, Anderson, Lowd, & Elford, 2010; Siraj, 2016). This decision was pragmaticdue to some respondents' reluctance to meet in-person (due to fear of being recognised by someone they knew) andthe greater degree of anonymity afforded by telephone/online interviews to discuss sensitive topics (McKeownet al., 2010). Respondents were assured their identities would remain anonymous; therefore, pseudonyms are used.The interviewer was male and from a similar religio-cultural background to respondents. The implications ofresearchers holding insider/outsider perspectives have been explored previously (e.g., Abbas, 2010; Siraj, 2012b). Inthis study, the shared religio-cultural background may have been beneficial in the interviewing process, for example,in terms of shared knowledge and understanding of religio-cultural terminology and social norms/behaviours. Thatsaid, many respondents were guarded in their responses, possibly fearing disclosure within their communities.Indeed, those who were not interviewed in-person seemed more open and forthright, suggesting a greater degree ofcandour facilitated by degrees of anonymity afforded by the alternative interviewing modalities.Interviews lasted between one to two hours and were unstructured, loosely based around a broad topic guidecentred around the following topics: awareness of sexual attraction, experiences in developing social supportMITHA ET AL. 753networks, religion, sexuality and religio-cultural expectations. Respondents preferred not to be audio-recorded,reflecting their fear of potential disclosure, thus transcripts were developed from field notes. While this study is notmeant to generalise to all sexual minority Muslims, it gives greater insight into a population group who may experienceintersectional disadvantage (Rahman, 2010) and may not necessarily engage with gay-affirmative spaces (Siraj, 2011).2.4 | AnalysisData were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, as outlined in Jaspal (2020) and Braun and Clarke (2006,2019). Analysis was iterative, and all authors were involved in the coding process. An intersectional lens was used asa framework to understand respondents' lived experiences. The authors used a reflexive approach, examining theirown positionality with respect to the data. Codes were collated to generate the themes. Presented quotes areparticipants' own words, with clarification added in square brackets.3 | FINDINGSAnalysis of respondents' narratives revealed the complexities in identity construction and integration. Their sexualidentity was situated against their socio-cultural context and participants often conflated religion and culture. Themain themes are discussed below.3.1 | Degrees of “Outness”Respondents' experiences of being “out”, or public in their sexual orientation identity, varied with age. There was a ten-dency for younger respondents to mention greater degrees of outness – to themselves, friends or family – while olderrespondents were less likely to disclose to others. Participants reflected on the potential benefits or disadvantages of“coming out” while also negotiating their relationships to their communities and their reputation; indeed, while older par-ticipants may have internalised and acknowledged their sexual orientation, they largely noted no positive benefit disclos-ing it to others. One factor influencing “outness” was whether or not respondents lived independently, which influencedwhether they felt they had to conceal their sexual orientation to protect against perceived judgement, ostracisation, andfamilial reputational damage within the community. Perzad (mid-20s), describing his use of gay dating apps, stated:…as if I would use it back home….I'd be too shit scared to use it in [hometown], in case I knew someonethere. If you thought the aunties didn't have anything to talk about already!Being geographically distanced from his community, by living away from his family and community, facilitatedbeing able to explore his sexuality without fear or judgement from others, such as “aunties”, that is, older women inthe community who are felt to have a tendency to gossip and be disparaging about others within the community.Respondents who lived nearer to their families were selective to whom they disclosed their sexual orientation, if atall. From an identity perspective, this reflects an element of selecting one's own ingroup – developing a network ofindividuals to whom disclosure helps affirm one's identity. For many, community social reputation was paramount inthe decision regarding disclosure:Being out affects your reputation so I chicken out when I think about it. It takes guts. It's not very common…. It's just being scared of reputation, innit? People over-simplify [coming out] but it ain't easy (Haroon,early 30s).754 MITHA ET AL.Others felt they had no choice but to conceal their sexual orientation identity as the social cost of “coming out”was too high. Ibrahim (mid-20s) commented:I'm not out because I'm afraid. I'm afraid of losing my family if they find out. It's not about finance, it'sabout belonging and love.Thus, the potential loss of social support and belonging from one's family warranted being selective about thedisclosure of their sexual orientation identity. Similar issues regarding non-disclosure of culturally taboo experiencesdue to perceived loss of familial support have been explored in the literature (e.g., Jaspal, 2014a; Mirza, 2017).Some respondents were protective of their individual choice regarding disclosure:“It's a personal matter…I don't have to explain it to anyone”. (Chihangeer; mid-20s).In this sense, choosing not to disclose may have been empowering. Framing disclosure as a personal choice, andnot feeling the need to justify it, may have given a sense of agency and control. Unfortunately, for some, the choiceregarding disclosure had been taken away from them and this had negative repercussions. Sadru (mid-30s) reporteda family member had discovered his non-heterosexuality and “I was going to be disowned…”, articulating the risksmany felt they faced, of abandonment by their friends and family. Others who chose to tell their family also experi-enced negative reactions:My family didn't deal with it all that great but I think it's getting better… My mother is quite in denialabout the whole situation. She's still convinced that I'm not fully gay (Parvez, early 20s).Some respondents noted that concealing their sexual orientation identity enabled them to meet expectationsplaced on them (i.e., heterosexual marriage):Coming out would hurt my parents. Why would I hurt them? Maybe I'm hurting my wife and kids more[by engaging in clandestine sexual encounters with men] but I see no need to come out (Reyhan, late 30s).Although engaging in same-sex sexual activity while married to an opposite-sex partner was viewed nega-tively by some respondents, there was also a recognition of marriage being a religio-cultural obligation. Forexample, Faheem (late 20s), who identified as a gay Muslim, stated: “Of course I have to get married [to awoman], it's just a matter of when”. There was an inherent conflict in this because it required explicitly or pri-vately acknowledging their sexual orientation vis-à-vis religio-cultural expectations. Opposite-sex marriagewas seen as inevitable, tied to the Islamic concept of “din” (i.e., an Arabic term generally understood to referto an Islamic religious “way of life”, character, morals, etc., which a Muslim person will be accountable for inthe afterlife):I need to complete my din and get married [to a woman]… My mother feels that she has to fulfil her obliga-tion to get her sons married…I [will] feel a failure if I don't get married. Well, everyone will [feel they failedand that I'm a failure]…. And when they [family] present the info of: good girl, Muslim, good family, live[s]in [the] UK with a good job, then I have no excuse but to see how it goes … I do feel part of my duty to fol-low through [with marrying a woman] (Zaf, early 30s).Zaf notes the substantial pressure he faces – internally, through his own desire to meet his perceived religiousobligations, and externally, through the anticipated reactions of his family if he did not meet these obligations. Thiswas spoken of in terms of collective shame, where his failure to get married would bring shame upon his family. TheMITHA ET AL. 755importance of keeping family and community reputation above individual wants and to avoid collective shame wasnoted by other respondents. For instance, Shahid (mid 20s) notes:As long as I can keep my parents happy, I'm happy to live the way I'm living. My [own] happiness doesn'tmatter.As per Zaf's account, opposite-sex marriage was viewed in terms of a “match” based on the socio-demographicsof a prospective spouse, with no mention of sexual or romantic attraction. Rather, marriage was viewed by respon-dents as a duty based on the Islamic concept of sunnah (i.e., traditional Islamic practices and customs as outlined/exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad).This dilemma between religio-cultural obligations and individual sexual preference was noted by many respon-dents and echoes previous findings by Jaspal (2012, 2014a). Respondents here used various adaptation strategies;for example, getting married to women and then getting divorced, entering into marriages of convenience, or gettingmarried to women while continuing to engage in clandestine sexual encounters with men. Interestingly, the religiousimplications of committing zina (sexual activity outwith marriage) were not raised by respondents. Therefore, itseems the identity threat created by marriage was not really rooted in religion as such, but intertwined with ethnicidentity pressures and a desire to be seen to publicly adhere to religio-cultural expectations, that is, religiousperformativity, due to cultural concepts of izzat, that is, the concept of collective honour/prestige/reputation inSouth Asian and Muslim cultures.It is worth noting for many respondents “being out” did not necessarily mean being public with their sexual ori-entation identity, but self-acknowledging their sexual orientation – thus they could be “out” to themselves but notothers. Cheah and Singaravelu (2017) noted “coming-out” starts with self-acceptance, followed by selective disclo-sure and concealment, though some of their participants saw homosexuality in behavioural terms which did notnecessitate public disclosure. Therefore, for some, varying one's degree of “outness” may not always be indicative ofinternalised sexual prejudice (Wilkerson, Smolenski, Brady, & Rosser, 2012) but might be a protective identity man-agement strategy (Cheah & Singaravelu, 2017). The social value placed on family reputation management and itsinfluence on disclosure reflects cultural norms of reputation within honour-based cultures (Cross et al., 2014;Mirza, 2017).Overall, it seemed that choosing one's degree of outness was a protective identity management strategy. Partici-pants' performance, visibility and identification of their sexual orientation were done within a context of beingcognisant of perceptions of others within their religio-cultural ingroup. That said, intergroup processes also played arole, as will be discussed in the next theme.3.2 | Hegemonic Whiteness and the LGBTQ+ communityRespondents largely felt socially excluded from LGBTQ+ spaces. For example, Behrooz (early 20s) commented: “thegay scene in general is mostly focused on White people”. Respondents related experiences of discrimination, for exam-ple, Hafiz (late teens), despite being British-born and having a distinct regional accent, noted when entering LGBTQ+ spaces:When they see my face it's like they expect me to speak with an Indian accent or something. Nothingwrong with it if I did, but I don't.Abbas (mid-20s) noted experiences of being “Other-ed” and implicit (and explicit) racism in LGBTQ+ spaces:“…here people are racist, they are implicitly racist. They just look at you and you know. You feel out of place”.756 MITHA ET AL.This racial stereotyping and subsequent lack of belonging is a common experience amongst POC sexual minori-ties (Jivraj et al., 2003; Jones, 2016; Kehl, 2020). This experienced lack of belonging may have been internalised andfostered an element of distancing. For instance, some respondents noted feeling discomfort when entering main-stream gay-affirmative spaces:White guys are too open. That's good for them but I'm not really interested in what they do. If I see gay orlesbian people holding hands or being affectionate in public I think it's sweet for them to feel comfortablewith each other in public whereas I'd feel uncomfortable displaying any PDA [public display of affection] in[the] public eye… I do go to Soho sometimes with mates but I'm definitely not comfortable going to thebars there. I go, then I'm out shortly after. It's too full on for my liking, with go-go dancers and tight spaces.Pride is definitely not for me. Definitely have a phobia, if you call it, of the out and proud lot(Zaf, early 30s).This quote suggests societal changes which have enabled people within the mainstream LGBTQ+ community to becomfortable and confident in the visibility of their sexual orientation identity do not necessarily apply to sexual minorityPOC, who may not have the privilege to do so. Zaf's quote highlights a lack of belonging in these spaces for sexual minor-ity POC, but also a distinct feeling of discomfort or fear about being visibly “out”, which may be linked with social costsassociated with disclosure. This felt exclusion was reflected in respondents' negative perceptions of gay-affirmativespaces, with Shahid (mid 20s) referring to them as “scatty places” based on what was perceived as social norms regardingpromiscuity in “gay culture”. Hafiz (late teens) stated “White guys are total slags”. Riaz (early 20s) stated:Gays may be slutty and gross but that doesn't mean they are incapable of being in love or settling downand starting a family etc. It's just a cultural norm.Thus, while Riaz acknowledged promiscuity as an embedded cultural marker within the “gay community”, he alsonoted a possibility of adhering to heteronormative expectations (e.g., “settling down and starting a family”) but witha same-sex partner. Riaz's point is particularly striking when contrasted to other respondents – he was one of thefew respondents to acknowledge a sexual orientation identity but was from a middle-class background and thus hisexperiences ran in stark contrast to other respondents from working-class backgrounds. His account thereforereflects how privilege influences acknowledging and engaging with a “gay identity”.Respondents also noted negative experiences when trying to develop friendships and romantic relationshipswith White sexual minority men. Abbas (mid-20s) recounted:If you meet a [White] guy, most of the time if you give a name they'd be like “don't give me a name, I don'twant to know”. A name makes a person real. And there's no real people in this game. You're just a number,a body: body 1, body 2, body 3. It's all about getting f***ed as much as you can.He also felt that in “gay culture”, monogamous relationships, a social norm within his religio-cultural community,were largely absent.When interpreted via the perspective of social identity theory, participants seemed to distance themselves fromthe mainstream, highlighting their distinctiveness, perhaps as a response to social exclusion. Experiences of not beingfelt to conform to the “gay ideal” (i.e., White, tall, tanned, muscular) also influenced perceptions of belonging,through experiences of social rejection which impacted self-esteem. For example, Nadeem (early 20s) notes:Guys aren't as interested in me as I'm chubby and [do] not [have] the perfect body [type] the gay worldlikes to idolise (Nadeem, early 20s).MITHA ET AL. 757Here, Nadeem notes not adhering to the “idealised gay body”, and being “chubby” and South Asian hefelt would not be seen as attractive by other gay men. Thus, social exclusion from the mainstream LGBTQ+“community” was based on his non-conformance to the dominant social representation of what a gay man“should” look like. Whilst most of the research in relation to body image and belonging to the gay “scene”has focused on White LGBTQ+ people, lack of belonging due to body image has also been found to occuramongst sexual minority POC who experience additional stressors based on social representations of mascu-linity and social desirability (Brennan et al., 2013; Bhambhani, Flynn, Kellum, & Wilson, 2019), as will be dis-cussed in the following theme.3.3 | Internalisation of White hegemonyAs explored in the previous theme, participants noted social devaluation of their ethnic and religious background bythe mainstream LGBTQ+ community. As South Asian sexual minority Muslim men, they were a visible “Other” inLGBTQ+ spaces and therefore held less social and cultural capital compared to White LGBTQ+ individuals. Never-theless, the manifestation of Whiteness as superior may have been internalised which affected how respondentsinteracted with other sexual minority men. Some respondents stated their sexual preference for White partners anda lack of attraction to others from their ethnic group, being quite pejorative of those from their own ethno-culturalingroup.Some respondents took this a step further by self-identifying as another ethnic group more proximal to White-ness, by identifying as “mixed race” or claiming they were from another ethnic group. When prompted further, itseemed they were appropriating another ethnic/racial identity or purposely conflating their ethnic group with theirnationality (which would be perceived as “White”, such as Scottish). For example, Rahim (early 20s) stated: “I'dclassify myself as mixed. I'm half White, half Arab” but later revealed “I'm actually Pakistani. Everyone wants to beArab. I really want to”. Rahim's claim of being “mixed…half White, half Arab” when he was really Pakistani demon-strates an internalisation of sexual discrimination and racialised hierarchies in desirability. South Asians claiming tobe “mixed” or Arab, as more proximal to Whiteness, may render them as being more desirable and afford greaterlevels of privilege within the LGBTQ+ community. The use of these strategies is not surprising considering White-ness is held as the “standard” within the LGBTQ+ community (Daroya, 2018; Han, 2007). These comments alsoreflect race-based sexual stereotypes and views of masculinity and desirability manifested hierarchically, withsome ethnicities portrayed as more desirable than others. For example, in LGBTQ+ spaces Arabs tend to beviewed as hyper-masculine and the active sexual partner, with Asians viewed as effeminate and passive. There-fore, respondents choosing to identify as Middle Eastern or Arab could reflect a desire to portray themselves in amore sexually desirable manner and render distance from racialised stereotypes of their own ethnic ingroup. Issuesaround sexual racism and fetishisation have been explored previously (e.g., Callander, Newman, & Holt, 2015;Han, 2007).Interestingly, while Babak (early 20s) identified as: “half Arab, half White”, he later admitted “okay, I'm reallyPakistani but I do not say I'm South Asian because I'm discreet and because there are other [South] Asians [around] so Ijust say I'm Middle Eastern”. Here, Babak appeared to appropriate a different ethnic identity to ensure another layerof discretion that would protect him from identification by ethnic ingroup members.Overall, it was paradoxical that respondents seemed to portray themselves in greater proximity to Whiteness,while also being disparaging about White gay culture and heightening their distinctiveness from that social groupusing derogatory language. In terms of identity management, if an individual does not feel included or accepted bya group, self-group distancing might be viewed as a useful coping strategy because the individual does not need todeal with negative stereotypes of the ingroup or rejection. However, this may result in isolation (Jettenet al., 2015) and undermine group belonging and other benefits ingroup identification provides (Bourguignonet al., 2020).758 MITHA ET AL.3.4 | Distancing from the sexual minority religio-cultural ingroupWhile it might be anticipated that negative experiences and exclusion from the mainstream LGBTQ+ communitywould result in respondents seeking greater affiliation amongst sexual minorities within their own religio-culturalingroup, this was not apparent across all respondents. Changez (late 20s) felt interacting with people from hisingroup was “safer” than those from the mainstream LGBTQ+ community who he viewed as more promiscuous andopen about their sexual orientation identity.Others seemed to suggest a sense of superiority over those who were not visible about their sexual orientationidentity. Rustam (mid-20s) referred to the “backward culture” and “lack of education” amongst those within hisingroup, which, in his view, caused people to hide their sexual orientation and marry opposite-sex partners. Others,such as Wafi (mid 20s), noted “it's a problem with their mentality…their parents came from villages, so…they have notdeveloped as much as they should have”. These views suggest a degree of internalised assimilationist prejudice anddistancing from their own ingroup and implied superiority due to adherence to “progressive” Western values, in thiscase that one should be visible in their sexual orientation identity.This view, however, was a minority. In contrast, many respondents made surprisingly derogatory commentsabout visible sexual minorities from their religio-cultural ingroup, which may have been based on unpleasantsocialisation experiences. Nadeem (early 20s) notes “a vibe I cannot explain” due to his perception of sexual minori-ties from his religio-cultural ingroup as being “freaky, or slaggy or bitchy”. Yassin, late 20s, commented:“I can't deny Asians are slaggy. They're very licentious. You see with Asians, mainly [ethnic ingroup descrip-tor], this life is a journey. You just gotta s*** as much c*** as possible then got to get married so no onefinds out you're gay, but secretly they shag their wives like they're [their wife is] a man or just lie as if itwas a phase and flick a switch and pretend to be straight”.Respondents referred to visible (i.e., “out”) gay Muslims pejoratively, calling them “fools”, “freaks” or “thirstyqueens” who “just want attention”. Thus, visibility of sexual orientation identity was not seen as palatable or accept-able amongst many respondents, who were put off by those who were “out”. As Zaf (early 30s) notes, this precludedhis ability to develop social support with ingroup sexual minorities as he “found them too ‘out’” and found theiradherence to social norms within “gay culture”, such as the “hook-up” culture, which was focused on casual sexualencounters, off-putting:A lot of…Gaysians [slang portmanteau of the words gay and Asian] … act all camp and promiscuous… Itwas getting to a point where I thought I was an outlier, not being part of the one-night stand cult… RarelyI meet someone who challenges me mentally, not in an arrogant way…[but] I have class, I don't go fortrash…. I've not been to any of the Gaysian nights where you'll find the weirdos in Soho dressed in sarees.Zaf's comments imply a sense of superiority over people who are visible in their sexual orientation identity,which may be an attempt to distance himself from people within his ingroup who did not fit his perceived norms ofperforming sexual orientation identity in a “discreet” manner.Others seemed to suggest acceptance and visibility based on sexual orientation identity was limited to“freshies”, (i.e., a pejorative slang term referring to recent immigrants from South Asia) and not an option for British-born ingroup members. Sadru (early 30s) suggests this is due to belief in an idealised media representation of homo-sexual relationships and not reflective of what he felt was the reality of “gay culture”. He explains,Only freshies want relationships - it's just about NSA [no strings attached; slang term referring to casualsexual encounters] …No one is really after friends. It's so hard finding mates … All my friends have left meand that is typical of how Gaysians are. (Sadru, early 30s).MITHA ET AL. 759Here, he outlines an unwritten social rule within his ingroup that interaction with sexual minority men waslimited to fleeting sexual encounters – with the implication that British-born South Asian Muslim men under-stood relationships with men are not possible due to both religio-cultural norms and the cultural norms of the“hook-up culture” within the mainstream LGBTQ+ community, and only “freshies”, who may be ignorant ofthese unwritten socio-contextual rules, looked for something substantive. Indeed, respondents' experienceswith other ingroup members were not that of support but complexly layered based on “acceptable” levels of dis-cretion. The hidden and stigmatised nature of same-sex attraction led to an unspoken view that this was simplyto be understood as transitory behaviour, not an identity and not a characteristic from which to develop a net-work of peers.Respondents related substantial difficulties establishing peer networks and social support from their sexualminority ingroup. Wasim (mid-20s) commented: “I avoid Asians… most Asian guys are pure effort because of not beingout”. Saif (mid-20s) described his experiences trying to form friendships with other sexual minority ingroupmembers:It would be nice to find other guys that get it, who are at the same point … I've had people yell at me as towhy I'm looking for a boyfriend when it won't last, and Islam forbids it… if you are talking to Asian guys on[dating app] … they make threats…to out you.Saif's quote raises two issues: firstly, that despite seeking ingroup members in a similar position to himself fornetworking and peer support, he instead received hostility and moralistic judgement from others even though theywere looking for casual sexual encounters with other men; and secondly, sexual minority ingroup members havethreatened to “out” him. The former seemed almost paradoxical – with religion used as a reason against establishingsame-sex romantic relationships, yet there was no discussion of religion in relation to same-sex sexual activity or sexoutwith marriage, again suggesting use of “religious prohibition” and mores was selective and used as a means to“explain” ethnic identity and cultural norms. The finding that sexual minority religio-cultural ingroup membersattempted to “out” others was a shocking finding and was corroborated by other respondents, such as Zeeshan(early 30s) who related experiences of being “catfished” by other British South Asian Muslim men, that is, the phe-nomenon of using other people's photographs or identity on social media or dating websites to falsely represent theperson's own identity:I'm done with [Asian ethnic group] … They wonder why people do not like them. They are so f***ing arro-gant it's unbelievable. They are d***heads, w***er rude boys who give the hypocrisy of being ultra-religious.They say one thing but [they are] really after sex. They collect and use pictures (of other people). If you everagree to meet one, you best believe that more often than not it's going to be with someone else than [theperson shown in] the picture.Zeeshan expressed substantial frustration with the phenomenon of religious performativity. In his view, thebehaviour of sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men he encountered are incompatible with what he under-stands as pious behaviour, and thus he perceives their strategic performativity of religious identity as hypocritical.Issues regarding performance and visibility of religious identity have been explored previously (Hopkins &Greenwood, 2013).The pejorative language participants used to describe their ingroup was striking. Through the lens of socialidentity theory, it is possible this may have been driven by fear, lack of trust, or frustration, which caused people todistance themselves from their ingroup, due to fear of being “outed”. This could also be due to the black sheep effect– engaging in denigration towards socially undesirable ingroup members (Marques & Paez, 1994). These ingroupmembers are perceived to contribute to social identity negatively therefore denigration towards them helps achievepositive distinctiveness. Such self-group distancing might be useful because the individual does not need to deal with760 MITHA ET AL.negative stereotypes of the ingroup. However, this also undermines group belonging and other benefits that ingroupidentification provides (Bourguignon et al., 2020).Overall, for many participants, the taboo nature of their sexual orientation in their religio-cultural context,coupled with their negative experiences relating to others within and outwith their ingroup, led to feelings of isola-tion and left them with limited safe spaces to discuss their experiences and gain social support – all of which areassociated with lower well-being (Jetten et al., 2015). Given respondents' negative experiences, it was unsurprisingto hear responses such as that from Riaz (early 20s): “It means so much to be able to talk to someone about this”.3.5 | Identity integration – Reflecting on religion and sexual orientationGiven negative social interactions respondents faced from their religio-cultural ingroup and the “mainstream”LGBTQ+ community, it was important to understand how they attempted to reconcile their sexual and religiousidentities into a coherent sense of self.When discussing their sexual encounters with men, respondents noted negative feelings such as self-disgustand regret, feeling “sick”, “feeling like shit” and a sense of shock – as Hafiz (late teens) puts it “what the f*** did I justdo?” Abbas (mid-20s) stated: “I feel guilty and empty after sex. Maybe being gay is wrong and weird”. These negativeemotions were strongly tied to how they viewed their sexual orientation within a religious framework. In line withfindings of previous studies (Afzal, 2014; Jaspal & Cinnirella, 2010; Siraj, 2012a), several respondents were adamantthat their sexuality was not accepted within their religion, with many interpreting their same-sex activity as evidenceof immorality. Other respondents felt their sexual orientation must be a “test” from God:I believe it is a test in life I'm failing at. But I believe my Lord is the Most Merciful and He has made me andwill understand. God wouldn't put pork or alcohol on this planet if it wasn't a test. Everyone has their owntest… Acting on this is my choice. I probably won't pass. Not every test is [meant] to be passed(Benayoon, mid-20s).Some respondents tried to contest this negative view, noting homosexuality was similarly censured in otherAbrahamic traditions, yet those religious communities have now begun to accept homosexuality. Others notedother Islamic prohibitions (e.g., gambling, usury, alcohol consumption) which others engage in yet face far less socie-tal condemnation. Some felt religious views on homosexuality were simply misinterpretations and that “When I havefeelings for a guy that is the most natural emotion that I can feel romantically. Doesn't mean that I should go to hell”(Riaz, early 20s). Many respondents critiqued this view, however, for example Chihangeer (mid-20s):I know that [being] gay isn't a choice. It's also not permitted [religiously]. There are a lot of BBCDs [British-born confused Desis; pejorative slang term referring to South Asians who are felt to have assimilated toBritish culture] who think it is but … I know I'm doing a sin.Some respondents developed their own strategies to deal with identity threat, such as Sadru (early 30s) whoreported: “I can't wait for the sun do go down [during Ramadan] so I can hook up” – implying that while he adhered toreligious prescriptions during Ramadan, such as abstaining from food, water and sex during sunlight hours, heengaged in same-sex sexual encounters at night. Others adopted a “hyper-religious” perspective by taking on addi-tional Islamic duties, such additional fasting, prayers and charitable work with secular and Islamic organisations,ostensibly to offset engaging in what they felt to be sinful behaviour.Respondents varied in how they self-identified, with many rejecting LGBTQ+ identity labels. Manyrejected identifying as gay, instead framing their same-sex attraction and behaviour as “having fun”. It wasnotable how many respondents sought to emphasize their perceived heterosexual masculinity, framingMITHA ET AL. 761same-sex encounters in behavioural terms based on sexual availability. Samir (late 20s) stated: “Girls don'ts*** so I go on apps to find guys for that…” while emphasizing: “I'm not gay”. Hamza (early 30s), who had agirlfriend, stated he was the active partner in sexual relations with men and noted: “I'm not gay… I just lookfor guys to feed my fantasy”.The label “gay” was largely rejected and often pathologised. Prior research has shown that being feminine or“not masculine enough” was associated with negative societal stereotypes, internalised among sexual minority men(Eslen-Ziya & Koc, 2016). This was observed where Arif (late 20s) placed emphasis on his having physical attributeshe felt made him attractive to gay men. He stated a sexual preference for women, emphasizing his prior sexual expe-rience with them, but felt they required additional preferences in a prospective partner beyond physical attractive-ness, such as “money, car, a job, someone with their own place to live”. He saw sex as more available with menbecause “men aren't so fussy”. Some respondents rejected labels to avoid negative associations. Alim (mid-20s) stated“I don't class myself as gay, because that makes you sound you are not normal…”. As explored in other themes, therewas a distinction between respondents' positioning of their own orientation and identity against those more visiblein the mainstream:My sexuality is really none of anyone else's business. Those who are out and proud are a bit of a turn-off(Zeeshan, early 30s).These negative perceptions by respondents explains the view by Parvez (early 20s) that “it's kinda rare to be agay Muslim”.As a form of identity negotiation, some respondents acknowledged their sexual orientation comprised a part ofthem but rejected the idea of it being a component of their overall sense of identity:“Being gay isn't who I am, but a part of me. Being gay is about who I go to bed with at night, not a life-style” (Nadeem, early 20s).Studies with Jewish and Muslim samples have shown that when there is identity conflict, gay men may use sev-eral strategies such as strengthening identification with religion, trying to keep sexuality and religion com-partmentalised, trying to integrate the two, or giving up their religion altogether (Kumpaso\u0002glu et al., 2020;Schnoor, 2006). However, the latter has not been common amongst sexual minority British Muslims, showing insteadhyper-affiliation to the religious ingroup (Jaspal, 2014b). As seen in this study, strengthening identification with oneidentity might require distancing from another one with negative consequences for well-being. However, identityintegration literature suggests identities can be blended and harmonised which is linked to positive outcomes(Benet-Martínez, Leu, Lee, & Morris, 2002; Koc & Vignoles, 2016, 2018). For instance, gay-Christian identity integra-tion attenuated negative effects of religious identity on guilt and shame among gay-Christians (Anderson &Koc, 2020). Therefore, it is important to understand the nature of the conflict and try to reduce it for psychologicalwell-being.In this study, respondents' attempts at reconciliation often did not lead to resolution but instead involveda process of internal acceptance of their same-sex attraction and recognition that rejection on multiple fronts– from the mainstream LGBTQ+ community, their own religious ingroup, and mainstream society – precludedvisible manifestation of this intersectional identity. The quote below epitomises feelings of isolation manyrespondents faced:There's going to be a point in your life where you're going to be feeling so shit about something, but youcan't tell anyone because of the people around you. I really hope this happens in your life just so you knowthe feeling of what I may be going through.… I do have to live like this. I don't have a choice. I can't beme. This world won't let me be me (Shahid, mid-20s).762 MITHA ET AL.4 | LIMITATIONSWhile this study had interesting findings, it is important to note potential limitations. Findings suggested differencesin approaches to identity integration amongst younger and older respondents – suggesting younger respondentsmay internalise wider societal acceptance towards sexual minorities. Education may also play a role - many respon-dents who noted some degree of outness were students, and it may be at university settings they are exposed togreater diversity and discourse regarding sexual minority identities. It is striking, however, that many of the older,professionally employed respondents held negative views regarding sexual identity visibility suggesting views maynot be class dependent. The demographic mix of the respondents could indicate an element of sampling bias –respondents would have had to be comfortable to some extent with acknowledging their sexual orientation and bewilling to participate in a study examining it. Given that the British Muslim population is largely economicallydeprived and disadvantaged, the sample therefore might not reflect the wider British Muslim community for whomtraditional attitudes likely still hold, as alluded to by the older participants. Finally, we acknowledge South Asian andMuslim communities are not homogeneous, and that there are different geopolitical and colonial histories which mayaffect individuals' lived experience.5 | CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSThe findings of this study suggested that wider societal acceptance of homosexuality was not necessarily reflectedin the everyday experiences of British Muslim South Asian sexual minority men. Adherence to a “gay identity” waspredicated on various inter- and intra-group external influences. Depending on the relative privilege held in a particu-lar context, respondents used a number of identity management strategies to manage identity threat as well asthreat of disclosure. Attempts to engage with the mainstream LGBTQ+ community left them feeling excluded andOther-ed, with some even going so far as to re-label their ethnic identity to fit in with hierarchies of desirabilitywithin LGBTQ+ communities. Within their ethno-religious communities, heteronormativity made them feel like theydid not belong, and in some cases, being open about their sexual orientation identity often came with a risk, there-fore they had to assess this potential risk when deciding whether to disclose to others. Despite a desire to connectwith other sexual minority ingroup members, respondent's experiences were not that of support but instead layeredin different levels of “acceptable” degrees of discretion, with negative experiences and ingroup shaming a commonoccurrence. Respondents who had internalised a same-sex attracted identity often adopted assimilationist andhomonationalist biases, leading them to denigrate others from their religio-cultural ingroup. Overall, respondents’accounts highlighted an isolating and psychologically vulnerable experience.It is important to note respondents largely eschewed sexual orientation identity labels. This accords with previousresearch with sexual minority Muslim communities (Boussalem, 2020), which notes that non-disclosure actually wasseen to be empowering and identity enhancing, facilitating belonging in a collective community. Given respondentslargely viewed themselves as “straight” and found no support from within mainstream or ingroup LGBTQ+ organisa-tions - this has implications regarding service delivery and understanding how sexual minority identities are played outamongst communities of colour. Whilst some support groups exist, utilisation of them may vary depending on “accept-able levels of discretion” and thus only cater to a select group, based on levels of personal privilege. An intersectionallens is critical here – respondents who appeared at ease in their degrees of outness of their sexual orientation identitywere middle-class, which does not reflect the mainstream British Muslim community. Thus, service planning predicatedon sexual identity may not be suitable for communities which are socially disadvantaged.Sexual minority British Muslim South Asians may be reluctant to affiliate outwith discreet online communities(Kesvani, 2019) and known circles due to the anonymity they provide and the maintenance of izzat within theirreligio-cultural ingroup. The latter point cannot be emphasised enough. Respondents tended to conflate religion withMITHA ET AL. 763cultural influences, for instance in noting religious expectations to marry an opposite-sex partner and perceived pro-hibitions against same-sex romantic relationships. Yet, if religious concerns did matter, one might also have expecteddiscussion regarding religious prohibition of zina or even perceived prohibitions regarding same-sex sexual activity, andwhile that emerged to some extent with some respondents feeling their sexual orientation was a “test” or notingexperiencing feelings of guilt or shame when engaging in same-sex sexual encounters, what seemed to matter most formany was religio-cultural performativity. Being “out” or having a same-sex romantic partner would make sexuality, aculturally private practice, public and potentially induce feelings of collective shame to the individual and family. Thus,izzat mattered. By denying a sexual orientation identity, and relegating same-sex sexual activity to behavioural termsand engaging largely in discreet casual sexual encounters, respondents could be publically perceived to be pious,viewed as adhering to cultural norms, and maintain “face” within their community. This was echoed by several respon-dents who noted the importance of maintaining collective honour and familial happiness over their own.Finally, and importantly, respondents’ experiences of social exclusion when attempting to enter mainstreamLGBTQ+ spaces has implications regarding the rhetoric of inclusion within the LGBTQ+ “community”. Despiteattempts to engage in mainstream LGBTQ+ spaces, experiences of racism and Other-ing led respondents tofurther distance themselves from these spaces and appeared to even foster elements of discrimination towardsthe LGBTQ+ community by whom they felt excluded. An intersectional lens is crucial here – a minority groupgaining societal acceptance via a discourse of inclusion cannot then employ exclusionary and discriminatoryattitudes towards other minoritised groups who do not “fit” a narrow, hegemonic mould. In a climate wheresexual minority British South Asian Muslims feel excluded based on their religious identity and ethnicity, devel-oping cultural and religious competency is crucial to encourage and support multiply marginalised individuals, tocreate truly safe and inclusive spaces, and not further disadvantage and perpetuate inequalities within these“inclusive” spaces.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.ETHICS STATEMENTEthical approval was obtained from the University of Edinburgh.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTDue to the sensitive nature of the data, and the fact that it contains potentially identifiable information about humanparticipants, it is not possible for these data to be openly shared.ORCIDKarim Mitha https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2538-5130Sheila Ali https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2614-0867Yasin Koc https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6727-3842REFERENCESAbbas, T.

    "abstract": "Since the Stonewall uprisings, there has been greater social acceptance of homosexuality within Western contexts. Nevertheless, those who are at the intersection of more than one minority identity continue to face prejudice and discrimination, including homophobia and racism. Though there has been increasing work regarding the experiences of sexual minority people of colour (POC), a lacuna remains regarding the experiences of sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men and the integration of sexual minority and religious identities, particularly within a context of increased societal acceptance towards sexual minorities and societal Islamophobia. In this study, 38 sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men were recruited via snowball sampling and interviewed. Data were examined via reflexive thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: degrees of “outness”, hegemonic Whiteness and the LGBTQ+ community, internalisation of White hegemony, distancing from the sexual minority religio‐cultural ingroup, and attempting to reconcile potential identity conflict between sexual orientation identity and religious and cultural identities. Respondents' experiences highlighted substantial social exclusion due to intersectional disadvantage as well as a lack of intra‐community social support, suggesting substantial isolation, psychological implications and a general eschewing of identity affiliation based on sexual attraction. This has implications on services predicated on identity affiliation which may potentially exclude the needs of hidden and intersectionally disadvantaged populations",
