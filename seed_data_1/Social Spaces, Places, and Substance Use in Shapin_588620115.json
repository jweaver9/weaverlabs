INTERVIEW GUIDE......................................................................... 1473ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWords cannot express my gratitude to my family, friends, and colleagues who have mademy graduate school journey meaningful and possible. My incredible mentor and chair, Dr. MarisaOmori, is one of the most selfless, intelligent, and kind people on this planet. Her ability to helpthose of us who feel unmoored or scattered regain our confidence earned her the nickname TheShepherd of Lost Souls. Academia can be intimidating, particularly for a woman of color, and I’mhonored to have her as my first mentor of color. While she says that she gives too much feedback,which I affectionately term The Marisa Method, her insights have formed the backbone of thisproject and my success as a graduate student. From our 11:00 pm calls about job market anxietiesto the countless hours she has spent reviewing my work, she has modeled what it means to be ascholar and mentor. I also want to thank the rest of my committee: Drs. Lee Ann Slocum,Samantha Simon, and Matthew Ball. Lee, thank you for helping me wrestle with theory and foralways being a listening ear. Sam, I appreciate all your encouragement and for pushing me tothink critically. Matt, I’ve learned immensely from our talks and I’m so grateful for yourunwavering guidance. You all have, individually and collectively, helped strengthen me and thiswork.I’m also grateful to have been mentored by Drs. Heidi Grundetjern, Angela Dwyer,Terrence (TJ) Taylor, and Richard Moran. Heidi, thank you for being an incredible collaborator,friend, and fellow Foucault Fashionista. Ange, I want to thank you for all the sage advice andlaughter that inevitably ensues during our conversations. TJ, through all the changes at UMSL,you were the one constant and I wish you were still with us—thank you for knowing me as ascholar, student, and a person. Professor Moran, I still wish I could’ve taken all of your classesback at MHC (I was shy one class!) and I thank you for encouraging me to go into criminology.I’ve also been fortunate to have received support from the Division of FeministCriminology (DFC) and the Division of Queer Criminology (DQC) at the American Society ofCriminology. In the earlier stages of this project, the DQC awarded me financial support in theresearch and writing of this dissertation for which I am truly appreciative. I also thank the DQCfor existing as a safe queer social place (see what I did there?) and for saving my academic life.Y’all have shown me that queerness does indeed belong in criminology.This dissertation was also made possible by my graduate student and karate families.Those early years dancing in The Grove, playing trivia at Mike Duffy’s, and suffering throughASC Practice Talks are memories that I hold dear to my heart. To my karate family, I honestlydon’t know if I would have made it this far without y’all—thank you for letting me vent, keepingme grounded, and proving to me that I can do anything (even run five horrendous miles). VictoriaInzana, thank you for helping me get through stats (I still owe you lemon pound cakes!),providing the tea, and for being, as my mom nicknamed you, Magical. Luis Torres, you’re likethe brother I never had and I appreciate all of the wisdom you’ve given me. Dale Dan-Irabor andCherrell Green, you both taught me how to survive and thrive as a Black person inacademia—and have the strength to hold my own.Finally, thank you to my family, girlfriend Rosa Cartagena, and A1 Jasmine Ana Ramón.My parents, Bonnie Mayfield Early and Kevin Eugene Early, should be credited not only forgiving me life (thanks for that!) but for teaching me the value of hard work, education, laughter,and success. Rosa, thank you for the hours you’ve spent reading and editing my work, loving me,and encouraging me to keep going. Jasmine, thank you for reminding me that I have always been“Dr. Early” and for being there, no matter the distance. Lastly, to my grandmother Olive AnitaStewart Mayfield, I will always carry your mantra and work ethic with me: Good, better, best,never let it rest until the good is better and the better is the best. (Thanks Grandma! Now I thinkit’s time to rest.)4ABSTRACTResearch has suggested that queer people may be more likely than their cisgenderheterosexual counterparts to use substances. Largely, these higher rates are commonlyexplained through frameworks of victimization or (ab)use that render substance use as aform of coping or inherently problematic. While some queer people do use substances tocope, the social spaces, places, and contexts in which use often occurs are often obscuredor ignored. More recently, contemporary queer criminologists have explored queersubstance use and have considered how it is intimately linked to social space, place,identity formation, and community building. This dissertation draws from queercriminological approaches to theorize and develop the idea of social spaces and places. Inparticular, it explores how queer people define and create social spaces and places, howsocial spaces and places shape identity formation, and how social spaces and places areimbued with substances. To investigate, 49 in-depth semi-structured interviews wereconducted with self-identified queer people who have used substances or frequentedqueer social spaces to examine the intersection of social place, contexts, substance use,and queer identity formation. As such, it is argued that social spaces and places can bedistinguished, imbued with identities, messy, and crucial sites for substance use andidentity formations through use.5CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION AND LITERATUREREVIEWINTRODUCTIONThe Pulse Nightclub, a gay club in Orlando, Florida, was the site of one of thedeadliest shootings in U.S. history. On June 12th, 2016, Omar Mateen, a 29-year-oldex-private security guard, entered Pulse on its weekly “Latin Flavor” night. Aftersurveying the environment, Mateen left, returned with his AR-15 rifle, and beganopening fire into the crowded club of more than 300 people who were primarily Latinxand queer, ultimately taking the lives of 49 people and wounding 53 others (Natour,2021). In the aftermath, many queer1 people were traumatized, not only because of themassacre that occurred, but because it shattered the idea of safe spaces or places for queercommunities (Stults et al., 2017). Underlining the crucial ways that queer social andplaces shape behavior and intersect with identity, the horrific attack on Pulse was a clearviolation of the security that these environments provide, encouraging some queer peopleto use substances to both grapple with trauma concerns about violence towards queeridentities (Boyle et al., 2018). Largely, the mass murder that occurred at the PulseNightclub viscerally underscored one vital, yet understudied, theme for criminologicaltheoretical research: The importance of queer social spaces and places in shaping queersubstance use and identities.1 Although the terms “queer” and “LGBTQIA” are often used interchangeably, this proposal will primarilyuse “queer” to describe LGBTQIA+ people. This decision was made to both highlight “those with sharedexperiences by virtue of their existing outside of heteronormativity to be represented in research” and “italso allows researchers and others to bring criminological attention to bear on issues of injustice, or toimportant silences in these discourses, and open up a space for these injustices to be remedied, or thesesilences to be broken” (Ball, 2014:5).6Distinctions and overlaps between a queer social space and a queer social placecould be compared to that of a house vs. a home. While a house refers to the physicalstructures or material aspects of a place of dwelling, the term “home” implies a state ofimmateriality rooted in “human experience” or interaction (Rykwert, 1991:51). In thisregard, a queer social space is a site or geographic locale whereas a queer social place isan assemblage of connections and interactions. Generally, queer social spaces such asbars and clubs have “historically acted as safe places and sites of resistance” (Dwyer andPanfil, 2017:3) or cradles for civil rights movements (Carter, 2004). As such, many queerpeople seek out these environments because they are welcoming (Gieseking, 2016),places for socialization (Israelstam and Lambert, 1984), and offer opportunities forcommunity-building (Croff et al., 2017). As built from a shared identity, queer people cansafely develop and explore their queer identities in these spaces, cultivate queer places,and therefore are “important to the creation of community and interpersonal socialbonds” (Anderson and Knee, 2021:120).As a refuge from systems of heteronormativity, such as familial ostracization andlegal surveillance (Dwyer and Panfil, 2017), some queer people use queer social spacesto participate in various experiences, such as substance use (Demant et al., 2018). Classicsymbolic interactionist scholars who do work on identity have suggested that identitiesare inseparable from social environments (Erikson, 1959), created from socialinteractions (Mead, 1934), integral to the formation of communities (Mead, 1934), andfoster subsequent behavior(s) (Erikson, 1959; Mead, 1934). Substance use behavior, forexample, can be taught through environmental (e.g., being in a bar) and interpersonal(e.g., conversing with a friend) cues (Townsend and Belgrave, 2000).Spaces and places, similar to identities, are fluid and shaped by their inhabitants7(Love, 2017; Goffman, 1969). Put more simply, they are “messy” and precariouslynestled within balancing acts of negotiations and concessions (Manalansan, 2014: 569).While queer social spaces were created for queer people to feel safe and build community(Croff et al., 2017), the presence of heterosexual2 people within queer social spaces canrebrand them as “questionably queer places” (Hartless, 2019: 1044). In comparison,because heterosexual social space is recognized as all social space (Bell et al., 1994), thepresence of queer people or the construction of queer social places within heterosexualsocial space could be considered an act of subversion (Rushbrook, 2005). As such, whilequeer social spaces may distinguished by heterosexual social spaces, the routinepositioning of queer social spaces “in opposition to heterosexual [social] spaces” Oswin(2008: 97) can obscure the ways in which all space can be “sexualized or desexualized bydifferent people at different times” (Hubbard, 2000:192).Substance use is intimately linked to identity- and community-building in queerpopulations (Race, 2009). In fact, some queer people have even described the importanceof substance use, specifically within queer social places, in accessing queer communities(Demant et al., 2018; Race, 2009) and their own queer identities (Pienaar et al., 2020;Race, 2009). Not only do researchers find that substance use is more acceptable withinqueer populations relative to heteronormative populations (Demant et al., 2018; Race etal., 2016), but queer civil rights movements explicitly encouraged a rejection ofnormative conceptualizations of identities, including through substance use (Hill, 2011).Although substance use is certainly an important and shared practice for facilitating queeridentity, it works in tandem with other aspects and practices such as music, clothing, and2 Although the term “straight” is queer slang for “heterosexual” (Doyle, 1982), this dissertation uses thelatter for one important reason. While I personally take no issue with the term “straight,” its original usagein contexts reaffirms the naturalness of heterosexuality and renders other identities as “crooked,”“misshapen,” or “bent” (Henry, 1959).8interactions (Race, 2009; Southgate and Hopwood, 1999). However, substance use isoften used to enhance these other aspects which makes it an interesting point ofexamination (Taylor, 2010). As such, work on queer substance use has highlighted howconsuming substances has “brought into being” queer communities, spaces, and places(Race et al., 2017:43).Although social space and place is often invisibilized, one importantconsideration in drug research is the importance of social contexts (Becker, 1963;1982;Goode 1970; 1972) and environmental factors (Agnew, 1992; Dai, 1937; Lindesmith,1947; Newcomb and Harlow, 1986) in shaping substance use and identities. For example,Goode (1970:23) illustrated how smoking marijuana is often done in gatherings of closeor personal groups that frequently results in “a kind of subcommunity.” While usingsubstances within these subcommunities, people identify with each other, bond over theprocess of using substances (Goode, 1970), and can further explore their identities amonglike minded people (Hunt et al., 2019). Building from this work, social3 and physicalplaces, as sites for community building and resistance, are likely important for queercommunities and the construction of queer identities. For many queer communities, bars,clubs, and parades are the predominant cultural, historical, and social spaces (Demant etal., 2018; Felner et al., 2020). These social spaces are often dependent on theconsumption of substances. For example, a bar cannot exist without the distribution ofalcohol (Hunt et al., 2019). Heterosexual social spaces, on the contrary, are not oftenconsidered specific spaces. Rather, they are recognized as the wider “hetero-normativeworld” by some queer people (Valentine and Skelton, 2003:885). While some queer3 I draw from the idea of Oldenberg’s (1989) social places, which I define as any physical or virtualenvironment that is embedded with meaning-making processes that regulate normative expectations foridentities and behavior(s).9people actively avoid entering these environments, those that do sometimes abstain fromsubstance use out of fear of anticipated or past experiences of lived violence (Hunt et al.,2019). Preferring to indulge in queer social spaces, some queer people create places tocircumvent heteronormative expectations of docility and provide temporary, butliberating, moments of respite (Valentine and Skelton, 2003) and identity formation.Research finds that people classified as sexual minorities, such as members ofLGBTQIA+ or queer communities, are significantly more likely than their heterosexualcounterparts to engage in substance use (Koeppel, 2015; Marshal et al., 2008; Talley etal., 2010; Bowers, Walls, and Wisneski, 2015). These higher rates of use are oftenexplained through frameworks of victimization, trauma, deviance, and abuse (Felner etal., 2020). Just as other people with identities that have been marginalized, queer peopleoften experience stress and victimization related to their gender and sexual identities(Dwyer, 2015)4, which can encourage some to cope through substance use (Mereish et al.,2017). Yet, work within this area often renders social space, place, and context as“passive backdrop[s]” (Jayne et al., 2016:117). As such, while this research hashighlighted the ways in which some queer people use substances, the reliance uponframeworks of substance abuse as inherently risky has eclipsed other equally validexperiences. Furthermore, because the behavior(s) of queer people, particularly queerpeople of color, are considered embodiments (Nygren et al., 2016; Dwyer, 2015), theseapproaches may not be suitable for understanding queer substance use.4 However, what is unique to queer people is the overlapping experience of “identity concealment”(McConnell et al., 2018:2), where the conscious or subconscious suppression of a queer identit(ies),coupled with homophobic or transphobic disenfranchisement(s), can force some queer people to grapplewith internalized homophobia, “a common manifestation of minority stress” (Hatchel et al., 2019:2); Forexample, some queer people of color must simultaneously navigate racial/ethnic discrimination in queerspaces and homophobic stigmatization(s) within their racially/ethnically similar communities (McConnellet al., 2018).10Queer criminological frameworks can help make sense of substance use beyondvictimization-only and risk-based frameworks. Queer criminology has its roots in queerand feminist theory which consider how identities and behaviors are socially constructedand reproduced (Panfil, 2018; Buist and Lenning, 2016). In this regard, queercriminological theories suggest that many approaches to criminological research arereflective of heteronormative assumptions of gender and sexuality (Buist and Lenning,2016). To mitigate these biases, scholars have considered the development ofqueer-specific approaches in addition to a “queering” of the field more generally,imperative to any criminological research (Panfil and Miller, 2014; Rogers and Rogers,2022). These considerations are both theoretical and methodological interventions thatquestion how criminological questions are conceptualized, asked, and analyzed. Theconcept of “queering” refers to the destabilization of ingrained and preconceived notionsof gender and sexuality, and a potential solution to the historical and contemporarypaucity of work that includes gender and sexually diverse peoples (Ball, 2014; Buist andStone, 2014).THE CURRENT PROJECT AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LITERATUREBuilding on queer criminology, identity and substance use, and the social contextof substance use literature, this dissertation examines how social spaces and places aredistinguished and navigated as they inform queer substance use and create opportunitiesfor queer identity formation through substance use. In this project, I ask the followingresearch question: How do different types of social spaces, places, and contexts shapehow some queer people use substances in relation to identity formation? This questionalso consists of the following three sub-questions reflected in my three substantive11chapters: 1) How are queer and heterosexual social places defined or distinguished bysome queer people?; 2) How do social places shape how substances are used by somequeer people?; and 3) How do different types of social places shape how some queerpeople use substances in identity building?. In doing so, I draw from 49 in-depth,semi-structured interviews with self-identified queer people who have spent time in queersocial spaces and places to investigate the intersection of place, behavior, and identity.Utilizing a queer theoretical framework, which suggests that substance use can beadvantageous to identity and community development, the study emphasizes pathwaysinto drug use and into queer social spaces and places, motivations for participating inrecreational drug use within these environments, and, generally, the role of social spaces,places, and substance use within them in defining and (re)defining identities.This work makes four contributions to the literature. First, although prior researchconsiders how queer people move through queer social spaces and places, little hasexplored how queer people move through heterosexual social spaces and places. Second,in exploring the messiness of space and place-based boundaries, this work investigatesthe shifting materializations of space that can be impacted by the movements of people.Third, in moving past traditional victimization frameworks of queer substance use asinherently abusive, this dissertation highlights how substances can be constitutive ofsocial space and place. Fourth, because substances can be used as a “technology” orstrategic mechanism through which people transform themselves (Foucault, 1988:18;Pienaar et al., 2022) or their environments, this work underscores the importance ofdeveloping queer-specific theories to understand queer substance use.Since most of the criminological literature to date has focused on explaining12in-group versus out-group dynamics between queer and heterosexual communities, littleresearch is explicitly centered on queer communities, particularly, those who thriveoutside of the gender binary, such as nonbinary5 or genderfluid6 people (but seeNewcomb et al., 2020). Similarly, although a small yet growing body of research hasexplored how queer social spaces are built or navigated, little is known about how queerpeople navigate heterosexual social space and place. As such, this project expands andqueers criminological work and theory (Panfil, 2018; Buist and Lenning, 2015; Ball,2016).Third, I aim to create a conceptual model for understanding how queer socialspaces and places are constructed from substance use and can shape queer identityformation. In theorizing space and place through queerness, I consider the ways in whichit can be constructed, defined, and imbued with identities. Additionally, this approachthinks through the messiness of space and place through an examination of queer andheterosexual social space and place which may parallel the messiness of identityformation. In doing so, social spaces and places become an analytical tool to investigatehow queer people understand their environments and identities. Furthermore, this worklocates queer substance use within social space and places and contexts which haveimplications for identity formation. In other words, since behaviors are gendered(Kruttschnitt, 2013), sexualized (Ball, 2016), shaped by, and taught through spaces andplaces (Unnever and Owusu-Bempah, 2018), any analysis of queer substance use mustrecognize the role of queer social space and place. As such, this research challenges6 See definition of nonbinary in footnote #5.5 The term, nonbinary or “non-binary” refers to people who thrive outside the gender binary. While somenonbinary people may identify as transgender, not all do, and nonbinary identities can “include identifyingas neither male nor female, both male and female or as different genders at different times (Rimes et al.,2019:1).13heteronormative frameworks of space, place, behavior, and identity.The remainder of this dissertation consists of 5 chapters. The following sectionreviews the literature on place vs. space, queer vs. heterosexual social space and place,the messiness of space and place, and the relationship between space, place, queeridentity formation, and substance use. Next, in describing the dissertation’s methods,Chapter 2 discusses the importance and mechanisms of queer criminological work.Chapter 3 considers how queer and heterosexual social spaces and places aredistinguished, defined, navigated, and “messed” through the navigation of people.Subsequently, Chapter 4 explores how social spaces and places can facilitate or inhibitqueer substance use, substances constitute queer social space, and how substances can beused strategically to navigate social spaces and place. After, Chapter 5 explores how theinterplay between social space, place, and substance use can impact queer identityformation. Lastly, Chapter 6 offers a conclusion, implications of the current research, andsuggestions for future research.14LITERATURE REVIEWPLACES AND SPACES: THEORY AND THE MESSINESS OFHETEROSEXUAL AND QUEER SOCIAL SPACES AND PLACESTHEORIZING SPACE AND PLACEConsiderations of space and place have long been linked to the study of humangeography (Withers, 2009; Agnew, 2011) to describe how spaces and places structure thebehaviors, feelings, and meanings people ascribe to environments and settings (Relph1976; Tuan (1997). Although used interchangeably7, Tuan (1997:6) viewed space andplace as separate, where space “allow[s] movement” or recognized as a “sense of [aplace]” (Withers, 2009:638), and place is denoted by a “pause in movement” or thecharacter of a space (Tuan, 1997:6). In this regard, while meanings are necessary forplaces, spaces are composed of places and are imbued with meaning through a sense ofplaces (Withers, 2009; Agnew, 2011; Tuan, 1997). For example, to describe St. Louis,MO in terms of a space, one could say that: it is a Midwestern city located within thestate of Missouri, nicknamed “the Gateway to the West,” and is 66.17 square miles insize. As a place, a description of St. Louis might include that: it originated from thecultures of Indigenous, Black, French, Dutch, German, and Irish people; it is thebirthplace of African American ragtime jazz, and was home to the country’s first gasolinestation. Conversely, Relph (1976) viewed space and place as “dialectically'' interrelatedbecause people move through spaces based upon the meanings given to places, and alsonavigate places based upon “their spatial context” (Seamon and Sowers, 2008:4). Some,7 It should be noted that while this project considers how social places are distinguished and navigated,much of the academic literature that describes features of a social place commonly uses the term “socialspace” instead. As such, this section, in addition to the remaining others, will use the term “space” and“place” interchangeably in reviewing the literature.15like Coleman and Collins (2006:2) and Agnew (2011:5) have noted the “simultaneousprominence and disappearance of place” and the impact of technological advances, suchas social media, as reflective of “space…conquering place”.I draw from the idea of social spaces, which I define as any physical or virtualenvironment that holds opportunities for encounters and interactions. This definition alsoinforms my idea of social places which are located within social spaces and areembedded with meaning-making processes that regulate normative expectations foridentities and behavior(s). Yet, because the meanings of social spaces are attributable toits composition of social places and social spaces give social places an environment toinhabit, they are constitutive of one another. However, much of the theorization on socialplaces has been eclipsed by a notion of space. The development of social spaces as a lensof analysis was originated by Durkheim (1838:444), which understood spaces asoccupied by specific “social groups” or kinds of people who replicated and defined thecultures of the wider society, or “social life” (Buttimer, 1969; Reed-Danahay, 2019). Inanalyzing how religion structures society, Durkheim proposed that all people have their“assigned place in social space” which dictates how they interpret themselves and others(pg. 444). Later theorizations, such as Sorre (1957), critiqued Durkheim for excludinghow “physical conditions influenced social differentiation” (Buttimer, 1969:419). Forexample, while groups of people have specific social spaces constructed from theirvalues, these spaces remain stratified by “points of privilege” that regulate inhabitants(Sorre, 1957:np; Buttimer, 1969). In this regard, social spaces were a “mosaic of areas”embedded with power relations (Buttimer, 1969:419). Subsequent revitalizations ofDurkheim (1893) such as Bourdieu (1984; 1986) analogized social spaces as reflective ofclass and social capital that can further indicate a person’s “position in the social space”16(Skeggs, 1999; Lindell, 2022:383). Here, access to resources, such as education ormoney, become forms of (social) capital are brought into social spaces and structureinteractions within them (Skeggs, 1999).Social places, conversely, became popularized by Oldenburg (1989) whoexamined how and why people seek places for interaction. As “third places,” socialplaces are public places outside of employment or domestic spheres that people activelyseek out or create (Oldenburg, 1989:18). Within these places, people developopportunities for pleasurable encounters, “community building,” and identity formation(Oldenburg, 1989:18). In this regard, the term “social places” might be more appropriatefor examining settings created from or centered on specific identities and behaviors. Yet,while social sciences have explored the ways in which social spaces are gendered(McDowell, 1983; Bondi, 1992), racialized (Hunter et al., 2016), and demarcated bysexuality (Knopp, 1992; Bell and Valentine, 1995)8, the term “social place” is oftenreserved for class- or social-based interpretations. For example, people whose identitiesthat have been marginalized are often excluded or further marginalized within certaintypes of social place (Kobayashi and Peake, 2000). In other words, the interchanging ofspace and place has obscured the ways in which meaning-making processes within aplace structure how people navigate themselves and their environments.Social spaces become sexualized through expectations for identities and behavior(Bell et al., 1994). If social spaces are sexualized and racialized, as Knopp (1995)8 For example, people who thrive outside the gender binary and expectations for gender presentation, or“gender outlaws,” face elevated levels of assault (Namaste, 1996:226) in public places. As an example, the“weaponiz[ation of] white femininity” (Negra and Leyda, 2021:352) by the “Central Park Karen” to vilify aBlack male birder illustrates how racialized and gendered fear (Day, 2006) can reinforce claims to place(Shiffman et al., 2012). Largely, this work demonstrates how violence can be interwoven into the fabric ofplace (Bourdieu, 1989).17suggests, places, as existing within spaces, are too subjected to sexualization. Forexample, the unique challenges that queer people, particularly Black queer people,encounter while navigating heterosexual and queer places (Newcomb, 2014; Slater et al.,2017) can further highlight the role of place in dictating expectations of identity andbehavior. Additionally, the racialization of space ascribes certain people with assumptionsthat structure how they are interpreted. In this regard, trans women of color existing inheterosexual public spaces are presumed to be sex workers (Robinson, 2020) and aremarked as “out of place” (Bell and Binnie, 2004:1810; Branton, 2020). To simplify howidentities can structure how people move through spaces, a queer Black male in a studyby Bowleg (2013:764) explained, “When you are [Black and gay] everyone hates [Whitepeople hate you because you are Black; Black people hate you because you are gay].” Inthis regard, homonormative definitions that synonymize queerness with whiteness (Vo,2021) and compulsory heterosexuality within racialized communities (Battle and Ashley,2008) can render queer people of color unmoored to place.Yet, while notions of access and violence can structure opportunities and limitaccess to existing within particular spaces, these “expulsions” (Sasken, 2014:1) are alsotransformed and reshaped into other place-making possibilities (Hunter et al., 2016;Holland-Muter, 2018). Hunter and colleagues (Hunter, 2010; Hunter et al., 2016:2;Hunter and Robinson, 2018) term “Black place-making” as the ways in which someBlack communities transgress stereotypes of Black existence and transform “hostilespaces,” such as the intensified and violent policing within Black neighborhoods (Ritchie,2017), to places of resilience and growth as they resist destruction. “Queerworld-making,” similarly, describes the ways in which some queer communities to“disidentify” (Muñoz, 1999:1) with hegemonic constructions of identity that privilege18dominant ideologies to “construct a world,” or a place, that is affirming of queerness9(Holland-Muter, 2018:213). In this regard, places, particularly queer places, areenvironments that attempt to “break down barriers that exist in everyday life” andprovide opportunities for community building (Delamere, 2013:238).QUEER SOCIAL SPACES AND PLACESQueer social spaces are considered safe (Stults et al., 2018) environments forqueer communities and are places of resistance (Myslik, 1996) that provide access topleasure (Hunt et al., 2019) and temporary respite from the wider heteronormative world(Adams, 2020). Generally, research has suggested that the predominant queer socialspaces tend to be bars, nightclubs (Hunt et al., 2019), and parades (Demant et al., 2018;Felner et al., 2020). These environments were created in response to the historical linkageof queerness and biological determinism which marked queer people as geneticallyinferior and dangerous (Woods, 2014). As such, the violent regulation of queer (orqueer-coded10) behaviors (Hill, 2011) subjected queer social spaces to various forms ofstate-perpetrated violence such as police raids (Agee, 2006). Largely, queer bars becameone of the few social spaces where queer people could get together, socialize, andcultivate a sense of community (Race et al., 2017) in an accepting and more welcomingenvironment (Gieseking, 2016).Queer social spaces are, as Halferty (2008:19) notes, built from and situatedwithin a “complex negotiation” between the behavior of customers and “the discipliningforce of” the owners; this discourse sustains “(sub)cultural production and meaning[s]”10 Often used to refer to characters from television shows or movies, “queer-coded” describes aninsinuation that a person is or certain behaviors are (assumed to be) queer (Brown, 2021).9 As such, spaces must be understood as constructed from and situated within a continuous negotiation ofsocial interactions and systems of power—“it both constitutes and is constituted by socialrelations.”(Visser, 2008:1345).19(Halferty, 2008:19). Within these environments, some queer communities have developed“queer cultural capital” that defines spaces as queer through the use of language,(Pennell, 2016:325), nonverbal communication (Pennell, 2016; Nicholas, 2004), or musicgenres or aesthetics (Brett et al., 2002; Hubbs, 2007). For example, Nicholas’s (2004:72)ethnography of “gaydar,” a play off the word “radar,” highlights the ways in which queerlanguage and behavior, such as “the prolonged eye-gaze,” could trigger a queer person’sgaydar and signal to them that they were in similar company. Music, similarly, is centralto queer social places through genres such as disco that symbolized “Blacks, Latino/asand queers coming together in ecstasy” (Hubbs, 2007:242).Additionally, queer social spaces often use symbols to identify themselves toqueer communities (Wolowic et al., 2017), and even specific sub-communities withinthem (Halferty, 2008), to distinguish themselves from heterosexual social spaces.Examining the decor of Bar Le Stud, a gay bar in Montreal, CA, Halfety (2008) notedhow the rainbow flag, leather Pride flag, and the Association des Motorcyclistes Gais duQuébec specified that the bar catered to gay men who were interested in leather and bearsubcultures. Wolowic et al., (2017:11) investigated how queer young people balancedrecognizing rainbow flags or decor as a symbol of queer friendliness and “vet[ting]”spaces before deciding if they were truly queer.Although much of this work has created frameworks for how queer social spacesmay be distinguished, a recognition of how social contexts within social spaces canimpact distinguishment is still missing. The erasure of lesbian social spaces and thepredominance of places catering to cisgender gay men, for example, has created a socialcontext in which certain queer identities are excluded or rendered invisible (Morris,202016). As such, this project investigates these overlaps between social space, place, andcontext that create opportunities for queer people to “step out of the hetero-normativeworld where they often feel marginalized … where [they] can lose themselves and theirtroubles in music, dance and sex … and enjoy themselves together in ways that can beempowering” (Valentine and Skelton, 2003:855).HETERO(SEXUALIZATION) OF SPACES AND PLACESWhile a small body of research has explored heteronormativity within culture orcultural expectations (Valentine, 1993), as constitutive of public spaces (Foucault, 1978;Rushbrook, 2002), and the “(hetero)sexing of space[s]” more broadly (Visser,2008:1345), attention to heterosexual spaces remains underdeveloped (Bell andValentine, 1995). Largely, this paucity might reflect the embeddedness of heterosexualityor “assumption of ‘naturalness,’” particularly within Western societies (Kirby and Hay,1997), that obscures the ways in which heterosexuality structures “power relations in allspaces” (Valentine, 1993:396).If every space is a heterosexual space (Bell et al., 1994) and “waiting to bequeered” (Puar, 2002:935), it might be difficult to tease apart (or examine wholly) howspaces are or become heterosexualized. One solution, as Hubbard (2000:198) notes, couldbe examining how morality and the performance of heterosexuality informs how“heterosexuality is naturalized in (and through) space.” Another could be examining howthe normalization of heterosexual desire obscures the (hetero)sexing of social spaces toheterosexual people while reinforcing that delineation to queer people who curb theirown desires in public (Rushbrook, 2002). In other words, while heterosexual couples“can walk together safely in the streets,” queer people are forced to navigate “the threat21of violence each time they enter the public realm—particularly if they walk with asame-sex partner” (Valentine, 2003:226; see also Kirby and Hay, 1997). As an example,Snapp et al., (2015) describe how schools surveil and punish queer young people forengaging in public displays of affection in comparison to their heterosexual peers.In contrast, regulations of gender and behavior suggest that spaces are not“‘naturally’ ‘straight’ [and are…] actively produced and hetrosexualized” (Binnie,1997:223; as cited in Oswin, 2008:90). Particular social places, such as workplaces(Valentine, 1993) and spaces such as college bars (Strouse, 1987), perpetuateheterosexuality through expectations for heterosexual behavior and identities. Describinghotels as “surrogate home[s]…associated with heterosexual family units” and stereotypesof heterosexual adultery of “dirty weekends,” queer (or queer-coded) people reserving asingle bed suggests that they have a “sexual relationship” (Valentine, 1993:404).Similarly, Schilt and Westbrook’s (2009:441) analysis of the workplace as a site of “thesocial maintenance of heterosexuality,” underscores the complexity of heterosexual socialspaces. On one hand, “gender normals,” or cisgender11 men and women, affirmedtransgender identities in asexual interactions such as asking a trans man to lift a heavybox. On the other, interactions that were perceived as sexual, such as flirtations orquestions about particular sexual encounters, reverted back to invalidations of transpeople’s genders that fixated on genitals (Schilt and Westbrook, 2009).Largely, these spatialized boundaries are protected and sustained through implicitor explicit forms of homophobia (Valentine, 1993) and violence (Valentine, 1989; Adler11 The term “cisgender” is used to describe people whose current gender is the same as their sex assigned atbirth (Guadalupe-Diaz). Similarly, “transgender” is often used as an umbrella term to refer to people whosecurrent gender or gender presentation, as explained by Bornstein et al., (2006) but noted in Guadalupe-Diaz(2019:1), “varies from the cultural norm for their birth sex.” The word “current” was both used anditalicized in this definition to underscore and reflect the fluidity of identity across time, space, and place.22and Brenner, 1992; Namaste, 1996). For example, “gender and sexuality [become]intertwined” in space when women (or women-coded people) labeled as “failures offemininity” (Guest, 2008:251) and men (or male-coded people) considered to have“misstepped masculinity” are “marked” as queer and assaulted for lack of adherence toheterosexual expectations for gender and behavior (Namaste, 1996:225). As such,heterosexual social spaces for queer women or women-coded people (Valentine, 1989),and those who thrive outside of the gender binary (Namaste, 1996), can become sites ofrisk and vulnerability (Adler and Brenner, 1992).THE MESSINESS OF QUEER AND HETEROSEXUAL SOCIAL SPACES AND PLACESQueer theorists have deployed messiness as a tool to critique hegemonicmethodologies that essentialize identity and behavior (Law, 2004), knowledge (Dadas,2016), complicate decolonial scholarship (Meer and Müller, 2021), and, particularly,examine queer lived experiences (Manalansan, 2014; Winton, 2022). Messiness is arethinking and recognition of the research process (Campbell and Farrier, 2015), andthose researched (Manalansan, 2014), as organized disorder. For example, Manalansan(2014; 2018) describes how the messiness of queer existence and mismeasures, meaning,a messy persistence despite pressures to passively submit, that sustain “impossible livesmade livable” (Manalansan, 2018:496). As such, considering how social spaces andbehaviors within them are regulated, messiness, as an analytical tool, can inform howqueer people understand themselves and their environments.Ahmed’s (2006) development of queer phenomenology explores this messinessthrough analyzing how spaces can queer or “expel” bodies (Sassen, 2014:5). Consideringhow heterosexual spaces “can straighten queer bodies” (Vitry, 2021:939), queer bodies23within heterosexual spaces appear as if “they are slanting or oblique” (Ahmed,2006:560). For example, the presence of heterosexual people within queer social spacescan temper the ability to safely explore queerness (Gruskin et al., 2007). However, thepresence of other queer people within heterosexual social spaces can create a sense ofdefiance and intensify queer identities (Kirby and Hay, 1997). In this regard, while socialspaces themselves can encourage or discourage the formation of identities, their shiftingembodiments, meaning, who is within the space, can further complicate these processesand the formation of place.Like queer identities and experiences, spaces are fluid and precariously (Love,2017; 2016) impacted by people who move within them (Goffman, 1969). Put moresimply, social spaces are messy. For example, the embeddedness and (re)production ofsexual identities within social spaces through various symbols (e.g., a rainbow flag) ormechanisms (e.g., queer languages) can distinguish queer from heterosexual spaces. Yet,these distinctive boundaries can be simultaneously blurred or rematerialized (Bell et al.,1994; Skeggs, 1999). For example, the presence of heterosexual people in queer socialspace can transform that space into one more uncomfortable for queer people(Rushbrook, 2005). In contrast, the presence of queer people in heterosexual social spacecan act as a form of subversion or (re)occupation of space (Bell et al., 1994). As such,queer social spaces cannot be placed in “coherent opposition to heterosexual spaces”(Oswin, 2008:97). Furthermore heterosexual and queer social spaces are “sexualized ordesexualized by different people at different times” (Hubbard, 2000:192).The development of queer social spaces could be a form of queering heterosexualsocial spaces, that is, persisting and taking space in a heterosexual world traditionally24seen as hostile towards queerness (Gieseking 2017). Others question that spaces, such asheterosexual social spaces, “may not be restricted to heterosexuality” (Bell et al.,1994:33) if gender is constructed from situated performances (West and Zimmerman,1987; Butler, 1990) and is not owned by specific genders. Butler (1990) and Bell et al.(1994:33) demonstrate how queer “deployment of heterosexual identities,” such as the“gay skinhead” and “lipstick lesbian” can disrupt and delegitimize heterosexuality asinnate. For example, the hyper-feminization of the lipstick lesbian and thehyper-masculinization of the gay skinhead, through embracing heterosexual presentationssuch as mini-skirts or shaved heads, is a form of “heterosexual drag” that creates accessto heterosexual culture (Bell et al., 1994:33). Generally, queer adaptation of heterosexualpresentation could be read as a larger subversion of heterosexuality which can offer queerpeople opportunities to transgress, access, and “parod[y]” (Bell et al., 1994:33)“heteronormative ways of being” (Johnson, 2017:23).The queer occupation of heterosexual social space can facilitate queerplace-making. Exploring the queering of heterosexual social spaces, Burgess (2005:27)noted that prominently placed Canadian “positive space” campaign posters, whichpromote visibility and safe spaces for queer university students, challenged “structuralforms of homophobia” and created queer places within academic spaces (Burgess,2005:27). This queer re-working of spaces, such as the journal entries, poems, and shortstories of young Black queer people writing about queer concerns of visibility (e.g.,publicly holding their partner’s hand) are literal and literary (in this case) rejections ofrespectability politics that dictate what, who, or how to be (Johnson, 2017). Bouncemusic, for example, is a young Black queer New Orleanian style of hip-hop that “thriveson…and gleefully” transforms a hypermasculine and heteronormative genre into “spaces25of queer performativity” (Casey and Eberhardt, 2018; Johnson, 2017:544). Lyrics spat byKatey Red, a Black trans woman, like “You wanna fuck me when I suck your dick”(Casey and Eberhardt, 2018:331), for example, is a form of disidentification or theintentional reimagining of ways of existing (Muñoz, 1999). As such, Red’s occupation ofheterosexual social space rejects hetero and homonormative positionalities that definehip-hop and queerness, especially Black queerness, as incompatible.The (hetero)sexualizing of queer social space, conversely, is often positioned asan invasion or an erasure. Much of the literature exploring the increasing presence ofheterosexual people, particularly heterosexual women (Casey, 2004; Skeggs, 1999),within queer social spaces is focused on gay- or lesbian-specific space. Largely, much ofthis work has explored concerns about safety (Skeggs, 1999) or gendered and sexualizedviolence (Eves, 2004). Similarly, questions centered on “claims to these spaces” orbelonging have complicated the boundaries of these environments (Casey, 2004:453).Betsky (1997) points to this growing publicization of queer social spaces as a façade forthe “commodification of queer space” and subsequent absorption into heterosexuality(Rushbrook, 2002:194). The inclusion or assimilation of queer nightlife into general (andheterosexual) culture is sometimes recognized as evidence that queer social spaces arebeing “taken over by heterosexuals” (Branton and Compton, 2021:7). For example, somelesbian women have referred to this phenomenon as the “de-dyking of queer spaces,”through the involvement of heterosexual women into gay or lesbian specific spaces(Casey, 2004:446), or a “penetration” of queer social spaces more generally (Rushbrook,2002:197).26If queer social spaces are constructed subversions of heterosexuality (Gieseking2017), heterosexual women within queer social spaces may be read as embodiments ofheterosexual violence and occupation (Skeggs 1999). Gaining access through friendshipswith gay men (Skeggs, 1999; Casey, 2004), some heterosexual women use queer socialspaces as an escape from the “constant male gaze” within heterosexual social spaces(Skeggs, 1999:227). Their very presence, especially for lesbian women (Skeggs, 1999;Casey, 2004), can raise concerns for queer safety and visibility (Eves, 2004; Rushbrook,2002). Butch lesbian women in Eves’ (2004:486) study, for example, expressed“frustration” and “resent[ment] in being harassed by heterosexual women while trying touse the bathroom in their own spaces. Similarly, gay men describe similar irritation by theblatant occupation or “disruptive presence” of heterosexuality within queer social spaces(Baldor 2019; Branton and Compton 2021:87). As such, heterosexual men lecherouslyattending burlesque shows (Branton and Compton, 2021), heterosexual couples kissing ingay bars, and heterosexual women hosting bachelorette parties are often viewed as“visible heterosexual rituals” that “straighten[ed] gay spaces” (Baldor, 2019:428),rendering them as mere “‘tourist’ destinations” (Nichols, 2017:1).Much of the considerations of the (hetero)sexualizing of queer social spaces asinvasive is largely dependent on the behavior, “attachments to[,] and motivations for”heterosexual use of these spaces (Baldor, 2019; Matejskova, 2017:2). ExtendingValentine’s (2003:237) conception of “time-space,” Matejskova (2017) explains howthese perceptions are rooted in shifting constellations and materialities that impact spatialdefinitions or negotiations. Notions of privacy and safety (Bell, 2011; Demant et al.,2018), two centralities to queer social spaces, can be threatened or upheld dependingupon “the particular configuration of bodies in time-spaces” (Matejskova, 2017). For27example, Branton’s (2020:19) exploration of a gay bar holding opportunities for allwomen to practice pole dancing revealed how an initially sex-positive atmosphere, freefrom the “judgment or touching,” shifted drastically by the presence of heterosexual menwatching and “sit[ting] back…in a weird, horny little funk.”Rushbrook (2002:191) suggests that when queer identities and cultures “becamecommodities” or sites for consumption, heterosexual people began to enter and interactwith queer social spaces. Queer spaces became sites for “urban, middle-class white menand women ‘slumming’ (or touring) drag balls” (Heap, 2008: as cited in Baldor,2019:421-422). As such, drag-themed events, like drag shows (Rushbrook, 2002) orbrunches (Siddons, 2019; Patillo, 2022), are uniquely situated events that “messy” theoverlapping of heterosexual and queer social space. For example, a gay bar in Brantonand Compton’s (2019:80) study promoted drag shows as part of queer culture and usedlanguage such as “you’re welcome if you’re not hateful” to entice heterosexual attendees.Yet, the cultivating of a primarily heterosexual audience transforms an initial place forqueer inhabitation into that of heterosexual consumption. Furthermore, because dragbrunches are primarily used to \"expose\" heterosexual audiences to queer culture12(Patillo, 2022), the idea of an heterosexual presence as invasive is bypassed by theinvitation of the queer social space.In contrast, while bachelorette parties in queer social spaces represent a blurringof heterosexual and queer place, they are also distinctive “site[s] of performativeheterosexuality” (Nelson, 2019:47) that further render queerness as a “spectacle” (89).Considered to be safe havens from heterosexual male violence, bachelorette parties allow12 The novelty of drag is “more normal” for queer people (Branton and Compton, 2019:85).28heterosexual women to drink to excess (Jones II and Essig, 2022). In doing so, largegroups of heterosexual women often use up a lot of space “in favor of their ownpurposes” by centering festivities around the bachelorette and her impending marriage(Nelson, 2019:89). Bachelorette parties may also be considered an appropriation of queerspace (Joness II and Essig, 2022), ignorant of the historical roots of queer places (Nelson,2019) and marriage as heterosexuality property (Baldor, 2019). As such, commonbachelorette behaviors, such as capturing pictures of people without their consent(Baldor, 2019), “grab[bing] the butt of a cute gay man,” and taking selfies “in front of theleather daddies” position queer people “as if they were exhibits in some queer zoo”(Jones II and Essig, 2022:n.p.).The tensions between queer social spaces as exclusively existing for queercommunities and the increased “hetero(sexing)” of queer social spaces (Valentine,1993:409) also could be read as a queer embracing (albeit forced, as some would caution)or capitalization of “heterosexual consumption” (Branton and Compton, 2021:88). Forexample, Siddons (2019) notes that drag branches make a lot of money. Although(straight) bachelorette parties are performances of heterosexuality, the ability for queerpeople to get married encourages some, like a participant in Baldor’s (2019:431) study, totake an inclusive yet apathetic and “powerless” stance on the prominence of bacheloretteparties. Some drag queens have also expressed that bachelorette parties generate the mostamount of money and queer attendance is low (Jones II and Essig, 2022). Jones II andEssig (2022:n.p.) term dependency “hetrification,” or the use of heterosexual money to“seduce” and “appropriat[e]” queerness, and caution that it will be the death of queersocial spaces and culture. As such, some may question if “the physical places where29queer men and women had to go to define themselves, are [even] necessary,” or, as Imight add, sustainable “anymore” Kolby and Betsky (2017:88).In this regard, power is central to the overlapping of interpretations orinhabitations of social space. The assumption that all public space is heterosexual socialspace is a motivation for the creation of queer social spaces and places. Furthermore, theexistence of this disparity or access to public spaces more generally positions theclaiming or queering of heterosexual public space as subversive. Yet in comparison, thepresence of heterosexual people within queer social space is often read as a form ofcolonization or tourism. Put simply, social spaces are messy in their contestations,formulations, and embodiments.THEORIZING QUEER IDENTITIESQUEER IDENTITY FORMATION(S) AND CRIMINOLOGYWhile many have theorized the locus of queer identity formation, they are largelyconcentrated around three frameworks. Some, like D’Emilio (1983) linked emergence ofvisibly queer identities to various economic shifts that provided opportunities to subvertcompulsory heterosexuality. Other developmental theories consider the term “sexualidentity” to suggest that queer identities develop from positive divergences fromheteronormativity and are materialized through desires, romanticism, and how oneunderstands themselves (Denton, 2016:58). Perhaps more popular, poststructural andcritical approaches deconstruct dichotomous definitions of gender, sexuality, and otheridentity categories to emphasize the social construction of identity through political,historical, power, and social dynamics (Denton, 2016). Regardless of these converging30and diverging perspectives, historical analyses of queer identity formation(s) havesuggested that the binarization of gender and sexuality “were even less tethered” to anidentity in the past than contemporarily (Kunzel, 2018).One of the most prominent poststructuralists, Foucault (1976) examined thehistory of sexuality and demonstrated how 19th Century Victorian ideological departures,rooted in power relations, defined sexual behaviors in terms of sexual identities. AsFoucault (1978) argues, while queerness has always existed, the linkage of morality withconcerns for acceptable sexual behavior coupled with the search for the “true” man orwoman birthed “homosexuality.” Queer people, and queerness more broadly, wasconsidered a pathology or disease (Fricke, 2010), and a distinct “species” fromheterosexual people (Foucault, 1976:43). Yet, challenging these categorizations, 1960sand 1970s modern queer civil rights movements’ reclamation of the word “queer” pushedback against the rendering of queer identity as inferior or abnormal (Denton, 2016).Rather, as an “anti-assimilationist” project, the word queer became a rallying cry for theimportance of distinctions and recognitions of queer as an affirmation (Kunzel,2018:1565).More recently, however, queer (Ball, 2016), post-structuralists (Namaste, 1994),and other critical scholars (Woods, 2014) re-problematized normalcy of shared “queer”experiences and definitions. For example, while “the closet” may be considered a“normative” step in queer identity development (Cass, 1979; Sedwick, 1993), some havesuggested that this form of queer performativity may be reflective of whitehomonormativity. Ross (2005), for example, describes that because some Blackcommunities have unspoken acknowledgements that someone is queer, there is less of an31emphasis or need for someone to announce that they are queer or “come out.” In thisregard, positioning the closet as a normatively queer pathway may fail to consider thevarious racialized differences surrounding queer identity development (Ross, 2005).Different theoretical branches, such as queer theory, were created to explore thedevelopment of sexuality or sexual identities. Like the critiques put forth by Blackfeminists who suggest that mainstream feminism has erased the experiences of Blackwomen (Heyes, 2008), queer theorists emerged to challenge the omission of queernesswithin civil rights and feminist discourses (Rivera and Natal, 2019). Generally, queertheory destabilizes the naturalness of heterosexuality (Foucault, 1978; Rubin, 1984),considers how heteronormativity is actively produced (Butler, 1990), and challenges thebehaviors that binarize heterosexuality and “homosexuality” (Sedwick, 1990). Althoughqueer theory, at its core, is a vow to “obliterate the very idea of normal,” thepredominance of white queer experiences has resulted in the important work of queerBlack people being ignored (Robinson and Hunter, 2019:164). For example, whilemodern queer civil rights movements were created from the actions of Black transwomen (Comfort, 2021), the ways in which racism and misogynoir impact queer peopleof color often remain unacknowledged (Bailey and Trudy, 2018; Robinson and Hunter,2019). As such, Black queer theory emerged as a reclamation of queer identity and spacethat challenges the assumptions that are “rooted in the epistemologies” of oppression andasks how might they be “repurposed for the liberation arsenals of marginalized groups”(Robinson and Hunter, 2019:172; but see also Johnson, 2005).While larger debates on the “intellectual heritage” of queer criminology oftenfluctuate between critical and feminist criminology (Panfil, 2018:2), queer and feministtheoretical traditions are central to queer criminology’s consideration of how gendered32and sexual identities are regulated within or in proximity to the criminal justice systemand processes of criminalization (Panfil et al., 2022; Buist and Lenning, 2016; Lamble etal., 2020; Ball, 2016). Generally, feminist theory considers the ways in which gender isconstructed from roles (Friedan, 1963), rooted in violent regulations of women’ssubordination to men (MacKinnon, 1979), and perpetuated via systems of power andinequality (De Beauvoir, 1949). Although, contemporarily, feminist theory is associatedwith Butler’s (1988) assertion that gender is a socially constructed performance, earlierforms of feminist theory were first articulated by Black women (Rice, Harrison, andFridman, 2019). For example, questioning the role of feminism at a women’s right’sconvention, Sojourner Truth asked, “Ain’t I a woman?” to challenge racializeddefinitions of femininity that marked Black women as undeserving of the same treatmentthat white women accessed (Rice, Harrison, and Friedman, 2019). Subsequent Black andqueer feminists, such as Lorde (1984), Davis (1993), Crenshaw (1989), and Collins(1990) have revitalized Truth’s analysis to emphasize how Black women experiencespecific forms of gendered and racialized oppression (Race et al., 2019).In response to the criminalization of queer communities, queer criminologyemerged in the early 2000s (Panfil, 2018) to expose the embeddedness ofheteronormativity within criminological research (Buist and Lenning, 2015; Panfil, 2018)and institutions (Snapp et al., 2015; Vitulli, 2013). Vitulli’s (2013:113) “historicizing [of]the prison as a queer site” explores how the criminal justice system assumes and expectspeople to fall along the gender binary and criminalizes the identities of trans and queerpeople. Social institutions, such as schools, can also reify heteronormative regulationsthat justify violence against young queer people (Snapp et al., 2015). Additionally,research that has explored how queer communities engage with violence primarily33focuses on their experiences of victimization rather than the ways in which they fightback or advocate for themselves (Panfil, 2018).SOCIAL SPACES, PLACES, QUEER IDENTITY FORMATION(S), AND SUBSTANCE USESpaces, places, and substance use impact how people understand themselves andform their identities (Dieseking, 2017). In turn, identities, such as queerness, can subvertthe “normative arrangements of bodies, things, spaces and institutions” (Manansalan,2015:567). For example, because queer social spaces, like bars and clubs (Anderson andKnee, 2020; Demant et al., 2018), were (and arguably remain) one of the few publicspaces where queer communities could gather (Stults et al., 2018), much queersocialization is centered around substance use. Furthermore, as safer environments (Stultset al., 2018), queer social spaces are embedded with “spatial practices” that are crucial tothe formation of queer identities (Dieseking, 2017:47). Conversely, although substanceuse is certainly an aspect of some heterosexual social spaces (Wenner, 1998), some queerpeople are deterred from engaging in these atmospheres. For example, the reinforcementof heterosexuality as “natural” via gendered bathrooms can complicate queer affirmativeself-making (Martínez-Guzmán and Íñiguez-Rueda, 2017; Kirby and Hay, 1997) andsubstance use (Gruskin et al., 2007; Hunt et al., 2019).Attributable to the “social” context of social spaces, substances are often presentwithin both queer (Race et al., 2022) and heterosexual social spaces (Halim, Hasking, andAllen, 2012). However, there is a perception that substance use is more acceptable,prevalent, and encouraged within queer communities (Demant et al., 2018; Race et al.,2017). Similar to the role of substances in Beatnik development of a counterculture(Belser, 1991), using substances shaped some aspects of queer civil rights movements by34encouraging pleasure(s) and rejecting heteronormativity (Hill, 2011)13. Other work hashighlighted how consuming substances has been integral in the (re)formation of manyqueer communities and identities by allowing room for pleasure and the discovery ofqueer identities (Race et al., 2017; Race, 2009). For example, Florêncio (2021:14)explains that queer chemsex contexts are undoubtedly part of a “life-affirming culture”that both safeguards “the reproduction and survival of queer bodies and ways of living”and “the very survival of the subcultural subjectivities of queer folk who participate inthem.” In this regard, substances used within particular social spaces and contexts can be“technologies of the self” (Foucault, 1988:18) or of “the body” (Preciado, 2008:109).Largely, the power of substances to lower a person’s inhibitions and create sitesfor vulnerability can structure how some queer people form their identities across socialspaces, places, and social contexts. For example, because queer social spaces areperceived to be safer alternatives to heterosexual social spaces (Stults et al., 2018), somequeer people feel more comfortable exploring their queerness through substances withinqueer social spaces. On the contrary, substance use within heterosexual social spaces maybe less attractive and inhibit the exploration of queer identity through substance use(Gruskin et al., 2007; Hunt et al., 2019). As such, an investigation of the intersection ofsocial space, place, substances, and queer identity formation must consider how spaceand place-based boundaries are distinguished, substances are used, and the overlapping ofspace, place, and substances merges to form queerness.13As such, “the use of substances became intricately connected to a flourishing sexual liberation movementthat promoted free and open expression of the queer body as a political act and queer sexuality as a humanright” (Hill, 2011:2).35THEORIZING SUBSTANCE USE, QUEER SUBSTANCE USE, ANDSTRATEGIC USE OF SUBSTANCES ACROSS SOCIAL SPACES AND PLACESTHE CONTEXT, SPACE, AND PLACE OF SUBSTANCE USEExamining the ways in which behaviors can flow across different social spaces,literature has suggested that a person’s psyche, settings (Zinberg, 1984), and socialcontexts (Duff, 2005; Okamoto et al., 2014) can impact substance use. Zinberg’s (1984:1)terms “set” and “setting” highlight how people approach substance use. “Set” refers to aperson’s mentality, meaning, attitude, when using substances (Zinberg, 1984:1). “Setting”describes the social and physical atmosphere(s) in which a person consumes substances(Zinberg, 1984:1). For example, because substances can lower inhibitions and increasefeelings of vulnerability (Turchik, 2009), some queer people prefer or exclusively indulgewithin queer social spaces in comparison to heterosexual spaces to avoid uncomfortableassumptions about and violence directed towards their identities (Gruskin et al., 2007;Hunt et al., 2019).Contexts, as an interplay or “an assemblage of” spaces, ways of being, andsocial(ized) rituals, can produce or dismantle opportunities for and definitions of (Agar,2003) substance use (Duff, 2007:504). In this regard, problematizing Zinberg (1984) andother work that has focused solely on “historical and structural factors” (e.g., identitycharacteristics), a post-structuralist critique of drug use literature could investigate howparticular “contexts shape and transform drug use behaviours.” For example, socialcontexts, as constitutive of social spaces and places, are imbued with various “social andsymbolic meanings” that arise from use (Duff, 2007:504). In contexts or spaces wheresubstance use is encouraged or expected, such as a nightclub, some people may use as a36form of participation (Havere et al., 2011). In other contexts, such as a doctor’sappointment, entering that environment while under the influence is neither encouragedby the space or its inhabitants. In this regard, recognizing how substance use iscontextualized transforms social spaces into “active constituent[s]” (Jayne et al.,2016:117; as cited in Hunt et al., 2019:6; see also Duff, 2007).Queer social spaces and places may be emblematic of how substance use activelytransforms environments. Generally, there is a wider acceptance of substance use withinqueer communities (Southgate and Hopwood, 1999). For example, a young person inDemant et al., (2018:10) suggested that since queer social places are nestled within a“here we are, we’re gonna celebrate” culture, substance use is very prominent.Encouraged by both the people within the spaces (Southgate and Hopwood, 1999) andthe construction of the spaces themselves as primarily bars and nightclubs (Hunt et al.,2019), some queer social spaces have an almost symbiotic relationship with substances inwhich consumption is normalized (Lea et al., 2013). For example, some queer clubs orqueer social spaces may hold an “after-hours14” to enliven patrons and because, as aparticipant in work by Hawkins et al., (2019:7) explained, “the reason why they sellwater and Gatorade is for people who are high on MDMA or ecstasy, so we know thatthose spaces right away are already infiltrated with this drug,” (Hawkins et al., 2019:7).Considering this embeddedness of substances within queer social places, andcommunities more broadly, some have highlighted how queer communities were createdfrom substance use (Race et al., 2016), and can build bonding within queer communities(Koeppel, 2015). Many queer people feel more connected to their communities through14 After-hours are a setting where clubbers or party attendees can gather after the initial space has closed,recharge, and keep partying (Hawkins et al., 2019).37substance use (Power et al., 2018) and some, like a queer young person in Demant etal.,’s (2018:10) study, explained that using is “like a discourse, it’s like your access cardto the community.” Substance use can also contribute to a sense of resilience (Race et al.,2016; Power et al., 2018). Using psychoactive drugs such as MDMA or ecstasy gavesome queer people freedom to explore “stigmatised desires” (Race et al., 2016:n.p.)particularly within queer social spaces (Power et al., 2018). Substance use in queer socialspaces can also build a sense of resiliency (McKirnan and Peterson, 1989).Although some queer people use substances strategically within social spaces,little research has examined these processes. Within queer social spaces and substanceuse, much of the work is largely concentrated on the social context of combiningsubstances with sex. Examining the social norms within queer chemsex sessions15,Ahmed et al., (2016) found that their participants used substances to reimagine the sexualpossibilities of their bodies (e.g., contorting themselves into otherwise unattainablepositions) and design frameworks of consent and boundaries around how much theywould consume. As another example, some queer people of color have explained howusing substances can help transgress racialized and previously inaccessible spaces assubstances can create access “into every community” (Jerome and Halkitis, 2009:359).As such, integrating a socio-spatial analysis of queer substance use can highlight theagentic and meaning-making processes that can materialize through using substances,particularly within queer social spaces (Power et al., 2018; Pienaar et al., 2020).While the literature has made many advancements of queer social spaces, places,and substance use, missing is a consideration of how substances can be constitutive of15 Chemsex sessions are gatherings where substances are used to enhance sexual activities (e.g., havingprolonged sex with multiple partners).38social space. Because the predominant queer social spaces are ones dependent onsubstance consumption, substances can help define spaces. Furthermore, although muchis known about the rates of substance use among queer population, little has consideredhow some queer people use substances strategically. If heterosexual social space isconstitutive of all public spaces, the ways in which queer people navigate and interpretthese environments may be impacted by substance use. More explicitly, some queerpeople may intentionally use substances as a specific strategy for navigating heterosexualsocial spaces.CRIMINOLOGICAL THEORY AND SUBSTANCE USEMuch of the criminological theory examining recreational substance use16 hasextended social spaces to consider how the social contexts in which use occurs, theramifications of use, and the larger role of substance use within a person’s life (Dull,1983, Miller and Miller, 2014). Two of the most popular theoretical explanations includecontrol and strain theories17, which suggest that substance use is shaped by social norms,access to favorable definitions of authority and conformity (Hirschi, 1969), impulsivity(Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990), and stressful aspects of a person’s environment (Agnew,1992)18. Social control theories underscore the ways in which externalized andinternalized mechanisms of control shape how people interact with substance use18 For example, Agnew (1992) extended Merton’s (1968), which explained substance use as an anomicreaction to inabilities to reach hegemonic markers of success (e.g., wealth) to create general strain theoryand suggest that people use substances to cope.17 Other approaches include structural functionalism, as the foundation for control or strain theories, whichsuggests that substance use is shaped by social norms (Comte, 1896). These theories suggest that substanceuse is both normal and are anomic producing responses to abrupt social and cultural changes (Durkheim,1897), and are crucial warning signs for the instability of society (Parsons, 1951). While functionalistsconsider substance use to be both functional and necessary, they are often viewed as symptoms of largersocial problems and the destabilization of social equilibrium (Parsons, 1951 as cited in Shaw, 2002).16I define substance consumption as the use of drugs (pharmaceuticals, narcotics, psychotropics, etc.) toalter a person’s corporal or psychic state of being.39(Hirschi, 1969; Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1969)19. In comparison, conflict theories suggestthat while behaviors such as substance use are produced through social problems arisingfrom capitalist social inequalities, they are ultimately criminalized as a tool to control theworking class (Marx, 1978)20.Research has suggested that queer people may be more likely to use substancesthan heterosexual people (Marshal et al., 2008; Bowers et al., 2015)21. Some haveconsidered factors, such as homophobic/transphobic peer-to-peer bullying (Marshal et al.,2008) and ostracization (Silvestre et al., 2013) that could “push” (Young et al., 2017:5) orencourage some queer people to use. Another explanation, minority stress theory,suggests that the experience and internalization of “social stigma based upon one’sminority group status,” is used to highlight how substances serve as coping mechanisms(Flentje et al., 2015:100). For example, the embeddedness of heteronormativity andgenderism22 within social institutions, cultures, and communities may lead some queerpeople to use substances to cope with those traumas (Weber, 200823). However, while23 Weber (2008) found that queer people who were considered to have a substance use disorder had oftenexperienced heterosexism and internalized homophobia; Hostile school environments (Pollitt et al., 2018),familial rejection (Felner et al., 2020), and communal rejection (Slater et al., 2017) have also been shown toimpact suicidal ideations and substance use (Hatchel et al., 2019).22 Genderism refers to a system that both awards primacy to heterosexuality and emphasizes the “oftenunnamed instances of discrimination based on the discontinuities between the sex/gender with which anindividual identifies, and how others, in a variety of places, read their sex/gender” (Browne, 2004:332). Putmore simply, genderism is the belief that there are only two genders (i.e., male and female) and theexpectation that one’s gender should reflect one’s sex assigned at birth or suffer ramifications (e.g.,victimization) for failing to do so.21 For example, in conducting a meta-analysis, Marshal et al., (2008) found that compared to theirheterosexual peers, gay, bisexual, and lesbian young people were 190% more likely to engage withrecreational substances.20 Additionally, symbolic interactionism, embedded within contemporary learning and culturaltransmission, as well as control and strain theories, emphasizes how behaviors are shaped throughsocialization(s) (Mead, 1967) in addition to the various meaning-making processes (e.g., substance use)that structure how people navigate their environments (Blumer, 1986; Miller and Miller, 2014).19 For example, research has suggested that the lack (or weakness) of ties (or bonds) to elements of society(e.g., school or family) can free people to offend and use substances (Hirschi, 1967); In addition, lowlevels of self-control can remove internal constraints (e.g., an internal dialogue) that would prevent peoplefrom using drugs (Gottfredson and Hirschi’s, 1969).40some have considered the experiences of those who thrive outside of the gender binary,such as nonbinary or genderqueer people, there is still an overall paucity of research thatconsiders the experiences of nonbinary people in particular (Connolly and Gilchrist,2020; Rimes et al., 2019). Although work by Langenderfer-Magruder et al., 2016 andNewcomb et al., (2020:11) found that rates of substance use were higher for nonbinaryparticipants assigned male at birth (AMAB) than nonbinary people assigned female atbirth (AFAB) and transgender men, Rimes et al., (2019) found that there were nodifferences between these groups. As such, more research that includes nonbinary peopleis needed as the unique experience of having an identity that thrives outside of the genderbinary may impact how some navigate social space, substance use, and identityformation.Although it is important to consider how experiences of victimization can shapeintroductions to and justifications for some queer substance use, the reliance on aframework in which victimization leads to negative coping through substance use hasproduced a controlling (Collins, 1990) narrative of queer substance use as inherentlyrooted in victimization, stemming from experiences of (ab)use or otherwise harmful andnegative incidents (Race, 2009). Furthermore, the consolidation of queer identities asembodiments of risk may complicate how some queer people approach or navigatesubstance use (Nygren et al., 2015; Dwyer, 2015).41CHAPTER 2: METHODOLOGYQUEER CRIMINOLOGY AND QUEER CRIMINOLOGICALAPPROACHESFeminist, queer, and queer criminologists tend to gravitate towards qualitativemethodologies for several reasons (Panfil et al., 2022). Queer qualitative approaches24emphasize positionality to drop the charade of objectivity (Greenbank, 2003) and canhelp assuage the inherently unequal power relations in conducting research (Collin,1990). For example, rather than considering the researcher or the academic as the onlysource of knowledge, the participant is transformed from the identity of “the researched,”into a (co)collaborator (Collins, 1990). In doing so, the queer qualitative researcher doesnot “give voice” to the (co)collaborator, asserting their own meanings to the experiencesof the collaborator; Rather, they amplify their voice(s), highlighting their uniqueprocesses and knowledge(s). Similarly, queer qualitative approaches’ ability to “movebeyond the limits of categorization and statistical correlation” (Panfil et al., 2022:197)can deepen explorations of meaning-making processes or contextual factors that areparticularly important to criminological contexts (Rogers and Rogers, 2023:469).Moving past the normative “add queer and stir” incorporation into existingmethodological paradigms (Ball, 2014; but see also Buist and Lenning, 2016:7), scholarshave suggested the development of queer informed approaches in addition to a“queering” of the field, more generally, as imperative to any criminological research(Panfil and Miller, 2014; Rogers and Rogers, 2022). To “queer” something refers to the24 With roots in symbolic interactionism, queer approaches emphasize how people develop from socialinteractions and contexts (Woods, 2014). Specifically, symbolic interactionism aligns itself to aqueer-informed approach in its recognition of the dynamic social processes of identity formation,behavior(s), and positioning of gender and sexuality as socially constructed (Stein and Plummer, 1994;Plummer, 2003).42destabilization of ingrained and preconceived notions of gender and sexuality, and apotential solution to the historical and contemporary paucity of work that includes genderand sexually diverse peoples (Ball, 2014; Buist and Stone, 2014). As an approach, queercriminology moves past hegemonic binarizations of sexuality (Dwyer, Ball, and Crofts,2016) and gender (Valcore and Pfeffer, 2018) that often code queer communities out ofanalysis (Browne, 2008). Put more simply, a queer approach “invites the messiness ofresearch – its fluidity, resistance, unspecificity and lack of disclosure” (Grzelinska,2012:113). Because “mainstream criminologies could still be characterised asheteronormative” (Dwyer, Ball, and Crofts, 2016:2), queer criminologists have suggestedthat queer informed approaches may be an important site for intervention (Panfil et al.,2022; Ball, Buist, and Woods, 2014). More explicitly, it is a “diverse array ofcriminology-related researches, critiques, methods, perspectives, and reflections” (Ball,Buist, and Woods, 2014:2) that has been used to destabilize heterosexuality (Early andGrundetjern, 2022) and weaponized to “regulate” queerness (Ball, 2014:544).In this regard, queer criminological approaches exist without a rubric (Ball, Buist,and Woods, 2014), like other approaches, such as endarkened feminism (Dillard, 2000)and crip criminology (Thorneycroft and Asquith, 2021). Put more simply, there is not asingle or “true” way of defining queer criminological work. For example, controversy hasswelled around use of the word “queer” to question whether it denotes work centered onqueer communities or if it can extend to anyone who exists “outside” normativedefinitions of identity and behavior (Panfil, 2018:2). Largely, these perspectives arecaught in a tension between reifying hetero and homonormative categories asfoundationally distinct or risk “diluting demographically–relevant social differences” thatshape navigations (Woods, 2014:30). Regardless, expansive views of queer43criminological approaches recognize that there are “multiple ‘queer/ed criminologies’”(Ball, 2013:24). Furthermore, it may be more productive to encourage both“identity-based” and “deconstructivist” approaches to interrogate the importance ofshared identities in addition to who gets excluded based on identity (Woods, 2014).Importantly, qualitatively queer criminological approaches can also problematizehegemonic understandings of identities and behaviors (Panfil et al., 2022). For example,instead of framing substance use among queer communities in victimization-only andrisk-based frameworks (Race et al., 2017), a queer qualitative criminological approachalso considers how these experiences can be pleasurable (Power et al., 2018; Race, 2009),differ via social place (Gruskin et al., 2007) or context (Florêncio, 2021), and can impactidentity formation (Pienaar et al., 2022). As another example, Early and Grundetjern’s(2022:18) use of queer criminological approaches to analyze how cisgender heterosexualand queer women navigated compulsory heterosexuality within the ruralmethamphetamine market destabilized the innateness of heterosexuality and heterosexualdesire; largely in understanding how heteronormativity can be “constraining…even forthose who can benefit from and replicate normative structures,” this work underscoredthe importance of queering criminology as a discipline. In this regard, queercriminological approaches can trouble conceptualization of gender, sexuality, behaviors,and interactions with the criminal justice system.PRESENT STUDYDATA AND SAMPLEThis paper uses data from semi-structured interviews with 49 racially, ethnically,gender, sexually diverse, and self-identified LGBTQIA+ or queer people who have spent44time in queer social spaces to explore how they define and navigate queer andheterosexual social spaces. Conducted in the fall of 2019-fall of 2020, most of theinterviewees were located in the United States and two were in the United Kingdom25.Before the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, four interviews were completed inlocations selected by participants (e.g., a queer coffee shop). Recognizing that somequeer people may feel more comfortable in queer social spaces (Holliday, 1999) or maynot be openly queer (Dindia, 2013), the decision to have participants select where toconduct the interview was a queer informed choice. Subsequently, the remaininginterviews were held virtually through mediums chosen by participants (e.g., Zoom,Instagram call, phone call).Rather than consolidating their identities into succinct categories, all participantswere asked to describe their identities in their terms as part of a queer criminologicalinterview approach. Participants' ages ranged from 21 to 62 years of age and the averageage was 29 years old. As displayed in Table 1., of the participants, 55% were white, 19%were Latinx, 12% were Mixed, 10% were Black, and 4% were Asian. In regards togender, 34% were cisgender women, 26% were nonbinary, 22% were genderfluid, 8 %were transgender, 4% were cisgender men, 2% were queer, and 1% was genderqueer.Considering sexuality, 24% were queer, 20% were gay, 20% were pansexual, 12% werelesbian, 8 % were bisexual, 6% were asexual, 4% were questioning, and 2% werepanromantic.TABLE 1.

The author, a Black queer woman andqueer criminologist, has extensive training in queer and feminist approaches which aresensitive to and prioritize the experiences of people who have been marginalized26. Forexample, having spent a significant amount of time in one queer social space that hosts26 For example, I have given several guest lectures, designed three workshops, and have written on theimportance of including queerness in the classroom and research.47drag shows, I initially attempted to recruit in this environment. While some mightconsider my previous relationship to be a potential source of bias, a queer criminologicalapproach recognizes my history as an invaluable insider’s asset (Panfil, 2022). Althoughthe connectedness of local queer communities certainly rendered me as an outsider, myidentities further complicated this matter and transformed me into an insider/outsider(Dalton, 2016). As a Black queer woman, I am hyper-aware of the violent and intrusiveacademic surveillance of my communities; and as a queer person, more generally, I findqueer social spaces extremely important. For a researcher, sampling within theenvironment under study is a strategic approach that should be utilized. Yet, as a queercriminologist, I hold various identities and the conflict between them, meaning, the Blackqueer woman and the researcher, has provided a reflexive conundrum. Ultimately, Idesisted from that approach to prevent jeopardizing the safety of that place for me andother queer people.At this point, you might be wondering why I felt uncomfortable recruiting fromwithin a physical queer social place vs. comfortable doing so in a virtual queer socialplace. Although I am still wrestling with this question, I can offer some initialintrospection. To put it simply, attending and recruiting from a virtual drag show felt lessintrusive. Similar to research on cyberbullying, virtual communications can be structuredmore easily than in-person interactions (Ging and Norman, 2016). For example, whilephysically recruiting requires the interaction between me and another queer person ondisplay, recruiting virtually can limit the publicity of that interaction. For example, aftershows had concluded, I directly messaged performers who, if they wished, couldblock/ignore my messages. In-person, however, it might be harder to ignore my presenceand my physicality could make that environment uncomfortable. Furthermore, the48decision to recruit virtually limited the risk of losing my or my potential participants'access to that space because of this ability.Although queer criminological approaches facilitate the co-production ofknowledge, this research, just as all research is not “value-free” (Greenbank, 2003:798),and was undoubtedly shaped by my identities. As an example, while all participants wereaware of my queer identity, one participant admitted that they had almost worn a binderto the interview to “look more queer” and justify their inclusion in the study.Furthermore, and in line with a queer informed approach’s rejection of the roteessentialization of identities (Panfil and Miller 2015), this work explicitly askedparticipants what their identities meant to them. For example, while the term “nonbinary”typically refers to a person’s gender, one participant used it to refer to their sexuality as“nonbinary lesbian.” Similarly, while it is common to ask participants of color about theirrelationships to their race or ethnicity, white participants were also asked when they firstunderstood that they were white. In this regard, a queer criminological informed approachallows me to disentangle assumptions and hegemonic epistemologies.RECRUITMENT AND INTERVIEWSParticipants were recruited from a four-pronged effort informed by a queerapproach. Although a few participants were recruited from fliers placed at mainstreamqueer locations (e.g., queer coffee shops), the majority were recruited via personalnetworks, queer virtual groups or performances on social media, and snowball sampling.For example, as a member of several queer Facebook and social groups, I was able toeasily post and distribute my fliers. As another example, while the pandemic forced allqueer establishments to physically close down, queer social spaces were recreated49virtually in digital drag shows and hangouts. Observing this phenomenon, I attendedmore than 17 virtual drag shows (and one queer play), took field notes, and askedperformers if they would be interested in being interviewed.Three out of four of the interviews conducted in-person were done at a queercoffeeshop where the participants felt comfortable meeting me. As another queeringapproach to research, I invoked my “insider status” by using language such as “we” and“our community” in all recruitment information to denote that I am queer (Miller andPalacios, 2017). All participants were told prior to the start of the interview that I wouldbe unable to offer financial compensation.The semi-interview guide (Appendix A) was also developed from a queerframework, which emphasizes the importance of a participant’s own definitions ofinterview topics. As an example, rather than asking “what is your gender” or “what isyour sexuality,” participants were asked “how they would describe” their identitycharacteristics. In asking the question phrased as “how” rather than “what is,” theinterviewer assumes that gender, for example, is not fixed and allows for an intervieweeto answer freely and draw from their own definitions. To consider the role of substanceuse and space, the participants responded to questions such as: “How would you describea LGBTQIA+ space?”; “What kinds of LGBTQIA+ spaces are there?”; “What do peopleusually do in LGBTQIA+ spaces?”; “What kinds of substances have you noticed peopleusing in LGBTQIA+ spaces?”; and “How does, if at all, your comfort shift when you usesubstances in queer versus heterosexual spaces?” Generally, the types of questionsexplored how each interviewee developed their queer identities, participated inrecreational substance use, entered queer versus heterosexual spaces, and used substanceswithin queer social spaces.50To further queer the research process, I ended interviews with an opportunity forparticipants to become the interviewer and ask me any question they wished. While a fewdeclined because they felt uncomfortable or nervous, most participants felt emboldened.Some topics that were discussed included questions about my childhood, coming outstory, use of substances in queer social spaces and places, my degree and what I want todo post-graduation, and challenges that I have faced as a Black queer woman andcriminologist. One of the most interesting conversations was centered on the sharedkinship between me and one of my participant’s coming out stories. After explaining thatit took approximately 7 years for me to come out, I was surprised to know that herparticipant similarly took several years for them to come out to their religious father. Thisconversation lasted 30 minutes after the interview’s conclusion. This simple act, that is,being interviewed by a participant, can help mitigate the inherent power imbalance byencouraging an exchange of vulnerability.Generally, interviews lasted one to two hours, with a few that extended past twohours. While it is common for the researcher to assign participants’ pseudonyms, in thisstudy, all participants had the opportunity to choose their own pseudonyms; participantswho were uninterested were given androgynous names. As suggested by Allen and Wiles(2015), allowing participants to choose their own pseudonyms disrupts some of theimplicit biases that may emerge in the researcher’s naming of participants (e.g., choosinga stereotypically “Black name” for a Black participant). Interviews were audio recordedusing a digital tape recorder owned by me and subsequently transcribed. To mitigate thepower imbalance between me and my participants, all participants had the opportunity toreview, edit, and procure their audio files or transcripts so that their story was properlyrepresented. However, no participants utilized this opportunity.51ANALYSISI, like many queer theorists (Panfil, 2022), used grounded theory, a method inwhich data collection and analysis are connected (Charmaz, 2014). Inductive analysis,which is the examination of emerging themes within the data, is the “primary” method ofanalysis for a grounded theoretical approach (Bowen, 2006:13). The analysis was, asManalansan (2014) would note, “messy.” Theoretically grounded work is “far fromlinear” as the researcher, in their continuous development of “hunches,” must alwaysreturn and (re)return to the data and notes (Wuest, 2012). Rather than sanitizing theresearch process, grounded theory forces “researchers to develop a tacit knowledge of orfeel” for their data that informs analysis (Suddaby, 2006:639).The interviews produced emerging topics such as the importance of queer socialspaces, the dangers associated with heterosexual social spaces, and the blurring of thetwo. Furthermore, sensitizing concepts27, such as portrayals in media or academicliterature that frame queer substance use as inherently abusive, sparked the project’sundertaking. My conceptual framework, as derived from sensitizing concepts (Bowen,2006), was further connected to my concepts and manifested from literature on space,place, social spaces, social places, queer social places, queer identity development, andsubstance use.To further analyze the data, all transcripts were uploaded and coded in Dedoose, aqualitative analysis software. In earlier stages of the analysis, basic tabulations werecreated for each participant that included all mentions of queer social places, heterosexual27 As described by Charmaz (2003:259), sensitizing concepts are the “starting points for building analysis”which help guide the research’s thinking and shape the research process. For example, the author’sexperiences in queer social space and place coupled with the routine portrayal of queer communities asintimately connected to substance use and the paucity of positive portrayals in literature suggested that aproject examining the intersection of queer identity, social spaces, places, and substances is imperative.52social places, identity development, substance use, and the various overlaps between andwithin concepts; these concepts were also reviewed alongside field notes that were takenbefore and during recruitment. Finally, and as part of an interactive process, thematiccodes were defined and refined into three central themes that highlighted the ways inwhich participants moved through queer and heterosexual social spaces, how substanceuse was impacted and utilized within social spaces, and how queer identities weredeveloped through social places and substance use.53CHAPTER 3: THE DEFINING, CONSTRUCTION,AND MESSINESS OF QUEER ANDHETEROSEXUAL SOCIAL SPACES AND PLACESINTRODUCTIONResearch has investigated the ways that spaces can be distinguished via symbolsand expectations for identity, culture, and behavior (Goffman, 1969). For example,primary queer social spaces, such as bars, clubs, and Pride parades (Demant et al., 2018;Felner et al., 2020), are often “marked” as queer by rainbow flags (Halferty, 2008:20;Wolowic et al., 2017), the use of “sexual languages” (Boellstorff and Leap, 2004:12; ascited in Pennell, 2016), and queer-coded music genres (Hubbs, 2007). Conversely,heterosexual social spaces are often distinguished in their absence of queer monikers andoften characterized as the wider “hetero-normative world” by some queer people(Valentine and Skelton, 2003:855). Although often positioned in opposition, queer andheterosexual social spaces are constitutive of and flow amongst each other. In otherwords, while queer and heterosexual spaces are poised as opposites, movements withinand between them can complicate this distinction.Focusing on the importance of spaces and places, this chapter will examine thedifferences, overlaps, and blurrings between queer and heterosexual social spaces andplaces. Drawing from a queer criminological framework, this chapter investigates theboundaries and the “messiness” (Manalansan, 2014:99) of queer and heterosexual socialspaces and places. While this project considers how social spaces are distinguished and54navigated, this chapter specifically asks: How are queer and heterosexual social placesdefined or distinguished by some queer people? In this regard, this chapter argues that theboundaries of social space and place can be simultaneously distinguished and blurred.This chapter makes two contributions to the literature on social spaces, places,identity, behavior, and queer criminology. In arguing that social spaces can bedistinguished via their functionality, gendered or sexual atmosphere, and notions of safetyand violence, this work suggests that social spaces are composed of social places that areimbued with unique identities that impact how they are navigated. Yet, while socialspaces do have distinctive elements, they can be intentionally or unintentionallydeconstructed by the navigations of those inhabiting them. Put more simply, it is arguedthat queer and heterosexual social spaces do not explicitly exist in a binary. Rather,boundaries that distinguish queer and heterosexual social spaces can be “messy” orunsettled as people move within and between them (Manalansan, 2014:569). Largely,from the physical construction to the various emotions or violences that a place can elicit,queer and heterosexual social spaces are sites of exploration, freedom, negotiation, andcontestation (Halferty, 2008).SPACE, PLACE, SOCIAL SPACE, AND SOCIAL PLACEDating back to Plato (360 BC) and Aristotle (n.d.), human geographers haveconsidered how surroundings can impact how people behave, feel, and attribute meaningsto their surroundings (Relph, 1976; Tuan, 1997). While both space and place are used tounderstand relationships of people to particular environments, some have consideredspace to denote more “movement” and elicit a “sense of [place]” (Withers, 2009:638).Others have considered the “dialectically” interrelation between the two as people55navigate spaces based upon meanings given to places and vice versa (Relph 1976; ascited in Seamon and Sowers, 2008:4; Schroer, 2021). Yet, the various technologicaladvances, as noted by Coleman and Collins (2006) and Agnew (2011), have collapsedthese distinctions into one category of “space.” As such, contemporary research isreflective of “space…[as] conquering place” (Agnew, 2011:5).Durkheim (1989; 1912) furthered the use of space as an analytical approachDurkheim (1989; 1912) to pioneer the notion of social spaces. In doing so, he consideredhow groups of people define, perpetuate, and transform hegemonic structures (Buttimer,1969; Reed-Danahay, 2019). According to this perspective, social spaces areenvironments composed of groups of people and are replicative of “social facts” orsocialized behaviors (Durkheim, 1989; 1912; Schroer, 2021). Yet social places, asdescribed by Oldenburg (1989:18), are “third places” where people gather to explore andbuild community. Furthermore, because these places exist outside of employment ordomestic spheres, social places are environments conducive to identity formation(Oldenburg, 1989). However, while social sciences has explored the ways in which“social space” is gendered (McDowell, 1983; Bondi, 1992), racialized (Hunter et al.,2016; Gotham and Brimley, 2002), and demarcated by sexuality (Knopp, 1992; Bell andValentine, 1995), the term “social place” is often reserved for class- or social-basedinterpretations; In other words, the interchanging of space and place has obscured theways in which meaning-making processes within a place structure how people navigatethemselves and their environments.56QUEER SOCIAL PLACES AND SPACESArising from the embeddedness of heterosexuality within social spaces, queersocial places are often distinguished in their encouragement of queer-specific languages,behaviors, symbols, music, and notions of safety (Stults et al., 2018; Pennell, 2016; Brettet al., 2002; Wolowic et al., 2017; Hubbs, 2007). Historically, queer social spaces tend tomanifest predominantly as bars or (night)clubs and were one of the few environmentswhere queer people could socialize and develop community (Demant et al., 2018; Race etal., 2017). As sites of resistance and “disidentifications” from heteronormative structuresand identities (Myslik, 1996; Muñoz, 1999:1); Adams, 2020), queer social spaces are aproject of “queer-world making” or the reimagining of places as affirming and upliftingof queerness (Holland-Muter, 2018:213). In other words, social spaces become queer inthe transformation of the very fabric of place and the dissolving of heteronormativeborders that mark queerness as deviant; it is the “creation of [queer] spaces without amap” (Yep, 2003:35).Considering the construction of heterosexual social spaces, Bell et al., (1994)suggests that all spaces, particularly within Western societies (Kirby and Hay, 1997), areheterosexual by default. Largely, the positioning of heterosexuality as “natural” creates a“(hetero)sexing of space[s]” that is structured by systems of power (Visser, 2008:1345;Valentine, 2003). For example, defining heterosexuality as synonymous with moralityand appropriate desire regulates gendered and sexualized behavior to privilegeheterosexuality (Hubbard, 2000; Rushbrook, 2002). Additionally, homophobia,transphobia, and violence are utilized as tools to synonymize place as heterosexual whichproduces sites of risk and vulnerability for queer communities (Valentine, 1993;57Violence, 1989; Adler and Brenner, 1992). As such, it is not that social places are“naturally” heterosexual. Rather, they are “actively produced and heterosexualized”through language, behavior, music, and notions of safety (Binnie, 1997:223; as cited inOswin, 2008:90).THE MESSINESS OF QUEER AND HETEROSEXUAL SOCIAL PLACES ANDSPACESSpaces, just as identities, are fluid (Love, 2017) and shaped by the people who arewithin them (Goffman, 1969). As such, places are “messy,” meaning, precariouslynestled within balancing acts of negotiations and concessions, that are often blurred andrematerialized (Manalansan, 2014; Bell et al., 1994). In this regard, explicitly comparingand contrasting queer and heterosexual social space can hide the movements andtransformations within social space (Oswin, 2008) and obscure the ways in which allspace can be “sexualized or desexualized by different people at different times”(Hubbard, 2000:192). More explicitly, if heterosexual spaces are not “restricted tohetrosexuality” and queer spaces may be heterosexualized (Bell et al.,1994:33; Casey,2004), then both spaces are in a state of constant subversion.Considering the queering of heterosexual social spaces, scholars have argued thatthe development of queer social spaces can be a form of queering space and place(Gieseking, 2017). Because queer communities were (and arguably are) expected to behidden or exist solely as a subculture, the visibility of queer social spaces functions as asite of resistance to, occupation, and transformation of heterosexual social space. Others,such as Bell et al., (1994:33), suggest that some queer identities can further queerheterosexual social space. Lipstick lesbians and gay skinheads, for example, adorn a58“heterosexual drag” that utilizes hyper-feminization and -masculinization to traverse andoccupy heterosexual social spaces unbeknownst to heterosexual people.Some scholars have also explored the mechanisms through which queer socialspaces can be heterosexualized. Drag themed events such as shows or brunches “mess”the overlapping of heterosexual and queer social place by transforming the latter into thecommodification of queerness (Rushbrook, 2002; Siddons, 2019; Patillo, 2022)28. Forexample, drag brunches are primarily advertised for heterosexual audiences asopportunities for “expose[re]” to queer culture and to make it “fun and festive like brunchcan be” (Patillo, 2022:n.p.); Branton and Compton, 2021). As another example,bachelorette parties are sometimes considered a heterosexual invasion of queer socialspaces because they are “site[s] of performative heterosexuality” and reminders of thehistorical inability for queer people to get married (Nelson, 2019:47; Branton andCompton, 2021).In line with research that has explored the identities of social spaces and places,this chapter expands on how queer and heterosexual social places are distinguished viatheir functions, gender and sexual atmosphere, and experiences of safety and violence.Additionally, this work furthers the queering of social places through an analysis of the“messiness” of space.RESULTSThe following illustrates the ways in which queer and heterosexual social placeswere distinguished by participants. While some noted that queer social spaces could28 Here, queer social spaces were transformed into sites for “urban, middle-class white men and women‘slumming’ (or touring) drag balls” (Heap, 2008: as cited in Baldor, 2019:421-422).59range from law centers to kink workshops, all participants highlighted bars, clubs, andPride parades as three of the main social spaces. These spaces were described as beingcaught in a tension between existing as a queer contrast to, and in a racialized andgendered homonormative parallel to, the wider heterosexual world. Conversely,distinctively heterosexual social spaces, such as sports bars or strip clubs, wererecognized in their functions as broader microcosms of the wider world. Generally, theseplaces ran parallel to the wider heterosexual world in their reinforcement ofheteronormative regulations of gender and sexuality.Participants presented four main themes to describe both queer and heterosexualsocial places. First, places were distinguished by their functionality for creating oraffirming queer communities and identities. Second, the freeing or constraining genderedand sexual atmospheres, constructed from and within environments, marked social placesas queer or heterosexual. Third, anticipations of danger within heterosexual social placesand expectations for security within queer social places complicated notions of safety andviolence. Fourth, while queer and heterosexual social places were distinguishable, theboundaries between them became “messy” or blurred by the shifting presence ofidentities inhabiting them.THE FUNCTIONALITY OF PLACEQueer social places were described as environments conducive to queeraffirmation and community building, and encouraged “queerness [to] live and not bethreatened,” as Noel explained. Some used religious motifs and romanticized languagesuch as “temple,” “worship,” and “sanctuary” to describe how queer social placesfunctioned as sites of respite from the wider heteronormative world. Generally, these60places were used to build out queer community and connections. Conversely,heterosexual social places were characterized by a compulsory and strict adherence togender roles, misogyny, and gendered language that reaffirmed the “naturalness” ofheterosexuality. Many immediately thought of “sexis[ism]...[and] just very misogynistictrauma,” as Vennox stated. In this regard, heterosexual social places stood in directcontrast to queer social places in their absence of a queer community or opportunities toexist as queer.Several participants explained that the construction of queer social places wasintimately tied to intentionality, love, and respect. As Harley explained, the placesthemselves elicited community building because they were “joyful…friendly…andwelcoming no matter what flavor queer you are.” Further detailing this functionality ofqueer social places, Rican said:I would describe it as safe. Almost like a temple…like [a] sanctuary, where youare being heard, you're being seen. You're being loved by who you are. You'rebeing worshiped by who you are…it's like you walk into a queer [social] spaceand people are like, ‘Yes! Yes!...Oh my God! I love what you're wear[ing].\"...It'sso inclusive. It's intersectional….It's what the world should be. The world shouldbe queer.Similarly, Vennox explained:Oh, my God, the best way I can think about is like heaven...the ultimate familyutopia…You are surrounded by these people that are like you, or…appreciate whoyou are as a person rather than, you know, your orientation or anything likethat…. But yeah, [a] queer [social] space, for me, is a sense of home…you'reaccepted for who you are. You have these people that…just welcome you with ahug.For Rican and Vennox, queer social places were places where they could feel comfortableand supported. While a sanctuary is often described as a place of rest and a temple istypically a religious establishment, Rican uses both to describe queer social places as61environments where queer people are “loved,” “seen,” and “worshiped29” for being whothey are; in this regard, queer social places are “inclusive” and “intersectional” in theirappreciation and support for queer identities and expression. Drawing from similarreligious motifs, Vennox believed queer social places were “like heaven” by creating an“ultimate family utopia.” As such, having a physical space where queerness is acceptedand queer people can exist as humans rather than oddities stands in contrast to someexperiences within the wider heteronormative world. In other words, rather thanencouraging a fixation on “[sexual] orientation,” queer social places allowed them to be“accepted for” who they are and created “a sense of home.”Heterosexual social places were not only recognized in their absence of suchaffirmations, but as replicative of larger systems of heteronormativity. As a result,heterosexual social places were not often described as within specific spaces. Becauseheterosexual social spaces were not often delineated, queer people marked them asconstants or barriers that must be overcome. As such, the omnipresence ofheterosexuality manifested in “the rest of the world…[as the] dominant culture, the norm,the default” and was an aspect that all queer people had “to traverse on a regular basis,”as Glen commented. Heterosexual social spaces were often framed in opposition to queersocial spaces. Some, like Azure, described them in relationship to constraint andrepression:I feel like a lot of straight spaces or heterosexual spaces…just tend to have anaversion to things that seem weird and expressive…feel like there's lessauthenticity when it comes to being expressive in some ways because people are29 Interestingly, this language of sanctuaries and temples queers the association of seeking asylum orsanctuary in religious establishments with the historical violence of religious establishments as placeswhere one can claim asylum or sanctuary with their historical perpetuation of homophobic and transphobicviolence.62restraining. Sometimes I feel like it's less celebrated so there's more restraint to beexpressive.Although often used in a disparaging way, Azure’s use of “weird” suggests that a centraldifference between queer and heterosexual social places stems from the inability to be“expressive” within heterosexual social places. Whereas queer social places were definedas and created from “weird[ness]” or queerness, these same identifiers are “lesscelebrated” within heterosexual social places. As such, “aversion to” “being expressive”trickles down to the expected behavior to inhabitants of heterosexual social places.CULTURES WITHIN SOCIAL PLACE AS FREEING OR CONSTRAININGThe atmospheres within queer and heterosexual social places were discussed interms of music, gendered and sexual behavior, symbols, and politics. Within heterosexualsocial places, the playing of simplified or “two-step” music, the hyper-feminization and-masculinization of its inhabitants, the gendering of bathrooms, and the visibility ofTrump supporters restricted the navigations of queer people. Queer social places, on thecontrary, were centered on the disruption of (hetero)normativity by promoting the musicof “queer icons,” wearing scant or sexual explicit clothing such as latex or leather, theadornment of queer specific symbols like Pride flags, and hosting queer civil rightsevents. As such, queer and heterosexual social places evoked specific feelings thatcharacterized each place as either freeing or constraining.Several participants explained that the atmosphere within heterosexual socialplaces forced queer people to monitor their language and presentation. Remy, forexample, explained that heterosexual social places can put queer people “on edge”because of the expectation to present as a cisgender heterosexual person. Illustrating63these encounters, Majic recounted receiving “sideways” glances whenever they were readas queer in a heterosexual social place. Some, like Robin, attributed these spatializedreinforcements to the belief that because heterosexual social places are “designed withonly cisgender heterosexual people in mind” they reject “the existence of any other kindof person.” Others, like Aspen, described these places as a physical construction ofheterosexual culture which he thought of as “boring, conventionally limiting,unimaginative…[and] really critical.” Dramatizing this dynamic, Rican offered:Heterosexual culture is mind blowing to me. I don't see it often, unless I'mwatching reality TV. So, I'm like, \"Wow.\" Like, it's so like, structured and it needsto be like this and like that. And \"I'm the man, so I must provide. I'm the woman Ineed to not be so bossy.\" And I'm like, \"Oh my god. Y'all better calm the fuckdown.\" \"Oh, I don't cry or whatever.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, Jesus. Oh, my God. Yes.You can. Let those tears flow babyyy.\"…It's cringy, honestly...And people are notlistening…So it almost feels like...they're in this one channel and it's like that onechannel only. And…when you start changing the transmission, they're like, \"Wait,what is happening? Oh my god. Oh, there's noises\" and you're like, \"Can you justtake a breather. You're gonna realize it's a lot calmer on the other side.\" I mean,maybe people find calmness in that structure…Yeah, it doesn't feel as flowy. Itfeels very stagnant.Using the satirical example of a “cringy” reality television show, Rican highlights therestrictions and dynamics that are constitutive of heterosexual social places. In thisspectacle, masculinity is constrained within the boundaries of being a “provid[er]” and aninability to show emotion. Conversely, women are portrayed as overly expressive andconcerned with being too “bossy.” If, as Rican describes, heterosexuality is stuck on “onechannel..[and]...one channel only,” introducing queerness or “changing the transmission”can introduce a panic within heterosexual social places. Yet, while some heterosexualpeople may “find calmness in that structure,” it can feel “stagnant” or “less flowy” tosome queer people. As such, Rican believes that heterosexual social places, and culture64more broadly, should divest from these strict adherences to gender roles to “calm the fuckdown.”The atmosphere within queer social places often drew upon popular notions of“camp,” meaning, an exaggeration or eccentric display of queer performance, dress, andbehavior. As Riley noted, queer social places “shouldbe…delicious…luscious…curtains…[and] it should ooze with…a sense of style.”Largely, these environments were considered formulaic in their physical construction thatencouraged gender expression and relied upon the use of queer symbols. For example,Pride, as a quintessential queer social place, encourages the visibility of queer kinksubcultures such as “leather and latex and mesh,” as Harley commented. Describing theatmosphere of a queer social place, Oakley joked about all of the “hairy legs” and “somesort of flag” that implied a sense of corporal and queer freedom. Blending physicalsymbols with physical appearances, Remy further described the atmosphere within queersocial places:I could be facetious and say that it's because of all the dyed hair and thetattoos…[laughter]...And the people wearing Elizabeth Warren support T-shirts.Just the little cues you get from people and the eye contact that doesn't linger in asexual way… you look at somebody and you're like, “Oh, you're one of mypeople.” …[it’s] this feeling of going inside the door and seeing those littlesigns…it could be a huge Pride flag on the wall or it could just be [that] thecashier has an undercut with dyed hair…just kind of knowing no one's gonna pullany shit in here.Remy’s “facetious” comment details the atmospheric characteristics that mark queersocial places as queer. “Little signs” and symbols of nonconformity, such asmulti-colored hair, tattoos, and an employee with an undercut, signaled to them that theywere in an affirming and queer social place. Remy also noticed political or politicized65clothing, such as Elizabeth Warren shirts, also defined a place as a political liberalenvironment that they found reassuring. Other “cues,” such as non-expectant and platoniceye contact, which was off-putting within heterosexual social places, further convincedthem that they were in a safe environment. Through the use of queer symbols andembodiments, queer social places created a reassuring atmosphere for Remy, and otherqueer people, that within these places, “no one [would] pull any shit.”SAFETY AND VIOLENCEGenerally, spaces can be read as safe or threatening via their physicalconstruction, the kinds of behaviors or languages they elicit, and the presence ofparticular people. Because queer social spaces are often smaller than heterosexual socialspaces, they were considered more intimate and secure environments where queer peoplecould turn off their “sensors,” as Skyler explained. This notion of safety within queersocial spaces was destabilized, however, by the racialization and genderism that mediatedthe experiences of queer people of color and those who thrive outside of the genderbinary. In comparison, heterosexual social places were marked as transactional anddangerous environments inhabited by people who were always “tryna get ass,” as Suricommented. Additionally, the presence of cisgender heterosexual men or being read asqueer further characterized these spaces as unsafe. In this regard, anticipations andexpectations complicated notions of safety and violence within queer and heterosexualsocial spaces.Largely, the inability to use certain language or the types of reactions toalternative forms of gender or sexual expression transformed heterosexual social placesinto environments antithetical to queerness. Vein Gogh, for example, explained that if66two perceived cisgender men walked into a heterosexual social space holding hands, theywould be met with ignorant comments such as “she’s a he.” Thinking about how hedescribed his gender in heterosexual social places, Archer explained that he “always”used trans rather than genderqueer because heterosexual people “have a hard timeunderstanding things outside of that realm.” Majic explained that heterosexual socialplaces forced them to be “much more aware of” their queerness because, as Adriancommented, it’s difficult to be…visibly…affectionately queer.” Further thinking aboutthe intersection of queer visibility and safety within heterosexual social spaces, Archerremembered:The only time I've ever been drugged was at…[a] straight sports bar…And I wasin drag. It's whenever I get in straight spaces, even just holding hands with an exof mine, walking down the street, [and]…having people yell stuff at us…And forsome reason, it [queerness] inspires hostility in people….I know that and I'velived it and I've experienced it. I have to have my guard up in those spaces. I'mnot saying you can't be drugged at a gay bar or a queer bar, it has absolutelyhappened to people, but it's not like the norm for me. Whereas when I go to thesestraight sports bars, I feel like the norm is something bad's probably gonna happenand I gotta be careful.Archer’s experiences highlight the trauma, violence, and fear that some queer peopleexperience while navigating heterosexual social places. Being drugged at a “straightsports bar” while in drag and “having people yell stuff” at him and his ex functioned asphysical and verbal reminders that being visibly queer is dangerous in theseenvironments. Put more simply, Archer’s embodiment of queerness, recognized throughqueer practices (drag) or queer-coded behaviors, was marked as a “hostil[e]” threat toheterosexuality and, therefore, heterosexual social places. Yet, while he recognized thathe and his ex could be victimized in queer social places as well, he, as many others,67anticipated that they would be victimized within heterosexual social places. Largely, theseplaces demanded that queer people had to “be careful” or suffer the consequences.Some heterosexual social places were also coded as racially traumatic andfrustrating for several queer people of color. For example, Rock always describedheterosexual social places in terms of white cultural stereotypes such as “a bunch ofChads and Karens complaining about when they're gonna get their order.” Commonlyassociated with racist homophobic or transphobic white cisgender heterosexual men andwomen, Rocks use of the terms “Chad” and “Karen” invokes a “particular constellationof entitled white supremacy and class privilege” that reinforces white heterosexuality(Negra and Leyda, 2021:350). Similarly considering the ways in which race complicatesheterosexual social places, Glen remembered what it was like to be a Black lesbiannavigating a Black cultural house at a historically (white) women’s college:I had more difficulty…at [the Black cultural house] and being accepted by mystraight sisters who didn't want anything to do with me 'cause I was queer. Thatwas a bigger problem for me because…I wasn't expecting [it]; I was expectingwhite folks to be white folks. I was not expecting to not have the safety of [theBlack cultural house]...That was not a safe space for me, unless those lesbianstook it over for a dance on a Friday night or so….Outright…And [there were]subtle messages [and] constant talk about guys. I remember…somebody said tome, “You probably won't be very happy here,” ...I wasn't welcomed there,shunned…The people wouldn't say hi to me.Although the Black cultural house was created to be a safe haven for all Black people at ahistorically white women’s college, it was transformed into a site for heteronormativeexpulsions. While Glen had expected to be victimized by “white folks [who were going]to be white folks,” being “shunned” by her “straight sisters” destabilized her notion of a“safe space.” Contingent upon sexual orientation, and the “lesbian takeovers” on Fridays,the Black cultural house became an embodiment of sometimes “outright” or “subtle68messages” and “constant” heteronormative conversations that rendered her queerness asunwelcome.In comparison, the queer social spaces were often considered safe because of the“intention[s]” of the space and the people inhabiting it. Robin explained that queer socialplaces are explicitly “organized” around the desire for queer people to “gather and besafe.” Thinking about the importance of safety within these environments, Rican said“it’s fucking awesome” because queer social places are rooted in queer people“being…more safe around each other.” Generally, these forms of security manifested inusing gender affirmative language and “celebrating being queer,” as Zola noted. Thesedynamics were further reinforced in the actions of queer people protecting their spaces.For example, consider the experience of Hayden who recounted an uncomfortableinteraction with an assumed cisgender heterosexual man in a queer social place:I never felt like I was in any danger 'cause I knew that there were other peoplearound me that were gonna back me up and that were going to help me getthrough the situation…I definitely noticed some other people at a table watchingintently…they were on their toes. They looked like they were ready to attack ifsomething went down. So like I felt really safe in that space…people had myback.While the interaction with an assumed cisgender heterosexual man momentarily madeHayden feel unsafe, the presence of other queer people mediated these emotions.Although they had no prior relationship with their watchful guardians, they felt confidentthat other queer people would help them “get through the situation.” In this regard, thethreat of victimization at the hands of the cisgender heterosexual man was dissolved byqueer solidarity empowered through a queer social place. Put more simply, because queersocial spaces attract and cater to queer communities, Hayden’s unpleasant interactionwith the cisgender heterosexual man did not detract from any notions of safety. Rather, it69reinforced the space's safety in creating an opportunity for other queer people to haveHayden’s “back.”However, genderist and racialized violence destabilized the safety of queer placesand complicated the experiences of those who thrive outside of the gender binary andqueer people of color. Generally, cisgender gay (and often white) men own the majorityof queer environments, and some queer people with alternative identities felt unwelcomewithin some queer social places. For example, Azure, a pansexual person, recognizedthese places as “alienating” because the places were evocative of and were saturated withcisgender gay men making “penis jokes.” Tanner, a transmasculine nonbinary person,explicitly avoided “mainstream” queer or gay male social spaces because they would getharassed about their bathroom choice or be ignored if they were coded as a cisgenderwoman. Others, like Danny, a nonbinary person, were told by cisgender gay males thatthey could be gay but not “trans and gay.” In this regard, many, like Sayer, a genderfluidperson, questioned whether queer social spaces were “really even safe spaces anymore.”Further thinking about the spatial dynamics within queer social spaces populated orowned by cisgender gay men, Tobin explained:One of the examples that I can think of gatekeeping people about being trans is ifyou don't experience gender dysphoria, you're not a “real” trans person. Or, if youdon't wanna surgically transition, you're not a “real” trans per[son]... X, Y, and Z.Or if... You're not nonbinary if you are fine with your body.According to Tobin, cisgender gay men within queer social spaces perpetuate a form of“gatekeeping” that uses homonormative frameworks to define who is “a ‘real’ transper[son].” Gender dysphoria30, for example, is often used as a common trope to define the30 Gender dysphoria is a medicalized and pathologizing term used to describe distress in relation to genderassigned at birth vs. current gender (Dhejne et al., 2016); it is often used to reproduce the very [violent]cissexist ideologies employed by medico-legal establishments in the regulation of trans bodies (Edelmanand Zimman, 2014:678).70experiences and identities of those who thrive outside of the gender binary assynonymous with corporal discomfort. Similarly, the expectation for trans people to“surgically transition” reinforces the binary linkage of gender to specific genitalia.While gender and sexual violence perpetuated by cisgender gay men certainlystructured notions of safety within queer social places, the whiteness embedded withinthese environments further complicated the navigations of queer people of color. Gen, forexample, struggled with defining a queer social place because, “back in the day…all theadvertisements were [for] white [people].” Joking about this disparity, Vein Gogh alwaysbet on whether they were “the only Black person in the room.” Black drag performers,like Rock, witnessed white drag performers doing Blackface without any repercussions.Others, like Aspen, experienced “dozens of” racialized interactions such as beingrandomly asked if he has “the BBC31” by white cisgender gay men. To avoid“racism…[and] fetishizations, which also comes from…entitled white gays,” as hedetailed, several participants sought out specific queer social spaces that catered to peopleof color. Explaining this importance, Azure said:I feel most comfortable as a Black queer person in queer spaces that arespecifically designated for people of color, just 'cause I feel like there's a lot oftokenism that happens [in white queer spaces]…I feel like there's been a lot ofthose spaces that have been unapologetically….If you're white, you better betipping higher…You better be buying more drinks, better be tipping thebartenders better…we are here not to…appease the white sensibilities, but we arehere for Black people and for people of color just to feel comfortable in their ownskin in a queer space…we are here...to celebrate our own culture and celebratingthat in drag because people don't always get that…if people perform beautifulnumbers all in Spanish…I enjoy the spaces where they're unapologetic about it.31 The term BBC, meaning, “big Black cock,” can be “traced back to colonialism” where all Black malepenises were hyper-sexualized, and marked as objects of forbidden eroticism (Stacy and Forbes, 2022:374).71Spaces that were “specifically designated for people of color” mitigated “a lot of [the]tokenism” that can happen in general, or in white, queer social spaces. By explicitlyrejecting pandering to “the white sensibilities,” queer people of color spaces, asdescribed, can subvert racialized power dynamics through the expectation for whitepeople to tip “higher” and purchase “more drinks.” Furthermore, the spatialization of an“unapologetic” attitude prioritizes the cultures of queer people of color and can redefinequeer social spaces as racially safe. In this regard, drag, as a performance art rooted inBlack and Brown cultures, is reclaimed through singing “beautiful numbers all inSpanish” and placing the responsibility of translation on others. As such, intentionallyqueer spaces of color make it possible for “Black people and for people of color just tofeel comfortable [and safe] in their own skin.”THE MESSINESS OF SPACE AND PLACEAlthough the majority of participants were able to distinguish queer fromheterosexual social spaces, these boundaries were often “messy.” For example, while thecharacterization of spaces or places as “queer” was used to mark them distinct fromheterosexual social spaces, the overwhelming presence of white gay men problematizedthis consideration. As another example, some participants believed that queer socialplaces could be created in and actively transgress the boundaries of heterosexual socialspaces. Yet, the creation of heterosexual social spaces within queer social spacesproduced a tension between a perceived invasion or a potential avenue for allyship.While several participants used the words “gay” and “queer” interchangeably inreference to identities, others suggested that queer and gay social places werefundamentally different. For example, gay social social places invoked images of whitecisgender gay men who, in their proximity to masculine and white privilege, regulated72what kinds of bodies were allowed to inhabit spaces. Thinking about this distinction,Azure explained that queer social places have “more than just gay [white] men” becausethey celebrate “a variety of people of races…trans people…lesbians…and other queerpeople.” As such, the expectation for queer social spaces to be intersectional andinclusive explicitly made a place queer. Further contrasting queer and gay social places,Riley states:Queer spaces, to me, invokes a kind of utopian like a José Muñoz kind ofsense…really teasing out exploring, playing with the possibilities when it comesto different kinds of sexualities, different kinds of gender embodiments, transembodiments, that includes fashion, that includes clothing, that includes likeexpression in those ways… I think of also…a radical inclusion and…radicalanti-racism and radical acknowledgement of class and other kinds of difference,disability, etc. [Because]...the world at large…can be deeply oppressive…in queerspaces, there should be an effort to counter those things and find pleasures that areon the other side of them.Constructing a “utopian32” image, Riley describes queer social places as sites of“exploring” and “playing with the possibilities” of queer existence. For example, theencouragement of “different kinds of sexualities…[and] gender embodiments” coupledwith a commitment to “radical inclusion” positions queer social places as welcoming incomparison to gay social places. In widening his critique to include “the world at large,”Riley suggests that queer social spaces and places have a responsibility to “counter” orchallenge “deeply oppressive” structures and allow queer people to “find pleasures.”This discussion of queerness as a tool to transform place, rather than an inherentproperty of a social space, was also extended to heterosexual social spaces. Describing32 Jose Muñozis a Cuban American queer theorist famous for coining the term “disidentification” todescribe how queer performance arts, such as drag, and embodiments are created from the transformationof heteronormative regulations of appropriate gender and sexual identities or behaviors.73queerness as an embodiment of subversion, some, like Provvidenza, explained that “evenjust occupying a space” could queer heterosexual social spaces. For example, while gunranges are often associated with “crazy Trumpers,” “Nazi white supremacists,” and“pro-police type people,” Maddox’s queer gun club’s frequenting of these environmentsmade them more accessible for queer people. Rather than having to traverse thisenvironment alone, they felt safer and more secure with other queer people present. Inthis regard, it was often the presence of other queer people that created queer socialplaces “anywhere,” as Rican commented. Underscoring this notion, Provvidenza said:Honestly, anywhere is a queer space if you make it…I think that subversion canlook a lot of different ways. I think to me, it is like being in a public space. And Ithink that queerness is still a bit dangerous…And I think that even…a coffee shopand just putting a bunch of queers in it…It's a coffee shop but it's like underneathit all, there could be these sort of new intimacies forming, whether it's friendships,whether it's flirtation across the room…I love queer people and I think that we area silly people, so, even something like getting your coffee in the morning feelslike a subversion sometimes.Reminiscent of Bell et al.,’s (1994) characterization of all public space as heterosexual,Provvidenza’s imagery of “a bunch of queers” in a coffee shop highlights how“anywhere” can be made into a queer social space. Because being queer is “still a bitdangerous,” navigating heterosexual social spaces can be tricky. Yet, through theformation of “new intimacies” or subtle “flirtation[s] across the room,” the presence ofqueer people can transform the “mundane” behavior of getting a coffee into an act of“subversion” (Manalansan, 2018:500).Although the occupation of heterosexual social space by queer people wasconsidered a form of rebellion or transgression, the presence of heterosexual peoplewithin queer social spaces was often read as an invasion or heterosexualizing presence.74Recognizing that “the crowd was not queer [and] was overwhelmingly straight,” Jadenstopped frequenting a particular queer social space. Some, like Finley, adopted aparticular “fuck you” attitude towards cisgender heterosexual men within queer socialspaces as their presence created a “lesbians titillating straight men” dynamic. As anotherexample, Tanner noted a “taking up [of] a lot of space” or heterosexualization thatoccurred when heterosexual people entered queer social spaces:So, when the neighboring bars would close at 2:00am, there would be a largeamount of drunk straight men that would come to this queer space. And…thatwasn't what their intentions were. And I feel like it is probably safer for straightwomen to go drink and be more free in a queer space?...And also [the] excessivedrinking…can also turn into disrespect for the space very quickly because ofpeople being, \"I'm safer here, so I'm just going to get…completely blackout drunkand do damage to the space or have something bad happen to me,\"...I feel there'sthis illusion that it's a safer space and that because that's known, [it] draws peoplethat behave in a predatory way.Although there’s an “illusion” that queer social spaces are “safer” thanheterosexual social spaces, the flocking of “drunk straight men” and women complicatedthis perception. According to Tanner, cisgender heterosexual women used queer socialspaces to “drink and be more free” whereas cisgender heterosexual men brought ill“intentions.” As an example, because cisgender heterosexual women felt morecomfortable in queer social spaces, some would get “blackout drunk and do damage tothe space.” As a whole, these behaviors created a “disrespect for the space very quickly”and centered queer social places on the interactions between cisgender heterosexual menand women.Yet, a few believed that the idea that heterosexual people in queer social spacesfunctioned to heterosexualize queer social spaces was problematic and reflective ofhomonormativity. For example, because queer identities can manifest differently, Sayer75questioned how anybody could know if “somebody’s straight in a queer space.” Theyalso believed that the hyperregulation of queer “gatekeepers” was “worse” than thepresence of cisgender heterosexual people in queer social spaces. Others, like Rock,suggested that the inclusion of cisgender heterosexual allies could strengthen queer socialspaces rather than function as a site of heterosexualization:If you have a good [heterosexual] dude…and they are a good ally and on yourside, and that will fight for trans rights, fight for gay rights, all of the above, andthey know their lane, I don't see any issue with it. I have a drag daughter who is aheterosexual man, and he does drag. I think it's amazing because he knows hisprivilege as a white cis-het male. He knows his place in society and he knows thathis voice can travel very far…and he knows drag culture and its history…And Ialso think of like bachelorette parties for example. They tip a lot, I'm not gonnajudge a bachelorette party any day of the week. They tip us, they make us happyand they cheer for us the most. That is also fact...I fully stan bachelorette partiestoo. They're amazing.Rather than suggesting that all cisgender heterosexual people disrupt queer social spaces,Rock said the ways in which they interact with queer cultures and places should defineaccess. For example, their drag daughter’s respect for drag culture, history, andrecognition of his “privilege as a white cis-het male” justified his inclusion in queersocial spaces and places. Furthermore, they suggest that incorporating a “good ally”within queer social spaces could further the “fight” for queer civil rights. Similarly,Rock’s applauding of bachelorette parties for being an financial or supportive asset ratherthan an invasive presence further underscores the messiness of cisgender heterosexualpeople’s inhabitation of queer social space. Largely, their comment suggests that perhapsplaces themselves do not explicitly become queered or heterosexualized by the presenceof particular people. Rather, this process is contingent on the delicate balance ofrespectful engagement versus harmful co-optation.76DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONAlthough research has examined the ways spaces can be distinguished viasymbols and expectations for identity and behavior, few have explicitly considered theways in which this manifests within queer and heterosexual social spaces and places. Forexample, while queer social spaces are often described in relation to the presence ofqueer or “sexual languages” (Boellstorff and Leap, 2004:12), heterosexual social spacesare often marked in the absence of queer monikers or manifestation as the wider“hetero-normative world” (Valentine and Skelton, 2003:855). While queer andheterosexual social spaces are defined in contrast to each other, the navigations of queerand heterosexual people between and within them shapes how social spaces and placesare perceived and defined. As such, queer criminological analysis highlighted how somequeer people distinguished between queer and heterosexual spaces and places andexplored the mechanisms through which the boundaries become “messy.”Generally, participants used four themes to discuss queer and heterosexual socialspaces and places. While queer social places functioned as affirming and conducive tocommunity building, heterosexual social places were marked as hyper-regulatoryenvironments critical of queer identities. For example, some queer people explicitlyrefused to go to heterosexual social spaces to avoid being read as queer or forced tomonitor their use of queer-coded language. In comparison, the majority of participantspreferred queer social spaces and places because they were politically liberal, recognizedin their use of queer symbols such as Pride flags, and celebratory of nonconformity. Assuch, participants distinguished queer and heterosexual social spaces and places viaatmospheric differences that coded each environment as either welcoming or inhibiting.77Third, while queer social places primarily invoked feelings of safety and security,heterosexual social spaces were considered sites of anticipatory violence and trauma. Thesmaller size of queer social spaces, for example, produced an intimate environment whereparticipants felt safe and respected. In comparison, heterosexual social spaces wereconsidered “predatory” and dangerous because of the presence of cisgender heterosexualmen. Although it may be easier to consider queer social spaces and places as completelysafe, the various manifestations of racism and genderism that queer people of color andthose who thrive outside the gender binary complicated this notion.Fourth, while queer and heterosexual social spaces and places were easilydistinguishable, these boundaries were “messy.” Although queer spaces were not createdfor cisgender heterosexual people and labeled as such, the presence of white gay menchallenged this characterization. In this regard, some only defined queer social spaces andplaces as queer if they were centered around the intentional inclusion ofnon-homonormative identities such as trans and queer people of color. Others highlightedthe messiness of social spaces through queering heterosexual social space by occupyingheterosexual social space. Yet, the occupation of queer social space by cisgenderhetrosexual people produced a “messy” tension between their presence as an invasion ora potential avenue for allyship.In sum, this work expands the literature on social spaces, places, identity,behavior, and queer criminology. The examination of the distinctions of social spaces andplaces emphasizes that social spaces and places have unique identities and are imbuedwith identity-driven expectations. Additionally, while these distinctions certainly impacthow some queer people navigate queer and heterosexual social spaces, movements within78and engagements with spaces and places produce a tension between contestation andreconciliation.79CHAPTER 4: USING SUBSTANCES ANDSTRATEGIC USE WITHIN SOCIAL PLACES ANDSPACESINTRODUCTIONDrug consumption is shaped by social contexts that can encourage or discourageuse (Goode; 1970; 1972; Becker, 1963). Nestled within social places, social contexts arecomposed of expectations for identity and behaviors (Zinberg, 1984). As such, substanceuse in one context might be advantageous or anticipated (Zinberg, 1984; Turchik, 2009).For example, because the predominant cultural and historical social places for queercommunities are bars, clubs, and parades which are dependent on the consumption ofsubstances (Demant et al., 2018; Hunt et al., 2019), some queer people use substances tobuild community. While literature on substance use within queer communities hassuggested that queer people are more likely than their heterosexual counterparts toengage in substance use (Koeppel, 2015; Marshal et al., 2008; Talley et al., 2010), thesocial contexts of and places in which queer substance use occurs are rendered a “passivebackdrop” (Jayne et al., 2016:117).Rather, these higher rates of use within queer communities are often explainedthrough frameworks of victimization and (ab)use (Felner et al., 2020) that suggest thatthe stress of being queer33 within a heteronormative world can encourage some to copethrough substance use (Mereish et al., 2017). As such, while this work has highlighted the33 However, what is unique to queer people is the overlapping experience of “identity concealment”(McConnell et al., 2018:2), where the conscious or subconscious suppression of a queer identit(ies),coupled with homophobic or transphobic disenfranchisement(s), can force some queer people to grapplewith internalized homophobia, “a common manifestation of minority stress” (Hatchel et al., 2019:2); Forexample, some queer people of color must simultaneously navigate racial/ethnic discrimination in queerplaces and homophobic stigmatization(s) within their racially/ethnically similar communities (McConnellet al., 2018).80ways in which some queer people use substances, the common characterization of queersubstance abuse as inherently risky can eclipse other valid experiences. For example, ifthe behavior(s) of queer people, particularly queer people of color, are labeled anembodiment of risk (Nygren et al., 2016; Dwyer, 2015), these frameworks may not besuitable for understanding queer substance use.Scholars have suggested that substance use is more acceptable within queerrelative to heteronormative populations (Demant et al., 2018; Race et al., 2016).Similarly, research has explored the ways in which substance use is intimately linked toqueer identity formation (Race, 2009). As “technologies of the self” (Foucault, 1988:18),using substances can chemically assist corporal and psychic transformations (Foucault,1988:18; Pienaar et al., 2020) and the transgression of normative expectations for identity(Race et al., 2016). Furthermore, some queer people use substances strategically tonavigate their environments such as consuming to feel “more queer” or to feel morecomfortable in heterosexual social places (Demant et al., 2018).The centrality of social places informs how some queer people approachsubstance use. While the “party n’ play” atmosphere within queer social places canencourage substance use (Van Hout et al., 2019), hegemonic regulations of gender andsexuality within heterosexual social places can deter some queer people from use(Gruskin et al., 2007). Because substance use can lower inhibitions (Hunt et al., 2019),some queer people feel safer using substances in queer social places and avoidanticipated physical or linguistic violence within heterosexual social places (Hunt et al.,2019). In this regard, investigating social places can highlight the strategies andnavigations of queer substance use.81This chapter explores the ways in which social places impact queer substance useand navigations. In doing so, this work utilizes a queer criminological framework to askone question: How do social places shape how substances are used by some queerpeople? In doing so, this work argues that different kinds of social places and contextscan produce particular kinds of substance use through building community or expressingsexuality, for example. Additionally, this chapter suggests that some queer people usesubstances strategically to navigate or experience different social places such asdeepening connections to queer social places or divesting from heterosexual socialplaces.Largely, this work can inform a breadth of literature around queer criminology,substance use, social contexts, and social places. Emphasizing the spatialized centrality ofsubstance use among many queer communities (Hunt et al., 2019; Southgate andHopwood, 1999), this project can illustrate the importance of social places in shapinghow some queer people approach substance use. Specifically, the use of a queercriminological framework details how social places, and the social contexts within them,can inhibit or encourage queer substances. Furthermore, because all place outside ofqueer social place is constitutive of heterosexual social place (Bell et al., 1994), little isknown about how queer people approach substance use (outside of coping) within theseenvironments. As such, this chapter highlights that substance use, in general, is notsynonymous with (ab)use. Rather, it can be a strategic tool to traverse and interact withdifferent social places.82SOCIAL CONTEXTS OF DRUG USELiterature has examined how a person’s psyche or “set,” “settings” (Zinberg,1984:1), and social contexts (Duff, 2005; Okamoto et al., 2014) can impact substanceuse. While much of this work has focused exclusively on “historical and structuralfactors” that impact substance use, post-structuralists have emphasized the importance ofcontextual factors and meaning-making processes that structure substance use itself(Duff, 2007:504). For example, Goode’s (1970:23) analysis found that people oftensmoke marijuana in gatherings of close or personal groups that create “a kind ofsubcommunity.” Now, while the chemical properties of marijuana certainly shape userexperiences, he emphasizes that the social context of use can facilitate identification andbonding over the process of using marijuana (Goode, 1970).In other social contexts, substance use may be inaccessible or dangerous, whichcan limit or structure use. As an example, because alcohol can lower inhibitions andincrease vulnerability, some queer people actively avoid drinking in heterosexual socialplaces to limit physically or linguistically violent interaction (Gruskin et al., 2007; Huntet al., 2019). In this regard, social contexts, as an interplay among or “an assemblage of”places, can encourage or inhibit substance use behaviors.QUEER SOCIAL PLACES AND SUBSTANCE USEIn particular, social places are important for those whose identities have beenmarginalized, such as queer people. For example, the historical violent regulation ofqueer identities or queer-coded behaviors, apparent in homophobic laws and orstate-sanctioned violent police raids (Agee, 2006), limited the ability of queer people tosafely congregate (Hill, 2011). As such, queer social places were created for queer people83to gather and cultivate a sense of community (Hill, 2011; Race et al., 2017). Historically,these places have predominantly manifested as bars, clubs, and, more contemporarily,parades (Demant et al., 2018; Felner et al., 2020). Largely, the importance of queer socialplaces is rooted in the ability for queer people to “step out of the hetero-normative world”and exist within an affirming environment (Valentine and Skelton, 2003:855). Yet, whilequeer social places are commonly associated with substance use, little research hasexplored how this overlap and the particularities of social contexts within queer socialplaces can impact queer substance use.Social places can facilitate substance use (Goode, 1970; Duff, 2007). Recognizedas safe environments, queer social places can offer temporary freedom or respite from theheteronormative fabric of society (Stults et al., 2017; Adams, 2020). As such, becausesubstances can lower inhibition and increase a sense of vulnerability, some queer peoplemay feel more comfortable using substances within queer social places than inheterosexual social places. Similarly, because bars, clubs, and parades are consideredsites for substance use, consuming substances are undoubtedly part of the experience offrequenting such environments (Parks et al., 1998). Coupled together, these socialcontexts within queer social places can produce spatialized expectations or evenpressures to participate in substance use. As one young queer person in a study byDemant et al., (2018:10) noted, within queer social places, “there’s a lot of ‘we’re gonnacelebrate’ and there is…a lot of substances.”While social contexts within social places can encourage or inhibit substance use,substances themselves can be constitutive of social places. Many queer social placesshare an almost symbiotic relationship with substances. A queer bar, for example, cannotexist without the successful distribution of alcohol (Hunt et al., 2019). Similarly, efforts84to make a Mardi Gras parade in Australia drug free failed because queer-party attendeesspecifically attended to use substances and amplify their experiences (Southgate andHopwood, 1999). Furthermore, the dependency of queer social places on substanceconsumption is heightened by the manufacturing of a “party n’ play atmosphere” (Hunt etal., 2019). For example, the booming music and vibrant light displays within queernightclubs can encourage the use of stimulants so much that they have “become a normalpart of going out to clubs and dancing” (Duff, 2005:6). In this regard, substances andsubstance use define and are fundamental to queer social spaces; they have also “broughtinto being” queer social places (Race et al., 2017:43).INTENTIONAL AND STRATEGIC USE OF SUBSTANCES ACROSS PLACESSubstance use literature frequently defines use as synonymous with (ab)use (Reid,2012). Here, all use outside medical regimes is reduced to a state of immateriality andfrivolity (Race, 2009). Coping, for example, is a common theme within queer substanceuse literature that suggests that queer people consume substances as a response tovictimization related to their gender and sexual identities (Felner et al., 2020). While aqueered understanding of this process would suggest that this form of coping is a toolused to navigate the wider heterosexual world, common narratives position this behavioras risky and maladaptive (Race et al., 2016). Additionally, while some queer people maydefine their own use as problematic (see Meriesh et al., 2014), the commoncharacterization of all queer substance use “as an escape from an oppressive social order”can eclipse the equally valid, agentic, and strategic ways in which substances areconsumed. Put more simply, considering how substances can be used strategicallyunderscores “the agency of drug users” (Race, 2009:166).85Attributable to the wider acceptance and normalization of substance use withinqueer communities (Lea et al., 2013), some queer people have explained that usingsubstances is part of queer culture and social places (Demant et al., 2018; Hunt et al.,2019). Referring to the importance of substances for queer people, a young queer personin work by Demant et al., (2019:10) explained that substances function as an “access cardto” queer communities and social places. In this regard, some queer people strategicallyuse substances to bond and build community. As another example, the use of multiplesubstances within queer Chemsex sessions34 can help some queer participants navigatesocio-spatial expectations such as prolonged sex over the course of days (Van Hout et al.,2019; Ahmed et al., 2016).Although a small yet growing body of research has emphasized the strategy ofusing substances to navigate queer social places, little research has explored how somequeer people use substances to navigate heterosexual social places. For example, whilework has found that some queer people actively abstain from using substances withinheterosexual social places (Gruskin et al., 2007; Hunt et al., 2019), little is known abouthow some queer people use substances within heterosexual social places. As such, thischapter considers how substance use can build or be constitutive of social places, can beinfluenced by social contexts, and be strategically used to navigate social places.RESULTSThis section describes the ways in which queer and heterosexual social placesinfluenced how participants approached substance use. Although nothing physicallylimited participants in engaging in substance use in either type of social places, some34 Chemsex sessions are gatherings where substances are used to enhance sexual activities (e.g., havingprolonged sex with multiple partners).86used substances strategically, and social contexts either encouraged or inhibited use.Heterosexual social places, for example, were marked as dangerous places that wereexacerbated by the presence of drunk cisgender heterosexual men. In contrast, queersocial places were considered MOSTLY safe environments where queer people coulddrop their guards and indulge. Additionally, substances were also described asconstitutive of queer social places different from heterosexual social places that were tiedto queer culture, dependent on the consumption of substances, and encouraged queerconsumption.Considering these contexts and dynamics, participants described the overlapsbetween social places and substances in three distinct ways. First, social places werecharacterized as either encouraging or inhibiting of substance use. Second, participantsdescribed substances as constitutive of queer social places. Third, substances could beused strategically to navigate social places such as deepening relationships to queer socialplaces versus tolerating heterosexual social places. In sum, the distinct characteristics ofsocial places and contexts can produce specific kinds of navigations or experiences.SOCIAL PLACES AND SPACES AS FACILITATING OR INHIBITINGSUBSTANCE USEParticipants described the ways in which social spaces and places facilitated orinhibited their substance use. Heterosexual social spaces were often considered inhibitingtowards queer substance use. Largely, the presence of cisgender heterosexual men,exacerbated by their consumption of substances, within these environments createdhostile and violent atmospheres that made the majority of participants uncomfortable orfearful. Consequently, these perceptions were also recognized in the construction ofheterosexual social spaces which were untrustworthy and lacking accountability. On the87contrary, queer social places were characterized as safe and “freeing” environments thatencouraged some queer people to use substances.Several participants described the imperativeness of staying sober withinheterosexual social spaces. Kai, for example, explained that they could not “trust”heterosexual social spaces because they were “dangerous.” Some, like Peyton, rooted thisdistrust in the fact that heterosexual social spaces tended to be larger than queer socialplaces which created a lack of “accountability.” Further describing the danger of usingsubstances within heterosexual social spaces, Aspen commented:It's more hostile. It's more to look out for. I'm not as safe because I'm surroundedby more people [and] there may not be common themes or there may not be [a]sort of acceptance and I don't want my use of substances or anything to strip myawareness or to put me in a compromising position because...substances affect,you know, how you party. How you interact with people. So, I wouldn't want tobe in a position where…I'm engaging in something that I don't need to beengaging in or harmed in a way that causes more issues beyond me cussing outsome white gay [man] in the club, and because, to me, being in a hetero space ismore violent, it could be more violent.According to Aspen, heterosexual social spaces were more “hostile” because they areinhabited by heterosexual people. While queer and heterosexual identities do not exist ina monolith, his recognition that heterosexual people may not have “common themes” orbe as “accept[ing]” of queerness could approximate him to victimization. Usingsubstances further complicated his use of substances in heterosexual social placesbecause they could “strip” him of his “awareness” or potentially put him in a“compromising position.” As such, while using substances within queer social spacescould produce some tension, such as “cussing out some white gay [man],” consumingsubstances in heterosexual social spaces could be dangerous or “more violent.”88Further thinking about the ways in which heterosexual social spaces detersubstance use, some specifically pointed to the inevitable presence of cisgenderheterosexual men as dangerous or threatening. Marked as perpetrators of homophobicand trans violence, cisgender heterosexual men were characterized as an invasive andharmful presence. As a result, many, such as Archer, refused to use substances inheterosexual social places in an effort to “stay sharp” or vigilant. Further thinking aboutthe ways in which cisgender heterosexual men complicated queer substance use inheterosexual social places, Maddox said:Heterosexual spaces can especially…make me feel uneasy depending on what'sgoing on. If there's alcohol, if there's aggressive, especially aggressive men.Similarly wary of cisgender heterosexual men, Provvidenza explained:I don't really believe [that] straight men are possible of being good. So, I don'ttrust that if I were in a consciousness that wasn't super present, that I would feelsafe around straight people in general, but particularly men.Both Maddox and Provvidenza emphasize concerns around using substances inheterosexual social spaces. While Maddox generally felt “uneasy” within heterosexualsocial spaces, alcohol combined with the presence of “aggressive men” furtherexacerbated their fears. Similarly, Provvidenza’s disbelief that “straight men are possibleof being good” inhibited their use of substances largely because they were concerned thatthey would not be “super present” or able to take care of themselves.In comparison, the perceived inherent safety of queer social spaces facilitatedsubstance use for several participants. For example, Vennox explained that people usequeer social places “to purposely get drunk” because it is safer for them to do so withinthose environments. Correspondingly, Joan explained that she felt comfortable usingsubstances in queer social spaces because she was not concerned about safety:89I'm not worried about being raped in the queer space. I don't know why. I'm sure Icould be, but not worried about it in the same way…But I think that I've onlydone MDMA and queer spaces, because I haven't been as worried for my bodilysafety in the same way...I, for example, I use weed all the time for anxiety. I thinkof it as utterly separate from all the other drugs that I would use in a queer spaceor not a queer space, it's just different…But MDMA, definitely queerspaces…[because] gays love to dance so it's more fun to do MDMA in a [queer]club.Joan’s concerns for the proximity to sexual violence were more heightened inheterosexual social spaces and impacted how she approached using substances. Althoughweed was constantly used to manage her anxiety, MDMA was exclusively used in queersocial spaces because she was “not worried about being raped in a queer social space.”Although she was aware that sexual violence could occur in queer social places, the factthat they were queer indicated some sort of inherent safety that lessened the need to beconcerned for her “bodily safety in the same way.” Her account also hints at the overlapbetween substance use and functions of substances within queer social places. Althoughthere may be dancing in heterosexual social places, Joan used MDMA in queer socialplaces because “gays love to dance” and substance use facilitated “fun” in queer socialplaces.SUBSTANCES AS CONSTITUTIVE OF QUEER SOCIAL PLACESAlthough all participants emphasized that not all queer people use substances,many described substances35 as constitutive of queer social places. Referencing history,some discussed how queer social places manifested in response to the absence of genderand sexual affirming environments and encouraged “socializations…[through] a lot of35 The most commonly noticed and used substances in queer social spaces by participants were marijuana(weed), alcohol, cocaine (coke), methyl enedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA, molly, and ecstasy), alkylnitrites (poppers), methamphetamine (meth), heroin, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin mushrooms(shrooms), and ketamine (K). However, most participants explained that “club drug uppers,” or stimulants,were often more visibly consumed.90drinking and party drugs,” as Provvidenza explained. As such, several, like Riley,considered queer social places as “underground operation[s]” that have “historicallylinked substance use” to queer identities and expressions. Further detailing this socialcontext, Alfie said:Back in the day, the only way to express that queerness was to go to dark places,secret nighttime places…and that would be an experience where you could let goand lose your inhibitions and be yourself and not be fearful of the cis-heteroculture at large around you. And so, there was a required secrecy about it and thatlends itself to the bars in the '90s, and then it being a celebration of, \"Just do whatyou want.\" Part of that is drinking and celebrating and enjoying your life that way,and that's just sort of, I guess, carried into the present.The historic and violent regulation of queer communities, as Alfie describes, forced queercommunities to gather in “dark places” to avoid the “cis-hetero culture at large” that theyfeared. Because these spaces and places were born out of a “required secrecy,” theyproduced social contexts conducive to substance consumption. For example, as a shelter,queer social spaces were one of the few environments where queer people could “let go”and safely “lose” their “inhibitions.” In this regard, queer social places have always beenintimately tied to “drinking and celebrating and enjoying” queer life.Contemporarily, queer social places, predominantly manifesting as bars and clubs,remain constitutive of substances. Wren, for example, explained that all queer socialspaces “always” had alcohol and weed. Specifically explaining the relationship betweensubstance use and queer social spaces, Robin chalked it up to the fact that “drinking inthe bars…[is] what you do there.” In comparison, Azure suggested that queer socialspaces explicitly encourage substance use to “make money” and be recognized as “fun”environments. Some, like Rock, pointed to the connection between queer substance useand social spaces and places as reflective of physical embodiments of queer culture:91It's sort of apparent that the majority of queer spaces are centered around[substances], at least in the terms of it being a bar or a club. So that's sortof…what brings queer people together in queer spaces...in the queer communityin general. Also, yes…in queer comedy or queer culture, pop culture, those are[the] common concepts of “we drink a lot. We do poppers. We…” It's a wholeculture of it where you’re kind of like fucking the culture at large by just enjoyinglife and not worrying about it.According to Rock, queer social places are “centered around” substance use for severalreasons. On one hand, the predominance of queer bars or clubs as important socialcontexts for queer communities explicitly “brings queer people together” withinenvironments sustained on substance use. On the other hand, queer culture encouragesqueer people to “drink a lot” and “do poppers,” and frames queer substance use as adefiant act of “fucking the culture at large.” In this regard, the anti-assimilationist practiceof using substances, holding queer identities, and inhabiting space creates opportunitiesfor queer community building.Other specific queer social places, like drag shows or raves, also createdsubstance-friendly atmospheres through jokes about “pet skunk[s]” to refer to the smellof marijuana. Thinking about the ways in which substance use manifested in queer socialplaces, Azure said:I've done molly twice, both at a [queer] bar, but also it's just a, in general the raveparty where it's meant to be done…[in]...those kind[s] of atmospheres. I've onlydone coke twice and each time it was at an afters.On the surface, attending any kind of bar or party assumes some level of celebrationwhich is often coupled with substance use (Gilson et al., 2021). Yet, the specific socialplace of a queer “rave party” or “an afters” can further facilitate queer substance use. Forexample, raves are commonly known (and attended) for playing electronic dance or popmusic, genres commonly associated with drug use because of their energetic beats92(Salkind, 2018). Similarly, afters, social contexts that emerge after the conclusion of aprimary party, are social places in which stimulants like “coke” are used to resuscitateand recreate a party environment. In this regard, substances can be used to define or buildqueer social places. Furthermore, Azure’s use of molly in a queer bar and coke at anafters underscores the importance of queer social contexts and places in shapingsubstance use.STRATEGIC SUBSTANCE USE ACROSS QUEER AND HETEROSEXUAL SOCIALPLACESSeveral participants described using substances to navigate different social places.Substances were used to access queer social places and communities, intensify theirconnections to queer social places, and as a participatory aid in specific social contexts.Although substances were generally avoided in heterosexual social places, when usedthey functioned as a coping mechanism for having to be in that environment or to tuneout of the experience entirely. Largely, these results suggest that using substances can bea strategy or a resource to navigate social places and contexts.Using substances within queer social places was conducive for queer communitybuilding. Jaden, for example, used substances in queer social places “to be together” withother queer people. Joan, similarly, was actively searching for a “queer ayahuasca space”because she believed that social context would produce a “bonding and loving andconnecting” experience with other queer people. In this regard, substances were used todeepen connections to queer people and, as Riley detailed through his consumption ofmushrooms and molly, social places:[Using substances] is a way to heighten one's relationship to others and to thatspace, and do it in ways that are like, sometimes can be unpredictable…the way93that I experience drugs in a queer space is to heighten and to be more sensitive toand to be more kind of in tune with that space. And that's something I want to doin a queer space more so than I want to do in a straight space. I wouldn't want totune out of the queer space. I don't feel the need to be hyper-connected to[heterosexual social spaces]....To me, [that’s what] the best drug experiences do.Although coupling the term “unpredictable” with substance use could trigger negativeimages, Riley’s use emphasizes the ways in which substance use within queer socialplaces was freeing for some queer people. As hallucinogens, mushrooms and shrooms areoften used to intensify the experiences of their users. While Riley is uninterested in being“hyper-connected to” heterosexual social places, using within queer social places isdesirable because it can “heighten one’s relationship to others and to that space.” Putmore simply, he strategically used substances as a way to be “more sensitive to” and to be“in tune” with queer social places. As such, Riley’s suggestion that the “best drugexperiences” are rooted in being “hyper-connected to” one’s environment suggests thatsubstances can be an important tool for the navigation(s) of social place.Using substances also aided participant’s’ ability to engage in specific socialcontexts within queer social places. For example, the “litmus” test for “the success ofone’s night” within specific queer “afterhours” communities hinged on using substancesto “keep the night going,” as Riley commented. More generally, events or parties withinqueer social places were sites of prolonged interaction, stimulation, and stamina. In orderto keep up partying with their friends, Peyton would often “do one line” of cocaine beforegoing out dancing. Zola, who spent a lot of time in drag circles, noticed that dragperformers used substances to “stay up all night.” Detailing this particular relationshipbetween the social context of drag and substance use, Tanner explained:94I feel like there's a lot demanded from us in terms of….You know how manytimes I like, I'm getting into drag to go out and I don't fucking want to, I don'twanna do it…you have to kind of force yourself to go out and do it 'cause you'rebeing paid, you're working, and you have to be there. And if you bail consistentlyon performing, then that's gonna affect your career and work…And then, if mycall time is at 9:00…I have to start painting by 7:00-ish to get there on time. Andthen I'm there till bar close. So, and when you have performers that performfull-time, where this is their only work, I mean, you're constantly in a bar. You'reconstantly in this culture of partying and you're the clown. You're the mascot,you're the...You're that person for this scene. And it's just available. Like it's justthere. And in terms of having to deal with prolonged social interaction with largeamounts of people, I, people tend to drink more.Tanner’s story explains how substances are integral resources in the social context ofperforming drag within queer social places. Although there are situations in which theywould prefer to “bail,” they would “force” themselves to perform and remain employed.In navigating “prolonged social interactions” coupled with the requirement forperformers to remain until “close,” they used substances to exist within a constant“culture of partying.” As a performance art, drag is in itself an embodiment ofentertainment that can transform a person into a “clown” or a “mascot,” particularly infront of heterosexual audiences. As such, there is “a lot demanded from” drag performersthat can be exhausting and time consuming. Because substances are constitutive of queersocial places in that they are always “just available,” Tanner was able to use and “dealwith” the socio-spatial expectations of performing within a queer social place.Within heterosexual social spaces, some used substances to assuage the negativefeelings associated with being in that environment in the first place. Whenever Indigowould go to heterosexual social spaces, for example, they would drink heavily “to not beso on edge.” Similarly, in cases where their mom forced them to go to heterosexual bars,Rock would always take “back a ton of tequila shots” to erase their memory of ever being95there. In this regard, substances were used within queer social places to “tune out” ratherthan “tune in.” For some, this reaction was also contingent on the social context of theheterosexual social place. For example, while Riley generally avoided using substancesin heterosexual social places, he was comfortable taking DMT at a heterosexual HotSprings environment. Distinctly different from being within physically bounded spaces,such as a bar, being in an outdoor space, coupled with the requirement to be silent, helpedhim feel at ease:I actually took DMT for the first time and then we were doing some ketamine forthat trip up at a hot springs in Northern California. And it was like, you know,95% straight, but it was like, so lovely it was like, at night and like, the lights aregreat. And so anyway, so like, that was—I felt I did, but it was quiet. You have tobe silent. So that's like a different kind of, like sensory experience, right? Youdon't have to, like, interact with people…I don't know, I don't—yeah, it doesn't,like, excite me to like go into a straight bar and like, do a line in the bathroom andthen like, have drinks at the bar.Although the social context of drinking at “a straight bar” and doing “a line in thebathroom” is unappealing, a “95% straight” hot spring environment is conducive toRiley's use of substances within a heterosexual social place. For example, the expectationfor all attendees “to be silent” erased having to “interact” with heterosexual people andthe “lovely” atmosphere was ultimately enhanced via DMT and ketamine use. Put moresimply, it was the non-sociality within a specific social context of a heterosexual socialplace that produced a pleasurable and “sensory” experience.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONAlthough research has suggested that queer people are more likely than theirheterosexual counterparts to use substances (Talley et al., 2010), little work has examined96the social contexts and places in which queer substance use occurs. The primary relianceupon victimization frameworks that routinely categorize queer substance use, andsubstance use more broadly, as risky or inherently (ab)usive has obscured the ways inwhich social context, spaces, and places impact queer substance use. While it is importantto consider how some queer people use substances to cope with experiences of violenceor trauma, the predominance of this framing omits how social spaces and places can beconstitutive of substance use. Furthermore, this positioning neglects to explore howsubstance use can be important, strategic, and impact how people move through places.Largely, participants imparted three specific ways in which social spaces andplaces overlapped. Social spaces and places were described as either inhibiting orencouraging of queer substance use. Because heterosexual social spaces, for example,were considered dangerous or unwelcoming places, exacerbated by the presence ofcisgender heterosexual men, using within them could approximate queer people toviolence. In this regard, many participants avoided those spaces or felt that theirsubstance use was inhibited not only by the social context of drunk heterosexual men, forexample, but by the perceived lack of safety within the space itself. Queer social spaces,in comparison, encouraged queer substance use in their positioning as safe places wherequeer people could “let loose” and lose their inhibitions.Second, substances are constitutive of queer social places. Historically andcontemporarily, the predominant types of queer social spaces are bars, clubs, and parades.Several participants described how these places are entirely financially and sociallydependent on the consumption of substances. For example, queer bars often “pushed”alcohol sales because they wanted to “make money.” Others cited specific social contextswithin queer social places, such as drag shows or raves, in which substances were97described as part of the experience. As such, the intertwining of social spaces, places, andspecific contexts characterized queer social places as synonymous with substance use.Third, several participants detailed how substances could be strategically used tonavigate social spaces and places. Within heterosexual social spaces, substances wereused to assuage feelings of fear and uneasiness, and to “tune out” of the places. Substanceuse in queer social spaces, by comparison, was used to deepen and formulate connectionswith other queer people, increase stamina for participation within these places, andenhance the experience of being in a queer social place. In this regard, while substanceswere certainly used for general pleasure or recreation, participants’ use to navigate socialspaces and places highlighted the ways in which using substances can be an importantresource.Generally, this chapter adds three contributions to queer criminological, substanceuse, social spaces, places, and contexts literature. In considering the intimate relationshipthat some queer communities have with substance use, this work emphasizes theimportance of examining the social spaces, places, and contexts in which queer substanceuse can occur. Similarly, this chapter furthers the analysis, and destabilization, ofheterosexual social spaces and places through understanding how some queer peoplemove within them. Furthermore, the use of a queer criminological frameworkproblematizes the routine characterization of queer substance use, or all substance use forthat matter, as inherently (ab)usive or maladaptive. Rather, substances and queersubstance use can be strategic tools or resources for traversing social spaces, places, andcontexts (Race, 2009).98CHAPTER 5: DEVELOPING QUEER IDENTITIESTHROUGH SOCIAL SPACES AND PLACESINTRODUCTIONSpaces and places themselves can define “citizenship,” or who is accepted andwelcomed within them (Bell, 1995:140). From a dramaturgical perspective, people’snavigations of space and place are impacted by the other people inhabiting it, in additionto the expectations associated with the environment and its inhabitants. As particularkinds of space, social places are imbued with meanings associated with aspects ofidentity (Durkheim, 1893; 1912). Put more simply, social place impacts how peopleunderstand themselves and are sites for identity formation (Dieseking, 2017). Forexample, queer social places were created as an environment for queer people to gather,feel safe, and build resilience against a heteronormative world (Stults et al., 2018;Myslik, 1996). Here, queer social places, as created inside queer social spaces, provideopportunities for queer identity formation. On the contrary, the positioning ofheterosexuality as “natural” and queer identities as abnormal within heterosexual socialplaces can complicate or hinder the process of queer self-making (Martínez-Guzmán andÍñiguez-Rueda, 2017; Kirby and Hay, 1997). In this regard, queer social places may beintegral for identity formation for some queer people.The “social” aspect of social spaces and places can give people opportunities toexplore or formulate their identities through specific behaviors. Substance use withinsocial places, for example, can be a “binding mechanism” that imparts a sense of“togetherness, identity, and solidarity” within others in the place (Grund, 1993:109). Yet,99different types of social places can produce distinct ways in which substance use andidentity formation interact. For example, the intimate and historical linkage of queeridentities, social spaces, places, and substance use has larger implications for queeridentity formation. Within queer parades, substance use facilitates shared queerexperiences, “pleasure[,] and celebration” of queer identities (Southgate and Hopwood,1999:309). In other social contexts within social places, substance use can be utilized toperform queer identities. For example, some gay men use substances to heighten anddemonstrate their masculinity or virility within chemsex (Ahmed et al., 2016). As such,the variations of social places can inform how substance use interacts with identityformation.Drawing from a queer criminological approach, this chapter investigates the roleof social places and substances in developing some queer identities. Specifically, I arguethat different types of social places impact how queer identities are formed, enabled inpart through substance use. Utilizing a queer criminological framework, this workspecifically questions: How do different types of social places shape how some queerpeople use substances in identity building? This work explores how social places that areidentity-affirming create identity-building capacities, and how substance use can operatein validating and facilitating identity.QUEER IDENTITY FORMATION(S), SUBSTANCE USE, SOCIAL SPACES, ANDPLACESSocial places can impact how people understand themselves and form theiridentities (Dieseking, 2017). As people move within and between social places, theynavigate various socio-spatial expectations that are created and maintained by the people100already inhabiting that place (Goffman, 1956). Queer social spaces and places areconducive to queer identity formation because they are built by and for queer people,offer opportunities for community building, produce affirmative interactions, andfunction as safer alternatives to the wider heterosexual world (Stults et al., 2018; Myslik,1996). In comparison, heterosexual social spaces and places may complicate or even“straighten” queer identities via explicit or implicit reinforcements of heterosexuality asnatural or justify violence towards queer identities (Kirby and Hay, 1997). Bell (1995)describes this dynamic as representative of a spatial citizenship that dictates whoseidentities are welcomed and accepted. For example, the presence of cisgenderheterosexual identities within a queer social space may be considered a “(hetero)sexualizing” of queer place which can complicate queer identity formation within thatenvironment (Martínez-Guzmán and Íñiguez-Rueda, 2017).Generally, the “social” aspect of social spaces and places can provideopportunities for identity formation through shared behaviors. Substance use in socialplaces, for example, can create a sense of community or belonging which can bolsteridentity formation (Grund, 1993:109). Similar to the importance of substances incountercultures (Belser, 1991), substance use within queer social places functioned as a“technology of the self” through which queer people could deepen self-explorations ofqueerness (Foucault, 1988:18). For example, some queer people of color have suggestedthat substance use can help build resilience against the erasure of their identity inheterosexual social places that synonymize queerness with whiteness and queer socialplaces that reproduce racialized discrimination (Newcomb, 2014; Slater et al., 2017).101However, because social places can be facilitatory or inhibitory of differentidentities and behaviors, identity formation through substance use can look differentlyacross various social places. For example, Anderson, Daly, and Rapp’s (2009:315)analysis of the intersection of crime and masculinity found that the social context ofhetrosexual nightclubs created violent and “clubbing masculinities” among some malepatrons. Tying masculinity to excessive use of alcohol, competitions with other men, and“girl-chasing behavior,” some men participated in crime to prove their masculinity(Anderson, Daly, and Rapp, 2009:315). Yet, the messiness of queer social placescomplicates the notion that all queer social places are conducive to affirming queeridentity formation. For example, because queer people of color and trans people faceharsher penalties related to substance use than their white and cisgender counterparts,some queer people of color may abstain or avoid substance use regardless of whether itoccurs within a queer social space or place; this may also inhibit opportunities for queerpeople of color to use substances as a resource for identity formation. Similarly,substance use within queer circuit parties, as another example, are specific social contextsin which identity formation through substance use is often reserved for cisgender gaymen (Lee et al., 2004). In this regard, social spaces, places, and contexts can impact howqueer identities are formed through substance use.RESULTSThis section details the role of social places and substance use in queer identityformation. Generally, participants described social places and substance use as importantfor queer identity formation via in-group or out-group dynamics. In safe environments,some participants used substances within queer social places in the process of forming102their queer identities. On the contrary, because heterosexual social places were inhibitoryof queer identity formation, substance use within these environments functioned as a wayto manage queer identities. Yet, substance use in specific social contexts within queersocial places, such as parties that catered to cisgender gay men, complicated this binarycharacterization. In this regard, various social places and contexts produced distinct waysin which substance use interacted with queer identity formation.Participants presented three ways in which different social spaces and placesshaped how substances were used to inform queer identity formation. Withinheterosexual social places, some used substances to cope with being queer. As oneparticipant described, using substances allowed them to access and perform compulsoryheterosexuality rather than having to deal with potential backlash for being queer within aheterosexual social place. Others used substances in queer social places to deepen theirrelationship to queer communities, and develop or explore their queer identities.Interestingly, some suggested that these interactions were reflective of substances beingconstitutive of queer social places more generally. Because queer social spaces and placeswere built from and centered on substance use, several described substance use as anaspect of queer identity or culture more broadly. As such, queer substance use withinqueer social places was discussed as inseparable from queer identity formation. Specificsocial contexts further created intra-conflicts or considerations, however, that left some,like queer people of color, disenfranchised.103HETEROSEXUAL SOCIAL PLACES, SUBSTANCE USE, AND QUEER IDENTITYFORMATIONGenerally, participants discussed heterosexual social places as being constitutiveof the wider world rather than specific places. As such, several participants describednavigating systems of queer victimization, violence, and gender dysphoria arising fromnavigating environments that privilege cisgender heterosexual identities. One way thatparticipants navigated these environments was through substance use. While the use ofsubstances to suppress queer identities within heterosexual social places temporarilyinhibited queer identity formation, those experiences were considered integral in shapingsubsequent identity formation through substance use within queer social places.Similarly, some used substances as a palliative to navigate the various traumas that cancome as a consequence of being queer within a heterosexual social place. Othersdescribed substances as a pharmacological resource for self-acceptance or reinforcementof their queer identities. In other words, the overlap between using substances to informqueer identity formations within heterosexual social places was multifaceted.Some participants described using substances to manage or suppress their queeridentities and navigate gender and sexual expectations within heterosexual social places.Vennox, for example, drank heavily around and would “walk away” from familygatherings because family members would refuse to use their appropriate pronouns orwould ask when they were going to get a boyfriend. As another example, Zola often usedsubstances to get “a bit of a boost” and feel more “comfortable” being queer in aheterosexual environment. Others, like Peyton, a nonbinary lesbian, explicitly usedsubstances to blend in or acquiesce to compulsory heterosexuality:104Drugs were kind of like an escape…I always knew that I didn’t really likemen at all…I just felt like it was like what was expected of me and it wasvery easy. I had sex with a lot of men when I was younger and I feel likedrugs also factored into that but…I’ve always kinda grappled with that.I’ve had sex with so many men…it was just like a…a chase…I enjoyedhaving power over them because I wasn’t going to lose anything. I wasn’tgoing to catch feelings, but…doing drugs…would help me be able to dothose things instead of actually kinda getting into myself as a person…Iwas pretty much always drunk when I would have sex. And yeah, alsocoke sometimes…pretty often I was on cocaine too.Without citing a specific heterosexual social place, Peyton’s narrative highlights how thewider world can be interpreted as such. Although they always knew that they wereuninterested in men, Peyton “felt like” having sex with them was a way to do “what wasexpected” of them. They used substances, such as alcohol and cocaine,” to engage incompulsory heterosexual behavior rather than “getting into” their queer identity.Furthermore, Peyton’s lack of emotional investment in men created a form of “power”which allowed them to tap into this role because they were not “going to lose anything”or “catch feelings.”Others described specifically using substances in heterosexual social places toassuage feeling afraid, nervous, or apprehensive. Riley, for example, explained that heused to use substances to grapple with “severe anxiety” that sometimes accompaniedbeing queer in heterosexual social places. Illustrating where some of these emotions canstem from, Hayden said:To calm our nerves and to help our mental stability when it comes toacceptance… I think that we are definitely always in the state of like, arethey going to accept me? Are they going to accept me? And so we mightuse alcohol and substances to drown out those feelings where like aheterosexual person might not have those feelings and just does it for theparty, you know? So like, we're using it as like a... I don't wanna say amedication, but a medication of sorts.105Evident in Hayden’s description, some queer people may use substances for differentreasons than heterosexual people. Because, as Bell et al., (1994) suggests, all place isconstitutive of heterosexual place, navigating heterosexual social places while queer canbe difficult. In this regard, some queer people use substances as a type of “medication” tohelp with “nerves” and “mental stability.” In this regard, substances can be used to quietor “drown out” a constant concern with being accepted within heterosexual social places.Although all participants were proud to be queer, some discussed the stigma ordifficulties that emerged from navigating heterosexual social place and complicated theiridentity formations. Azure, for example, explained that using substances can be a way tomitigate being “out in public” or recognized as the “awkward” queer person. Detailinghow they grappled with holding a queer identity and existing within heterosexual socialplaces, Archer stated:Substance use in my life seems to be more so connected to trauma….itseems to be connected to my queer identity just in the fact that it hashelped me cope with the side effects of how being queer has affected mylife. And ways in which I've faced rejection and the things that havehappened to me because of that.Reflecting on being physically assaulted and harassed (as described in Chapter 4), Archerrooted their substance use as being “connected to trauma” associated with being queer inheterosexual social places. For example, they use the phrase “side effects” in relation tobeing queer which denotes queerness as similar to having a disease or a condition thatcan be treated through substance use. In this regard, using substances within heterosexualsocial places can help some, like Archer, “cope” with the experience of “rejection” inrelation to their queer identities.106QUEER SOCIAL PLACES, SUBSTANCE USE, AND QUEER IDENTITYFORMATIONAs safer alternatives to heterosexual social places, several participants foundsubstance use within queer social places to be profoundly transformative. Generally,substance use within queer social places helped facilitate opportunities to connect, deepenrelationships, and explore queerness. Some used substances to lessen anxieties aroundinteracting with other queer people in queer social places. Similarly, others used tobecome more comfortable identifying as queer and exploring queer desire. Describing theways in which substances could expand the mind, some used within queer social placesas a bypass for heuristic navigations learned within heterosexual social places. Ratherthan suppressing or hiding their queerness, some used substances to uncover or formdeeper relationships with their identities. Others discussed how substance use withinthese environments helped them become more comfortable with and confident in theirinteractions with other queer people. Furthermore, the recognition of substances asconstitutive of queer social places coupled with substance use within these environmentsfacilitated a celebration of queer identity for several participants. More explicitly, becausequeer social places are built from and centered on substance use and celebratingqueerness, participants' identity formation was undoubtedly impacted by these spatializeddynamics. In this regard, using substances within queer social places was a way for somequeer people to discover and develop their queer identities.Generally, substance use within queer social spaces and places was used todiscover, explore, and develop queer identities. For example, Hayden explained thatusing substances can help queer people with “letting go of ourselves and not feeling sotrapped in our own bodies.” Others, like Kelsey, suggested that substances could be used107to “crack open” queer identities and facilitate interactions with other queer people.Considering how they used marijuana within queer social places, Riley explained thathelped him strike up a “fun conversation with strangers or with friends.” Furthercommenting on how this dynamic informed their formation of their queer and dragidentity, Roses said:Cause drinking, that's the confidence booster…That's when I startedreally talking to people. That's when I was like, \"Hey, what's up? Howare you doing?\" That's when I actually really got out of my shell and likestarted actually talking to the queens and talking, like, \"Oh, I see youevery week. How are you doing?\"Within queer social places, Roses used alcohol as a “confidence booster” and a tool tocircumvent insecurities. For example, while they exited heterosexual social places andentered queer social places with a “shell” on, drinking helped them connect with “thequeens” or other drag performers over their previous or current performances. As such,Rose's use of alcohol within queer social places informed an aspect of their queer identityformation through relaxed interactions with other queer people.Other participants described the relationship between queer substance use, socialplaces, and queer identity formation as reflective of substances being constitutive ofqueer social places more generally. The linkage of queer social places and substances tothe formation of queer identities, as Azure explained, was a real aspect of queer culturethat “romanticizes about queer life” and identities as constructed from “going out to clubsand drinking and doing poppers.” In this way, queer social places, in their constructionsand meanings, impacted how some queer people formed their identities. Illustrating howthis manifested, Alfie commented:I would say alcohol is a typical part of queer spaces. I think part of it isthat those spaces are designed for losing your inhibitions and celebrating108and enjoying life with one another. It's not often that you're at a queerspace with under or work-minded... They're pretty much designed forcelebration, and so that's something that culturally goes along withcelebration. It is [the] alcohol and drugs too.As Alfie describes, substances, such as alcohol, are “a typical part” of queer social places.Rather than being “work-minded” or oriented, queer social places function as places for“celebrating,” “enjoying life,” and building relationships with other queer people. Alfiealso underscores the fact that because celebration, as an act, is commonly associated with“alcohol and drugs,” queer social places as “designed” celebratory environments canencourage queer people to use. Furthermore, because substance use can lower“inhibitions,” some queer people, like Alfie, using substances within queer social placeshelped dissolve barriers inhibitive of queer identity formations.Furthermore, a few participants described the overlap between queer socialplaces, substance use, and queer identity formation in terms of bonding, being understoodas queer, and having fun with their identities. Suri, for example, said that she usedsubstances in queer social places as a way to feel more “human,” which can provide afreedom to explore their identity and simply have “fun.” Similarly, Skyler explained thesefeelings as representative of a need to “gather over food or drinks” that can inform queeridentities through socialization. Discussing how substance use within queer social placescan create such opportunities, Adrian said:Drinking and it's a lot of seeing and being seen, kind of looking at eachother, laughing, flirting, watching drag shows or other queer kinds ofperformance, dancing…some drugs but also like talking and sharing,asking for help, validating each other.Within queer social places, substance use can inform identity formation by creatingenvironments where queer people feel “seen.” As a resource, substance use can facilitate109“validating” interactions, such as spending time with one another, “laughing,” and“flirting.” In this regard, sharing social place and using substances were ways to deepenrelationships to queerness through shared experiences with other queer people.SOCIAL CONTEXTS WITHIN SOCIAL SPACES, PLACES, AND IDENTITYFORMATIONSpecific social contexts within queer and heterosexual social places shaped howsubstances were used in queer identity formation. For example, while the coupling ofsubstance use and the engagement in queer or queer-coded behaviors for someparticipants ultimately informed their identities, doing so within a heterosexualenvironment or with heterosexual friends eclipsed initial formulations. For example,while some experimented with their gender and sexuality within hetrosexual socialplaces, those experiences were delegitimized by others and blamed on the substance use.Considering the racialization of social contexts, the use of substances within queer socialplaces complicated identity formations for several participants of color. The whitenessembedded within queer social places and society more broadly, for example, heightenedfears of becoming racialized stereotypes of caricatures that positioned substance use as acharacteristic of being a person of color. Furthermore, using substances within specificqueer social spaces, such as those catering to women, were also marked as catalysts forsolidifying queer identities for some queer people. As such, substance use across varioussocial contexts within social places can inform queer identity formation.Some social contexts within heterosexual social places shaped how someparticipants used substances for identity formation. Largely, the use of substances withinthese contexts was dependent on the identities of the additional people within the socialplace. For example, when Vesper and her friends got “super drunk one night” and began110kissing each other, that experience, later defined as her “first queer moment,” waschalked up as “girl play” rather than queer behavior because of their friendship and thegroup identification as heterosexual. Similarly describing how social context, substanceuse, and queer identity formation can manifest in heterosexual social places, Joan said:I was pretty heavily into binge drinking until that point in sophomore yearbecause I felt like it was a way for people to be comfortable with meexercising my identity. It was more comfortable for people to say, \"Well, Iwas also drunk so you and I making out wasn't a problem.\" And that'sdefinitely a middle space for a long time that contributed to confusion,even though I was comfortable in my identity because I would have areally intimate moment with someone and then they would turn around thenext day and say, \"Well, it was alcohol so that's how it is.\"...Similarly withdrugs, I would say that my experiences with acid have been similar in thatpeople are more willing to experiment and try things under thosecircumstances but then shy away or don't internalize the experiencesimilarly to me….I would say that, honestly, people were more likely toblame alcohol or use alcohol for means of experimentation or feelingcomfortable experimenting with me.Although Joan was comfortable with her queer identity, “binge drinking” and usingsubstances within a heterosexual social place was a way for self-identified heterosexualpeople to have queer experiences. For example, “experimenting” while using substancesproduced a social context that rendered queer behavior as excusable because everyonewas under the influence. So, while Joan would have a “really intimate moment,” the nextday would yield a “shy away” or “blame” reaction that was isolating. Similarly, while theheterosexual people in those cases used substances to “try things” with Joan, she alsoused substances as a way for heterosexual people “to be comfortable” with her“exercising” her queerness. As such, using substances within these social contextscreated a “confusion” for Joan that simultaneously made her queer identity visible andinvisibilized through heterosexual invalidation.111Social contexts within queer social places also impacted the ways in which somequeer people of color used substances to inform their identities. Often, queer social placeswere considered white queer social places, as they were predominantly owned andinhabited by white queer people. Several participants of color were cautious about publicsubstance consumption because of the unique experience of discrimination andsurveillance that people of color experience. Vesper, for example, worried that if she wascaught smoking marijuana illegally that the “repercussions” for her would be “different”in comparison to her “white blonde friends.” Others intentionally used substances withinthese contexts as a way to deal with being a person of color within a white social place.Describing how using substances to help relax and recharge from racialized encounters,Rickie and Aspen explained:It also…it helps to take off the edge—helps to have a good time. Yeah, ithelps to...Like to let go of some stuff that you deal with, even if it'stemporary, it's another form of escapism, honestly, I'm just like with avideo game where I'm usually just kind of just me...letting go.Similarly, Rickie noted:I was surrounded by a lot of white people…I would hear a lot of racistthings that I would let slide… because...also, yeah, cuz, also those peoplewere giving it to us for free. So, I just, I let a lot of things slide to be ableto use, I guess.As illustrated, using substances within a white queer social context can be an importanttool to protect the identities of queer people of color. Although queer social places,generally, are safe environments for queer identity formations in comparison toheterosexual social places, they can be victimizing for some queer people of color. Assuch, in order to maintain access to these environments, some, like Aspen, usedsubstances to “take off the edge,” “have a good time,” and “let go” of some racialized112encounters. Others, like Rickie, used substances within these contexts to sustain theiraccess to the social place and free substances, which helped them let “a lot of the racistthings” that they experienced “slide.” In this regard, some queer people of color activelyused substances within queer social places to be able to exist within white queer socialcontexts.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONWhile all places can impart which identities belong or are welcomed within them(Bell, 1995), social places, as unique aspects within social space, are intimatelyconnected to the formation of identity (Durkheim, 1893; 1912). For example, while theaffirmative nature of queer social places may be conducive for queer identity formation,heterosexual social places, as sites for queer victimization, can be inhibitive. As such,while research has explored the ways in which queer social places can impact queeridentity formation (Dieseking, 2017), this chapter explicitly considers the ways in whichqueer identities are shaped by heterosexual social places. Similarly, while substance use,as a common aspect of social places, is also an important mechanism for queer identityformations (Race, 2009), this chapter explores the ways in which substance use withinparticular social places can inform queer identities.Largely, participants described three ways in which different social places, andcontexts within them, shaped how their substance use impacted queer identity formation.Although specific heterosexual social places were not distinguished, participantsdescribed them as constitutive of the wider world. Subjected to heteronormativeexpectations for gender and sexuality, some queer people used substances to cope ormanage their queer identities. In this regard, substance use within heterosexual social113places inhibited some queer identity formations and helped some navigate thoseenvironments without having to grapple with identity. Similarly, some described thisprocess as a “palliative” or salve to treat the wounds that can occur with being queerwithin a heterosexual social place.Substances within queer social places, on the contrary, were used to connect,deepen, or explore queer identities. Rather than using substances to cope, substance usewithin these places helped expand the mental blocks that had previously limited someparticipant’s access to their queer identities. In becoming more comfortable withthemselves and interacting with other queer people, substances became a vehicle forself-acceptance and affirming relationships. Interestingly, and reflective of the results inChapter 4, the perception of substances as constitutive of queer social places alsoimpacted queer identity formations. For example, because queer social places were builtby and in celebration of queer identities through substance use, the act of inhabiting andusing within these environments encouraged some participants to celebrate their ownidentities.Third, specific social contexts within social places further complicated identityformations. While the use of substances within heterosexual social places occasionallyheld queer or queer-coded behavior, substance use became an excuse for that behavior,which ultimately detracted from some queer identity formations. In queer social places,racialized contexts created a tension between using to navigate racism and attempting toavoid conforming to a stereotype for some queer participants of color. As such, substanceuse across diverging social contexts within queer and heterosexual social places impactedhow participants understood and formulated their identities.114Generally, this chapter has investigated the role of different social places andcontexts in impacting how substances are used to develop some queer identities. In doingso, this work has argued that the interplay between social place, context, and substanceuse can encourage, manage, and inform the formation of identity. Furthermore, theintegration of a queer criminological framework can help interpret how substance use,particularly within affirmative social places and contexts, can be pleasurable, validating,and functional.115CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSIONCONCLUSIONSocial place can be a difficult and tricky phenomenon to study. Outside of itsconflation with the term “social space” or notions of status, it is often rendered static andimmovable. Yet, because social places have their own unique identities constructed fromand imbued by their inhabitants, they are in a constant state of fluctuation andcontestation. Often, the relationship with the identities of people is often the catalyst forthe creation of specific social places, like those within queer social spaces36. Furthermore,negotiations between the identities of social places and of the people within thatenvironment can shape how certain behaviors manifest, such as substance use. Althoughthere are other aspects that inform and shape queer social place-building, substance use iscentral to the formation of queer communities and some queer identities (Race, 2009).For example, while substance use is more acceptable across queer populations, queercivil rights movements and social places encourage a rejection of normative expectationsof identities and behaviors such as substance use (Hill, 2011). Similarly, althoughresearch exploring substance use has suggested that queer people are more likely to usesubstances than their cisgender heterosexual counterparts (Marshal et al., (2008); Talleyet al., 2010), much of this work is primarily focused on experiences of victimization and(ab)use (Race, 2009). Although there are certainly some queer people who use substancesto cope with experiences of victimization (Mereish, et al., 2017), the predominance ofthese frameworks has produced “controlling images” that present queer substance use asinherently maladaptive or abusive (Collins, 1990:69).36 As such, social places can also inform how identities are formulated.116Drawing from in-depth semi-structured interviews with 49 self-identified queerpeople who have used substances or frequented queer social spaces, this dissertationutilizes a queer criminological approach to tease out the complexities of social place,substance use, and identity formation. This work argues that social spaces, places,contexts, and substance use have implications for how people navigate theirenvironments and formulate identities. For example, because social spaces and places canbe racialized, sexualized, and gendered (Knopp, 1995), queer people, particularly queerpeople of color, navigate these environments based upon the meanings ascribed to them(Bowleg, 2013). In places that are affirming or created specifically for queercommunities, some may use tools, such as substances, to explore and develop their queeridentities (Power et al., 2018). In others, such as heterosexual social spaces and places,queer identity formation, particularly accessed through substance use, was inhibited viaheteronormative regulations of gender and identity (Newcomb, 2014). Yet queer socialplaces, as formulated within social spaces, existed and were created through theinhabitations of queer people (Bell et al., 1994).Normative explorations of space, place, substance use, queer identity formation isbridged with queer criminological approaches in several key ways. First, whereas humangeographers have distinguished place from space (Relph, 1976; Tuan, 1997), much of thecontemporary language used to describe the phenomenon of place has been replaced innotions of space (Agnew, 2011; Coleman and Collins, 2006). Yet, because spaces arecomposed of places which give spaces meaning, it is perhaps irrelevant to further debatebetween the two. Rather, it is more fruitful to consider how spaces and places constituteone another and become messy through the navigations of people (Rushbrook, 2005; Bell117et al., 1994). In this regard, this dissertation revitalizes and bridges together place withspace to emphasize how they are “dialectically” interrelated (Relph, 1976; as cited inSeamon and Sowers, 2008:4).Second, notions of space, place, and substance use are recognized as inextricablylinked to aspects of queerness (Southgate and Hopwood, 1999). For example,predominant historical and contemporary forms of queer social places are within spacesdependent on the consumption of substances (Hunt et al., 2019). As such, much of queeridentity and community building within queer social places are shaped by substance use(Duff, 2005). Similarly, space, place, and substance use are also intimately tied tocriminology as a discipline (Woods, 2014). While criminology is rooted in theclassification of queerness as a form of deviance, the field remains largelyheteronormative and the queer social spaces are largely understudied (Woods, 2014;Dwyer, Ball, and Crofts, 2016). As such, a queer criminological approach explores howthe existence of queer places as sites of contestation and negotiations of environmentalexpectations for identity or behavior overlap with aspects of the criminal justice system.Third, while the majority of research examining queer substance use is reliantupon victimization-only frameworks, a queer criminological approach also explores theways in which queer substance use can be pleasurable and differ via different socialplaces (Race, 2009; Gruskin et al., 2007). In doing so, queer criminological approachescan tease out the complexities of queer substance use such as how it can be used toinform identity formation. For example, using substances, particularly within queer socialspaces and places, can encourage some queer people to explore their queer identities(Hunt et al., 2019; Gruskin et al., 2007). As such, investigating the overlap of social118place, substance use, and identity formation suggests that using substances within queersocial places can facilitate queer identity formation for some queer people (Power et al.,2018).Fourth, while a significant amount of research has considered how queer peoplemove through queer social spaces and places, little work has examined how queer peoplemove through heterosexual social places. Similar to the ways in which whiteness hasbeen positioned as the backdrop to which all other people become racialized(Bonilla-Silva, 2010), heterosexual social space is the measure for which all other spacesare measured (Bell et al., 1994). As such, while it is important to understand thenavigation of people who have been marginalized and spaces or places stemming fromthat marginalization, only doing so risks further cementing this divide (Seidman, 2005;Rumens et al., 2019).Chapter 3 considers how queer and heterosexual social places are defined ordistinguished by some queer people. In doing so, this chapter describes the variousdefinitions, formulations, and navigations that can emerge between and within socialplaces. While queer social places can range from public (e.g., a Pride parade) to private(e.g., a person’s home) and were distinguished in terms of symbols, embodiments, andaffirmations, heterosexual social places were often unbound by physical boundaries andmarked as sites of victimization. Because spaces, similar to identities, are fluid in theirinhabitations, the movement of people can change how they are interpreted (Love, 2017;2016). The presence of heterosexual people within queer social spaces, for example, candestabilize that environment as a safe or queer place (Hartless, 2019). Similarly, the119presence of queer people within heterosexual social space creates opportunities for thecreation of queer social places within heterosexual social space (Hubbard, 2000).Furthermore, in theorizing heterosexual social places, this chapter has largerimplications for queer criminology. Specifically, the deployment of messiness is aqueered way of considering how the distinction of social place and space interminglewith expectations for identity and behavior. For example, although heterosexual socialplaces were considered hostile towards queerness, several participants described activelycreating queer social places within heterosexual social places. In comparison, thepresence of heterosexual people, particularly men, within queer social places encouragedsome, like Finley, to adopt a “fuck you” attitude that reified a spatialized expectation forthat environment to remain queer centered. While the study of queer social places hascertainly highlighted how some queer people understand and navigate their environments(Pennell, 2016), only doing so can reinforce the perception of heterosexual social place asnormative or the standard from which all other places are compared to. Explicitlyexamining heterosexual social places reflects queer criminology’s roots in queer theorywhich troubles heterosexual social place as natural (Rumens et al., 2019). In sum, thischapter emphasizes that social places do not exist in a binary, rather, they are messy andcan be sexualized and desexualized at any given moment (Hubbard, 2000).Exploring the overlap of place, social context, and substance use, Chapter 4’sconsiders how social places shape how substances are used by some queer people. Thepredominant focus on victimization can obscure the other ways in which queer substanceuse can be strategic and profoundly transformative (Race, 2009). While queer socialplaces produced substance use that facilitated community building and queer expression,120heterosexual social places mediated queer substance use. For example, becauseheterosexual social places were associated with intoxicated cisgender heterosexual menand anticipated or lived victimization, many queer people avoided using substanceswithin them. In queer social places, substances were constitutive and were central to thecreation and maintenance of place. Largely, queer people used substances within theseenvironments because they were considered safe and an expectation for existing within aqueer social place. As such, this chapter contributes to the small but growing body ofqueer criminological work on the functionality of substance use. Although research hassuggested that queer people may be more likely to use substances than heterosexualpeople (Marshal et al., 2008; Bowers et al., 2015), the importance of different types ofsocial places in which use can occur are rarely the focus of study (Jayne et al., 2016).Furthermore, social contexts, like the expectation of drinking alcohol within a bar,impacted how substance use was justified. As an example, rather than fixating on thenegatives of substance use, other queer criminological approaches have underscored thefunctional aspects of substance use within particular social contexts. Studies of chemsexhave highlighted how some queer people use substances to engage with environmentalexpectations to have prolonged sex (Ahmed et al., 2016; Van Hout et al., 2019). Othershave demonstrated how substance use can be pleasurable, validating, and functional increating and sustaining interactions with queer communities and social places (Demant etal., 2018; Power et al. 2018). In this regard, an integration of a queer criminologicalframework can help interpret how substance use and an underlying recognition of humanagency can emphasize how substance use, particularly within affirmative environments,can be an important resource and shape how people navigate their environments.121Finally, Chapter 5 extends Chapters 3 and 4 to investigate how social places canproduce distinct ways in which some queer people use substances to build identities.Although this chapter certainly extends queer criminological approaches to agency asdiscussed in Chapter 4, this chapter also considers how specific social places canencourage queer identity formation facilitated in part by substance use. While substanceuse within queer social places deepened or uncovered relationships to queerness,heteronormative expectations for identity within heterosexual social places producedsubstance use as a form of coping or management of queer identity. This comports withother work finding that those who thrive outside of the gender binary, such as trans andnonbinary people, are often subjected to genderist violence that can encourage substanceuse and complicate identity formation (Langenderfer-Magruder et al., 2016; Rimes et al.,2019; Newcomb et al., 2020). Similarly, some queer young people are regulated andpunished more heavily than their cisgender heterosexual peers which can also limitopportunities for affirmative identity building (Snapp et al., 2015). However, differentcontexts within social places further structured how substance use and identity formationsoccurred or were inhibited. The intertwining of drag culture and substance use (Tilleweinand Kruse-Diehr, 2021), for example, encouraged some to use and participate in a centralaspect of queer culture within queer social spaces. In a different context, such as beingwithin proximity to drunk cisgender heterosexual men in heterosexual social space, someworried about expressing their queer identities with and without the aid of substances.STUDY LIMITATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCHWhile this study makes several contributions to social space, social place,substance use, and identity formation literature, it also has some limitations that provide122directions for future research. While I initially began with in-person face-to-faceinterviews, the emergence of COVID-19 required the project to quickly pivot. Althoughin-person interviews are a staple of qualitative methods, virtual and telephonic interviewshave surfaced and are more widely accepted within social sciences (Hine, 2005). Virtualinterviews can pose some unique problems, however. During one of the virtualinterviews, for example, the Zoom call froze after I had asked a demographic question;when the call had resumed, the participant had begun crying because they had beentriggered by the question. As a dynamic research process, qualitative interviews arereliant upon body language and other nonverbal cues that structure how the researcherasks or does not ask questions (Seitz, 2016). If that interview had occurred in-person, Iwould have been able to see more quickly that the question had disturbed them.Additionally, while my multi-pronged recruitment strategy produced a diversesample in some regard, future research can better this approach. For example, althoughthe pandemic revitalized and created queer virtual social spaces and places, the majorityof the ones I saw were predominantly run by white drag performers located on the Eastand West Coasts. Because a large number of queer people are concentrated on the coasts(Black et al., 2002), I was unable to fully consider and represent the experiences of queerpeople living in other parts of the country. Not only was the majority of my sample dragperformers, but the primary social context in which I recruited was drag events, althoughI did attend a queer virtual play. In this regard, the unique perspectives of my participants,as drag performers of different ages and living in particular locales, reflect theexperiences of people who spend a lot of time in coastal queer social spaces, places, andsome may have a financial investment in those environments.123Next steps in this work are centered around three themes. First, because place,particularly those arising from identities that have been marginalized, is intimatelyconnected to history, this work would benefit from an oral historical perspective; doing sowould provide more context or insight into the very construction and urgencies behindplace. Second, although the narratives of the two people I interviewed who lived outsideof the United States heavily mirrored those of American participants, there were a fewsmall cultural differences that would be interesting to explore. In this regard, while queeridentities created a sense of shared experiences, research looking at social space andplace could benefit from a more explicit attention to cultural and geographic differences.Similarly, because the navigations of queer people of color, particularly Black queerpeople, are impacted by additional levels of discrimination and violence, this work couldbe strengthened by further including their experiences. Third, because this work hasdemonstrated the linkage between queer social space, place, substance use, and identityformation, it could be extended to develop explicit theories on queer substance use.Fourth, the landscapes of substance decriminalization, such as Portugal’sdecriminalization of all substance use, impacts how substances are used in both privateand public space or place. As such, future research could explore the overlap of specificcultural, social, and political contexts with decriminalization efforts that can impact howsocial places are formulated and utilized.Generally, my dissertation suggests that social places do not exist in a vacuum.Rather, they can actively produce or inhibit specific behaviors and embodiments such assubstance use and queerness. While queer identities can be formed through differentmechanisms, substance use can be an important tool in that process (Pienaar et al., 2020).124Furthermore, using substances can be a way for some queer people to subvert ortranscend heteronormative expectations for gender and sexuality and embrace queeridentities (Valentine and Skelton, 2003). This work also highlights the importance ofqueer criminological approaches and queering the field more broadly. In emphasizingagency and intentionality, queer criminological approaches reorient the dictation that allsubstance use is inherently problematic, which could, as Valentine and Fraser (2008:410)note, “give rise to new narratives and counter-narratives of drug use that could, in turn,give rise to new knowledge.”\\125REFERENCESAdams, Tony E. 2020. “Organizing Desire: The Queer Bar.” Pp. 225–39 in TheRoutledge International Handbook of Organizational Autoethnography.Routledge.Adler, Sy, and Johanna Brenner. 2005. “Gender and Space: Lesbians and Gay Men inthe City.” The Urban Sociology Reader 200–207.Agar, Michael. 2003. “Toward a Qualitative Epidemiology.” Qualitative HealthResearch 13(7):974–86.Agee, Christopher. 2006. “Gayola: Police Professionalization and the Politics of SanFrancisco’s Gay Bars, 1950-1968.” Journal of the History of Sexuality15(3):462–89. doi: 10.1353/sex.2007.0024.Agnew, Robert. 1992. “Foundation for a General Strain Theory of Crime andDelinquency.” Criminology 30(1):47–88.Ahmed, Alysha-Karima, Peter Weatherburn, David Reid, Ford Hickson, SergioTorres-Rueda, Paul Steinberg, and Adam Bourne. 2016. “Social Norms Relatedto Combining Drugs and Sex (‘Chemsex’) among Gay Men in South London.”International Journal of Drug Policy 38:29–35.Ahmed, Sara. 2006.

    "abstract": "Research has suggested that queer people may be more likely than their cisgender heterosexual counterparts to use substances. Largely, these higher rates are commonly explained through frameworks of victimization or (ab)use that render substance use as a form of coping or inherently problematic. While some queer people do use substances to cope, the social spaces, places, and contexts in which use often occurs are often obscured or ignored. More recently, contemporary queer criminologists have explored queer substance use and have considered how it is intimately linked to social space, place, identity formation, and community building. This dissertation draws from queer criminological approaches to theorize and develop the idea of social spaces and places. In particular, it explores how queer people define and create social spaces and places, how social spaces and places shape identity formation, and how social spaces and places are imbued with substances. To investigate, 49 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with self-identified queer people who have used substances or frequented queer social spaces to examine the intersection of social place, contexts, substance use, and queer identity formation. As such, it is argued that social spaces and places can be distinguished, imbued with identities, messy, and crucial sites for substance use and identity formations through use",
