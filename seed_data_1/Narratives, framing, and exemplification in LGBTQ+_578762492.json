 Suicide in LGBTQ+ individuals, especially youth, is a growing public health issue. However, the literature on this issue within the field of mass communication is under-developed. This study seeks to understand how the use of framing and exemplification in works of journalism and suicide prevention campaigns are perceived by LGBTQ+ youth aged 18-24. By utilizing a combination of focus groups and in-depth interviews, the study sought to explore what human stories and campaigns were most resonant with the participants and why. The findings indicate that exemplification and framing can play a major role in how LGBTQ+ individuals perceive messages on suicide and suicide prevention. The study offers implications for journalists and communicators who are creating stories or campaigns about the topic.       1  Chapter\tOne:\tThe\tissue\tof\tsuicide\tin\tLGBTQ+\tyouth\tI was once told by a very wise friend of mine: If you do not tell your own story, someone will tell it for you. When a story is told, it continues living within the minds of those who heard it for years to come. These stories can help shape individual experiences and how the public sees issues that are complex and larger than one person. However, sometimes those narratives and stories further contribute to harmful stereotypes and stigma that lead to the othering of individuals and upholding the norms of hegemonic power.  For some people, the internalization of these stories and narratives and their negative connotations leads them to believe their lives are not worth living and that they hold less value than others and are less than human. There is no place for them in society. This leads them to take their own life, leaving behind bereaved friends and family, along with the question of ‘how could we have stopped this?’.  Suicide stands out as one of the most complex public health challenges facing the United States and the world (Knox et al., 2004). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined suicide as: \"self-inflicted injury with the intent to die” (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). The CDC (2021) also identified suicide as the second leading cause of death for people ages 10-14 and 25-34 and the third leading cause of death for those 15-24.  While it is unclear the exact number of suicides that happen, estimates show that there is a death by suicide every eleven minutes, and the overall rate of suicide in the United States has increased by 33% between 1999 and 2019 (Stone, 2021). On top of the   2 human cost that suicide incurs, there is also a sizable monetary cost that suicide creates that further adds to the devastation that it leaves. Suicide is associated with $70 billion in costs due to lifetime work-loss costs (CDC, 2021).  The stigma surrounding suicide and mental illnesses poses a barrier to care for struggling individuals. Whether that stigma originates from society putting pressure on individuals or individuals internalizing their stigma surrounding mental health and suicide, it makes the topic taboo and reinforces silence. As put in Lippert’s (2020) book– An array of serious issues can often discourage members of at-risk and minority populations from sharing information with others about their mental health challenges and deter them from actively seeking out professional treatment for their mental health concerns.  Among those in at-risk populations, members of the LGBTQ+ community (specifically younger members) are at risk of suicide (Herman & Brown, 2019; Johns, 2020). This can be fueled by various factors such as unsupportive families, harassment, violence, and living in what can be considered a heteronormative world (Yep, 2003). These individuals also face barriers to access and disparities when being treated in healthcare (Hafeez et al., 2017).  The demonstrable need for intervention in suicidality in LGBTQ+ youth is evident throughout the literature, and many studies have focused on the relationship between risk factors for suicide and an individual’s gender or sexual identity. However, these studies have largely focused on the quantifiable relationships of these factors rather than attempting to explain how they manifest themselves within the human being and how that human being experiences and communicates around them. While quantitative   3 and epidemiological data are useful, they cannot explain the nuances and perplexities that arise from an individual’s lived experiences. One avenue of exploration in research is examining how narratives impact suicidality in LGBTQ+ youth. Narratives and storytelling have long been a means for humans to understand the world and other humans around them. Littlejohn & Foss (2009) describe narratology as the study of narratives, what they are, how they are structured, and why we use them as a vehicle for communication. As narratives form through memories and experiences, a sense of identity and reality about an individual is born. These narratives impact how people see and interpret the world around them. For those dealing with mental illnesses or suicidal thoughts, these narratives can contribute to the stigma they face from those around them. Parts of those narratives and stigma coming from external society can also influence an individual’s view of themselves and their own internalized stigma. Narratives can also offer a counterbalance and help reduce stigma as well. The outcome depends in part on how the narrative is told and framed. Narratives of mental health struggles and experiences of suicidal ideation (as defined by Harmer et al., 2021) and suicide attempts are one tactic used in suicide prevention campaigns.  While there has been research surrounding the use of narrative within the larger literature of suicide prevention, there is a lack of literature surrounding LGBTQ+ individuals and narratives surrounding their experiences. There is also a lack of what narratives are perpetuated or disseminated via mass communication. While the narrative has shown itself to be a persuasive tool when exploring suicide prevention, this lack of focus on queer realities means that how these messages are crafted and presented may not align with the lived experiences of the people within this   4 population. On top of that, the literature dwells predominantly on psychology and sociology, with a demonstrated lack of communication theory as a basis for media studies and the impact of mass communication on suicide and mental health generally (Lippert et al., 2020).  This means that a subsection of academia has barely begun scratching the surface of the intricacies of this issue. Mass communication itself is an important factor in how humans learn and understand each other. Thus, it also serves as a vehicle for the understanding of mental health and suicide. This, in turn, means that mass communication can serve as a vehicle for both helpful information and stigmatizing stereotypes to circulate and reach large numbers of people. Considering this reach and the impact mass communication has on the public, this area of study is worthy of further exploration. The study uses focus groups and in-depth interviews to explore the realities of LGBTQ+ youth as they consider messaging about suicide prevention campaigns. By uncovering themes and exemplars that resonate with LGBTQ+ youth, this research offers important theoretical implications. It also offers an opportunity to evaluate how LGBTQ+ individuals view the framing in journalistic stories and suicide prevention campaigns and how they impact the stigma surrounding mental health and suicide. On a practical level, these themes and exemplars could create compelling messages to provide protective effects for the audience. Suicide prevention in and of itself is already a worthwhile cause. The study could also provide theoretical importance on how studies on suicide contagion, the Werther effect, and the Papageno effect can be explored while keeping queer realities in mind. It will also offer the opportunity to evaluate the perceived impact of using   5 exemplars and frames within LGBTQ+ individuals. This study begins with a literature review chapter is to review the theoretical framework of framing theory and exemplification theory regarding health communication and suicide. I will also explore the frameworks for understanding stigma and its effects on communicating mental health messages will also be explored. The chapter will close by analyzing the Werther effect and the Papageno effect within mass communication research before moving into a detailed section on research methods and means of analysis applied to the data collected. Chapter two will serve as a literature review to examine the chilling effect that stigma can create around conversations about suicide and mental health. It will also examine the journalist and mass communicators’ role in creating messages and narratives about suicide. The chapter will close with an examination of the Papageno effect, the Werther effect, and suicide contagion. The research questions established in the literature review will then set the stage for the next chapter. Chapter three will cover the methodology employed by the study and why these qualitative methods were chosen. This will include an explanation of why these methods best serve the goal of answering my research questions. This chapter will also detail my process for conducting the study as well as my procedures for analyzing the information gathered.  Chapter four will review the specific findings of the study and answer the proposed research questions. Providing insights into how the participants perceived the use of exemplification and framing in suicide prevention messaging and journalistic stories. This will provide interesting insights into how LGBTQ+ youth perceive the use   6 of exemplification in messaging around suicide and suicide prevention. Chapter five will expand upon the findings from chapter four, offering theoretical implications that future scholars might be able to explore as well as a practical examination of how framing and exemplification can be used as a tool for suicide prevention.     7 Chapter\tTwo:\tLiterature\tReview\tThe\timpact\tof\tStigma\ton\tsuicide\tand\tmental\thealth\tSmith (2007) uses the following quote to describe how stigma manifests itself within communication messages, spread, and how these messages elicit emotion from the audience: Stigma messages bear four attributes. They provide content cues (a) to distinguish people and (b) to categorize these distinguished people as separate social entity. In addition, stigma messages include content cues (c) to link this distinguished group to physical and social peril, and (d) to imply a responsibility or blame on the part of the stigmatized for their membership in the stigmatized group and their linked peril. These content cues encourage the activation of stereotypes, and induce affective reactions (disgust, anger, and fear) and associated action tendencies, which all foster the formation of stigma attitudes. If people hear such messages, then they may share them with others in their groups because stigma messages provide for in-group solidarity and differentiation from others.  When exploring the concept of stigma, it is necessary to delineate between public stigma (also referred to as external stigma) and internalized stigma. Public stigma is the “othering” of a group or individuals by a larger and more powerful social group (Corrigan et al., 2005). Internalized stigma refers to adopting and internalizing stigmas within oneself.  A study found that de-framing reduced public stigma while reframing messages lowered perceived stigma against mentally ill individuals (Vyncke & van   8 Gorp, 2018). However, these approaches could not lower perceived stigma, public stigma, or internalized stigma among those with a family history of mental illness (Vyncke & van Gorp, 2018). One aspect of stigmatization that has been found to directly influence an individual’s experience with mental health or suicidality is social distance (Horton & Richard Wohl, 1956; Link et al., 1999). Social distance refers to someone being pushed out of a larger social group due to some perception about their worth or status as a human being, leading these individuals to be ostracized or avoided in social interactions and relationships (Jorm, 2000; Jorm et al., 2009).  Survivors of suicide and those left behind after a person’s death by suicide often experience stigma associated with bereavement and the societal belief that suicidal behavior makes a person weak, or affixes blame on them (Cvinar, 2005). This creates an entirely new kind of stress on both types of survivors that often need clinical intervention to be fully addressed. This bereavement prevents an important aspect of recovery for those dealing with mental illnesses and suicidal ideation, keeping these individuals from healthy parasocial relationships that can lead to support. As defined by Dibble and colleagues (2016), parasocial interactions refer to mutual awareness that can only be accessed during media viewing or exposure. Whereas a parasocial relationship is a longer-term association and may begin with a viewing of media and stretches outside the confines of a media exposure situation.  Narrative messages are promising in shifting perceptions of responsibility regarding health issues. It was found that the stigma around health messaging for some   9 individuals decreased when the message focused on not pinning responsibility for a condition on the person with that condition (Heley et al., 2020). One study showed that positive or quality parasocial interactions with transgender individuals ended up providing a reduction in prejudice towards transgender individuals. In contrast, poor parasocial interactions could lead to unintended effects on the prejudice surrounding these individuals being depicted (Massey et al., 2021). The interpersonal theory of suicide complements this research (Van Orden et al., 2010) which uses perceived burdensomeness to the people around the suicidal individual and thwarted belongingness to contribute to a person’s suicidal ideation or risk of acting to end their life. This theoretical framework informs former research on stigma by looking at how internalized and public stigma manifest in the person and might contribute to their issues. The\tRole\tof\tJournalists\tand\tmental\thealth\texperts\t\tIn journalistic stories, expert opinions can give an air of seriousness to suicide. However, these opinions are also associated with a sensationalist and unfavorable context. Only 14% of news stories involving the treatment of suicide showed successful interventions (McGinty et al., 2016). This creates a perception within the audience that treatments and interventions for mental health issues and suicidal ideation are not productive. This contributes to stigma and how people perceive getting help for suicidal ideation or behavior. This is problematic, as news media organizations and their journalists cover mental illnesses largely fail to give even the most basic details to understand these disorders (McGinty et al., 2014). This prevents the audience from fully understanding   10 the complex medical conditions associated with mental health disorders. McLemore (2019) also found common exemplars of mentally ill individuals as dangerous, unhinged, and violent. Suppose the experts who understand the epidemiology and medical factors contributing to suicide are viewed as untrustworthy or negative. That leaves a rift between professionals in the mental health field and the journalists and media outlets reporting on those issues (Schulze, 2007).  This, in turn, leaves the inadequate framings of suicide and mental illness unchallenged (Owen et al., 2012). The World Health Organization (2001) reported that mental illness is underrepresented in the media compared to its prevalence in the real world. As suicide is more prevalent in individuals with mental illnesses and mental health problems (Bolton et al., 2015), this underrepresentation also affects the depictions of suicide that we do and do not see in the landscape of journalism or prevention campaigns.  This aligns with Beam and colleagues’ (2017) study that interviewed journalists about the policies and procedures surrounding the coverage of suicide in a newsroom. It found that there were formal and unspoken policies covering suicide, possibly due to its “unnatural” state of death. Journalists use their news judgment to determine why these stories are worth covering. (Yaqub et al., 2020) This can include questioning whether suicide has a high public impact and is newsworthy or “interesting” enough to cover.  The study identified four conventional rationales for why journalists might choose to cover suicide: 1. Intrusion into the public arena, 2. Impact on a community, 3. The suicide was an odd or unusual occurrence, 4. Attention to a social cause or   11 problem. Two unconventional rationales were also established: the reporting of stories profoundly affecting loss survivors and pressure via social media to cover the topic.  Regarding journalistic coverage of LGBTQ+ youth suicide, one study found four predominant frames created: 1.) Suicide statistics reporting, focusing on queer vulnerability, 2.) Deviancy and guilt, driven by difference and shame, 3.) The suicide survivor and the role of heterosexism, 4.) Individualizing the causes: bullying (Cover, 2012). To summarize: Journalistic coverage of mental illnesses and suicide can often serve to further stigmatize those dealing with suicidal ideation or behavior. Journalists view suicide as “an unnatural death” and have a rationale that informs how they report or do not report on the topic. Not reporting on suicide and mental illness means that stigmatic frames were left unchallenged and remained dominant. Journalistic stories were also largely found to not accurately deliver the most basic mental disorder information. When presenting mental health experts in stories, journalists did not showcase successful suicide interventions.  Suicide\tprevention\tmass\tmedia\tcampaigns\tMass media campaigns can produce positive health-related behavioral changes in their audience (Wakefield et al., 2010). Suicide prevention and suicide awareness campaigns make up the bulk of the strategic communication efforts employed by public health organizations to deal with suicide. Messaging in these campaigns is important to ensure the campaign is impactful (Nicholas et al., 2018).  One study on the usage of campaigns in the United States found that a campaign geared towards an Ohio community led to an increase in calls to an   12 emergency line for those suffering from suicidal ideation. (Oliver et al., 2008). However, in a systematic review article examining the effectiveness of mass media campaigns for suicide prevention Torok and colleagues (2017) concluded that while campaigns could lead to higher literacy on suicide, they were not necessarily associated with behavior change. An examination of suicide prevention public service announcements around the world found that 1/3 of those depicted were people at risk for suicide, the general population, or family members (Ftanou et al., 2017)  The Trevor Project is one of the leading organizations researching and working in suicide prevention for LGBTQ+ youth. They run crisis lines through text, calls, or an online chat for LGBTQ+ youth experiencing suicidal ideation or a mental health emergency. The Trevor Project also advertises these crisis services and partners with celebrities in social media and corporate campaigns for suicide prevention (The Trevor Project, 2021).  One of the most prominent campaigns for suicide awareness and prevention within the LGBTQ+ community is the “It Gets Better” campaign. The campaign was launched by Dan Savage and his partner Terry on YouTube in 2010 in response to a rise in the number of suicides among young gay men (Asakura & Craig, 2014).  They shared their own experiences growing up as gay men growing up to show viewers that life can get better and that they did not need to end their lives. After the initial video was posted, user-generated content following the same format and the “it gets better” slogan began being posted across the internet. When LGBTQ+ youth were interviewed about the campaign, they enjoyed the feeling it gave them of not being alone. However,   13 one critique they had was the lack of explicitness of suicide being the topic of these videos (Kirchner et al., 2020). In the next section,  Framing\tand\tExemplification\tTheory\tThe term narrative has become an umbrella term that encompasses various mediums. Three aspects determine what can be coded as narrative: (a) there must be a sequence of events, (b) causal development between these events, and (c) memorable phrasing to represent those events (Littlejohn & Foss, 2009). Frank et al. (2015) found that identification with specific characters was important regarding the perceived susceptibility and severity of the portrayed health issue. In addition to that, more complex characters may help in the use of the narrative intervention. When the protagonist of a narrative shares’ similar characteristics with that of the audience, the messages presented in the narrative are more persuasive to the audience Chen et al. (2016) and Calati (2018) acknowledges that objective and subjective instances of isolation and loneliness in the audience should be considered when looking at factors related to a heightened risk of suicide.  Communication frames can, in this case, be seen as essential to messaging for suicide prevention campaigns and news stories. An important aspect to consider when creating or evaluating a message covering the topic. The use of perspective can be integral to the audience’s perception of how persuasive a narrative regarding health messaging is. Bantjes (2019) contends that while biomedical narratives of suicide have dominated suicide literature, the use of this perspective should be taken with caution. First-person perspectives cannot be solely relied upon as they can neither entirely refute nor support biomedical perspectives due to their subjective nature. This makes   14 creating one single message around the biological factors influencing suicide risk incredibly hard. When covering complex topics such as suicide, researchers can look at how messages are framed to convey information. Framing Theory (Chong & Druckman, 2007) is composed of the premise that issues can be viewed differently based on which parts of a message are prioritized. Framing is how people develop conceptualizations over problems or change their thoughts. In journalistic stories, this refers to how the story conceptualizes a problem and draws attention to the causes and solutions for said problem. Entman (1993) described framing as a process defined by journalistic selection and salience. Framing a topic is to select and bring forth aspects of a perceived reality and make them more prominent in communicating text, highlighting a particular part of the issue, and making it forefront for the audience. Druckman (2001) offers seven different definitions of framing that inevitably fall into two categories: frames in communication and frames in thought. While framing embodies how a message conveys the complexity of a topic, Exemplification is used to showcase an example of the topic. Zillmann (1999) defines exemplification as recognizing shared features between an example (also known as an exemplar), who is a person sharing their story, and that of the exemplified. Exemplification is a heuristic that allows people to understand complex issues quickly by drawing on prior interactions or experiences with those issues (Zillmann, 2006). In other words, some aspect allows the exemplar to be grouped. To be considered an exemplar, only one aspect needs to be exemplified or most salient, as that is what leads it to be able to be grouped with others of its kind.   15  Exemplars are used to humanize topics and illustrate abstract issues more comprehensively, as demonstrated in Hinnant and colleagues' (2013) study regarding the usage of exemplars in journalistic stories. Exemplars can also be seen as an “illustrative individual case” (Brosius and Bathelt, 1994) that describe or demonstrate the experience of someone living with a situation, offering enough detail that the audience can imagine that situation (Greene, Campo, and Banerjee 2010). Regarding exemplars in health messaging, Zillmann (2006) suggests exemplars should be used when necessary to reflect the quantitative distribution of risk in each situation. Suicide\tand\tmedia\teffects\tThe\tWerther\tEffect\tOne of the first cases of mass media's power in portraying suicide came from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s 1774 novel The Sorrows of Young Werther. In the novel, the young protagonist Werther commits suicide at the end of the book. This, in turn, caused a wave of \"copycat\" suicides across Europe via the same method. Phillips (1974) found that models of suicide were more likely to be repeated or emulated if the subject was prestigious and shared circumstances with the imitator. This phenomenon has come to be known as the Werther effect. Recently, society has seen the Werther effect played out through the fictional series 13 Reasons Why (e.g., Arendt & Romer, 2020; Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2019; Zimerman et al., 2018). The series is based on a novel of the same name written by author Jay Asher. In both mediums, the story revolves around the suicide of teenager Hannah Baker. In both the book and the television show, Baker’s suicide is depicted   16 vividly, and she leaves a list of thirteen reasons why she chose to commit suicide, each correlating to a person that had wronged her in some aspect.  Niederkrotenthaler and colleagues (2019) found a 15% excess in suicides after the show's initial release among teens in the same age group as the character Hannah. While it has been demonstrated that fictional depictions of suicide can cause replication of the act in populations, the larger risk lies within non-fiction depictions of suicide (Gould, 2001; 2003). While not all stories covering suicide necessarily resulted in an imitation effect, there is evidence that stories covering celebrity suicides were almost five times more likely to contribute to an imitation effect (Stack, 2005). Inconsistencies between studies and what variables they are operationalizing and measuring regarding this effect have led to different interpretations of how media depictions might influence suicidal behavior in populations (Stack, 2005).  This idea of the imitation of suicide being a contaminant to society that causes imitation when depicted is explored through the concept of suicide contagion. While there are several definitions of suicide contagion, some illustrations only add redundancy to the study of media effects. Cheng and colleagues (2014) argue that contagion as imitation offers the most value when evaluating how suicidal behaviors spread amongst the populace. This is because this perspective combines public health, sociology, and psychology perspectives to offer a broader view of the individual and population levels.  Reporting on suicide has also been found to have adverse effects that can drive audiences to suicidal ideation or suicide attempts. O’Carroll & Potter (1994) found that reporting on suicide could lead to risks for the public. Suicide contagion can be   17 fueled through simplistic explanations for suicide that ignore the many interlinked facets that might contribute to the behavior and engaging in repetitive or excessive coverage of suicide.  This idea of contagion as imitation fits with the principles of the Werther effect due to its emphasis on imitation being a driving factor in suicidal behavior (Cheng et al., 2014). This concept, however, does not account for other influences outside of media depictions that can be imitated. This leaves out factors that could be impactful and informative regarding what brings about instances of suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior in an individual (Mueller, 2017). Drawing solely from one portrayal of suicide does not consider factors such as family medical history, socio-economic status, or race, which all might play a role or contribute to some risk. However, there has been little emphasis on researching how presenting these depictions impacts and resonates with the population or people being depicted. The\tPapageno\tEffect\tWhere the Werther effect contends that portrayals of suicide can trigger copycat behaviors in the populace, the newer Papageno effect offers a different perspective on mass media's power in the societal conversation surrounding suicide and suicide prevention. Like the Werther effect, the Papageno effect can be traced back to a fictional medium, in this case, the opera The Magic Flute, which was composed by Wolfgang Mozart. In the opera, the main character expresses the feeling of suicidal ideation but ends up not acting on these urges. Niederkrotenthaler et al. (2010) found that if suicide-related media focused on suicidal ideation without a   18 suicide attempt or completion of suicide, the message could have a protective impact on the audience.  The study also found that sensationalist media reports or myths regarding suicide were associated with increased suicide rates. In some of the most recent research regarding the framing of suicide, Niederkrotenthaler & Till (2020) found that suicide prevention messages with a straightforward narrative of recovery were safe to use with individuals who had recent suicide attempts, and these messages may have the potential to reduce short-term suicide risk.  The study also found that news stories with themes of hope and recovery can change the societal conversation on suicide. This coincides with studies (Foster, 2003; Greene & Britton, 2013; Ma, 2017; Pirkis et al., 2001;2006) that show that campaigns/messages that focus on mental health recovery and not shame can promote positive outcomes (Klimes-Dougan et al., 2009; Llewellyn-Beardsley et al., 2019; Rennick-Egglestone et al., 2019; Slade et al., 2019). This issue's literature and theoretical framework pose questions that would be best researched through a qualitative study (Hjelmeland & Knizek, 2010). The literature surrounding suicide currently focuses largely on epidemiological, neuro(biological), and intervention studies (Lippert et al., 2020).  The focus on relationships between risk factors and suicidal behavior has not answered larger questions that explain how these risk factors are related to suicide (Hjelmeland & Knizek, 2010) and how they interact within the person who exemplifies the quantitative data points. While many try to separate the variables of identity, mental health, and suicidal behavior from one another, ignoring that all these   19 factors intersect with the individual experiencing them. Researchers cannot consider the “parts” individually without considering the human experience that creates those “parts.” Research\tQuestions\t Overall, the studies evaluated within the literature review have provided an evaluation of why some groups are at a higher risk of suicidal ideation or behavior but have been unable to garner a deeper understanding of how these factors interplay and might cause a person to consider taking their life. They have also not made room or attempted to study what queer realities might look like compared to cis-gendered or heterosexual experiences. There also have not been any major studies into how depictions of exemplars in suicide prevention campaigns might influence an individual’s desire to get help or how they can be used to influence behavior or attitudes towards those exhibiting suicidal behavior or thoughts. Given these findings within the literature review, this leads me to pose the following research questions: RQ1: What exemplars of suicide prevention are most resonant for LGBTQ+ individuals?  RQ2: How do LGBTQ+ individuals perceive the impact of frames and exemplars on suicide prevention and larger mental health discussions? RQ3: What pre-established narratives around LGBTQ+ suicides do people recall? RQ4: How do LGBTQ+ individuals view the impact of exemplars on stigma surrounding suicide and mental health?   20 Chapter\tThree:\tMethod\tTwo qualitative methods were utilized to study this topic: focus groups and in-depth semi-structured interviews. Qualitative methods offered more rich insight and data by the end of the study (Christians & Carey, 1989). Since there is little literature on exemplification and framing in suicide prevention for LGBTQ+ people, this study sought to create a strong theoretical foundation others can build from. Considering that the bulk of studies revolving around research in suicide and suicide prevention are based on quantitative epidemiological data, there is a focus on relationships between variables and trends in suicide rates that may not reflect the nuances of queer lived experiences. In the literature, there was no clear focus on how these factors interact within the lives of those experiencing suicidal ideation, meaning there is little theoretical grounding to help explain the phenomena. To improve the literature and the practical implications of suicide prevention, the study focused on building theory so that further studies might benefit from not simply following trends in epidemiological data. Both focus groups and semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted from February 20, 2023, to April 10th. As defined by Goodman (1961), Snowball sampling was utilized for study recruitment. Snowball sampling provided the benefit of rich data since the sampling is coming from people who identified others that would make information-rich interview participants. All individuals participating in the study were members of the LGBTQ+ community ages 18-24.    21  This age range was the focus, as it is the age group within the LGBTQ+ community that is most likely to act upon suicidal behavior (Herman & Brown, 2019; Johns, 2020). The researcher contacted local LGBTQ+-friendly businesses within Columbia, Missouri, and surrounding towns and LGBTQ+ organizations on the University of Missouri’s campus providing them with material to first promote the focus groups and then (refer to Appendix E). For organizations on campus and businesses, I asked if they could distribute my flyer in their physical location, or I provided them a script to send out via email within their organizations. In this case, the focus of snowball sampling was to encourage individuals with relevant experiences to draw upon their networks for others who might have similar experiences and a willingness to speak on the topic. A screener survey was created to filter participants so the most information-rich participants would be interviewed.  General demographic data on age, gender identity, and sexuality were taken from the screener survey. To ensure that participants had relevant experience with either a suicide prevention campaign or journalistic story, participants were asked, “Have you, in the past two years, viewed a journalistic story covering suicide in the LGBTQ+ community or a suicide prevention campaign targeting LGBTQ+ individuals?” Participants who answered no to this question were directed to the end of the survey and did not participate. Individuals who listed their age as older than 24 were also directed to the end of the survey and did not participate. Focus\tGroups\tUsing this sampling strategy, participants with queer identities were recruited for participation in two focus groups, with two people in each focus group (Masadeh,   22 2012). The originally intended number of participants in these focus groups were intended to be higher. Still, the number of participants who signed up for the study and attended was much lower than anticipated. Contacts established in the focus groups then helped locate individuals that would best fit follow-up semi-structured in-depth interviews.  Focus groups were conducted for 90 minutes (Masadeh, 2012), with the audio and video from the session recorded and later transcribed. Focus group participants were offered refreshments during the duration of the focus group. All focus group and in-depth interview participants were compensated for their time with a $10 donation to their choice of either The Trevor Project or Trans Lifeline. Participants were emailed a receipt displaying the donation to their organization of choice after all study participants had been interviewed (see Appendix I).  Focus group participants were presented with a 30-second advertisement used in suicide prevention campaigns by The Trevor Project, a news story by the independent nonprofit newsroom. The 19th covered the stories of LGBTQ+ youth who had suicidal ideation and shared their story was shown to participants. This was chosen based on the following criteria: The story must have been digitally published between January 2020 and December 2022. Stories covered either a suicide or suicide attempt of an LGBTQ+ youth (age 18-24). Presenting these stories and awareness campaigns in a focus group format allowed social contexts within the community to become tangible throughout the conversation.    23 Focus groups were held in person at an agreed-upon location in Columbia, Missouri, and in-depth interviews were held via Zoom when the participants chose between those dates. Focus groups were held for a total of 90 minutes, with participants being asked to review both stimuli and provide feedback based on the discussion guide (see Appendix F). Discussions guides allow for structure within the interview without eliminating the ability to pivot when something unexpected arises (Lindlof & Taylor, 2011). Participants were then asked questions about how they interpreted the usage of personal stories or individual depictions in each stimulus. Participants and the interviewer were recorded via Zoom to capture the conversation for further use.  Semi-structured\tin-depth\tinterviews\tSemi-structured in-depth interviews offered flexibility in receiving data from the participants, and it allowed for answers that potentially were not expected or anticipated that proved to be insightful (Roulston, 2010). Questions concerned how they viewed journalistic stories or suicide prevention campaigns covering LGBTQ+ suicide or suicidal ideations. Questions also probed how individuals viewed the usage of exemplars and personal stories of LGBTQ+ suicide or suicide prevention and in what ways these exemplars resonated with the individual.  My operationalized definition of resonance comes from Wan (2008, pg. 472–489), defined here as “the achievement of a harmonious state of mind in an individual due to accordance between an external stimulus and relevant nodes stored in the long-term memory. Here, the external stimulus refers to the messages.”     24 A similar study (Hinnant et al., 2013) served as the basis to work from for my methodology. Particularly, the qualitative study was done with in-depth interviews. Using grand tour questions (McCracken, 1988) was emulated, with participants able to provide insightful data from their point of view on their experiences with narrative and suicide prevention. Considering how often LGBTQ+ individuals feel excluded or “othered,” they must learn how they perceived and navigated these experiences and feelings to build a theory to explain these factors. Learning more about their perceptions of the impact of internalized stigma and public stigma around suicide led to being able to operationalize some of the core themes and concepts that arose in conversations with the participants. These can then be used to further study this population and suicide prevention more generally. Procedure\tIn-depth interviews were held virtually on Zoom at a mutually agreed-upon time between the interviewer and researcher. Interviews lasted between 45 minutes to 75 minutes. Participants were asked a series of pre-made questions (see Appendix H). Interviews lasted between 40 to 75 minutes with the average time being around 45 minutes. Still, there was flexibility in the order that these questions were asked and probing, or new questions based on participant responses to engage with new ideas and phenomena introduced. All participants' identities have been anonymized, with only a number associated with them and gender identity, sexual orientation, and age. The combined table for both focus groups and IDIs is shown in the figure below: Figure\t1-\tParticipant\tInformation\t  25 Assigned Participant # Age Gender Identity Sexual Orientation  Participant 1 23 Cisgender Man Homosexual Participant 2 22 Cisgender Woman Homosexual/Lesbian Participant 3 22 Cisgender Woman Bisexual Participant 4 23 Cisgender Woman Pansexual Participant 5 22 Cisgender Woman Queer Participant 6 24 Cisgender Woman Bisexual Participant 7 19 Genderqueer Bisexual Participant 8 23 Cisgender Man Bisexual Participant 9 21 Cisgender Woman Homosexual Participant 10 19 Cisgender Woman Homosexual Participant 11 21 Non-binary Bisexual Participant 12 22 Non-binary Queer  Data\tAnalysis\tData were analyzed using grounded theory (Corbin and Strauss, 1990) to evaluate my research findings. Grounded theory, in this case, helped build greater concepts and themes that can be used in the future for new research.  The coding process followed the general steps associated with grounded theory, with the assistance of Atlas.ti to organize and visualize coding. The constant comparative method (Glaser, 1965) was utilized to ensure data saturation. Due to the small number of focus group participants, I decided to include the data from those sessions along with the rest of the in-depth interviews. Below, I have attached an example of what my open-coding process looked like, though the codes were changed and merged throughout the study and data evaluation.   26  Figure\t2-\tOpen\tCoding\tSample\tQ: Do you think that there's a difference in the way that journalists cover suicide and suicide prevention within cis[gender] and straight communities versus the LGBTQ community?   A: I think that their queerness is a lot more of a part of the reason for, like, why these people are hurting themselves, why these people are being put in these situations, a lot of it is put to, not to say that it's their fault, but I'm saying that it's brought to attention, you know? When somebody kills themselves or commits suicide, rather, if a cis/hetero folk person does that, you know? They'll read the story, and they'll say, ‘So and so died because of this.’ But if a queer folk, does it, it then becomes this trans person kill themselves this, you know, gay genderqueer person killed themself and they start to sort of like start to debate on queerness when that's not like even the topic at hand sometimes.         Identity as part of Suicide stigma    Queerness at fault   Cis gendered covered without the fact they’re cis or straight being part of it.    Queerness as the focus  Queer suicide  Debating queer identity   After the open coding was done, I moved into the process of focused coding. Using Atlas.ti, a qualitative coding software, I began the process of focused coding. Focused coding allows the researcher to be able to apply previously made codes to a larger context (Charmaz, 1996). These codes were color-coded within the software to indicate relationships between codes, as many were divided by concepts and themes. An example of this focus coding is shown below: Figure\t3-\tFocused\tCoding\tSample\t  27   This coding process also happened during a larger process of constant comparison (Boeije, 2002) between texts, as new data was added. This process allowed for a constant comparison in what was being said between participants, allowing new codes to arise from the data and for more salient concepts and themes to be recognized. The methodology also offered reflexivity in returning to previous transcripts and conversations so that codes could be updated and merged as necessary. This aided in identifying divergent opinions, themes, and the interactions between Q: Do you think that there's a difference in the way that journalists cover suicide and suicide prevention within cis[gender] and straight communities versus the LGBTQ community?   A: I think that their queerness is a lot more of a part of the reason for, like, why these people are hurting themselves, why these people are being put in these situations, a lot of it is put to, not to say that it's their fault, but I'm saying that it's brought to attention, you know, when somebody kills themself, or commit suicide, rather, if a cis/hetero folk person does that, you know, they'll read the story and they'll say, So and so died because of this.

To achieve constant comparison, the research followed these analysis steps: 1. Participants were recorded while they were interviewed, and notes were taken during that time. 2. Interviews transcripts were edited from their original raw form for clarity using the recorded video and audio, allowing for immersion in the data and a sense of what was most meaningful (Chun Tie et al., 2019). 3. Upon completing the edits to ensure clarity of the transcriptions, they were uploaded into Atlas.ti, where excerpts were chosen from each interview and focus group to include in open coding (Corbin and Strauss, 1990), going line by line through the texts, and creating codes from the data. 4. Transcripts and data were put through the open before-mentioned coding process to begin analysis. 5. The process was repeated with the next interview transcript and then compared against the previous interview.  The process was conducted for focus groups and IDI participants. This process took approximately seven weeks, starting from the first focus group and ending with the last in-depth interview. Overall, there were 204 pages of double-spaced interview data, and 410 excerpts that were examined, transcribed, and compared between focus groups and in-depth interviews.  Data deemed irrelevant to the research questions was excluded from further analysis. The data reduction process resulted in the final count of excerpts to be 329, though not all will be directly mentioned or drawn from in the findings section. Qualitative study often leads to more data than can be contained within its findings and some data likely proves to be more relevant to answering the researchers’   29 questions than others. Data reduction (Crowley & Delfico, 1996) meant reviewing quotes and codes throughout the process and systematically choosing to remove them.  In the end, five categories were created to organize the findings with thirteen coded themes (see Appendix K) and twenty-seven concepts (see Appendix L). These appendices contain an operationalized definition for each coded concept theme and category created during the study, these serve to add transparency to my process and serve as a guide for future researchers to use in their studies by offering workable concepts and themes to include in experimental design or quantitative study. With all, throughout the process of data analysis it became clear that what I had was not fully covered by my research question, this leads into my next section on the amended research questions answered in my findings. Research\tQuestions\tReflection\tAs a researcher my philosophy largely falls into pragmatism (Morgan, 2014). Most of my research questions and curiosity regarding how the world works stem from my desire to find solutions for problems that I see. Coming into this study, the research questions I had initially used to guide the conversations were very broad due to there not being much literature about the specific topic in the field of mass communications. The data I analyzed from interviewing my participants was very rich, and it became clear that other aspects complemented my questions and provided additional relevant and pragmatic findings that I had originally not accounted for.  While this was my intention, because I felt going from the broadest level of understanding and working down to the specifics would yield the most insight, it soon became clear that information and answers came from the participants I had not   30 originally accounted for. The information was unaccounted for but gave further insight into the problem and helped fully develop my theory behind parts of this phenomena. I also chose a slightly constructivist viewpoint (Zhou, 2014) in taking the data given to me and applying it to a larger context.  According to Zhou’s (2014) research primer, constructivist thinking offers rich contextual information so the interpretation can be considered completer and more accurate. In the case of this research, the context associated with where and how individuals encounter narratives or exemplars of suicide prevention within the LGBTQ+ community largely depends on individual instances and the audience’s interpretation. This was useful because I could keep pragmatism in mind while using a more constructivist version of grounded theory (Mills et al., 2006; Charmaz, 2017). To account for these changes in my approach and evaluation of the data I obtained, I have amended my research questions by adding additional sub-questions into the research to account for what I found. RQ1: What exemplars of suicide prevention are most resonant for LGBTQ+ individuals?  RQ2: How do LGBTQ+ individuals perceive the impact of frames and exemplars on suicide prevention and larger mental health discussions? RQ2A: How do LGBTQ+ individuals perceive the journalist's role in framing stories about LGBTQ+ suicide? RQ3: What pre-established narratives around LGBTQ+ suicides do people recall?   31 RQ3A: Are there narratives of suicide within the LGBTQ+ community that individuals recall from social media? RQ4: How do LGBTQ+ individuals view the impact of exemplars on stigma surrounding suicide and mental health? Chapter\tfour:\tFindings\t This study set out to create a grounded theory of how LGBTQ+ individuals interpret the usage of exemplars and framing in journalistic stories covering suicide and suicide prevention campaigns that targeted members of the LGBTQ+ community. To share my findings, I have largely used block quotes taken directly from the edited transcript.  Other than cutting out some repetitive words such as ‘um’, ‘and’, or ‘like’, these quotes are in the participants' words. Since the issue of suicide is so impactful to the members of the LGBTQ+ community, and they are sharing deeply personal feelings and experiences, I felt it important to keep these words in the voice of the participant that uttered them as much as I could. Sometimes, I used brackets to add context from the question asked so the quote can be fully understood in context of the questions being asked. The findings chapter is divided by research questions, going from what subjects are most resonant in exemplars to the perceived impact of exemplars and framing on stigma.  There is overlap between some of these findings, meaning some of the findings for views on exemplars also had implications for stigma. To begin, the first section of findings covers how exemplars on social media were accounted and resonated with audiences. The emphasis on social media comes from participants recounting their own   32 interactions or discovery of exemplars sharing their personal stories, and how most participants were becoming engaged with LGBTQ+ health issues on these platforms versus going to more traditional news sources or public health organizations. RQ1\t&\tRQ3A\tSocial\tMedia\texemplars\tTo answer the first research question, which asked: What exemplars of suicide prevention are most resonant for LGBTQ+ individuals? I turned to participants’ thoughts on how they got their information or news on LGBTQ+ related health topics. This ended up also leading to relevant information that informed my third sub question of what social media narratives of suicide that participants recalled Throughout the study, in talking to each participant it became clear that most were not necessarily always getting their health-related news concerning the LGBTQ+ community from journalists or public health organizations. In fact, no participant directly mentioned the involvement of any public health organization or campaign created by one when asked about where they got their information from.  Largely, participants recalled encountering exemplars and messages concerning mental health and LGBTQ+ health issues on social media platforms, curated from within their established online community. For instance, participant 7 talked about getting their information on Twitter from someone they identified as a citizen journalist who was also a transgender woman. participant 7 noted that the fact that this individual was a community member made it easier for them to trust this person’s coverage and intentions. Participant 10 noted that they still got most of their information from major news networks such as CNN but noted that they did have instances where LGBTQ+ specific social media accounts or organizations also became a source of information for them.   33 Most other participants had a similar relationship with larger news organizations. Some participants see them as a primary source of information and others choose to get their information from other niche organizations on Instagram and Twitter. Participant 12 noted that they actively sought out LGBTQ+ related health news but ended up being introduced to information while not actively searching for it on the social media platform TikTok. They noted that due to an algorithm change where people could see what their contacts were sharing, they saw a large influx in information. They viewed this as both negative and positive, with the feature bringing them more information and increasing the risk of being exposed to misinformation. TikTok also brought an interesting and unexpected finding regarding the effectiveness of exemplification in suicide prevention, which was the role that LGBTQ+ elders played when they shared their stories. One exemplar, unaffiliated with any news organization or suicide prevention campaign, was encountered on the social media platform and was brought up by two different IDI participants. Here’s what Participant 11 had to say about the exemplar:  This is insane to me, I'm so sorry. I just thought about this: The fact that like, there's this TikTok of like this older, trans man, and a lot of people [in the comments] were saying how, like, how happy they were to see a trans man with gray hair. It stuck with me, and I wanted to cry because I was like, I didn't realize like how crazy that really feels and how sad it is. Like this is one of the older people that we know of that’s fully alive.   34 The participant expresses shock and an intense emotional response that almost brought them to tears from seeing someone like them who identified as transgender and lived long enough to be able to physically appear aged.  The emotional response seems to come from a place of seeing an individual who shares part of their identity that has managed live fully as themselves for years, and lived past whatever life expectancies were put on the LGBTQ+ community. Another participant echoes this sentiment and further delves into why it is resonant and engaging. As participant 12 explains: There’s this trans TikTok-er who is in his 50s and someone left a comment saying it was so inspirational to see a trans guy with gray hair. Because in their exact quotes, they said “I didn't know we get to live that long”. That just like really impacted me that you know, our queer elders are so important because people talk a lot about how you it's a new thing, because obviously, there are so many factors that make kids be more likely to be able to come out whether that's like being in a more accepting generation, or frankly, the fact that a lot of those older queer people either never came out and just never accepted themselves. Here, Participant 12 draws directly from the comment section of this video the perception that, LGBTQ+ individuals do not get to live long. While they do not expand on why LGBTQ+ youth tend to die younger, this view is likely influenced by statistics of violent death and suicide within the community which make it seem more likely that an LGBTQ+ youth will die, rather than get to see live fully and authentically. Throughout the course of the study, lived experiences became a salient theme that was connected to resonance within the audience.    35 If a person was able to draw on experiences they lived through and provide perspective on how they lived through it, they were seen as more authentic and helpful. For this exemplar, the physical attribute of grey hair is focused on in the quotations here, a marker of the aging process seen as profound to both participants and those who commented on the exemplar’s content on TikTok.  Participant 12 also commented on how this exemplar seemed to be negating certain societal stigmas: I think it's so important and inspirational to see older queer people because often you're sort of hit with this messaging that this is just confused kids. That this is just like something weird that we're doing. So, seeing older queer people, just sort of helps to remind us and remind the people who are against us, the fact that we are a strong community and we have been around as long as humans have been around. Because as long as you have humans, you're gonna have queer humans. So yeah, I think it's really effective to hear from queer elders. Because again, it reminds you of having a future and getting to live that long but it also reminds you that this isn't just happening now. It happened back then as well and that people have overcome it and you'll be able to overcome it too. The participant sees this exemplar also negates the stigma associated with the LGBTQ+ community that their identity is a new social phenomenon or a “fad” as they put it in another part of their interview. Seeing an individual who has visibly aged sharing their experiences conflicts with common societal stigma and narratives that LGBTQ+ identities are something new.  It showcases that individuals from different generations and backgrounds share this identity and some of the struggles associated with seeing themselves as being able to   36 grow up as their authentic self without repercussions that take their life in some way. Seeing a person who had physically aged and lives openly as LGBTQ+ puts forth the narrative that people can live authentically and grow older. It validates that LGBTQ+ identity is part of human identity and not something that people simply grow out of, or an active choice to be that identity made on the individual's part.   The participant here refers, again, to the fact that transgender individuals and those in the LGBTQ+ community at large are humans, which means they have grown and adapted alongside the rest of the species. This leads to a sense of continuation that people can hold on to, as others before them have done. This quote also touches upon how these exemplars offer a sense of community and interpersonal support by reaffirming that LGBTQ+ identity is human and has existed beyond the modern conversations that are being had today.  Participant 1 also expressed a similar view in their focus group, stating:  It's a multifaceted issue. I mean, it's typically not just one thing that makes a person think about taking their lives. To things I think like, the most important thing is like information is the more readily available and spread as well as, like, the data more accessible to people as well. A lot of people both do, and don't respond, like statistics and numbers, I noticed, because there's a lot of like, the trans suicide attempt rate and even the trans suicide rate and, you know, it's a terrifying number. But like, a lot of people don't realize that those are people. In this quote, participant 1 notes that while struggles associated with being an LGBTQ+ person certainly can contribute to suicidal ideation, the correlation isn’t always concrete, and the numbers associated with statistics of suicide are not always impactful because they don’t center the humans who are behind those statistics. It doesn’t mean that these   37 statistics are unimportant, as participant 1 said: “It’s a terrifying number.” The numbers can show that there is clearly a correlation in that high numbers of trans individuals do commit suicide, however there’s a difference between seeing a percentage on the screen and realizing that percentage is based on a person.  A person who had experiences that inevitably led to that moment where they made the choice to take their lives. In this way, statistics can serve as a good secondary source to be able to demonstrate that there is a prevalent problem affecting this group of people. The personal stories and the experiences associated with these statistics though is something that exemplification and personal stories is more fit to be able to expand on though. The next section covers audiences view exemplars and their interaction with resources for suicide prevention. RQ1:\tThe\tResource-centric\texemplar\tIn addition to the findings above, my time with the participants revealed another answer to my first research questions about what exemplars resonated with the participants. Another recurring resonant exemplar came in the form of pairing exemplars and their stories as either directly or indirectly affiliated with suicide prevention resources or by sharing parts of their lived experience that could serve as a helpful tool in coping. When reviewing the story stimulus, both focus groups remarked about one individual sharing even basic tips on how to cope with suicidal ideation or poor mental health. In the journalistic story presented to the focus groups, members of each focus group referred to one exemplar who had expanded on coping mechanisms of relying on their emotional support animals or using positive activities. Participant 7 noted that exemplars should be   38 able to share their struggles but also be able to share solutions or resources for recovery as well. Here’s participant 7’s full quote:  Don't say it's like, they're struggling because they’re like, LGBTQ. You know, just really emphasizing like, the struggles they went through and then again, emphasizing- one of the things that I think is important to me to see in these stories is the solutions and the actions that can be like, taken. Here, the participant identifies the need for exemplars to be able to share their genuine feelings and struggles while also ensuring that there is some resource of tool that can help the audience. In this case, the resource that would be introduced would not come from a prevention organization but rather from the exemplar’s personal experiences of what worked for them.  These exemplars were also more closely seen as aligned to suicide prevention campaigns, as they could take their personal experience and apply to it to that campaign while also partnering with the organization creating the campaign. Participant 7 recalled a campaign they remember seeing from the Trevor Project that worked to partner LGBTQ+ youth with mental health professionals. This is also the area where celebrities were seen as a good source of information or sharing their story in partnership due to their social platform and status. This, however, came with the stipulation that the celebrity was a member of the LGBTQ+ community or was an active ally in the eyes of the community. Participant 10, when prompted for their views on celebrity affiliated campaigns, had this to say: I think it's definitely it really could go two different ways, it depends on who the celebrity is, their relation to the LGBTQ community, if they even care, or if   39 they're just doing it for a paycheck, really makes a difference. But I think that that's something that's very kind of blatant, I think, you know, there's obviously, some open transgender and open queer celebrities who would probably make great subjects if they were open to be in a campaign. But then there's also some who have never, you know, shown any care for the LGBTQ community or any efforts to help in that way.  This quote draws on the concept of authenticity. If an individual has a history or reputation of not taking any interest/being active hostile towards the LGBTQ+ community, it will come off as more of a paid promotion for them than something truly meaningful. Going back to the transgender and openly LGBTQ+ celebrities, this is seen as very different. The subjects of these stories are seen as a much more natural fit for the campaign due to the fact they can relate to the audience through their own experiences and are seen as using their platform or fame for the benefit of the community rather than simply being a part of the campaign for monetary compensation. The idea of authenticity from this section will carry over into the next, only contextualizing the role of the journalist or suicide campaign creator as the one creating or framing that authenticity. RQ2A:\tThe\trole\tof\tthe\tjournalist\tand\tcampaign\tcreator\tTo answer my second research question, about how individuals view the role of journalists and communicators in framing suicide and suicide prevention, I asked participants about how they had seen prior coverage done. Throughout the course of the study, a theme emerged that centered journalists as having a major impact on the way that stories of suicide and suicide prevention in the LGBTQ+ community are told. Across interviews, participants identified that there were decisions and processes that would   40 inevitably impact the way they use personal stories and framing to create stories around suicide and suicide prevention. The concepts associated with this influence fall under news making decisions, coverage intentions and subject sourcing. Participants viewed journalists covering the topic as one of the main forces shaping the perception of these stories, and thereby also either intentionally or unintentionally shaping opinion on the topic for example, participant 8 noted that in some instances news could be seen as a form of ‘entertainment’: I think in journalism, it really depends on you know, where it's being published, I think, first and foremost, you know, what agenda they're trying to push or what idea they want to push. I think it's, you know, news is still a source of entertainment for a lot of people. You know, entertainment is, you know, in heavy quotes, but when people read the news, they want something interesting to think about and to read about. So, they want these stories to be interesting. You know, it's a lot more interesting to say that this black trans woman in this area that's very popular is struggling with this very popular thing, then, Norman from, you know, in the middle of nowhere is gay and he's sad about it. Here, the role of the news is to focus on the things that the audience would find the most engaging or interesting. As the participant notes, there might be cases where certain experiences are being centered for their perceived ability to engage the audience while also delivering information. In terms of the intentions of the journalist who uses these stories, the journalist is seen as making decisions about whose story is the most interesting or branching from participant 8’s analysis, a story that is entertaining or engaging. While it is part of the journalist’s job to tell a story that someone would want to   41 read, putting an emphasis on a story about suicide or suicidal ideation that the journalist sees as the most interesting can come off as disingenuous or create a sense of alienation with LGBTQ+ audiences.  Although like, sometimes it can feel a little bit exploitive. Especially if it's like, I don't know, I think it has to be done in a really purposeful way. You can't just like sell somebody's story. This perception of exploitation is something that can taint the trust of the audience and the journalist or news organization who is writing the story about an exemplar. While standards for what constituted exploitation were not touched on more, there were references to how journalists construct and make salient parts of their stories and thus the exemplars experiences. The success of these stories came down to what the audiences referred to as ‘accuracy’. However, the definitions of what constituted accuracy differed between participants. Three main aspects of what constituted accuracy appeared though between participants: Accuracy as relatability, accuracy in external factors, and accuracy in terms of the facts used within the story. Participant 5’s full quote explores more of how this theme of accuracy plays out within an exemplar’s story: Sometimes it can feel a little bit exploitive. Especially if it's like, I don't know, I think it has to be done in a really purposeful way. You can't just like sell somebody's story. But if you use it in like an authentic way, like if somebody's talking about a time when they were suicidal, and like, I don't know, their like, friends helped them or like this. They like got help from some like [crisis]line or like, from the Trevor Project or something. I think if that's done in like, an authentic way, and it doesn't seem like they're, like, being told to say that stuff. I   42 think that really helps as well. Participant 5 here points to someone being able to tell their story from their own perspective without feeling like they are being told what to say as an important contributor to whether the exemplar is accepted as an accurate and authentic portrayal of suicide and suicidal ideation. The context which is offered alongside these exemplars is also seen as important, with this typically bringing up more of a focus on statistics within the community that explain trends of suicide and suicidal ideation. This context is seen as important for the audience to know so they can truly absorb how large and widespread of an issue this is. However, numbers and quantitative data were also seen as being unable to truly express the nuance of and LGBTQ+ youth experiencing suicidal ideation, which brings us back to accuracy as relatability. Accuracy as relatability refers to the ability for the audience to see the exemplar and framed story as something that aligns with the audience’s own experiences. If an exemplar or message of suicide prevention comes off as unrelatable, then the target audience needing to hear that message will not resonate with it. This can lead to feelings of mistrust with either the organization that told the story or the exemplar themselves. Moving on but keeping with this conversation of relatability, the next section covers another salient exemplar or framing that impacts this sense of relatability: stories that use quantified suicide and mental health data as the main source of information. RQ3:\tDatacentric\tnarratives\t In searching for answers for my third research question, I asked participants to think of any pre-established narratives they might have come across before. Many of the participants mentioned that adding context outside of individual experiences, often   43 referencing quantified data, as a tactic to add to the relatability to the target audience and thereby giving an “accurate” portrayal of suicidal ideation. However, most participants were also quick to point out that these quantified statistics often served to mask the fact that these were representative of humans and their experiences. Participant 9 expands on how this centering on numbers can center a sense of isolation rather than drawing on the concept of a larger shared reality and community: I think one of the things that LGBTQ+, like members really struggle with is like, especially like I feel [in] like smaller towns and everything is remembering that there is a bigger community out there and that there is support out there and I think it can be like really isolating to be queer and like, especially in like small towns or like in like very religious areas. And I think like, you know, emphasizing you know, that there is a bigger world out there that there are people like with like you with very similar and like shared experiences, and like emphasizing like that those people like can connect with you and like help you through it, you know, and I think that can be really important because again, I think that isolation is like a really- it's very especially prevalent in LGBTQ members. Here, we can see that this sense of a larger world and shared reality that individuals could share with is lost because there is no experience to share simply with numbers. While numbers can correlate the issue within the LGBTQ+ community it ultimately fails to make the point that whatever one person experiences is not the sole experience of that entire group of people. This makes it harder to relate and see oneself within the larger issue because they’re unable to see that larger community that this is affecting.   44 When asked about the topic of stories that seemed to center quantitative data, participant 8 also refers to how fact-based narratives, ones that center solely on the statistics of suicide and suicidal ideation are unable to resonate since individuals are not quantifying their life. Rather, they are living their life and see themselves as their own storyteller and character, something that they are unable to emotionally detach from, which then affects the way that they view story from others: It's harder to relate to, like fact-based narrative, because I don't, I don't live in a fact-based narrative day to day, I live a story and I'm telling a story as I'm living my life. So, I think it's very easy to detach myself and not become emotionally invested, when I read a story about something like that, it can still emotionally affect me, but it's not going to have the same depth as reading somebody's diary entry or something like that. Here, participant 8 expresses that their life is a narrative and a story, so it’s easier to understand other stories that cover suicide and suicidal ideation by viewing them as a narrative or story. While statistics and quantitative data might have a slight emotional impact, the perceived interpersonal relationship or interaction of someone sharing their story is more likely to be impactful. The next section goes on to talk about pre-established narratives on suicide that were uncovered throughout the study. RQ3:\tPre-established\tnarratives\t\tWhen asked about narratives or specific instances of suicide within the LGBTQ+ community that they could recall, the members of the first focus group brought up a transgender Tumblr user by the name of Leelah Alcorn who took her own life in 2014.    45 I really remember, Leelah Alcorn's suicide. She was, I don't know, the details on it. But she was a trans girl on I think, Tumblr, and then committed suicide. And that was a big thing like in that community at that time. I was maybe like 13 or 14. But I'm not sure that that got a lot of like, publicity, or attention kind of outside of that like online LGBTQ community. This participant was introduced to this exemplar at a young age, and while they did not directly recall specific details about why Leelah took their lives, it was salient enough that they remembered it, and they also made the connection that there was not a larger focus on this story outside of the existing LGBTQ+ community on Tumblr.  The conversation continued and they expanded further on how this story remained largely within the online community, and what that period was like for conversations about suicide within the community. I mean, I think part of it may have just been like a scope thing, that this was kind of this sort of, like, niche internet community. Yes, to be honest, that period of time felt like, we still weren't talking like super openly about suicide, or about like, LGBTQ suicide, in particular, or about trans suicide in particular. This quote offers a unique insight in that, the participant did not recall news organizations and organizations with suicide prevention missions being the first ones to pick up and talk about this issue. Rather, the conversation around this instance of suicide originated within social media and specifically within the LGBTQ+ community of Tumblr.  This form of online interpersonal communication means that the news and impact of Leelah’s death came first from the community she related to online and then rippled   46 out into larger conversations. The other participant in the first focus group recalled this story and what it felt like seeing this story shared through social media. I would say with the Leelah Alcorn thing, I was on Tumblr, so I did hear about it through that community. It is a very good way to describe it as like, it was really big on Tumblr, and it didn't bleed into other social media sites. But Tumblr has this like, I guess really big population of LGBTQ people and I feel like that was kind of like one of the starting points of more of an active discussion on, you know, specifically trans suicide rates. The unfortunate thing is that it's more talked about but, you know, unfortunately, I feel like there's a lot in this world that's not making that rates go down. It's one of those unfortunate desensitization things. Hearing all these awful things happen still. Participant 1’s quote reveals a dual nature to the story being shared, on the one hand it began a more active and open discussion with members of the social media network on the topic of LGBTQ+ and trans suicide. However, this openness was also set in opposition to available quantified data showing that suicide rates within the community were not going down.  This creates a juxtaposition in that, there was more of an emphasis of openly communicating with struggles of suicidal ideation while also facing an outside society that is not perceived as being helpful or engaged in preventing suicide within LGBTQ+ youth. Both participants here also noted that larger conversations about suicidal ideation and struggles with mental health had shifted after this event.  While not directly attributing this to the story of Leelah Alcorn, there was a sense that this was a starting point from which conversations became more prevalent within the   47 years after this instance. In searching to learn a little bit more about the context of this story, it seems like it did in fact end up making it onto at least one legacy news station (Mohney, 2014). However, the participants really focused on the larger impact of Alcorn’s death as remaining within that sector of the LGBTQ+ community. RQ3:\tThe\tFamilial\tLoss\tframe\t Another interesting frame of narrative that was prevalent throughout the course of the study was stories of LGBTQ+ suicide that made the experiences of the family members of the deceased the most salient aspect of the story, in some cases appearing as the “voice” for the individual who was no longer living. Choosing to use family members as sources means centering on their perspectives about the suicide or suicidal ideation and thus frames the wording used to describe it. The effects of this frame were interpreted differently by participants throughout the study with some feeling that policing had occurred regarding who “was close enough to tell the story.” As socially unacceptable and not considerate of those dealing with bereavement after a completed suicide. Participant 12 also noted that the intentions of the person left behind were important for how to interpret their involvement. There should never be anyone policing, like, “Hey, you didn't know them that well like because you don't know the relationship they had with that person”. So, it is very nuanced. It's hard to like draw guidelines of who should and shouldn't be allowed to talk about something. But I think just in general, if your goal is to pay respects to that person and maybe on a that they were passionate about and say, like, you know, they're not with us anymore. But we can carry on doing something effective for the world that they would have wanted, then I think that is   48 definitely something that should happen. But if- if your goal is to make people upset, even if that goal is to make you upset just to further a cause, then I don't think that's a good thing. This participant viewed the role of the source talking about the exemplar who had passed as one that was nuanced. The participant noted that if the intention was to pay respect to that exemplar and advocate for a cause or belief, they were passionate about, that this was acceptable. However, they also perceived there being instances where the individual or family member being used as a subject having a goal to create an intense emotional response in the audience who sees the message. The participant did not expand on what someone might do that in this instance to elicit that strong emotional support, participant 3 had a much more pointed remark and perspective when speaking on the use of secondary sources such as family members, stating: Well, if it was me, if like, it was my mom up there, I would be offended and I'm like, I'm looking at this and like they're literally, not representing the people like you are literally silencing the people who you're supposed to be speaking for, by not interviewing them by not giving them the chance to share their story. It's like, is the story about the parent? No. So why are we why are we doing it? Now, the obvious difference between these two quotations is the context of the stories being talked about. In participant 12’s quote, they are referring to an instance where the individual whose stories is being told is no longer alive to tell the story. In the hypothetical instance being shared by participant 3, the individual dealing with these suicidal ideations is still alive and capable of telling their story.    49 In this case, the participant is critical of the choice to use a family member, who may not fully understand the queer lived experience of the exemplar, as a primary source of information or participant of a story. In the instance of participant 2, they had spoken candidly about having a ‘complete identity’ at their undergrad college and with the relationships there, while there was a feeling of losing their identity every time they returned home to their family.  This dynamic explains why in the case of participant 3, their family members would not make a very good secondary source to talk about their mental health or suicidal ideation with. Rather, those family members would likely give an account that bases their account on their own views on LGBTQ+ identity. In doing so preventing those more impactful experiences being shared by the person who it most directly affects and can speak the most candidly about what they were feeling or experiencing. The autonomy of someone being able to speak for themselves and share their experiences authentically ties back into the prior theme of lived experiences. Obviously this same autonomy cannot be offered to those who had already passed from suicide. However, in instances where the individual is still alive, a person who has lived their life as a queer individual is more capable of expressing those experiences than those around them because they are aware of what aspects of their environment and society were the most impactful.  RQ4:\tExemplars\tas\tstigma-reinforcing\tor\tstigma-negating\tMy fourth research question asked how LGBTQ+ individuals saw exemplars impacting the stigma surrounding conversations about suicide and mental health. Participants in both the in-depth interviews and focus groups brought up that was that,   50 while stigma around talking about suicide and mental health did exist, typically the LGBTQ+ community was seen as more open to having conversations about these difficult topics. Multiple participants throughout the study suggested that for the most part, conversations about mental health and suicide prevention are more prevalent within the LGBTQ+ community than larger society. Subject 7 notes: I feel like for the most part, mental health is more of an open subject for LGBTQ+ people versus like the general population at large because so many LGBTQ+ people have mental health issues. This position shared by the subject reflects this general view that LGBTQ+ individuals are likely more comfortable talking about mental health due to the high saturation of mental health issues prevalent across the community. Participants 6 and 11 both spoke about how, in their own friend groups it was openly talked about, albeit perhaps with more of a sense of gallows humor. With subject 6 giving the metaphor that, in their group of friends: “You could throw a rock blindfolded after spinning around in a circle you're gonna hit a mentally ill person. You're going to.”  In this metaphor, the saturation of mental health issues within the subject’s group of queer friends meant that it was not hard to find someone struggling. This perceived and statistically backed prevalence though could also lead to further stigma from those outside of the LGBTQ+ community, as expressed by Subject 11’s quote below: Because I know, I think with a lot of situations, that, we tend to try to keep it [issues with mental health] more hush-hush. I think the only downside about it is, is that, unfortunately, there's always going to be people who are going to use those stories and to try to use it as like, this type of like, self-confirmation bias of   51 like, \"oh, that's why I say you shouldn't be that, because this is what's happening!\" I think that regardless of that, we should still move forward. Because they're gonna do that regardless. Participant 11’s quote offers an interesting perspective on how exemplars who are open about their mental health or suicidal ideation can be seen by individuals outside of the LGBTQ+ community as confirming the perceived direct association with queer identity and mental illness. The gaze of the cisgender and/or heterosexual audience is also seen as needing to consistently confirm their pre-conceived notions about the relationship between suicidal ideation and one’s status as a queer person.  While exemplars were seen as useful in creating a sense of community and closing distance between individuals, this did not mean that they were without their issues. One issue that arises from the use of exemplification is its inability to fully be representative of the diversity within the community. Subject 11 identified themselves within their interview as a person of color and gave perspective to how exemplars that do not take diversity and intersectional identity seriously can be ineffective or even harmful. They also noted that messaging about the causes of suicidal ideation or poor mental health within queer people could be stifled by the fact that those experiences are impacted by other aspects of the identity: I feel like that speaks a lot in terms of like how a lot of people feel, especially because it gets very, it feels very segregated at times when it comes to even just talking to each other about these types of situations. Because maybe one of us relate on the terms of like, oh, your religious trauma, I have religious trauma, etc. Within the religion, trauma is   52 also very different, because like, a Hispanic person, a black person, a white person, [an] Asian person might have completely different situations and the type of religious trauma.  The subject uses the example of people from different ethnic backgrounds having different types of religious trauma. This is logical as there are many different religious systems across cultures, with their own emphasis on different values and traditions. In this way, while the theoretical exemplar does share the experience of religious trauma, the specifics of that trauma and the way and audience member might interpret that could be different. In other words, the exemplar fits because it has religious trauma, but the specifics of that religious trauma will likely be different from others.  For people of color and those living with disabilities, there was a sense that layered oppression from racism and ableism ultimately prevented them from benefiting from the perceived community support and shared sense of reality. Subject 12, though they do not identify as a person of color themselves, had a good synopsis of what this effect looked like: We were talking about how, like, often suicidal ideation will stem from mental illness but the environment your experience around that can really increase that likelihood. So, say like, for example, if like a black disabled trans person, like they're hearing all of the transphobic messaging and then they're feeling all the racist messaging and like all the, you know, ableist messaging and like, there's so many different factors that are affecting their mental health that to just say, oh, well, the queer people got your back. You also need to address, you know, the racism that they're experiencing, [the] ableism that they're experiencing. So, I think being able to hear from all different parts of a community and then being   53 able to hear from different communities that you belong to, is going to be the most impactful for stopping suicides. Subject 12’s analysis here gives an insight into how an individual’s likelihood to experience suicidal ideation or poor mental health is not solely based on their LGBTQ+ identity. In fact, being LGBTQ was seen by some participants as not shielding an individual from systemic oppression or messaging associated with racism, ableism or even transphobia. While messages might be trying to come off as if they’re understanding, if they do not understand the lived experiences of their audience and how those intersectional aspects of their identity make them more vulnerable to suicidal ideation, then they are not fully addressing all the issues within their lives that could be compounding upon one another. This also contributes to a sense of further social distance that stifles these individuals and their ability to see themselves as a larger part of a community that will support them. This in turn can make it harder for the individual to seek support or feel supported, as the part of their identity being stigmatized and seen as the biggest contributor to their feelings are not being considered. Subject 11’s comment below is an excellent example of how this might manifest itself within the individual and how it could even contribute to reinforcing stigma around suicidal ideation within the LGBTQ+ community.  I think it's going back and kind of what I talked about earlier, it's very frustrating, because some people tend to use that [suicidal ideation] as a reason to be like, 'Oh, my gosh, this is why you're all struggling' or be like, 'This is why I said I don't support the community, because look at how you all are.' It's very frustrating   54 because it's like, actually, that's not even true. Not even all the people in the community necessarily have those experiences. Because of them being in the community. Some of them are literally just like, ‘oh, well, I am this but there's another thing that's happened to me related to my identity, that's really the reason of why I feel this way’. So, I think it's very, I guess I would say one sided in a sense of viewing it completely as like, the reason why you feel that way.  This quote reflects the subject’s feelings that, while exemplars and conversations at large are typically beneficial to members of the LGBTQ+ community, there is also a sense that they might too closely associate queer identity and suicidal ideation with a direct connection. In this instance, the exemplar’s queer identity is linked directly to their suicidal ideation or struggles with mental health without context of how other parts of their experience might be seen as more of the root of these feelings.  This can be seen as frustrating because, as the subject put it, not every LGBTQ+ individual is struggling with that part of their identity and their treatment because of it. There is also an interesting viewpoint that Subject 11 saw other people outside of the LGBTQ+ community attributing poor mental health as the fault of identifying as. Rather, the source of these problems is being attributed to their identity. Going back to the theme of living into the future, Subject 12 describes how the concept of wanting a future is important for those suffering suicidal ideation, but the way that future is framed or exemplified should not be shown as a one-size-fits all perspective. Here’s subject 12’s full quote on this: Obviously, the goal when someone is suicidal is to get them to not commit suicide, and the best way to do that is to get them to want to have a future. But   55 you don't want to go into that assuming you know what that future looks like for them, you know, like, that may not be the future they want. And that also may not be any kind of future they can realistically have. Whereas they can still have a good future like, I don't know, I just think there's so much assumption in those very, like broad brushy like, ‘oh, there's still like, there's still sunshine, there's still hope’. And it's just like, I don't know, I'm not phrasing this right, but it just feels very out of touch. Like, they haven't actually talked to anyone who was suicidal and asked them about like, I think it was like I kind of mentioned this earlier, but like, if you go back to just at the core of it, having empathy and trying to figure out why they feel that way. Here again, intersectional identity means that broad messages painting the experiences of an individual can come off as disingenuous and incapable of fully capturing the nuances of a person’s lived experiences and struggles. The concept of what is realistic for the future is decided by the individual and the environment which they’re a part of. If systemic oppression unrelated to LGBTQ+ experience is the main contributor to suicidal ideation, the future that someone is capable of having is seen as stipulated by this systemic oppression.  Understanding how this layered oppression impacts the individual experience is key to being able to make them believe that a future is possible. Understanding how identities intersect with one another to create a distinct experience of suicidal ideation and recovery is the key to being able to fully address the issue within all subsects of the LGBTQ+ community and ensuring that LGBTQ+ youth see themselves being represented for who they are and what they’ve experienced rather than what someone   56 else thinks it looks like or should look like. Subject 3 encapsulates this concept with the next featured quote: I also think it's hard to because I feel like not everybody, like has the same reasons [for suicidal ideation], you know, and it's like, specifically in the LGBTQ plus community, it's like, yes, there are people who are getting disowned, kicked out of their house. But then there are also people who are just living with their homophobic parents who are making comments every single day, or there are people who just are hiding who they are. So, it's like different struggles. This quote reveals an interesting perspective on how the mental stressors and elements that might contribute to suicidal ideation are not the same for everyone. In this case, the subject refers to some of the more “extreme” cases of homophobia such as individuals being disowned and forced to leave their home as a valid lived experience. However, there is also the example given that some individuals live with unsupportive parents who have that struggle manifest in a slightly more subtle, but repeated fashion. Rather than one drastic event that is deeply emotionally distressing and seen as the cause for suicidal ideation, there are multiple smaller events or instances that are repetitive. This feeling of not being one direct cause here echoed throughout most of the interviews during the study.   This chapter covered the findings of my main research questions that I had initially proposed at the beginning if the study. The next chapter dedicates itself to taking these findings and expanding on them by providing practical and theoretical implications for further work.   57 Chapter\tFive:\tDiscussion\t My first research question found that participants perceived exemplars that provided resources for those struggling with suicidal ideation, as well as some social media exemplars to be particularly resonant. Research question two, about the perceived impact of framing and exemplification, revealed that communicators and journalists could heavily influence the perceptions around suicide and suicide prevention in their framing, and sourcing choices. My third question about pre-established narratives found that participants found that data-centric narratives and narratives or instances of suicide on social media were existent and part of participant recollection. My fourth question which asked how LGBTQ+ individuals perceived the impact of exemplars on stigma around suicide and suicidal ideation found that exemplars could be either stigma-negating or stigma-reinforcing.  The prevailing takeaway from this study about exemplification in LGBTQ+ suicide public health messaging is that exemplars are capable of re-humanizing queer experiences and offering a sense of community and shared reality that positively affects the audiences who encounter these messages, with limitations and considerations for those who are creating the message or mass communicating the message. In essence, the findings of this study corroborate other studies on the Papageno effect (Domaradzki, 2021; Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2010; Niederkrotenthaler & Till, 2020; Sisask et al., 2012), as earnest conversations about struggles with suicidal ideation and mental health were associated with a perceived resonance within the audience. This study also reinforces prior literature findings that depictions or stories that include graphic   58 descriptors or specific methods of suicide attempts as being associated with negative outcomes and overall unhelpful for the audience viewing the message. Throughout the study, it became clear that many of the participants were not running into exemplars of suicide or suicide prevention from well-known news outlets typically. While some noted campaigns from organizations like the Trevor Project, their ability to recall the exact messages and the individuals associated with these campaigns was limited. However, most participants were quick to mention their usage of social media, in particular Twitter and TikTok, and having encountered individuals sharing their own personal struggles with mental health or suicidal ideation. It seems that the one-on-one format of TikTok is uniquely set up to where individuals tell stories to connect with community members on a seemingly individual basis. The use of TikTok simulates the one-to-one storytelling that has been prevalent throughout human history. TikTok also lends itself to catering to the attention span of younger generations and information being found more ‘organically.’ TikTok’s function as a search engine (Zhang, 2021) also makes it a starting place for seeking out information. Understanding how and why an individual might navigate to spaces dealing with suicide prevention and mental health on the platform could prove useful for understanding more about how to effectively reach those individuals with resources and prevention messages.  There is also a need to further explore how TikTok as a platform suggests content to users based on their mutual contacts. One participant in the study mentioned how, while scrolling through memes on TikTok, they were suddenly subjected to news that someone within the LGBTQ+ community had taken their own life. Social media platforms should consider using trigger or content warnings for videos discussing topics that could prove   59 to be harmful to mental health. Given the tendency for the algorithm to suggest videos based upon what one contact shared, this could cause this type of content to more frequently appear within someone’s newsfeed without them intentionally seeking this content out. One potential avenue for future study in this area could be a mixed-method content analysis of videos that focus on suicide prevention within the LGBTQ+ community, like the work done by McCashin & Murphy (2023). This would be important to give insight into what the content looks like on the platform, what format it takes, and how it can be used effectively. The next section of the chapter discusses the role that public health organizations must play in contributing to suicide prevention and creating messages that center the human. Public\thealth\torganization\tinvolvement\tOf note, throughout the course of the study, no participant distinctly pointed out a campaign geared toward the LGBTQ+ community that came from a state or federal public health organization. While this may not be true across the country it is revealing in and of itself that none of the participants mentioned campaigns created by these sorts of organizations. This could be due to facing issues of trying to fund campaigns specifically geared towards LGBTQ+ youth in states where there is little legal protection for these individuals. It could also be because LGBTQ+ populations or identities might not be accounted for in school records and therefore the real number of LGBTQ+ students isn’t being captured and is therefore seen as a non-issue. The only potential mention of this sort of involvement came with mentions of public school-based campaigns, though no participant mentioned one being geared towards LGBTQ+ individuals. The participants   60 did not directly relate these to state or federal public health organizations, nor could they recall the distinct organization that was putting these campaigns together. These campaigns were also perceived by participants overwhelmingly negatively by the participants. Large parts of the critiques here came from depictions or messages that oversimplified the issue of suicide or mental health struggles and ultimately left a lasting negative impression on the audience. This does not mean that there is no place for these campaigns, but rather that there is a need to evaluate their effectiveness and find a way to make them more positively impactful. It’s ultimately unclear how these campaigns impact the lasting trust on individuals who view them, however it seems these campaigns do leave lasting impressions.  One of the characteristics that was an issue for participants was the infrequency of being introduced to suicide prevention messages. One participant recalled that they had a very high suicide rate at their high school, and after one student lost their life, the school began to hang up posters in response to the death. The participant recalled than both they and several other students felt that the campaign made them angry as it appeared after an individual had passed, and then within weeks was taken down. While this exact experience was not shared across all participants, the impression that these types of reactive campaigns were ineffective and proved to be more frustrating than helpful.  The issue was that these campaigns and the conversations about mental health and suicidal ideation were only being brought up after someone had already lost their live. The participants expressed a frustration that there wasn’t enough being done to support and facilitate honest dialogues before someone had lost their lives. If the message only comes around when there is an incident of suicide or suicidal ideation, then it is not   61 serving the purpose of suicide prevention, it is just providing forced talking points to show there was some effort made in touching on the topic. This is avoidable using consistency with campaigns and taking a more proactive approach in preventing suicide by providing individuals with the sense that this is not something campaign creators are just now thinking about.  There was also a perceived discrepancy in what the campaign was saying and what it was trying to accomplish. By this, I mean that while the posters were created with the goal of fostering a better understanding and empathy with students, it came off as more diminishing of the issues they were facing or too simplified to be able to truly resonate with these students. Obviously mass communication campaigns will likely need to keep some parts of the message the same no matter where the campaign would be viewed from. However, making sure that these messages are not so overly simplified that they equate suicidal ideation or depression as “being sad” is important. If the message is nor being perceived as part of a larger conversation these youths are having, or further facilitating these conversations then they likely would not be received well. An example of exploring the effectiveness of these campaigns and the stories they tell could come in the form of a content analysis of the most prominently distributed school-based health campaigns covering suicide and mental health issues. Seeing as this was a recurring conversation within participants throughout the study, it leads me to believe that these campaigns when introduced during an individual’s formative years, has a lasting impact on how they perceived other campaigns.  The next section discusses how stigma might be made salient through either framing or use of exemplification.   62 Understanding\thow\tstigma\tand\thope\tare\tmade\tsalient\t\tOne aspect not covered by this study’s research questions is the sociological pressures, such as routines or the perception of necessary objectivity put upon journalists in their coverage of suicide and mental health issues within the LGBTQ+ community specifically. Because the study focused predominantly on how LGBTQ+ individuals viewed the use of exemplification in suicide prevention messaging and journalistic stories, questions remain as to how journalists and communicators working on these topics make their choices. One theoretical model that offers promise in exploring these issues is the Reese and Shoemaker (2016) hierarchy of influences model. The model offers different levels of evaluation from an individual basis up to an organizational or societal level, offering opportunities to explore how each impact how journalists frame suicide and suicidal ideation within the LGBTQ+ community.  One potential research question is how these communicators choose the exemplars and sources that they use in the story. In reference to the findings chapter, there was a perception that journalists sometimes went to family members. participants saw this as more prevalent within journalism when an individual had died and was unable to speak for themselves, and there was also mention of stories where an individual was struggling with suicidal ideation and their family was interviewed rather than them. Participants may not have been fully familiar with the journalistic practice of sourcing children, where obtaining parental consent it typically considered the norm.  This aspect of journalism might be invisible to the community. In this case pushing for transparency in why a journalist chose to source their story the way they did would be helpful for building trust the with the community and audience. It would also be   63 beneficial for journalists to understand going into interviews with family member sources that these individuals could also be unsupportive of the child’s identity, which could be a contributing factor to the child’s own internalized stigma and struggle with suicidal ideation. Understanding that the parent or family member cannot fully explicate on the inner workings of queer life and lived experiences is important to contextualize the story.  Participants within the study repeatedly referenced the role of journalists and communicators' power in how they choose to source and tell their stories. These choices ended up impacting the reception of what was being shared as well as trust in the source that was providing the information. For journalists, participants perceived there being pressure both from the newsroom the journalist worked for, as well as internal pressure from the journalist themselves to frame the story in a certain manner or to provide the perspective of specific participants.  This process is largely something that is not visible to the audience when reading a story, but the subtleties in framing and the perceived intentions of coverage were not lost on them. This impacted the study participants’ trust in the journalist or newsroom’s ability to adequately display the nuance associated with these types of stories. More importantly, participants attributed this to furthering existing societal stigma and making the issue of suicide and suicidal ideation within the population worse. Hinting that the expectations of the LGBTQ+ community and the goals of journalism or journalists as being at odds with one another.  This leads me to believe that one aspect that would be important to study is how journalists navigate the perceived obligation to objective coverage (Schudson, 2001) while covering a topic within a community that is already a constant target of stigma and   64 societal disdain. This perceived obligation of covering a topic objectively likely comes into conflict with the LGBTQ+ individual’s desire for humanizing coverage and an overall sense of empathy for the struggles that they’re facing. Journalists might be met with protests from audience members or editorial staff for not showing an “alternative viewpoint” to balance out the views of those in the LGBTQ+ community. They might also be accused of being activists or politically motivated when they choose to cover the LGBTQ+ community and center their perspective.  Understanding how journalists navigate this ethical terrain and what forces are influencing their decisions would give a better idea of their perspective and what can be done to ensure that coverage and storytelling is done in a fashion that does not contribute to danger or stigma against LGBTQ+ youth. This would mean, when possible, centering the lived experiences and stories of these individuals in their own words. It also includes too closely associating their LGBTQ+ identity as the sole root of any suicidal ideation or mental illness. While there is a statistical relationship between being an LGBTQ+ person and living with mental health issues, a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity is not the cause for these issues, and this is important to emphasize. It is the way the world and society around them reacts to that identity and creates an environment either ill-suited or actively hostile to them. The same idea is also consistent with other communicators who aren’t journalists but may still be telling or creating campaigns around the stories of individuals. In this case, the focus of research would be centered more on how these campaigns and the people creating them center the issue and make use of the individuals. An example would be someone creating a campaign but only choosing to show white individuals.    65 What are the biases that led the communicator to thinking that kind of representation would be most resonant? How did the campaign creation process influence these decisions, was it decided according to statistical likelihood based on mortality statistic? Or was there pressure from within the organization or routine of creating these campaigns that influenced the communicators view on how to use these personal stories?  Answering these questions serve to better understand the process of creating a campaign or story centered around an exemplar, building trust between the LGBTQ community and journalists. Knowing the considerations within these processes would make it easier to understand the roles communicators play and what parts of these processes lend themselves to being more vulnerable to stigma being made salient rather than a message of hope and recovery. This can create a space for collaboration between the LGBTQ+ community and communicators to overcome blind spots for those writing messages or stories while giving the community some level of power in holding communicators accountable. The next section summarizes the theoretical implications that this study poses and how they might be explored by other scholars via quantitative or mixed-method studies. Theoretical\timplications\tThis study largely corroborates Cover’s (2012) four frames of queer youth suicide discourses. The reporting of suicide statistics in queer youth as a major frame was reflected in the remarks of several participants. Their interpretations of the effectiveness ranged from seeing the quantified data as being useful for education on the topic to serving as a first-hand source that conflates mental illness and suicide as interwoven with queer identity.    66 What Cover’s study did not identify, and something that arose through the conversations during this research, is that legislative impact on LGBTQ+ lived experiences is largely left out of these stories. Nearly every participant within my study referred to the current anti-LGBTQ+ legislation being passed across the country as a major proponent contributing to poor mental health suicide within the community. They connected the legislation to denying healthcare access to those who need it. These laws were also viewed as forcing LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender individuals, out of shared social space, leading to further stigma against the community. In this case communicators face a difficult task of trying to show how larger societal issues contribute to suicide and suicidal ideation rather than these being the fault of the individual. This is not an easy thing to do with narrative messages as there is only so much attention and time people can give to consuming information. One potential avenue for creating messages here is to emphasize the shared reality that this legislation imposts on members of the LGBTQ+ community.  This is not simply happening on an individual basis but is rather a systemic attempt towards erasing people who have this shared identity. Therefore, it’s not the role of the people facing these issues to have to humanize themselves when legislative and societal environments try to make their ability to live publicly have consequences that can deeply affect them. This is not something that was chosen by these people, it is that the environment they exist in has deemed them as dangerous or deviant in some manner and serves only to ostracize them. This concept of social distance created by legislation and how this connection arises within larger mass communication coverage could be explored either by mixed methods   67 content analysis (Castro et al., 2023) Future research would do well to explore how journalists and suicide prevention campaigns draw connections between anti-LGBTQ legislation and the impact it has on LGBTQ+ suicidal ideation. LGBTQ+ individuals often face politicization of their identities, which ends up impacting their mental health. This intolerance can also exist outside of politics, such as within social or family contexts, meaning the stigma around this identity can manifest in multiple ways. It would be interesting and useful in the way that it could further investigate how they view this politicization as impacting their psychological wellbeing and conversations around suicidal ideation.  It may be that it is difficult to fully disentangle the topics of politicized identity (Duncan et al., 2017) and legislation in the context of mental health, as they likely have a direct environment that LGBTQ+ individuals must navigate in their lived experiences. The next section outlines how these concepts might come together into a theoretical model for understanding the impact framing queer identity can have on conversations about suicide and suicidal ideation within the LGBTQ+ community and serves as a main takeaway for the study conducted. Another important factor that is relevant to the research comes in the form of examining mass media depictions of how family conversations serve to educate on suicide, suicidal ideation, and mental illness at large. Pecchioni’s (2011) study established the family as central to sense-making, so this would impact the understanding of mental health and illnesses as well as their complexities. This would include suicidal ideation. The World Health organization also describes mental illness as: “health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking, and behavior and are associated with   68 distress and/or impaired social, work, or family functioning” (World Health Organization, 2018).   Given the findings from my study that stories on suicide and suicide prevention can sometimes center on familial loss or bereavement rather than the individual’s issues, it would stand to reason that there would be mass-mediated messages that demonstrate this dynamic that could be studied. The next section covers the main takeaway from this study, a theoretical model to help explain how framed mass media messages can impact LGBTQ+ youth seeing these messages. This is a personal creation that I hope contributes to the larger understanding of both how stigmatic messages about suicide and queer identity impacts LGBTQ+ youth. Pathologized\tidentity\tmodel\t\tUltimately, this study sought to build a grounded theory for understanding the use of exemplification and framing in public health messaging around suicide and suicide prevention in LGBTQ+ youth. Using the operationalized terms that came out of my grounded theory coding process, I developed a model of understanding the impact that this can have. A model can serve as a visual representation of the concepts and themes that create theory. Bringing the intangible aspects into focus and making them easier to understand and implement into quantitative study or experimental design. In this case, the model shows the impact of a specific frame about a specific group (LGBTQ+ youth). I have named it the model of pathologized identity framing’s impact. My choice in wording came from a point during the research process that I realized some of the information and experiences the participants where sharing was hinting towards a framing that may not always be made overt. Below, I have attached visuals to aid in   69 understanding how LGBTQ+ youth build their perceptions of suicide and suicidal ideation, and the effect framing messages has on stigma surrounding the topic.  Figure\t4-\tModel\tof\tPathologized\tIdentity\tFraming's\tImpact\t  The model begins with the formation of attitudes toward suicide and suicidal ideation. This is created through personal biases, lived experiences, societal (external) stigma, and internalized stigma being introduced to the audience through interactions with society and other individuals. This process can be explained in part by social-cognitive theory of   70 learning (Martin, 2004), where society and culture shape the viewpoint of the audience. These beliefs are then embedded into the LGBTQ+ audience member where they mold the individual’s views on suicide and suicidal ideation. On this level, internalized and external stigma interact with one another, often reinforcing each other. The same can be said for lived experiences feeding into biases and vice versa. Many of the concepts within the model are interconnected.  The next step in the model is the audience member being introduced to a framed, mass-communicated message that places the locus of suicidal ideation and suicide on queer identity. In doing so, this creates the perception that suicidal ideation, suicide, and mental illness are natural results that occur due to someone’s identity as an LGBTQ+ individual. From here, there are two divergent paths that the individual experiencing this framed message could go down.  On one hand, they could reject this framing and ultimately ascribe the stigma associated with suicide and suicidal ideation as cultivated by societal stigma. This can be considered the more positive outcome for the individual as it centers the locus and cause of suicide, suicidal ideation, and mental illness on that of external stigma towards the LGBTQ+ identity, rather than with the identity itself. This in turn does not contribute further to internal or external stigma towards queer identity but attributes it to attitudes and individuals who perpetuate this framing of queer identity as pathological. The other outcome of the model is the individual encountering this framed message can accept the framing of LGBTQ+ identity as being the locus. In this instance, this means accepting LGBTQ+ identity as the cause of suicide, suicidal ideation, and mental illness in general. In doing so, this solidifies the internal stigma within the audience while   71 also flowing back into the external stigma that served to shape the individual’s perspective in the first place. While pathologized identity is a code that originated within the study and the data, there is also literature that uses similar terminology (Margolin, 2023). My rationale for choosing this title for the model comes from the larger theme of dehumanization LGBTQ+ individuals face that arose from the data. The term stems from pathology, a concept typically associated with medicine and psychiatry, that labels something as abnormal or unhealthy.  The next section outlines the practical implications this study offers to journalists and communicators alike, in the hope that they can use exemplification and framing of issues to prevent suicide rather than feed back into the loop of stigmatic messaging around the topic. Practical\timplications\t\tSeveral practical implications serve as the main takeaways from this study for journalists. For one, silence on the issue, even if it is well-intentioned to avoid suicide contagion or uphold newsroom values, could be perceived by LGBTQ+ individuals as indifference to the issues facing their community.  Secondly, journalists and communicators creating suicide prevention campaigns hold a large amount of power in shaping the message and tone of their stories. If done in a way that humanizes the exemplar, rather than repeating or reinforcing the narrative of suicide or mental illness that relate directly back to queer identity, this can have an impact on the audience that is seeing the story and aid in reducing their internal stigma and shifting the conversation around external stigma that influences perceptions about suicide and suicide ideation within LGBTQ+ communities.    72 This means not framing stories about LGBTQ+ people in a way that makes it seem like they have suddenly appeared and are a new concept or fad, but human beings living as who they know themselves to be. Not as a condition or malignance needs to be erased, but a human being that is struggling because the world around them can be cruel. Salience needs to be centered around resources available to them, and ways that they were able to realize they were a part of a much larger and diverse community they could seek support from.  Third, stories of suicidal ideation cannot simply be boiled down to one factor as a cause. The intricacies of lived experiences and intersectional identities mean that multiple factors of layered oppression or privilege impact an individual’s experience. Boiling these lived experiences and the experiences of layered oppression down into one single exemplar and not acknowledging that it is not entirely representative, can further contribute to stigma or push individuals of different races, ethnicities, and disability experiences out of the way in favor of giving one homogenous example.  The LGBTQ+ community is not consistent with people who all look, act, or live the same. It encompasses many different cultures and experiences and is not synonymous with mental illness. Identifying this nuance shows the issue's complexity and indicates that solutions are not always the same for individuals across the community.  In this case, ensuring that there are multiple exemplars being represented within a campaign or story can be efficient in showcasing that diversity. Understanding who the exemplar being used is, and whose identity and lived experiences they most align with is the best way to portray accuracy and de-stigmatize these conversations is also another efficient way to use exemplification. This means being specific about who is being   73 targeted with the message and finding an exemplar that is a part of that target audience is extremely important.  Rather than using the exemplar as an overt, sweeping descriptor for suicide within LGBTQ+ youth at large, it can be used to make those who might be marginalized even within the community finally feel seen.  For example, a black transgender woman would be more effective in speaking to people with the same identity as they understand the nuances of layered oppression associated with the black transgender experience. Fourth, and predominantly from a suicide prevention campaign perspective, social media (specifically TikTok) offers a grass-roots option for being able to engage LGBTQ+ youth in a manner that feels more authentic and more likely to reach them. The next section of this chapter covers the limitations associated with the methodology of the study, the procedure, and my own limitations as a human being and researcher. Limitations\tSome limitations did set boundaries for the findings within the study. One such limitation was the sample size for the focus groups. While the original plan had been to have four focus groups with six to eight people, some individuals did not respond to schedule a time or otherwise did not show up to the focus group. This meant that the diversity of opinion within the focus groups was not very wide, as only two perspectives were being drawn. While this was not ideal, the focus groups showed diversity in their shared opinions. The data was still very insightful when the comparative analysis was used against in-depth interviews.   Another limitation came in the sample being unable to fully demonstrate the community's diversity. The LGBTQ+ community encompasses many ethnic, racial,   74 socio-economic, and cultural identities. While the recruitment of participants was helped with snowball sampling to ensure that information-rich participants participated, there was no way to fully encapsulate the perspective of every identity within the LGBTQ+ community’s umbrella. This means that the data gathered largely comes from individuals who might identify the same way and bring similar viewpoints across in the data. This inability to “fully” capture the community means that the collected and saturated data likely comes from a narrower section of the community than is desirable.  I also have an internal limitation as a researcher in this situation. While I tried to see and evaluate data from the perspectives of the lived experiences shared by my study participants, I have my perspective and internalized biases as a cis-gendered, white, gay man that could have influenced the analysis of the data. Having also myself dealt with suicidal ideation and mental health issues, this could also have impacted what I perceived as the most important findings and my selection of what information I wanted to share.  While this may not fall distinctly into the role of a limitation, the current influx of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation both around the country and in the state where the research was conducted likely influenced participation and willingness to contribute to the conversation. As this is a very serious and often dark subject, individuals who might have otherwise been willing to participate may not have felt safe having these conversations or were reluctant to have larger group conversations without knowing the other participants.  For future studies, researchers should also introduce a participant check. Due to time constraints for completing this study I was unable to do so, however it is important to build trust within the community and participants by ensuring that the interpretation of quotes is appropriate.    75 In mentioning focus groups, it should also be noted that were I to do this study again I likely would have introduced the stimuli used in the focus groups into the in-depth interviews. This would have given something more tangible to go from and elicit responses from the participant rather than relying on them to be able to recall and evaluate campaigns from memory. This also would have likely helped center the findings and make it easier to evaluate across both focus group and IDI participants and see what specific differentiations each had when presented with the stimuli. Conclusion\t\tThis study was conducted to advance scholarly knowledge within the field of mass communication and build a grounded theory in how academics can further study the use of exemplars and frames in suicide prevention messaging towards the LGBTQ+ community. The study has produced a model for understanding the impact of framing in suicide and suicide prevention messaging on LGBTQ+ youth. The study’s operationalized themes, categories and concepts could prove useful for scholars looking to do experiment design to study the topic, or for those creating suicide prevention messages to consider.  The study has highlighted key concepts that could be used for quantitative and mixed-method studies moving forward to analyze texts that use exemplification and framing. The study has also highlighted the need for further research into how the sociological pressures placed upon journalists and communicators shape their process of sourcing, writing, and framing suicide within the LGBTQ+ community. As one of the participants so aptly put it in their interview: “I don’t think that we should have to prove our worth and our humanity.” Suicidal ideation, and mental illness   76 are not synonymous with the entirety of lived queer experiences and should not be made out to look as such by those covering the topic. The power a story has is based on the care with which it is told, and creating frames and messages that center LGBTQ+ youth’s identities as the root of their issues is both dehumanizing, reinforcing of stigma, and actively choosing to ignore their lived experiences. For LGBTQ+ youth and LGBTQ+ individuals in general, the effects of dehumanization and are often linked to the outcome of suicidal ideation. While this topic may be difficult to recruit for due to the current legislative and societal atmosphere, this should not discourage work on this topic. If anything, this should serve as a reminder for how important this research topic is. While it might initially prove to be difficult to find participants, there are those who are willing to speak about their experiences so long as they are sought out in good faith and taken seriously. Continued silence will only lead to the topic remaining stigmatized and maintaining a status quo that disregards the lived experiences of LGBTQ+ people.  As journalists, strategic communicators, and humans, we must be cognizant of how taking the story of one individual and sharing it can either help or harm others. We must strive to rehumanize LGBTQ+ identities so that, when faced with messages framed to blame them for their own issues, when faced with stories that only serve to further drive them into darkness, they can see their own humanity and know that even if it might not seem like it at the time, there is a future for them. One they get to decide. Reminding them that there is hope and support for them, that their struggles are valid, and most of all: They deserve to be able to tell their own story and be heard.    77 References American Psychiatric Association.

    "abstract": "Suicide in LGBTQ+ individuals, especially youth, is a growing public health issue. However, the literature on this issue within the field of mass communication is under-developed. This study seeks to understand how the use of framing and exemplification in works of journalism and suicide prevention campaigns are perceived by LGBTQ+ youth aged 18-24. By utilizing a combination of focus groups and in-depth interviews, the study sought to explore what human stories and campaigns were most resonant with the participants and why. The findings indicate that exemplification and framing can play a major role in how LGBTQ+ individuals perceive messages on suicide and suicide prevention. The study offers implications for journalists and communicators who are creating stories or campaigns about the topic.Includes bibliographical references",
