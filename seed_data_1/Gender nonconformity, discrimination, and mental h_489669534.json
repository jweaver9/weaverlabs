Cook et al. found that feminine men were notmore likely to be depressed despite the observation that theyweremore likely tobediscriminatedagainstand thatdiscrimina-tion increased the likelihood of depression. This is in contrast towhat studies among gay and bisexual men inWestern countrieshave consistently shown. In the current study, 196 Black SouthAfrican MSM (ages between 18 and 40; M age, 26.65 years)were surveyed. Assessments included stressors (identity confu-sion, internalized homophobia, and sexual orientation-baseddiscrimination) and resilience factors (openness about one’ssexual orientation, social support, and identification with thegaycommunity).Weobservedthatgender-nonconformingmenwerenotmore likely tobedepresseddespitehavingexperiencedmorediscrimination,whichwasassociatedwithdepression.Thesame relationships were observed when considering anxiety asthe mental health outcome.We found an indirect negative ef-fect of gender nonconformity on depression through internal-ized homophobia, suggesting that, in this population, internal-ized homophobia masks the effect of discrimination onmentaldistress. Implications for the sexualminority stressmodel, used toguide our analyses, are discussed. Further research is neededto disentangle the complex relationship between gender non-conformity and mental health amongMSM populations.Keywords Gender nonconformity \u0002Menwhohavesexwithmen \u0002Discrimination \u0002Mental health \u0002South Africa \u0002 Sexual orientationIntroductionStudies among gay and bisexual men inWestern countries haveconsistently shown that men who are gender nonconforming ordisplay feminine characteristics experiencemoremental distressthan gender-conforming men (D’Augelli, Grossman, & Starks,2006;Grossman,D’Augelli, Salter,&Hubbard, 2005;Henning-Stout, James, & Macintosh, 2000; Landolt, Bartholomew, Saf-frey, Oram, & Perlman, 2004; Ploderl & Fartacek, 2009; Sand-fort,Melendez,&Diaz,2007;Skidmore,Linsenmeier,&Bailey,2006). This elevatedmental distress has been attributed to higherlevels of discrimination experienced by gender-nonconforminggay and bisexual men, and studies have confirmed that discri-minationmediates the relationship betweengender expressionandmentaldistressinthispopulation(Baams,Beek,Hille,Zeven-bergen,&Bos, 2013; Sandfort et al., 2007; Toomey,Ryan,Diaz,Card, & Russell, 2010).InaLettertotheEditorofthis journal,Cook,Sandfort,Nel,andRich (2013) reported findings from a study among Black SouthAfrican men who have sex with men (MSM) that contradicted& Theo SandfortTgs2001@columbia.edu1 DivisionofGender, Sexuality andHealth,ColumbiaUniversityandNewYorkStatePsychiatric Institute, 1051RiversideDrive,Unit 15, New York, NY 10032, USA2 Department of Education, University of Amsterdam,Amsterdam, The Netherlands3 Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University,New York, NY, USA4 Human and Social Development, Human Sciences ResearchCouncil, Pretoria, South Africa5 University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa123Arch Sex Behav (2016) 45:661–670DOI 10.1007/s10508-015-0565-6these observations.Cooket al. found that gender-nonconformingmensufferedhigher levelsofdiscrimination,bothwhile inschoolas well as in life more generally, relative to gender-conformingmen; furthermore, both forms of discrimination were positivelyassociated with mental distress. Despite these associations, gen-der-nonconforming men did not have more mental distress thangender-conforming men. The assumption that the effect of dis-criminationonmentaldistresswasbufferedbyagreateropennessabout one’s sexuality and stronger identification with the gaycommunity—both positively associated with gender noncon-formity—seemed not to be supported by their data. These find-ings suggest that the relationship between gender nonconformityandmentaldistressamonggayandbisexualmenismorecomplexthanoften assumed. In this article,we aimed to ascertainwhetherthe findings reported by Cook et al. could be replicated among adifferent sample ofBlack SouthAfricanMSMand exploremorein-depth howgender nonconformity and health are related in thispopulation.Mostof thecurrent researchaboutmentalhealthamongMSMhasbeenguidedby the sexualminority stressmodel (SMSM)(Meyer, 1995, 2003). Sexual minority stress is the additional str-ess that gay, lesbian, and bisexual persons experience as a con-sequence of being amember of a sexualminority. Themodel po-sits that this additional stress results from distal and proximalfactors.Distal factors includeobjective sexualorientation-relateddiscrimination or violence. Proximal factors include internalizedhomophobia (the internalization of negative societal attitudes to-wards same-sex sexuality) and concealment (hiding one’s stig-matized sexual orientation). An additional proximal stressor thathas thusfarreceivedlittleattentioninscholarlyresearchbutmightalso negatively affect health outcomes is identity confusion (un-certaintyaboutone’ssexualorientation)(Mohr&Fassinger,2006;Willoughby, Doty, &Malik, 2010).Additional to these stressors, there are resilience factors thatmight either be directly related tomental health outcomes ormoderate the effects of stressors onmental health. These factorsincludesocial supportandidentificationwith thegayandlesbiancommunity.Somestressors, if conceptualized inreverse,canalsobe considered resilience factors; for instance, openness aboutone’ssexualorientation, theoppositeofconcealment,canhaveapositive effect on mental health. There is substantial evidencethat thesestressorsandresiliencefactorsaffect thementalhealthof sexualminoritypersons (Feinstein,Goldfried,&Davila,2012;Kosciw, Palmer, &Kull, 2014; Kwon, 2013; Newcomb&Mus-tanski,2010).TheSMSMhasbeenobservedtobevalidoutsideoftheWestern context (Dunn, Gonzalez, Costa, & Nardi, 2014).The SMSM has been adapted to understand the impact ofgender nonconformity onmental health. Logie, Newman, Chak-rapani, and Shunmugam (2012) did so for the comprehensivecategoryofMSMinSouth India, andHendricksandTesta (2012)forpersonswhoare transgenderandgendernonconformingin theU.S. In these adaptations, gender nonconformity is understood tounderlie and exacerbate the negative impact of sexual stigma. Intheir study, Logie et al. showed that gender nonconformity stig-ma–distal and proximal stress experienced for displaying femi-nine behavior–affected mental health negatively.Informed by the adapted SMSM and these other findings, wedeveloped the followingstrategy to test the relationshipsbetweengender nonconformity, sexual minority stressors and resiliencefactors,andmentalhealthamongBlackSouthAfricanMSM.Wefirstwantedtotestwhether,asinmostotherstudies, therewasadi-rect negative effect of gender nonconformity on mental distress.Second, we tested if sexual minority stressors and resiliencefactors were associated with gender nonconformity as well aswithmentaldistress.Asstressors,weincludedsexual identitycon-fusion, internalized homophobia, and sexual orientation-baseddiscrimination, both current andwhile growingup.Weexpecteddiscrimination to be positively associated with gender noncon-formity but we had no specific hypotheses about how the otherstressors related to gender nonconformity; rather, we expectedstressors tonegativelyaffectmentalhealth.Aspotential resiliencefactors, we included openness about one’s sexual orientation, so-cial support, and identification with the gay community.We hadno specific expectations about the direction of the associations oftheseresiliencefactorswithgendernonconformity,butwedidhy-pothesize that theywere positively associatedwithmental health.Third,weexploredwhether theeffectofgendernonconformityonmental distresswas contingent upon the levels of sexualminoritystressandresilience;weexpectedthatthenegativeeffectofgendernonconformity would be stronger for men who reported experi-enceswith the sexualminority stressors, andwould be less strongfor those who reported high scores on the resilience factors. Fi-nally, we explored whether there were indirect effects of gendernonconformity through the sexual minority stressors and resili-ence factors on mental distress. In particular, we expected thattherewouldbeanindirecteffectofgendernonconformitythroughopenness and gay community identification on mental health.Cook et al. (2013) found that both resilience factors were posi-tively associated with gender nonconformity.To test our expectations,weuseddata froma studyaboutHIVrisk among Black South African MSM (Knox, Reddy, Kaigho-badi, Nel, &Sandfort, 2012;Knox, Sandfort, Yi, Reddy,&Mai-mane, 2011; Sandfort, Nel, Rich, Reddy, & Yi, 2008; Sandfort,Yi,Knox,&Reddy,2013).Thedataallowedus to replicateCooket al.’s research question, and exploremore comprehensively therelationship between gender nonconformity andmental health inthe same population using a different sample.Although it was not the aim of this article to study its implica-tions, it is important to note that the situation regarding same-sexsexuality inSouthAfricadiffers in severalways fromthat inmostWestern countries.Until the endof apartheid, same-sex sexualityinSouthAfricawasillegal.However, thenewSouthAfricanCon-stitution, drafted in 1994, included non-discrimination and pro-tectionbasedonsexualorientation (Cock,2003;Hoad,Martin,&Reid, 2005). Despite this legal protection, same-sex sexuality re-mainshighlystigmatized.AsinotherAfricancountries, thesocial662 Arch Sex Behav (2016) 45:661–670123acceptance of same-sex sexuality in South Africa is among thelowest in the world (Kohut, 2013; Reid, 2010). Another distin-guishing factor is the centrality of gender in the expression ofsame-sexsexuality,whichappears to reproduce thebinarynotionof masculinity and femininity, much more so than in developedcountries.Display of feminine behaviors and participation in tradi-tionally feminineoccupationsare characteristic for a large segmentof the Black gay population in South Africa (Murray & Roscoe,2001; Rabie&Lesch, 2009; Reid, 2005, 2013; Swarr, 2004).MethodParticipantsAtotalof199BlackSouthAfricanMSMweresurveyed.Themenrangedinagefrom18to40yearsold; themeanagewas26.7years(SD=5.83). Seventy-nine (n=151) percent of the participantslived in a township.Two-thirds (n=122) of the participantswereinanongoingintimaterelationshipwithaman,and38.5%wereinthisrelationshipformore than1year.Mostmen(63.8%,n=126)were employed. Twenty-nine percent of the participants (n=58)had no income and one-third (34.2%, n=68) had a low income(i.e., 4500 South African Rand or less per month). Sixty-eightpercent (n=134) of the participants reported that they were reli-gious.Most participants reported feeling (only) sexually attractedtomen,basedonanaveragescoreof4.59(SD=0.68)onaninstru-ment that assessed sexual orientation (absolute range: 1–5).Participant recruitment and data collection were conductedfromOctober toDecember 2008.The study’s aimwas to recruit aheterogeneoussampleofBlackSouthAfricanMSMbasedonage(MSM above and below 25years of age) and residential status(MSM living in townships and those not living in townships).Townships in SouthAfrica are areas that are relatively under-resourced with high levels of unemployment, poverty, stigma,and low levels of education.As a result, there is hardly anyMSMcommunityorganization in these townships and there is noMSMcommercial subculture. In order to ensure diversity, multiple re-cruitmentstrategiesweredeployed.ForBlackmenliving in town-ships,socialfunctionswereheldinlocationsthroughoutthetown-ship.Blackmenlivingoutsideof townshipswere invited toattendsocialeventsatanLGBTcommunitycenter.Menwereeligible toparticipate in the study if they (1) lived in the greater Pretoriametropolitanarea;(2)werebetween18and40yearsold;(3)identi-fiedasBlackorAfrican;(4)reportedhavinghadoral,anal,ormas-turbatory sex with at least one man in the preceding year,regardless of involvement with women and including men whoself-identify as gay; and (5) were conversant in English.ProcedureInformedconsentwasobtainedverballybytheinterviewers.Onceconfirmed,allparticipantswereasked tofilloutaquestionnaireonthe spot. Privacywasmaintainedbyhavingparticipants completethe survey in quiet, usually adjacent rooms. Questionnaires wereadministeredusingComputer-AssistedSelf-Interviewing(CASI)in order to minimize social desirability bias. Four research assis-tantswere trained to obtain consent and to help participants begintheCASI. Participantswere compensated equal to approximately$8 USD for their time.The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Re-view Boards at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and theHuman Sciences Research Council (Pretoria, South Africa).MeasuresThesurveycollectedinformationonsociodemographiccharacter-istics, sexual orientation, gender expression,mental health, sexualminority stressors, and resilience factors. The sociodemographiccharacteristicsmeasured included age, residential status (living ina townshipor in thecity), educational attainment, income, andemployment status.Sexual OrientationThreeitemswereusedtoassesssexualorientation:(1)Doyoufeelmore sexually attracted to men or to women?

In thepresent studyCronbach’salphaforthis scale was .88.Gender NonconformityGender nonconformity was assessed by asking how participantsperceived themselves in termsofmasculinityandfemininity.Themasculinity/femininity (M/F) scale consisted of two items (‘‘Doyou see yourself as more masculine or more feminine than mostother men?’’ and ‘‘Do you think other people see you as moremasculine or more feminine than most other men?’’; 1=muchmoremasculine-5=muchmorefeminine;(Cronbach’salpha=.85).WeestablishedconstructvalidityforthisM/Fscalebytestingwhether there were differences on this scale for participants whopresented themselves to others as feminine, masculine or thosewho did not have a preference in their gender expression using aone-way analysis of variance. The analysis was significant, F(2,193)=414.29,p\\.001.Aposthoccomparison (LeastSignificantDifference) showed thatmenwho preferred to present themselvesto others in a feminine way had the highest M/F score (M=4.51,SD=0.42), and differed significantly frommen who preferred topresent themselves in a masculine way (M=1.98, SD=0.58)(p\\.0001) andmenwho reported no specific preference for gen-der expression (neutral gender expression) (M=3.21, SD=0.49)(p\\.0001).Menwith amasculinegender expression alsodifferedArch Sex Behav (2016) 45:661–670 663123significantly from men who reported a neutral gender expression(p\\.0001).Sexual Minority StressorsIn addition to discrimination while growing up and current dis-crimination, sexualminority stressors included sexual identityconfusionand internalizedhomophobia.Discriminationwhilegrowing up was measured using four items that questioned:‘‘Asyou were growing up, how often were you (1) made fun of orcalled names for being effeminate?; (2) hit or beaten up for beingeffeminate?; (3)madefunoforcallednamesforbeingattractedtoother men?; and (4) hit or beaten up for being attracted to othermen?’’(adapted fromDiaz,Ayala,Bein,Henne,&Marin, 2001).Response options ranged from 1=never to 4=many times, andCronbach’s alpha was .79.Discrimination in the past year was measured using a previ-ously validated scale adapted for this study (Herek&Berrill,1992).Participantswererequestedtoindicatethenumberoftimesin thepast year that theywereverbally insulted, physically threat-ened, had property damaged, objects thrown at them, been cha-sed, spat upon, punched, hit, kickedor beaten, assaulted, and sex-ually harassed because someone thought theywere homosexual.Sexual identity confusionwasmeasured using four items thatincluded:‘‘I’m not totally sure what my sexual orientation is,’’‘‘Ikeep changing my mind about my sexual orientation,’’‘‘I can’tdecidewhetherIambisexualorhomosexual,’’and‘‘Igetverycon-fusedwhen I try tofigure outmy sexual orientation’’(Cronbach’salpha= .89) (adapted fromMohr & Fassinger, 2000). Responseoptions ranged from1=disagree strongly to 6=agree strongly.Internalized homophobia was measured using a previouslyvalidated 10-item scale (adapted fromMohr&Fassinger, 2006).Sample items include: ‘‘Sometimes I dislike myself for being amanwho has sexwith other men’’,‘‘I have tried to becomemoresexually attracted to women’’, and ‘‘I wish I were only sexuallyattracted towomen’’(Cronbach’s alpha= .72).Responseoptionsranged from 1=disagree strongly to 6=agree strongly.Resilience FactorsOpennessaboutone’ssexualorientation,gaycommunityidentifi-cation,andsocialsupportwereassessedaspotential resiliencefac-tors. Openness wasmeasured using two items that asked howmanyofthefollowingpeopleknewthatonewassexuallyattractedtomen:currentheterosexualfriendsandcasualacquaintanceswhoare heterosexual (Cronbach’s alpha= .91). Response options ran-ged from 1=none of them to 5=all of them.Gay community identification wasmeasured with a scale de-velopedbyVanable,McKirnan, andStokes (1998). The scale in-cludes three statements (e.g., ‘‘It is very important to me that atleast some of my friends are bisexual or gay’’); participants wereaskedtoindicate theextent towhichtheyagreedordisagreedwitheach statement. Response options ranged from 1= disagreestrongly to 5=agree strongly. Cronbach’s alpha was .72.Social support was measured using five items that askedhowtrue itwas that there is someone that thepersoncan relyonformoney, food, a place to stay, to talk to if hehas problems, toaccompanyhim to the doctor, or helphim if hegetshurt (Cron-bach’s alpha= .86) (Dandona et al., 2005). Response optionsranged from 1= always to 5= never (total mean scores werereversed).Mental Health OutcomesThese included depression and anxiety, measured with two sub-scalesoftheDepressionAnxietyStressScales(Lovibond&Lovi-bond, 1995). TheDepression andAnxiety subscales each includ-ed seven items. Men were asked questions about how they feltover the past week, such as: ‘‘I felt that life was meaningless’’(depression) and‘‘Iwasworried about situations inwhich Imightpanic and make a fool of myself’’ (anxiety). Response optionsranged from 1=not at all to 3= very much or most of the time.Cronbach’s alpha for the subscales was .88 (depression) and .83(anxiety).AnalysesPearson rcorrelationswere conducted to investigate thebivariateassociationsbetween the independent (gendernonconformity)and dependent variables (depression and anxiety), risk factors(sexual identityconfusion, internalizedhomophobia,discrimi-nation when growing up and during past year), and resiliencefactors (openness, social support and gay community identifica-tion).A set of hierarchical analyses were conducted to examinewhether there was an effect of an interaction between gendernonconformity and the studied risk and resilience factors ondepression and anxiety. Analyses were conducted separatelyfordepressionandanxiety.Gendernonconformitywas includedasStep1ofboth regression analyses and the risk and resiliencefactors in Step 2. In Step 3, we added the interaction betweengender nonconformity and each stress and resilience factor tothe equation.To investigate whether there was an indirect effect of gendernonconformity and depression and anxiety through the studiedstressandresiliencefactorsbootstrappedmediationanalyseswereconductedthroughtheProcessmacrodevelopedbyHayes(2013).This analysis was done separately for depression and anxiety asdependentvariables. Inbootstrapping, randomsamplesaregener-ated based on the original data. In the current analysis, the boot-strappingwasdonewith10,000resamples.Foreachrandomsam-ple, the indirect effects were computed. The distribution of theseeffectswas then used to obtain 95%confidence intervals (CI) forthe size of indirect effects of the studied stress and resilience fac-torsontherelationbetweengendernonconformityanddepression664 Arch Sex Behav (2016) 45:661–670123andanxiety.The indirect effect for a stress and/or resilience factoris significant when the obtained CI does not contain the value 0.UsingbootstrappingCI reducespowerproblems thatmight occurbyasymmetricdistributionofanindirecteffect(MacKinnon,Lock-wood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002).ResultsBivariate Associations Between GenderNonconformity and Mental Health, Sexual MinorityStressors, and Resilience FactorsTherewas no significant associationbetweengender noncon-formity and themental health outcomes of depression and an-xiety (Table 1). Gender nonconformity, however, was asso-ciated with higher levels of experiences of discrimination duringchildhood and in the precedingyear, but alsowith lower levels ofsexual identity confusion and internalized homophobia (sex-ualminority stressors).Gendernonconformitywasalso related toopenness and gay community identification (resilience factors),withgender-nonconformingmenbeingmoreopenandidentifyingmore stronglywith the gay community.Gender nonconformitywas not associated with social support.Moststressorsweresignificantlycorrelatedwithdepression(with the exception of discrimination while growing up) andanxiety (with the exception of sexual identity confusion).Menwhoexperienced sexual identity confusionweremore likely tohave feelings of depression. Men who reported more discri-mination in the preceding years and had higher levels of inter-nalized homophobia had more feelings of depression and an-xiety.Somestressorsweresignificantlyassociatedwithoneanother:menwith stronger identity confusion also hadhigher levels ofinternalizedhomophobia;menwhohadexperiencedmoredis-crimination while growing up also reported more discrimina-tion in the preceding year. Discrimination in the precedingyearwas, however, not significantly relatedwith sexual identityconfusion and internalized homophobia, while men who hadexperienced more discrimination while growing up experi-enced less identity confusion and internalized homophobia.None of the resilience factorswere associatedwith thementalhealthoutcomesnorwere theyassociatedwithoneanother.Therewas, however, a marginally significant trend for the negative as-sociationbetweenopennessanddepression;menwhoreported tobe less open had higher levels of depression.Stressors and Resilience Factors as ModeratorsTable2 shows the results of the hierarchical regression analyseswith the gender nonconformity (Step 1), stressors and resiliencefactors (Step2),and the interactionofgendernonconformitywiththestressorsandresiliencefactors(Step3)regressedonbothmen-tal health outcomes (depression and anxiety). R-square’s for de-pressionandanxietywerenotsignificantinStep1andinclusionofthestressorsandresiliencefactors inStep2producedasignificantchange (KR2) in the coefficient of determination for depressionand anxiety. The interaction terms in Step 3 did not produce sig-nificantchanges(KR2s)for thementalhealthvariables, indicatingthat minority stressors or resilience factors did not moderate theassociation between gender nonconformity and mental health.As shown in Table2, sexual identity confusion and internal-ized homophobiawere both significantly related to depression inModel 2. Fisher’s z test showed that the beta’s for sexual identityconfusion and internalized homophobia on depression did notdiffer significantly (Fisher z=0.81). For anxiety, we only foundthree marginally significant trends. Men with more internalizedhomophobia, stronger gay community identification, and discri-mination in the precedingyear reportedmore anxiety (.10\\p[.05), while men with had less anxiety. The beta’s for internal-ized homophobia, discrimination in the preceding year, and gaycommunity identification did not differ significantly (Fisher z=-0.34\\Fisher z=0.34).Indirect Effect of Gender Nonconformity on MentalHealth through Stressors and Resilience FactorsTheindirecteffectsofthestressorsandresiliencefactorsondepre-ssionandanxietywere testedusingHayes’bootstrappedanalysesby PROCESS for assessing indirect pathways for multiple vari-ables. In thebootstrappedanalyses,we foundan indirect effect ofgender nonconformity on depression for the stressor internalizedhomophobia (95% CI -.08; -.02). The bootstrapping CIs in-cluded a zero for the other stressors and resilience factors (seeTable3), indicating that therewasnosupport foran indirecteffectof gender nonconformity through openness and gay communityidentification on depression as we had predicted and also notthrough sexual identity confusion, discrimination while growingup,discriminationintheprecedingyear,andsocialsupport.Therewas no indirect effect of gender nonconformity through the stres-sors and resilience factorsonanxiety (seeTable3).The total indi-rect effects for depression and anxiety were not significant in thebootstrapping analyses.DiscussionOur study amongBlackSouthAfricanMSMreplicated themainfindings fromCook et al. (2013):while discrimination in the pre-ceding year was associated with depression, and gender-non-conformingmenhadexperiencedmorediscrimination,gendernonconformitywas not directly associatedwith depression, a rel-ationship thatwould logically follow.Thesameapplies if anxietyis considered as the mental health outcome. This confirms Cooket al.’s findings that discrimination does not seem tomediate theArch Sex Behav (2016) 45:661–670 665123relationship between gender nonconformity and mental distressamong Black South African MSM. We also found that the as-sociation between gender nonconformity and mental health didnot vary in relation to levels of minority stressors or resiliencefactors.Overall, these findings suggest that the association betweengender nonconformity andmental distress among gay and bisex-ual men is more complex than generally assumed. This conclu-sion is strengthenedby the fact thatmanyvariables utilized inourstudy, includinggendernonconformity,wereoperationalizeddif-ferently than in the study byCook et al. (2013). Furthermore, weincludedmore variables in this study and tested the relationshipsmorewidely.Wealsodidnotfindsupport forourexpectation thatthe negative association of gender nonconformity with mentaldistresswouldbestronger formenwhoreportedexperienceswiththe sexual minority stressors, and would be less strong for thosewho reported higher scores on the resilience factors.Our study presents some additional findings that help to elu-cidate therelationshipbetweengendernonconformityandmentalhealth among Black South AfricanMSM.We found an indirecteffectofgendernonconformityondepressionthroughthestressorinternalized homophobia. This finding suggests that gender non-conformity leads to less internalizedhomophobia,which, in turn,leads to less depression. In this sample, internalized homophobiaappeared tomask the effect of discrimination onmental distress.Wedidnotfindsupport forour expectation that therewasan indi-rect effect of gender nonconformity through openness and gaycommunity identification—thefactors thatCooketal. (2013)hadfoundtobepositivelyassociatedwithgendernonconformity—onmental health. Also contrary to our findings, resilience factorswere not associated withmental health; mental health seemed tobe exclusively determined by sexual minority stressors, in par-ticular internalized homophobia and current sexual orientation-based discrimination.Thepositiveassociationbetweeninternalizedhomophobiaanddepression has been found in several studies (Newcomb&Mus-tanski, 2010). But how do we understand that gender noncon-formity leads to less internalized homophobia? A possible expla-nation is that the disproportionate discrimination that gender-nonconforming men experience while they are growing upforces them to come to termswith their homosexuality, whilesexual identity development for men who do not stand out interms of their gender is more uneven and discordant. Anotherpossible explanation is related to the gendered-way that homo-sexuality is understood among Black persons in South Africa: adominant conception of male homosexuality is that it is stronglyassociatedwith femininity (Reid,2005).RabieandLesch (2009),for instance, discussed how itwas normal for gayBlackmen in aSouth African township to visit with the females in the commu-nityandparticipateintraditionallyfemaleactivities. It isalmostasif, in the South African system of hegemonic masculinity, iden-tificationwith femininity facilitates the expression of a gay iden-tity. If femininity is indeedexperiencedastheonlylegitimatewayinwhichhomosexualitycanbeexpressed,gender-nonconform-ingmenmayfind it easier toaccept theirhomosexualdesires thanmenwhobybeingmasculinedeviatefromwhattheirenvironmentexpects from them.Discriminationmight strengthen this effect aswell: the discrimination that gender nonconformingmenundergowhilegrowingupcouldbeexperiencedasagroup-basedrejection,resulting in a nurturing and embracing of the identity that is re-sponsible for their exclusion, which subsequently bolsters well-being(Branscombe,Schmitt,&Harvey,1999;Jetten,Branscombe,Schmitt,&Spears, 2001).Menwhoaregender-conformingmightbe less inclined to see themselves as part of a group.Table 1 Pearson r correlations between gender nonconformity, stressors and resilience factors, and mental health outcomes (means and SDs)1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.

In a social climate where rejection ofsame-sex sexuality is strong, passingmight also be a safer optionthan comingout. It is possible, however, that not comingoutprecludes men from processing negative feelings that stem fromengaginginstigmatizedbehavior—beingattractedtomembersofthesamesex—andthis results inthemprocessingstrongerfeelingsTable 2 Hierarchical regression for depression and anxietyStep 1 Step 2 Step 3B SE b p B SE b p B SE b pDepressionGender nonconformity (GNC) -.01 .04 -.03 ns .02 .04 .05 ns .02 .04 .04 nsSexual identity confusion .08 .03 .18 .021 .08 .04 .18 .033Internalized homophobia .14 .04 .27 .002 .14 .05 .28 .003Discrimination growing up .09 .06 .12 .ns .07 .06 .09 nsDiscrimination past year .03 .02 .12 ns .03 .02 .10 nsOpenness -.04 .03 -.09 ns -.03 .03 -.08 nsSocial support .06 .04 .10 ns .07 .05 .12 nsGay community identification .03 .04 .06 ns .05 .04 .09 nsGNC9Sexual identity confusion .02 .03 .06 nsGNC9 Internalized homophobia .01 .04 .02 nsGNC9Discrimination growing up .04 .05 .06 nsGNC9Discrimination past year -.01 .02 -.03 nsGNC9Openness -.03 .03 -.08 nsGNC9Social support -.01 .04 -.02 nsGNC9Gay community identification -.02 .03 -.07 nsR2 0.00 0.17*** 0.19**F 0.12 4.62*** 2.68**KR2 0.00 0.17*** 0.02**KF 0.12 5.26*** 0.56**AnxietyGender nonconformity (GNC) -.01 .04 -.01 ns .00 .04 -.00 ns .00 .04 .00 nsSexual identity confusion .03 .03 .07 ns .03 .04 .07 nsInternalized homophobia .09 .04 .18 ns .08 .05 .17 nsDiscrimination growing up .07 .06 .11 ns .08 .06 .12 nsDiscrimination past year .03 .02 .14 ns .03 .02 .14 nsOpenness -.04 .03 -.09 ns -.04 .03 -.11 nsSocial support -.01 .04 -.02 ns .01 .05 .01 nsGay community identification .08 .04 .15 ns .07 .04 .15 nsGNC9Sexual identity confusion .02 .03 .07 nsGNC9 Internalized homophobia -.05 .04 -.11 nsGNC9Discrimination growing up -.01 .05 -.01 nsGNC9Discrimination past year -.01 .02 -.06 nsGNC9Openness -.04 .03 -.12 nsGNC9Social support -.04 .04 -.07 nsGNC9Gay community identification .00 .03 -.01 nsR2 .00 0.11** .14F 0.04 2.81** 1.86*KR2 .00 0.11** .03KF .04 3.20** .81*** p\\.001; ** p\\.01; * p\\.05Arch Sex Behav (2016) 45:661–670 667123of internalizedhomophobia.Analternativeexplanationcouldbe that internalized homophobia prevents men from coming out(Weber-Gilmore, Rose, & Rubinstein, 2011).DoMSMwithvaryinggender expressionhavedifferent com-ing out processes and trajectories? It is important to indicate thatgender nonconformity during childhood was not assessed in thisstudy.However, thefinding thatgender-nonconformingmenhadexperiencedmore discriminationwhile growing up suggests thattheyhaveaqualitativelydifferent trajectoryof sexual identityde-velopment. Ifmenwithvaryinggenderexpressionsalreadydifferwhile growing up, it is likely that their process of coming out isdifferent, elicitingdistinct social responses andenablingdifferentcopingstrategies.Childhoodgendernonconformity shouldbetaken into account in future research that attempts to further dis-entangle the complex relationship between gender nonconfor-mity andmental health in this population.Ourfindingshave implications for theSMSM.Firstofall, theysuggest that thismodelmight operatedifferently dependinguponthe social context.They also indicate the importanceof includinggender nonconformity as a critical factor in themodel. Our find-ingssuggest that thereare importantdifferencesin termsofsexualminority stressors and resilience factors in relation togendernon-conformity; for instance,whilediscriminationwasmore frequentfor gender-nonconforming MSM, identify confusion was lessstrongcompared togender-conformingMSM.Factors thatonewould assume induce stress—gender nonconformity—mightthrough developmental processes turn out to have positive con-sequences as well in the long-term. Finally, our findings suggestthe importance of differentiating between health outcomes. De-spite the strong correlation between depression and anxiety, de-pression was associated with more stress factors than anxiety. Itcouldbe thatdue to thecomparativelyhigh levelsof interpersonalviolence in South Africa (Mayosi et al., 2012), anxiety is moreaffectedbysocialfactorsthanindividualfactors,whiledepressionis more strongly shaped by individual factors than social factors.Our findings should be interpreted taking some limitationsinto account. First, this was a cross-sectional study, which limitsthe ability todrawcausal inferenceswith respect to time.Second,Table 3 Parallelmultiplemediation analyses examining indirect effects of gender nonconformity on depression and anxiety via stress and resiliencefactors95% confidence intervalB SE Lower UpperDepressionDirect effect .02 .04 -.05 .10Indirect effect viaSexual identity confusion -.01 .01 -.04 .00Internalized homophobia -.04** .02* -.08* -.02*Discrimination growing up .02 .02 -.01 .06Discrimination past year .01 .01 .00 .04Openness -.02 .02 -.05 .01Social support .00 .01 -.01 .01Gay community identification .01 .01 .00 .03Total -.05 .03 -.11 .00AnxietyDirect effect .00 .04 -.08 .08Indirect effect viaSexual identity confusion .00 .01 -.02 .00Internalized homophobia -.03 .02 -.07 .00Discrimination growing up .02 .02 -.01 .05Discrimination past year .01 .01 -.01 .04Openness -.02 .02 -.05 .02Social support .00 .00 -.01 .01Gay community identification .01 .01 .00 .04Total -.01 .02 -.05 .04Sexual identityconfusion, internalizedhomophobia,discriminationwhilegrowingup,andnumberofexperienceswithdiscrimination in theprecedingyear.

In terms of our gender nonconformityassessment, this implies for instance that it is not knownwhethergender nonconforming men are actually perceived as such byother persons, which might be crucial in terms of the consequ-ences of gender nonconformity.In conclusion, our study confirms findings reported by Cooket al. (2013) that, amongBlackSouthAfricanMSM,gendernon-conformityappears toaffectmental healthdifferently than it doesamong gender nonconforming men in Western countries. Ourfindings also elicit several further questions. One is whether sex-ual identity development varies based on gender nonconformity;answering this question would require studying a cohort begin-ningatayoungerageandtofollowthemover time.Anotherques-tion is whether White South African gender nonconformingMSM are more similar to Black South African gender noncon-forming MSM or to MSM in Western countries, in which caseethniccultureandnotnationalculturewouldbeadeterminingfac-tor.Fromahistoricalperspective,onemightquestionwhethergen-der as a critical element of same-sex sexual expression in SouthAfrican MSM is an enduring factor or a local remnant that as aconsequence of globalization will diminish in importance (Alt-man, 1996; Sutton, 2007).Acknowledgments The study was supported by a grant from amfAR(106973; Principal Investigator: Theo Sandfort, Ph.D.) with additionalsupport from a grant from the National Institute ofMental Health (R01-MH083557; Principal Investigator: Theo Sandfort, Ph.D.).

    "abstract": "Using data from a study about HIV risk among Black South African MSM, we aimed to ascertain whether unexpected findings about the relationship between gender nonconformity, discrimination, and mental health in this population, as reported by Cook, Sandfort, Nel, and Rich (2013), could be replicated, and to explore more in-depth how gender nonconformity relates to health. Cook et al. found that feminine men were not more likely to be depressed despite the observation that they were more likely to be discriminated against and that discrimination increased the likelihood of depression. This is in contrast to what studies among gay and bisexual men in Western countries have consistently shown. In the current study, 196 Black South African MSM (ages between 18 and 40; M age, 26.65 years) were surveyed. Assessments included stressors (identity confusion, internalized homophobia, and sexual orientation-based discrimination) and resilience factors (openness about one’s sexual orientation, social support, and identification with the gay community). We observed that gender-nonconforming men were not more likely to be depressed despite having experienced more discrimination, which was associated with depression. The same relationships were observed when considering anxiety as the mental health outcome. We found an indirect negative effect of gender nonconformity on depression through internalized homophobia, suggesting that, in this population, internalized homophobia masks the effect of discrimination on mental distress. Implications for the sexual minority stress model, used to guide our analyses, are discussed. Further research is needed to disentangle the complex relationship between gender nonconformity and mental health among MSM populations",
