A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE1INTRODUCTIONIn 2014, the Open Society Foundations produced License to be Yourself,  a report on progressive gender recognition laws and policies for trans people,  as well as the activist strategies behind them.1 This brief is one of four complementary resources for activists that summarize and address some of the key arguments made by those who oppose access to legal gender recognition. This brief focuses on legal gender recognition restrictions that affect married people. It provides counter-arguments that can be used by those advocating for rights-based gender recognition laws and policies. Although this brief is written from a trans perspective, many of the issues it describes are relevant to people with intersex variations. In addition, it includes some\tspecific\tinformation\tabout\thow\tpeople\twith\tintersex\tvariations\tare\taffected\tby gender recognition laws that exclude people who are married. A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE2OVERVIEWThe\tvast\tmajority\tof\ttrans\tpeople\taround\tthe\tworld\tcannot\tobtain\tofficial\tdocuments\tunder their appropriate name and sex matching their gender identity. Trans people risk discrimination when they are required to verify their identity using documents that do not match.\tAs\tidentification\tis\trequired\tfor\tmost\tactivities\tin\tdaily\tlife,\tinappropriate\tdocuments\tcan result in trans people being denied vital housing, health services, or a job.Where gender recognition laws and policies exist, they often exclude people who are married. This forces trans people to choose between legal recognition of their gender identity or their marriage. Such requirements amount to forced divorce. They violate trans people’s rights to privacy, to marriage, and to recognition before the law. Forced divorce requirements also impact on trans people’s partners and children. A marriage that has stayed strong through one partner’s transition should be celebrated, not dissolved. The emotional costs, on all family members, of a forced divorce should not\tbe\tunder-estimated.\tIn\taddition,\tthere\tare\tfrequently\tfinancial\timplications\twhen\tspousal\tbenefits\tcome\tto\tan\tend,\ton\ttop\tof\tthe\tactual\tcosts\tof\ta\tdivorce.\tSpousal\tbenefits\tmay\tbe\tnot\tavailable\tto\tde\tfacto\tcouples\tor\tonly\ton\tless\tfavourable\tterms.\tBeyond\tthe\tfinancial\tloss,\tthe\timpact\tof\tdivorce\tcan\tbe\tdestabilizing,\tparticularly\twhen\ta spouse’s immigration visa is based on marital status. Even\twhen\ttrans\tpeople\tare\table\tto\tchange\ttheir\tname\tand\tgender\tmarker\ton\tofficial\tdocuments, this does not automatically mean they will be allowed to marry as that sex.\tIn\tplaces\twhere\tmarriage\tis\tdefined\tas\tbeing\tsolely\tbetween\tone\twoman\tand\tone man, laws and policies frequently place higher thresholds before a trans person is legally recognized as male or female for this purpose. These often require evidence of permanent\tsterilization\tand\tgender\taffirming\tsurgeries.\tTrans people should never have to choose between the dignity, equality, and safety that come with legal gender recognition, or the ability to marry or stay married to their partner. TERMINOLOGY AND SCOPEThis document uses the umbrella term trans to describe people whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. It includes, for example, gender variant and gender nonconforming people, those who identify as transgender or transsexual, and trans women who simply identify as female and trans men who identify as male. Trans is also used here to encompass terms that have developed and are best understood\twithin\ttheir\tspecific\tcultural\tcontext.\tThese\tinclude,\tfa’afafine / fa’atama (Samoa), travesti (Central and South America), meme (Namibia), hijra (India), meti (Nepal), kathoey (Thailand) and transpinay / transpinoy / in the Philippines. Gender Identity refers to the way an individual perceives their own gender. Gender expression refers to how a person manifests or displays their gender identity and/or how this is perceived by others. For example, this may be seen in choices that a person makes about their clothes, voice, hairstyle, facial hair, use of makeup, or mannerisms. Biological sex characteristics refer to a range of biological features including chromosomes, hormones, reproductive capacity and external genitalia. Not everyone is\tborn\twith\tsex\tcharacteristics\tthat\tfit\tneatly\tinto\tjust\ttwo\tbinary\tcategories,\teither\ttotally ‘male’ or totally ‘female’. Even when trans people are able to change their name and gender marker on official documents, this does not automatically mean they  will be allowed to marry as  that sex.A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE3The terms sex and gender are used inconsistently both within and between countries. They are considered to be identical terms in some legal systems or languages. In this document the distinction being made is between someone’s assigned or recorded sex at\tbirth\tand\ttheir\taffirmed\tor\tpreferred\tgender.2 The term intersex refers to people born with variations in physical sex characteristics (such\tas\tchromosomes,\tgonads\tor\tgenitals).\tIntersex\tbodies\tdo\tnot\tfit\ttypical\tdefinitions\tof male or female. There is a diversity of intersex bodies, identities and experiences. Some people with intersex variations may describe their sex or gender identity in non-binary terms, but most are male or female.The term legal gender recognition describes how countries recognize a person’s gender identity. The main focus of these four Open Society briefs is how countries’ laws and policies enable someone’s sex details (or gender marker) to be amended to match their gender identity. The most obvious gender markers are binary categories such as male/female or Mr./Mrs./Ms./Miss. Less obvious binary gender markers include coded numbers which differentiate between males and females. USING THIS RESOURCEThis brief primarily supports people advocating for progressive gender recognition laws and policies. It untangles the stereotypes and misinformation behind many of the challenges to such proposals. Where valid concerns are raised, it suggests ways to balance different perspectives and rights in a way that upholds each person’s dignity. This requires understanding the real impact current laws and policies have on people’s lives. Some\targuments\twill\tcarry\tmore\tweight\tthan\tothers\twithin\tspecific\tcommunities.\tHopefully, spelling them out will enable people to make strategic decisions about how best to advocate for change. MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE FOR INTERSEX PEOPLEThis\tsection\tidentifies\tthe\tspecific\tlegal\tgender\trecognition\tissues\tintersex\tpeople\tface\tthat affect their right to marry. It is deliberately placed near the front of this resource to encourage discussion about how progressive gender recognition laws can meet the needs of both trans and intersex people. Being intersex is a different experience from being trans. Therefore it is important that intersex-led organisations are involved in developing gender recognition reforms.One of the demands of the Third International Intersex Forum, held in Malta in 2013, was “to ensure the provision of all human rights and citizenship rights to intersex people, including the right to marry and form a family.”3 Forced sterilization of intersex people obviously affects their right to form a family. It is discussed in the separate resource in this series about reproductive autonomy.In some countries such as Thailand, where trans people cannot amend sex details on birth registration records, the option to do so is available for intersex people who have undergone genital surgery.4 Typically these surgeries will have been performed on intersex infants and children without their consent. Such amendments to birth records invariably obscure a child’s history, particularly if no records are kept of medical and surgical interventions. Therefore it is appropriate to acknowledge the importance This brief primarily supports people advocating for progressive gender recognition laws and policies.A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE4Intersex people may face barriers that impact on their right to marry, even without amending their sex assigned at birth.of broader human rights violations against people with intersex variations, rather than focusing narrowly on legal gender recognition alone. For example, people with intersex variations should have access to this historical information about their own body, and the choice to decide who else is able to access such personal details.The\tsex\tdetails\tlisted\ton\tan\tintersex\tperson’s\tbirth\tcertificate\tand\tother\tofficial\tdocuments also impact on their right to marry. Intersex organizations have advocated that intersex infants should be registered as either female or male with the awareness that, like all people, they may grow up to identify with a different sex or gender.5 At that future point they should be able to choose from the full range of sex and or gender\toptions\ton\tofficial\tdocuments,\tincluding\tthose\toutside\tbinary\tmale\tand\tfemale\tclassifications.\tSometimes\tit\tis\tincorrectly\tassumed\tthat\tpeople\twith\tintersex\tvariations\tshould automatically be assigned a non-binary sex or gender. However, as the Open Society report Licence to be Yourself emphasizes, the decision to have one’s sex listed as a non-binary or third sex must be entirely voluntary for the individual concerned.If intersex people subsequently amend the sex they were assigned at birth, they typically face a range of barriers that impact on their right to marry. Like trans people, an intersex person may be denied the right to change these details unless they are single, and be forced to divorce if they are already married. In addition, intersex people may be excluded because laws are framed around the experiences of trans people, for example by requiring evidence of clinical treatment for gender transition.6 More progressive gender recognition laws enable those intersex people who wish to change their gender marker to do so, either based on their intersex status or as a universal right to self-determination. Intersex\tpeople\thave\tdifficulties\tmarrying\tor\tstaying\tmarried\teven\twhen\tthey\thave\tnot\tamended their sex assigned at birth. In some cases an intersex person’s marriage has been annulled because their body has been deemed not wholly one sex or another, or as unsatisfactory for heterosexual intercourse.7MARRIAGE FOR PEOPLE WITH NON-BINARY  IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTSMarriage equality laws that are framed around same-sex and opposite-sex couples, often do not apply to people who have documentation describing their sex as other than simply male or female. Some trans people and some people with intersex variations will be in this situation. Ideally marriage equality laws should recognize marriages of any two eligible people, irrespective of their sex.8 For example, amendments in 2013 to New Zealand’s\tMarriage\tAct\tclarified\tthat\ta\tmarriage\tis\tbetween two people regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity.9A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE5THE CURRENT SITUATIONIn countries that have recently introduced or updated gender recognition or marriage equality laws, there has been a significant shift towards respecting  trans people’s right to marry and to stay married.A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE6HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONSThe Yogyakarta Principles collate obligations under existing international human rights law, clarifying how these apply to human rights violations based on a person’s gender identity or sexual orientation. Principle 3 focuses on the right to recognition before the law:“ Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law… No status, such as marriage or parenthood, may be invoked as such to prevent the legal recognition of a person’s gender identity.”10In Europe, both the current and former Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights have spoken out against gender recognition provisions that force trans people to\tdivorce\ttheir\tspouses.\tIn\t2009,\tThomas\tHammarberg\tspecifically\trecommended\tthat member states “remove any restrictions on the right of trans persons to remain in an existing marriage following a recognised change of gender.”11 This was reiterated in\tNovember\t2012\tby\tCommissioner\tNils\tMuižnieks\twho\twrote\tto\tthe\tIrish\tminister\tof\tsocial protection urging that “divorce should not be a necessary condition for gender recognition as it can have a disproportionate effect on the right to family life.”12 In addition, Commissioner Hammarberg’s 2011 report recommended that member states “respect the right of transgender persons to effectively exercise their right to marry in accordance with their legally recognised gender.”13 CURRENT PROGRESSIVE LAWSIn Latin America, married people have been able to access gender recognition in Uruguay since 2009, and in Argentina since 2012.14 In 2014, Mexico City followed Argentina’s world-leading approach. It introduced a simple administrative process that provides universal access to gender recognition, including for those who are married.15 In North America, no state in the United States has a law requiring a trans person to be single or to divorce in order to obtain legal gender recognition. If someone in a legal marriage transitions and changes their gender marker, the marriage remains valid. This is true, even in states that do not recognize same-sex marriage.16 In Europe a growing number of countries no longer require trans people to end a valid marriage prior to changing their gender marker. These include, for example, Austria, Denmark, England, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales. 17In countries that have recently introduced or updated gender recognition or marriage equality\tlaws,\tthere\thas\tbeen\ta\tsignificant\tshift\ttowards\trespecting\ttrans\tpeople’s\tright\tto marry and to stay married. In New Zealand the\tMarriage\t(Definition\tof\tMarriage)\tAmendment Act 2013 repealed previous provisions prohibiting married people from changing\tsex\tdetails\ton\ta\tbirth\tcertificate.\tIn\tAustralia, married people can access the March 2014 changes to gender recognition laws in the Australia Capital Territory.18In England and Wales, the removal of forced divorce requirements, with the passage of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, was welcomed. However the new law was criticized for requiring trans people to obtain their spouse’s consent in order for\tthe\tmarriage\tto\tcontinue\tonce\ta\tgender\trecognition\tcertificate\thad\tbeen\tissued.\tSignificantly\tthe\tScottish\tParliament’s\tEqual\tOpportunities\tCommittee\tunanimously\t“ Everyone  has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.”A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE7removed this spousal veto from its equivalent Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014. Scotland’s national LGBTI organization, the Equality Network, consulted spouses of trans people on this issue. All supported removing a spousal veto and greatly objected to the notion that they should have control over such a fundamental aspect of their partner’s identity.19In Malta, the ground-breaking Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act was passed on April 1, 2015.20 Its provisions remove any requirement for a person to be single or to divorce in order to gain legal gender recognition. Instead it creates a quick, transparent gender recognition process based on self-determination.21The momentum continues to build. In October 2014, bills were introduced in three Australian states (New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania) to repeal current provisions that force married trans people to divorce in order to be eligible for legal gender recognition.22CASE LAWStrategic litigation has played a key part in bringing about many of these changes, including in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Sweden and through Constitutional Court decisions in both Austria and Germany. In a landmark 2002 decision, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) recognized that trans people who\thad\tundergone\tgender\taffirming\tsurgeries\thad\tthe\tright\tto\tmarry\tas\tthat\tsex\t(Goodwin and I v. United Kingdom). The 2006 Austrian decision acknowledged that Austria’s Civil Code reserves the right to marry to opposite sex couples but considered it was “inexplicable” that only an unmarried person could correct their entry in the register of births, deaths and marriages.23 In 2008, the German Constitutional Court emphasized the unfairness of requiring individuals to choose between two fundamental rights—personal self-determination and marriage.24It was only in 2012 that the ECtHR heard a case about a trans person’s right to stay married. The Court dismissed a complaint by a trans woman that the compulsory divorce requirement in Finnish law breached her rights under the Convention. The case was referred to the Grand Chamber, which came to the same decision in July 2014 (Hämäläinen v. Finland).25\tTo\ta\tsignificant\textent\tthis\twas\tbecause\tFinland enables a trans person’s marriage to be converted to “an almost identical” civil partnership. This still leaves the door open for applications to the ECtHR about forced divorce from trans people in countries where there is no civil partnership law or other alternative way for their relationships to be recognized. The freedom that the ECtHR affords individual countries to interpret their human rights obligations—known as the margin of appreciation—limits the extent to which it critically scrutinizes forced divorce requirements.26 However in Hämäläinen v. Finland, three dissenting judges critiqued the emphasis that decision put on the absence of consensus among Council of Europe Member States. These judges reiterated past criticism that such an approach allowed the “lowest common denominator” among member States to prevail. Instead they argued that the Court should have asked whether there was “clear and uncontested evidence of a continuing international trend,” as it had done in Goodwin and I v. United Kingdom. This would have given greater weight to case law overturning forced divorce requirements, such as the German Constitutional Court judgment. Strategic litigation has played a key part in bringing about many of these changes.A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE8The dissenting judges considered that the majority judgment had not given due weight to the emotional hardship that the dissolution of this marriage would cause the couple. Their religious beliefs meant they placed high value on being married, rather than in a registered partnership. Furthermore, the dissenting judges found that others’ rights and freedoms would in no way be affected if the trans applicant and her wife remained married, and nor would the institution of marriage be jeopardized. Similarly, five\tyears\tearlier\tCommissioner\tThomas\tHammarberg\thad\tstated\tthat\t“protecting\tall\tindividuals without exception from state-forced divorce has to be considered of higher importance than the very few instances in which this leads to same-sex marriages.”27 In Asia, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal’s May 2013 decision in W v The Registrar of Marriages allowed\ta\ttrans\twomen,\twho\thad\tundergone\tgender\taffirming\tsurgery, to marry her boyfriend.28 This decision reversed earlier rulings over the preceding\tfive\tyears.\tSubsequently\tthe\tHong\tKong\tgovernment\tintroduced\tthe\tMarriage Amendment Bill (MAB) 2014 to explicitly limit legal gender recognition, for the purpose of marriage, to trans people who had undergone sterilization and genital reconstruction. In October 2014, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong rejected this proposal.29In Taiwan, a marriage is only legally binding if one partner is a man and the other is a woman. In August 2013, the Taiwan Ministry of Interior overturned an earlier decision to annul the marriage of two trans women. The women married in 2012 when only one of them had amended her gender marker to female on her national identity card.\tThe\tmarriage\twas\tregistered\tbut\tthen\tinvalidated\tafter\tofficials\tdiscovered\tthe\tsecond trans women had subsequently changed her gender marker to female. After a lengthy public hearing and a closed-door meeting, the Ministry of Interior agreed to reinstate the couple’s marital status. This decision was based on a 1994 ruling in which the Ministry of Justice said a change of gender during a legally recognized marriage does not affect that person’s marital standing or relationship with their children. The marriage was valid because the two women were legally recognized as belonging to opposite genders at the time their marriage was registered.30“ Protecting all individuals without exception from state-forced divorce has to be considered of higher importance than the very few instances in which this leads to same-sex marriages.”A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE9SOME COMMON ARGUMENTS AND POSSIBLE RESPONSESArgument:  The number of trans people this affects is very small.Response:  The number is not insignificant and their rights  are no less valid.A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE10ARGUMENTS OPPOSING SAME-SEX MARRIAGESARGUMENT:  LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION FOR MARRIED PEOPLE CREATES A SAME-SEX MARRIAGE Allowing someone to stay married after changing their gender marker creates a same-sex marriage. In places where same-sex marriage is not available, trans and intersex people are asking for special privileges. There is no reason why they should have their relationship recognized when other people do not have that option. ARGUMENT:  MARRIAGE SHOULD BE  LIMITED TO COUPLES WHO ARE ABLE TO HAVE CHILDRENOne of the fundamental purposes of a marriage is to create a stable foundation for having and bringing up children. Trans or intersex people who are unable to have children naturally should not be eligible to marry.RESPONSE:  ENDING FORCED DIVORCE PROTECTS EXISTING  MARRIAGES AND FAMILIES•\t\tA\ttrans\tperson’s\tmarriage\tshould\thave\tthe\tsame\tlegal\tprotection\tas\tany\tother marriage.•\t\tIt\tis\tinappropriate\tand\thighly\tinsensitive\tfor\tthe\tlaw\tto\tdissolve\ta\tmarriage\tthat has remained strong after one partner transitions. •\t\tDecisions\tabout\twhether\tor\tnot\tto\tend\ta\tmarriage\tshould\tbe\tbased\tsolely\ton the wishes of the two people who are married. •\t\tAllowing\tthe\tstate\tto\tforce\tsuch\tcouples\tto\tdivorce\tundermines\ttheir\tright\tto family life. •\t\tThe\timportance\tof\tprotecting\texisting\tmarriages,\twithout\texception,\toutweighs concerns that a small proportion of marriages might now be considered same-sex marriages.RESPONSE:  MARRIAGE RECOGNIZES COUPLES WHETHER OR NOT THEY  ARE TRANS OR INTERSEX OR HAVE CHILDREN •\t\tThe\tlegal\tinstitution\tof\tmarriage\tis\tnot\ttied\tto\ta\tcouple’s\tability\tto\thave\tchildren.

RESPONSE:  A MARRIAGE IS VALID AT THE POINT WHEN TWO PEOPLE  ARE LEGALLY WED•\t\tThere\tare\tcountries\tand\tstates\twhere\tmarriage\tis\tdefined\tas\tbeing\tbetween a man and a woman yet they do not require forced divorce when one partner changes their legal gender marker.31•\t\tA\tperson\tis\trequired\tto\tmeet\tthe\tmarriage\teligibility\tcriteria\tat\tthe\tpoint\tat\twhich they marry.32 If a couple met the eligibility criteria at that point, any subsequent changes to the person’s circumstances (including their legal sex or gender) should not affect the legal status of the marriage. •\t\tTypically,\tlegal\tgender\trecognition\tdoes\tnot\tinvalidate\tother\texisting\tlegal arrangements. Therefore in countries where marriage is limited to opposite-sex couples, arguably “the couple remain in what is legally a heterosexual marriage as they were respectively male and female on the date of their marriage.”33 This point has been recognized in some countries including recently in Taiwan.•\t\tMarriage\tcarries\tspecific\tlegal\trights\tand\tresponsibilities\tthat\tdo\tnot\tchange simply because one spouse applies to change their gender marker on\tofficial\tdocuments.ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE IMPACTS ON CHILDREN OR A SPOUSE ARGUMENT:  ALLOWING A TRANS PARENT TO STAY MARRIED IS BAD FOR CHILDRENIt would be too hard for children if a parent transitions, changes their gender marker, and therefore becomes\tofficially\trecognized\tas\tbeing part of a same-sex couple.RESPONSE:  FORCING PARENTS TO DIVORCE NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THEIR CHILDREN•\t\tThere\tis\tno\tevidence\tthat\thaving\ttrans\tparents\tnegatively\timpacts\tchildren.34•\t\tA\trecent\tcourt\tdecision\tfrom\tUkraine, for example, declared it was illegal to exclude parents from access to legal gender recognition.

Forcing partners to divorce in those circumstances makes a mockery of the legal protection given to a marriage.ARGUMENTS THAT THIS IS A SMALL, INSIGNIFICANT ISSUE ARGUMENT:  THE NUMBER OF TRANS PEOPLE THIS AFFECTS IS VERY SMALL When a married person transitions, it is very unlikely that their spouse will want the marriage to continue. Trans people in this situation are likely to become divorced anyway and therefore eligible for legal gender recognition. So there is no need for legal gender recognition to be extended to people who are married. RESPONSE:  THE NUMBER IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT AND THEIR RIGHTS  ARE NO LESS VALID •\t\tIt\tis\thard\tto\tknow\tthe\tnumber\tof\tmarried\tpeople\tin\tthis\tsituation.\tThis\tis\tpartly because current policies tend to make married trans people invisible by requiring a trans person to choose between their gender identity and their marital status. •\t\tEven\tif\tthe\tcurrent\tnumber\tof\tmarried\ttrans\tpeople\twere\tsmall,\tthe\tright\tto\tlegal gender recognition should not be dependent on forfeiting other rights.•\t\tThis\tissue\thas\temerged\tin\tmany\tdifferent\tcountries\tand\tcultural\tcontexts,\tsuggesting\tthe\tnumber\tof\ttrans\tpeople\twho\tare\tmarried\tis\tnot\tinsignificant\tand that this a priority for them and their partners.

Current or proposed laws should be future-proofed to meet this potential growth in demand.A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE13ARGUMENT:  A MARRIAGE SHOULD BE  MORE IMPORTANT THAN  A PIECE OF PAPER Married people sometimes have to put their relationship ahead of their\tindividual\twishes.\tIt\tis\tselfish\tfor a married trans person to give more value to their personal legal status than to their marriage.ARGUMENT:  A CIVIL OR REGISTERED PARTNERSHIP IS JUST AS GOOD AS A MARRIAGEWhere same-sex couples are able to enter into a civil or registered partnership, forced divorce is not a hardship. This is recognized by the European Court of Human Rights.RESPONSE:  LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION IS AN IMPORTANT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT •\t\tLegal\tgender\trecognition\tis\tmore\tthan\ta\tpiece\tof\tpaper.\tIt\tis\tabout\tsomeone being recognized for who they truly are, in every aspect of daily life.

A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE14ARGUMENT:  TRANS PEOPLE SHOULD  WAIT FOR SAME-SEX MARRIAGE LIKE EVERYONE ELSEThere is no need to change gender recognition or birth registration laws. If and when same-sex marriage is introduced, trans and intersex people will have the same legal rights as everyone else. RESPONSE:  SAME-SEX MARRIAGE DOES NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZE  EVERYONE’S RIGHT TO MARRY•\t\tTrans\tpeople’s\tfundamental\tright\tto\trecognition\tbefore\tthe\tlaw\timpacts\ton all aspects of their lives. Recognizing this right should not rely on hope that marriage laws will be reformed.•\t\tMarriage\tequality\tis\ttypically\tunderstood\tto\tbe\tabout\tsame-sex\tmarriage\tfor lesbian and gay couples. Same-sex laws are not always inclusive of people who have documentation stating their sex or gender is other than male or female. Marriage equality may also require repealing laws that specifically\texclude\tthose\twith\ta\tnon-binary\tbirth\tcertificate\tfrom\taccess\tto\tmarriage. It may also require repealing laws that annul a marriage because one spouse has an intersex variation.•\t\tEnabling\tsame-sex\tcouples\tto\tmarry\tdoes\tnot\tautomatically\tgive\ta\tmarried\tperson the right to gender recognition. Sweden introduced marriage equality in 2009, but the forced divorce obligation on trans people was removed only in June 2012 after a 2010 court decision.38•\t\tSome\tmarriage\tequality\tlaws\tplace\tadditional\trestrictions\ton\ttrans\tpeople,\tsuch as requiring a spouse’s consent before an existing heterosexual marriage is converted into a same-sex / same-gender marriage. 39A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE15CONCLUSIONGender recognition laws that exclude people who are married, and amount to forced divorce for those who are already married, violate fundamental human rights. A LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ISSUE BRIEF       L ICENSE TO BE YOURSELF: MARRIAGE AND FORCED DIVORCE16Gender recognition laws that exclude people who are married, and amount to forced divorce for those who are already married, violate fundamental human rights. These rights include the right to privacy, to marriage, and to recognition before  the law (including the dignity, equality, and security such recognition provides).  In addition, forced divorce has significant financial and emotional implications for  a person’s partner and children. In January 2015, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health updated its statement in support of legal gender recognition. It explicitly states that “marital status and parental status should not affect legal recognition of gender change.” The statement concludes by urging governments “to eliminate unnecessary barriers, and to institute simple and accessible administrative procedures for transgender people to obtain legal recognition of gender, consonant with each individual’s identity.”40Intersex people wishing to amend sex details on official documents often face the additional barrier of navigating laws and policies that are designed around the experiences of trans people. For example, these may require evidence of clinical treatment for gender transition and reinforce the role of medical experts in pathologizing not only gender diversity but also intersex variations. These requirements are also obstacles for many trans people, particularly those who do not wish to medically transition.Internationally, strategic litigation has resulted in court decisions emphasizing that trans people should not be required to choose between their personal self-determination and their right to marriage. Progressive laws and policies respect such rights by removing any requirement to be single, or for married people to divorce, in order to obtain recognition before the law. They also resist any form of spousal veto that undermines people’s right to make decisions about their own gender identity, and to take responsibility for negotiating the impacts on those decisions with their partner. Marriage equality can be an important step towards achieving more progressive gender recognition laws. However it has not always been sufficient, particularly when framed narrowly as same-sex marriage. Nor can legal gender recognition wait for decisions about marriage equality. Recognition before the law is a fundamental right—necessary to enable dignity, equality, and security in virtually all aspects of people’s daily lives.

In contrast, a 2008 Supreme Court decision found that where the individual was biologically or naturally intersex, it was reasonable to allow the person to determine his or her own gender (Republic of the Philippines vs. Jennifer Cagandahan, Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division, 12 September 2008).

    "abstract": "The vast majority of trans people around the world cannot obtain legal recognition of—or official documents that match—their gender identity. Where laws do recognize trans people, they often exclude those who are married. This forces trans people to choose between legal recognition of their gender identity or their marriage. Forced divoce violates trans people's right to privacy, marriage, and recognition under the law.This brief explains legal restrictions that affect the recognition of married trans and intersex people. It examines case law and addresses key arguments made by those who oppose such recognition. It is the first of four resources for activists that accompany Open Society's 2014 report on legal gender recognition across the world, License to Be Yourself.",
