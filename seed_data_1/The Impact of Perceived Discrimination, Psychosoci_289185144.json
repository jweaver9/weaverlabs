GLOVER \nSubmitted to the Office of Graduate and Professional Studies of \nTexas A&M University \nin partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of\nDOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY\nChair of Committee:  Linda G. Castillo\nCommittee Members: Timothy Elliott \nOi-Man Kwok \nBrandie Taylor \nHead of Department: Shanna Hagan-Burke\nAugust 2017 \nMajor Subject: Counseling Psychology\nCopyright 2017 Angel Glover\nii\nABSTRACT \nAfrican American gay and bisexual men are members of marginalized groups \nthat have historically faced persecution and discrimination. Although there is a well-\ndocumented relationship between discrimination and engagement in health risk \nbehaviors, fewer studies have explored how the perception of discrimination among \nAfrican American gay and bisexual men might be predictive of engagement in sexual \nhealth risk behaviors. The purpose of this study was to explore how psychosocial \nvariables, such as perceived discrimination and education attainment, could affect \nengagement in sexual health risk behaviors. This study also explored relationships \nbetween perceived sexual orientation discrimination and health risk behaviors, while \nexamining educational attainment and knowledge of HIV preventive practices as \nmoderators. \nParticipants in this study included 3,916 African American gay and bisexual \nmen. Utilizing structural equation modeling, the proposed hypothesized model obtained \ngood fit χ2 (N = 3,916, df = 24) = 125.54, p > .05; CFI = .94; TLI = .89; RMSEA = .033. \nResults indicated perceived discrimination mediated the educational attainment-sexual \nhealth risk behavior relationship. Additionally, perceived discrimination increased the \nlikelihood of engaging in sexual health risk behaviors. Engagement in HIV preventive \npractices was found to weaken the association between perceived discrimination and \nsexual health risk behaviors. Additional results are discussed based on future research \nimplications and future preventive programming.\niii\nDEDICATION\nThis dissertation is dedicated to my parents Rev.

Additionally, White gay and bisexual men accounted for the highest number of \nnew HIV infections with African American men accounting for the second largest \nnumber (CDC, 2015b; CDC, 2012). However, compared to their White and Hispanic \ncounterparts, African American gay and bisexual men are disproportionately impacted \nand severely affected by the disease (CDC, 2015b; CDC, 2017a). Thus, continued \nstudies are needed to understand the unique experiences of African American gay and \nbisexual men that could be contributing to new incidences of HIV infection and the \noverall elevated prevalence of HIV infection. \nTo date, numerous studies have explored variables that are believed to increase \nthe prevalence of HIV infection among minority populations; however, many of these \nstudies misleadingly assign explanatory measures to constructs of race and sexual \norientation (Helms, Jernigan, & Mascher, 2005). Although these studies have provided a \nplethora of useful information on the prevalence of HIV infection and engagement in \n2 \nsexual health risk behaviors, these studies do not examine the unique psychosocial \nexperiences, such as discrimination, that could be contributing to the disparities in HIV \ninfection rates among racial and sexual minorities (CDC, 2011a; CDC, 2017a). \nApproaching health research among racial and sexual minorities with the incorporation \nof psychosocial factors, such as discrimination, provides a better description of \ndifferences of HIV infection rates and health risk behaviors among minority populations. \nFurthermore, understanding the impact of perceived discrimination on engagement in \nhealth risk behaviors is important in providing culturally sensitive prevention efforts and \nmental health treatment. Because previous research suggests that perceived \ndiscrimination and education attainment are related to minority health outcomes, \nresearch is needed on these constructs and their association to health risk behaviors \namong African American gay and bisexual men. Thus, the purpose of this study is to \nexamine if psychocultural factors, such as perceived discrimination, educational \nattainment, and knowledge of HIV preventive practices, are related to engagement in \nhealth risk behaviors for African American gay and bisexual men. \nFor African American gay and bisexual men, self-identification and perceived \ngroup membership of sexual and racial minority groups are fundamental concepts in \nexamining the perception of discrimination. Group identification is based on the \nendorsement of similar self-perceived attributes, emotional, romantic, and/or sexual \nattractions toward a specific gender(s) and endorsement of cultural norms of both the \nBlack and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) communities \n(American Psychological Association, 2015; Hogg, 2006; Tajfel, 1981). Group \n3 \nmembership and self-identification of being gay or bisexual is referenced in this study as \nsexual minority status. Sexual minority status is based on the participant’s endorsement \nand self-identification of being gay or bisexual. Two terms are used to describe this \npopulation: (a) gay and bisexual men and (b) Men who have Sex with Men (MSM). \nThroughout the health literature the terms are used interchangeably; however, the term \nMSM utilizes specific sexual behaviors to categorize this population, whereas, the terms \ngay and bisexual are concepts describing one element of an individual’s identity (Young \n& Meyer, 2005). While MSM may include gay and bisexual men, in some studies the \nterm also includes men who have sex with other men, but who may not identify as gay \nor bisexual. For the present study, the term gay and bisexual is used as it corresponds to \nthe participants’ self-described sexual orientation. \nSexual Minority Status and Perceived Discrimination \nAlthough negative attitudes, beliefs, and treatment of sexual minorities have \nchanged within the past two decades, sexual orientation discrimination still persists in \nthe United States (Herek, 2009). Sexual orientation discrimination is defined as the \nbelief that LGB individuals are treated differently or harassed because of perception of \none’s sexual orientation (Banks, Kohn-Wood & Spencer, 2006). Sexual minorities are \nfaced with persistent hostility and discrimination (Herek, 2009, 2003; Rostosky, Riggle, \nHorne, & Miller, 2009). In 2010, only 52% of Americans believed that gay and lesbian \nrelationships were acceptable. Forty-three percent of Americans believed that same-sex \nrelationships were morally wrong (CDC, 2011a).\n4 \nFor African American gay and bisexual men, discriminatory acts may also occur \nbased on both ethnic and sexual minority statuses. As such, individuals’ perception of \ndiscrimination can be influenced by their ethnic and sexual minority identities. One \nstudy, utilizing data collected from Wave Two of the National Epidemiological Survey \nof Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), sought to examine the perception of \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation, race or ethnicity and gender, and mental \nhealth ailments among White, Black, Native American, Asian, and Hispanic lesbians, \ngay and bisexual adults in the United States (Bostwick, Boyd, Hughes, West, and \nMcCabe, 2014). Of the total Wave Two population (N = 34,652), an estimated 2% \npercent were identified as being lesbian (n = 145), gay (n = 190) or bisexual (n = 242) \n(Bostwick, et al., 2014). The researchers found that compared to their White \ncounterparts, Black, Native American, Asian, and Hispanic gay and bisexual men were \nmore likely to report experiencing discrimination based on race, gender, and/or sexual \norientation. \nAlthough African American gay and bisexual men have similar racial, gender, \nand non-heteronormative identities, it is important to note that the two groups do not \nconstitute a homogeneous group (Balsam & Mohr, 2007; Dudley, 2013; Savin-Williams, \n2001). For instance, Balsam et al. (2007) examined differences in how bisexual, lesbian, \nand gay adults adapt to the marginalized status that is often assigned to the LGBT \ncommunity. The study surveyed 613 lesbian (n =273), gay (n =186), and bisexual (n \n=37) adults in the United States. The results suggested that bisexual participants \nexperienced high levels of identity confusion. Additionally, bisexual participants\n5 \nendorsed lower levels of self-disclosure and sense of community within the larger LGBT \ncommunity. Although the sample used in this study was predominantly White (90%), \nthis study still highlights the importance of examining experiences of sexual minorities \nbased on their own respective sexual identities. The literature commonly presents studies \nin which gay and bisexual men are grouped together, limiting what is known about the \nexperiences of each group, respectively (Miller, André, Ebin, & Bessonova, 2007). As \nnoted by scholars, gay and bisexual men have their own respective sexual identities, \nnorms, and values associated with their respective social identity (D'Augelli, 1994; \nDiamond, 2006). For example, Diamond (2006) presented a feminist theorized article \nthat begins with a critique of LGBT literature that either (a) excludes bisexuality, or (b) \npresents bisexuality as a development stage that precludes identification of a gay or \nlesbian sexual orientation. As a possible remedy, Diamond (2006) suggests focusing on \nexploring the uniqueness that each sexual minority group encounters through their \nrespective development process of sexual orientation. Utilizing this theorized framework \nof examination presents the potential to uncover an authentic perception of the differing \nnorms, values, and respective identities among gay and bisexual men (Diamond, 2006). \nAs such, it is possible that African American gay and bisexual men may perceive \ndiscrimination differently and/or perceive different amounts of discrimination based on \ntheir respective group identification. For example, Bostwick et al. (2014) found that \ncompared to their bisexual counterparts, gay men were more likely to report \ndiscriminatory experiences based on sexual orientation. Additionally, bisexual \nindividuals may perceive the source of discrimination differently than their gay\n6 \ncounterparts (Bostwick et al., 2014). Bisexual individuals may encounter discrimination \nfrom both heterosexual populations as well as from other sexual minority groups \n(Bostwick, 2012; Bostwick et al., 2014; Gurevich, Mathieson, & Bower, 2002; \nHequembourg & Brallier, 2009). \nResearch suggests that there are five types of perceived discrimination often \nreported by LGBTQ individuals (Herek, 2009; Mays & Cochran, 2001). They include \n(a) being called names or insulted; (b) receiving poorer services in restaurants and \nbusiness; (c) being treated unfairly at work or school; (d) being denied or given poorer \nquality health care; and (e) being physically attacked or injured because of one’s sexual \nminority status. What follows is an overview of the possible perceived discrimination of \nAfrican American gay and bisexual men. \nCalled names or insulted. The larger LGBTQ body of literature provides key \ninsights about the perception of verbal discriminatory events since few studies \nspecifically examine this among African American gay and bisexual men, thus the larger \nbody of literature is referenced. Studies have documented incidents in which gay and \nbisexual men have perceived being called names or verbally insulted because of their \nsexual minority status (Berrill, 1992; Mays et al., 2001; Otis & Skinner, 1996; Pilkington \n& D’Augelli, 1995). One previously presented study (Huebner et al., 2014), examined \nharassment, discrimination, and violence among gay and bisexual men. In this study, the \nsample consisted of 1,248 gay and bisexual men from the southwestern area of the \nUnited States (Huebner et al., 2014). Participants were recruited via venue-driven \nsampling, as a part of a larger community-level HIV prevention intervention. Results \n7 \nindicated that 37% of study participants perceived verbal anti-gay discriminatory \nremarks within the last six months. \nReilly, Neaigus, Jenness, Wendel, Marshall, and Hagan (2015) also conducted a \nstudy measuring the experiences of discrimination and HIV risk among a sample of gay \nand bisexual men. The study was conducted in New York and participants were \nrecruited from bars, parks, street locations, dance clubs, and restaurants (Reilly et al., \n2015). The diverse sample consisted of gay and bisexual males who identified as 118 \nAfrican American males (23.3%), 200 Latino males (39.4%), 147 White males (29.05%) \nand 42 (8.3%) other races. Of the total sample (N =509), 78.4% of participants identified \nas gay (n =399), and 19.4% identified as bisexual (n =99) (Reilly et al., 2015). The \nresults depicted that 45% of the total sample reported being called names or insulted \nbecause of their sexual orientation (Reilly et al., 2015). \nResearch focusing on the perceptions of verbal discrimination within the school \nsettings also provides insight into the perception of discrimination among this population \n(Huebner et al., 2004). The 2011 National School Climate Survey, conducted among \n8,584 students ages 13-20, determined that 80% of LGBT students perceived verbal \ndiscrimination because of their sexual orientation. Similarly, 91.4% of LGBT students \nhearing the word “gay” used in a negative way that caused participants psychological \ndistress (Kosciw, Greytak, Bartkiewicz, Boesen, & Palmer, 2011). \nThe perception of being called names or insulted may be different for gay and \nbisexual men. From the Bostwick et al. (2014) study, previously presented, gay men \nwere more likely to report being called names, insulted, or being verbally threatened \n8 \n(Bostwick et al., 2014), whereas bisexuals were found to report fewer discrimination \nexperiences of being verbally threatened (Bostwick et al., 2014). However, another study \nreported that 26 percent of gay men compared to 37 percent of bisexual men experience \nrape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner (Human Rights Campaign, \n2017). Therefore there are mixed findings. \nBisexual individuals may experience a different type of verbal discrimination. \nBisexual individuals who are verbally challenged with questions on the validity of \nbisexuality as a sexual orientation may perceive this as discrimination (Klesse, 2011; \nMulick & Wright, 2002; Kollen, 2013). For example, in a conceptual article by Alarie \nand Gaudet (2013), three mechanisms were presented in which bisexuality as a sexual \nidentity can be invisible. The mechanisms include “(a) depicting bisexuality as \ntemporary, (b) making it almost impossible to be a ‘real' bisexual, and (c) devaluing \nbisexuality” (Alarie & Gaudet, p.192). Bisexual individuals may perceive any of the \nthree proposed mechanisms of invisibility as verbal discrimination. \nReceived poorer services. After a thorough search of the literature, two studies \nfound the perception of discrimination in terms of receiving poorer services based solely \non sexual orientation among African American gay and bisexual men. Research on the \nperception of receiving poorer services in restaurants, business, and other agencies are \nmore prevalent within studies that group all LGBT individuals together without \nexploring psychocultural differences such as race and ethnicity. The Pew Research \nCenter (2013) conducted a study in April of 2013 examining attitudes, experiences, and \nvalues among American LGBT adults. Of the total LGBT adult sample (N =1,197), there\n9 \nwere 398 gay, 277 lesbian, 479 bisexual, and 43 transgender adults. The study was \nconducted among predominantly White participants (n = 331), compared to the 54 \nparticipants who identified as African American. Although the study examined \nnumerous experiences of LGBT adults, the present study focused on the number of \nparticipants who reported receiving poorer services. The study found that 23% of \nparticipants perceived a lifetime prevalence of receiving poorer services in restaurants, \nhotels, and other places of business (Pew Research Center, 2013).\nThe perceived likelihood of receiving poorer services in restaurants, businesses, \nand other agencies may be different for gay and bisexual men. From the Bostwick et al. \n(2014) study previously presented, researchers sought out to examine the perception of \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation, race or ethnicity, and gender, and mental \nhealth ailments among White, Black, Native American, Asian and Hispanic lesbians, \ngay, and bisexual adults in the United States. Findings suggested that gay men were \nmore likely to report facing discriminatory acts in stores and restaurants compared to \ntheir bisexual counterparts. \nPhysically attacked or injured. Research has captured routine incidents of \nviolence in which gay and bisexual men have perceived being physically attacked or \ninjured because of their sexual or racial identities (Herek, 2000). Another study \npreviously presented by Reilly et al. (2015) found that 15.1 % (N = 503) of MSM \nparticipants in New York reported being physically attacked or injured within the last 12 \nmonths. \nThe National Report on Hate Violence Against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, \n10 \nTransgender, Queer, and HIV-Affected Communities (2013) reported that racial and \nsexual minorities face disproportionate acts of discriminatory violence and that there is a \ndifference between the prevalence rates in which gay men and bisexual men have \nexperienced being physically attacked (National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, \n2013). Herek, Gills, and Cogan (1999) also conducted a study on experiences of hate-\ncrime victimization among 2,259 gay, bisexual men, and lesbian adults living in the \nSacramento area of California. One finding from the study suggested that 28% of gay \nmen reported being physically attacked or injured at least once within their lifetime. \nAlthough the perception of being physically attacked or injured based on one’s sexual \norientation is not believed to differ based on each respective sexual orientation, the \ncurrent study seeks to explore if one group encounters more of this form of \ndiscrimination. \nTreated unfairly at work or school. For LGBT individuals, workplace \ndiscrimination is pervasive (Croteau & Bieschke, 1996). Few studies have examined \nunfair treatment at work or school, specifically among African American gay and \nbisexual men. Within the context of the workplace, sexual minorities may be concerned \nabout coming out/being out, being alienated, and job security when their sexual \norientation is known by colleagues and employers (Bernstein & Swartwout, 2012). In a \nreport published by the Pew Research Center (2013), 21% of LGBT participants (Total \nN =1,197) perceived a lifetime prevalence of being treated unfairly by an employer \nbecause of their sexual orientation. Another study previously described found that 22%\n11 \nof MSM participants indicated perceiving unfair treatment at work or in school (Reilly et \nal., 2015). \nOther researchers also have documented cases of unfair treatment of LGBT \nindividuals within the school setting. Rankin, Weber, Blumenfeld, and Frazer (2010) \npresented a national report on the State of Higher Education for LGBT adults aimed at \nhighlighting the discriminatory experiences of LGBT individuals in higher education \nsettings. One finding presented in this report described how collegiate sexual minority \nstudents, faculty members, and administrators still face experiences of discrimination \nand stigmatization. Currently, in 32 states, sexual minorities lack legal protection from \nworkplace and employment discrimination (Human Rights Campaign, 2014). For gay \nand bisexual individuals who live in states without legal discriminatory protection, such \nas the participants in this study, sexual minorities may be particularly vulnerable and \nmore likely to experience being treated unfairly at work (Badgett, Sears, Lau, & Ho, \n2009). Tilcsik (2011) conducted a social psychology study examining employment \ndiscrimination and found that sexual orientation discrimination varied geographically \nwith regional attitudes possibly being influenced by antidiscrimination laws. \nDenied or given lower quality health care. Sexual minorities have unique \nhealth concerns specific to the population and when these health care concerns are not \nacknowledged, individuals may perceive this lack of specialized care as discrimination \n(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011; Mayer, Bradford, Makadon, \nStall, Goldhammer, & Landers, 2008)). Factors such as perceived invisibility (Herek, \n2009), lack of culturally sensitive practitioners or programs, previous negative\n12 \nexperiences with health care providers (Mayer et al., 2008), and fear of sexual \norientation discrimination (Stuber, Meyer, & Link, 2008) may impede sexual minorities \naccess to quality health care and increase perceptions of discrimination (Miller et al., \n2007; (CDC, 2011a). For instance, Reilly et al. (2015) found that 6.7% of MSM \nparticipants reported being given lower quality health care or denied health because of \ntheir sexual orientation. Perceived discrimination has been identified as a determinant of \nhealth-seeking behaviors (Pascoe & Richman, 2009). Kats and Ranji (2014) conducted \nan online survey on perceived access to health care and coverage among the LGBT \ncommunity. Results concluded that three in ten gay and bisexual men (N = 431) \nendorsed feeling uncomfortable discussing their sexual orientation with health care \nprofessionals, thus impacting the perceived accessibility of health care (Kats & Ranji, \n2014). Other findings indicated that 56% of participants endorsed items stating that a \ndoctor has never recommended HIV testing and 61% of participants reported rarely or \nnever discussing HIV during visits with their doctors (Kats & Ranji, 2014). Another \nstudy conducted by Bernstein, Begier, Koblin, Karpati, and Murrill (2008) surveyed 454 \ngay and bisexual men as a part of the NHBS New York site between July 2004 and \nJanuary 2005. The study aimed to explore sexual minority status disclosure to health \ncare providers. Findings suggested that compared to their White counterparts, African \nAmerican MSM were less likely to disclose same-sex attraction to health care providers. \nEach of these studies provides important information about discrimination experienced \nby gay and bisexual men, in terms of access to quality health care.\n13 \nBecause of perceived healthcare discrimination, for African American gay and \nbisexual men, quality of care and treatment adherence could be affected (Penner, \nDovidio, Edmondson, Dailey, Markova, Albrecht, & Gaertner, 2009). \nPerceived healthcare discrimination could increase the risk of negative health \noutcomes among this population. For example, Koblin et al. (2013) examined HIV \nacquisition in a cohort of African American MSM found that younger participants were \nless likely to have a usual place for health care and had unmet health needs. It was also \nfound that three in ten gay and bisexual men who reported not having a primary care \nphysician were primarily younger, had lower income, and identified as being a dual \nracial/sexual minority (Koblin et al., 2013). The perception of discrimination for gay and \nbisexual men may differ. For instance, Bostwick et al. (2014) reported that compared to \ntheir bisexual counterparts, gay men were more likely to report discrimination within the \nhealth care setting. \nEducational Attainment And The Sexual Minority Status, Perceived Discrimination \nRelationship \nBased on previous studies, educational attainment is believed to moderate the \nperception of discrimination (Zhang, Hong, Takeuchi, & Mossakowski, 2012). As a \nmoderator, educational attainment determines under what conditions the relationship \nbetween an individual’s sexual minority status and one’s perception of discrimination \nwould differ. Few studies have examined education attainment as a moderator for sexual \nminority status and perceived discrimination. However, one study found that participants \nwith at least some college were more likely to have an increased perception of\n14 \ndiscrimination related to their sexual minority status (Huebner et al., 2004). Educational \nattainment has been more frequently examined as a moderating variable that can \nenhance the perception of discrimination, within the context of the racial discrimination \nliterature. For example, Zhang et al. (2012) conducted a study on the relationships \nbetween perceived discrimination, psychological distress, and education among Asian \nAmericans. The study utilized data collected from the 2002-2003 National Latino and \nAsian American Study (NLAAS). The sample consisted of 2,085 Asian adults. The \nstudy found that education status was a moderator for perceived discrimination and \npsychological distress for Asian American individuals. In that study, the effects of racial \ndiscrimination-related stress was stronger for participants with college or higher levels of \neducation (Zhang et al., 2012). \nAnother study examined the experiences and consequences of perceived racial \ndiscrimination among 312 African Americans from the Detroit, Michigan area, (Broman, \nMavaddat, & Hsu, 2000). Results suggested that highly educated African Americans \nwere more likely to perceive racial discrimination; in particular, participants who had not \ngraduated college, but who had some college, perceived the most racial discrimination \n(Broman et al., 2000). One other study conducted by Reilly et al. (2015) found that \nparticipants with less than a high school education reported being physically attacked \ndue to the perception of their sexual minority status more frequently. Each of these \nstudies provides support for educational attainment as a moderator. This present study \nexplores if educational attainment enhances the perception of sexual minority \ndiscrimination. \n15 \nPerceived Discrimination Relationship To Sexual Health Risk Behaviors \nAfrican American gay and bisexual men are more significantly affected by HIV \ninfection more when compared to their other racial minority counterparts (CDC, 2011b). \nFor instance, an estimated 477,175 gay and bisexual men were diagnosed and living with \nHIV; of that number, 145,707 were African American, 99,495 were Hispanics (CDC, \n2011b). The CDC also reports the lifetime projected rate of HIV infection for African \nAmerican men is one-in-two, compared to one-in-four for their Hispanic counterparts \nand one-in-eleven for their White counterparts (CDC, 2017a). \nHealth risk behaviors are commonly identified in the literature as behaviors that \ncan lead to negative health outcomes, such as unintended pregnancy, Sexual Transmitted \nInfections (STIs), and HIV infection (Pascoe & Richman, 2009). The Youth Risk \nBehavior Surveillance System defines health risk behaviors as (a) unintentional injuries \nand violence; (b) tobacco use; (c) alcohol and drug use; (d) unhealthy dietary behaviors; \n(e) physical activities; and (f) risky sexual behaviors that can contribute to unintended \npregnancy STIs and HIV infection (Eaton, Kann, Kinchen, Shanklin, Ross, & Hawkins, \n2012). This study focused exclusively on risky sexual behaviors and substance use in \nrelation to sexual activity. Health risk behaviors examined include (a) having multiple \nsexual partners; (b) having sex while under the influence of alcohol or drugs; and (c) \nbeing previously diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. \nThe HIV literature provides insights as to why there are elevated HIV infection \nrates among African American gay and bisexual men by examining health risk \nbehaviors. Perceived discrimination has been significantly correlated to risky behaviors,\n16 \nsuch as reduced physical activity, substance abuse, and smoking (Yoshikawa, Wilson, \nChae, & Cheng, 2004; Samet, Pace & Cheng, 2010). Studies also support significant \nrelationships between perceived discrimination and sexual health risk behaviors (Fields, \nBogart, Galvan, Wagner, Klein, & Schuster, 2013; Kalichman et al., 2005; Reilly et al., \n2015). For example, Frye et al. (2015) used secondary data analysis to examine sexual \norientation, race-based discrimination, and sexual HIV risk behaviors among urban \nMSM (N = 1,369). Results indicated that sexual orientation discrimination at home or in \nsocial neighborhood settings were positively correlated with increased HIV acquisition \nrisk. Another study examined if psychosocial, behavioral, and cultural factors could \npredict health risk behaviors among Latino gay and bisexual men (Jarama, Kennamer, \nPoppen, Hendricks, & Bradford, 2005). The sample consisted of 250 gay and bisexual \nmen who self-identified as primarily immigrants from El Salvador. The results of this \nstudy suggested that Latino MSM’s experience of discrimination were predictive of \nengagement in HIV health risk behaviors (Jarama et al., 2005). \nEngagement in HIV Preventive Practices As A Moderator for the Relationship \nBetween Perceived Discrimination and Health Risk Behaviors \nAs research has shown, there is a detrimental relationship between discrimination \nand health risk behaviors. However, there are mixed findings on how HIV preventive \npractices impact subsequent sexual health risk behaviors. Health scholars have noted that \nvariables such as engagement in HIV preventive practices can decrease negative health \noutcomes (Jemmott, Jemmott, & Fong, 1992; Weinhardt, Carey, Johnson & Bickman, \n1999). Other scholars have found that HIV preventive practices do not solely impact\n17 \nbehaviors leading to HIV infection (Noroozinejad, Yarmohamadi, Bazrafkan, Sehat, \nRezazadeh, & Ahmadi, 2013; Salgado, Díaz Pérez, & Maldonado, 1996). The \nDepartment of State and Health Services (2013) reported a decrease of new HIV \ninfection among African Americans between 2008 and 2013, believed to be directly \nrelated prevention efforts. As such, it is possible that engagement in HIV preventive \npractices can impact the perceived discrimination-sexual health risk behavior \nrelationship. \nThroughout the health literature and foundationally incorporated in many HIV \nprevention programs is the goal of increasing knowledge of HIV preventive practices \namong at-risk populations. However, there is limited information about the impact of \nengagement in HIV preventive practices in relation to incidents of perceived \ndiscrimination and possible subsequent engagement in health risk behaviors. As a \npossible moderator, engagement in HIV preventive practices determines the conditions \nwhich the relationship between an individual’s level of perceived discrimination and \nengagement in health risk behaviors would differ. Engagement in HIV preventive \npractices is defined as awareness of HIV/STI statuses and methods used to increase \ninformation aimed at reducing engagement in risky sexual behaviors. In this study, \nengagement in HIV preventive practices are specifically measured by the participants’ \nawareness of their own HIV status, awareness of HIV statuses of sexual partner(s), and \nhaving been tested for HIV. Individuals who lack information on how health risk \nbehaviors are negatively impacting well-being are less likely to challenge the detrimental \nhabits providing short-term gratification (Bandura, 2004). Additionally, persons who \n18 \nhave inadequate health literacy on HIV prevention are at an increased risk of contracting \nthe disease and experiencing negative health outcomes (Kalichman et al., 2005; \nKalichman et al.,, 2016; Herek et al., 2009). \nOne HIV preventive practice that has been suggested to effectively decrease the \nprobability of HIV infection is being aware of and discussing a person’s HIV status with \nsexual partners (CDC, 2015a). Awareness of a partner’s HIV status can be prompted by \nopen communication among sexual partners. For example, researchers conducted a study \non correlates HIV/STI testing and disclosure among HIV-negative collegiate MSM \n(Wilkerson, Fuchs, Brady, Jones-Webb, & Rosser, 2014). As a part of a larger \nprospective study conducted in 16 U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), 930 \ncollegiate MSMs were asked to reflect on a time within the last three months that they \nhad protected or unprotected anal sex and discussed HIV status with their partner \n(Wilkerson et al., 2014). Findings suggested that over half of participants (57.8%) \ndiscussed HIV status with new sexual partners (Wilkerson et al., 2014). This study \npresents the importance of communication and disclosure of one’s HIV statuses with \nsexual partners, as a method of decreasing engagement in risky sexual behaviors. \nAnother facet of HIV preventive practice presented in the present study is the \nrelationship between knowledge of sexual partners’ HIV status and engagement in risky \nsexual behaviors. For example, one study examined knowledge of partners’ HIV status \nand condom usage among 3,538 HIV-positive patients participating in clinical care in \nTanzania, Kenya, and Namibia (Bachanas et al., 2013). Although this population is \ndifferent from the present study, there are some key insights that demonstrate how\n19 \nawareness of a partner’s HIV status impacts engagement in health risk behaviors. \nResults from this study suggested that 64% of participants knew their partner’s HIV \nstatus, and participants were more likely to report condom usage if disclosure of HIV \nstatus was shared among partners (Bachanas et al., 2013). This study supports the impact \nthat awareness of sexual partners’ HIV status can have on engagement in health risk \nbehaviors. \nHealth scholars and prominent public health agencies have identified the \nusefulness of theory-driven, evidenced-based practices that aim to increase the knowledge \nof HIV preventive practices, with the goal of decreased HIV transmission and infection \namong at-risk populations (CDC, 2014b; Johnson et al., 2003; Rebchook, Kegeles, & \nHuebner, 2006). For example, one-on-one and intimate group prevention programs have \nshown effectiveness in reducing unsafe sexual behaviors (CDC, 2014b; Leaver, Allman, \nMeyers, & Veugelers, 2004; O'Donnell, Stueve, Joseph & Flores, 2014). Understanding \nthis complex relationship can aid in developing effective interventions and inform policies \ndirected at decreasing HIV/STI infections among African American gay and bisexual men \n(CDC, 2015a). Findings suggest that a policy focused on increasing access and \nattainability of education and knowledge of HIV preventive practices could also greatly \nincrease health behaviors among at-risk populations (Cutler & Lleras-Muney, 2006). \nHypotheses \nUsing Structural Equation Modeling, the current study aims to examine the \nrelationships between sexual minority status, perceived discrimination, educational\n20 \nattainment, health risk behaviors, and knowledge of HIV preventive practices among \nAfrican American gay and bisexual men. The following are hypothesized: \nHypothesis 1: There will be a relationship between sexual orientation (0 = gay; 1 = \nbisexual) and perceived discrimination. \nHypothesis 2: Educational attainment will modify the sexual orientation-perceived\ndiscrimination relationship. \nHypothesis 3: Perceived discrimination will mediate the educational attainment-sexual \nhealth risk behavior relationship. \nHypothesis 4: Perceived discrimination will be positively correlated with sexual health \nrisk behaviors. \nHypothesis 5: Engagement in HIV preventive practices will modify the perceived \ndiscrimination-sexual health risk behaviors relationship.\n21 \nCHAPTER II \nMETHODOLOGY\nData used in this study is from the National Health Behavioral Surveillance \nSystem (NHBS), Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) cycle 2014. The NHBS is a large \ncross-sectional study funded by the Center for Disease and Prevention that is conducted \nin collaboration with local and state health departments as well as universities and \ncommunity-based originations in 20 cities across the United States (CDC, 2015b). The \noverall NHBS studies aim to assess behavioral surveillance among individuals with \nincreased risk of HIV infection (CDC, 2015b). The groups identified as high risk include \nmen who have sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDU), and heterosexual \nindividuals (HET). Data is collected every three years for the respective at-risk \npopulations. \nTo recruit gay and bisexual participants and collect data, the NHBS utilizes \nvenue sampling with a study design that focuses on reducing selection bias (Gallagher, \nSullivan, Lansky, & Onorato, 2007; Reilly et al., 2015). Participants are recruited from \npublic venues such as bars, street locations, LGBT pride events, and social clubs. The \nNHBS specifically uses a standardized interview to collect information on HIV health \nrisk behaviors, psychosocial elements such as discrimination and stigma, and \ninformation related to HIV preventive practices. The NHBS focuses on collecting \nrotating 12-month cycles of surveillance data from participants within metropolitan areas \namong populations that have been identified as high risk for HIV infection by the CDC. \n22 \nEach participant completed an approximately 30-45 minute interviewer-administered \nstandardized survey that included demographics questions on race, gender, age, \nhousehold income, educational level, and sexual orientation. The survey also asked \nparticipants questions about sexual health risk behaviors, incarceration history, drug use, \nprevious STI infection(s) and HIV testing history and status. Numerous other studies \nhave also provided information on the methods of the NHBS study (Gallagher et al., \n2007; Reilly et al., 2015). \nEligible NHBS MSM cycle 2014 participants had the following attributes: (a) \nabove the age of 18; (b) lived in one of the 20 requirement areas at the time of \ncollection; (c) identified as being male; (d) had at least one sexual partner within the past \n12 months; (e) reported engaging in anal or oral sex with one or more same-sex \npartner(s); and (f) were given and signed an informed-consent form. A total of 10,369 \nparticipants were recruited. Of these participants, 42% were below the age 29 years, \n79.5% self-identified as gay, 17.9% identified as bisexual, and 2.2% identified as \nheterosexual. In terms of education, 4.6% competed grades 11 or under, 21.6% \ngraduated or obtained a GED, 32.1% had some college, associate’s degree, or technical \ndegree, 27.0% obtained a bachelor’s degree, and 14.7% had some postgraduate studies. \nThe household income of 75% of participants was above the federal poverty level. \nRacially, 38% of the population identified as Caucasian 38%, Black 28%, and Hispanic \nor Latino 28%. \nParticipants in the current study: identified their ethnic/racial identity as non-\nHispanic Black/African American (n= 3,916); identified their sexual orientation as either\n23 \ngay (n= 3422, 87.4%) or bisexual (n=494, 12.6%); and 64.34% were below the age 45 \nyears. The educational distribution of participants included: 17.14% less than high \nschool degree; 27.79% high school degree or equivalent; 33.23% some college, \nassociate’s degree, or technical degree; and 21.84% bachelor’s degree and postgraduate \nstudies. \nMeasures \nPerceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination was assessed by five \nquestions commonly presented in the LGBT literature (Berril, 1992; Krieger & Sidney, \n1997; Krieger, Smith, Naishadham, Hartman, & Barbeau, 2005; Mays et al., 2001; \nWilliams, Yan, Jackson, & Anderson, 1997). Participants were asked, “During the past \n12 months, have any of the following things happened to you because someone knew or \nassumed you were attracted to men?” (a) “called names or insulted,” (b) “received \npoorer services than other people in restaurants, stores, other businesses or agencies,” (c) \n“treated unfairly at work or school,” (d) “denied or given lower quality health care,” and \n(d) “physically attacked or injured.” \nThe original response set consisted of five dichotomized questions. An aggregate \nperceived discrimination variable consisting of the five perceived discrimination \nquestions was created and utilized in the SEM Model. Each “yes” factor equaled 1 point, \nand each “no” response equaled 0 points. A total perceived discrimination score was \ncalculated for each participant. Higher total scores equaled greater perceptions of \ndiscrimination. Cronbach’s alpha was .60 for construct reliability.\n24 \nSexual health risk behaviors. Sexual health risk behaviors, a latent construct \nassessed indirectly through associated items. Elements of the NHBS data set are believed \nto measure this latent variable. These factors have frequently been identified in the \nliterature as being positively correlated with increased HIV infection (Eaton et al., 2012; \nCDC, 2011b). These factors include (a) engaging in condomless anal sex in the past 12 \nmonths; (b) not using a condom the whole time at last sex act; (c) having 2 or more anal \nor oral sexual partners; (d) having sex while under the influence of a controlled \nsubstance at last sex; and (e) having a previous diagnosis of a sexually transmitted \ninfection (STI) including syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and other STI within the past \n12 months. These five factors where originally planned for analysis. However, factors 1 \nand 2 were removed due to the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the NHBS survey. \nThus, the sexual health risk behavior was comprised of (a) having two or more anal or \noral sexual partners; (b) having sex while under the influence of a controlled substance \nat last sex; (c) having a previous diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) \nincluding syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and other STI within the past 12 months. Each \nof these observed factors (1-3) was loaded onto the sexual health risk behavior latent \nvariable. Modeling sexual health risk behaviors as a latent variable provides additional \npower in testing the hypotheses. Additional power is added because the outcome \nvariable, Sexual Health Risk Behaviors, represents the variance shared by the three \nfactors.\nEngagement in HIV preventive practices. Engagement in HIV Preventive\nPractices was  assessed by three questions that fall under a larger global understanding of\n25 \nHIV preventive knowledge presented throughout the health literature. In the originally \nproposed analysis, Engagement in HIV Preventive Practices was comprised of (a) \nknowledge of one’s own HIV status; (b) knowledge of partner(s)’ statuses; (c) having \nparticipated in an HIV preventive session in a one-on-one setting; or (d) having \nparticipated in an HIV preventive session in a group setting. However, the alpha reliability \ncoefficient of these four questions was .30. Given this low reliability, the literature was \nreviewed. The variable was reformatted to obtain questions that better measured this \nconstruct. This variable is now measured with the following questions: (a) knowledge of \none’s own HIV status; (b) knowledge of partner(s)’ statuses; (c) ever tested for HIV.\nDichotomous “yes/no” scores were created to measure each of the knowledge of HIV \npreventive practices. Knowledge of partners statuses were measured as 0 = No (no \nknowledge of partners statues and knowledge of only some partners statues) and 1= Yes \n(knowledge of all partners statuses). A total composite score was created with factors one \nthrough three. Higher total scores equaled greater engagement in HIV preventive \npractices. Cronbach’s alpha was .42 for the variable comprised of three questions. \nSexual orientation and demographics. Sexual orientation was assessed by asking \nparticipants to identify their sexual orientation: (a) Homosexual, Gay (dummy-coded as 0 \nor (b) Bisexual (dummy-coded as 1). Educational attainment was measured as (a) less than \nhigh school degree; (b) high school degree or equivalent; (c) some college, associate’s \ndegree, or technical degree; and (d) bachelor’s degree and postgraduate studies.\n26 \nCHAPTER III \nRESULTS\nDescriptive Results\nPerceived discrimination was one of the predictor variables in this study. Being \n“called names or insulted” was the most frequently (31.2%) perceived type of \ndiscrimination. Some participants (12.8%) reported receiving poorer services than other \npeople in restaurants, stores, other businesses, or agencies. Other participants (11.6%) \nindicated they were treated unfairly at work or school while a smaller set of participants \n(6.4%) reported being physically attacked. \nFor the outcome sexual health risk behavior variable, almost half (46.54%) of the \nparticipants reported using alcohol or other drugs the last time they had sex. Within the \nlast 12 months, 74.9% of participants reported having two or more sexual partners. The \nmajority of participants (87.5%) also reported not having a STI within the last 12 \nmonths. Of participants who did report having an STI, within the last 12 months, 6.9% \nreported Gonorrhea, 4.6% reported Chlamydia, 3.6% reported Syphilis, and 1.5% \nreported having any other STD. In terms of HIV status, 14.7% reported being HIV \npositive, 85.2% reported being HIV negative/ not knowing their status. Table 1 presents \nthe correlations between variables in this study. Table 2 presented additional sample \ncharacteristics.\n27 \nPreliminary Analyses \nStructural equation modeling analysis starts by evaluating for multivariate \nnormality, linearity, multicollinearity, and normal distribution of each variables. Thus, \ndata analysis started by reviewing each variables multivariate distributions. Assessing \nfor normal distribution is important because violations in normal multivariate \ndistribution can cause SEM modeling to yield inaccurate results (Weston, Gore, Chan, & \nCatalano, 2008). Each variable met normal statistical assumptions for multivariate \nnormality, and linearity. Next, univariate and multivariate outliers were assessed by \nusing frequency distributions and exploring for outliers three standard deviations from \nthe mean. Outliers can affect correlations leading to an underestimate or overestimate of \npaths within modeling (Schumacker & Lomax, 2016). Outliers were found on one of the \nfactor loadings for the latent sexual health risk behavior variable (i.e., had multiple \nsexual partners within the last 12 months). \nSeveral factors were considered in examining the outliers for this question. First, \nthis variable in the survey was open ended. Open-ended count variables are often used in \nHIV prevention research, despite the distribution challenges that outliers cause \n(Schroder, Carey, & Vanable, 2003). Count variables are used because they provide in-\ndepth frequencies of sexual behaviors. Second, sample size can impact the probability of \noutliers. In studies with smaller samples sizes, it is more likely that a data point will be \nselected from the densely concentrated area of a normal distribution (Osborne & \nOverbay, 2004; Field, 2013). However, as a study population becomes larger, the sample \npopulation resembles the population from which it is selected. This increases the overall\n28 \nlikelihood that outliers will be present in the sample population (Osborne & Overbay \n2004; Field, 2013). In essence, the outliers in studies with larger samples could be \nlegitimate cases caused by the inherent variability of the population. \nOutliers were kept in this study because they are believed to be a part of the \nnatural variability of the sampled population. Data collection in this study used venue-\ndriven sampling. This means that outlier participants were in the same venues as the rest \nof the participants. Outliers are most at risk of HIV infection and their risk could impact \nthe risk of other participants. Outliers in this study represent less than 1% of the sample, \nwhich decreases the likelihood that an outlier data point would be selected for analysis. \nHowever, to minimize the effect of outliers, this variable was transformed into two risk \ngroups. Using transformations allows outliers to be kept in a study with the skew and \nerror variance possibly caused by outliers to be reduced (Hamilton,1992; Osborne, \n2005). \nThe next step in analysis included assessing for multicollinearity. Multicollinearity \noccurs when multiple predictor variables are highly correlated with one another. \nMulticollinearity measurement errors can impact model fit indices (Grewal, Cote, & \nBaumgartner, 2004; Weston et al., 2008). However, multicollinearity, using variance \ninflation factors (VIF) among predictor variables were not found in this study. \nAdditionally, bivariate correlations were examined to identify possible coefficient values \nof (.85) or higher. Results indicated that none of the bivariate correlations met or \nexceeded the recommended limit.\n29 \nContinuing preliminary analysis focused on reviewing the Skew and Kurtosis \nIndexes for each of the variables in this study. Acceptable skewness and kurtosis were \nfound for continuous variables in this study. The evaluation of skewness and kurtosis \nwas based on well-established norms of absolute value of the Skewness Index ≤ 3 and \nthe absolute value of the Kurtosis Index being ≤ 8 (Curran, West, & Finch, 1996; Kline, \n2005). \nPreliminary analyses also included examining for missing data. Missing data in \nthis study is believed to be missing at random (MAR). To account for minimal missing \ndata, the Full Information Maximum Likelihood Method (FIML) in Mplus was utilized. \nIn the FIML, missing data is estimated based on the population and sample parameters \n(Collins, Shafer, & Kam, 2001). Furthermore, FIML allows all available data \ninformation to be used to estimate the model (Kline, 2015). \nMain Data Analysis \nThe main analysis in this study included SEM modeling. SEM modeling was \nchosen because of the ability to empirically determine how well a proposed theoretical \nmodel is empirically supported and represented within the data (Hays, Revicki, & \nCoyne, 2005; Kline, 2015). For this study, structural equation modeling provided the \nbest fit for the hypothesized research questions of this study. \nKline (2015) suggests the following guidelines for structural equation modeling: \n(a) model specification, (b) model identification, (c) data preparation (previously \ndescribed), (d) model estimation, and (e) model modification. Model specification is \nused for creating and measuring variables, then identifying the hypothesized \n30 \nrelationships among all variables within a theoretical model (Kline, 2015). Model \nidentification occurs when the theoretical parameters of the model are also statically \nidentifiable within modeling software. Model estimation includes reviewing incremental \nand absolute fit indices. Incremental-fit indices, such as the comparative-fit index (CFI) \nand Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), compare the raw chi-squared value to the baseline chi-\nsquared value (Hooper et al., 2008). Whereas absolute fit indices, including Root Mean \nSquare Error of Approximation (RMSEA) and chi-square test of model fit (χ2), \ndetermine how well an a priori model fits the sample data and which model has the most \nsuperior fit (McDonald and Ho, 2002; Hooper et al., 2008, p. 53). In total, four fit \nindices are commonly used to evaluate fit: (a) chi-square test of model fit (χ2), (b) CFI, \n(c) TLI, and (d) RMSEA. Research suggests that models with good fit have indices that \nmeet the following chi-squared (χ2) that is not statistically significant at the p < .05 \nlevel; a chi-square to degrees of freedom ratio (χ2/df) < 3.0; RMSEA that is < .08; and \nCFI/TLI >.95 with adequate range including >.90 (Bentler, 1990; Hu & Bentler, 1999). \nPath coefficients are significant at p < .05. \nThe last step in conducting SEM is model modification. When the a priori model \nhas poor fit, then model modification indices can be incorporated into a new model. \nResearchers suggest the following guidelines in utilizing modification indices to \nimprove model fit. Analysis for the a priori model is conducted to confirm the \ntheoretical underpinnings that have been specified, whereas the modified model is \nexploratory and incorporation of modification indices must make theoretical sense \n(Kline 2015; Schreiber, Nora, Stage, Barlow, & King, 2006). Guidelines also suggest\n31 \nutilizing a small number of modification indices. Overall, the successfulness of the \nmodified model is determined if it is statistically superior to the original model \n(Schreiber et al., 2006). \nBefore the main analysis, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted in order \nto determine how well the observed factor loadings described the underlying latent \nsexual health-risk construct (Kline, 2015; Schreiber et al., 2006). Findings suggest that \nthree factors adequately measured the latent sexual health-risk behavior variable. Path \ncoefficients are significant for each of the three factors: (a) having multiple sexual \npartners (B =.83; S.E. = .06, p < .001); (b) having sex while under the influence of a \ncontrolled substance at last sex (B = .10; S.E. = .04, p = .016); and (c) having a previous \ndiagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) including syphilis, gonorrhea, \nchlamydia and other STI within the past 12 months (B = .30; S.E. = .03, p < .001). \nSEM Model \nTo measure the hypothesis of this study, the Kline (2015) guidelines outlined in \nthe preliminary data analysis section were completed. The SEM a priori model was \nestimated using Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) to account for missing \ndata. The theoretical model for the a priori model is presented in Figure 1. The \nfollowing fit indices were obtained χ2 (N = 3,916, df = 29) = 293.676, p > .05; CFI = \n.85; TLI = .77; and RMSEA = .048. The results of the model indicate poor fit. \nBecause poor fit of the overall model made the interpretation of the relationships \nwithin the model unsuitable, the next step was to review the modification indices to \ndetermine if a better fitting model was possible. To improve fit for the a priori model, \n32 \nthe model parameters were adjusted by adding four pathways. The added pathways \nincluded (a) age  engagement in HIV preventive practices, (b) HIV status  perceived \ndiscrimination, (c) sexual orientation  engagement in HIV preventive practices, and \n(d) HIV status  engagement in HIV preventive practices. Each of the added pathways \nhas been previously studied within the literature (CDC, 2014; Harawa et al., 2014; \nSatterwhite et al., 2008). Additionally, age and HIV status were controlled for in the \nmodel. Statically, new pathways are added to an a priori model if their modification \nindices are 3.84 or above. The addition of these pathways (with modification indices \n3.84 or above) increases the fit of the model (Bowen, 2014). Each of the pathways added \nto the model had modification indices above 3.84. \nSubsequent analysis with the modified model included all of the original \nrelationships from the a priori model in additional to the four new paths added. The \nmodified model was identified. FIML was used to estimate missing data. Utilizing \nanalysis bootstrapping 1000, the modified model obtained adequate fit χ2 (N = 3,916, df \n= 24) = 125.54, p > .05; CFI = .94; TLI = .89; RMSEA = .033. The modified model is \nstatically superior to the original model based on the comparison of the chi-squared \nindex. Figure 2 presents the modified model with all significant coefficient pathways \nwith the addition of modified indices. Table 3 and Table 4 present all of direct and \nindirect path coefficients in the modified model.  \nModified Model Path Coefficients \nHypothesis 1: There will be a relationship between sexual orientation (0 = gay; 1 =\n33 \nbisexual) and perceived discrimination \nThere was not a statically significant relationship between a participant’s sexual \norientation and experience of discrimination (p > .05). \nHypothesis 2: Educational attainment will modify the sexual orientation-perceived\ndiscrimination relationship \nA modifier is defined as a variable that influences the strength (increases or \ndecreases) and direction of a relationship between two other variables (Baron, & Kenny, \n1986). In SEM, moderation effect are tested by creating a multiplied product term that \nconsists of two predictor variables. A product term was created to further investigate if the \nrelationship between sexual orientation and perceived discrimination depends on the \neducational attainment of participants. To create the product term, sexual orientation was \nmultiplied by educational attainment. Controlling for age, results indicated that \neducational attainment was not a moderator for the sexual orientation-perceived discrimination \nrelationship (p > .05). However, the direct relationship between educational attainment and \nperceived discrimination was significant. A negative relationship between educational \nattainment and perceived discrimination was found (B = -0.81; S.E. = .01, p < .001). \nHypothesis 3: Perceived discrimination will mediate the educational attainment-sexual \nhealth risk behavior relationship \nA mediator is defined as “a variable that explains the relationship between two \nvariables” (Baron, & Kenny, 1986, p. 1176). Statistically, mediators are indirect effects \nthat introduce a third variable into the X-Y independent and dependent relationships \n(MacKinnon, Fairchild, & Fritz, 2007). In mediation, there is a causal relation between \n34 \nX, the mediator Z, and the outcome variable Y (X Z Y). Mediation occurs when the \nXY relationship is no longer significant after the mediator Z is introduced. Controlling \nfor age, a mediation effect was tested to see if perceived discrimination mediates the \neducational attainment-sexual health risk behavior relationship.  \nTo test the mediation, the following path coefficients were reviewed. First, a \nsignificant correlation between educational attainment (independent variable) and \nperceived discrimination (mediator) was found (B = -0.81; S.E. = .01, p < .001). Second, \neducational attainment (independent variable) was significantly correlated with sexual \nhealth risk behaviors (dependent) (B = .84; S.E. = .27, p = .002). Third, perceived \ndiscrimination (mediator) was significantly correlated with sexual health risk behavior \n(dependent variable) (B = 1.63; S.E. = .39, p < .001). Last, after adding perceived \ndiscrimination as a mediator, the relationship between educational attainment \n(independent) and sexual health risk behavior (dependent) was reduced to no \nsignificance (p > 05; p = .28). Therefore, most of the relationship between educational \nattainment and sexual health risk behavior is explained through the indirect pathway \ninvolving perceived discrimination. \nHypothesis 4: Perceived discrimination will be positively correlated with sexual health \nrisk behaviors \nResults indicated a statistically significant association between perception of \ndiscrimination and sexual health risk behaviors (B = 1.63; S.E. = .39, p < .001). The \nresults did support the hypothesis outcome. \nHypothesis 5: Engagement in HIV preventive practices will modify the perceived \ndiscrimination-sexual health risk behaviors relationship \n35 \nControlling for HIV status, a moderation effect was tested to determine if the \nrelationship between perceived discrimination and sexual health risk behaviors depends \non engagement in HIV preventive practice. To determine the possible moderator effect, \na product term was created with perceived discrimination multiplied by engagement in \nHIV preventive practices. The findings indicate that perceived discrimination (B = 1.63; \nS.E. = .39, p < .001) was positively correlated with sexual health risk behaviors. And \nengagement in HIV Preventive Practices moderated the perceived discrimination sexual \nhealth risk behavior (B = -1.50; S.E. = .33, p < .001).  \nThe pathways added to the modified model were also significant. The results of \nthis model indicate there is an association between age and HIV preventive practices (B= \n-.14; S.E. = .01, p < .001). Being older than age 50 was associated with the least \nengagement in HIV preventive practices. Other findings showed that there is an \nassociation between sexual orientation and engagement in HIV preventive practices \n(B = -.26; S.E. = .03, p < .001). In terms of HIV status, there was correlation between \nHIV status and perceived discrimination (B = .10; S.E. = .01, p < .001). Finally, a \nrelationship between HIV status and engagement in HIV preventive practices was \nsignificant (B = 0.06; S.E. = .01, p < .001). \n36 \nCHAPTER IV \nDISCUSSION\nFew studies have examined how perceived discrimination could impact sexual \nhealth risk behaviors, specifically for African American gay and bisexual men. Thus, the \npurpose of this study was to examine if psychosocial variables, such as perceived \ndiscrimination and engagement in HIV preventive practices are associated with \nengagement in sexual health risk behaviors. A comprehensive review of the literature \nwas completed and a hypothesized model was developed and tested to explore the \ncomplex nature of how perceived discrimination impacts engagement in sexual health \nrisk behaviors. The results of this study are reviewed and discussed below. \nHypothesis 1: There Will Be A Relationship Between Sexual Orientation (0 = gay; \n1 = bisexual) and Perceived discrimination \nThe results did not support an association between sexual orientation and \nperceived discrimination. This differs from results of previous research that indicate \nthere is a correlation between one’s sexual orientation and their perception of \ndiscrimination (Herek et al., 1999). One factor that could be influencing the lack of a \nsignificant finding is the measurement of perceived discrimination. As measured \ncurrently, participants are asked to determine if they perceived a discriminatory act \nbased exclusively on their sexual orientation. However, the interaction between race \nand gender expression could also be impacting the perception of discrimination. Not \nincluding the intersectionality of race, gender expression, and sexual orientation in the\n37 \nmeasurement of perceived discrimination could lead to a skewed understanding of \ndiscrimination. More recent studies examining discrimination point to the fact that \nidentities are not believed to be discrete or separable from another (Bostwick et al., 2014; \nBowleg, 2008; Stirratt, Meyer, Ouellette, & Gara, 2008). Thus, the possible measurement \nerror stemming from an attempt to isolate sexual orientation from participants’ racial \nidentity and gender expression experiences is believed to be impacting the insignificant \nfinding in this study. \nResearch examining the effectiveness of the commonly used Everyday \nDiscrimination Scale found distinctive patterns of experiences of discrimination for \nracial minorities and sexual minorities (Clark, Coleman, & Novak 2004; Jefferson, \n2014). Findings suggest that both minority groups frequently reported verbal \naggression, impolite treatment, being the focus of negative opinions (Jefferson, 2014). \nHowever, individuals of color exclusively endorsed statements like “people act afraid \nof you” and “people think you are not as good” (Jefferson, 2014). Additionally, a \npreviously mentioned study found that compared to their White counterparts, Queer \nPeople of Color (QPOC) were more likely to report experiencing discrimination based \non race, gender, and/or sexual orientation (Bostwick et al., 2014). This study examined \ndiscrimination by utilizing the Experiences of Discrimination scales (Krieger et al., \n2005). In this study, participants were asked six Likert scale questions to determine if \ndiscriminatory events happened in health care, societal interactions, and employment, \nbecause of their racial identity, ethic identity, sexual orientation, or binary stated gender \n(Krieger et al., 2005). Additionally, variables were created measuring if participants \n38 \nreported experiencing discrimination based on racial or ethnic, sexual orientation, or \ngender discrimination alone or a combination of these identities (Bostwick et al., 2014). \nMeasuring discrimination by including intersectionality provided an in-depth \nunderstanding of how sexual orientation discrimination is impacted by race and gender \n(Bostwick et al., 2014). \nBoth previously mentioned studies focused on participants’ reporting experiences \nof discrimination, while the current study focuses on the perception of discrimination. \nTherefore, future research is needed in establishing a scale or latent variable that \nincorporates intersectionality in measuring perceived discrimination. Specifically, for \nAfrican American gay and bisexual men, intersectionality between race, sexual \norientation, and gender expression should be included. Research has noted that non-\ngender conforming gay or bisexual men, whose physical sex may be different than their \nexpressed gender, also experience discrimination due to societal perceptions of their \ngender (Kattari & Hasche, 2016; Van, Bos, Kuyper, Overbeek, & Sandfort, 2016). \nThus, in measuring the perception of discrimination among African American gay and \nbisexual men, gender expression should be included in future studies. Additionally, it is \nsuggested that future research continues to psychometrically construct perceived \ndiscrimination similar to the Bostwick et al., 2014 study, while also including questions \nthat determine how identity salience impact the perception of discrimination. For \nexample, perceived discrimination can be determined by using a question from the \nEveryday Discrimination Scale (Clark et al., 2004) such as “Do people act as if they are \nafraid of you?” If a participant says yes to this question, a subsequent question could be\n39 \n“Do people act as if they are afraid of you because of your race, sexual orientation, \ngender expression or a combination of your identities?” \nHypothesis 2: Educational Attainment Will Modify The Sexual Orientation-\nPerceived Discrimination Relationship \nResults did not support educational attainment being a moderator for the sexual \norientation-perceived discrimination relationship. This result differs from previous \nresearch that indicates educational attainment determines under what conditions the \nrelationship between an individual’s sexual orientation and one’s perception of \ndiscrimination would differ (Zhang et al., 2012; Broman et al., 2000). There are two \nfactors that could be impacting this statistically insignificant outcome. First, educational \nattainment, as measured by a single item in this study, might not be fully measuring what \nis derived from obtaining education. Educational levels are often used as a proxy for the \ncomponents of skills obtained during the education process (Barro & Lee, 2013). Thus, \nusing educational attainment as a proxy increases the odds of measurement error \noccurring. \nIn general, education changes how individuals see and interact with their \nenvironments (McGlynn, 2012). Research supports that obtaining advanced education \ncan: (a) increase contact with diverse populations and ideas, and (b) increase critical and \nanalytical thinking skills (McGlynn, 2012). It is believed that the benefit of obtaining \neducation could moderate the sexual orientation-perceived discrimination relationship. \nSpecifically, it is believed that the increased ability of critical and analytical thinking \nskills could enhance cognitive appraisal, which is often used in attributing meaning to \n40 \ndiscriminatory events. Cognitive appraisal is defined as the evaluative lenses that \nindividuals utilize to make meaning of events that include an assessment of resources \nneeded to manage stressful situations (Yap & Tong, 2009; Folkman, Lazarus, Dunkel-\nSchetter, DeLongis, & Gruen, R. J., 1986). Thus, to better explore the possible \nmoderation qualities of educational attainment, future research should focus on the \nfollowing: (a) Use measures that examine how the appraisal process might differ based \non educational attainment levels; in essence do appraisal abilities increase as educational \nattainment increases? (b) Continue to build up research that suggests that cognitive \nappraisal impacts the perception of discrimination (Mays, Cochran, & Barnes, 2007). \nAnd (c) as previously discussed, education is often used a proxy for the components of \nskills obtained during the education process (Barro & Lee, 2013). Thus, future studies \nare encouraged to measure and use the underlying skills and benefits obtained from \neducation as variables, opposed to using education levels as a proxy. To obtain this \ninformation, it is suggested that an educational attainment variable be created that \nconcurrently taps into appraisal abilities at each educational level. \nAlthough education attainment was not a moderator in this study, a direct \nrelationship between educational attainment and perceived discrimination was \nstatistically significant. There are mixed findings on the relationship between \neducational attainment and perceived discrimination (Abramson, Hashemi, & Sánchez-\nJankowski, 2015; Reilly et al., 2015). Results from the current study suggest that \nparticipants with the least amount of education perceived the most discrimination. This\n41 \nresult is congruent with findings about the association between perceived discrimination \nand educational attainment among African American and LGBT populations (Reilly et \nal., 2015; Hausmann, Leslie Jeong, Kwonho, Bost, Ibrahim, & Said, 2008). Other studies \nsuggest as educational attainment increases, perceived discrimination increases \n(Abramson et al, 2015). It is believed that this incongruence in findings between the \neducational attainment-perceived discrimination relationship is still based on the \npossibility that educational attainment (increased appraisal ability) is moderating the \nidentity-perceived (i.e., sexual orientation) discrimination relationship. \nHypothesis 3: Perceived Discrimination Will Mediate The Educational \nAttainment-Sexual Health Risk Behavior Relationship \nResults showed that perceived discrimination mediated the relationship between \neducational attainment and sexual health-risk behavior. This result supports previous \nresearch that has demonstrated perceived discrimination’s meditational proprieties in \ndirect relationships within both racial and LGBT research (Fuller-Rowell, Curtis, El-\nSheikh, Duke, Ryff, & Zgierska, 2017; Matthews, Li, Aranda, Torres, Vargas, & \nConrad, 2014; Wagner, Bogart, Galvan, Banks, & Klein, 2012). One study found that \nperceived discrimination mediates the relationship between sexual orientation and \ndepression for LGBT youth (Almeida, Johnson, Corliss, Molnar, & Azrael, 2009). \nAnother study suggests that perceived discrimination mediates the relationship between \nadult attachment style and depression for gay men (Zakalik &Wei, 2006). \nOn the basis of this finding, continued research is needed to determine how \nperceived discrimination might mediate the relationship between educational attainment\n42 \nand specific health risk behaviors individually (i.e., having multiple sexual partners, having \nsex under the influence of substances, and being previously diagnosed with an STI). \nAdditionally, research is needed to explore if perceived discrimination still \nmediates the educational attainment-perceived discrimination relationship within the \ncontext of the biopsychosocial theory. The biopsychosocial theory is based on the idea \nthat health and illness are determined by interactions between biological, psychological, \nand social factors (Engle, 1978; Borrell-Carrió, Suchman, & Epstein, 2004). The \nmediation effect observed in this study focuses primarily on social and psychological \naspects of the biopsychosocial model. Thus, future research is encouraged to examine if \nthe biological factors of perceived discrimination, such as increased cortisol (Zeiders, \nDoane, & Roosa, 2012) might also be impacting the educational attainment-sexual \nhealth risk relationship. \nHypothesis 4: Perceived Discrimination Will Be Positively Correlated With \nSexual Health Risk Behaviors\nThe hypothesized positive relationship between perceived discrimination and \nsexual health risk behaviors was supported. This result supports previous research that \nindicates perceived discrimination impacts engagement in sexual health risk behaviors \n(Frye et al., 2014; Reilly et al., 2015). Meyer’s minority stress model is useful in \nexplaining the relationship between perceived discrimination and sexual health risk \nbehaviors (Meyer, 2003). The model proposes that negative health outcomes faced by \nLGBQ populations can be explained as a result of chronic experiences of minority stress \nand distal and proximal experiences of discrimination (Meyer, 2003). Minority stress is \n43 \ndescribed as excess stress that individuals from stigmatized social groups are exposed to \nas a result of a hostile societal view toward that minority status (Meyer, 2003; Brooks, \n1981; Meyer, 1995). Within the context of this study, experiences of minority stressors \nsuch as perceived discrimination can increase the likelihood of engaging in sexual health \nrisk behaviors (Dentato, 2012; Diaz, Bein, & Ayala, 2006). \nFuture research is encouraged in utilizing a SEM latent growth model that is \nbased on the minority stress model. Latent growth models are used to estimate growth \nover time (Kline, 2015). Previous research has suggested that years of chronic minority \nstress have a direct correlation on the perception of discrimination and subsequent sexual \nhealth risk behaviors (Dentato, 2012). Thus, using latent growth modeling would allow \nfor additional exploration of how minority stress and discrimination could impact sexual \nhealth risk behaviors over time. This modeling would allow examination of how \nperceived discrimination might also be predictive of individual sexual health risk factors \n(i.e., having multiple sexual partners, having sex under the influence of substances, and \nbeing previously diagnosed with an STI) over time. \nHypothesis 5: Engagement in HIV Preventive Practices Will Modify The Perceived \nDiscrimination-Sexual Health Risk Behaviors Relationship \nHypothesis five proposed that engagement in HIV preventive practices would \nmodify the perceived discrimination-sexual health risk behavior relationship. Results \nsupported this hypothesis, with engagement in HIV preventive practices weakening the \nassociation between perceived discrimination and sexual health risk behaviors. This \nfinding supports previous research that indicates discrimination and social biases can \n44 \nimpact HIV prevention and subsequent engagement in sexual health risk behaviors \n(Brooks, Etzel, Hinojos, Henry, & Mario Perez, 2005). \nHowever, as previously discussed, while there are mixed results, research has \ndemonstrated that knowledge of HIV preventive practices alone does not decrease sexual \nrisk behaviors (Hoehn, FitzGerald, Bhatt, Robinson, Lippe, & Reed, 2016; Noroozinejad, \net al., 2013; Salgado et al., 1996). One particular study examined if high levels of HIV \npreventive knowledge decreased partaking in sexual risk behaviors (Hoehn et al., 2016). \nThe results suggested that knowledge of HIV preventive practices alone was not \nsufficient in changing sexual practices (Hoehn et al., 2016). Best Practices in HIV \nPrevention (2014), a document created by the National LGBT Health and Education \nCenter, suggests that HIV prevention programs that focus on increasing preventive \nknowledge without including psychosocial factors are likely less effective. \nThe literature also presents several other factors that are needed in conjunction \nwith knowledge of HIV preventive practices to decrease engagement in sexual health \nrisk behaviors. Some of these factors include (a) focusing on the resilience of minority \npopulations; (b) including the impact of life-long psychosocial stressors such as \ndiscrimination, homophobia and stigma; (c) helping individuals tackle environmental \nbarriers that hinder the utilization of HIV prevention; (c) empowering and equipping \ncommunities to support healthy sexual discussions; and (e) helping individuals evaluate \nthe risk of making assumptions about their partner(s) HIV status (Melendez, Zepeda, \nSamaniego, Chakravarty, & Alaniz, 2013; Mustanski, Garofalo, Herrick, & Donenberg, \n45 \n2007; Rotheram-Borus, Swendeman, Flannery, Rice, Adamson & Ingram, 2009; Brooks, \net al., 2005). \nAs previously discussed, HIV preventive efforts often focus on increasing \nknowledge and decreasing behavior. However, based on the findings of this study, it is \nimportant to continue exploring how the internal processes underlying discrimination \nand utilization of HIV preventive practices together could decrease sexual health risk \nbehaviors. Adapting this perspective means attempting to help individuals make \nmeaningful changes to the internal process that affect engagement in sexual health \nbehaviors. Therefore, future research is encouraged to continue exploring how HIV \npreventive practices are impacting the internal processes affecting the perceived \ndiscrimination-sexual health risk behavior relationship. Additionally, future research is \nencouraged to continue exploring if HIV preventive practices moderate the relationship \nbetween other psychosocial factors (i.e., stigma, internalized homophobia, and \nresiliency) and sexual health risk behaviors. \nIt is also interesting to note that age impacted the utilization of HIV preventive \npractices. Specifically, utilization of HIV preventive practices are most associated with \nparticipants ages 20-44 in this study. Participants who are between 18-24 are less likely \nto engage in HIV preventive practices compared to participants ages 20-44. However, \nthe 18-24 group is still more likely to engage in HIV preventive practices than \nparticipants who are above age 50. These findings are congruent with previous research \nfindings (CDC, 2017b). The CDC presents that older individuals encounter the same risk \nof HIV infection as younger individuals (CDC, 2017b). However, older individuals may\n46 \nbelieve they are no longer at risk for HIV and could mistake HIV symptoms for those of \nnormal aging, not considering HIV as a possible cause (CDC, 2017b). \nResults also indicated bisexual participants reported less engagement in HIV \npreventive practices. There are few studies that examine HIV preventive practices and \nsexual health risk behaviors of bisexual men. However, one study examining risk factors \namong heterosexual and LGB youth found that bisexual males were more likely to report \na higher number of sexual partners, and earlier ages of sexual debut (Everett, Schnarrs, \nRosario, Garofalo, & Mustanski, 2013). Added to the complexity of this finding is the \npossible correlation between HIV preventive practices used by bisexual men with men \nand women. Previous research suggests that (a) the frequencies of HIV preventive \npractices are different with male and female partners and (b) HIV preventive practices \nand unsafe sexual behaviors with female partners might also be correlated to bisexual \nmen practices with male partners (Friedman, Wei, Klem, Silvestre, Markovic, 2014; \nHarawa et al., 2014; Greco, Silca, Merchan-hamann, Jeronymo, Andrade, & Greco, \n2007). Therefore, the diversity of behavior among bisexual participants could be \nimpacting the measurement and reports of engagement in HIV preventive practices. \nIn addition, results suggested that there is a correlation between HIV status and \nthe perception of discrimination. Particularly, having an HIV-positive status is \nassociated with increased perception of discrimination. Two factors are believed to \ninfluence this finding. As previously stated in this study, identity and identity-salience \nimpacts how individuals view themselves, other identity roles, and others within their \nenvironments (Hogg, Terry, & White, 1995). Salience of an identity also determines \n47 \nhow probable identities will be activated across a variety of situations (Hogg et al., \n1995). A diagnosis of HIV can lead to the formation of a stigmatized chronic illness \nidentity that can become salient. According to Baumgartner and Niemi (2013), being \ndiagnosed with HIV becomes a part of that individual’s self-identity. This newly formed \nidentity, in turn, is believed to shape the perception of discrimination. Research suggests \nthat African Americans who are HIV-positive experience frequent stigma, discrimination, \nand social stress related to how others perceive their HIV status. These negative \nexperiences increase the perception of subsequent stigmatization (Williamson, Mahmood, \nKuhn, Thames, & Health, 2017). These findings, in turn, support an increased perception \nof discrimination because of the identity salience or impact of an HIV-positive diagnosis \nfor participants who are HIV positive. \nA second factor is also believed to impact the perception of discrimination for \nAfrican American HIV-positive gay and bisexual men. Continuing with the previous \nrationale that having an HIV-positive status can become a chronic illness identity, it is \nbelieved that HIV status interacts with other marginalized identities (Baumgartner & \nNiemi, 2013). This interaction or intersectionality between race, sexual orientation, and \npositive HIV status could also impact the perception of discrimination. African \nAmerican HIV-positive gay and bisexual men could encounter discrimination and \nhomophobia from the larger African American community, because of skewed societal \npairing of sexual orientation and HIV infection. Historically, within the African \nAmerican community, HIV infection was attributed to African American gay and \nbisexual men. During the late 1900s and early 2000s, the belief persisted that gay, \n48 \nbisexual men, or “down low men” were responsible for high rates of HIV infection \namong African American heterosexual women (Millett, Malebranche, Mason, & Spikes, \n2005). While this stereotypical belief has been disproven (Millett et al., 2005), these \nskewed negative beliefs could still impact the perception of discrimination and stigma by \nparticipants in this study. \nPrevious research suggests that individuals who are HIV positive are more likely \nto engage in HIV preventive practices than individuals who a HIV negative (Moskowitz \n& Seal, 2001; Kalichman et al., 2016). This study presents similar finding: There is a \nrelationship between being HIV positive and engaging in HIV preventive practices. One \npossible factor underlying this finding is that participants who are HIV positive face \ndifferent consequences when they do not engage in HIV preventive practices. For \nexample, there can be legal ramifications for not informing sexual partners of their HIV \nstatus (Kalichman, et al., 2016). Thus, the risks of engaging in sexual health risk behaviors \nthat can lead to HIV infection are greater for participants who are HIV positive. \nAs previously discussed, receiving an HIV-positive diagnosis can create an HIV-\nrelated chronic illness identity. Research proposes that having this identity can impact \nsexual behaviors, partner selection, and interpersonal communication about HIV status \n(Kalichman et al., 2016). Within the present study, it is believed that this chronic illness \nidentity also underlies an increased likelihood of engaging in HIV preventive practices.\nFuture research is needed to explore if knowledge of higher rates of HIV \ninfection, among African American gay and bisexual men, could be negatively \nimpacting engagement in HIV preventive practices. As previously mentioned, recent\n49 \nstatistics published by the CDC (2017a) reported that if HIV diagnosis persists, the \nlifetime risk for HIV infection among African American gay and bisexual men is one in \ntwo. This report presents a possible bleak outcome for African American gay and bisexual \nmen. Research also indicates that African American gay and bisexual men are more likely \nto have Black sexual partners (Koblin et al., 2013). Therefore, this possible bleak outcome \npaired with (a) individuals living longer with HIV (CDC, 2016) and (b) the smaller \nexclusive dating selection could decrease engagement in HIV preventive practices for \nAfrican American gay and bisexual men who are HIV negative. This could be based on  \nan assumed probability that HIV infection is likely. Thus, future research is needed to \nexplore these complex relationships. \nLimitations \nBefore discussing the implications of the study, it is important to recognize the \nlimitations. One limitation of this study is that the data was collected cross-sectional. \nWith cross-sectional data, only associated relationships can be obtained, but casual \ninferences cannot be made. Future longitudinal cohort research, that measures \ndiscrimination as a predictor of sexual health risk behavior, could provide further \nunderstanding of this topic. A longitudinal study can determine if continued perceived \ndiscrimination still impacts or increases sexual health risk behaviors consistently. \nResearch studies also suggest that longitudinal research is needed to understand the \nimpact of lifetime discrimination, psychosocial, stressors on subsequent health outcomes \n(Noh & Kaspar, 2003). \nAnother limitation is limited generalizability. This study is not generalizable to \n50 \nAfrican American gay and bisexual men who live in rural areas, as the data was \ncollected in metropolitan cities. The literature presents several differences among urban \nand rural gay and bisexual men (Peterson & Jones, 2009). Other factors that narrow \ngeneralizability are that the sample is comprised of more educated participants and that a \nlarge number of the participants identified as gay. Additionally, the majority of the \nsample reported being tested for HIV. This limits the generalization to African American \ngay and bisexual men who have been previously tested for HIV. \nAn additional limitation centers on the face validity of the engagement in HIV \npreventive practices. According to the theory on planned behavior there are distinct \ndifferences between having knowledge and engaging in preventive behavior (Ajzen, \n1985). Therefore, based on the theory of planned behavior, removing the following items \nfrom the original five-item engagement in HIV Preventive practices variable: (a) “having \nparticipated in an HIV preventive session in a one-on-one setting; and (b) “having \nparticipated in an HIV preventive session in a group setting”, potentially changed the \nvariable from an engagement-based variable to a knowledge-based variable. These two \nitems were removed due to low reliability of the original five item variable. Thus, future \nresearch is needed in constructing an engagement-based HIV preventive practices \nvariable. Another limitation for the engagement in HIV preventive practices is the low \nCronbach’s alpha. Cronbach’s alpha is a reliability measurement. Cronbach’s alpha \nmeasures internal consistency, essentially how closely related questions are in measuring \nan overall construct. Scores close to or higher than .80 indicate good internal consistency \n(Garson, 2013; Tavakol & Dennick, 2011). Scores .70 or higher are considered \n51 \nacceptable (Garson, 2013; Tavakol & Dennick, 2011). The engagement in HIV \npreventive practices obtained a Cronbach’s alpha of .42, indicating low internal \nconsistency. However, this can be attributed to the fact that alpha is sensitive to the \nnumber of questions and the type of questions utilized. Garson (2013) indicates that low \nalpha can occur when there are few items describing a scale or factor. Low alpha can \nalso occur when items are dichotomous, compared to Likert-scale or continuous items. \nThus, the low alpha obtained by the engagement in HIV preventive practice could have \noccurred because of the low number of questions and dichotomous questions used. \nFuture research constructing an HIV preventive construct with good internal consistency \nis needed. \nThe perceived discrimination construct received an alpha of .60, which is closer \nto the acceptable range. The measurement of discrimination omits possible perceived \ndiscrimination occurring due to other minority status, thus possibly impacting the \ninternal consistency of the item. Only sexual orientation discrimination was measured in \nthis study. However, racial discrimination, and gender expression based discrimination \ncould also impact the perception of sexual orientation discrimination. Future research is \nneeded in how QPOC intersecting identities and gender expression impact the perception \nof discrimination. Other researchers have noted the need for utilizing intersectionality in \nmeasuring discrimination constructs (Seaton et al.,2010; Dentato, 2012). \nAdditionally, having path coefficient greater than one suggest that there could be \nmulticollinearity (Jöreskog, 1999). There are mixed findings on how multicollinearity \nmay impact SEM, as some studies have found legitimate times that multicollinearity has \n52 \noccurred and not biased estimated coefficients (Grewal et al., 2004; Deegan, 1978; \nJöreskog, 1999;). Grewal et al., (2004) suggest that multicollinearity can be affected by \n(a) sample size, with smaller sample sizes being more likely to encounter \nmulticollinearity, and (b) and when variable composite reliability is low. Thus, it is \nbelieved that the composite reliability of perceived discrimination and engagement in \nHIV preventive practices could be impacting multicollinearity. As previously stated, \nfuture research is needed in creating perceived discrimination and engagement in HIV \npreventive practices variables with greater internal consistency. \nFinally, due to the complex inclusion and exclusion criteria of the NHBS \ninterview survey, other factors included in the NHBS survey that are believed to increase \nthe risk of HIV among gay and bisexual men were not included in this study. As \nmentioned before, the NHBS utilizes a structure interview formation. Some questions \nhad inclusion/exclusion criteria for additional questions (therefore, participants who \nanswer “no” to the original pre-request questions are directed to another set of \nquestions). Sexual health risk behaviors that are not easily assessed without the inclusion \nof causal and or main partners include condomless anal sex, having hepatitis B (HBV), \nand hepatitis C (HCV). These factors are important because the literature suggests they \nincrease the risk of HIV infection. Findings suggest that gay and bisexual men often \nacquire HIV through condomless anal sex (CDC, 2015b) and HBV/HCV infections are \nsimilarly transmitted as HIV (CDC, 2015b). Therefore, future research is needed to \nconstruct a latent sexual health risk behavior variable that includes additional risk \nfactors. Moreover, future research is encouraged to create a multidimensional latent \nsexual health risk variable for African American gay and bisexual men. The suggested \n53 \ndimensions include (a) risk behaviors, (b) biological risk, such as inflammation caused \nby other STIs that increases susceptibility to HIV infection, and (c) psychosocial risk, \nsuch as age of sexual debut. Risk behaviors, such as condomless anal sex and those \nincluded in this study, are frequently used in the literature to measure sexual health risk \nbehaviors. However, there are biological and psychosocial factors that also increase risk \nof HIV infection that are not rooted in behavior (Peterman, Newman, Maddox, Schmitt, \n&, Shiver, 2014). \nFor example, research suggests that syphilis biologically facilitates the \nacquisition and transmission of HIV infection (Mehta, Ghanem, Rompalo, & Erbelding, \n2006; Pathela, Braunstein, Schillinger, Shepard, Sweeney, & Blank, 2011). In terms of \npsychosocial risk factors, things like age of sexual debut, depression, concurrent \npartners, low self-esteem, and low social support have all been examined as factors \npossibly leading to increased HIV infection (Gerbi, Habtemariam, Robnett, Nganwa, & \nTameru, 2012; Ramiro, Teva, Bermúdez, & Buela-Casal, 2013; Beyrer, Baral, Walker, \nWirtz, Johns, & Sifakis, 2010; Pettifor, Straten, Dunbar, Shiboski, & Padian, 2004). \nOverall, each of three factors are associated with HIV infection; however, all uniquely \nattributable to HIV infection. Thus, warranting specific factors within a latent sexual \nhealth risk variable is important. \nRecommendations and Implications \nBased on the results of this study and previous research, the following \nimplications are suggested. There is a necessity for psychological and health scholars \nwho are exploring predictors of sexual health behaviors to take into account psychosocial \nfactors like perceived discrimination. The following research recommendations are made\n54 \nfor those who are exploring the impact of perceived discrimination on sexual health risk \nbehaviors, for African American gay and bisexual men. \nBased on the insignificant relationship between perceived discrimination and \nsexual orientation found in this study, the following recommendations are made. First, \nThe perceived discrimination construct, in this study, measures only sexual orientation \ndiscrimination. However, intersecting minority group membership and identity salience \ncan impact the perception of discrimination; thus, both concepts should be included in \nthe exploration of perceived discrimination (Meyer, 2003; Seaton et al., 2010; Dentato, \n2012). This approach is also suggested over viewing perceived discrimination as a \nbyproduct of behaviors, which is an underlying assumption when the term MSM is used \nin conjunction with discrimination (Wilson & Miyashita, 2016). \nSecond, in the psychological field constructs, scales, and theoretical models are \ncreated to provide in-depth understanding of a phenomenon. The process of creating a \nconstruct or a scale is tedious, but the end result aids in the ability to bring insight to \ncomplex internal processes underlying behavior. Thus, additional recommendations \nbased on this study include continuing to examine sexual health risk behaviors as a latent \nconstruct, as well as utilizing structure equation modeling in examining and comparing \ntheoretical models aiming to explain complex relationships that can lead to HIV \ninfection (Noar & Zimmerman, 2005). \nThe results of this study also have the potential to impact prevention and \nintervention work for mental health providers and health promoters. This study suggests \nthat there are multiple ways for practitioners working with African American gay and \n55 \nbisexual men to intervene on the perceived discrimination-sexual health risk behavior \nrelationship. It is important to first acknowledge ways that mental health providers can \naddress perceived discrimination in counseling. \nGiven that the study found a relationship between perceived discrimination and \nsexual health risk behaviors, mental health and health providers can intervene in this \ndetrimental relationship by (a) assessing the client’s history for discriminatory \nvictimization and perceptions of discrimination by utilizing the Every Day \ndiscrimination scale (Clark et al., 2004) or other discrimination scales (Atkins, 2014), \nand (b) assessing for the impact of perceived discrimination on sexual health risk \nbehaviors. Specifically, by seeking to understand how internalized perceived \ndiscrimination could be impacting engagement in sexual health risk behaviors.  \nNo overall significant difference was found in the perception of sexual \norientation discrimination between African American gay and bisexual men. However, \nprevious literature still suggests that bisexual individuals may perceive the source and \ntypes of discrimination differently than their gay male counterparts (Klesse, 2011). For \nexample, research suggests that bisexual individuals may be faced with challenges of the \nvalidity of bisexuality as a sexual orientation (Klesse, 2011; Mulick & Wright, 2002; \nKollen, 2013). Previous research also suggests that bisexual individuals are less likely to \nfeel included in the LGBT community (Mulick & Wright, 2007). Additionally, the \nsources of discrimination can be different for African American bisexual men than for \ntheir gay counterparts. Therefore, it is encouraged that mental health and health \n56 \nproviders validate bisexuality as a sexual orientation, and explore the unique perception \nof discrimination that African American bisexual men can have. \nGiven that participants reported perceived discrimination due to their sexual \norientation and that the perception of discrimination also impacts the perception of \nsafety, mental health and health providers should acknowledge ways that safety might be \nthreatened in the provider-client relationship. Practitioner biases toward African \nAmerican gay and bisexual men can interfere with clients’ perceived safety. These \nbiases limit the successfulness of weakening the perceived discrimination-sexual health \nrisk behavior relationship. In the LGB counseling guidelines published by the American \nPsychological Association, it states, “psychologists need to acknowledge the prevalence \nand impact of HIV among LGB populations” (2011, p. 23). Additionally, the guidelines \nstate that mental health providers should “avoid any assumptions pertaining to a client’s \nHIV status based on sexual orientation or other demographic characteristics” (2011, p. \n24). Thus, for practitioners working with this population, automatically assuming that \nAfrican American gay and bisexual men are HIV positive can increase their perception \nof discrimination. In addition, this practitioner assumption decreases the perception of \ninterpersonal safety within the therapeutic relationship. Finally, negative implicit and \nexplicit biases about African American gay and bisexual men can also undermine the \neffectiveness of the provider-client relationship. Therefore, mental health and health \nproviders are encouraged to engage in self-exploration of biases. The providers should \nchallenge their negative implicit and explicit biases that can detrimentally decease \nopportunities to engage in meaningful conversations about HIV prevention.\n57 \nRelated specifically to HIV prevention efforts, the following implications are \nmade. It is encouraged that future behavioral health HIV prevention programs include \nways of decreasing discrimination and other detrimental psychosocial factors, while also \nincreasing knowledge of HIV preventive practices. One of the findings of this study \nsuggests that the interaction between perceived discrimination and engagement in HIV \npreventive practices could be related to a decrease in sexual health risk behaviors. \nTherefore, it is suggested that HIV prevention programs include intervention strategies \nthat help participants change the psychosocial-based internal process that impacts sexual \nhealth risk behaviors. \nPrevious research has demonstrated consistent support for the effectiveness of \ndecreasing sexual health risk behaviors utilizing group and community-level \ninterventions among gay and bisexual men (Lorimer, Kidd, Lawrence, McPherson, \nCayless, & Cornish, 2013). Additionally, research determined that interventions are most \neffective when delivered by trained professionals who utilize theory-based interventions \n(Lorimer, 2013; Crepaz et al., 2006). Building upon these research findings, it is \nsuggested that HIV prevention programs create group interventions that are led by \ninterdisciplinary care teams. Utilizing a care team, treatment models would allow for \nholistic-focused interventions needed in decreasing the impact of discrimination on \nsexual health risk behaviors. Finally, based on previously discussed findings, African \nAmerican bisexual men need HIV prevention interventions addressing their specific risk \nneeds.\n58 \nCHAPTER V\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nThis study examined if psychosocial variables like perceived discrimination, \neducational attainment, and HIV preventive practices impact engagement in sexual \nhealth risk behaviors for African American gay and bisexual men. The study explored \nhow sexual orientation discrimination might be different for African American gay men, \ncompared to their bisexual counterparts. Major findings of the originally proposed \nhypothesis indicated that perceived discrimination mediated the educational attainment-\nsexual health risk behavior relationship, while controlling for age. Findings also \nindicated that perceived discrimination increased the likelihood of engaging in sexual \nhealth risk behaviors. Additionally, it was found that engaging in HIV preventive \npractices weakened the association between perceived discrimination and sexual health \nrisk behaviors. \nSeveral limitations existed in the study. First, the study was cross sectional; thus, \ninferences about causality are not possible. Second, generalizability is limited. \nGeneralizability is limited to African American gay and bisexual men who live in \nmetropolitan cities. Third, the engagement in HIV preventive practices construct \nobtained a low Cronbach’s alpha (.43). However, this is believed to be impacted by \nhaving a small number of dichotomous questions. Alpha is a better source of reliability \nwhen there are more questions, using Likert scale measurements. Fourth, sexual \norientation discrimination is measured in this study. However, other marginalized \n59 \nidentities could be impacting the perception of discrimination for participants. The finial \nlimitation discussed is that other factors associated with HIV infection among gay and \nbisexual men were not included, due to the complex nature of the NHBS interview. \nOverall, this research study highlights the importance of exploring how \npsychosocial factors impact the perception of discrimination and the possible subsequent \nengagement in sexual health risk behaviors. Acknowledgement of how perceived \ndiscrimination impacts engagement in sexual health risk behaviors is important in \ndeveloping future research studies. The results of this study also have practical \nimplications for developing new HIV preventive efforts and mental health interventions.\n60 \nREFERENCES\nAbramson, C.

    "abstract": "African American gay and bisexual men are members of marginalized groups that have historically faced persecution and discrimination. Although there is a well-documented relationship between discrimination and engagement in health risk behaviors, fewer studies have explored how the perception of discrimination among African American gay and bisexual men might be predictive of engagement in sexual health risk behaviors. The purpose of this study was to explore how psychosocial variables, such as perceived discrimination and education attainment, could affect engagement in sexual health risk behaviors. This study also explored relationships between perceived sexual orientation discrimination and health risk behaviors, while examining educational attainment and knowledge of HIV preventive practices as moderators. \n\nParticipants in this study included 3,916 African American gay and bisexual men. Utilizing structural equation modeling, the proposed hypothesized model obtained good fit x2 (N = 3,916, df = 24) = 125.54, p > .05; CFI = .94; TLI = .89; RMSEA = .033. Results indicated perceived discrimination mediated the educational attainment-sexual health risk behavior relationship. Additionally, perceived discrimination increased the likelihood of engaging in sexual health risk behaviors. Engagement in HIV preventive practices was found to weaken the association between perceived discrimination and sexual health risk behaviors. Additional results are discussed based on future research implications and future preventive programming",
