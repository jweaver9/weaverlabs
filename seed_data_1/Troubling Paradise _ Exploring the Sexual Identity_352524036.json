All rights reserved.   iv  Abstract TROUBLING PARADISE: EXPLORING THE SEXUAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCES OF SAME-GENDER LOVING WEST INDIANS by Nicole A. J. Christian The Caribbean holds an international reputation of culturally sanctioned homophobia, which creates implications for the lived experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. However, minimal to no empirical attention has been dedicated to the sexual identity development of members of this population. The goal of this dissertation study was therefore to examine the lived experiences that inform the sexual identity development of Anglophone West Indians. Participants who identified as West Indian and same-gender loving were recruited for this study. A general qualitative study which utilized ethnographic interviewing during two semi-structured interviews was employed. Eleven same-gender loving West Indians from four different Caribbean islands (Antigua, Barbados, Guyana, and Jamaica) participated in this study. Findings suggest that the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians is complex and nuanced, and influenced by their islands’ strongly held colonial values. Participants identified that social institutions coalesce to convey powerful homonegative messages, which informed their challenges with self-acceptance and decisions to conceal their sexual identity. Participants’ self-acceptance, feelings of belonging, and sense of agency in navigating homonegative societies were engendered by experiences with individuals and institutions that affirm their same-gender loving identities. Lastly, participants’ experiences with internalized homophobia and self-disclosure of their sexual identities are contextual, influenced by feelings of physical and psychological safety. Implications for counselor education, counseling practices and future research have been provided.     v  Keywords: sexual identity development, same-gender loving West Indians, LGBTQ Caribbean         vi  Acknowledgments The words on this page could never reflect the immense gratitude in my heart to those who have helped me get here, but I will do my best.

While the 19th century marked the emancipation from slavery in the region’s history, fragments of European colonialism remain present that directly impact the lives of persons whose sexual orientation transgress the norm of heterosexuality (Couzens, Mahoney, & Wilkinson, 2017; Ghisyawan, 2016). The term sexual identity, often used interchangeably with the term sexuality, encompasses a person’s emotional, romantic, and sexual attractions to others, and the labels used to describe it are vast (Jourian, 2015; Saven-Williams, 2005). For the purposes of this discussion, the term same-gender loving will be used to denote persons whose sexual orientations and identity involve the emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attraction to persons of the same sex/gender (Jourian, 2015). The culturally affirming term, same-gender loving, emerged during the 1990s as an Afrocentric alternative to terms such as gay and lesbian and is widely used within Black communities (Jourian, 2015). Utilizing the term same-gender loving within this work also serves to acknowledge and honor the fluidity of sexual identity and diversity of sexual identities. The stigma and widespread discrimination against same-gender loving West Indians have been well documented in existing legislation, the media, and cultural expressions (Couzens et al., 2017; Cowell & Saunders, 2011; West & Cowell, 2015). Yet, the interpersonal and intrapersonal experiences of same-gender loving West Indians as they come to understand and accept their  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        2    identities as same-gender loving, (hereafter referred to as sexual identity development) remains significantly less documented. The limited published peer-reviewed psychological research on sexual identity and homophobia in the West Indies reflects the societies of the larger former British colonies, leaving smaller Caribbean nations excluded from the discourse on the politics of sexuality and identity in a post-colonial Caribbean context (Couzens et al., 2017).   Counselors and other helping professionals currently operate at a disadvantage of limited contextual information when working to meet the needs of same-gender loving West Indians under their care, particularly as it relates to sexual identity. Counselors rely solely on existing research and theoretical frameworks that are reflective of and normed on populations and societies other than that of their West Indian clients. These omit the critical roles of social and cultural context in the identity development process.  Utilizing the ethnographic interview, I explored in depth the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians by centering culture and social context. Specifically, this study explored participants’ interpersonal and intrapersonal experiences in relation to their sexual identity; relationships with social structures (i.e., family, academic, employment, healthcare, religious institutions) and how the intersection of participants’ other identities (i.e., race/complexion, religion, social class/socioeconomic status, religion) influenced their sexual identity development experiences. Eleven same-gender loving West Indians from four Caribbean islands (Antigua, Barbados, Guyana, and Jamaica) participated in this study.  The overarching purpose of this study was to: (1) provide a platform for same-gender loving West Indians to share their sexual identity experiences; (2) create a text and knowledge base that will inform culturally responsive, identity affirmative practices of counselors and other helping professionals who serve same-gender loving West Indians; (3) illuminate the role of  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        3    social and cultural context in the sexual identity development process; and (4) serve as an impetus for social justice advocacy of same-gender loving West Indians. To establish necessary context and rationale for this study, the following problem statement will unpack homonegativity and heterosexism within the Caribbean region. Thereafter, the statement of purpose, research questions, and overview of methodology will be provided. A discussion of the rationale and significance of the research will then serve to underscore the imperative of sexual orientation identity development research of same-gender loving West Indians. This chapter will end with a presentation of the role of the researcher, researcher assumptions, and the definitions of key terminology.  Problem Statement The Caribbean region is comprised of 28 islands and populated by over 35 million people, an estimated 20% of whom identify as some aspect of same-gender loving (Couzens et al., 2017). Despite these estimates, systemic oppression and hostility toward same-gender loving individuals remain a significant cause for concern (Couzens et al., 2017). Much of what has been recorded and understood about homonegativity in the Caribbean, however, primarily reflects Jamaican population and society (Couzens et al., 2017).  Several Caribbean islands, once British colonies, have maintained colonial buggary and gross indecency laws against same-sex sexual behaviors between consenting adults, for which persons are liable to face 15 years in prison in some cases (Braunschweiger, 2018).  Although criminal prosecutions are not enforced, such laws serve in part to justify the oppression of same-gender loving persons, licensed by the absence of laws to protect the human rights and dignity of same-gender loving West Indians (Braunschweiger, 2018).   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        4    A report of the experiences of same-gender loving persons from the small island nations of the Eastern Caribbean indicated that fear of disclosure, marginalization in the workplace, disapproval from family, and being dispelled from church, were significant concerns of same-gender loving West Indians (Braunschweiger, 2018). Participants also reported that it was common for West Indians to enter heterosexual marriages as a form of protection and self-preservation (Braunschweiger, 2018). Having espoused colonial norms and ideals of decency, Caribbean islands have embraced White European principles that have been transposed into laws regarding sexual practices such that monogamy, heterosexual marriage and patrilineal kinship, and anti-sodomy laws, notwithstanding British emancipation, have remained societal norms (Ghisyawan, 2016; Lightfoot, 2015).  The prevalence of homonegativity in public discourse and laws in the Caribbean is embedded in the region’s history. As noted by Couzens and colleagues (2017), the small yet conflicting existent body of literature on the region’s tourism, politics, and laws suggest that there is variance in each Caribbean islands’ tolerance of same-gender loving persons. Existing literature suggests that each island’s unique colonial history is a significant determinant of the countries’ tolerance of same-gender loving persons such that the Spanish and French-speaking islands are less hostile toward homosexuality than the Anglophone islands (Couzens et al., 2017; Kempadoo, 2009). Couzens and colleagues (2017) argued that islands that have maintained a relatively stable British rule and Victorian morality appear to be more homophobic in comparison to islands that were predominantly under the rule of Spain and France. In the lives of same-gender loving West Indians, multiple identities intersect with their West Indian ethnicity to create unique experiences with oppression, as reflected in Intersectionality theory (Shields, 2008). In the Caribbean, religion is one salient identity that  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        5    influences the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. Even though there is no single religion designated to the Caribbean as an entity, existent literature posits that religious discourse plays an integral part in the region’s anti-gay culture, as most opponents cite a Judeo-Christian ideology as the premise of a firm opposition (Cowell & Saunders, 2011; West & Cowell, 2015). One study by Cowell and Saunders (2011), which investigated the determinants of heteronormativity in Jamaica, revealed that religion (particularly Judeo-Christian values) was a primary indicator of heteronormativity. Although the findings of this study specifically reflect Jamaica’s society, it may be argued that it is not isolated.  Social status and skin color also have been shown to influence the ways in which same-gender loving West Indians are exposed to and experience homonegativity. The social hierarchy based on skin-shade, or colorism, is a significant issue embedded in Caribbean societies and culture (Couzens et al., 2017). This practice of colorism ascribes privilege of varying levels and behavioral expectations to light-skinned persons while subjecting dark-skinned persons to prejudicial and discriminatory practices (Couzens et al., 2017). Researchers Couzens and colleagues (2017) found more acceptance of light-skinned same-gender loving St. Lucians than dark-skinned same-gender loving St. Lucians. Also, through advanced levels of education, dark-skinned LGB persons were afforded acceptance that would have otherwise been reserved for light-skinned same-gender loving persons (Couzens et al., 2017). Factors such as skin shade (Couzens et al., 2017), weak or negative familial relationships, disclosure and openness about one’s sexual orientation, and experiences with abuse as a result of sexual orientation (Phillip, 2013; White, Barnaby, Swaby, & Sandfort, 2010) all have been shown to influence psychological health outcomes of same-gender loving West Indians.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        6    Each of the aforementioned factors presents significant implications for the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. The absence of sexual identity development research that reflect the experiences of same-gender West Indians is problematic for two overarching reasons. First, minority stress theory posits that same-gender loving persons experience higher levels of stress as members of a socially stigmatized population, which results in greater psychological distress and propensity for mental illness in comparison to their heterosexual counterparts (Meyer, 2007). Same-gender loving West Indians living or having lived in an oppressive homonegative society are therefore susceptible to higher psychological stress and mental health concerns as they come to understand and accept their identity as same-gender loving. This susceptibility may be exacerbated by intersecting identities such as religion, race/complexion, social/socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and sex (Couzens et al., 2017; Phillip, 2013). Mental health and other helping professionals, and policy-makers lack the necessary knowledge regarding the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians to provide identity-affirming practices and policies that support the well-being of this population. Moreover, this void in empirical research provides mental health and other professionals no evidence-based information on the ways in which same-gender loving West Indians experience resilience and create safe spaces for themselves as they navigate their sexual identity development process.  Second, sexual identity development models provide a useful framework for counselors and other helping professionals to utilize when attempting to conceptualize the experiences, behaviors, and identities of sexual minorities. These models lack important contextual information necessary for providing culturally responsive counseling practices to same-gender loving West Indians. Central to historical and commonly utilized perspective  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        7    of sexual identity development models is the focus on internal conflicts and resolutions that occur as persons recognize and accept themselves as same-gender loving (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005). Such internal conflicts and resolutions, from a developmental perspective, are depicted as a linear progression of ordered, hierarchal stages, as maintained by sexual identity development scholars such as Cass (1979, 1984), McCarn and Fassinger (1996), Savin-Williams (1988), Troiden (1988), and Weinberg, Williams, and Prior (1994). Despite the strengths of these models in providing a useful framework in understanding the developmental process of sexual identity, they were not developed based on the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians living in a post-colonial society.  Moreover, many linear theories and models fall short of accounting for the influence of important contextual factors, such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion (Kenneady & Oswalt, 2014), and the intersection of identities in the sexual identity development process. Therefore, assumptions based on linear developmental models regarding the trajectory and characteristics of sexual identity, such as self-disclosure and naming practices, may not fit precisely with same-gender loving West Indians. An overreliance on these assumptions could potentially minimize or pathologize the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians who do not fit the prescribed characteristics. In the context of this study, utilizing linear developmental models without an understanding of a Caribbean social context, informed by the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, overlooks the complex and nuanced ways in which sexual identity and development intersect with a Caribbean ethnicity, race/complexion, social class, religion, and sex among other salient identities. Modern renderings of sexual identity development, in place of a sequential pattern of development, center various aspects of sexual identity to facilitate a more in-depth and  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        8    comprehensive understanding of persons’ sexual identity development experiences. Such an approach views sexual identity as a process that occurs across the lifespan and unfolds in relation to and influenced by biological, social, and environmental factors, as maintained by D’Augelli (1994). In addition, various dimensions may combine to influence persons’ unique sexual identity development experience (Mohr & Fassinger, 2000; Mohr & Kendra, 2011).  Statement of Purpose This study serves to inform the counseling practices of mental health professionals across settings (clinical mental health, K-12 schools, and higher education), as well as other helping professions who provide services to same-gender loving West Indians who reside in the Caribbean region and its diaspora. Therefore, the goal of this study is to provide important contextual information regarding the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, of which there is a dearth in academic literature.   The American Counseling Association’s (ACA) Multicultural and Social Justice Counseling Competencies states that multicultural and social justice competent counselors “acknowledge that identity development influences the worldviews and lived experiences of privileged and marginalized clients” (Ratts, Singh, Nassar-McMillan, Butler, & McCullough, 2015, p. 6) and “acknowledge their strengths and limitations in working with clients from privileged and marginalized groups.” (Ratts et al., 2015, p.6).

Counselor educators may also utilize the findings of this study to demonstrate the critical role of social context and intersectionality of cultural identities, such as ethnicity, race, religion, socioeconomic status, and geographic location on the sexual orientation identity development process. This study serves to advocate for social justice and social  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        9    change for same-gender loving West Indians. It also serves to unsilence the voices of same-gender loving West Indians whose respective societies have marginalized their sexual identities and experiences. It is my hope that the experiences shared by participants, whether negative or positive, will illuminate the importance of a safe and identity-affirming society for all individuals.  Research Question  The research question that guided this study was: What experiences inform the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians?  Overview of Methodology I utilized a general qualitative research design and ethnographic interviewing to gain insight into the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians and the meaning-making of such experiences. This approach is considered most fitting because of its emphasis on culture and social context from participants’ or natives’ points of view (Spradley, 1979). The primary mode of data collection for this study was two in-depth semi-structured interviews of 11 participants from four Caribbean islands. Each interview lasted between 60 to 90 minutes and followed an interview guide (see Appendix A). Each interview was transcribed. A qualitative thematic analysis which employed aspects of ethnographic analysis was instituted.  To ensure this study’s trustworthiness, I continuously engaged in self-reflection to and interrogated my own sexual identity development experiences through journaling, which took place throughout the data collection and data analysis processes. Further, I consulted with critical friends, who were three persons who were in the process of obtaining a doctoral degree or have completed a doctoral degree. Lastly, I engaged in member-checking by consulting with four  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        10    participants, one person from each Caribbean island represented in this study, who provided feedback on my analysis of data and the overall findings of this study. Rationale and Significance This study examined the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians as they came to understand and accept their identities as same-gender loving; explored experiences with family, religious, academic, employment, and other social institutions during this process; and assessed experiences with intersecting identities and how they have informed the sexual identity development. The significance of this study is its ability to address these critical areas. By centering Caribbean culture and social contexts, this study offers new information for academic literature and the practice of counselors and other helping professionals in understanding the complex and nuanced ways in which Caribbean people experience sexual identity development. Sexual identity development theories assert that the sexual orientation identity development process involves the presence and resolution of internal conflicts related to one’s feelings and experiences as same-gender loving, and people’s interactions with their environment/society are influential (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005; Cass, 1984; McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). This holds significant implications for same-gender loving West Indians who live and have spent their formative years in a homonegative social system, and have existed at the intersection of colonialism, patriarchy, and homophobia.      Sexual identity development has been a topic of interest for scholars as early as the 1950s (Cass, 1979). Since then, research on sexual identity development has slowly expanded to include the intersection of race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic class, and spirituality (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005). International scholarship also has been dedicated to the sexual orientation identity development of Africans, Latin Americans, Middle Easterners, and South  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        11    and East Asians (Bilodeu & Renn, 2005). Despite the small body of empirical research on queer sexuality in the Caribbean (e.g., Ghisyawan, 2016; Wekker, 2006; West & Cowell, 2015), the studies are mostly from the sociology discipline and do not specifically address the psychological aspect of sexual orientation identity development. Moreover, as noted by Couzens and colleagues (2017), research on Caribbean populations mostly reflect the island of Jamaica.  By utilizing a qualitative research approach, this study provided an in-depth exploration of participants’ lived experiences that informed their sexual identity development. Ethnographic interviewing techniques facilitated an in-depth exploration of culture and social context during this process. The new knowledge obtained from this study will inform the practices of counselors, other helping professionals, and counselor educators who, to date, have relied upon theoretical frameworks and other forms of empirical research that do not reflect the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. It is also my hope that the findings of this study will inform policy makers to provide rights and protections for same-gender loving West Indians and serve as an impetus for future research on this population.   Role of the Researcher  My role in this study is that of primary researcher. With the guidance of my dissertation committee, I have conceptualized, planned, and implemented all aspects of this study. As the researcher, my role was also that of the main research instrument, who collected and analyzed data (Clark & Veale, 2018). Clark and Veale (2018) discussed the importance of a positionality statement, which allows readers to consider the research topic and its findings in the context of the researcher’s stance. It also provides researchers the opportunity to locate themselves overtly in relation to the topic, which the following paragraphs aim to do (Clark & Veale, 2018; Ross, 2017).   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        12     I am a same-gender loving Antiguan woman whose formative years were spent living on the beautiful Caribbean island of Antigua. The early stages of my sexual-orientation identity development involved a significant amount of intrapersonal conflict and confusion after learning from a very young age that homosexuality was wrong and would negatively impact my reputation and that of my family. My intrapersonal conflict was also exacerbated by the fact that I had no access to counseling services, as mental health counseling in Antigua during the 1990s was scarce, if at all available. My adverse experiences during my own sexual identity development largely contributed to my decision to be a professional counselor. It has also shaped my research interest in exploring the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians from a psychosocial perspective with hopes of contributing to the knowledge base of the counseling profession and other helping professions who serve same-gender loving West Indians in the Caribbean region and its diaspora.   The nature of qualitative research is such that subjectivity is inevitable and biases do have the potential to influence the outcomes of a study (Clark & Veale, 2018; Merriam, 2009). For this reason, I engaged in various strategies to increase the credibility of my findings, which include ongoing self-analysis through reflective journaling, and member checking, and the utilization of critical friends, all of which will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3.  Chapter Summary Although the study of sexual identity development has received academic attention as early as the 1970s (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005), scholarship on the experiences that inform the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians is significantly lacking. As a result, counselors and other helping professionals rely on sexual identity development frameworks and theories that do not reflect the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians.

Hereafter, I will provide an outline of how this dissertation is organized and a list of definition of key terms that pertain to this study. Organization of Dissertation In chapter two, I provide an in-depth review of literature that pertain to sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians, including psychosocial development theory and a chronological presentation of sexual identity development theories. Thereafter, I provide review of empirical research that address the psychosocial experiences of same-gender loving people in the Caribbean. In chapter 3 I provide an in-depth discussion of this study’s methodology, including my positionality to the topic, the use of a general qualitative research design in which I employ ethnographic interviewing. Further, I discuss participant recruitment, data collection, data analysis, and the trustworthiness of this study. In chapter four, I present the findings of this study and discuss the emergent themes that reflect the experiences that inform the sexual identity development of the 11 same-gender loving West Indians who participated in this study. In the final chapter, I will underscore the importance of the study’s findings in relation to the practice of counseling and allied helping professions, and the counselor education fields. I end this chapter and dissertation with the implications for future research.

Homonegativity is “the indifference, hostility, oppression and the overall lack of social, cultural, and institutional support that homosexuals experience as a consequence of their insertion into a predominantly heteronormative social ethos” (Cowell & Saunders, 2011, p. 317). Homophobia is negative perception toward sexual minorities as a result of “learned attitudes with distinct behavioral consequences that derive from a context marked by heternormativity” (Cowell & Saunders, 2011, p. 317). Queer: understood as an umbrella term; “refers to individuals who identify outside of the heteronormative imperative and/or the gender binary (e.g., those from the LGBTQQIA community, individuals who are opposed to marriage, individuals who practice polyamory).” (ALGBTIC LGBQQIA Competencies Taskforce, 2013, p. 42) Same-gender Loving is an Afrocentric and culturally affirming alternative to terms such as lesbian and gay and is primarily used within Black communities (Jourian, 2015). Sexual identity: Sexual identity, sometimes referred to as lesbian identity or gay identity, for example, is a sense of oneself as an individual of a certain sexual orientation (D'Augelli & Patterson, 1995).  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        15     Sexual Orientation is “the preponderance of erotic feelings, thoughts, fantasies one has for members of a particular sex, both sexes, or neither sex.” (Savin-Williams, 2005, p. 28).

Specifically, I begin by discussing Erikson’s (1962, 1968) theory of psychosocial development, which provides a frame of reference for participants’ psychological experiences as they navigated their respective Caribbean societies at various stages across the lifespan. Next, to illustrate the evolution of sexual identity development theory and scholarship, I provide a chronological presentation and discussion of various sexual identity development theories, from historical to modern renderings of the topic. To illuminate the importance of social and cultural context in the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians, I then provide a critical analysis of linear sexual identity development models in the context of the study.  The review of literature that follows begins with a brief historical overview of the Caribbean and its people. Next, I provide an in-depth discussion of empirical research on the psychosocial experiences of same-gender loving West Indians that are relevant to the sexual identity development process. The review of literature is categorized based on emergent themes in the literature. The final section discusses intersecting identities of same-gender loving West Indians and the imperative for such empirical research. The chapter closes with a brief overview of the chapter.  Theoretical Frameworks The following sections will present theoretical frameworks relevant to exploring the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians, beginning with Erik Erikson’s (1962) psychosocial development theory and Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory. These theoretical frameworks lay the groundwork for important contextual information regarding the population under study and also frames the findings of the study. Thereafter, I  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        17    chronologically present sexual identity development theories relevant to the research topic. To contextualize the presented sexual identity development theories in relation to same-gender loving West Indians, I then provide a critical analysis of linear models of sexual identity development, which are compared to a multidimensional perspective in conceptualizing the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians. Erikson Stages of Psychosocial Development  In exploring the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, Erik Erikson’s (1968) model of psychosocial development provided a theoretical perspective to understanding human psychosocial developmental tasks at various points across the lifespan. Such developmental tasks involve the interaction of persons’ social environment and maturing ego in the process of becoming a mature individual. It is important to note that Erikson’s theory, like most classic works on human development, focused almost exclusively on heterosexuals’ experiences, ignoring non-heterosexual pathways and processes of development (Patterson, 1995). Nevertheless, Erikson’s model provides a useful guide in framing and contextualizing the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians as they navigate psychosocial development simultaneously with sexual identity development across the lifespan.  Psychosocial development is broadly defined as the process by which persons integrate into their society while preserving a sense of individuality across the life span (Salkind, 2006). In this process, social and psychological forces intersect to influence the development of persons’ values, behaviors, and knowledge about themselves and the society in which they live (Salkind, 2006, 2008). Traditional models and theories of sexual identity development present the process as occurring against a backdrop of social stigma and oppression, which significantly influences persons’ self-image and personal adjustment (Troiden, 1988). Moreover, traditional  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        18    developmental perspectives of sexual identity, like psychosocial development, are viewed as occurring over a long period of time, with growth points conceptualized into ordered stages of development (Troiden, 1988).   Erik Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development addresses the ways in which personality develops and how persons form self-images (identity) while determining their role in society. This presents implications for same-gender loving persons whose self-image develops in an unfavorable social context. Described as a continuum of crises, Erikson’s theory presents eight stages of development that represent the psychological tasks persons face throughout their lives, from infancy to geriatrics (Salkind, 2008). Each psychosocial developmental stage presents implications for the development of a same-gender loving identity. However, as cautioned by Salkind (2008), age markers serve as heuristic devices and are not generalizable to all individuals or populations. Stage one, basic trust versus mistrust, attends to the quality of infants’ interactions with their caregivers. Feelings of love and security at this stage are determinants of infants’ development of trust and attachment that present implications later in life (Erikson, 1968; Salkind, 2008). Stage two, autonomy versus shame and doubt, is focused on children’s acquisition of a sense of independence and self-directed behaviors. Self-control is the defining characteristic of the third stage, initiative versus guilt. While developing new skills and abilities, toddlers are required to learn and implement self-control and balance their newly acquired autonomy and initiative to explore new found aspects of their world (Erikson, 1968; Salkind, 2008). Termed industry versus inferiority, the fourth stage is marked by the point in life when children are receiving systematic instruction through school and centers the effective completion of projects and children’s ability to master age-appropriate skills (Erikson, 1968; Salkind, 2008).  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        19    During the stage of industry versus inferiority, prior to puberty, same-gender loving persons typically experienced feelings of marginality and difference from their same-sex peers, though not specifically related to sexual orientation (Troiden, 1988). Feelings of difference often manifest in gender and sex roles, and gender expression (Troiden, 1988). In the fifth stage, identity versus role confusion, adolescents are faced with the task of determining their role in life and self-identity. Erikson (1968) described the adolescent task of identity definition as a critical and complex stage. It is often characterized by turmoil and confusion (Erikson, 1968; Salkind 2008). For same-gender loving persons, adolescence is typically a significant period of development when they realize that specific feelings and behaviors could be considered as homosexual, which often creates some dissonance with their previously held self-image (Troiden, 1988). This often creates some degree of identity confusion, characterized by questioning one’s sexuality and general identity (Cass, 1979; Troiden, 1988). Compounded by the social rejection of homosexuality, many same-gender loving persons also experience feelings of guilt and a need for social isolation.  By late middle to late adolescence, same-gender loving persons often view themselves as potentially same-gender loving and may respond to their identity confusion with denial, feelings of having to repair one’s self, avoidance, redefining one’s sexual attraction and behaviors in a more acceptable context, or by choosing to accept one’s identity as same-gender loving (Troiden, 1988).  Erikson considered healthy individuals to be those who share themselves in commitment with another person.  This task marks the sixth stage, intimacy versus isolation, in which long-term, intimate and committed relationships are considered to be valuable assets to feelings of wholeness and fulfillment (Erikson, 1968; Salkind, 2008). Erikson (1962) maintained that if persons do not develop a positive sense of self during adolescence, adults may become  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        20    emotionally isolated and lonely, and lack the capacity to form meaningful, intimate, and romantic relationships (Erikson, 1968; Salkins, 2008).   In the context of sexual identity development, commitment to one’s same-gender loving identity as a way of life can happen at any time across the lifespan (Troiden, 1988), but may have implications for the intimacy versus isolation stage of psychosocial development. Commitment, according to Troiden (1988), has both internal and external dimensions. It involves the internal redefinition of persons of the same-sex as meaningful and legitimate sources of romance and love, and feelings of satisfaction with one’s sexual identity. External indicators involve seeking emotionally meaningful and committed relationships with persons of the same-gender and being fulfilled by such relationships (Troiden, 1988). In the seventh stage, generativity versus stagnation, marriage (or commitment), and parenthood are considered to be tasks of middle-aged adults, aimed at fostering a sense of meaningfulness by contributing to upcoming generations, which may be done in the form of parenting, mentoring, and caring for others. The final stage, ego integrity versus despair, occurs later in life when persons asses the quality of life they lived as they prepare for death. The feeling of having a life well-lived is associated with ego integrity.  As the topic of sexual identity is explored, important ego qualities such as trust, autonomy, initiative, identity, and intimacy are likely to become salient. To create a more comprehensive understanding of sexual identity development, it is important to also consider the ways in which sexual identity development influences and is influenced by other developmental processes (Patterson, 1995). It is important to note that there are debates within the academic realm surrounding Erikson’s theoretical attention to culture, race, and ethnicity. For instance, feminist perspectives  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        21    and scholars have critiqued Erikson’s theory for emphasizing biological distinctiveness between men and women to explain psychosocial development, and the androcentric biases that are incorporated into the core concepts of this theory (Sorrel & Montgomery, 2009). As cited in Syed and Fish (2018), scholars such as Phinney (1990) contended that Erikson only alluded to cultural issues in his theorizing.  Syed and Fish (2018) argued that much of Erikson’s scholarship addresses the ways in which culture, race, and ethnicity shape identity and the influence of historical trauma on the identity development of marginalized groups.  As valuable as this may be, Erikson’s (1968) psychosocial theory specifically does not explicitly explain such critical issues, although his later scholarship does. These shortcomings must be considered within the context of this study, which explores the experiences of persons from counties with a strong colonial and enslavement history, who are marginalized within their societies due to their same gender loving identities. Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) Ecological Systems Theory Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theoretic model explains how children interact with their environments, also referred to as their ecological systems, to influence their growth and development in their respective societies.  This theory may be used to conceptualize how various ecological systems in people’s lives work together externally to influence their individual experiences. Categorized from the most intimate to the broadest, Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) model illustrates the social context of development into five interconnected layers or systems. The smallest and closest to individuals is the microsystem, which is comprised of family members and caregivers, schools, peers, religious institutions, and healthcare providers.  Examples of interactions within the microsystem involves children’s personal  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        22    interactions with parents/family members, classmates, members of religious institutions and leaders, and doctors. According to Bronfenbrenner (1979), children’s interactions with people within their microsystem influence the way that they view and treat others and themselves. The mesosystem involves the interactions and links between various systems in children’s lives. For example, parental interactions with children’s schools, involvement in children’s peer relationships, and familial relationships with religious communities.    According to Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) theory, the exosystem reflects connections or linkages between settings that affect children’s lives, but do not directly involve them. Examples of exosystem would be community-based family resources, such as counseling services, that a child may or may not be able to access, or their parents’ work schedules. In both examples, children are not directly involved with either setting, however, their lives are impacted by how each setting operates. The macrosystem, according to Bronfenbrenner (1979), is the largest and outermost layer and is comprised of cultural values, beliefs, customs, and laws which inevitably impact children’s lives. The principles reflected within the macrosystem are reflected within and influence the interactions between all other layers. For example, heteronormative societal and cultural values are likely to be reflected in the values that parents convey to children within the microsystem. The chronosystem in Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory incorporates the dimension of time and represents how change influences children’s environment.  In the context of the current study, Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory provides a useful framework for conceptualizing how same-gender loving West Indian participants’ interactions with various ecological systems influence their sexual identity development experiences within their respective Caribbean societies. Specifically, this  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        23    framework is useful in assessing how same-gender loving West Indians’ socio-historical Caribbean backgrounds have been influenced by colonialism, reflected in the chronosystem, which influences Caribbean societies’ attitudes and laws regarding homosexuality in the macrosystem. Moreover, this framework is useful with identifying how various institutional policies regarding homosexuality and homosexual identities within the exosystem impact same-gender loving West Indians, and how social institutions in their microsystem interact within the mesosystem to influence their sexual identity development. Historical Overview of Relevant Developmental Models Cass (1979, 1984) Sexual Orientation Identity Development Model Cass (1979) developed a homosexual identity formation model, which was empirically tested for validity in a later study. Cass’ (1979, 1984) theoretical model outlined the process by which individuals recognize and eventually acquire identities as “homosexuals” or same-gender loving into their self-concept. This model is grounded within the framework of interpersonal congruency theory, which holds that the degree to which persons are congruent with their environment is a significant determinant of the changes and stability in their behavior (Cass, 1979, 1984). This model is based on two broad assumptions: (a) that the acquisition of identity happens through a developmental process; and (b) that changes in behavior are influenced by persons’ experiences with their environment (Cass, 1979). Identity formation in the context of sexual orientation, according to Cass (1984), is conceptualized as a developmental process characterized by a series of six ordered stages or points of growth that correspond with certain experiences. Moreover, progression through these ordered stages is characterized by (a) accepting the label of gay or lesbian into one’s self-concept; (b) a positive attitude toward one’s self-identity as lesbian or gay; (c) a desire to self- TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        24    disclose one’s identity; and (d) increased and eventually frequent social connection with gay men and lesbians (Cass, 1984). Cass (1984) described this developmental process as a series of cognitive, behavioral, and affective changes, and it is on these dimensions that the stages are distinguished. The stages of Cass’ identity formation are described below. Prestage 1. Cass (1984) considered this stage to be characterized by individuals ’consideration of heterosexuality as normative, their view of homosexuality as a minority status, and the assumption of a heterosexual identity (Kenneady & Oswalt, 2014). Stage 1: Identity confusion. Individuals recognize that their actions, thoughts, and feelings are different from what is considered the heterosexual norm and may be defined as homosexual. This may cause significant confusion, as their previously held self-concept is now questioned (Cass, 1984). How individuals progress from this stage is determined by whether this homosexual definition is perceived as accurate or inaccurate, and desirable or not (Cass, 1979, 1984). Stage 2: Identity comparison. At this stage, individuals accept their identity as homosexual as potentially accurate. Individuals at this stage feel alienated from their heterosexual counterparts, whereas the distinction between their heterosexual counterparts becomes salient (Cass, 1979, 1984). At this stage, identity foreclosure, characterized by a complete denial of homosexual thoughts and feelings, is possible (Cass, 1984). When identity foreclosure does not occur, the individual may consider social engagement with other sexual minorities in an attempt to reduce feelings of alienation (Cass, 1984). Stage 3: Identity tolerance. This stage is characterized by same-gender loving persons intentionally seeking the company of other same-gender loving persons as a means of emotional and social connection, resulting from an increased commitment to one’s self-image as a sexual  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        25    minority (Cass, 1979, 1984). Individuals are still selective about such contacts, and connections are typically done on the basis of necessity (Cass, 1979, 1984). It is also typical for individuals in this stage to maintain a public (heterosexual) image and a private one that is reserved for the company of other sexual minorities (Cass, 1984). Stage 4: Identity acceptance. By the Identity Acceptance Stage, sexual minorities have become more connected with others within this population, which works to encourage a positive view of homosexuality as a sexual minority identity becomes clearer (Cass, 1979, 1984). Individuals continue their work to fit into society, while maintaining a positive self-image. In such cases, it is not uncommon for persons to publicly portray heterosexuality in an attempt to avoid negative rejection from others (Cass, 1984). This stage was considered by Cass (1984) to be a peaceful stage, as the difficult questions of who one is, and one’s place of belonging has been resolved.  Stage 5: Identity pride. Feelings of pride and loyalty to one’s identity and other sexual minorities characterize this stage. Individuals become angry about society’s stigmatization of homosexuality and the oppression that sexual minorities face (Cass, 1984). This may cause persons to devalue heterosexuals as there they challenge heteronormativity to promote validity and equality of sexual minorities (Cass, 1984). Stage 6: Identity synthesis. In this stage, the rejection of social stigmatization and pride of one’s identity as a sexual minority is maintained from the previous stage. In this stage, however, it is less emotionally charged (Cass, 1984). Individuals at this stage no longer consider their homosexual identity as their primary identity, but is now considered only one component of themselves. At this stage, individuals’ views of themselves and their perception of how they are viewed by others are synthesized, such that their public and private selves are congruent and self- TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        26    disclosure is no longer a struggle (Cass, 1984). It is at this stage, according to Cass (1984), that identity formation is complete.  McCarn and Fassinger (1996) Sexual Orientation Development Model McCarn and Fassinger’s (1996) model of sexual identity development attempted to build on the strengths of previous models, such as Cass (1979, 1984), while addressing previous deficits, which included highlighting the flexibility of status (as opposed to linear stages) and was built on a previous model of lesbian identity formation (Fassinger, 1991; McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). In their construction of this model, the authors intended to be inclusive of the diversity of ways in which individuals come to consider and accept themselves as sexual minorities. In so doing, McCarn and Fassinger (1996) distinguished parallel processes (also called branches) of personal development: individual sexual identity and group membership identity, which are considered to be reciprocally catalytic but not necessarily simultaneous.  The individual identity development branch focuses on internal processes of understanding and accepting same-sex attraction and sexual desires. The group member identity branch focuses on addressing social attitudes toward such desires and how one self-defines as a result of such attitudes (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). There are four stages of each of these processes (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). The authors used the term phases (as opposed to stages) in this model to imply greater flexibility and fluidity. McCarn and Fassinger (1996) also described development to be circular and continuous. Self-disclosure, according to this theory, is not considered evidence of developmental advancement; instead it is the acknowledgement and resolution of internal conflict at each phase (Fassinger, 1991; McCarn & Fassinger, 1996) that does.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        27    Phase 1: Awareness. This initial phase, according to the authors, involves feelings of difference and feelings that one’s desires are different from what is considered to be the norm. Previously held assumptions that heterosexuality is universal are questioned, but not in relation to one’s self (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). Group member identity characteristics at this phase involve the realization that a community of sexual minorities exists (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). Phase 2 : Exploration. During this phase, there is a deeper exploration of questions the first phase, including sexual feelings. Persons in this phase, however, may not explore sexual behaviors or engage with a variety of sexual partners (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). McCarn and Fassinger hypothesized that for women, this often included the development of deep relationships and feelings for other women, which may or may not be sexual in nature (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). In the context of group membership, McCarn and Fassinger (1996) held that persons aim to find their place in reference to the sexual minority community by seeking knowledge about same-gender loving people and engaging in the complex process of examining one’s own attitudes towards the sexual minority community and the possibility of belonging to this group.  Phase 3: Deepening/Commitment. Exploration in the previous stage creates greater self-awareness, self-knowledge, and clear choices about sexuality. In this stage, self-fulfillment takes priority, which transcends previously held beliefs about one’s identity (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). Group member identity characteristics involve a deepened understanding and awareness of oppression faced by the sexual minority group, and an appreciation for being a part of the sexual minority group (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996).  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        28    Phase 4: Internalization/Synthesis. This phase is characterized by even greater clarity and self-acceptance that may have resulted from many years of emotional and sexual-exploration (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). McCarn and Fassinger (1996) noted that at this phase, persons make conscious decisions about when and how they wish to be open about their sexuality. It is critical to note that McCarn and Fassinger (1996) maintained that it is the process of resolving the decision of whether to self-disclose, not the content of the resolution, which creates integration. For instance, it may be a woman’s decision not to self-disclose in a particular situation; however, she is equally as integrated as a woman who has self-disclosed because the choice was addressed (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). Group member identity development is characterized by feelings of fulfillment and security in one’s sexual orientation as well as the ability to maintain a sexual minority self-concept across social contexts (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). D’Augelli (1994) Life-Span Approach to Sexual Orientation Identity Development  D’Augelli (1994) provided an alternative to stage models, as scholars increasingly described same-gender loving identity development as fluid, complex, and impacted by other social identities that persons may hold (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005). D’Augelli (1994) offered a life- span human developmental perspective that attends to social contexts in ways that previous stage models did not. D’Augelli (1994) stressed the imperative for a sexual orientation identity development model to account for persons’ changes throughout the lifespan to death, patterns of social intimacy, and the links between the same-gender loving person, their significant others, and their close and distant environments. D’Augelli (1994) further argued that, to varying degrees, sexual and affectional feelings can change over the course of a person’s life such that emotional and physical connections for someone of the same sex can occur later in life. For  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        29    instance, should an older person become attracted to someone of the same sex later in life, it does not imply repression of same-sex attractions at earlier stages in life. Instead, sexual orientation ought to be viewed as a lifelong process, which dispels the view that sexual orientation is fixed early in life (D’Augelli, 1994).  D’Augelli (1994) presented a six identity life-span approach to sexual identity development that operates independently and does not occur in a specific order. The identity processes of D’Augelli’s (1994) model were: (1) Exiting heterosexuality; (2) Developing a personal LGB identity; (3) Developing an LGB social identity; (4) Becoming an LGB offspring; (5) Developing an LGB intimacy status; and (6) Entering an LGB community (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005). Exiting heterosexual identity. At this state, same-gender loving persons ’concerns involve a recognition that their sexual orientation is not heterosexual. They seek to understand the nature of their attractions and to label them (D’Augelli, 1994). Exiting heterosexuality, according to D’Augelli (1994), also involves disclosing their same-gender loving identity, which occurs throughout their lives.  Developing a personal lesbian-gay-bisexual identity status. For same-gender loving persons, this state involves stabilizing their thoughts, feelings and desires surrounding their identity, and are propelled toward social interaction (D’Augelli, 1994). A critical component of personal identity status is recognizing internalized myths about nonheterosexuality, including negative stereotypes, which are challenged by engaging with persons whose lives counter such negative and incorrect stereotypes (D’Augelli, 1994).   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        30    Developing a lesbian-gay-bisexual social identity. This state involves the lifelong process of creating a large network of persons who are aware of and affirm their same-gender loving identity and provide social support (D’Augelli, 1994).   Becoming a lesbian-gay-bisexual offspring. At this state, D’Augelli (1994) described the common temporary disruption in parental relationships and reintegration that follows the disclosure of same-gender loving person’s sexual orientation. D’Augelli (1994) posited that at this state immediate and extended family members show complex patterns of adaptation, which involves maintaining privacy regarding the same-gender loving person’s identity. This works to reinforce the stigma of a same-gender loving identity and keeps the same-gender loving person at a distance.  Developing a lesbian-gay-bisexual intimacy status. This state, according to D’Augelli (1994), involved navigating intimate same-gender loving relationships in the context of living in a heteronormative society.  In the absence of cultural norms surrounding intimate same-gender loving relationships, which often leads to ambiguity and uncertainty, same-gender loving persons devise their own personal, community, and couple-specific norms.  Entering a lesbian-gay-bisexual community. D’Augelli (1994) described this set of identity processes as involving social and political action and being open as same-gender loving persons in various aspects of their lives. In a more recent critique of historical perspectives of sexual orientation identity development, D’Augelli (2012) postulated a multidimensional, multigenerational developmental view in which he underscored the imperative to include considerations of cohort in understanding sexual orientation. Departing from previous theories that centered only sexual attraction at the expense of important contextual factors such as human development and associated needs, family, society, culture, and history, D’Augelli (2012) argued  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        31    that early scholarship decontextualized sexual orientation. Moreover, the cohort in which a person experiences sexual identity processes, in tandem with other contextual influencers, ought not to be ignored. For instance, a high school student in today’s society who identifies as any aspect of same-gender loving could most likely access social support (such as a school gay-straight alliance) and experience LGBTQ visibility in the media, unlike a person of an older generation during their teenage years. To portray sexual identity development without a multigenerational, multidimensional view is to give a gravely incomplete and inaccurate portrait of a highly complex and nuanced process (D’Augelli, 2012). Weinberg, Williams, and Prior (1994) Bisexual Identity Development   Weinberg, Williams, and Prior (1994) added to the body of literature on sexual orientation identity development through the development of a bisexual identity development model. Existent homosexual identity development models, despite variance in the number of stages presented in each model, all shared three similar elements: (1) the person experiencing some state of identity confusion and feelings of difference from peers; (2) a period of tentatively considering oneself to be homosexual and attempts to associate with other homosexuals, homosexual subculture, and sexual experimentation; and (3) an acceptance of a homosexual label and an attempt to integrate a homosexual identity into one’s self-concept. This involves self-disclosure as homosexual and acculturating into the homosexual community and way of life (Weinberg et al., 1994). Weinberg and colleagues (1994) essentially sought to explore how persons develop an identity as bisexual, dealing with opposition from both the heterosexual and homosexual communities, and the extent to which there is overlap with homosexual orientation identity development. Weinberg and colleagues (1994) devised four stages of bisexual orientation identity development.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        32     First, the Initial Confusion stage is characterized by feelings of considerable doubt and confusion regarding their strong sexual feelings for both women and men. Weinberg et al. (1994) described these feelings as disorienting, unsettling, and even frightening. As a result, persons in this stage are reluctant to label themselves as bisexual initially (Weinberg et al., 1994). After time, in some cases several years, persons begin to define themselves as bisexual. This often happens as a result of being exposed to the word bisexual and an exploration of this identity. A turning point at this stage could be a first homosexual or heterosexual sexual experience and recognizing that sex with both sexes is pleasurable (Weinberg et al., 1994).   The following stage, Settling into the Identity, is a period in which persons completed the transition in self-labeling as bisexual and began settling into their bisexual identity. This process involves increased self-acceptance with less attention to the negative opinions of others regarding their sexual preferences (Weinberg et al., 1994)   Weinberg and colleagues (1994) labeled the final stage, Continued Uncertainty, as confusion is considered to be a “built in feature of being bisexual” (Weinberg et al., 1994, p. 34). This comes as a result of living in a society in which being monosexual is expected. Thus, closure on what it means to be bisexual could be an ongoing challenge (Weinberg et al., 1994).  Mohr and Kendra (2011) Revision and Extension of a Multidimensional Measure of Sexual Minority Identity The work of Mohr and Kendra (2011) reflected a shift that had taken place in the sexual orientation identity development literature, which fully embraced a multidimensional approach to sexual orientation identity development. This was also reflected in the prior scholarship of D’Augelli and Patterson (1995) and Mohr and Fassinger (2000). The literature also progressed from using the terms sexual orientation and sexual identity interchangeably to differentiating  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        33    between them.  This allowed for a more accurate, comprehensive, and precise understanding of both constructs. Sexual orientation denotes a person’s sexual and emotional affinity and desire directed toward people of the same sex, opposite sex, both sexes, neither, etc. (Lev, 2004). As noted by Lev (2004), sexual orientation may reflect a person’s love-object choice, not whether they act on those feelings. Sexual identity, on the other hand, is a broad paradigm that refers to a person’s sense of their own sexuality, which includes an integration of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender role, and biological sex (Lev, 2004). Thus, it is possible for persons to engage in same-sex sexual behavior and not have a same-gender loving sexual identity. Inversely, a person’s sexual orientation could be any aspect of same-gender loving (e.g., bisexual) and yet not engage in same-sex sexual behavior.  In response to the literature’s attention to the various dimensions of same-gender loving identities, Mohr and Kendra’s (2011) scholarship focused on psychometric data on a multidimensional measure of lesbian, gay, and bisexual identities and addressed measurement-related concerns of existent measures. Mohr and Kendra’s (2011) work was an extension and revision of Mohr and Fassinger’s (2000) Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale.  Mohr and Kendra’s (2011) identified six dimensions of sexual identity development: (1) Internalized homonegativity, which is a rejection of one’s same-gender loving identity; (2) Concealment motivation, which reflects a person’s inclination and reasons for protecting one’s privacy about his or her same-gender loving identity; (3) Acceptance concerns, which reflect concerns about being stigmatized for one’s same-gender loving identity; (4) Identity uncertainty, when one questions one’s sexual identity; (5) Identity superiority, which is viewing same-gender loving persons more favorably than heterosexual people; and (6) Finding the experience of developing a same-gender loving identity a difficult one. In relation to the current study, Mohr  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        34    and Kendra’s (2011) multidimensional approach to sexual identity facilitates an in-depth and comprehensive exploration of same-gender loving West Indian’s sexual identity development experiences. In contrast to linear stage models, a multidimensional approach allows for fluidity of experiences and the examination of cultural factors that influence sexual identity. Critique of Linear Stage Models of Sexual Orientation Identity Development  Developmental perspectives of sexual identity development (e.g., Cass, 1979, 1984; Coleman, 1982; McCarn & Fassinger, 1996; Troiden, 1988) have laid the groundwork for decades in providing helpful frameworks for counselors, educators, and other helping professionals to refer to when seeking to understand the experiences and behaviors of same-gender loving persons as they develop same-gender loving identities (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005). Although developmental models of sexual identity have evolved over time, there are several similarities among them. Essentially, these models hold that in a linear process, persons move from a presumed heterosexual identity, to questioning and/or denial of same-sex attraction, to acceptance of their identity, to finally integrating their same-gender loving identity into other aspects of their identity and personhood after overcoming a series of internal conflicts throughout the process (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005).  Critics of linear sexual identity development models (e.g., Brown, 1995; Edwards, 1997; Gervacio, 2015; Malcolm, 2008) have cautioned that given the complex and nuanced ways in which sexual identity development takes place, they ought not to serve as a catchall for every individual’s experience. As North American countries become more diverse with immigrants from the Caribbean region, and as the counseling profession advances within the Caribbean region, it is imperative that helping professionals be mindful of both the strengths and limitations of linear developmental perspectives of sexual orientation identity  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        35    development frameworks and other developmental processes that may occur concurrently with sexual orientation identity (Gervacio, 2015). In the following paragraphs, I will provide a critical analysis of linear sexual identity development models, particularly within the context of this study.  The critiques of linear models of sexual identity development will focus on four key areas: (a) oversimplification of the sexual identity development process; (b) a lack of addressing the life long process of sexual identity development; (c) the narrow focus on gay and lesbian identity development; and (e) ignoring aspects of race and ethnicity in the sexual identity development process.  Oversimplification of the sexual identity development process. Linear models of sexual identity development, particularly Cass’ (1979, 1984) model, are considered to be the most well-known and well-referenced sexual identity development frameworks (Kenneady & Oswalt, 2014). One major strength of Cass’ (1979, 1984) and other linear models are the clear, simple descriptors of each developmental stage of sexual orientation (Kenneady & Oswalt, 2014). One major critique of linear models, however, is ironically in the oversimplification of the sexual orientation process (Gervacio, 2015; Kenneady & Oswalt, 2014). Generally, developmental models are linear in nature and do no account for or address experiences outside of the prescribed hierarchy of stages and their related characteristics. Thus, critical influential factors, such as social context, and cultural factors such as race, religion, customs, history, and naming practices are virtually ignored. For same-gender loving West Indians, this is particularly relevant. Given the racial, religious, and cultural diversity of each Caribbean island and its people, a solely linear perspective of sexual orientation overlooks the nuanced and complex ways in which same-gender loving West Indians develop their sexual identity in tandem with other existing identities.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        36     Linear models are constricted to suggesting only a single path of sexual identity development, ignoring the possibility of multiple paths to multiple identities (Kenneady & Oswalt, 2014). A rigid assumption that same-gender loving West Indians experienced a hierarchy of ordered stages ignores the impact of living in a homonegative Caribbean society and, in some cases, sans laws that protect the physical, psychological, and human rights. This inadvertently pathologizes or misrepresents behaviors such as non-disclosure and unwillingness to socially and/or romantically engage with other same-gender loving persons in that society. Linear models also do not account for any variance between gay men and lesbians in the order, timing, and completion of each stage (Horowitz & Newcomb, 2002; Sophie, 1986). This perspective suggests that social and environmental influences could cause persons to experience more than one stage at a time or regress to earlier stages, which are not reflected in linear modes (Kenneady & Oswalt, 2014).  A lack of addressing the lifelong process of sexual identity development. The progressive nature of linear sexual identity development models fails to account for fluidity in sexual identity, which can change across the life span. As noted by Kenneady and Oswalt, (2014), as experiences occur and as awareness heightens, identities can change. Linear models, such as Cass (1979, 1984) and McCarn and Fassinger (1996) suggested some stability in sexual orientation over time. However, a growing body of research suggests that sexuality is fluid and is likely to change over the lifespan (Diamond, 2008).     D’Augelli (1994) life span model provided an alternate perspective and approach to understanding sexual identity and its related experiences. This perspective illuminated the multidimentional nature of sexual orientation and, unlike linear models of sexual identity development, centralized social context in examining sexual identity development (Bilodeau  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        37    & Renn, 2005). D’Augelli’s (1994) life span model portrayed sexual identity development as concurrently unfolding with other developing areas, including self-concept, familial relationships, and peer and community connections, which linear models do not (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005). Such a perspective is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of how diverse same-gender loving West Indians develop their sexual identity, particularly persons whose developmental trajectory do not reflect those delineated by developmental models. An example of this might be a woman who previously identified as heterosexual, was married to a man, and later in life identifies as a lesbian and entered a same-gender loving relationship.   The narrow focus on gay men and lesbians. Another significant criticism of linear models of sexual identity development is that they primarily focus on the experiences of lesbians and gay men, do not fully account for the experiences of bisexual persons, and are often limited to the experiences of cisgender persons (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005; Kenneady & Oswalt, 2014). Research by Rust (1993) and Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter and Levy-Warren (2009) showed differences in the sexual identity development experiences between lesbians and bisexual women. Similarly, Weinberg and colleagues (1994) found differences between gay and bisexual men’s sexual identity experiences, which linear models do not address. In this vein, sexual identity scholars, such as McCarn and Fassinger (1996), Diamond (2003), and Schneider (2001) argued that there is variance in the sexual identity development between men and women. As noted by Kenneady & Oswalt, (2014), the literature reflected that women often become self-ware and self-identify at a later age than men and are more likely to identify as bisexual. Many women, unlike men, embraced a same-gender loving identity before engaging in a same-sex sexual experience. Although this  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        38    study does not explore the variance in sexual identity development experiences between men and women specifically, it is open to participants of all genders and captured the ways in which gender, as an intersecting identity, influenced their sexual identity development.  Ignoring aspects of race and ethnicity in the sexual identity development Process. Cass’ (1979, 1984) and other sexual identity development research has been largely based on the experiences of White, middle-class, gay men (Cass, 1979, 1984; Gervacio, 2015; Kenneady & Oswalt, 2014) and therefore does not account for the experiences of racial and ethnic minorities or how factors such as racism (and other cultural issues) influence the sexual orientation identity development (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005; Kenneady & Oswalt, 2014; Rosario et al., 2004). For example, Rosario and colleagues (2004) found in a comparison study of Black, Latino, and White youths that Black youths reported less engagement with LGBTQ social events, were less comfortable with self-disclosure about their sexual identity, and self-disclosed to fewer people than White participants. As noted by Kenneady and Oswalt (2014), people with multiple minority identities, such as being a woman, lesbian, and Black, often experienced more difficulties during their identity development, as their minority identities often conflict but not are addressed in linear models. For same-gender loving West Indians, this limitation of linear models is particularly relevant, as the nuances associated with race and colorism in the postcolonial Caribbean (Couzens et al., 2017) are important but easily overlooked factors in the lives of same-gender loving West Indians. Despite the void in empirical research on the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, existent research reflects homonegativity in the Caribbean (Cowell & Saunders, 2011; Rambarran & Simpson, 2016; West & Cowell,  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        39    2015). That homonegativity presents implications regarding factors such as social engagement with other same-gender loving persons, self-disclosure, naming practices, and identity which may not reflect the prescribed trajectory delineated by linear models of sexual identity. For instance, Carpenter (2017) conducted a qualitative study on the identities and sexual practices of 28 women who have sex with women (WSW) in Jamaica and found that all WSWs did not self-identify as lesbian. Participants reported that culturally, their identities were largely determined by their mode of dress, the sexual phenotype to which they are attracted, and their roles during sexual intercourse. These mores were such that WSWs who embraced the identity of lesbian were those who dressed in masculine or androgynous clothing and never engaged in sexual intercourse with men. There are also indigenous terms for same-sex love and desire in the Caribbean, such as the Carriacouan term zami (Lorde, 1982), the Surinamese term matti (Wekker, 2006), and Cuban term oremi (Allen, 2012), which do not denote an identity per se, but the act of engaging in sexual relations and creating family ties with men and women, either simultaneously or consecutively, as a social means for sharing resources (Ghisyawan, 2016). Thus, the process by which a person ascribes a label to their same-gender loving identity is multifaceted, influenced by other intersecting identities, such as ethnicity, and various psychosocial factors, which historical linear models cannot capture (Pinto, 2018).  Professionals who rely solely on linear models of sexual identity development when working with same-gender loving West Indians fall short of understanding and embracing the critical roles of social and cultural context, intersecting identities, and the nuanced and complex ways in which acquire a same-gender loving identity. This study therefore incorporates a multidimensional lens, which accepts sexual identity as multifaceted, fluid,  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        40    nonlinear, and a lifelong process, which allows for a thorough and comprehensive understanding of sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians.  Modern Perspectives Applied to Sexual Identity Academic understandings of sexual identity have evolved over time. While traditional perspectives on the topic have exclusively centered the intrapersonal experiences associated with same-sex attractions (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005), modern theoretical perspectives, such as Queer Theory and Intersectionality Theory, have provided important contextual considerations for a comprehensive and thorough understandings of same-gender loving sexual identities. The following paragraphs will discuss modern perspectives related to sexual identity, specifically Queer Theory and Intersectionality Theory, which help to frame this study’s exploration of the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, particularly the data collection, data analyses, and discussion of the findings. Queer Theory  In recent years, the term ‘queer ’has been used to denote a coalition of culturally marginalized groups of persons whose self-identifications defy what society has prescribed as normal (Jagose, 1996). Historically, however, the term queer has held a variety of meanings, from slang for same-gender loving persons to a derogatory term for members of that population (Jagose, 1996). Queer could reflect an identity (or set of identities) in relation to gender and sexuality or a nascent theoretical perspective that has its roots in lesbian and gay studies (Halperin, 1995; Jagose, 1996). Despite its various uses, the term queer remains in a process of formation, intermediate, and elastic in its definition. These attributes are the constituent characteristics of queer (Jagose, 1996).   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        41    Queer theory, introduced by Teresa de Lauretis in 1990 at a lesbian and gay sexuality conference, challenged the idea of fixed identities and worked to invalidate heteronormativity, which is the perspective that the only normal sexual orientation is pure heterosexuality. Thus, men and women have inimitable roles to play in relation to each other (Tindall & Waters, 2012). Queer theory illuminates the fluidity and diversity of gender and sexuality within a social context and, through the restructuring of discourses on gender and sexuality, works to alter oppressive power structures.  The roots of queer theory are in the gay rights movement, a period in history when the LGBTQ community resisted heteronormativity in all forms, detached from societal stereotypes, and defined themselves for themselves (Tindall & Waters, 2012). As noted by Butler (1990), queer theory argued that sexuality could not accurately be categorized into simplified groups, such as lesbian, bisexual, or gay. Thus, persons need not strive to fit into a socially prescribed set of categories but instead embrace a queer identity. Moreover, Butler (1990) argued that the construct of identity is fictitious; it presumes predictable and consistent behaviors across the lifespan, which is inaccurate. Socially prescribed categories inevitably work to strategically control, oppress, and assign privilege.  Queer theorists have addressed the concept of identity from various perspectives. This includes understanding how commonly utilized sexual orientation categories and labels influence life and the ways in which persons view and understand themselves and others. Queer theorists have also examined the elimination of socially prescribed identity categories for a more liberated existence (Jagose, 1996; Warner, 2004). Sedgwick (2003) maintained that individuals create and maintain their identity by using performances, which reflect who they truly are or who society has depicted them to be.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        42    In the context of the current study on the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians, queer theory by its tenets problematizes colonial prescriptions of sexuality. This theory facilitates a decolonization of sexual identity, including prescribed same-gender loving categories such as lesbian, gay, or bisexual labels in favor of a more open and fluid perspective of sexuality.  Intersectionality The concept of intersectionality has its roots in Black feminism (Crenshaw, 1989, 1991). As a theoretical framework, intersectionality centers the social location and experiences of groups of persons who have historically been sexually, economically, educationally, culturally, and politically marginalized within society (Sears, 2012). This theory is based on the premise that persons within marginalized groups also hold multiple identities and social statuses in relation to race, gender, social class, age, disability, citizen status, nationality, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation (Sears, 2012). Unlike common feminist perspectives that focus on a single or salient source of oppression, such as gender or race, an intersectional perspective facilitates the analysis of the ways in which persons ’multiple identities and social locations intersect, how privilege and oppression are experienced simultaneously, and how oppression is maintained on these bases (Sears, 2012).  Black feminists worked to challenge the focus of feminism that centered exclusively on the concerns of White, middle- to upper-class women to the detriment of women of color and women of other social classes (Cheshire, 2013). This attention to Black women’s experiences and the intersectionality of their oppressions posed a significant challenge to the core of feminism. It required White privileged feminists to recognize the racist, classist, and heterosexist nature of their feminism (Cheshire, 2013). In recent times, there has been an increase in the use  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        43    and application of intersectionality theory across academic disciplines (Cheshire, 2013; Shields, 2008). In the field of education, for instance, intersectionality theory is utilized for pedagogical purposes to challenge colonial assumptions and illuminate how oppressive power manifests within the classroom context (Cheshire, 2013). Although the field of psychology has historically taken a singular approach to identities, the discipline has begun to incorporate intersectionality theory into research, perspectives on gender, and counseling theories and practices (Cheshire, 2013). Hill-Collins (1986), in her discourse on Black feminist thought, posits that there are commonalities in the perception of experiences among Black women that they share as members of two marginalized groups. Yet, despite commonalities in outlook, the diversity of intersecting identities of sexual orientation, race, class, age and religion will result in diverse experiences and expressions of the commonalities, which Black feminist thought aims to make evident through observations and interpretations about Black womanhood (Hill-Collins, 1986).   Cultural competence within helping professions, such as the counseling field, is an imperative. The ethical code of the American Counseling Association underscore the importance of respecting and understanding persons’ cultural identities in counseling practices (American Counseling Association, [ACA], 2014). The intersectionality framework is considered to be a useful tool in fostering cultural competence in working with diverse populations within helping professions and has been utilized in doing so (Murray, Pope & Willis, 2016; Sears, 2012). As succinctly outlined by Sears (2012), an intersectional framework: (1) calls attention to the multiple identities, or social locations, that people hold and the consequences of their social locations and identities; (2) is based on the premise that people’s experiences of their multiple social identities is fluid and distinct, and plays a central role in their perceptions, behaviors, and  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        44    beliefs; (3) holds that the combination of identities such as sexuality, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and gender can create unique value and belief systems; and (4) illuminates the importance of social context in examining the social determinants of psychological and physical health.  These tenets provide researchers with useful guidelines as they attend to participants’ intersecting identities in the context of their social environments. Within the realm of empirical research, both qualitative and quantitative researchers have utilized an intersectional theoretical framework in exploring the lives of marginalized populations (Sears, 2102; Shields, 2008). A qualitative methodology, for instance, requires that participants themselves define and describe their own social locations and how they uniquely intersect to oppress them (Sears, 2012). Shields (2008) cautioned that even though behavioral science focuses on intersectionality, it is often done as a perspective on research, as opposed to a theory that drives the research question. Intersectionality, in such cases, is incorrectly understood solely in terms of multiple group memberships, overlooking important factors such as emergent properties and processes (Shields, 2008).   The reality of people’s lives is such that attention to a single identity category cannot sufficiently describe person’s interactions with their social environments and how they are experienced (Shields, 2008).  As noted by Shields (2008), identities, though experienced as stable, were fluid and can change over time. An investigator’s level of analysis determines which aspects of intersectionality to foreground and background in researching persons’ lived experiences (Shields, 2008). In writing about identity politics and violence against women of color, Crenshaw (1991) explicated the difference between structural and political intersectionality (Shields, 2008). Structural intersectionality, according to Crenshaw (1991),  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        45    reflected how persons’ social needs or legal statuses marginalize them as a result of the intersection of their identities (Crenshaw, 1991; Shields, 2008). Crenshaw (1991) noted that within the social, economic, and political worlds, women of color are situated differently and are at a significant disadvantage as a result. Crenshaw (1991) provided an example of intersectionality that occurs when counselors who work to provide crisis intervention for women of color in cases of rape report having to spend a significant portion of the funding on matters unrelated to rape (Shields, 2008). Many agencies allocate funding based on the needs of White, middle-class persons.  Therefore, as a result of the intersection of socioeconomic status, gender, and race, poor women of color are less likely to receive the assistance that they need (Crenshaw, 1991; Shields, 2008).   Political intersectionality, in contrast, highlights the differences and often opposing political agendas of the respective groups to which persons identify (Crenshaw, 1991; Shields, 2008). Crenshaw (1991) noted that, for instance, women of color are positioned within at least two minoritized groups whose political agendas may be in conflict (Crenshaw, 1991; Shields, 2008). Shields (2008) discussed the concept of hybridity, which provides another perspective in understanding intersecting identities. This perspective highlights a unique form of identity that is the result of identity intersections. The concept of hybridity, which has its roots in postcolonial studies, emphasizes the impact of colonialism on indigenous cultures (Shields, 2008). The premise is that whenever cultures make contact, new cultural forms are created. Such contact may be involuntary, in cases of colonialism or voluntary, in cases such as immigration. Nonetheless, the notion of hybridity illuminates the impact that dominant cultures, invasion, and colonization could have on group identity and individuals ’expression of the intersection of their identities (Shields, 2008).  Taking the aforementioned tenets of intersectionality into account,  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        46    this study, in exploring the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians from various Caribbean islands, attends to participants ’intersecting identities such as nationality, race/complexion, socioeconomic and social status, and the complex ways in which their intersecting identities influenced their sexual identity development.  A Brief Overview of the Caribbean and Its People The Caribbean is comprised of 28 territories and refers to islands of the Caribbean Sea, from Cuba to Trinidad and Tobago, including the territories of the Guianas (Guyana, Suriname, and French Gianas), and Belize, which are located in Central America. The nationals of the Caribbean, referred to as West Indians, are a racially and ethnically diverse people with varying religious and spiritual values and practices (Allahar, 1993). The languages and cultural practices of the Caribbean have been shaped by each island’s unique history and legacies of its native peoples (Arawaks, Caribs, Amerindians, and Tainos), European colonialism, the African heritage of enslaved people, and indentured servitude of East Indian and Chinese peoples (Allahar, 1993; Hylton, 2002).  The colonial presence of Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, France, and the Netherlands is undoubtedly evident in Caribbean societies’ laws, cultural values, and cultural practices. For instance, even though no single religion is ascribed to the Caribbean as an entity, the power of the Christian Church (Roman Catholicism of the Spanish, Portuguese and French Empires, and the Protestantism of the British and Dutch) during the colonial period in dominating the native Indians and enslaved Africans has preserved a lasting impact in each Caribbean island (Allahar, 1993; Hylton, 2002). Islam and Hindu, brought to the region largely by East Indian indentured servants, have maintained a rich cultural and religious presence in islands such as British and French Guiana, Trinidad, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Suriname, and Jamaica (Heauman, 2006;  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        47    Hylton, 2002). Despite the approximate 139,000 Chinese people who arrived to the region as indentured servants between 1852 and 1912, the religions of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism have not thrived in comparison to other religions. Nevertheless, a significant Chinese representation has been maintained in countries such as Jamaica and Guyana (Heauman, 2006; Hylton, 2002).  Describing Caribbean culture is no easy task. On one hand, the Caribbean islands may be considered culturally and ethnically fragmented, despite collaborating in the pursuit of meeting economic needs (Allahar, 1993). On the other hand, the Caribbean may be viewed as diverse, a region of ongoing creolization of cultures in which separate European, African, East Indian, and Chinese descendants systematically blend to form a West Indian culture, which transcends nationalism (Allahar, 1993). Allahar (1993) underscored that, despite these varying perspectives, there is indeed a shared history of slavery and colonialism, cultural traditions, tastes in food, music, dance, dress, and other aspects of popular culture. Yet, the tendency to regard the entire Caribbean region and its cultures as an undifferentiated entity is a misrepresentation of each island’s unique society. Thus, the insular identities and distinctiveness of each island should not be ignored (Allahar, 1993). In this vein, homophobia in the Caribbean is nuanced. The literature has consistently depicted the region as homophobic, citing religious values, laws that prohibit same-sex sexual behavior, and the absence of laws that protect same-gender loving persons from discrimination (Cowell & Saunders, 2011; West & Cowell, 2015). Yet, scholars have suggested that there is variance in the degrees of tolerance toward same-gender loving persons among the Caribbean islands, influenced by each island’s colonial past (Couzens et al., 2017). Jamaica, compared to other Caribbean nations, has been known for murders and other hate crimes against same-gender  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        48    loving people (Cowell & Saunders, 2011; West & Cowell, 2015). Yet, little empirical research exists on societies and individual experiences of same-gender loving persons of Caribbean islands beyond Jamaica. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians from various Caribbean islands and in doing so, honor the cultural similarities as well as societal differences of participants’ respective islands. Review of Empirical Studies Terms of Literature Review Similar to any literature review, my review of literature on the topic of sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians was comprised of a combination of journal articles that were retrieved from search engines and published books. For journal articles, I searched the PsycInfo thesaurus for subject terms that captured the construct of sexual identity.  These terms (in PsycInfo) are “gender identity” or “sexual orientation” or “sexual attraction” or “sexual attitudes.” This resulted in 28,130 results (as of September 14, 2019). Next, I searched the PsycInfo thesaurus for subject terms that capture the construct of same gender loving.  These terms (in PsycInfo) are “LGBTQ” or “bisexuality” or “homosexuality.” This resulted in 16,520 results (as of September 14, 2019). Next, I combined these searches “gender identity” or “sexual orientation” or “sexual attraction” or “sexual attitudes” and “LGBTQ” or “bisexuality” or “homosexuality,”  which resulted in 4443 hits.  Next, I limited to English, which resulted in about 100 fewer hits. Finally, I added keywords and combined it with the above search: “West Indies” or Caribbean or Antigua or Barbados or Bahamas or Grenada or Guyana or Jamaica or “St, Kitts” or “St. Lucia” or “St. Vincent” or “Trinidad.” This resulted in 24 hits.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        49    To broaden the search, I flipped all of the subject/descriptor terms over to keywords, added a few more key terms (such as “sexual identity”) and this resulted in 99 hits. The final search string was: “Gender Identity” or “Sexual Orientation” or “Sexual Attraction” or “Sexual Attitudes” or “Sexual Identity” AND ( “LGBTQ” OR “bisexuality” OR “homosexuality”) AND (“West Indies” or Caribbean or Antigua or Barbados or Bahamas or Grenada or Guyana or Jamaica or “St Kitts” or “St. Lucia” or “St. Vincent” or Trinidad). Next, searches were repeated (using the same search string) in Academic Search Complete and ProQuest Psychology.  There were 74 and 623 hits, respectively, most of which were not relevant to the topic under study. For the review of literature, the criteria for inclusion were studies that explored the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. I excluded all studies that did not pertain to the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. After reviewing the results, five empirical studies met the criteria for review. In addition, I utilized the reference lists of these studies to source additional studies for review. As a result, a total of eight empirical studies will be reviewed in this review of the literature. One study which did not meet the criteria for inclusion will be referenced for the relevance of its findings to the current study. There are several limitations in the literature regarding the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. Although sexual identity development scholarship has gained momentum in empirical research since the 1960s, there is a lack of information on the experiences of diverse same-gender loving West Indians. As noted by Couzens and colleagues (2017), much of the existing research on the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians reflect the Caribbean island of Jamaica whereas small island states, such as Antigua and Barbuda, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and others have not been well-represented in empirical research (Braunchweiger, 2018). Given the complexity of each Caribbean island’s history, societal values, and variance in the  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        50    enforcement of buggary and gross indecency laws (Braunchweiger, 2018), considering the experiences of West Indians from various islands can provide valuable insight into the shared experiences of sexual identity development of this population.  Introduction Traditional models of sexual identity development, such as Cass (1979, 1984) and McCarn and Fassinger (1996), reflected a linear perspective, which suggested a hierarchy of ordered stages and statuses of development. Modern conceptualizations of the topic, developed by scholars such as D’Augelli (1994) and Mohr and Kendra (2011), reflected a multidimensional perspective that allows for a more in-depth and comprehensive understanding of sexual identity development. Both traditional and modern perspectives of sexual identity development have consistently examined same-gender loving persons’ self-concept in relation to their environment, that is, their society and the world in which they live. Thus, sexual identity development scholars have maintained that same-gender loving persons’ experiences with their society, including societal values, to varying degrees, influence sexual identity development. Notwithstanding the dearth of empirical research on same-gender loving West Indians, the following review of literature is comprised of empirical studies that explore the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians with various societal structures. The review of empirical studies is thematically organized to reflect experiences with health care, education/employment institutions, and family systems and will include a critical analysis of each study’s methodology in reference to the current study. In addition, this review of literature will address prominent identities that intersect with the same-gender loving sexual identity and West Indian ethnicity of same-gender loving persons, all of which will be discussed in the context of sexual identity development.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        51    To explore the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians, this review of literature is based on two overarching premises. First, persons’ interaction and experiences with their environments play an integral role in the development of sexual identity (Cass, 1979, 1984), a position that has withstood the evolution of sexual identity scholarship and has been held by both historical and modern sexual identity development scholars (Mohr & Kendra, 2011). Second, intersectionality, the concept that persons occupy multiple identities that intersect to create unique experiences related to power, privilege, and oppression (Crenshaw, 1989), is applicable to the lives of same-gender loving West Indians. This ought to be considered in exploring this topic, as its absence would provide an incomplete and inaccurate reflection of persons’ experiences (Crenshaw, 1989; Few-Demo, 2016; Shields, 2008). Experiences With Healthcare Institutions This section provides an in-depth discussion of the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians with health care institutions and the implications of such experiences for sexual identity development. I begin with a brief introduction to the topic followed by a review of three empirical studies that pertain to the topic, which I identify numerically. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides guidelines that are related to reducing exclusions and social disparities in health, which include a) structuring and practicing health care around people’s needs and expectations; b) integrating health care into public policy reform; and c) increasing the involvement of stakeholders (Gahagan & Subirana-Malaret, 2018). For same-gender loving persons, however, the issues of exclusion and disparities of health care are particularly significant (Gahagan & Subirana-Malaret, 2018). As noted by Gahagan and Subirana-Malaret (2018), the unique health needs of same-gender loving populations, including those who are transgender, may be excluded from health-related topics and practices, as  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        52    cisgender, heteronormative frameworks have historically been implemented to constitute health care related practices and policies. For same-gender loving West Indians who live under a backdrop of societal heteronormativity and homonegativity sans laws to protect from discrimination within social structures, this is cause for concern. Yet, little research in the region has examined how the local milieu affects the health care experiences of same-gender loving West Indians.   In the first study under review, Rambarran and Simpson (2016) utilized a mixed-methods design to explore the health care experiences encountered by same-gender loving women in Guyana. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 cisgender and transgender women, who were over the age of 18 and identified as non-heterosexual.  Interview questions pertained to health care providers’ attitudes toward their same-gender loving sexual orientation and identities, sexual orientation disclosures to health care providers, provider knowledge and recommendations, and the perceived shortcomings of health care providers and recommendations (Ramberran & Simpson, 2016). The results reflected themes of infrequent utilization of health care facilities; reluctance to disclose sexual orientation; feelings of vulnerability that resulted from a history of disrespectful treatment in the health care system; a lack of discussions regarding sexual health and preventative care; and pathologizing sexual identities (Ramberran & Simpson, 2016). A few participants, for instance, shared that their sexuality was viewed within their Guyanese society as “nasty” and “a stain,” which contributed to their tentative sexuality disclosure to health care providers. In instances when sexuality was disclosed, it was pathologized by doctors as something to be fixed, was dismissed, or humored (Ramberran & Simpson, 2016).   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        53    Rambarran and Simpson’s (2016) study has a variety of strengths and limitations relative to the current study. The qualitative methodology facilitated the sharing of experiences that could not have been captured with quantitative research. However, in relation to this study, it does not specify the design of the qualitative study or a theoretical lens that was utilized, both of which would have provided important contextual information for how data was interpreted and presented. Even though the researchers did well to include both transgender and cisgender women as eligible participants, the sample only included cisgender women. Therefore the results omit the experiences of men and other genders.  The sample for this study (Rambarran & Simpson, 2016) was also obtained from only one region of Guyana and therefore these experiences may not reflect all Guyanese women. The researchers did not ascertain participants’ socioeconomic status, which may be considered another limitation of this study. Utilizing an intersectional lens, socioeconomic status may have been an aspect of the quality of health care experiences they received, which was left unexplored. Perhaps the most significant limitation of this study is that interviews were limited to only 20 minutes. This brief length of time does not facilitate an in-depth exploration of participants’ experiences. Although this study only explores the experiences of same-gender loving women from one Caribbean island, Guyana, this study explored the experiences of same-gender loving persons from various Caribbean islands while utilizing an intersectional lens.  Rambarran and Simpson’s (2016) findings regarding the experiences of same-gender loving Guyanese women with the health care system reflect one aspect of an earlier study on the experiences of at-risk Trinidadian youth. Hasbùn and colleagues (2012) found that 47% of same-gender loving youths felt that they were treated differently by health care providers and only 19% of the same-gender loving participants had utilized health care institutions within the  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        54    previous year (Hasbùn et al., 2012). Although Hasbùn and colleagues’ (2012) study did not meet the criteria for inclusion into this review of literature, the findings illuminate the problematic experiences of some same-gender loving West Indians with health care institutions.  For the second study under review, Logie and colleagues (2016) used qualitative inquiry to explore experiences of same-gender loving and transgender Jamaican youths ’experiences with violence. The results of this study indicated that among the sites of violence toward the participants, health care facilities were included. Participants reported rejection and mistreatment from health care practitioners when they were assumed to be same-gender loving. For instance, a participant reported accompanying a friend who was badly beaten to the hospital. When the nurses learned of the victim’s same-gender loving identity, he was denied treatment (Logie et al., 2016).  In the Logie and colleagues (2016) study, inclusion criteria of both cisgender and transgender persons present a strength of this study. Even though the researchers named and discussed the sexual identity of the cisgender participants, they omitted the sexual identity of transgender participants, which would have been valuable in this discussion of sexual identity experiences. Furthermore, the researchers claimed to explore the experiences of same-loving and transgender youth; however, participants were of the 18 to 29 age range, which is somewhat misleading. Participants for this study were also only recruited in Kingston, which limits the results to only the experiences of Jamaican youth residing in that city of Jamaica. The researchers provided no discussion of socioeconomic status, which would have provided more context to the results, as this intersecting identity may have been an influential factor in the health care resources available to the participants. Finally, this study only reflected the  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        55    experiences of same-gender loving participants of Kingston, Jamaica and is therefore limited to that specific social context.  In the third and final study under review for this section, Rambarran and Grenfell (2016) used a qualitative methodology to explore the professional experiences and perspectives of 10 general practitioners in regard to their same-gender loving patients. The research explored general practitioners’ (GPs) discussions about sexual health and history specific to sexual orientation and gender identity, same-gender loving screening recommendations, confidentiality practices, and training on LGBTQ health. The researchers found that a) GPs facilitated scant discussions of sexual identity, sexual practices, and sexual health with same gender loving patients; b) GPs varied in their understanding of sexual identity and gender identity; c) more than half of the GPs lacked experience with same-gender loving patients, which suggests the invisibility of LGBTQ populations; and d) the invisibility of LGBTQ populations started during their medical school training. Two participants reported that, despite having over five years of experience as a GP in Barbados, they never had an LGBTQ patient. In contrast four other GPs reported having a maximum of two LGBTQ patients when working as GPs in Barbados, although it was not specified the number of years that they were GPs in Barbados. Nevertheless, the results indicated that more than half of the GPs who participated in this study reported having no experience with working with LGBTQ patients despite having extensive health care experience as a health care provider. This also indicates that fewer than half of the GPs knowingly had LGBTQ patients.  As noted by Rambarran and Grenfell (2016), the results of this study reflect the invisibility of the Barbadian LGBTQ community, particularly in relation to the health care community and providing appropriate health care specific to the population, during GPs ’medical  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        56    training. Rambarran and Grendell’s (2016) study, unlike the previously discussed studies, explored the perspectives of mental health practitioners in relation to the same-gender loving identities of their patients in providing appropriate, identity-affirming health care. Sampling for this study was only limited to two parishes in Barbados, further limited to only GPs and those who specialized in family-medicine. These criteria for inclusion eliminated the experiences of other specialized medical professionals, who could have provided more diversity in terms of training and professional experiences. However, a strength of this study is that the researchers selected the sample purposively to reflect diversity in years of professional experience, practice in both private and public sectors, age, and gender. The researchers reported that interviews lasted an average of 22 minutes. This brevity in length significantly limits the depth of information that can be obtained, which calls into question the mere four themes that emerged from this study’s data. Even though this study does provide useful qualitative information regarding the professional practices of GPs practicing in the Caribbean region, it only reflects those practicing on the island of Barbados thus only presenting implications for same-gender loving Barbadians. This study, with an inclusion criterion of same-gender loving West Indians of various Caribbean islands, will in part explore the health care experiences of more than one Caribbean island. Empirical studies outside the Caribbean region, specifically the United States and Canada, which did not fit the criteria for inclusion in this review but contextualize the current study, have also shown that same-gender loving persons frequently experienced barriers within health care settings. Such barriers include non-disclosure or fear of disclosing sexual and gender identity due to discriminatory experiences, lack of cultural competence by health care providers, and inaccessible culturally sensitive resources and referrals (Birnstein et al., 2008; Eliason &  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        57    Schope, 2001; Gahagan & Subirana-Malaret, 2018; Rossman, Salamanca, & Macapagal, 2017), which have been attributed to minority stress, higher rates of chronic diseases, and irregular utilization of health care institutions (Gahagan & Subirana-Malarer, 2018).  As noted by Quinn and colleagues (2015), and as highlighted by each of the studies presented herein, health care institutions play a pivotal role in providing experiences that deny or affirm the identities of same-gender loving persons. Same-gender loving identity disclosure is connected to greater health care satisfaction and health outcomes. In contrast, non-disclosure due to perceived or actual rejection of same-gender loving identity is connected to negative psychological outcomes (Quinn et al., 2015). In exploring the sexual orientation identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians from various islands, this study fills the literature gap by gaining insight into the health care experiences as an aspect of their sexual identity development experiences.  Experiences with Educational and Employment Institutions Given the Caribbean region’s pervasive homonegativity, it may be reasonable to assume that schools reflect these values, as schools are a microcosm of their society (Smith, 2018). However, empirical studies that address the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians in educational spaces remain significantly limited. The following paragraphs within this section review three empirical students that examine the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians with educational and employment institutions. The first is a national study of Jamaica’s school system, conducted by UNICEF (2015), investigated the prevalence of peer abuse (bullying) in Jamaica using a mixed-methods design. In this study, UNICEF (2015) specifically investigated the variables that contribute to bullying among Jamaican youth within school settings and to develop profiles of both the bullies and  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        58    victims. A survey was conducted with 1867 school children from 70 public schools and 174 school personnel, including teachers, administrators, and other staff members from 61 public schools. Qualitative investigations were conducted by in-depth interviews that were facilitated during community-based focus groups. The schools selected were representative of and proportionate to the Ministry of Education’s six school regions.  The results showed that 70% of the students who were in grades 1 to 12 reported that they were bullied during the past year. In the qualitative portion of the study, participants were asked to provide a profile of victims. According to reports, victims are persons who were perceived to be weak or different in any way, including persons who were perceived to be LGBTQ (UNICEF, 2015). Moreover, when requested by a professional organization to address the bullying of students perceived to be LGBTQ, the school administration denied the request in an effort to avoid being stigmatized or labeled as a school in support of LGBTQ students.  UNICEF (2015) provided valuable information on the treatment and perception of same-gender loving youth among their peers on the Caribbean island of Jamaica. The researchers’ sampling technique and criteria for inclusion of both students and teachers of primary and secondary schools across Jamaica provided a comprehensive view of the topic of bullying in that nation. This study, however, does not specifically explore the perspectives and experiences of same-gender loving students, which creates an outsider’s perspective of bullying behaviors toward same-gender youth. This provides an incomplete and one-dimensional view of the bullying experiences of same-gender loving youth in Jamaica. Even though the results of this study are limited to Jamaica’s society, it serves as an impetus to explore the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians ’school-related experiences and the ways in which their experiences influenced their identity development.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        59    Scholars within the United States have developed counseling and mental health guidelines for meeting the needs of same-gender loving students in academic settings. Such guidelines underscore the importance of fostering a safe and identity-affirming learning environment for this population of youth (Goodrich, Harper, Luke & Singh, 2013; Ratts et al., 2013; Harper & Singh, 2013). In Jamaica, however, the head of the island’s school (guidance) counselor union in 2016 contended that, due to buggary laws which deem homosexuality illegal, the Jamaica Teacher’s Association could not call for school (guidance) counselors to be trained to help gay students, as homosexual acts are illegal. The aforementioned statement came after several of the island’s school (guidance) counselors refused to help students who identified as gay and lesbian (“Homosexual Acts are Illegal,” 2016). The UNICEF (2015) findings referred specifically to the experiences of Jamaica’s youth in primary and secondary school. However, in the second study reviewed, Ghisyawn (2016) utilized a combination of qualitative methodologies, specifically subjective mapping exercises, in-depth interviews, and participant observation to explore the queer safe spaces of same-gender loving women in Trinidad. The sample of this study comprised of 40 same-gender loving Trinidadian women of various racial backgrounds, 20 of whom engaged in the subjective mapping exercises and 20 who did not. The findings indicated that participants considered the St. Augustine’s Trinidad campus of the University of the West Indies (UWI) to be a safe space by those who attended. Several participants reported feeling comfortable expressing their same-gender loving identity as part of the Institute for Gender and Development Studies (IGDS) program and on campus, as it was not unusual to see same-sex couples, specifically women, holding hands while walking, or being affectionate in the local coffee shop (Ghisyawan, 2016). These findings suggest that, given the unique arrangement and dynamic of the space, St.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        60    Augustine’s UWI campus was considered to be as a same-gender loving identity-affirming safe space to those who attended.  Even though Ghisyawan’s (2016) study provided useful information regarding the experiences of these same-gender loving persons on a Caribbean island, it only reflected the experiences of women within the specific island of Trinidad. An in-depth presentation of the researcher’s sampling technique also would have provided valuable insight into participants ’approach and motivation for participating in this study. In addition, subjective mapping relies heavily on participants ’mood and mental state of the person engaged in the exercise and may change depending on the time at which the exercise was administered, which is a limitation noted by the researcher.  Logie and colleagues (2016) in their exploration of the lived experiences of violence among 23 same-gender loving persons between 19 and 29 years of age in Jamaica, found that mistreatment extended beyond academic settings to employment settings. The findings of this qualitative study, previously reviewed in relation to experiences with health care institutions, also reflect negative experiences with employment institutions. Participants ’narratives indicated employment institutions as a site of verbal assault, employment discrimination, harassment by employers, and reluctance by employers to hire openly or perceived LGBTQ persons due to anticipated backlash from current and potential customers (Logie et al., 2016). In one case, for instance, a gay male noted his sexual identity as a barrier to becoming a doctor, as he believed that heterosexual Jamaicans would refuse to see a gay doctor (Logie et al., 2016).  A young lesbian expressed being sexually harassed by her employer and upon disclosing her sexual identity she was fired. Another woman who was transgender shared her experience of customers refusing to buy from the store where she was employed as a result of her transgender identity. As  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        61    previously noted, however, this study provided no information on the sexual identity of transgender participants, which limits the degree to which their experiences might be included in the discussion of sexual identity experiences.  Each of the studies previously discussed provide valuable insight into the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians with Caribbean educational institutions. They, however, do not address how such experiences inform the identity development process of same-gender loving West Indians. Experiences with Family   Developmental theories of sexual orientation identity development, such as Cass (1979), Coleman (1982), and Troiden (1988), consider self-disclosure or coming out to be the pinnacle and one of the defining features of having successfully achieved sexual orientation identity development. Alternative perspectives hold that sexual orientation identity development as a lifelong process in which the disclosure of sexual orientation often happens on multiple occasions in various phases of life and influenced by sociocultural factors (D’Augelli, 1994). Moreover, self-disclosure of sexual orientation is not a defining feature of having achieved sexual orientation identity development. Such an expectation places the responsibility of overcoming oppressive heteronormative forces of society on the same-gender loving person (McCarn & Fassinger, 1996). Unique life circumstances, which influence sexual identity development, ought to be considered on an individual basis (White, Sandfort, Morgan, Carpenter, & Pierre, 2016). Two studies that pertain to the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians with family are reviewed within this section. In the first study, White and colleagues (2010) used a mixed-method design to explore the mental illness, specifically the prevalence of Axis 1 disorders based on the DSM IV-TR, and  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        62    associated risk factors, among same gender loving Jamaican men and women. The sample of this study was comprised of 62 men and women who identified as sexual minorities. Participants had to be at least 16 years of age and resided in Jamaica for a minimum of three years. In addition, participants completed a Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-I/NP) instrument and a questionnaire that was constructed by the authors.  White and colleagues (2010) found poor familial relationships to be a primary factor associated with poor mental health with this population. Specifically, the researchers found that negative family experiences related to sexual identity, such as physical abuse, eviction, and openness about sexual orientation were significant contributors to mental health challenges among same-gender loving Jamaicans. Although it is common for same-gender loving persons to disclose their sexual identity to immediate family members later than carefully selected persons (White et al., 2016), White and colleagues (2010) found that the mean age of identity disclosure of same-gender loving Jamaicans to family was 22 years of age, which is almost four years older than the mean age of initial disclosure to non-family members. As noted by White and colleagues, (2010) at 22 years of age persons are often financially independent, but they may also be at a critical life stage where the emotional and financial withdrawal of family members may be detrimental.  White and colleagues’ (2010) study contributed to the knowledge base of mental health concerns among same-gender loving Jamaicans. In fact, it was the first to examine Axis I disorders and associated risk factors among same-gender loving persons from that island. White and colleagues’ (2010) study, though valuable for the information provided, had a few noteworthy limitations. Even though participants were recruited from three counties in Jamaica, the majority of the sample was recruited through support groups and organizations. Because of  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        63    this, the findings may reflect the experiences of persons who were experiencing some psychosocial challenges and therefore do not reflect the experiences of the wider same-gender loving population in Jamaica (White et al., 2010). Another limitation is that the majority of the sample consisted of men. Therefore the results primarily reflected the experiences of men and to a lesser degree, the experiences of women and other genders. In the context of sexual identity development, this study illuminates the influence and impact of familial rejection and acceptance on the emotional and psychological health of same-gender loving Jamaicans, although it does not address sexual identity development specifically. This study, however, serves as a catalyst for future research to explore familial experiences of same-gender loving West Indians from other islands in the context of sexual identity development. Although the results of the White and colleagues (2010) study indicated familial rejection as an associated risk factor for Axis I disorders among same-gender loving Jamaicans, familial relationships were not the focus of the study. White and colleagues (2016) in a follow-up study used a quantitative research design to provide a more in-depth look at sexual identity disclosure to family among same-gender loving men in Jamaica. In this study, which consisted of a sample of 110 same-gender loving men aged 18 to 56 years, only 1 in 3 men disclosed their sexual identity to a family member or someone in his household. White and colleagues (2016) also found that disclosure to family members was greater among men who felt deeply connected with their family or felt that their family would protect them. Disclosure to family was also greater among participants who had more financial independence, higher levels of education, and utilized LGBTQ support organizations. The researchers also found that negative familial response to participants ’sexual identity was distinctly the most significant predictor of depression (White et al., 2016).   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        64    Although White et al. (2016) study provided important information on familial relationships and responses to same-gender loving Jamaican men’s sexual identity, it is not without limitations that must be considered in the context of this study. White and colleagues’ (2016) study sample only consisted of Jamaican men. However, the experiences of same-gender loving Jamaican women and factors surrounding their sexual identity disclosure would have been valuable. The quantitative methodology of this study also provided no anecdotal and contextual information of the statistics, such as whether self-disclosure was self-initiated and the how familial responses influenced their self-acceptance and self-concept. The final and perhaps the most significant limitation, which was noted by the researchers, is that the scales used to measure familial relationships were originally developed by the researchers and lacked standardized validated psychometric tools. Moreover, the reliability of some of the scales was unsatisfactory (White et al., 2016).  As noted by White and colleagues (2016), academic literature is replete with evidence that a lack of familial acceptance, negative or abusive reactions to individuals ’same-gender loving identity is detrimental to mental and physical health. However, there is a void in the literature on the ways in which experiences with familial acceptance and/or rejection informs the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians which my study explores.  Mental Health and Same-Gender Loving West Indians Minority stress theory proposes that persons who are sexual minorities are susceptible to negative psychological health and well-being, which results from the hostility, harassment, and rejection experienced within a homophobic culture (Meyer, 2003, 2007; Meyer, Schwartz, & Frost, 2008). As noted by White and colleagues (2010), researchers have dedicated scholarship to examining the mental health and risk factors among same-gender loving persons (e.g., Bagley  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        65    & D’Augelli, 2000; DeGraaf, Sandfort, & Have, 2006; Huebner, Rebchook, & Kegles, 2004). However, there is a dearth in empirical research that addresses mental health and same-gender loving West Indians. Within this section, two empirical studies are reviewed that pertain to the mental health of same-gender loving West Indians. White and colleagues (2010), previously reviewed in relation to familial experiences, was one of the first studies to examine the prevalence of Axis I disorders and associated risk factors among Jamaican same-gender loving men and women. As previously noted, the researchers used a mixed-methods research design to assess the role and significance of negative experiences, such as abuse and discrimination of a sample of 62 participants. These participants were obtained through convenience sampling from local HIV/AIDS care groups, sexual minority support groups, and human rights groups. Following structured interviews for the DSM-IV-TR, the results of this study indicated that 69% of participants met the DSM-IV-TR for at least one major Axis 1 disorder in their lifetime, with major depressive disorder as the most common diagnosis with 45% of participants having a lifetime prevalence. A cumulative 76% reported having experienced abuse or some form of negative treatment within the previous 12 months with a frequency of more than three times per month for more than half of these participants. Among participants with these negative experiences, only 11% received counseling services.  Openness about one’s sexual orientation, discriminatory and abusive treatment related to sexual orientation, and poor relationships with family was considered the primary risk factors for psychiatric morbidity among the participants.  These findings of the White and colleagues (2010) study paralleled those of Phillip (2013), the second study reviewed within this section. Phillips (2013) used a qualitative research approach to solicit participant responses through an online open-ended questionnaire to explore  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        66    the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, specifically nine Trinidadians ’and Barbadians’, experiences with anxiety and depression. The analysis of data yielded themes related to stressors, the etiology of depression, and the etiology of anxiety. Each participant reported stressors: (1) societal stressors, described as the judgment and social disapproval of being a same-gender loving person in the English-speaking Caribbean; (2) interpersonal stressors, described as the tension experienced with family members and friends because of participants ’sexual identity; (3) religious stressors, described as the conflict and guilt that was often felt when their sexual identity and religious identity intersected; and (4) intrapersonal  stressors, described as internalized oppression as experienced due to their rejecting their same-gender loving identity. Multiple participants discussed their regret with attempting to be heterosexual during their youth instead of self-acceptance (Phillip, 2013). Among the subthemes of the etiology of depression, societal difficulties were a significant contributor. Derogatory epithets and being called names were reported as common triggers. Among the subthemes of the etiology of anxiety, societal difficulties played a significant role. Fear of being identified as a sexual minority living in the Caribbean and fear of being physically harmed and ridiculed were noteworthy concerns.  Coping mechanisms were both interpersonal and intrapersonal, behavioral, pharmacological, and substance use-related.  Participants, for instance, sought peer counsel, such as talking to a friend or a trusted family member, and professional assistance from a psychologist, a social worker, or psychiatrist as their chosen interpersonal coping mechanisms. Intrapersonal coping mechanisms included positive self-talk and thinking, willpower, and prayer (Phillip, 2013).  One of the most significant strengths of Phillip’s (2013) study in relation to the current study was that the sample consisted of participants from more than one Caribbean island,  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        67    Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. Moreover, criteria for inclusion and recruitment, despite the sample make-up, involved various Caribbean islands, including Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago. The qualitative methodology of this study, particularly its Interpretive Phenomenology Analysis (IPA) provided some insight into participants ’experiences with anxiety and depression in relation to their sexual identity. However, the online data collection limited the depth of information that could have been provided, as the researcher was unable to probe for more information (Phillip, 2013). Interviews, in this case, would have been more fitting.    The development of a healthy identity is reciprocally related to psychological well-being. In exploring the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, the findings of the aforementioned studies are invaluable in gaining insight into mental health needs of same-gender loving West Indians and the influence of environmental factors. This study will advance this topic by exploring mental health related experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, particularly in the context of their sexual identity development.  Intersecting Identities  An intersectional lens is crucial to facilitate a comprehensive and thorough understanding of the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. Intersectionality, or the notion that each person holds multiple identities which intersect to provide unique experiences of oppression and privilege, influences how persons experience the world (Sears, 2012; Shields, 2008) and is essential to gaining a true representation of persons’ lived experiences (Crenshaw, 1989). The limited existing literature on the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians also limits the ability of researchers and helping professionals ’ability to conceptualize the ways in which same-gender loving West Indians’ identities conflict  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        68    or complement each other throughout the sexual identity development process. Extant research, however, suggest two prominent identities in the lives of West Indians, which were explored as part of this research. Such identities include spirituality/religion and race/complexion.  Spirituality is defined as the personal experience of transcendence beyond one’s self, whereas religion is defined as the beliefs and rituals based on an institutionally organized system (Pargament, Mahoney, Shafranske, Exline, & Jones, 2013). Both constructs play an integral role in the lives of many people, including those who identify as same-gender loving (Beagan & Hattie, 2015; Halkins et al., 2009). Some researchers (e.g., Beagan & Hattie, 2015; Wood & Conley, 2014) suggested that navigating the intersections of sexual orientation and religious identity pose a challenge to same-gender loving persons who experience guilt, shame, rejection of a same-gender loving sexual identity, delayed sexual activity, rejection from a religious community, and loss of religious or spiritual identities. Researchers (e.g., Rosenkratz, Rostosky, Riggle, & Cook, 2016; Walker & Longmire-Avital, 2013) found positive aspects of intersecting religious/spiritual identities with same-gender loving identities, such as love and acceptance of one’s identities, empathy, openness, positive relationships with family members and religious community, and spiritual strength to self-disclose their sexual identity and cope with social stigma and rejection.  For same-gender loving West Indians, little is known regarding their intersecting religious/spiritual identities and sexual identity. What is known are inferences that may be drawn from the limited research that exists on the homonegative prejudice in the Caribbean, which positions religion as a significantly influential aspect of the social rejection of same-gender loving West Indians (Chadee et al., 2013; West & Cowell, 2015). This void in empirical research coupled with the previously discussed findings on religion/spirituality calls into question the  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        69    religious/spiritual experiences of same-gender loving West Indians as they navigated their identity development process, which this study addressed.  Research findings also suggest that due to cultural factors, such as racism within a predominantly White society, the sexual identity development process can be complicated for same-gender loving racial/ethnic minorities (Rosario, Schrimshaw, & Hunter, 2004; Saven-Williams, 1996). For same-gender loving West Indians, those who have migrated and residents alike, the issue of race is also an important topic. Although the Caribbean is predominantly comprised of people of color, colorism, or the sociocultural hierarchy based on skin-shade, is a psychosocial issue in Afro-Caribbean societies. Colorism systematically functions to assign privilege to White and light-skinned persons, and promote prejudice and discrimination toward dark-skinned persons (Couzens et al., 2017).  Given the Caribbean’s homonegative attitudes toward same-gender loving persons, coupled with the issue of colorism, it is worth exploring the ways in which race/complexion and sexual identity intersect during the sexual identity development process of same-gender loving West Indians. One known study conducted by Couzens and colleagues (2017) qualitatively explored experiences of homophobia among same-gender loving St. Lucians. The researchers found skin-color orientated acceptance of same-gender loving identity, which reflected that participants reported that they experienced and observed more acceptance toward-light skinned, same-gender loving St. Lucians. Conversely, dark-skinned, same-gender loving St. Lucians reported more experiences with discrimination, rejection, and psychological distress than their light-skinned peers (Couzens et al., 2017). These findings present significant implications for the identity development process as persons navigate their social environments with self-acceptance.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        70    Although this study and its findings represent same-gender loving St. Lucians, it warrants further exploration to include the experiences of West Indians from other Caribbean territories.  Chapter Summary  In this chapter, I reviewed a variety of literature relevant to the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians. I began with discussing in-depth pertinent psychosocial and sexual identity development theoretical frameworks. Thereafter, I provided a review of existing literature on the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, discussing the implications on identity development. The empirical studies that were reviewed in this chapter illuminate the lack of culturally responsive, identity-affirming practices by healthcare professionals in the Caribbean (Logie et al., 2016; Rambarran & Grenfell, 2016; Rambarran & Simpson’s, 2016), and hostility that same-gender loving students (and students perceived to be same-gender loving) experience in primary and secondary schools. (UNICEF, 2015). Further, findings suggest that familial relationships play a significant role in the lives of same-gender loving West Indians and poor familial, coupled with homonegative experiences, contribute to poor mental health outcomes for this population (Phillip, 2013; White et al. 2010; White et al., 2016). Lastly, race and complexion are influential in the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, as findings suggest that it in the Caribbean, it easier to be light skinned or White and same-gender loving than Black or dark-skinned and same-gender loving (Couzens et al., 2017). In chapter three, I will discuss in-depth my research methodology and design, data collection and analysis, and trustworthiness of the study.     TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        71    Chapter 3: Methodology The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians and their meaning making of this process. To achieve this, a general qualitative research design, utilizing ethnographic interviewing was employed. This approach is most fitting because it facilitates an in-depth exploration of participants’ or natives’ sexual identity development and in so doing centers culture and social context in understanding this process from the perspectives of participants. I believe that the depth of information obtained from this study provides the necessary contextual information that would benefit the work of helping professionals and educators in understanding the lived experiences of same-gender loving West Indians during their sexual identity development.  Within the following paragraphs, I provide my researcher stance, the research design, data collection and analysis processes, plans for participant recruitment, and trustworthiness of this study.  I close this chapter with a discussion of the limitations and delimitations of this study. Positionality I am an Afro-Caribbean cisgender same-gender loving woman who was raised on the Caribbean island of Antigua. I grew up in an upper-middle to upper-class suburban neighborhood and attended private school until high school. I was very involved in my church, as a member of the church’s youth choir and have always considered myself to be a proud practicing Anglican. Recognizing and understanding my own sexual identity, which began during my adolescence, was a time of period of tremendous confusion and shame, influenced by the negative messages that I received from my society about LGBTQ+ persons. Caribbean  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        72    music, specifically dancehall, church sermons, and my own observations of the negative treatment of same-gender loving persons all had a significant impact in my understanding of my sexual identity. Moving to the United States at the age of 16 facilitated my first real exposure to same-gender loving persons and positive images of persons within this community, which had a significant positive influence on my own self-understanding and self-acceptance.   My underlying assumption is that, given the sociocultural and sociopolitical factors faced by same-gender loving West Indians, sexual identity development involves a great deal of interpersonal and intrapersonal conflict. As a counselor and scholar, I have an in-depth understanding of sexual identity development which, along with my own experiences, inform my preconceived notions and biases about the sexual orientation and sexual identity of same-gender loving West Indians. Given my own experiences and knowledge related to the topic of sexual identity development it was imperative for me to examine my own understandings of the topic and interrogate the ways in which my preconceived notions could unintentionally influence this study (Hays & Wood, 2011; Merriam & Tisdell, 2015).   Rationale for Research Approach  As previously discussed, there is a dearth of empirical research that addresses the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. Same-gender loving West Indians face marginalization within their respective societies as a result of colonial laws and values, which render them invisible at best. As noted by Creswell and Poth (2017), qualitative research is particularly appropriate when silenced voices need to be heard and when the complexities of an issue need to be explored in depth, all of which cannot be easily measured through quantitative research.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        73    It was therefore fitting that a qualitative research design, which employed ethnographic interviewing, was used to explore the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians. Ethnographic interviewing is a key component of ethnography, which is the scientific description of a culture (Spradly, 1979). A core component of this form of qualitative research is to learn and gain insight into the customs and ways of life from the points of view of the native people (Spradley, 1979). Culture, as described by Spradley (1979), refers to “the acquired knowledge that people use to interpret experience and generate social behavior” (p. 5). It is not possible to directly observe the knowledge that people have learned as members of a particular group and thus, qualitative researchers go beyond what may be seen or heard in order to make inferences about what people know (Spradley, 1979).  Ethnographic interviewing is a complex dialogue, or speech events, between researchers and participants aimed at describing in great depth natives ’cultural knowledge from their unique points of view. To achieve this, the ethnographic interviewing process involves three critical ethnographic elements: 1) explicit purpose, which involves the researcher intentionally informing and reminding participants of the direction of each interview; 2) ethnographic explanations, which illuminates participants ’roles as the teacher of their culture and the researcher’s role in explaining critical aspects of the study such as the objective, data recording details, and the use of language to describe aspects of culture; and 3) ethnographic questions, which facilitate the rich description of culture in its own terms (Spradley, 1979). In conjunction with Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems model, this research approach allows for examination of persons ’experiences at various levels of society, illuminating cultural influences, which was conducted during the data collection and analysis processes.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        74    This study centers culture and social context in exploring and gaining insight into the lived experiences that inform the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians. Thus, ethnographic interviewing is uniquely designed to obtain in-depth descriptions about participants ’cultural knowledge/experiences and native language (Spradley, 1979) in relation to sexual identity. Participants and Recruitment As the researcher and primary research instrument in this study, I was interested in understanding the experiences that inform the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians of all genders. Participant recruitment for this study was therefore purposeful and criterion-based (Merrian & Tisdell, 2015). To facilitate the gathering of deep, rich, descriptive data, the criteria for eligibility required that participants self-identify as any aspect of same-gender loving, were at least 23 years of age, and have gone through primary and at least part of secondary school in the Caribbean.  In addition, they must have resided in the Caribbean or had migrated to another country after the age of 13 and were available to participate in a brief screening survey and two interviews, which were conducted on two different days. The rationale for the criteria was to ensure that participants have been directly and extensively immersed in a Caribbean society during critical points of their psychosocial development, from infancy through adolescence, when tasks such as gaining a personal sense of self and identity by actively exploring values and beliefs ensues (Erikson, 1962, 1968).  My rationale for the age requirement was to ensure that participants were of consenting age for participation in this study. I also wished to recruit participants who have gained experience with as many social systems and contexts throughout their lives, such as academic institutions, employment, housing, and religious institutions. I considered the fact that West  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        75    Indians typically graduate high school by age 16 and that post-secondary trajectories tend to vary for a variety of reasons. Requiring that participants be at least 23 years of age was to allow for the likelihood that participants had experiences with the aforementioned social systems.  Participants for this study were recruited through email (see Appendix B) and flyer (see Appendix C), which were shared with personal friends and colleagues, on my personal social media pages (specifically Facebook and Instagram), as well as Facebook groups (such as Gays of the Caribbean, Intersect, ECADE Eastern Caribbean Alliance, United and Strong St. Lucia, CARIFLAGS LGBTQ Forum, and the Caribbean Studies Association’s Caribbean Sexualities Working Group).  Lastly, I relied heavily on snowball sampling as a strategy of recruitment. Given the homonegativity faced by many same-gender loving West Indians within their respective societies, snowball sampling was particularly useful and effective technique for prospective participants to be informed of this study by trusted individuals or persons with whom they are familiar. Potential participants were asked to contact me electronically at which time a screening interview to determine their eligibility was scheduled (see Appendix D).   As noted by Merriam and Tisdell (2015), in determining a suitable sample number, researchers must be able to answer the research question(s) while taking into consideration available resources and the type of data gathered. There were 25 persons in the pool of potential participants. Given the qualitative design of this study, which involved the gathering and transcription of in-depth information, 12 participants were recruited for this study. This allowed for the gathering of rich descriptive data, with enough participants to conduct a thematic analysis of the data.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        76    The first 12 persons who expressed an interest in participating in the study were considered for screening, with the intention of having at least two representatives from each at least three different Caribbean island, which occurred organically. Due to unforeseen circumstances following the screening process, prior to the initial interview, one participant needed to withdraw from the study. As a result, this study had 11 participants from the islands of Antigua, Barbados, Guyana, and Jamaica. Participants were intentionally stratified such that one Caribbean island or gender is not overly represented. To avoid a demographic overrepresentation or outliers, I was intentional about ensuring that my sample had a variety of Caribbean islands and age ranges from a pool of potential participants. Participants demographics are provided in Table 1.

In so doing, ethnographic questions, through a predetermined interview guide (see Appendix A), were employed to foreground social and cultural contextual factors that relate to participants ’sexual identity development. As prescribed by Spradley (1979), descriptive questions, structural questions, and contrast questions are the three main types of ethnographic questions that I employed in this study. Descriptive questions allowed for the ongoing collection and exploration of participants ’use of language in exploring the study’s topic (Spradley, 1979). Structured questions facilitated insight into the basic units of participants ’cultural knowledge, referred to as domains, and the ways in which they have organized their cultural knowledge (Spradley, 1979). Contrast questions facilitated insight into the meaning of various terms that are used in participants ’native language, which provides rich contextual information that relates to the topic of study (Spradley, 1979). As previously noted, participants indicated their interest in participating in this study by emailing me and by using the Google Forms link available on the recruitment flyer to provide contact information, a date, time, and the best mode of communication (phone, email, Google Hangouts, Skype, Zoom, or WhatsApp) for a brief screening interview. On this form,  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        78    participants had the option to provide a pseudonym, which would be used to protect their anonymity. A brief 10- to 15-minute screening interview was conducted with each prospective participant via phone. To verify participants ’eligibility for participating in this study, the screening questionnaire included questions that pertain to the inclusion criteria. Once participants met the criteria for this study, they were asked to complete and sign the Informed Consent (see Appendix E) and return via email or in-person prior to the initial interview. In addition, participants were asked to schedule a date and time for the initial interview.  Each of the two semi-structured interviews was conducted with each participant at a mutually agreed upon time and location. Due to the geographic location of each participant, interviews, in most cases, were conducted online via video conference. In such cases, participants were made aware of the limitations to confidentiality of online conferencing prior to the interview process. Of the 11 participants, eight resided in the Caribbean, while three resided in the United States. There was only one in-person interview, which took place in a private breakout room of an academic building of Montclair State University. The participant was made aware of the limitations to confidentiality when meeting and being interviewed in public places.   The predetermined interview guide provided structure to the interview processes with flexibility that allowed participants to share additional information. Each interview lasted between 60 and 90 minutes and was recorded using a digital audio recording device. The digital audio recording of each interview was transferred to an encrypted, password protected computer owned by me, the lead investigator. The interviews were stored in a locked case unless they were being used. The transcription of interviews was outsourced to a reputable professional transcription company, Rev, that agreed to utilize secure, encrypted data transmission, and to delete each interview after the successful transcription.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        79    D’Augelli’s (1994) theory of sexual identity development informed the questions on the interview guide, which facilitated inquiry into the six sexual identity development processes posited by D’Augelli’s (1994). Thus, interview questions explored participants’ experiences with exiting heterosexuality, developing a personal same-gender loving status, developing a same-gender loving social identity, becoming a same-gender loving offspring, developing a same-gender loving intimacy status, and entering a same-gender loving community (D’Augelli’s, 1994).  In conjunction with ethnographic interviewing, D’Augelli’s (1994) theory allowed for a multidimensional view of their sexual identity development experiences within the context of their native culture. Moreover, utilizing an intersectional lens facilitated an in-depth exploration of the complex ways in which participants ’multiple and intersecting identities influence the development of their sexual identities (Crenshaw, 1991).  Semi-structured interviews facilitated an element of structure to guide the interview but were flexible enough for participants to provide pertinent information, insights, or questions that are outside of the predetermined guide.  Following the data analysis of the initial interviews (detailed in the following section), a second interview was conducted with each participant, which allowed me to ask follow-up questions and share preliminary themes that were identified from the initial interviews for their feedback. Participants also had an opportunity to provide any additional thoughts and experiences that were not covered in the initial interview.       TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        80    Data Analysis The aim of the data analysis process was twofold: to identify themes of participants ’sexual identity development experiences and to uncover the cultural meanings that have influenced participants ’sexual identity development. Thus, the data analysis process was ongoing from the onset of data collection. During each interview, I identified words and phrases that stood out in relation to the topic under study. In part, this served as an initial step in identifying similarities in participants ’experiences. Through the technique of open coding of each transcribed interview, I worked to summarize, condense, and reduce the data to units, which represented the core meaning of the excerpt or vignette through one code word or phrase (Saldaña, 2016). These strategies were implemented with the use of the computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS), Dedoose, which created and stored the codebook for this study.  The next stage of the data analysis process involved identifying categories that emerged with the contextual factors that give meaning to participants’ experiences (Saldaña, 2016). An integral component of this study was to illuminate the role of social and cultural context in participants’ sexual identity development process. To facilitate this, the categorization techniques of the data analysis process drew heavily on Spradley’s (1979) ethnographic analysis. For each code in my codebook, I established a universal semantic relationship, which is the linking of a cover term (each of my codes) with a smaller category of knowledge (Spradley, 1979). Spradley (1979) identified nine useful semantic relationships, which were utilized in the categorization process: a) Strict Inclusion, X is a kind of Y; b) Spatial, X is a place in Y, X is a part of Y; c) Cause and Effect, x is a result of Y, X is a cause of Y; d) Rationale, X is a reason for Y; d) Location for action, x is a place for doing Y; e) Function, X is used for Y; f) Means-End, X is a  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        81    way to do Y; g) Sequence, X is a step (stage) in Y; and h) Attribution, X is an attribute (characteristic) of Y. For example, semantic relationships from my codebook included: a) Cultural expressions as homonegative is a result of homonegative cultural values; b) Gendered code of conduct is a result of societal gender norms, and c) Christian dominant societal values are a result of colonialism and evangelicalism.  From the established semantic relationship, I created categories and subcategories. To achieve this, I drew on Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems model to establish the individual and societal level in which participants ’social interactions, cultural messages and intrapersonal experiences were taking place. I analyzed for commonalities in experiences with various institutions, cultural messages, and intrapersonal experiences, from which categories and subcategories were created and named. I further analyzed for complex patterns in participants’ experiences with various institutions at the individual level and of various levels of society, from which I identified and named themes and subthemes. Trustworthiness To ensure the credibility of this study, I engaged in various activities from the onset of this study. As previously noted, I interrogated my own sexual identity development experiences as a same-gender loving West Indian and consistently examined how my own experiences may unconsciously influence or blind my view of the data. I therefore engaged in reflexive journaling to critically reflect on my experiences, which served to process my biases, assumptions, and personal reactions throughout the research process, particularly after each interview and throughout the data analysis process (Merriam & Tisdell, 2015).  During the second interview, I shared with each participant my preliminary findings of my analysis of data from the first round of interviews with all participants. Participants  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        82    provided their feedback and shared their perspectives on these findings in relation to their individual experiences. I also identified four key informants to engage in member checking who were provided with the findings of the thematic analysis for their feedback on my interpretation of their lived experiences (Merriam & Tisdell, 2015). One participant from each of the four Caribbean islands represented in this study was selected as a key informant and based on their expressed interest in reviewing the findings of this study. Each key informant was provided with a copy of the findings of this study to which they provided feedback. Feedback from key informants was positive, having expressed that they each saw themselves and their experiences in the findings and no changes were suggested. I also identified and worked with three critical friends with whom I consulted and independently reviewed my thematic analysis and provided me with feedback. Critical friends were also consulted during the data collection process to discuss any reactions that I may have during the process. My critical friends were trusted colleagues who have completed a doctoral degree, or were in the process of completing a doctoral degree, and agreed to assist me with this process.  Chapter Summary In this chapter, I outlined the methodology and research design used in this study. I began by restating the research purpose of this study and situating myself in relation to this study’s topic in my positionality statement. I then provided a rationale for the general qualitative research design and ethnographic interviewing technique that was used for this study. Next, I discussed my recruitment strategies and sampling, followed by data collection procedures. I then delineated the data analysis process, and concluded with a discussion of the trustworthiness of this study. In the following chapter, chapter four, I will present the findings of this study.    TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        83     Chapter 4: Findings In the previous chapter, I provided a detailed outline of the process through which I collected and analyzed my data. In so doing, I provided my researcher stance in relation to sexual identity development and provided a rationale for the selected research design. Further, I outlined the strategies that I utilized to maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of this study during the data collection and analysis phases through bracketing my own sexual identity development experiences, member checking, and triangulation. In this chapter, I will present the results of my thematic analysis from two semi-structured interviews with 11 same-gender loving West Indian participants.  Findings  There is a dearth of empirical research that explore the lived experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. Even though researchers have explored the topic of sexual identity development as early as the 1970s (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005), existing literature on this topic does not specifically reflect the experiences of same-gender loving persons from the Caribbean, a region that has become known in part for staunch systemic homonegativity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians to help inform the practice of counselors and allied helping professionals. The research question that framed this study was: What experiences inform the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians? From the qualitative thematic analysis, I have identified three overarching themes, two of which include subthemes. For reference to participants’ identities and other contextual information when reading of their lived experiences, Table 1 in chapter three provides a summary of participants’ demographics.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        84     Each of the three themes and related subthemes represent the lived experiences that have informed the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians. The themes are as follows: Theme 1): Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be; Theme 2): What People Go Say? with subthemes Internalized Barriers to Self-Acceptance and Living Under the Radar; Theme 3): I’m Here and Queer! with subthemes Societal Affirmations, I Am Not alone, and I’m Free to Be Me.  The following paragraphs will present the three overarching themes and related subthemes that were identified from a thematic analysis of the study’s findings. The conceptual presentation of the themes and subthemes ought not to be understood as linear. Instead, they are presented as dimensions of participants’ identity development experiences. As such, the first theme, Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, reflects participants’ experiences with a variety of social institutions that function collaboratively to deliver and uphold homonegative societal values and messages regarding the acceptability of same-gender loving identities and behaviors, in conjunction with other social identities. The second theme, What People Go Say? and its related subthemes, and the third theme, I’m Here and Queer, along with its related subthemes, represent how societal messages and their related experiences have been internalized to influence their concepts and expression of self, all of which are fluid and contextual. Moreover, the third theme, I’m Here and Queer and related subthemes, do not presume self-disclosure or denote a sexual identity development finale. Instead, they reflect participants’ experiences with self-affirmation and space-making as same-gender loving West Indians. In the following section, I provide an in-depth discussion of the first theme, Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, that will include vignettes that illustrate participants’ experiences.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        85    Theme 1: Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be Participants in this study spoke extensively of the ways in which social structures, such as the family, the church and related social entities, primary and secondary schools and other societal institutions, such as their places of employment, seamlessly work to dictate and police who they are and ought to be. Unlike primary and secondary institutions, participants’ experiences suggested that tertiary education institutions, such as the University of the West Indies, were more liberal and accepting of same-gender loving West Indians, evident in the third theme, I’m Here and Queer! Nevertheless, as part of heteronormative Caribbean societies, academic institutions were not void of heteronormative values by faculty and administration. Embedded in this theme are colonial values of who is an ideal citizen, Christian, child, family member, specifically in the context of sexual identity. Caribbean social structures, according to participants, promote heteronormativity and homonegativity, which through their lived experiences within their respective islands, have provided cultural messages that reject their same-gender loving identities. Moreover, these social institutions are equipped with sanctions that work to reinforce homonegativity.  This first theme, Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, reflects how social institutions communicate that participants are citizens of Christian nations, guided by Christian principles, which is also intricately connected to their citizenship as Caribbean nationals. Christian teachings and practices are interwoven into societal norms and practices and are inescapable, as there is no separation of church and state. Thus, to be an ideal citizen poses a significant challenge to participants as same-gender loving West Indians and their sexual identities, as culturally, Biblical interpretations denounce homosexuality, condemning homosexuals to hell. These paradoxical positions required participants as same-gender loving  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        86    West Indians to question and negotiate their nationalism and sexual identity which are in conflict. To be an ideal Caribbean citizen is to formally or informally embrace Christian heteronormative values and practices, which contradicts their identities as same-gender loving West Indians.  For example, Randy a 32-year-old man from Barbados, who identifies as gay, expressed that there is no separation of church and state, which influenced so many aspects of his life as a gay man in the Caribbean. Due to the lack of separation of church and state, Randy described his same-gender loving identity and behaviors as “wrong,” noting “it’s not just one count, it’s two counts. It kind of feels like you’re breaking two laws”. Randy further shared how social institutions reciprocally reinforced heteronormative and homonegative values stating, Essentially what is right in the church is also law to some degree. It's not just the feeling of disappointing your family's beliefs and traditions, it's also thinking: oh, this is genuinely wrong because the law states. But the law is very much based on Christian beliefs Connected to, but unique from, the homonegative religious nationalism faced by same-gender loving West Indians, is the hostility experienced from religious leaders in the church. While religious nationalism occurred on a macro level, participants’ negative experiences with religious leaders occurred on a micro, personal level. Through experiences with religious leaders in the church, homonegative messages were directly delivered to participants, which communicated that they are not welcome in the church and that the church was not a safe place for them. While participants received the message that they are excluded from the church, the hostility was not uniformed. Participants’ experiences ranged from overt messages instructing congregants to harm same-gender loving people to covert messages through microaggressions.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        87    The family as a social institution also communicated that heterosexuality is expected and that homosexuality is not. Such expectations were instilled from childhood and were influential in how same-gender loving West Indians viewed themselves in relation to heterosexual family members, who by virtue of their heterosexual identity, met familial expectations while the same-gender loving persons did not. Across participants’ experiences, familial messages of heteronormativity varied and included subtle heteronormative jokes, explicit directives, punishment, and marginalization for being or being perceived to be same-gender loving. While the family is a separate social institution, it did not operate independently, but in concert with the societal value system of the Christian nations that governed it. Familial expectations were also rooted in the teachings of the church, led by homonegative religious leaders.  As social structures coalesced to convey heteronormative expectations of each island’s citizens, participants spoke of the political barriers that they faced in the form of social sanctions that police homosexuality. Despite existing laws that criminalize homosexual sexual behaviors, participants suggested that those laws did not directly impact their day-to-day lives. Instead, participants referenced their islands’ governing Christian organization as significantly influential in the policies, present in the schools (both public and private schools) and the public sector, that promote heterosexuality and intentionally prohibit homosexuality, all functions of the Christian- island-states. For participants as same-gender loving West Indians, cultural prescriptions of acceptable behaviors for men and women influence their sexual identities. Participants shared experiences with a heteronormative gendered code of conduct whereby men cannot be feminine and women cannot be masculine, which culturally signified homosexuality. Expressions or behaviors perceived to reflect homosexuality were problematic in the participants’ Christian nations. As a  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        88    result, participants as same-gender loving West Indians were required to navigate social institutions abiding by the rules of culturally prescribed heteronormative gender expression for personal advancement and in some cases, safety. Gender expression was also salient in the lives of participants as feminine women and masculine men were assumed to be heterosexual, which worked to either shield them from homophobic discrimination or render them invisible within the same-gender loving community. Caribbean social structures collaboratively convey that its ideal citizens of Christian nations are heterosexual, a message that is also conveyed within the society-at-large. Participants expressed experiences with discrimination which communicated that, as same-gender loving persons, they do not belong and are undeserving of occupying space within their respective societies and institutions. Colonial remnants of racial hierarchy also informed participants’ sexual identity development experiences. Participants shared experiences with colorism and expressed that, in the Caribbean, it is easier to be same-gender loving if you are White or light-skinned, as they are deemed more desirable and attractive. Dark-skinned same-gender loving persons are therefore further marginalized due to the intersection of their sexual identity and complexion. The message that dark-skinned persons are less attractive and desirable was internalized for some participants, which negatively influenced their self-esteem and self-image. The collaboration of social structures to convey expectations of heterosexuality informed participants’ sexual identity development experiences. This theme was made evident by participants’ experiences with being tasked with self-negotiating who they are and who they are expected to be. The complexity of participants’ experiences was such that their experiences with the various social institutions were not monolithic. Heteronormative messages were conveyed in nuanced and diverse ways. Some messages were conveyed through direct experiences, while  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        89    others were indirect through observations of others and the implicit indoctrination of heteronormative societal values. Moreover, social institutions in and of themselves are also not monolithic and change over time. For instance, despite familial expectations of heterosexuality, familial affirmation played a significant role in participants’ self-acceptance, which is reflected in the Societal Affirmations subtheme of the subsequent theme, I’m Here and Queer!  This theme, Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, reflect only the societal messages that reject homonegativity, which works in part to inform same-gender loving West Indians’ sexual identity development experiences. The further dimensions of participants’ experiences, which include the impact of homonegative societal messages and the self-acceptance as same-gender loving West Indians, are captured by the two subsequent themes, What People Go Say? and I’m Here and Queer! In the following paragraphs, I will provide an in-depth discussion of this theme. To that end, I will discuss societal messages that participants received from various social institutions of what is expected from an ideal citizen, Christian, child, and family member. Such messages convey whom participants can and cannot be in relation to their same-gender loving identity, including the consequences of their transgressions. The detailed discussion will unpack and provide vignettes that illustrate the messages that participants received,  specifically that they: live in Christian nations and must therefore live according to Christian doctrine; are excluded from the church and will face hostility from religious leaders; are expected to be heterosexual by parents and family members; are sanctioned by various social and institutional policies that obstruct homosexuality; are expected abide by a culturally prescribed gendered code of conduct; are taught, through personal experience and observation, that White and light-skinned same- TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        90    gender loving persons are more accepted than Black and dark-skinned same-gender loving persons; and are undeserving of existing in Caribbean spaces.  Christian nations. Each participant (n = 11) described their respective island as a Christian nation in which Christian values and beliefs that reject homosexuality are espoused and interwoven into social systems and inevitably into the lives of participants as same-gender loving West Indians. Participants further described a lack of separation of church and state, as Christian teachings and practices are implemented throughout various social intuitions.  This is exemplified by prayers and Biblical readings at the beginning of each parliamentary sitting, the recitation of prayers throughout the day within government primary and secondary schools, and the custom of beginning staff meetings with payer at employment institutions, all underscored by familial obligations to maintain Christian values. Chris, a 46-year-old gay Guyanese national who described Christian teachings and practices in his life as “as circle,” best illustrated this. He noted that he was required by his parents to attend church on Sundays, where he was a chorister and altar boy, as well as Sunday school, the teachings of which were reinforced at school throughout the week. Chris noted, “you started school with a prayer in the morning, every time you went to lunch you were supposed to say a prayer. Anything you need you were taught to call on God.” He also noted that  Part of that teaching was that you have to live according to the rules of the Bible. Within that rule is that, male is for female, female is for male. It should not be male for male or female for female. So, that was taught in school and then even on weekends on Sunday when you go to church… and you had Sunday school, it was reinforced there. It was constantly on your mind, and constantly, because of course, you’re being bombarded with that kind of teaching.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        91    The teaching and upholding of Christian doctrine at multiple levels of Caribbean societies through various social institutions convey to same-gender loving West Indians that they are citizens of Christian nations. Government bodies and institutions, churches and related organizations, primary and secondary schools, and family units all espouse and uphold Christian principles and practices as social structures of Christian nations. Coupled with interpretations of Christian doctrine that condemn same-gender loving behaviors and identities, these messages convey to participants that, by virtue of their sexual identities, they are less than ideal citizens who transgress the teachings of the church and state. Hostility from religious leaders. Participants spoke extensively of Christian teachings rejecting homosexuality and the ways in which their experiences with such messages conveyed their otherness and exclusion from the church. Each participant (n = 11) shared having a connection to the church during childhood, which was severed from having experienced ongoing homonegativity with their religious institutions. Participants described church leaders publicly denouncing homosexuality during church services and in the public arena, and in some cases, inciting violence against same-gender loving persons. Oleta, a 31-year-old Jamaican lesbian, described her experiences with her church as a 16-year-old girl, a period in her life when she was searching for answers regarding her faith and sexuality. She distinctly recalled one particular sermon, which communicated that she, as a same-gender loving Jamaican woman, was not welcome in the church: The pastor got up there on the pulpit and started preaching about Sodom and Gomorrah because you know Adventists love the Old Testament; they love nothing more than Old Testament. They were up there preaching about Sodom and Gomorrah. I don't know what it was that day, but the way how he preached that message just like upset my spirit. It was  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        92    almost like the way how he was preaching was invoking people in the church to go out and commit acts of violence against people who were gay or who they perceived to be gay, and that was that. After that, I did not go back to church. Aretha, a 34-year-old lesbian from Antigua, also shared her experience with attending church services with her wife and two daughters. She recalled numerous occasions when, upon entering church with her family, the pastor would conveniently change the subject of his discussion or sermon to preaching against homosexuality. Aretha noted,  He could be doing the welcome. If we walk in in the middle of the welcome, his topic change to homosexuality. And I guess he figured the more he speaks about it, the more he will make us uncomfortable and we won't come back. Despite her negative experiences, Aretha does go back for the sake of her two daughters. Each participant in this study included the church as part of their lived experiences as Caribbean nationals of Christian nations. Tellingly, however, each participant also described a severed relationship with the church as a result of religious leaders who have intentionally excluded them from the church by promoting religious teachings that reject, and in some cases, violate their identities. Their experiences conveyed the messages that Caribbean churches are unwelcoming of same-gender loving identities. It also conveys the message that an identity as a devout Christian and an identity as a practicing, self-accepting same-gender loving person are mutually exclusive. Evident in the third theme, I’m Here and Queer! same-gender loving West Indians in this study developed a spiritual identity that is in line with their beliefs and one that affirms their same-gender loving identities.  Familial expectations. As social systems collaboratively provide societal expectations of sexuality, participants’ families played an integral role in communicating both implicit and  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        93    explicit expectations of heterosexuality that they will date and marry someone of the opposite sex; a message that was conveyed as early as elementary school. The complexity of familial expectations is that it is not monolithic or stagnant, but evolved with time, evidenced by the subtheme Societal Affirmations of the I’m Here and Queer! theme. Nevertheless, familial expectations of heterosexuality played a significant role in shaping participants’ development of a personal same-gender loving identity and the intrapersonal conflict that they faced during this process. In some cases, familial expectations of heterosexuality were reflected as an overt and covert rejection of homosexuality, for which behaviors that were perceived to indicate homosexuality were corrected or punished.  For example, Oleta, a 31-year-old lesbian from Jamaica, recalled an event during her childhood when she, along with her younger brothers and his friends, were playing a game of bouncing pillows off each other. She noted, “they were playing that game, the parents just started freaking out and telling them, ‘You cannot play like that!’ It was a whole thing. You can’t play like that! Because I think they ended up laying on top of each other. She also shared another experience with witnessing her father’s treatment of her younger brother noting My brother started wearing the skinny jeans and stuff. I just remember my dad flipped out. It's a good thing we didn't grow up with our father because he's the source of all the ... my father was a phobic in every single way. He was super cool but ... he was a good person but in every way this man was just a phobe. I remember him accosting my brother and it actually got physical. He thought my brother was gay because my brother wore skinny jeans. As expressed by several participants, illustrated in the provided quotes, parental and familial expectations of heterosexuality and the rejection of homosexuality are instilled from a  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        94    young age. For same-gender loving West Indians, this conveys the message that to be same-gender loving defies familial values and will not be accepted, a message that played an integral role in participants’ decisions to withhold their sexual identity from parents and family members until adulthood or a period when they no longer relied financially on their parents and families. Social sanctions. As various sectors of Caribbean societies collaboratively reinforce heteronormative cultural values, there are also sanctions in place to uphold such values. Despite existing anti-buggary laws on each participant’s native island, participants from each island referenced their nation’s Christian Council branch of the World Council of Churches as the primary driving force behind social sanctions that aim to prohibit homosexuality. Participants expressed that heteronormative and homonegative values were also sanctioned within the public sector of societies, such as law enforcement (police), within government offices, and particularly within primary and secondary schools. Three participants from Barbados, for example, expressed that it is customary for police officers on their island to trivialize or ignore the complaints of LGBTQ persons.  Within primary and secondary academic institutions specifically, social sanctions were implemented and upheld by school administration through schools’ exclusion of same-gender loving identities across the curriculum, rules, regulations, and school culture grounded in Christian teachings that problematize same-gender loving identities within school systems. This was exemplified when Aretha, a 34-year-old lesbian mother from Antigua, was called in for a meeting with her daughter’s school board, in which she was asked to keep her lifestyle private after her daughter, who was in the 6th grade, openly shared in social studies class that she was part of a same-sex parent family. Aretha shared,  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        95    They called me in, and I said to them, ‘I keep my lifestyle separate and apart from here, and my kids are very respectful and all of that, but she's correct. She does not live in a single parent household. She doesn't live in an extended family. This is the environment that she lives in, and she's telling you what type of a family that she has.’ They actually had a board meeting because it's a Christian school, so was my lifestyle in accordance to their Christian values? No. But what could you have written to me without me filing a lawsuit against you? So, there was nothing that they could have done, except that they asked her (my daughter) not to impose her family life on other kids. Social structures, such as the family and school, intersect to collaboratively police same-gender loving identities and reinforce Christian values that reject homosexuality. In such cases, parents were called into school for meetings with school administration when students were known or perceived to be same-gender loving, monitored by school personnel to ensure that same-gender loving students were not fraternizing and, as shared by one participant, counselors were called in to deter students from engaging in homosexuality. For example, Patti, a 23-year-old bisexual woman from Antigua, recalled her experience at her all-girls high school where the school administration penalized a group of girls who were openly same-gender loving, and parents requested support from school administration in deterring their daughters from homosexuality. Patti noted My aunt went to the principal and was like, ‘I don’t want her talking to my daughter. ’So, the girl at one point, and my cousin, were not supposed to be seen speaking to each other at school. A teacher told my cousin, ‘you’re not supposed to go to her classroom. If you're passing, fine, but I don't want to see you hanging around, lingering around there. ’I know my aunt would say she was getting reports about what my cousin was doing.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        96    Participants also experienced social sanctions within the public sector of their societies, including places of employment, that aim to reinforce heterosexuality and police same-gender loving identities, facilitated by the absence of laws that protect the rights of same-gender loving persons. For instance, following her marriage, which took place in the United States, Aretha, a 34-year-old lesbian from Antigua, shared her challenges with getting her name updated on her Antigua passport on the island. Aretha shared that, at the time, the passport office refused to update and return her passport on the premise that she did not have sufficient documentation indicating the reason for her name change. Despite pleading with the passport officer, noting that she provided the necessary documents, including her marriage certificate, to indicate her name change, she remained unsuccessful on the premise that same-sex marriage is not recognized in Antigua. Furthermore, Aretha shared that someone from the passport office leaked her marriage certificate, which was circulated via social media noting, “that was the first that I’ve had it out there, when I went to change my passport. Someone was able to send me a picture of it.” Aretha also shared that she is “facing hell at work” as coworkers refuse to address her by her new married name, continue to send professional documents with her previous last name. She is facing barriers with updating her payroll records at work to reflect her last name change. She noted Even the payroll officer refused to update my information, so she still sends it with my previous last name, and the bank sends it back. I had to get crazy on them, and I said, ‘whether or not you want to accept it doesn't change the fact that you have to pay me, and in order to pay me, you need to update your system because we will have a problem.’ The existence and implementation of social sanctions that prohibit homosexuality function to obstruct the lives and expression of same-gender loving West Indians. This conveys the message  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        97    that to be same-gender loving within Caribbean societies will involve experiences with systemic barriers that aim to render them and their sexual identities invisible. Gender expression. Each participant in some way spoke of gender expression and a culturally prescribed gendered code of conduct whereby transgressions to gender norms and related forms of gender expression were frowned on, as homosexuality would be presumed. This conveyed to participants that masculinity in women and femininity in men is outside of society’s norm. Six participants shared their experiences with, at one point or another, conforming to their society’s prescribed forms of gender expression in order to avoid being targeted and to meet societal expectations.  For instance, Randy, a 27-year-old gay man from Barbados, shared his experiences with his gender expression during his adolescence. He recalled that he was called a buller (a Caribbean derogatory term for gay men) enough times in primary school that he quickly learned that his culturally deemed effeminate behaviors and extracurricular activities would not be accepted in high school, and therefore required him to change. Randy noted So, I changed a lot of things I did. I used to be in choir when I was at primary school, but I said to myself, ‘That's a little too girly, I'm going to stop doing choir. ’I joined cadets, I did karate. I did more sports rather than certain extracurricular activities that I thought would be deemed girlier or more feminine when I first went to secondary school, because I was really concerned about my reputation and how people would see me when I first went to secondary school. Brandy, a masculine-presenting 38-year-old lesbian from Barbados, also shared her experiences with being required to dress feminine in line with the rules and regulations when fulfilling work-related duties in court. Brandy shared, “so what I would have to do, for years, I  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        98    did kitten heels, like little kitten heels! But economically, I had to accept that this is what's required of me.” The complexity of a gendered code of conduct in the sexual identity development experiences of participants was evident as masculine-presenting same-gender loving men and feminine-presenting same-gender loving women were often presumed to be heterosexual.  This conveyed the message that feminine women and masculine men are not expected to be same-gender loving, which in some cases rendered them invisible as queer individuals within the LGBTQ community and the society-at-large.  Patti, a 23-year-old feminine-presenting bisexual woman from Antigua, who shared her experiences with dating a masculine-presenting woman while attending university in Jamaica, exemplified this. She noted that, in contrast to her own experiences, her then girlfriend was regularly taunted in public by people who made comments such as “bun out batty bwoy” (burn gay men) and “bun out that” (burn that) because of her masculine gender expression. Patti noted When I go to school, I hear people question other girls, particularly girls who are not straight-passing and say things like, ‘me sure she have to be a lesbian! ’but nobody has questioned me. Their initial reaction is not that I am something that they do not like. As far as society sees me, at least initially…she’s one of us. Chaka, a 23-year-old bisexual woman from Jamaica, expressed feeling out of place at an empowerment conference for LGBT women when a fellow attendee made the comment, “Why are you here? You don’t look like you’re LGBT.” Chaka’s experience suggests that even within the same-gender loving community, gender identity is policed.  As illustrated in the preceding examples, the gendered code of conduct within Caribbean societies deem masculine men and feminine women as normative. For participants as same-gender loving West Indians, this conveys that adhering to gender norms can provide some level  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        99    of privilege and physical, psychological, and financial safety of fitting in and concealing their sexual identities. Transgressions to gender norms, however, can invoke discrimination, as homosexuality is often presumed. Moreover, the complexity of a gendered code of conduct is such that culturally deemed normative gender expression has also caused same-gender loving West Indians to be marginalized and within the broader same-gender loving community.  Race and complexion. Participants expressed receiving societal messages regarding who can and cannot be same-gender loving and how privilege is ascribed to same-gender loving persons based on skin-color, skin-shade, and societal definitions of attractiveness. Based on participants’ experiences, their respective Caribbean societies have deemed it more acceptable and easier for White persons to be same-gender loving. In addition, light-skinned same-gender loving persons received more privileges than their dark-skinned same-gender loving counterparts. Kenny, a light-skinned, 27-year-old gay man from Barbados, exemplified the complexity of the intersection of race, sexual identity, and Caribbean ethnicity. Kenny compared his own experiences to his gay male friend who has endured various forms of barriers and overt forms of discrimination, whereas he has not. Among his various forms of privilege, Kenny also attributed this to the fact that he is White-passing. Kenny also shared his experiences with being mistaken for a tourist by a local jet-ski operator while on the beach with another male friend. Kenny expressed, “had I looked like a local, I would not have been asked that. And if I identified other than how I am, maybe it would have been a point of contention, which I did not create for myself.”  Randy, a dark-skinned 27-year-old gay man from Barbados, shared that his race and complexion were insecurities of his for a while and feeling like “an ugly duckling” as a teenager because “dark-skinned guys never really used to get a lot of love.” Randy further noted, “there’s  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        100    a certain level of colorism in the Caribbean, so I always felt that would be one of the deterring factors for me to maybe getting a boyfriend or something.” Similarly, Patti, a 23-year-old bisexual woman from Antigua shared that, from her observations, persons with light skin and curly hair have it easier to be same-gender loving and automatically deemed more attractive, and as a result she may not always feel as attractive as those counterparts. Patti also noted, “I’ve had people say ‘oh, well, they're White people, they're allowed to try something.’ But if it is in reference to a Black person, the response is more like ‘you’re Black! What do you mean, gay? No!’ The colorism experienced and witnessed by participants within Caribbean societies convey that Black and dark-skinned same-gender loving West Indians have been deemed less desirable and less acceptable in contrast to their White and light-skinned counterparts. Not deserving. Through experiences with personal discrimination and oppression, and witnessing the discrimination and oppression of other same-gender loving persons within their societies, participants received messages of otherness and that they are not deserving of existing within their Caribbean societies because they transgress societal rules and norms. Such experiences conveyed that to be same-gender loving is to be undeserving of occupying space within their respective islands. This was exemplified by the experiences of Aretha, a 34-year-old Antiguan lesbian. In her high ranking position in Antigua’s public sector, citizens of Antigua have written letters to her bosses requesting that she be fired on the basis of her sexual identity; has had a coworker refer to her sexual identity as a curse and nasty; and her boss has threatened to fire her based on her public sexual identity. Chaka, a 26-year-old bisexual woman from Jamaica, also shared her experience at a local Kentucky Fried Chicken with her gay male friend when, following her friend’s placement of his order, the cashier wrote on the order “somebody get this fish his sandwich,” which ended up on  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        101    the restaurant’s teleprompter. As noted by Chaka, “there are always reminders that you don’t belong in this space.” This notion was also experienced by Oleta, a 31-year-old Jamaican lesbian, who, on her way home from high school, witnessed a mob of people attacking a man, throwing stones at him because they perceived he was gay. Oleta shared, “that image stayed in my brain for the whole of my time living in Montego Bay to remind me to be careful because people are crazy and just perceiving that you are gay is enough for them to form a mob and attack you.” Participants, as same-gender loving West Indians, who experience and witness the discrimination and oppression of other same-gender loving persons, receive the message that their existence is undeserving and unwelcomed within Caribbean spaces and, in some cases, it is physically and psychologically dangerous to do so.  The theme, Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, encapsulates same-gender loving West Indians ’experiences with social institutions that collectively promote heteronormativity. Reflected in this theme are the Caribbean islands’ colonial values that are transposed into cultural norms and institutional policies which convey that to be same-gender loving in the Caribbean defies what it means to be a good citizen, child/family member, and Christian. Participants’ experiences with these messages informed the way they saw themselves in relation to others, particularly heterosexuals, how they navigated Caribbean spaces, and their experiences with self-acceptance as they developed a same-gender loving identity.  Theme 2: What People Go Say? What people go say is a colloquialism for what will people say? This theme centers on the internal conflict that each participant faced between embracing their authentic same-gender loving identities versus societal expectations; it centers participants’ significant concerns with what persons in society will say about them as same-gender loving persons and their families.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        102    Participants in this study expressed being faced with acknowledging and disclosing their same-gender loving identities, yet burdened with weighing the costs of doing so within their respective Caribbean societies. They expressed being concerned about the possible outcomes for themselves and their families. From participants’ narratives, this cost-benefit analysis manifested as intrapersonal conflict and the ways in which they expressed their same-gender loving identities. Cultural norms and expectations were made evident in the theme, Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be. This theme What People Go Say? reflects the internalization of cultural norms and expectations, as same-gender-loving West Indians develop significant concerns about what persons in society will think and say about them, given that their sexual identities defy societal norms and expectations. Included in this theme are two subthemes, Internalized Barriers to Self-Acceptance and Living Under the Radar. Each subtheme reflects the nuanced ways in which participants ’concerns about public opinion of their same-gender loving identities manifested. Whereas Internalized Barriers to Self-Acceptance reflects participants’ intrapersonal experiences and conflicts associated with societal expectations and public opinions of their sexual identities, Living Under the Radar reflects participants’ actions, inactions, and behaviors to withhold their same-gender loving identities. The two, however, are not mutually exclusive. Participants experienced significant intrapersonal conflict and cognitive dissonance as they worked to balance societal expectations and opinions, and their same-gender loving feelings, which is reflected in the subtheme, Internalized Barriers to Self-Acceptance. To accept themselves fully as same-gender loving also meant to disregard societal expectations and opinions, which posed a significant challenge as citizens of homonegative societies. In their  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        103    recounts, participants revealed the internalization of homonegative societal messages, which functioned to relieve the cognitive tension that they experienced with considerations of what people will say about their sexual identity and in meeting societal expectations. As participants navigated societal expectations and public opinion, several found it necessary at one point or another to live under their society’s proverbial homosexual radar by hiding their same-gender loving identities, evidenced in the Living Under the Radar subtheme. Participants lived under the radar in multiple ways, from choosing to not disclose their same-gender loving identities when provided the opportunity, to adjusting their gender expression so that others would not presume their same-gender loving identities. As discussed in the previous theme, Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, Caribbean societies ’binary gendered code of conduct is such that men are expected to be masculine and women are expected to be feminine and that transgressions to this code of conduct signaled homosexuality. Participants discussed utilizing this gendered code of conduct to their advantage in order to live under the radar and hide their same-gender loving identity. The complexity of this theme, What People Go Say? and related subthemes Internalized Barriers to Self-Acceptance and Living Under the Radar is that it is highly fluid and contextual. As participants developed a sense of self-acceptance, which will be discussed in the subsequent theme, I’m Here and Queer! and related subthemes, participants discussed returning to these experiences, depending on the context, such as professional settings, meeting new acquaintances, and engagement with certain family members. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of the subthemes, Internalized Barriers to Self-Acceptance and Living Under the Radar, including vignettes that illustrate participants ’experiences.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        104    Subtheme 1: Internalized barriers to self-acceptance. This subtheme reflects the negative psychological impact that participants experienced in navigating societal expectations, public opinion, and their same-gender loving feelings. They described negative feelings such as denial, guilt, and fear regarding their same-gender loving affinities, which were identified as internalized heteronormativity and internalized homophobia. This subtheme reflects participants’ experiences with internalized homophobia, which inhibits their self-acceptance, as they consider public opinions, or ‘what people go say?’ of their same-gender loving identities. Participants ’experiences with internalized barriers to self-acceptance are fluid and contextual.   Chaka, a 26-year-old bisexual woman from Jamaica, expressed feeling like people who identify as bisexual “get a lot of crap to say that; they say you’re being greedy or indecisive; there’s not a lot of spotlight placed on the B in the spectrum.” She noted feeling like it is a complicated space to be in, adding,  It’s easier for me to invest in a relationship with a man, because it's more socially acceptable. I think about my family, and everybody else, having to eventually come out to the most random people who don't even matter on a day to day level.  She described the fact that she had not disclosed her sexual identity to her family as “a double-edged sword.  She further noted that  It just feels really overwhelming, and I don't want to do it, so I just …it's almost like you have to really bury that part of yourself, because you know that it's not going to be accepted. I don't even really give myself space to explore that. Chaka described her experiences with internalized heteronormativity and internalized biphobia when she considers her family’s and public opinion of her identity. Yet, she also self- TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        105    identifies as bisexual and described herself as “an LGBTQ advocate”, regularly attending LGBTQ-related conferences, panels, focus groups, and queer parties. Chaka’s experiences illustrate the complexity of this subtheme and the fluid and contextual nature of internalized heteronormativity. Persons, such as Chaka, in one context fully embrace their same-gender loving identities, but in another context face intrapersonal conflict regarding their sexual identities, particularly when considering others’ opinions.  For Oleta, a 31-year-old Jamaican lesbian, her internal barriers to self-acceptance were most salient during her adolescence when she was closely connected to her church. Oleta shared that she received the message that gay people are possessed by an evil spirit. Oleta noted So I remember going home and looking in the mirror and looking, feeling my face. I'm like ‘I don't feel like I'm possessed by an evil spirit, I don't feel evil.’ That affected how I saw myself for a number of years. I suppressed, I tried hard to suppress the feelings. Literally, I was trying to pray my own gay away. Luther, a 36-year-old gay man from Antigua, also shared his experiences with guilt as “a good Catholic Christian” following his first same-sex sexual experience. He described his experience by noting, ‘I still felt that it was wrong. It was just like you have all these things in the back of your head saying this is wrong, you can't do this, you're going to go to hell.” Participants also shared their negative mental health outcomes in relation to internalized homophobia and the pressures of meeting societal expectations. Aretha, a 34-year-old lesbian from Antigua, shared her experiences with psychological challenges, intrapersonal conflict, and embrace of heteronormative expectations that influenced her decision to marry a man for whom she felt no romantic or sexual desire at age 27, just to appease her family and society:  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        106    I actually went to counseling for it. That's what prompted me to go see a therapist, because again, I felt like I was living to please my family or what I thought the image my family wanted of me, society, and not myself. It got really bad where I got really depressed, because I knew I was living a lie, but how do I not live the lie in this small island society? How do I drag my child through being criticized or made fun of because this is a mean world we live in? So, I knew that any decision I made would impact them, and was I willing to be that selfish? And how do I explain it to them? Because I also thought about my ex-husband’s family. They were big up in church, so I just figured I would just get backlash all around. This subtheme, Internalized Barriers to Self-Acceptance, and the illustrations herein illuminate the psychological weight that participants experience with managing expectations of heterosexuality and public opinion of their same-gender loving identities. Homonegative religious teachings, overt societal biases and discrimination of same-gender loving identities, and familial expectations of heterosexuality, all contribute to and facilitate the lack of self-acceptance that same-gender loving West Indians have experienced at one or various points during the sexual identity development.  The complexity of this dimension of participants’ sexual identity development experiences is that it is described by participants as fluid and contextual. For participants, internalized homonegativity became salient at various points and contexts in their lives, even as they simultaneously embraced their same-gender loving identities. This subtheme, and participants ’related experiences, illustrate the non-linear nature of sexual identity development of these same-gender loving West Indians.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        107     Subtheme 2: Living under the radar. This subtheme represents participants’ reported need to hide their same-gender loving identities in navigating their homonegative Caribbean societies. For participants, hiding their same-gender loving identities was a form of self-preservation from societal rejection. Participants ’secrecy regarding their same-gender loving identities was an effort to protect their psychological, and in some cases, physical safety. Living under the radar, in this context, reflects same-gender loving West Indians ’conscious and deliberate efforts to live their lives in such a way that their same-gender loving identities were undetected by others. Similar to the previous subtheme, Internalized Barriers to Self-Acceptance, participants ’experiences with Living Under the Radar is also contextual.  In relation to this subtheme, each participant spoke extensively of weighing the costs of authenticity. Participants expressed that their decisions to embrace their same-gender loving identities carried negative implications for their loved ones and their own well-being and success. This required them to consistently engage in a cost-benefit analysis of accepting and expressing their sexual identity. Luther, a 36-year-old gay man from Antigua, expressed feeling pressured to hide his sexual identity in an effort to protect his family. He stated For me it was always the idea of what you're going to do to the family name. Like, you're going to destroy our name. Nobody in our family ever came out. I mean, people in our family came out, just nobody talked about it. But in this case it’s that we're the only people with our last name living in Antigua, and so you come out or act all gay, or you're doing all this, you're giving a bad name to the family. Randy, a gay man from Barbados, shared his experience with living under the radar in his workplace to avoid confrontation that may have been detrimental to his employment. Randy shared one experience of seeking the help of his company’s Human Resources (HR) manager  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        108    while working for a brand that he considered to be very gay-friendly and catered to an LGBTQ audience. His company’s HR manager suggested to Randy, “if you're having issues with this brand, you can always switch over. I personally wouldn’t want to work with them because I can't deal with that gay stuff.” Randy described his cost-benefit analysis of confronting the HR manager on her homophobic remarks and disclosing his gay identity to her, noting, “I decided to just let it go. I think generally in most work situations, I always try to keep this level of separation, because I'm always afraid of what would happen.”  In relation to this subtheme, living under the radar, participants spoke of impression management, particularly through gender expression, which intentionally and unintentionally, worked to avoid others detecting their same-gender loving identities. For example, Chris, a 46-year-old gay man from Guyana, shared his experiences as a teenager, when he forced himself to have girlfriends in part to avoid being stigmatized and left out when he and his group of friends would attend May Day Fairs, summer fetes, and other social events. He also shared engaging in culturally prescribed masculine hobbies and interests, such as running track, fishing, and his dream career of being a pilot. Chris considered that his masculine interests might have been an effort to suppress his gay identity noting, “because being gay in Guyana, you were considered sissy or they used to call you shakins or ACDC,” which were described as feminine-presenting men. Chris further explained, “those were the ones that were targeted. They would call them names, say things about them and these kind of things. But then from being on the track team and being masculine, I never encountered that kind of thing.”  The previous anecdotes exemplified that, as participants navigated societal expectations of heterosexuality and public opinion about their sexual identities, same-gender loving West Indians, in various contexts and at various points in their lives, have deemed it necessary to  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        109    conceal their sexual identities and to ‘live under the radar.’ Integral to this subtheme is the cost-benefit analysis that persons experience. Physical, psychological, and financial safety, and that of parents and family members, are significant considerations that influence participants’ decisions to conceal their same-gender loving identities and to live under the proverbial radar. Experiences with living under the radar and hiding one’s sexual identity, similar to experiences with internalized heteronormativity, are contextual and illuminates the messiness of the public-private dichotomy in the lives of same-gender loving West Indians.  Theme 3: I’m Here and Queer! This theme reflects participants’ self-acceptance of their sexual identity, their agency in navigating homonegative Caribbean spaces, and the ways in which same-gender loving West Indians affirm their identities. This theme reflects the resiliency of same-gender loving West Indians who are not passive recipients of societal oppression. Participants ’experiences in relation to this reflect how they not only exist, but actively engage in seeking safe-spaces and resist systemic oppression on micro and macro levels. Included in this theme are three subthemes. The first subtheme, Societal Affirmations, reflects the societal affirmations, such as identity-affirming parents/family members, peers, and helping professionals that facilitate and the support participants’ self-acceptance. The second subtheme, I Am Not Alone, reflects participants’ sense of connection and community with other same-gender loving persons, both locally and globally, which functions to normalize their same-gender loving identity. The third subtheme, I’m Free to Be Me, reflects participants’ nuanced ways in which same-gender loving West Indians experienced liberation from societal heteronormative expectations and messages, including same-gender loving sexual and romantic behaviors, naming and defining their sexual identity, and a reconstruction of faith that aligns with and affirms their same-gender loving identity. In  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        110    relation to this subtheme, participants referenced their tertiary education as period when they had the freedom to explore their sexual identities. Moreover, considering participants ’academic attainment of at least a Bachelor’s degree, participants ’social capital and socioeconomic class provided them the privilege of this liberation.  This theme, I’m Here and Queer! and its related subthemes should be understood as dimensions of participants ’sexual identity development experience, not as a linear state or phase that sequentially follows the intrapersonal conflict and related behaviors presented in the theme, What People Go Say? Similar to the previous theme, this theme, I’m Here and Queer! is fluid, as participants expressed having experiences with both self-acceptance and internalized heteronormativity, depending on the context.  Subtheme 1: Societal affirmations. This subtheme reflects participants ’experiences with various people within their societies and the positive influence on their self-acceptance. Each participant who disclosed their same-gender loving identities to parents or beloved family members (n = 9) expressed the critical role that parental/familial acceptance played in validating their same-gender loving identities. For example, Luther, a 36-year-old gay man from Antigua, shared his surprise of being accepted by his family after he disclosed his sexual identity to them. He shared that, despite his mother’s initial resistance due to her religious beliefs, she was receptive to their open and honest conversations about his identity, which ultimately led to her acceptance. Luther noted the positive impact that this his familial acceptance, specifically by his brother and parents, had on his self-acceptance noting  For me, it was those two people and my brother who were the most important for me to be accepted by. And they did. Once they did that, it just made me feel more confident…  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        111    like I don't need to hide. If someone was supposed to blackmail me right now, they'd probably get shit.  Participants also expressed how acceptance from persons within their societies, such as peers, and health and mental health professionals affirmed and validated their same-gender loving identities and created safe spaces where they can be their authentic selves. For instance, Brandy, a 38-year-old lesbian from Barbados, shared her experience with being accepted by her peers. She described meeting her best friend Ken, who she met in community college from Barbados, and introduced her to a group of girls who were supportive of her identity, noting, “they loved me just for who I was - funny, odd, you know? And just nobody worried about my sexuality.”   Societal affirmations also came from health and mental health professionals who acknowledged and affirmed participants ’sexual identity. For instance, Aretha, a 34-year-old lesbian from Antigua, also shared her identity affirming experience when she had to undergo surgery earlier in the year, noting  My gynecologist is very open and accepting to my relationship. My partner came to all the appointments and he actually called her into the room. Everything he was doing, he explained the process to her. He didn't shun her or anything of that nature. He was very open and accepting. Aretha also shared her positive experiences with her counselor, who was affirming of her sexual identity, after seeking therapy for her unhappiness in a heterosexual marriage prior to her same-sex relationship and marriage to her partner. Aretha shared that her counselor communicated to her,   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        112    There's nothing wrong with you. It's normal. Who you love is who you love. You can't control that. And if you keep living to please people, I might wake up one day to hear you committed suicide because that's what can happen. Aretha referenced this experience as a significant turning point in her own self-acceptance as a same-gender loving woman. This subtheme, Societal Affirmations, as previously illustrated, reflect same-gender loving West Indians’ experiences with people and institutions within their respective Caribbean societies that affirm their same-gender loving identities. Such affirmations facilitate personal liberation and self-acceptance despite oppressive social forces. Societal affirmations include the existence of local LGBTQ advocacy organizations, parents and family members, peers, educators, and health care and mental health professionals. Subtheme 2: I am not alone. Participants discussed the positive impact of feeling a sense of connection with other same-gender loving persons, including same-gender loving persons in the media. They discussed experiences with safe-spaces or the desire to expand their connection with safe spaces, including queer social spaces and LGBTQ advocacy organizations. For example, Anita, a 38-year-old queer woman from Guyana, shared her experiences as an active member of an LGBTQ advocacy organization in Barbados, and as one of the coordinators and supporters of the Pride parade on that island noting that It was just amazing. The feeling of community, even though 3/4 of the people that was at Pride were straight, they're allies…but it was still really good being able to dance on the road and wave a rainbow flag. It's super empowering just to be able to be public and open. I really do feel like that's community. I feel like it's actually made me happier. This subtheme also reflects the positive influence that having a sense of connection with and validation from other same-gender loving persons. For each participant, this included being  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        113    part of a queer social scene. Oleta, a 31-year-old lesbian from Jamaica, shared her experiences with gay parties, culturally known as batty parties, in Jamaica. She described batty parties as safe spaces and expressed, “we would go and you would meet other queer people who were allies and recognize that you weren't alone ... there's a whole population of us out here. But when you walk past each other on the road, you might be like, ‘I don’t know you from Adam.’   Participants also spoke about seeing same-gender loving characters in the media beyond their Caribbean island, such as television and books, and its influence in communicating that they are not alone in their identities. For example, Randy, a 27-year-old gay man from Barbados shared his experiences with relating to the character, Marco, from the television show, Degrassi, which he watched regularly as a teenager. Randy described his relating to Marco and the positive impact that it had on his sexual identity development  He was this gay character who came into himself and just kind of being himself and his friends accepted it. And he had a lot of female friends, so I kind of saw a lot of parallels between myself and him, and I kind of used that as kind of like a benchmark for what I could achieve. So when I left secondary, probably days after I left secondary school, I went to one of my girlfriends and I just said ‘look, I'm gay. Tell everybody in the circle, let's get this going. I’m ready to just kind of move on’ and that just happened. This subtheme, I Am Not Alone, and the examples herein highlight the sense of connection that participants experience with other same-gender loving persons, both locally and globally, as they understand and accept themselves as same-gender loving individuals. Being part of LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, queer social scenes, and relating to same-gender loving persons and characters in the media, all work to facilitate a sense of connection and  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        114    belonging to a larger community of persons who share and affirm their same-gender loving West Indian identities. Subtheme 3: I’m free to be me. This subtheme reflects participants’ contextual cognitive liberation from homonegative societal messages and internalized homophobia in affirming their sexual identities. This included the cognitive freedom to engage in same-gender romantic and/or sexual experiences and relationships, despite societal values and condemn such acts. Most participants (n = 10) attributed this freedom in part to their social class and status, which insulated them from exposure to physical danger and afforded them the social capital to pursue safe spaces. This subtheme also reflects participants’ ownership of naming and defining their same-gender loving sexual identities, as opposed to societal projections and expectations of their same-gender loving identities. For example, Monica, a 36-year-old Antiguan lesbian, who is a politician by profession, expressed her displeasure when persons attempt to dictate the terms of activism and identity politics. She specified that she does not consider herself to be a lesbian politician, but she considers herself to be a politician who is a lesbian. Monica shared  My lesbian identity is not part of my political activism in the way that it is for an American politician sometimes. They campaign on the fact that they're a lesbian or they are gay or whatever. Like Pete Buttigieg campaigns on the fact that he's a gay man. But I don't come into my professional arena and talk about how I am a lesbian. When my position was announced, everybody and their grandmother just Googled it, and all kinds of people started contacting me about doing these sort of things as an out politician… like ugh, I'm not. I don't consider myself that.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        115    Anita, a queer 38-year-old woman from Guyana, also shared her journey with naming her sexual identity, which was influenced in part by the social stigma surrounding bisexuality. She noted, “a few years ago, when I discovered queer as a label, that really resonated; that is when I really started being comfortable identifying myself to people with the orientation queer.” She further noted, “but I might really define myself as pan at some point.” Anita’s experiences with societal biphobia and a biphobic husband, served as a catalyst for her exploration of naming her sexual identity to align with who she is. Anita felt that the label of queer not only aligned with her sexual identity, but was also endorsed by for husband, noting “I still think he has a stigma with bi. I've heard him talk shit about bi people, too. I don't know how much he means it. But me having the label queer has been easier for him.” Anita’s experiences illustrate the complexity of this subtheme, I’m Free to Be Me and the fluidity of internalized biphobic messages and personal liberation to self-identify. While Anita ultimately embraced the label of queer, she was motivated to do so in tandem with her own internalized biphobia, which was also influenced by her biphobic husband.  Participants also reported a rejection of homonegative religious teachings in favor of a reconstructed religious/spiritual identity and belief system that affirms their same-gender loving identities. This was best exemplified by Oleta, a 31-year-old Jamaican lesbian who shared that she could not continue going to church because the message was not inclusive and noted, “it just got out of hand.” She shared that one Sabbath, the pastor was basically up there saying “bun out batty man” (burn gay men/people) and “batty man fi dead” (gay men/people should die) which was her breaking-point, as she knew it was not Christ-like to incite violence against other people. Such epithets, also referenced by Patti in relation to experiences surrounding her girlfriend’s masculine gender expression, are commonplace within Caribbean societies, often leaving a  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        116    damaging impact. Oleta’s experiences with such hostility in church led her to begin exploring and researching on her own, which resulted in her self-acceptance. She shared, “I'm very anti-religion at this point that I consider myself agnostic.” She described her spiritual journey following her negative experiences with the church noting  I did the readings, reading the Bible; I did comparisons; I did the research and I just came to a place of peace where I was just like..hey accept yourself as you are. And anybody that is not willing to accept you, that's okay. That's their bad. That's not your burden to carry. You have to be prepared to let those people go.  Each participant attended tertiary education in the Caribbean region, the majority of whom (n = 10) described that period in their lives as having the freedom, to varying degrees, to explore their same-gender loving affinities. Participants explored their same-gender loving affinities during this period by engaging in same-gender sexual and romantic experiences, connecting with other queer persons through LGBTQ advocacy organizations and queer social scenes.  Several participants discussed that having the opportunity to leave their native islands to attend university in another Caribbean island created a sense of anonymity that allowed them to explore their same-gender loving identities and connect with queer people and spaces.  For example, Patti, a 23-year-old bisexual woman from Antigua who attended University of the West Indies (UWI) in Barbados, shared that university was her first exposure to guys in short shorts, known as batty riders, noting that she saw nothing like that in Antigua. She shared that attending university in Barbados was also her first exposure to LGBTQ advocacy groups, where she attended meetings and met other same-gender loving women. She considered it “a flexible space” and conditions under which she could be herself noting, “university really was just a whole new world; to be around people who were willing to experiment.” She also  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        117    described relating to other same-gender loving peers whose mindset for exploring their sexual identities was “I’ve never done it, so I'm going to do it now.”  Participants who attended tertiary education on their native island also shared that they found it easier to connect with queer people and spaces, having moved on from the primary and second school systems that strongly enforced religious teaching and cultural values that reject homosexuality. Participants referenced their ability to have progressive discussions regarding sex and sexuality, having visibly queer lecturers and LGBTQ advocacy originations on campus.   This subtheme, I’m Free to Be Me, illuminates the presence of same-gender loving West Indians within Caribbean societies and spaces, and their contextual freedom to live and express their same-gender loving identities despite systemic oppression. This subtheme also reflects the agency of same-gender loving West Indians in expressing and affirming their identities, which was facilitated in part by their social capital. Participants’ social capital to accesses tertiary education and their self-described middle and upper-middle class status provided them the opportunity and resources to pursue safe-spaces and people in order to be themselves.  Participants’ agency also included the freedom to name their same-gender loving identities; express their sexual identities through same-gender loving relationships and behaviors; reject homonegative religious teachings in favor of a reconstructed faith that affirms their identities; and determine the conditions under which their sexual identities are publicly expressed. Chapter Summary In this chapter, I presented the results of this dissertation study. I discussed the three overarching themes that I have identified from a thematic analysis: Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, What People Go Say? and I’m Here and Queer! along with their related subthemes. The first theme Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        118    Can Be, reflects the messages that participants received from various social institutions such as academic and religious institutions, the family, and employment institutions regarding their sexual identity. The second theme, What People Go Say? centers on the intrapersonal conflicts that participants faced in navigating societal expectations of sexuality and being their authentic selves. The third and final theme, I’m Here and Queer! reflects participants ’self-acceptance of their sexual identities, their sense of agency and resilience in navigating homonegative societies and spaces, and the role of affirmative social structures in facilitating participants ’positive sexual identity development experiences. In the following chapter, I will provide an in-depth discussion of this study’s findings within the context of pertinent existing literature and sexual identity development theory. I will then discuss the implications for counseling practice and close with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of this study, as well as implications for future research.

In so doing, I presented the three overarching themes and related subthemes, along with excerpts and vignettes that reflect participants’ lived experiences. In this chapter, I will summarize my findings of this study and provide an in-depth discussion in relation to existing literature. I will then discuss the implications for counseling practice, counselor education, counselor supervision, and allied helping professions. I will conclude this chapter with the strengths and limitations of this study and the implications for future research. Summary of Findings This study was designed to explore the experiences that inform the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians. Over the course of two 60- to 90- minute semi-structured interviews, participants shared their experiences as they came to recognize, understand, and accept themselves as same-gender loving West Indians within a Caribbean social context. In essence, the experiences that informed participants’ sexual identity development involved social structures coalescing to deliver cultural messages that reject and police homosexuality. Despite British emancipation, such homonegative cultural messages are rooted in strongly maintained colonial and Judeo-Christian values that are interwoven into the fabric of Anglophone Caribbean societies. Furthermore, internalized homophobia, which is a manifestation of internalized homonegative cultural messages, functions in part to protect participants’ psychological and physical safety. Lastly, despite the oppressive Caribbean societies in which they lived, participants possess and enact a sense of agency in navigating their  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        120    homonegative societies; they have found ways to create and locate safe spaces, build community, affirm their same-gender loving identities, and say, “I’m here and queer!” From a sociological perspective, academic discourse and scholarship have examined societal attitudes of queer identities from various countries across the globe, including Saudi Arabia (Naved, 2015), India (Tellis, 2015), Iran (Ganji, 2015), China (Tingting, 2015), Gambia (Nyanzi, 2015), and the Caribbean islands of Trinidad (Ghisyawan, 2016). The global human rights organization, Human Rights Watch, has also addressed discriminatory laws in the Caribbean and the impact on LGBTQ+ persons from the Eastern Caribbean islands of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Guadeloupe, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Braunschweiger, 2018). Research has also explored the intersection of same-gender loving identities and nationalities of persons from African, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and South and East Asian countries (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005). To date, however, the literature has lacked research that specifically explored sexual identity development within a Caribbean social and cultural context. The strength of this study is its ability to make clear the ways in which the Caribbean’s colonial history has influenced the lived experiences of participants as same-gender loving West Indians and inform their sexual identity development. Evidenced in the theme, Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, the findings of this study illuminate how the post-colonial Caribbean islands of Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica, and Guyana, despite having gained political independence from British colonizers, have maintained colonial cultural ideals.  Such colonial cultural ideals have been transposed into policies, laws, and cultural values, reflective of White settler beliefs about the body, sexuality, respectability, and race (Ghisyawan, 2016), and have informed the social climate in which participants develop a same-gender loving identity.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        121    Buggery and gross indecency laws, which criminalize same-gender loving sexual behaviors which are still present on the legal books of each Caribbean island represented in this study. Such laws reflect colonial ideals which hold heterosexual identity and behaviors as natural, whereas homosexual identities and behaviors are unnatural. Moreover, the findings of this study also made clear the enmeshment of homonegative Christian ideologies with politics in the Caribbean, which creates what Wahab (2012) referred to as homophobic nationalism, which is evident in the Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be theme. Homophobic nationalism, which pledges salvation to heteronormative citizens (Ghisyawan, 2016), forced participants to question the intersection of their West Indian identity, their Christian identity, and their same-gender loving identity.  The findings of this study also illuminate how transgressions of heterosexuality are more acceptable and easier for certain West Indians, particularly middle and upper class, White and light-skinned West Indians. This acceptability reflects pigmentocracy, which is the “sociocultural hierarchy based on skin-color,” (Couzens et a., 2017, p. 3) and colorism, defined as discrimination based on skin-tone/color (Smit, 2019). Skin-color stratification through pigmentocracy and colorism has its roots in the Caribbean’s colonial history with slavery and indentured servitude when privilege was ascribed to light-skinned slaves and indentured servants due to their proximity to Whiteness, much to the detriment of their dark-skinned counterparts. Reflected in the findings of this study, pegmentocracy and colorism continue to be a sociopolitical issue in many post-colonial Caribbean societies (Couzens et al., 2017; Smit, 2019). The findings of this study therefore show that sexual identity development experiences are inextricably linked to the colonial histories of participants’ native islands. Moreover, the findings of this study reflect the complex interplay between participants’ sexual identity, religion,  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        122    race/skin-color, socioeconomic status and West Indian ethnicity in the shadow of the British empire that once ruled their native islands.  Although social and academic discourse on the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians is often limited to their oppression and marginalization, this study also provides insight into the ways in which participants have thrived and experienced resilience as they simultaneously navigated internalized oppression. The following paragraphs will provide an in-depth discussion of this study’s findings, framed by D’Augelli’s (1994) six processes of sexual identity development, and will include a comparative analysis of relevant literature.   Same-Gender Loving Identity Development for West Indians: Application of D’Augelli’s Lifespan Theory  The findings of this study highlight the critical roles of culture and social context in the sexual identity development of 11 same-gender loving West Indians. Traditional notions of sexual identity development, such as Cass (1979, 1984), Saven-Williams (1988), and McCarn and Fassinger (1988), focused on same-gender loving persons overcoming a series of intrapersonal conflicts and moving in a linear nature toward a developmental end-state marked by a sense of personal coherence (D’Augelli, 1994). To varying degrees, such understandings hold that normative sexual identity is achieved at a particular point in time, typically during adolescence or early adulthood, and is sustained (D’Augelli, 1994). In contrast to traditional notions of sexual identity development and in line with the findings of the current study, D’Augelli’s (1994) lifespan theory considered sexual identity development to be fluid, non-linear, and shaped by biological and environmental factors across the lifespan. D’Augelli’s (1994) theory also held that personal coherence is as equally important as the social values, customs, and scripts that influence it. For these reasons, D’Augelli’s (1994) theory is particularly  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        123    relevant for same-gender loving West Indians whose lived experiences have been informed by the homonegative societal values and policies of their post-colonial islands. Given this study’s focus on the social and cultural context in the meaning-making of sexual identity development experiences, it is fitting for the discussion of the study’s findings to be framed in the context of D’Augelli’s (1994) lifespan theoretical framework. Moreover, D’Augelli’s (1994) multidimensional examination of persons’ same-gender loving feelings, parental and familial factors, connections with peer groups, and societal norms and expectations in relation to sexual identity (D’Augelli, 1994), all complement and cuts across the findings of this study.  Incorporating Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) conceptual framework of five ecological (or environmental) systems, into my analysis allows me to situate participants’ lived experiences and cultural messages within their broader Caribbean societies, which I will incorporate into this discussion of findings. The microsystem, according Bronfenbrenner (1979), is the most immediate and smallest environment within participants’ lives. This ecological system includes participants’ parents and family members, religious institutions and leaders, schools, and peers. Bronfenbrenner (1979) describes the mesosystem as the interaction between two or more microsystems. For instance, interactions within the mesosystem in participants’ Caribbean societies include parental/familial relationships with participants’ school systems and interactions between religious institutions and schools. As described by Bronfenbrenner (1979), the exosystem reflects links between social institutions that do not directly involve participants but impacts their lives nonetheless. For instance, parents’ professional positions and opportunities, have had an influence on the academic and cultural opportunities that were available to participants. According to Bronfenbrenner (1979), the macrosystem reflects the  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        124    cultural and societal values, laws, and policies of participants’ Caribbean societies. Lastly, Bronfenbrenner (1979) represents how time influences participants’ lived experiences. This discussion will be guided by D’Augelli’s (1994) six identity processes: 1) Exiting Homosexuality; 2) Developing a Personal Same-Gender Loving Identity; 3) Developing a Same-Gender Loving Social Identity; 4) Becoming a Same-Gender Loving Offspring; 5) Developing a Same-Gender Loving Intimacy Status; and 6) Entering a Same-Gender Loving Community. Each of D’Augelli’s (1994) identity development processes cut across the themes identified in this study, Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, What People Go Say? and I’m Here and Queer! and will be discussed accordingly. Note that the term same-gender will replace D’Augelli’s use of the terms (1994) lesbian, gay, and bisexual to reflect participants’ identities and for consistency of language throughout this document.  Exiting Heterosexuality The sexual identity process, exiting heterosexuality, according to D’Augelli (1994), involves individuals’ personal and social acknowledgement that their sexual orientation is not heterosexual. This generally involves gaining a deeper understanding of one’s attractions, labeling them, and disclosing to other persons, which continues throughout life (D’Augelli, 1994). Given the strong colonial influence of heteronormativity and racial hierarchies in the Caribbean, exiting heterosexuality for same-gender loving West Indians may involve nuances that are not addressed in existing theories.   Participants exited heterosexuality under the backdrop of cultural and societal homonegativity. In the context of Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory, participants’ process of exiting heterosexuality occurred on an individual level, yet was significantly influenced by social structures in the microsystem, specifically their parents/family,  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        125    schools, churches, and communities that collaboratively reinforced homonegative cultural values. Indicative of Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) mesosystem and reflected in the theme Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, various social institutions interacted within participants’ mesosystem to reinforce homonegativity as participants exited heterosexuality.  For example, reflective of Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) mesosystem, participants’ parents collaborated with schools to police their sexuality and parents reinforced heteronormative values of the church. Moreover, religious institutions and schools (both public and private schools) reciprocally reinforced heteronormative religious ideologies to position same-gender loving identities and behaviors as deviant of Biblical teachings.  Reflective of Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) macrosystem, the strong Judeo-Christian value system of each participants’ Caribbean society significantly influenced the homonegative messages and experiences with various social structures, and the policies that sanctioned homosexuality. Participants’ Caribbean societies’ strongly held Judeo-Christian ideals and homonegative values are rooted in each island’s British colonial history, which reflect Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) chronosystem. Despite emancipation from enslavement and Great Britain’s colonial rule, participants’ native islands have strongly maintained colonial values and norms of decency and acceptability that reflect heteronormativity and homonegativity that have been transposed into laws and local policies.  As a characteristic of exiting heterosexuality, D’Augelli (1994) included social acknowledgement, labeling, and self-disclosure of one’s attractions. As a result of strong colonial values of heteronormativity and homonegativity, actual or anticipated ostracism, and minimal exposure to same-gender loving identities, the process of exiting heterosexuality for this study’s participants was not focused on social acknowledgment, labeling and self-disclosure of  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        126    their sexual attraction. Instead, participants focused mostly on the intrapersonal processes of understanding their homosexuality in a heterosexual social context while managing concerns about public opinion. Reflected in the themes, Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be and What People Go Say, each participant in this study spoke extensively of their experiences with exiting heterosexuality. As reflected in traditional theories of sexual identity development (Cass, 1979, 1984; McCarn & Fassinger, 1996; Saven-Williams, 1996; Troiden, 1988), participants to varying degrees, described the personal acknowledgement of their same-gender loving attractions during their childhood and adolescence as a period of dissonance and confusion. This dissonance and confusion are informed by their experiences with social institutions such as schools, church, and family, which coalesced to convey homonegative cultural messages, which were internalized during their formative years of psychosocial development in the Caribbean.  Reflective of the findings of UNICEF’s (2015) assessment of school climate in Jamaica, participants in the current study felt that their schools during this process did not support their same-gender loving identities, by either refusing to acknowledge that such identities exist or by overtly rejecting and punishing it. Participants, as they exited heterosexuality and reevaluated cultural expectations of heterosexuality, sought to gain insight into the nature of their same-gender loving attractions under the backdrop of heteronormative social forces that policed homosexuality, which resulted in internalized homophobia evident in the What People Go Say? theme and related subthemes. D’Auglli’s (1994) Exiting Heterosexuality process arguably parallels popular linear stage models, such as Cass’ (1979, 1984) Identity Confusion, Identity Comparison, Identity Tolerance and Identity Acceptance stages, and McCarn and Fassinger’s (1996) Awareness, Exploration, and Deepening/Commitment phases, which reflect a series of  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        127    ordered stages that lead up to a personal acknowledgement of one’s same-gender loving attractions. However, the trajectory and characteristics of the stages and processes of linear models may not precisely reflect and represent the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. A lack of same-gender loving visibility and opportunities to engage with other same-gender loving persons, were unique to participants’ experiences in the Caribbean during the stage of exiting heterosexuality. Evident in the Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, culturally, Caribbean islands have maintained strong colonial values of decency, the ideal citizen, child/family member and Christian, which normalize and uphold heterosexuality and heteronormative religious convictions. The visibility and engagement of same-gender loving persons pose a significant risk for persons in Caribbean societies, as such actions defy cultural norms and expectations. Same-gender loving West Indians’ concerns with visibility and engagement are evident in the What People Go Say? theme, which reflect participants’ concerns about public opinion of their sexual identities.   Developing a Same-Gender Loving Personal Identity Evident in the I’m Here and Queer! and What People Go Say? themes, participants spoke extensively of the complex and nuanced ways in which they developed a personal same-gender loving identity in the Caribbean. D’Augelli (1994) characterized this process as the stability in persons’ thoughts, feelings, and desires about their same-sex attractions and internally identifying as same-gender loving. Moreover, D’Augelli (1994) suggested that contact with other same-gender loving persons helped to legitimize one’s same-gender loving identity.  Reflective of each Caribbean island’s macrosystem and chronosystem (Bronfenbrenner, 1979), developing a personal same-gender loving identity defies social and cultural norms,  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        128    rooted in historical British colonial values of what is considered decent and ideal. Such values impacted participants on an individual level, evident in the Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be and What People Go Say? themes. For participants, transgressing the norm of heterosexuality, by societal standards, make them deviants, for which they face discrimination and marginalization, and in some cases physical danger. Nevertheless, as evidenced in the I’m Here and Queer! theme and related subthemes, participants possess a sense of agency in developing and affirming their same-gender loving identities. Given the homonegative societies in which participants developed a personal same-gender loving identity, the process was complex. Consistent with intersectionality theory, which holds that persons possess multiple identities that intersect to influence the ways in which they experience privilege and oppression (Crenshaw, 1991; Shields, 2008), participants’ West Indian ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion, and race/complexion all intersect with their sexuality to influence how they developed a personal same-gender loving identity. Furthermore, as suggested by D’Augelli (1994), the process of developing a personal same-gender loving identity is ongoing and fluid. As participants experienced stability in their same-gender loving thoughts, feelings, and desires as they developed a same-gender loving personal identity, the messiness and fluidity of the public-private dichotomy of their sexual identity is evident in the What People Go Say? and I’m Here and Queer! themes.  For participants in this study, developing a personal same-gender loving identity in a Caribbean social context cannot be separated from the homonegative social and cultural values and colonial history of their islands. Heteronormative social and cultural values were communicated in a variety of ways. Participants spoke extensively of their heteronormative  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        129    Caribbean societies, comprised of social structures, such as schools, church, family, public sector and employment institutions, that coalesce to promote colonial values of heterosexuality and traditional gender norms from which they were inescapable. As participants exited heterosexuality and developed personal same-gender loving identities, they received heteronormative messages that were part of their everyday lives, delivered through religious teachings that were also reflected in the school systems (both public and private). Government institutions and places of employment, as institutions of Christian nations, also functioned on Christian principles, which served as justification for the discrimination and marginalization that some participants received in the workplace and government offices.  In addition to their own personal experiences, participants also referenced witnessing physical and verbal hostility toward same-gender loving persons and persons perceived to be same-gender loving within their societies-at-large. Lastly, cultural expressions, such as dancehall and calypso music perpetuate homonegativity and served as yet another reminder that their same-gender loving identities defy cultural norms. The aforementioned social and cultural backdrop under which West Indians developed a personal same-gender loving identity communicated that defying cultural norms and expectations could pose a risk to their emotional and, in some cases, their physical safety. For their physical, emotional, and financial security, participants found it necessary to take into account other’s opinions of their same-gender loving identities, which required them contextually to conceal their sexual identity from others as they developed a personal same-gender loving identity, evidenced by the What People Go Say? theme. Participants also described the personal liberation attributed to developing a personal same-gender loving identity, their positive experiences with persons who affirmed their same- TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        130    gender loving identities, and connections with other same-gender loving persons. Although D’Augelli (1994) maintained that the process of developing a personal same-gender loving identity occurs across the lifespan, for participants, this process was particularly salient during their tertiary education years. Having moved on from conservative, public and private primary and secondary school systems, participants were able to obtain some level of privacy, if they attended university on another island, and were in close proximity to identity-affirming persons and originations. That each participant in this study had the financial means and social capital to attend university, which afforded them identity-affirming opportunities, provide implications for the role of socioeconomic status and the ability to access safe, identity-affirming experiences. This reflects the findings of existing research by Ghisyawan (2016) that found that same-gender loving women in the island of Trinidad identified the University of the West Indies campus as a safe space to express their same-gender loving identities.   The complexity of developing a same-gender loving personal identity is reflected as participants navigated oppression and marginalization with their sense of agency in affirming their same-gender loving identities. Social structures, such as religious institutions and its religious leaders, conveyed homonegative messages and in some cases, expressed hostility toward same-gender loving persons. Yet, each participant liberated themselves from homonegative religious interpretations in favor of identity affirming religious/spiritual beliefs. Thus, as participants developed a personal same-gender loving identity, religion/spirituality initially served as a hindrance in their self-acceptance, yet later served as an avenue to affirm their same-gender loving identities. Integral to developing a personal same-gender loving identity is the process of disputing and overcoming negative stereotypes associated with same-gender loving persons. Evident in the  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        131    subtheme I’m Free to Be Me of the I’m Here and Queer! theme, participants renounced sexist and homonegative religious doctrine in favor of a reconstructed faith that aligned with their belief system and affirmed their same-gender loving identities. Some participants rejected religiosity altogether in favor of spirituality, whereas others utilized interpretations of religious doctrine that affirmed their same-gender loving identities and a practice of their faith on their own personal terms, which may be conceptualized using religious/spiritual identity developmental theory. Reflective of participants’ experiences, Genia (1990, 1995) described reconstructed faith as a stage in spiritual development when persons commit to a spiritual belief that they have chosen after experiences with interpersonal wounds related to religion and spirituality. According to Genia (1995), and as reflected in the experiences of each participant, persons in this stage of faith adhered closely to their personal spiritual doctrine and were able to place any religious rules and laws into context.  Based on their study that explored the impact of religious faith and internalized homonegativity on the resiliency of Black same-gender loving persons in the United States, Walker and Longmire-Avital (2013) reported that religious faith contributed significantly to participants’ resiliency when they experienced homonegativity often present within the African American community. Unlike the Black same-gender loving persons in the United States, such as the participants in Walker and Longmire-Avital’s (2013) study, same-gender loving West Indians in this study lacked access to inclusive, identity-affirming churches and religious leaders, which played a significant role in their abandonment of their religious faith and internalized homophobia.  The process of developing a same-gender personal identity was also influenced by colorism and pigmentocracy, which continues to be a socio-psychological issue in Caribbean  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        132    culture and societies (Smit. 2019; Couzens, 2017). Participants from each island represented in this study expressed experiences and feelings that it is easier, more acceptable, and desirable to be White or light-skinned and same-gender loving than Black or dark-skinned and same-gender loving. As participants experienced stability in their same-gender loving attractions and developed their same-gender loving personal identity, their race and complexion influenced how persons within their societies treated them and how they saw themselves. Dark-skinned participants also reported feeling less attractive, less desirable, and less accepted than their light-skinned counterparts. The findings of the current study, which reflect the experiences of same-gender loving persons from Antigua, Barbados, Guyana, and Jamaica, also reflect the findings of Couzens and colleagues (2017) study that explored perceptions and experiences of homophobia in St. Lucia. It is also interesting that the findings of the current study supported those of a study by Rosario and colleagues (2004) who conducted a study with a sample from the United States. Their findings indicated that same gender-loving African American youth reported less comfort with self-disclosure of their sexual identity and engaged in fewer queer social activities than their White counterparts engaged.  As noted by Couzens and colleagues (2017), within Black-Caribbean and Black-American communities, homosexuality fell outside of the racialized understanding of what is considered normal and acceptable behaviors for persons who are Black. Homosexuality is often viewed as something that is reserved for White persons and western culture (Couzens et al., 2017; Phillip & Williams, 2013), a sentiment that was also clearly articulated that participants in this study. Black cultural expressions, such as dancehall music and rap music reinforce this  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        133    philosophy in their lyrics and also reinforce the Caribbean socio-cultural challenges with homophobia and colorism (Couzens et al., 2017; West & Cowell, 2015).  Szymanski and Gupta (2009) examined the multiple oppressions, self-esteem, and psychological distress of Black-American, same-gender loving persons. The findings suggested that Black-Americans internalized their negative experiences with homophobia and racism, which led to negative psychological experiences, including depression (Szymanski & Gupta, 2009). Similar to the same-gender loving West Indians in this study, Szymanski and Gupta’s (2009) findings reflected how skin-color oriented oppression combined with homophobia to negatively influence self-esteem and psychological wellness.  Developing a Same-Gender Loving Social Identity D’Augelli (1994) described the process of Developing a Same-Gender Loving Social Identity as the lifelong process of creating a large and varied network of people who are aware of, affirm, and support one’s same-gender loving identity. D’Augelli (1994) stressed the importance of a supportive network of people that continuously and actively acknowledged one’s same-gender loving identity, noting that tolerance is not merely sufficient, as it perpetuates the invisibility of one’s identity. Moreover, D’Augelli (1994) noted the unpredictability of knowing other’s reactions to one’s same-gender loving identity and that reactions may change over time and are not uniform. Given the Caribbean’s strong heteronormative social and cultural values, reflected in participants’ macrosystem and microsystems (Brofenbrenner, 1979), developing a same-gender loving social identity was neither a linear or fixed process. For participants in this study, and as noted by D’Augelli (1994), creating a social identity as a same-gender loving person was a nuanced process. Creating a same-gender loving social identity would require a person to disclose their sexual identity. Decisions to self-disclose and  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        134    the development of a ‘social identity’ was highly fluid and contextual given the internalized homonegative attitudes, sanctions placed on homosexuality, and cultural values of loved ones. From participants’ accounts, same-gender loving West Indians in the Caribbean, in contrast to many North American and European countries, do not operate on a culture on self-disclosure or being out.  Given the stringent homonegative value system under which the Caribbean islands operate, participants described significant caution with self-disclosure and mistrust of persons who are not same-gender loving. Being out, particularly in the context of developing a same-gender loving social identity, involves a level of risk of facing discrimination and marginalization. For example, participants who developed a personal same-gender loving identity status have shared their experiences with being part of the queer social scene and have disclosed their same-gender loving identities to select family members. However, they still choose to ‘live under the radar’ when placed in a new context, such as a family gathering or a new professional environment where enacting a same-gender loving social identity may be deemed emotionally and physically unsafe.  As same-gender loving West Indians in this study developed a same-gender loving social identity, they formed connections with other same-gender loving persons through LGBTQ organizations. They also developed a sense of connection with queer characters in the media, began disclosing their sexual identity to trusted individuals, and joined their islands’ queer social scenes, such as clubs and secretly held gay parties, evidenced by the I’m Here and Queer! theme. Although gay parties were integral to several participants’ development of a same-gender loving social identity, it was also reported that, culturally, it was customary for persons who knew each other from the secretly held gay parties to not acknowledge each other publicly  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        135    outside of that context to maintain a level of privacy. Given the homonegative societies in which they lived, a lack of privacy or being revealed as same-gender loving placed them at risk of facing discrimination, marginalization, and even physical danger within their societies.   Evident in the subthemes Societal Affirmations and I Am Not Alone of the I’m Here and Queer! theme, participants in this study engaged in the process of creating a same-gender loving social identity status by identifying various heterosexual and non-heterosexual persons in their lives with whom they felt safe to disclose their sexual identities. Generally, this included peers, select family members, including parents, and in some cases, health care and mental health professionals.   Linear models of sexual identity development, particularly, Cass’s (1979, 1984), suggested that individuals’ private and personal identities begin to converge as they progressed in their identity development (Gervacio, 2015). This presents an unrealistic and somewhat simplistic expectation of same-gender loving West Indians given the Caribbean’s pervasive systemic homonegativity and the intersection of marginalized identities of same-gender loving West Indians. Analogous to the experiences of participants in this study, McCarn and Fassinger (1996) in their theory of identity development disputed that such an expectation inadvertently placed responsibility on the same-gender loving persons to disclose their sexual identity within an oppressive and hostile society which rejects their identity.  Entering a Same-Gender Loving Community D’Augelli’s (1994) theory of sexual identity development centered LGBTQ advocacy as a central feature of entering a same-gender loving community. For participants in this study, LGBTQ advocacy was empowering, liberating, and a means of affirming their same-gender loving identities. Eight out of 11 participants spoke extensively of their experiences with local  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        136    and regional organizations and advocating for the legal rights of LGBTQ West Indians in an effort to confront the systemic barriers that are faced by the community. These experiences for many participants were particularly salient during university, which also served as a means to affirm their same-gender loving identities in safe and empowering spaces. Even though each participant had the means to attend university, which also provided them the opportunity to be part of and cultivate same-gender loving communities and safe-spaces, the current study does not reflect the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians who did not attend tertiary education institutions. However, the experiences of same-gender loving persons who did not attend tertiary education institutions or have not had an opportunity to live outside of their native islands remains an important consideration for future research. The process of entering a same-gender loving community parallels McCarn and Fassigner’s (1996) group membership identity development process in which same-gender loving persons progressed through four stages, beginning with a lack of awareness of a same-gender loving community to finally internalizing an identity as members of a minority group. As noted by D’Augelli (1994), for some same-gender loving persons, it was unsafe or risky to engage publicly in political action. However, a sense of community also involves an awareness of the systemic barriers that same-gender loving persons face as a community, which participants in this study discussed in depth.   Most participants in this study were active members of an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization and each participant considered themselves part of the larger LGBTQ+ community, connected in part by systemic oppression that members of this community face. As reflected in Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) chronosystem, although Caribbean societies and social structures have been described as historically and currently homonegative, they are not monolithic or stagnant,  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        137    but change over time. Participants spoke of relatively new LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations of J-FLAG, EQUALS, and SASOD on the islands of Jamaica, Barbados, and Guyana, respectively, with Barbados having its first LGBTQ+ Pride parade in 2018, which multiple participants attended. Another participant from Antigua spoke of her role as a politician who attended numerous regional and global conferences on advancing LGBTQ+ rights in the Caribbean region, which reflects a positive shift in LGBTQ advocacy efforts within the Caribbean.  Becoming a Same-Gender Loving Offspring D’Augelli (1994) described the complexities involved in becoming a same-gender loving offspring, noting the disruption to parental relationships, albeit temporarily, that often occurs with disclosure of one’s sexual identity in White American, middle-class cultures. Moreover, parents, siblings, and extended family members all adapt differently due to negative societal images and stigma associated with same-gender loving identities. In the context of Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory, participants’ parents are positioned within the microsystem, the most immediate environment in their lives.  As participants experienced various sexual identity processes, parents and family members inevitably played an integral role in their lives. Parental and familial cultural values reflected the heteronormative societies in which participants lived, strongly influenced by heteronormative religious and colonial values. Parental and familial cultural values later reflected an evolved same-gender loving identity-affirming value system. In relation to Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory, parental homonegative attitudes toward participants’ same-gender loving identities illustrate how societal values within the macrosystem, rooted in their islands’ colonial history within the chronosystem, are conveyed within their microsystems, specifically the family unit. Moreover, the eventual parental acceptance described by participants  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        138    reflect the influence of time and evolving nature of social institutions and people, as illustrated by Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) chronosystem. Parents served as both a hindrance to participants’ self-acceptance by perpetuating heteronormative and homonegative ideals, and a catalyst to participants’ self-acceptance when parents affirmed their identities. Thus, becoming a same-gender loving offspring is nuanced and reflected that social structures and societies are neither monolithic or static.  Evident in the Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be theme, each participant in this study spoke of parental/familial expectations of heterosexuality to varying degrees. Some participants shared instances of being punished or corrected on behaviors that were considered to presume homosexuality by parents. Eight out of 11 participants reported having disclosed their same-gender loving identities to their parents and shared their challenges with this process. Evident in the What People Go Say? theme and related subthemes, participants described the cost-benefit analysis involved with disclosing their sexual identities to their parents and family members. Participants expressed significant concerns that their identity as a same-gender loving offspring would unintentionally impose unto their loved ones the stigmatizing identity of being parents or family members of a same-gender loving person, referred to as courtesy stigma (White et al., 2016). Characteristic of same-gender loving persons from collectivistic cultures, such as Islamic communities (Siraj, 2012), participants’ concerns, albeit initially, extended beyond their individual need to publicly disclose their sexual identity and reported having significant intrapersonal conflict and guilt associated tarnishing their family’s reputation. As a result, despite having disclosed their sexual identity to carefully selected family acquaintances, participants elected to disclose their sexuality to parents and family members  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        139    specifically once they gained a sense of independence, particularly financially, from their families. The findings of the current study reflect that of White et al. (2016), which showed that among same-gender loving Jamaican men, disclosure to parents was highest among persons who had strong familial relationships, higher levels of education, and financial freedom. Reflected in the Societal Affirmations subtheme of the I’m Here and Queer! theme, participants who disclosed their sexual identity to parents described parental acceptance of their same-gender loving identity. Participants in some cases described open and honest dialogues with parents about their sexual identities, which aided in dispelling myths and negative stereotypes regarding the same-gender loving identities. For the same-gender loving West Indians in this study, parental affirmation of participants’ sexual identities facilitated their self-acceptance, agency, and in several cases, a willingness to live openly as a same-gender loving person on their island. Shilo and Savaya (2011) also found that familial acceptance and support had the greatest impact on Israeli participants’ self-acceptance of their sexual identity, which further illuminates the critical role of identity-affirming parents/family in the lives and psychological well-being of same-gender loving persons.   The findings of the current study suggest that for same-gender loving West Indians in this study, becoming a same-gender loving offspring is a complex process. Parents/family are one of the social structures that communicated that it is unacceptable to be same-gender loving, and that heterosexuality is expected. Participants’ internalization of parental/familial heteronormative values and messages, which reflect the heteronormative, Christian societies in which they lived, manifested in their internalized barriers to self-acceptance, which led to participants conceal their sexual identities. Yet, familial acceptance and support were significant to their personal  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        140    liberation of self-acceptance.  Out of 11 participants, eight reportedly self-disclosed to their parents, all of whom shared experiences with eventually gaining full acceptance of their parents. Two out of the three participants who had not disclosed to their parents described an unspoken knowledge that their parents had and that parents treated them with love and respect regardless of this. Although the findings of the current study provide insight into same-gender loving West Indians’ relationships with family members in the context of their sexual identities, these findings also reflect the experiences of middle class and upper middle-class West Indian parents and families, who are also highly educated. This presents implications for the experiences of parents and families of lower socioeconomic status, who may have less access to education and information on liberal perspectives of same-gender loving identities and the importance of identity-affirming parental and familial support.  Developing a Same-Gender Loving Intimacy Status Same-gender loving intimacy within the context of Caribbean cultural norms reflected within participants’ macrosystem (Bronfenbrenner, 1979), transgress societal definitions of decency and normalcy. Caribbean cultural norms that deem same-gender loving behaviors as immoral and unnatural are rooted in colonial value systems that have been transposed into laws, policies, and cultural norms (Ghisyawan, 2016), embedded in participants’ macrosystem as a result of their islands colonial history reflected in the chronosystem (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Thus, West Indians who enter a same-gender loving intimacy status do so at the risk of facing oppression and marginalization within their respective societies, which informed participants’ decisions to maintain their privacy and conceal same-gender loving intimate relationships, evident in the Living Under the Radar subtheme of the What People Go Say? theme.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        141    D’Augelli’s (1994) view on developing a same-gender loving intimacy status centered on the lack of societal visibility of same-gender loving couples, the dominance of heterosexist views on the nature of intimate relationships, and negative stereotypes surrounding same-gender relationships. For example, the belief that gay men are excessively sexual, promiscuous, and do not maintain meaningful relationships (Simon, 1998; Zivony & Lobel, 2014) is a common stereotype that some participants shared. Two male participants, for instance, expressed their willingness to disclose their same-gender loving identities to their parents once they entered loving, committed relationships to disprove negative stereotypes about gay male sexuality and increase their likelihood of familial acceptance. In describing her reactions to her initial same-gender loving feelings, a female participant described her pervasive belief in the stereotype that if she committed to being a lesbian, she would also be committing to a life of solitude and no sex. Evident in the I’m Here and Queer! theme, each participant in this study spoke of entering a same-gender loving intimacy status as a way of affirming sexual identity, despite social values and laws that reject same-gender loving behaviors. Participants shared experiences of same-gender loving intimacy that ranged from their first kiss with someone of the same-gender to marriage. D’Augelli (1994) argued that as a result of negative stereotypes surrounding same-gender intimate relationships, same-gender loving persons often created personal and couple-specific norms. However, given the rise in visibility of same-gender relationships since D’Augelli’s (1994) discussion of this process, it is worth knowing the intricacies of navigating same-gender loving intimate relationships in the Caribbean, which was beyond the scope of this study.    TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        142    Breakdown of Themes Across D’Augelli’s (1994) Processes As illustrated in the visual representation of this study’s themes in relation to D’Augelli’s (1994) theoretical framework (see Figure 1), specific themes and related subthemes of this study were particularly salient during participants’ identity development processes. This analytic perspective foregrounds participants’ experiences that are reflected within each theme and subtheme, and allows for a clearer view of similarities across identity development processes, and highlights important nuances within each theme in relation to D’Augelli’s (1994) identity processes.   Figure 1. Visual Representation of Themes.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        143    Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be The theme, Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, was particularly salient as participants exited heterosexuality and as they were becoming same-gender loving offspring. In both processes, participants’ parents/families, as a social institution of the post-colonial Caribbean, held significant power as they went through each of these processes. Participants’ parents/families in conjunction with other social institutions, such as schools and religious institutions, were influential in communicating and policing heteronormative expectations of who they should be, which informed their challenges with self-acceptance and concerns with courtesy stigma as they exited heterosexuality. For this reason, participants were primarily concerned with the intrapersonal process of understanding their same-gender loving identities within a heterosexual social context, and not concerned with a public acknowledgement of their same-gender loving affinities, as suggested by D’Augelli’s (1994). Parental/familial heteronormative values, as reflected in Social Structures Collaboratively Tell Me Who I Can Be, were also salient as participants became same-gender offspring. Heteronormative expectations of parents/families played a central role in participants’ lives and informed some participants’ reluctance to disclose their same-gender loving identities to parents and their reluctance to enter the identity process of becoming a same-gender offspring. For most participants, however, parents/family as a social institution, which once communicated heteronormative expectations, later accepted and affirmed their same-gender loving identities through open and honest dialogues regarding their sexual identities What People Go Say? The second theme, What People Go Say? was salient during participants’ identity processes of exiting heterosexuality, developing a personal same-gender loving identity, and  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        144    becoming a same-gender loving offspring. Participants’ concerns with public opinion regarding their sexual identities, reflected in What People Go Say? were central to three out of D’Augelli’s (1994) six identity processes. Participants’ concerns about public opinion regarding their sexual identities as they exited heterosexuality, developed a personal same-gender loving identity, and became a same-gender loving offspring were a function of situating themselves as same-gender loving West Indians within a heteronormative Caribbean social context.  Intrapersonal conflict, reflected in the subtheme, Internalized Barriers to Self-Acceptance, and intentionally withholding and masking their same-gender loving identities reflected in the subtheme, What People Go Say, were particularly salient as participants faced becoming a same-gender loving offspring, which reflect the powerful impact of participants’ fear of imposing a courtesy stigma onto parents and family members.  I’m Here and Queer! Participants’ experiences with self-acceptance, personal liberation, and agency in affirming their same-gender loving identities, captured by the third theme I’m Here and Queer! was particularly salient as participants developed a personal same-gender loving identity, developed a social same-gender loving identity, entered a same-gender loving community, became a same-gender loving offspring, and developed a same-gender loving intimacy status. Thus, the I’m Here and Queer! theme cuts across five of D’Augelli’s (1994) six identity development processes that include similarities and nuances relative to each identity process.  As participants experienced stability in their same-gender loving thoughts, feelings, and desires as they developed a same-gender loving personal identity, their sexual identities intersected with other cultural identities, particularly their religious/spiritual identities, race/complexion, and socioeconomic status. Participants liberated themselves from colonial  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        145    values by challenging and rejecting societal values that do not accept their same-gender loving identities in favor of value systems that affirm their same-gender living identities. Participants’ personal liberation from homonegative value systems was particularly evident in their identity-affirming reconstructed faith.  As participants affirmed their same-gender loving identities, their experiences with others and their views of themselves were informed by the colonial-rooted racial hierarchy, which privileged White and light-skinned persons within their respective Caribbean societies. Participants’ agency in affirming their same-gender loving identities within this theme was facilitated by their middle class and upper middle-class socioeconomic status, which provided them the means to safely pursue identity-affirming people and safe-spaces as they developed a personal same-gender loving identity.  Despite the strong heteronormative colonial value systems present in participants’ respective Caribbean societies, they sought and identified trusted individuals with whom they could disclose their sexual identity. Captured in the Societal Affirmations and I Am Not Alone subthemes of the I’m Here and Queer theme, such trusted individuals, both heterosexual and same-gender loving, would serve to affirm participants’ same-gender loving identities and facilitate a social or public acknowledgment of their same-gender loving identities. Participants described their experiences of developing a same-gender loving social identity as fluid and contextual such that the public-private dichotomy of their sexual identities was dependent on context and would change depending on circumstances, such as physical, psychological, and financial safety. Reflected in the theme I’m Here and Queer and subtheme Societal Affirmations, parents/family were a uniquely influential in facilitating participants’ personal  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        146    liberation from homonegative societal values and self-acceptance as they became same-gender loving offspring. While parental/familial heteronormative influences initially served as a hindrance to participants’ self-acceptance, parental/familial evolved, identity-affirming stances supported participants’ personal liberation from internalized homonegativity. For participants in this study, advocacy served as a means to enter and build a same-gender loving community, and a way to say ‘I’m here and queer!’ Although advocacy served as a way for participants to affirm their same-gender loving identities, participants also noted the need on occasions to advocate privately, as opposed to publicly. Such decisions were due to concerns with physical, psychological, and emotional safety as a result of living in strongly homonegative Caribbean societies sans specific laws that protect their human rights and freedoms as same-gender loving persons.  Participants spoke of entering physically and emotionally intimate same-gender loving relationships as a way to affirm their same-gender loving identities, as a way to enact their personal liberation from homonegative societal values, and exercise the freedom to embrace their same-gender loving attractions, captured in the subtheme, I’m Free to Be Me. Similar to the processes of developing a same-gender loving social identity and entering a same-gender loving community, participants felt the need in some circumstances (such as the presence of unfamiliar people and social settings) to exercise discretion, specifically with publicly acknowledging their same-gender loving intimate relationships and public displays of affection. Such discretion, according to participants, serves to avoid being targeted or stigmatized within their respective communities, and to maintain their physical, emotional, and psychological safety. As explained within this discussion of the theme, I’m Here and Queer!  it is critical to underscore that participants’ experiences with this theme was contextual and fluid. Thus,  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        147    participants’ experiences with personal liberation from internalized homonegativity fluctuated depending on the circumstances. Factors such as physical, emotional, and psychological safety influenced participants’ feelings and behaviors regarding concerns of public opinion of their same-gender loving identities captured in the theme, What People Go Say? and how they chose to affirm their same-gender loving identities in the theme I’m Here and Queer! Implications This study explored the experiences that inform the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians. In so doing, this study centered Caribbean culture and social context in in the sexual identity development process.  Existing theoretical models of sexual identity development have provided useful frameworks to guide counseling and allied helping professions, yet lacked important contextual information to provide culturally responsive assistance to same-gender loving West Indians, which this study provides. Thus, the findings from this study provide several implications to inform counseling practice, counselor education, supervision, advocacy, and future research. Counseling Practice  First and foremost, the ACA Multicultural and Social Justice Counseling Competencies note that, privileged and marginalized counselors working with culturally diverse populations develop self-awareness and are able to explore their attitudes, values, and biases in working with privileged and marginalized clients (Ratts et al., 2015). Furthermore, according to the Society of Sexual Affectional Intersex, and Gender Expansive Identities (SAIGE) (formerly ALGBTIC), counselors are to acknowledge and affirm the identities as determined by their clients and understand that cultural, familial, and psychosocial factors influence the development of affectional orientations (ALGBTIC, 2013). This is particularly necessary when working with  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        148    same-gender loving West Indians. When counselors seek to understand and are mindful of the West Indian clients’ unique circumstances and their West Indian culture in relation to their presenting issues, the therapeutic alliance is likely to be strengthened (Phillip & Williams, 2013). The findings of this study illuminate the fact that for same-gender loving West Indian participants, the experiences that inform their sexual identity development are inextricably linked to the colonial histories that reflect the heteronormative value systems of their Caribbean societies. It is therefore imperative that practicing counselors are knowledgeable of the socio-historical, political, and cultural backgrounds of clients’ native Caribbean islands. Counselors are encouraged to research this information as necessary throughout the counseling process and be prepared to explore with clients how internalized homonegativity is linked to the post-colonial value system of their native island.  Counselors should attend to clients’ experiences with various social institutions, such as parents/family, schools, and religious institutions, and their influence on clients’ internalized homonegativity and self-acceptance. While participants shared experiences with social structures coalescing to convey homonegative messages, participants also shared positive experiences with parents/family, and tertiary education institutions as affirming to their same-gender loving identities. Attention to clients’ experiences with social institutions may be helpful with identifying and connecting clients to identity-affirming persons and institutions. Moreover, this provides a unique opportunity for counselors to reiterate that the counseling setting and relationship serve as a safe and identity-affirming space for their same-gender loving West Indian clients.   Participants in this study spoke extensively of the ways in which homonegative cultural messages, rooted in homonegative interpretations of Christian doctrine and British colonial  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        149    values are engrained into their psyche from an early age. They also shared the ways in which such messages manifested as internalized homophobia. It is therefore necessary that, with intention, counselors working with same-gender loving West Indians gain insight into clients’ internalized cultural messages about homosexuality and how these messages influence their worldview and beliefs about their same-gender loving identities. This study’s findings highlighted the complex ways that participants’ West Indian ethnicity intersected with their other cultural identities, such as their sexual identity, race/complexion, religion, and socioeconomic status, which influenced their experiences and how they developed their sexual identities.  Counselors working with same-gender loving West Indians must assess same-gender clients’ multiple and intersecting identities and seek with empathy to understand that the intersectionality has influenced their experiences, values, and beliefs. Specifically, counselors should explore same-gender loving West Indian clients’ past and current access to identity-affirming safe-spaces and people, which may be influenced by clients’ socioeconomic status and social capital. Relatedly, counselors should explore clients’ parental/familial relationships and acceptance in relation to their same-gender loving sexual identity, and their influence on clients’ self-acceptance.  Participants spoke extensively of concerns surrounding public opinion of their same-gender loving identities, and the negative impact that their same-gender loving identities could have on their parents and family members.  Counselors should be prepared to attend to potential concerns regarding courtesy stigma, which may be influential in how clients choose to publicly acknowledge their same-gender loving identities. Moreover, counselors are cautioned to not convey expectations of a public same-gender loving identity or pathologize clients’ reluctance or unwillingness to disclose their same-gender loving identities. Instead, counselors should explore  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        150    with clients the ways in which they wish to enact their same-gender loving identities and any nuances in the public-private dichotomy of clients’ sexual identities.  Each participant in this study shared their experiences with being connected in some way to the church as part of their West Indian upbringing, yet reported a disconnection of varying degrees, due to Caribbean church’s exclusion of same-gender loving West Indians, homonegative and sexist messages, and hostility perpetuated by religious leaders. This resulted in a reconstructed faith that affirmed their sexual identity, which for some participants, involved a loss of religious identity altogether. Counselors working with same-gender loving West Indians ought to assess clients’ religious/spiritual identity (just as any other cultural identity) and the influence of religious faith and internalized homophobia in their lives (Walker & Longmire-Avital, 2012). Counselors must also work with clients to identify their goals in relation to their religion and spirituality and as necessary, assist clients with integrating their religious and spiritual identities (Beagan & Hattie, 2015; Wood & Conley, 2014). Counselors should also reference the counseling competencies of the Association for Spiritual, Ethical, and Religious Values in Counseling (ASERVIC, 2009), which provides counselors with guidance on addressing issues related to religion and spirituality in counseling.  In relation to the development of sexual identity, the findings of this study in their totality highlight that this process is highly contextual and nuanced, and highly influenced by culture and social context. The experiences that participants shared indicate that sexual identity does not occur in a linear process and that experiences with major sexual identity development characteristics, such as self-disclosure, sexual behaviors, and queer social connections, are highly contextual and fluid. Counselors who utilize linear models of sexual identity development to conceptualize the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians must be  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        151    mindful that the sexual identity developmental trajectory of persons from this cultural group may not precisely reflect existing models. Thus, counselors are cautioned to not pathologize any identified variance, but instead, attend to the social and cultural factors that may explain such variances. Counselors are encouraged to take a multidimensional approach to gaining insight into the experiences that influenced their same-gender loving identities in order to understand clients’ worldview and psychological history.  Participants in this study spoke extensively of their homonegative experiences within the primary and school systems, and the consequential internalization of such messages. These findings highlight the psychological danger in a non-affirming school environment. Thus, school counselors are implored to take an affirmative approach in working with same-gender loving students (Goodrich et al., 2013; Ratts et al., 2013; Singh & Harper, 2013) in the Caribbean region and globally. School counselors are encouraged to identify themselves as allies of the same-gender loving students within their school communities. School counselors may communicate this verbally and by including visual representations in their work/office spaces. Visual representations may include rainbow flags, Human Rights Campaign equal signs, and affirmative books and other forms of literature (such as pamphlets for community-based resources) on same-gender loving identities. As noted by Gervacio (2015), colleges and universities in the United States are becoming more diverse. This diversity may include same-gender loving West Indians. As persons within the higher education professions strive to meet the needs of their students, it is imperative that student affairs personnel be mindful that students’ intersecting identities often occur simultaneously, which influences their experiences at university (Gervacio, 2015). The findings of this study may provide important cultural information in working with same-gender loving  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        152    West Indian students and serve as evidence that traditional linear developmental theories should not serve as a universal yardstick for conceptualizing sexual identity development, particularly same-gender loving West Indians.  Lastly, this study’s findings highlighted the resilience and agency of same-gender loving West Indians. Through connections with other same-gender loving West Indians, political activism and identity-affirming individuals, participants in this study affirmed their same-gender identities within Caribbean societies in which their same-gender loving identities are marginalized. Counselors who work with same-gender West Indians are encouraged to adopt a strengths-based approach in their counseling practices and to support clients with identifying sources of identity-affirming people and organizations.  Counselor Education and Supervision The findings present important implications for counselor education and supervision, and by extension, counseling practice. First, the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP), which is the accrediting body for counseling programs, provides general standards for multicultural counseling competence (CACREP, 2016). As argued by Troutman and Packer-William (2014), and supported by the findings of this study, it is imperative that counselor educators go beyond the CACREP (2016) standards to ensure that students are prepared to provide culturally responsive counseling to diverse LGBTQ+ populations and that students have a comprehensive understanding of sexual identity development. Failure to do so not only places future LGBTQ+ clients at a disadvantage, but it also marginalized the identities of students within the LGBTQ+ population (Troutman & Packer-Williams, 2014). As counselor educators prepare students to meet the needs of diverse same-gender loving populations, the findings of this study not only highlight contextual information  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        153    regarding Caribbean societies and culture, they also highlight the imperative to emphasize the role of culture and social context in the sexual identity development process. Counselor educators may use these findings to illustrate how important nuances can be overlooked if practitioners strictly adhere to commonly utilized linear developmental theoretical models. The findings of the study showed how persons’ sexual identity, ethnicity, race/complexion, socioeconomic status, religion/spirituality intersect to influence their experiences with power and oppression. Counselor educators and supervisors may also use the findings of this study to illustrate the importance of attending to clients’ intersecting identities in counseling practices. Intersectionality should be taught across the curriculum and the findings of this study may be referenced in counseling courses, including Multicultural Counseling and Development, Counseling LGBTQ+ Clients, Lifespan Developmental Counseling, and Religion and Spirituality in Counseling Practices. Counselor supervisors who supervise West Indian supervisees may also gain contextual information regarding Caribbean cultural attitudes toward same-gender loving identities. Although the findings of this study are not generalizable to all same-gender loving West Indians, the contextual information provided by this study may be beneficial in addressing queer issues in supervision, including same-gender loving supervisees’ sexual identity development and attitudes toward same-gender loving identities in counseling practices. Advocacy Beyond counselor education and supervision, the findings of this study make pellucid the need for social justice advocacy of same-gender loving West Indians within the Caribbean. The experiences shared by participants provided evidence of the dangers of an absence of laws that clearly and specifically protect the rights of same-gender loving West Indians. The findings also  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        154    illuminate the need for advocacy of same-gender loving youth, especially within the school systems. Within these systems, advocacy efforts may be spearheaded by helping professionals such as counselors, social workers, and teachers. Lastly, the findings of this study may be used to advocate that religious leaders adopt an LGBTQ-inclusive approach to their ministry.  Limitations Despite the strengths of this study, which provide important implications for the counseling field, there are limitations that must also be considered. First, each participant in this study held a minimum of a bachelor’s degree. Their ability to access higher education is reflective of their social capital and social class. Therefore, the findings of this study are limited to the experiences of persons within that socioeconomic realm. Second, the average age of participants in this study was 40. Experiences shared in these study reflect the period in time that participants referenced. This is an important consideration as societies are ever evolving and as such, the experiences of persons from an earlier or later generation may be completely different. Third, out of the 11 participants, two currently reside in the United States. Given this study’s focus on same-gender loving West Indians’ sexual identity development experiences in Caribbean societies, the study does not explicitly address participants’ experiences as immigrants and the influence on their sexual identity development. Fourth, although the findings of this study provide insight into the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, the findings are not generalizable to all same-gender loving West Indians given the small sample size of 11 participants. Moreover, the experiences reflected within this study are only reflective of the four Caribbean nations of Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica, and Guyana, and cannot be generalized to all Caribbean nations, as each Caribbean society is unique. Each Caribbean island’s unique colonial history has influenced its demographic make-up and cultural nuances (Couzens et al., 2017;  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        155    Gopaul-McNicol, 1993). For example, St. Lucia, which has a complicated colonial history with France and Great Britain, is arguably more tolerant of same-gender loving identities due to the influence of its French colonial history (Couzens et al., 2017). This study, however, does not reflect the experiences of persons from St. Lucia.  Lastly, while in-person interviews would have been most ideal, logistically it posed a challenge given participants’ locations. All interviews, with the exception of one, were conducted via video conference. This limited the observable non-verbal behavior of participants during the interview process, which may have been valuable information during the data-collection process.  Future Research This study laid the groundwork for future research that could benefit the counseling field. Even though this study explored the general identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, the findings illuminate the need for a deeper understanding of same-gender loving West Indians’ intersecting identities on the development of their sexual identity. Participants spoke extensively about their negative experiences with religious institutions and leaders, which supports existing literature on religion and spirituality of same-gender loving persons (Beagan & Hattie, 2015; Walker & Longmire-Avital, 2013; William & Conley, 2014). However, existing literature does not specifically reflect the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. Future research should qualitatively explore how same-gender loving West Indians’ religious identity development intersects with sexual identity development.  This study also supported existing research that suggests colorism as influential in the lives of same-gender loving West Indians (Couzens et al., 2014). However, Couzens and colleagues (2014) findings only reflected the experiences of same-gender loving St. Lucians.  TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        156    Moreover, to date, no studies specifically explore the issue of colorism within the Caribbean islands and its influence on West Indians’ development of sexual identity. Utilizing a mixed-methods design, future research should explore the racial identity development of same-gender loving West Indians from a variety of Caribbean islands, including their experiences with colorism and pigmentocracy. Although this study explored the experiences of same-gender loving West Indians, two of whom have migrated to the United States, this study centers their experiences while residing in the Caribbean region. Future research may qualitatively explore the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians who have migrated to another country. Although persons of all genders were eligible for participation in this study, this study did not specifically address the experiences of persons who are transgender. Future qualitative research should explore the gender and sexual identity development experiences of transgender individuals, including those who are same-gender loving, as persons who are transgender are uniquely marginalized within Caribbean societies. Lastly, this study highlighted the positive impact of identity-affirming individuals in their lives. Future research should explore the topic of resilience of same-gender loving West Indians whose daily lives involve navigating homonegative Caribbean societies.   Chapter Summary  In this chapter, I provided a summary of the findings of this study and provided an in-depth discussion of the results in relation to relevant literature and sexual identity development theories. I then provided the implications for counseling practice, counselor education and supervision, and advocacy. Thereafter, I discussed the implications for future research and closed the chapter with a discussion of the limitations of the study.   TROUBLING PARADISE                                                                                                        157     In conclusion, this study provided a rigorous, in-depth exploration of the sexual identity development experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. The findings of this study present important implication for practice of counselors, counselor educators and supervisors, and allied helping professions. The findings of this study also highlighted the areas of future research needed to provide culturally responsive and identity-affirming helping practices to same-gender loving West Indians. Lastly, this study provided a platform for same-gender loving persons from the Caribbean to share their experiences and their truth for the betterment of persons within this marginalized and under-researched population.

    "abstract": "The Caribbean holds an international reputation of culturally sanctioned homophobia, which creates implications for the lived experiences of same-gender loving West Indians. However, minimal to no empirical attention has been dedicated to the sexual identity development of members of this population. The goal of this dissertation study was therefore to examine the lived experiences that inform the sexual identity development of Anglophone West Indians. Participants who identified as West Indian and same-gender loving were recruited for this study. A general qualitative study which utilized ethnographic interviewing during two semi-structured interviews was employed. Eleven same-gender loving West Indians from four different Caribbean islands (Antigua, Barbados, Guyana, and Jamaica) participated in this study. Findings suggest that the sexual identity development of same-gender loving West Indians is complex and nuanced, and influenced by their islands’ strongly held colonial values. Participants identified that social institutions coalesce to convey powerful homonegative messages, which informed their challenges with self-acceptance and decisions to conceal their sexual identity. Participants’ self-acceptance, feelings of belonging, and sense of agency in navigating homonegative societies were engendered by experiences with individuals and institutions that affirm their same-gender loving identities. Lastly, participants’ experiences with internalized homophobia and selfdisclosure of their sexual identities are contextual, influenced by feelings of physical and psychological safety. Implications for counselor education, counseling practices and future research have been provided",
