Hodges, which guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry nationwide. Notwithstanding the American public has grown well beyond majority status in support for marriage equality and we have reached what TIME Magazine called the “transgender tipping point,” GLAAD’s recent survey results, conducted by Harris Poll, reveal that other key, yet perhaps more nuanced attitudes about LGBT people are lagging and the cause of Accelerating Acceptance in 2016 and beyond must continue.With the monumental progress achieved for marriage equality also comes a misperception that LGBT people are now fully equal in the eyes of the law. For example, half of non-LGBT Americans (50%) currently believe that “gay people have the same rights as everybody else,” GLAAD’s survey reveals. GLAAD’s findings point to a culture of complacency, wherein the non-LGBT public is under the false and potentially dangerous impression that the work for LGBT equality is done.Yet, GLAAD’s survey also reveals that slow but steady progress is being made for acceptance of LGBT people. In many of the ‘comfortability’ questions central to GLAAD’s Accelerating Acceptance survey, non-LGBT Americans report significantly less discomfort than was reported in 2014. Whereas in 2014 over 36% of non-LGBT Americans said they were “very uncomfortable” or “somewhat uncomfortable” seeing a same-sex couple holding hands, this year’s survey finds 29% of non-LGBT Americans are uncomfortable in the same scenario, a notable decline of seven percentage points. Still, these  Americans’ level of discomfort remains about the same year over year when asked about their children, once again indicating there is still much work to be done.In Accelerating Acceptance, GLAAD celebrates the progress that has been achieved in recent years and signals concern with the emerging complacency and ambivalence. Most importantly, GLAAD remains committed to its leadership role identifying, amplifying, and ultimately breaking down barriers to full LGBT acceptance.MethodologyThe 2015 and 2014 surveys were conducted online within the United States by Harris Poll on behalf of GLAAD. • The 2015 survey was fielded from October 5-7, 2015 among 2,032 adults ages 18 and older.  The non-LGBT sub-sample was 1,781.• The 2014 survey was conducted online within the United States by Harris Poll on behalf of GLAAD from November 10-12, 2014 among 2,010 adults ages 18 and older.  The non-LGBT sub-sample was 1,821. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.For complete survey methodology, including weighting variables, please contact Seth Adam, GLAAD’s Director of Communications, at seth@glaad.org.Contributing author: Daniel Berrier, Northstar Research Partners““GLAAD’s findings point to a culture of complacency, wherein the non-LGBT public is under the false and potentially dangerous impression that the work for LGBT equality is done.3Progress over the last year in acceptance of the LGBT community1There is no mistaking that the LGBT community and its allies have made immense strides, with significant gains for legal equality achieved in 2015. GLAAD’s Accelerating Acceptance survey shows non-LGBT Americans are also growing more comfortable with LGBT people, indicating increased levels of acceptance. In fact, in most situations surveyed, these Americans report less discomfort with LGBT people than was reported the previous year. Notably, the scenarios that saw the most change were also those that were the most personal, for example seeing a couple hold hands and learning a family member is LGBT. Perhaps not surprisingly, the exception to this progress was on issues involving children, such as “learning that my child had a lesson on LGBT history in their school,” where more than a third of non-LGBT Americans are still uncomfortable.Seeing a same-sex couple holding hands2014201536%29%Learning a family member is LGBT2014201532%27%Having LGBT members at your religious place of worship2014201526%22%Learning my doctor is LGBT2014201531%28%Seeing an LGBT co-worker’s wedding picture2014201527%26%Learning my child’s teacher is LGBT2014201530%29%Learning my child had a lesson on LGBT history in their school2014201537%37%% of non-LGBT Americans “very uncomfortable” or “somewhat uncomfortable” in given situations4Complacency setting in among a  large number of non- LGBT Americans2Despite measurable progress, the data also suggests a growing complacency appears to be developing about the state of the LGBT community in America. Perhaps because marriage equality was so widely covered by the media in 2015, half of all non-LGBT Americans now report that ‘gay people have the same rights as everybody else.’ This is where Detached Supporters tend to look more like Resisters than Allies. Building on GLAAD’s first Accelerating Acceptance survey, this year’s study built an acceptance scale based on responses of non-LGBT people to the LGBT community.  To better understand how support differs across society, this year’s study split non-LGBT Americans into three segments based on professed comfort across seven surveyed LGBT-themed situations: 1. Allies: Non-LGBT Americans who were either very or somewhat comfortable with all situations (51% of the sample)2. Detached Supporters: Non-LGBT Americans whose comfort level varied across situations (35% of the sample)3. Resisters: Non-LGBT Americans who were either very or somewhat uncomfortable with all situations (14% of the sample)Perception of LGBT rights and influence by non-LGBT Americans(% of non-LGBT respondents who agreed with the following statements)In the United States today, gay people have the same rights as everybody else.AlliesDetached SupportersResisters50% 23% strongly agree22% strongly agree43%61%48%Total Non-LGBT Segment22% strongly agree30% strongly agreeGay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people receive more media attention today than other minority communities.AlliesDetached SupportersResisters 69%69%42%55%Total Non-LGBT Segment 24% strongly agree10% strongly agree34% strongly agree48% strongly agreeThe gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community has more influence than other minority communities.AlliesDetached SupportersResisters34%22%47%47%Total Non-LGBT Segment 12% strongly agree6% strongly agree15% strongly agree25% strongly agreeMost politicians support policies favorable to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people.AlliesDetached SupportersResisters30%22%37%45%Total Non-LGBT Segment 8% strongly agree5% strongly agree10% strongly agree17% strongly agree5Many non-LGBT Americans are unconcerned by or unaware of LGBT issues3Beyond being denied basic legal rights at both the state and federal level – such as protection from discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations – LGBT citizens also face many serious negative social consequences, including disproportionate rates of homelessness, mental illness, and violence. Yet, a significant number of non-LGBT Americans report that many of the issues still facing the LGBT community are not serious, indicating a lack of knowledge or lack of interest in the harsh realities LGBT people face.  30% “not at all serious”Perception of LGBT problems by non-LGBT Americans(total % of non-LGBT respondents who stated that the following problems were not serious; strongest responses of disbelief highlighted)HIV and AIDS in the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender communityTotalNon-LGBT SegmentAlliesResistersDetached Supporters35%26%20%24%   6% “not at all serious”  3% “not at all serious”  5% “not at all serious”  17% “not at all serious”Acts of violence against gay  and lesbian peopleTotalNon-LGBT SegmentAlliesResistersDetached Supporters57%34%11%26%   7% “not at all serious”  2% “not at all serious”  6% “not at all serious”  30% “not at all serious”Acts of violence against transgender peopleTotalNon-LGBT SegmentAlliesResistersDetached Supporters58%36%12%27%   9% “not at all serious”  2% “not at all serious”  9% “not at all serious”  31% “not at all serious”Social acceptance of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender peopleTotalNon-LGBT SegmentAlliesResistersDetached Supporters51%51%21%36%   9% “not at all serious”  4% “not at all serious”  11% “not at all serious”  25% “not at all serious”Homeless gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender teensTotalNon-LGBT SegmentAlliesResistersDetached Supporters58%51%22%37%   10% “not at all serious”  4% “not at all serious”  10% “not at all serious”Racism within the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender communityTotalNon-LGBT SegmentAlliesResistersDetached Supporters  29% “not at all serious”60%53%33%44%   11% “not at all serious”  5% “not at all serious”  13% “not at all serious”Depression & suicide among gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender peopleTotalNon-LGBT SegmentResistersDetached Supporters52%32%13%25%   8% “not at all serious”  2% “not at all serious” 8% “not at all serious”  27% “not at all serious”Allies6Ambivalence toward other important LGBT issues4In addition to the aforementioned undercurrent of complacency regarding the state of LGBT issues, the survey data also suggests an unusually high level of ambivalence, or people who report they neither disagree nor agree with statements about the LGBT community. Roughly a third of non-LGBT Americans profess no strong opinion about important LGBT issues. Interestingly, this ambivalence appears across segments, including Allies. .w% of non-LGBT Americans who neither agreed nor disagreed with the following statementsThe gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community has more influence than other minority communities.Summary2015 was a monumental year for the LGBT community. The Supreme Court ruling that marriage equality is a matter of equal dignity under the law afforded by the United States Constitution represents the culmination of decades of hard work and advocacy. However, even as we celebrate important advances, we must be mindful of momentum slowing, of becoming prematurely complacent or ambivalent. We must continue to raise awareness of and advocate for a broader spectrum of LGBT equality and acceptance — beyond the single issue of marriage equality. The hard work of legislative change must go hand in hand with that which cannot be conducted in a courtroom: changing the hearts and minds of society.  38%46%32%28%37%36%41%32%32%39%25%22%Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people receive more media attention today than other minority communities.Most politicians support policies favorable to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people.30%37%26%14%It is best for a child to be raised by a mother and a father as opposed to two fathers or two mothers.

    "abstract": "Non-LGBT Americans are increasingly accepting of LGBT people, but many don't realize what battles remain to be fought for full equality, a new GLAAD report indicates. GLAAD's second annual Accelerating Acceptance report, based on information gathered for the organization by the Harris Poll last fall, found that respondents' comfort level with LGBT people rose since the previous year.But many participants in the survey were unaware of the challenges still facing LGBT Americans. Half of non-LGBT respondents thought LGBT people had \"the same rights as anybody else,\" as the survey put it, when actually 31 states have no law preventing a person from being fired or denied housing simply for being LGBT. The assumption that LGBT people have equal rights across the board may be due to the widespread publicity about last year's Supreme Court marriage equality ruling, GLAAD officials said.A significant minority of non-LGBT respondents -- 27 percent -- thought violence against transgender people was not a serious problem, even though at least 21 trans women, most of them women of color, were murdered in the U.S. in 2015. Also, 37 percent said homelessness among LGBT youth was not a major issue, when in reality an estimated 40 percent of homeless young people identify as LGBT. And a third of non-LGBT respondents, including some allies, said they had no strong opinion about LGBT issues.The 2015 survey was conducted online October 5-7 among 2,032 Americans age 18 and older. The non-LGBT sub-sample was 1,781. The previous survey was conducted in November 2014 and involved 2,010 American adults, 1,821 of them non-LGBT",
