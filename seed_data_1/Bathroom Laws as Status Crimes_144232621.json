Several scholars have criticized these so-called “bathroom laws” as a form of discrimination in violation of federal law.  Few scholars, though, have considered the criminal justice implications of these proposals. By analyzing dozens of proposed bathroom laws, this Article explores how many laws do more than stigmatize the trans community—they effectively criminalize it.  Some of these proposed laws would establish new categories of criminal offenses for trans individuals who use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity.  Others would transform bathroom use by trans individuals into an unlawful trespass.  The existing literature suggests that the criminal justice system is unprepared to handle this newfound responsibility. This Article concludes that, by effectively criminalizing noncriminal conduct so inextricably linked to the status of being trans, some proposed bathroom laws may violate the Eighth Amendment’s bar on cruel and unusual punishment.

They have argued that the bill is yet another attempt to   1.

See generally Privacy Protection Act, S.B. 6, 85th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. 2017).   2. This Article uses the term “trans” as shorthand for “transgender” to be more inclusive to the wide variety of gender identities that fall under the broader umbrella of the term transgender.  The term transgender itself is meant to describe a wide range of “people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from what is typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth.” Glossary of Terms—Transgender, GLAAD MEDIA REFERENCE GUIDE, http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender [https://perma.cc/37E3-ZP44] (last visited September 21, 2017).  The term transgender itself is often a “contested term that is defined differently by medical professionals, advocates, social scientists, and . . . transgender people.” Rebecca L. Stotzer, Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Personnel Interactions with Transgender People in the United States:  A Literature Review, 19 AGGRESSION & VIOLENT BEHAV. 263, 264 (2014).  The term sometimes includes other subgroups of people, including “people with intersex conditions or some disorders of sexual development, dragkings/queens, cross-dressers, genderqueers, [and] gender non-conforming people,” and it may “include people who may or may not identify themselves as transgender but may present in ways that are not consistent with their gender.” Id.  This Article also uses the gender-neutral pronouns “they,” “their,” and “theirs” to refer to trans individuals.  3. Lindell, supra note 1.   4.

With Patrick and Kolkhorst’s announcement, Texas joined a growing list of jurisdictions that have considered or enacted so-called “bathroom bills” since 2013,6 including Alabama,7 Arizona,8 Colorado,9 Florida,10 Illinois,11 Indiana,12 Kansas,13   5. Id. (noting that Chuck Smith, the CEO of LGBTQ rights group Equality Texas, called this measure “legislation to discriminate against LGBT Texans”).  LGBTQ advocates also point to the joint “Dear Colleague” letter sent out by the Obama administration’s Department of Justice and Department of Education, explaining that these sorts of measures constitute a violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. See Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students from Catherine E. Lhamon, Assistant Sec’y for Civil Rights, U.S. Dep’t of Educ. & Vanita Gupta, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney Gen. for Civil Rights, U.S. Dep’t of Justice (May 13, 2016), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf [https://perma.cc/3Q2J-L8YP].  It is also worth noting that Lieutenant Governor Patrick is no stranger to this sort of controversy, as he has a long history of taking anti-LGBTQ positions.  For instance, after reality television star Phil Robertson of A&E’s Duck Dynasty compared homosexuality to bestiality, Patrick claimed that God was speaking through Robertson. See Eric Nicholson, Lt.

G.G.36  In Gloucester, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals deferred to the Department of Education’s interpretation of Title IX on trans bathroom use.37  The Gloucester School Board’s decision to appeal the ruling was met with condemnation by civil rights groups.38  On March 6, 2017, in light of the Trump administration’s decision to rescind this Obama-era guidance letter, the Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the Fourth Circuit for further consideration—leaving for another day the fate of trans student bathroom rights under Title IX.39 It is safe to say that, in only a few short years, trans bathroom use has emerged as a divisive political issue.  Thus far, the literature on bathroom bills has focused on three major topics.  One strand of the debate has focused on whether these measures violate existing federal law.40  Another strand of research has attempted to evaluate whether bathroom bills are actually necessary to protect public safety as supporters contend.41  A final strand of research and reporting has evaluated the financial ramifications of bathroom bills.42 This Article interjects into this rapidly evolving debate to explore an undertheorized issue related to bathroom laws—their criminal justice   34.

This Article argues that some proposed measures have the potential to do more than stigmatize the trans community.  Bathroom laws could effectively criminalize the trans community.  Some of these proposed laws create new categories of criminal offenses for trans individuals who use bathrooms consistent with their gender identities.  Those proposals that do not establish new crime categories may nevertheless open the door for local police and prosecutors to classify trans bathroom use under existing criminal statutes such as criminal trespass.  In the process, they invite law enforcement officers to use the tools of the criminal justice system to enforce these measures. This criminalization of the trans community creates multiple dilemmas in the criminal justice arena.  First, bathroom laws saddle local law enforcement with the unfamiliar responsibility of identifying and policing members of the trans community.  The existing literature suggests that American police are largely untrained and poorly equipped to enforce bathroom laws.43  Few departments appear to have clearly articulated policies for identifying, booking, searching, or properly housing trans suspects—and those that do tend to be in jurisdictions without bathroom laws.44  Second, even in cases where police officers choose not to enforce bathroom laws, the mere existence of bathroom laws could create a sort of moral panic that may empower members of the public to engage in dangerous attempts at private enforcement.45 Apart from their potentially discriminatory motivations and stigmatizing effect, these measures may expose the trans community to serious physical and emotional harm as unprepared law enforcement and private citizens are thrust into the role of policing public bathroom use.  By encouraging police officers and the public to police the trans community, bathroom laws increase the probability of police misconduct and private violence directed at an already disadvantaged minority group. Finally, this Article argues that criminalizing bathroom use, whether by the creation of new statutes or the use of existing ones, effectively criminalizes the status of being trans.  By criminalizing innocent, life-sustaining conduct so inextricably linked to the status of being trans, some proposed bathroom laws may violate the Eighth Amendment’s bar on cruel and unusual punishment. In Robinson v. California,46 the Supreme Court held that while states may regulate behavior through criminal law, the Eighth Amendment prevents states from criminalizing one’s mere status.47  Six years later, in Powell v. Texas,48 the Court seemed to back away from Robinson, declining to hold that it was unconstitutional to criminalize acts linked to a particular status.49    43. See infra Part II.B.  44. See infra Part II.B.2.  45. See infra Part II.D.  46. 370 U.S. 660 (1962).  47. See infra Part III.A.  48. 392 U.S. 514 (1968).  49. Id. at 536–37. 8 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 Nonetheless, at least five of the Justices appeared sympathetic to the notion that the Constitution may impose limits on the ability of states to punish conduct rendered effectively involuntary by a defendant’s circumstances or status.50 In the years since Robinson and Powell, scholars have debated whether any conduct can be so inextricably linked to a person’s status as to make the punishment of that conduct impermissible under the Eighth Amendment.51  Regulation of bathroom use by trans individuals brings this debate to a head.  When states seek to regulate the biological and necessary bodily functions of trans individuals through bathroom laws, this Article argues, it seeks to regulate their very existence.52 This Article proceeds in three parts.  Part I discusses the emergence of the modern bathroom bill.  This Part describes the Obama administration’s executive guidance on trans students’ use of bathrooms in public schools.  It then tracks the thirteen state attorneys general that have filed suit against the federal government to overturn President Obama’s executive guidance on this issue.  Next, it surveys a number of proposed state measures that would regulate public bathroom use by trans individuals.  Part II addresses the criminal justice implications of bathroom laws.  This part demonstrates how some bathroom proposals would explicitly or implicitly criminalize bathroom use by trans individuals and how many bathroom provisions would grant largely untrained police officers the discretion to enforce these new mandates, thereby increasing the chances of physical and emotional abuse of trans individuals.  Part III then considers avenues for future legal challenges to these proposed bathroom bills, focusing specifically on the theory that some of these measures violate the Eighth Amendment’s bar on cruel and unusual punishment. I.  THE EMERGENCE OF THE BATHROOM BILL Bathroom bills are a relatively recent legislative priority.  There are few records of state legislators proposing bathroom bills before 2013.  Since then, the popularity of such measures has progressively picked up steam.  What started as a single proposal in 2013 ballooned into nine in 2015, nineteen in 2016, and many more in 2017.53  The emergence of the bathroom bill at the state level roughly coincided with a handful of cases in which trans students secured the right to use bathroom facilities consistent with their gender   50. Id.  51. See infra Part III.B.   52. At least some courts have found that states and localities may not criminalize innocent, life-sustaining conduct that is only made criminal by a person’s status.  For example, as discussed in Part III.B, in Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2006), vacated after settlement, 505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007), the Ninth Circuit found that a municipal ordinance that criminalized behaviors like sitting or sleeping in public effectively punished the status of being homeless in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Using similar logic, this Article illustrates how litigants could challenge criminal penalties imposed on bathroom use by trans individuals under the Eighth Amendment. See infra Part III.   53.

In particular, bathroom bills seemed to coincide with a landmark case in Colorado in which a six-year-old trans girl won the right to use the girls’ restroom at her public school.

One of the most egregious examples of this was the response to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.  While the ordinance prohibited discrimination on the basis of fifteen different traits, including being trans, the opposition attacked the bill’s protection of trans individuals.  The opponents, who went by the name Campaign for Houston, ran a highly transphobic ad that warned voters of how predators could use the statute to lawfully prey on women and girls in public restrooms.

G.G.70  There, G.G, a trans boy, sought to use the boys restroom at his high school.71  The local school board then passed a policy banning G.G. from using the boys restroom.72  G.G. filed suit against the school district alleging a violation of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.73  The district court dismissed G.G.’s suit and denied a preliminary injunction before the Fourth Circuit reversed.74 The Fourth Circuit ultimately deferred to the Department of Education’s interpretation of Title IX on trans bathroom use.75  The Gloucester School Board’s decision to appeal the ruling was met with condemnation by civil rights groups.76  On March 6, 2017, in light of the Trump administration’s decision to rescind this Obama-era guidance letter, the Court ultimately vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the Fourth Circuit for further consideration.77  Some may reasonably argue that the Gloucester case was more about deference to agency interpretations of the law than trans rights.  Nevertheless, the case further ignited the heated national debate over the proper regulation of trans bathroom use. Regardless of the origins of the bathroom bill, it is clear that these potentially discriminatory proposals have grown in popularity in recent years.  Between 2013 and 2016, at least twenty-four states considered laws that would restrict trans “access to multiuser restrooms, locker rooms, and other sex-segregated facilities.”78  At least nine of these recent proposals have focused specifically on limiting trans bathroom access in public schools.79    68.

This act has not appeared to stem the growing push by state legislators to regulate trans bathroom use.  In the 2017 legislative session alone, legislators in seven states—Alabama, Kansas, Minnesota, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington—have proposed bills that would restrict trans access to bathrooms.82 Limited scholarship on bathroom bills exists, and there is virtually no literature on the criminal justice implications of bathroom bills.  A handful of scholars have argued that existing laws protect the ability of trans individuals to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identities.  For example, advocates have argued for the use of existing disability law83 or employment law84 to protect trans individuals from discrimination.  Others have crafted constitutional and statutory objections to laws that deny trans individuals equal access to bathroom facilities.85 Another group of scholars and media outlets have challenged claims that trans bathroom use poses a safety risk.  Some scholars, like Robin Fretwell Wilson, have persuasively argued that trans individuals pose no safety threat when using bathroom facilities consistent with their gender identities.86    80. See supra notes 7–29 (showing the wide range of laws that exist, with some explicitly criminalizing trans bathroom use as discussed in Part II, and others giving private individuals a civil right of action to enforce limitations on trans access to bathroom facilities).  For example, legislators in Florida, Kansas, Virginia, and Wisconsin have proposed measures that would give private individuals the right to pursue private causes of action in cases where a trans person is allowed to use a bathroom facility consistent with their gender identity.

This is a problematic oversight for several reasons.  First, not only have some states acted to exclude trans individuals from using bathrooms consistent with their gender identities, but some state legislators are now proposing the criminalization of such bathroom use.95  This means that police, jails, prisons, and criminal courts could now be thrust onto the frontlines of this emerging cultural battle.  Though there is a robust literature on the consequences of criminalization, it has not adequately considered the impacts of such criminalization on the trans community.  This is an important consideration that legislators and civil rights advocates ought to consider as states begin wading into this controversial subject. Second, attempts to criminalize trans bathroom use may open up new opportunities for advocates to challenge these measures using an alternative   91.

Although not specifically discussed in the text above, it is worth mentioning a few other relevant studies.  Dylan Vade has argued for a reconceptualization of legal terminology to be more inclusive of trans people. See Dylan Vade, Expanding Gender and Expanding the Law:  Toward a Social and Legal Conceptualization of Gender That Is More Inclusive of Transgender People, 11 MICH. J. GENDER & L. 253, 311 (2005).  Others have emphasized the need for protections for trans students. See Lindsay Hart, With Inadequate Protection Under the Law, Transgender Students Fight to Access Restrooms in Public Schools Based on Their Gender Identity, 41 N. KY. L. REV. 315, 317 (2014).  Others have wondered whether the discussion of bathroom rights is simply a diversion from more serious subjects on the path to full inclusion for trans individuals. See, e.g., Lisa Mottet, Access to Gender-Appropriate Bathrooms:  A Frustrating Diversion on the Path to Transgender Equality, 4 GEO. J. GENDER & L. 739, 744–46 (2002).  95. See infra Part II. 2017] BATHROOM LAWS AS STATUS CRIMES 15 legal avenue:  the Eighth Amendment.  Such a constitutional challenge could help advocates undercut the criminal enforcement of these prohibitions on trans bathroom use.  Thus, the parts that follow make two separate contributions to the existing literature.  Part II explores the criminal justice implications of bathroom laws.  Part III then argues that the proposed state laws that criminalize trans bathroom use effectively establish status crimes in violation of the Eighth Amendment’s bar on cruel and unusual punishment. II.  BATHROOM LAWS AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM There is a long history of limiting the application of the criminal justice system to conduct worthy of punishment.  As the Supreme Court suggested in Lawrence v. Texas,96 it may be unreasonable to utilize the blunt instrument of the criminal justice system “absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects.”97  When the law designates conduct as criminal, it has real consequences for both criminal defendants and actors within the criminal justice system.  The criminalization of conduct comes with real costs—enforcement costs,98 processing costs,99 incarceration costs,100 and other collateral consequences.101   96. 539 U.S. 558 (2003).  97. Id. at 567.  As law students often learn in their first-year criminal law courses, courts have articulated limiting principles that prevent the punishment of otherwise seemingly innocent acts. See Proctor v. State, 176 P. 771, 772 (Okla. Crim. App. 1918) (preventing the State of Oklahoma from criminalizing the “keeping of a place”).  98. See, e.g., Darryl K.

See Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 364–65 (2010) (distinguishing between the direct consequences of criminal convictions, like incarceration, and the “collateral” consequences of criminal convictions, like deportation or civil action that may follow from a criminal conviction).  16 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 As discussed in Part I, the existing literature has not considered the criminal justice implications of laws excluding trans individuals from certain sex-segregated bathroom facilities.  To begin filling this gap, this Part examines legislative proposals from across the country related to trans bathroom use.  It shows how many of these bathroom bills do more than merely exclude trans individuals from sex-segregated spaces.   As this Part demonstrates, many of these proposals would effectively criminalize the trans community.  They do this in two ways—either by explicitly creating a new criminal offense for trans individuals who use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity or by effectively transforming such acts into criminal trespass.  In each case, the effect is the same.  These proposals would criminalize members of the trans community for using public restrooms.  This puts local law enforcement, prison and jail officials, and courts on the frontlines in policing trans bathroom use.  As the subparts below illustrate, these actors are largely unequipped to handle this newfound responsibility, thus exposing the trans community to an increased risk of physical and emotional harm. A.  Criminalizing the Trans Community: Bathroom Use as a Crime and as a Trespass This Part first discusses laws that treat bathroom use as a crime.  It then analyzes laws treating bathroom use as a trespass. The most direct way that proposed bathroom laws criminalize the trans community is by explicitly establishing a new criminal offense category for trans individuals who use bathrooms consistent with their gender identities.  For example, Indiana Senate Bill No. 35 would make it a Class A misdemeanor for a person who is of the “physical condition of being [one ‘biological gender’], as determined by an individual’s chromosomes and identified at birth by the individual’s anatomy” to use a public restroom facility designed for the other “biological gender.”102  This broad definition of so-called “biological gender” is even more dangerous than many proposals from other states.  For one thing, this definition draws no distinction between individuals who identify as trans, those who have begun to transition, those who have undergone sex reassignment procedures, and those who have had their birth certificate corrected.  Under this definition, all members of the trans community would be forced to use public facilities matching their sex assigned at birth or face serious criminal penalties.  Class A misdemeanors are the highest misdemeanor offense category in Indiana and can result in up to one year of incarceration and up to a $5000 fine.103   102. S. 35, 119th Gen. Assemb., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ind. 2016).  This Article uses the terminology “biological gender” because this is the language used by the Indiana bill.  This does not reflect any judgment about the correctness of this terminology.  This terminology is out of step with the preferred language recommended by those in the trans community, experts, and activists. See, e.g., Transgender Terminology, NAT’L CTR. FOR TRANSGENDER EQUALITY (Jan. 15, 2014), http://www.transequality.org/issues/resources/transgender-terminology [https://perma.cc/PC28-8YL3].  103. IND. CODE ANN. § 35-50-3-2 (West 2016). 2017] BATHROOM LAWS AS STATUS CRIMES 17 Similarly, Florida House Bill 583 states that “[a] person who knowingly and willfully enters a single-sex public facility designated for or restricted to persons of the other sex commits a misdemeanor of the second degree.”104  Under Florida law, a second-degree misdemeanor results in a “definite term of imprisonment not exceeding 60 days”105 and up to a $500 fine.106 Other states do not clearly delineate a category of criminal offense for violations of their bathroom proposals but do explicitly encourage law enforcement to engage in policing.  For example, Senate Bill 1 in Alabama states that “[e]nforcement of this act shall be authorized by any state or local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the person or entity providing rest rooms, bathrooms, or changing facilities to the public.”107 While some state legislators have proposed the creation of new criminal offense categories for trans bathroom use, most existing proposals would merely establish prohibitions on trans bathroom access without attaching any clear criminal penalty.  This has led some commentators to conclude that, if such a law were to pass, a trans person could not be arrested for using a bathroom facility consistent with their gender identity.108  Unfortunately, this conclusion is not entirely accurate.  By announcing prohibitions regarding who can lawfully access public, sex-segregated bathroom facilities, these bathroom laws open the door for police to arrest trans individuals for criminal trespass. Generally, states define criminal trespass as the unlawful or unlicensed entry or presence in a space.109  It is more difficult to charge a person with trespassing on public property.  In such cases, when property is open to the public at the time of an alleged trespass, the state has the burden of proving that a lawful order excluding the defendant from the premises [was] issued, that the order was communicated to the defendant by a person with authority to make the order, and that the defendant defied the order.110   104.

See State v. Delgado, 562 A.2d 539, 544 (Conn. App. Ct. 1989).  The court found that the requisite Connecticut statute required a showing that “(1) that the defendant, knowing that he was not privileged or licensed to do so, entered or remained in a building; and (2) that the defendant committed that act after an order to leave or not to enter had been personally communicated to him by the owner or other authorized person.” Id.

When a particular space is open to the public at the time of an alleged trespass, we often assume that a person has a license or privilege to be present without penalty.111  In such cases, it is common for the state to have a burden of showing that it communicated a lawful order excluding the defendant from the premises, which the defendant defied.112  Some states have limited the use of trespass in public spaces to cases where the prosecutor can demonstrate the “additional fact” that the defendant lacked a legal right to remain thereby protecting against capricious or arbitrary enforcement.113  The posting of signs, the announcement of regulations, or the use of fences and barricades can be sufficient to demonstrate this “additional fact.”114 The majority of bathroom law proposals would seemingly open the door for police officers to arrest some trans individuals for criminal trespass for using bathroom facilities consistent with their gender identities.  Before the consideration of modern bathroom bills, state courts had already held that it may constitute unlawful trespass for a person who identifies as a man to enter a restroom facility designated exclusively for those who identify as women.115  In such cases, courts have held that a state may permissibly exclude individuals from public spaces and use criminal trespass to enforce such exclusion where visible signs designated a bathroom facility for the   111.

Brown, 254 N.E.2d 755, 757 (N.Y. 1969) (concluding that when someone “lawfully entered the premises, a conviction could be had [for trespass] only if the prosecution established that (1) a lawful order not to remain was personally communicated to the defendant and (2) that he defied such a lawful order”).   113.

While the Court of Appeals ultimately found that the school was more than capable of dealing with this incident without the assistance of the criminal justice system, it did conclude that a “sign marked ‘Girl’s Locker Room’ was reasonably likely to give respondent notice that he was not authorized to go into the girls’ locker room, pursuant to” the North Carolina statute.119 Similarly, in Commissioner v. White,120 a case before the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, a man was found guilty at trial for criminal trespass for entering a “ladies’ room” inside the Society Hill Club in Philadelphia.121  The defendant challenged his conviction for criminal trespass, arguing that the ladies’ room was not a “separately secured or occupied portion” of a building as required under the Pennsylvania statute.122  In rejecting the defendant’s argument, the court concluded that the ladies’ room was “reserved for the exclusive use of only a subset of the total population authorized to use the larger structure.”123  Such a holding should hardly be surprising.  As one court remarked, before trans bathroom use emerged as a divisive national issue, “the application of the . . . trespass laws to sex-segregated bathrooms and showers [was] straightforward and uncontroversial.”124 Without the presence of a bathroom law on the books, trans individuals may have a reasonable argument that existing signage does not clearly communicate which bathroom they ought to use.  In such cases, it may prove challenging for a prosecutor to use existing trespass statutes to penalize a trans person for using a bathroom consistent with their gender identity.  After all, a trans person could simply argue that signage designating gender-segregated bathrooms does not clarify how the state defines each gender category. But by passing a law that explicitly clarifies which public bathroom facilities a person may lawfully enter, a prosecutor may be able to argue that the state has provided trans individuals with notice.  Judge Thomas D. Schroeder of the Middle District of North Carolina has agreed with this assessment.  After North Carolina passed a bill limiting trans individuals’ access to public bathroom facilities consistent with their gender identities, a group of civil liberties organizations, trans students, and state employees   116.

Supp. 3d 615, 629 (M.D.N.C. 2016). 20 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 brought suit against the governor and the University of North Carolina seeking to enjoin the law.125  While Judge Schroeder’s memorandum opinion, order, and preliminary injunction covered significant ground, one particular piece of his analysis is worth reproducing here.  Judge Schroeder acknowledged that limitations on access to public restroom facilities had previously been enforced through “voluntary compliance, social mores, and when necessary criminal trespassing law.”126 While neither party was able to point to a criminal trespass case involving a trans individual in North Carolina, this was likely because “individuals who dress and otherwise present themselves in accordance with their gender identity have generally been accommodated” at least on a “case-by-case basis.”127  By changing state law to explicitly bar trans individuals from accessing bathrooms consistent with their gender identities, the court concluded that the North Carolina law now means that “any person who uses a covered facility that does not align with his or her birth certificate commits a misdemeanor trespass.”128 Thus, this is not an imagined or hypothetical concern.  By passing a prohibition on trans bathroom access in public, North Carolina has opened up the trans community to criminal enforcement under existing trespass statutes.  Furthermore, nothing about the North Carolina trespass statute makes it particularly unique.  Should other states follow suit and provide limitations on trans access to public restrooms consistent with their gender identities, these states may similarly transform harmless public bathroom use by trans individuals into criminal trespass. B.  Police Enforcement Bathroom law proposals that explicitly or effectively criminalize bathroom use by trans individuals would place police officers on the frontlines of enforcing these proposed criminal prohibitions.  This Part first discusses the long and well-documented history of police officers in the United States mistreating the trans community.129  Modern evidence suggests that transphobic cultures exist in many American police departments.130  This may be, in part, because it appears that police rarely receive training in dealing with the trans community.  This Part then identifies inherent challenges to bathroom law enforcement.  Taken together, lack of training, the history of mistreatment, and evidence of a transphobic culture suggest that police enforcement of bathroom laws could increase the likelihood of misconduct directed at an already disadvantaged minority group.   125.

See id.  2017] BATHROOM LAWS AS STATUS CRIMES 21 1.  Existing Evidence on Treatment of Trans Community by American Law Enforcement The existing literature suggests that trans individuals already experience an unusually high level of contact with law enforcement, even without bathroom laws.131  At least thirteen studies since 2003 have surveyed trans individuals about their experience with law enforcement abuse outside of a custodial setting.132  These studies reveal a few important trends.  First, there is widespread agreement within the existing literature that trans individuals are reluctant to go to the police when they become victims of crimes.  For example, a 2007 report by Jessica Xavier, Julie Honnold, and Judith Bradford found that 83 percent of trans individuals victimized by sexual assault and 70 percent of those victimized by physical assault chose not to go to police.133  That report relied on a survey of 350 individuals identified through trans support groups and informal peer networks.134  This roughly mirrors other studies on this same subject.  A 2005 survey of 265 individuals primarily in Wisconsin found that only 9 percent of trans victims of sexual assault reported the crime to the police.135  A 2001 survey by A. R. Sousa of forty-four trans individuals in San Francisco, recruited through agencies serving the trans community, found that among trans individuals that had been victims of criminal acts, only 25 percent reported the incidents to police.136  A 1997 study by Emilia L. Lombardi and others of 402 trans individuals across the country found that over 41 percent of victims of harassment or violence never went to the police.137  Of course, these surveys use a wide range of sampling methodologies—some more sophisticated than others.  Some of these studies are also geographically limited, meaning that it is difficult to reach any generalizable conclusions from their results alone.  But, taken together, the existing body of work suggests that trans individuals are likely more reluctant than their cisgender counterparts to turn to the criminal justice system when they have been victims of crimes.   131. A literature review by Rebecca L. Stotzer in 2014 provides an excellent summary of many of the existing studies. See Stotzer, supra note 2, at 272.  132. Id. at 271 (showing a list of all thirteen studies and their respective findings).  Sampling strategies for these surveys varies widely.

HOMOSEXUALITY 89, 96 (2001) (providing an overview of the study and its results). 22 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 In examining the existing literature, Rebecca Stotzer found that few studies examined the reasons why trans individuals seem reluctant to seek police assistance after being victimized.  The few studies that did examine this question in more depth concluded that trans people often fear discrimination or ridicule from law enforcement or have been discouraged from contacting police because of previous negative experiences.138 Second, and relatedly, previous studies have found that when trans individuals do interact with police, they face a heightened risk of discrimination and abuse.  Some of the best data on this subject come from a survey of 6450 trans and gender nonconforming individuals from all fifty U.S. states, organized by Jaime M. Grant and others.139  That study found significant evidence of police mistreatment.  Twenty-nine percent of all trans individuals and 46 percent of gender nonconforming individuals in the sample reported police officers treated them with disrespect.140  Six percent reported being physically assaulted by police, and 2 percent reported being sexually assaulted by police.141  Further, 22 percent of all trans individuals and 29 percent of gender nonconforming individuals in the survey reported being harassed by police.142  All of this may explain why “[a]lmost half of the respondents reported being uncomfortable seeking police assistance.”143  Another survey of 2376 individuals conducted by Lambda Legal found that nearly one-third of trans and gender nonconforming individuals faced hostile interactions with police, nearly one-quarter of trans individuals reported being verbally assaulted by police, and a smaller but significant percentage reported being physically assaulted or sexually harassed.144 Unfortunately, the existing literature does not definitively identify why trans individuals appear particularly likely to become victims of police abuse.  Nevertheless, there may be reason to believe that the mistreatment of the trans community by police stems in part from a transphobic culture common within U.S. law enforcement.  Policing scholars agree that officer misconduct is often rooted in a department’s organizational culture.145  Research by   138.

Abundant experiential evidence supports this notion. See, e.g., supra note 147 and accompanying text.  However, the number of police departments providing training on trans issues remains unclear.  Roughly 18,000 law enforcement departments exist in the United 24 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 department “implicitly condone[s] wrongdoing through the use of ‘lax supervision and inadequate investigation’ techniques,” then that department is “more likely to see ongoing misconduct than departments that aggressively enforce internal regulations.”150  Local law enforcement appears to have only begun to train officers in how to deal with trans suspects.  Not until 2014 did the Department of Justice make trans cultural competency training available to local law enforcement through its Community Relations Service.151  The FBI did not alter its Training Manual and Hate Crime Statistics Form to include information on trans individuals until 2012.152  Furthermore, even though the Department of Justice has agreed to settlements related to police misconduct153 to overhaul local police practices in at least thirty-one police departments, it has only recently begun to include antitrans-bias training in these agreements.154  More research is needed to evaluate the extent to which local police departments provide adequate training related to the trans community.  The existing evidence, though, is discouraging. 2.  Inherent Enforcement Challenges The evidence from the previous subpart illustrates that the law enforcement community is largely untrained and ill-equipped to enforce bathroom laws.  Compounding this lack of preparedness are the fundamental enforcement challenges involved in identifying individuals violating bathroom laws.  The majority of the proposed statutes require individuals to use bathroom facilities consistent with an individual’s biological “sex.”155  These statutes vary somewhat in how they define a person’s sex.  Most define sex at the chromosomal level,156 by the sex-designation given to a person at  States. BRIAN A.

These proposed laws put police in the unenviable position of guessing the chromosomal makeup or the sexual anatomy of private individuals entering a public bathroom.  Under Terry v. Ohio,159 a police officer would need reasonable suspicion to conduct a limited, investigatory stop against a civilian.160  To execute an arrest in such a situation, a police officer would need to have probable cause that a person was using a bathroom facility inconsistent with their chromosomal, anatomical, or otherwise designated sex.161  In cases where a trans individual is living their life and presenting in a manner consistent with their gender identity, it may prove practically impossible for a police officer to meet such an evidentiary standard—particularly given that no state could reasonably expect all persons to carry with them a copy of original birth certificate to present on demand to a suspicious law enforcement officer.  It could also create a high risk of false positives.162 C.  Incarceration Once police are given a license to enforce violations of bathroom laws as crimes, the number of trans individuals who may be taken into state custody would likely increase, at least temporarily.  Evidence suggests that, once incarcerated, trans individuals face a substantially higher risk of harassment and physical injury than members of other groups.163  At least eight empirical studies since 2003 have examined the lived experience of trans individuals in custodial settings.164  These studies indicate that trans individuals face a heightened risk of discrimination, verbal abuse, sexual harassment, physical assault, sexual assault, and violence.165  Thirty-eight percent of trans individuals and 29 percent of gender nonconforming individuals in the Grant survey reported being harassed by other inmates at jail or prison facilities,   157.

In Hercules, California, three high school boys attacked a fifteen-year-old trans boy while he used the boys’ restroom at his school.176  Two women viciously beat and spit on Chrissy Lee Polis, a trans woman, when she stopped to use a restroom at a McDonald’s in Rosedale, Maryland.177  In Danbury, Connecticut, a woman mistakenly thought another cisgender woman was trans and harassed her while she was washing her hands in a Wal-Mart bathroom.178  While boycotting Target for permitting trans individuals to use restrooms consistent with their gender identities, Anita Staver, president of the evangelical Christian legal organization Liberty Counsel, tweeted that she would be “taking a Glock .45 to the ladies room” because the weapon “identifies as [her] bodyguard.”179  And a sheriff candidate in Denton County, Texas, threatened physical violence toward trans women who used restrooms consistent with their gender identities.180   174.

Some bathroom bills, like those in Florida,181 Kansas,182 and Oklahoma,183 explicitly authorize private individuals to engage in enforcement by granting civil rights of action.  But even those that do not empower individuals in such a formal way may nevertheless contribute to vigilantism.  In sociological terms, these measures contribute to a sense of moral panic by ostracizing trans individuals as “folk devils.”184 III.  CHALLENGING BATHROOM LAWS AS STATUS CRIMES Once we understand many of the proposed bathroom laws as either directly or indirectly criminalizing bathroom use by trans individuals, we can turn to the question of whether such statutes criminalize the status of being trans.  In 1962, in Robinson v. California,185 the Supreme Court declared the criminalization of a status to be a violation of the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.186  Six years later, in Powell v. Texas,187 a split Court limited the Robinson doctrine to the proposition that states can criminalize voluntary conduct—even conduct linked to a status.188  In the years that followed, the Court has resisted efforts to further clarify the doctrine set out in Robinson and Powell.  This left the lingering question whether states may criminalize conduct that is so entwined with a status as to be inseparable and so constitutionally indistinguishable.189 Thus, this Part argues that the Court’s decisions in Robinson and Powell bar the criminalization of conduct that is integral to the existence of defendants and, as such, is tantamount to criminalization of their status.  Put another way, to criminally regulate necessary biological functions is to   181. See H.R. 583, 2015 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Fla. 2015).  182. See H.R. 2737, 2016 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Kan. 2016).  183.

This sociological and criminological classic explained how, on occasion, societies  appear to be subject . . . to periods of moral panic. A condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests; its nature is presented in a stylized and stereotypical fashion by the mass media; the moral barricades are manned by editors, bishops, politicians and other right-thinking people; socially accredited experts pronounce their diagnoses and solutions . . . .

Just as the Court in Robinson found a California statute criminalizing drug addiction to be constitutionally objectionable because it criminalized the defendant’s mere existence (as opposed to his actions), laws that criminally regulate bathroom use unconstitutionally criminalize the existence of trans individuals. On the most basic level, the act of going to the bathroom is “universal and unavoidable.”190  It is both “necessary for human survival”191 and “innocent.”192  Several of the proposed statutes offer trans individuals no means to safely use a public bathroom.  Use of a bathroom consistent with their gender identity becomes a crime193 and use of a bathroom consistent with their “biological sex”194 creates a risk of private violence.  This risk is particularly high in cases where a trans individual’s outward appearance is more traditionally consistent with their gender identity than their sex assigned at birth. This Part considers the history of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence with regard to status crimes.  It then evaluates the divergent perspectives taken by appellate courts in distinguishing between statuses and acts.  Finally, it draws on the language of the Ninth Circuit in Jones v. City of Los Angeles195 to argue that the criminalization of trans bathroom use may qualify as a violation of the Eighth Amendment.196 A.  Status Crimes Any first year law student can attest that, as a general principle, conviction requires proof of an act or, in rare cases, an omission.197  In 1962, the Supreme Court in Robinson considered a California statute that made it unlawful for a person to “be addicted to the use of narcotics.”198  The Court   190.

California, 370 U.S. 660, 660 (1962). The statute in question stated: No person shall use, or be under the influence of, or be addicted to the use of narcotics, excepting when administered by or under the direction of a person licensed by the State to prescribe and administer narcotics.  It shall be the burden of the defense to show that it comes within the exception.  Any person convicted of violating any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be sentenced to serve a term of not less than 90 days nor more than one year in the county jail.  The court may place a person convicted hereunder on probation for a period not to exceed five years and shall in all cases in which probation in granted require as a condition thereof that such person be confined in the county jail for at least 90 days.  In no event does the court have the power to absolve a person who violates this section from the obligation of spending at least 90 days in confinement in the county jail. 30 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 confirmed that conviction requires proof of an act, concluding that criminalization of a status alone not only runs contrary to this long-held principle, but also violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.199 Acknowledging that California has considerable authority to regulate illegal drugs and collateral crime that narcotics may spawn within its borders, the Court nonetheless struck down the statute.200  The problem with the statute was not that it punished a drug addict but that it punished him because he was an addict.201  The Court noted that the statute in question “makes the ‘status’ of narcotic addiction a criminal offense, for which the offender may be prosecuted ‘at any time before he reforms.’”202  The status of being a drug addict “may be contracted innocently or involuntarily” and would permit the state to punish even individuals who have “never touched any narcotic drug within the State or been guilty of any irregular behavior.”203  The Court concluded that punishing a person under such circumstances, even if the punishment is relatively mild, constitutes a violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.204 While the Robinson decision found statutes regulating status alone constitutionally wanting, it also hinted at a burgeoning debate.205  First, the Robinson Court seemed to draw a line between status—even statuses that might be socially harmful such as narcotic addiction—and criminal law.206  Robinson acknowledged that the state could regulate narcotic addiction and the social problems stemming from addiction in such civil realms as healthcare, education, or social welfare, but it could not criminalize being an addict.207  This border between crime and status, however, was limited.  A state could not criminalize the status of an addict, but California was free to criminally regulate the manufacturing, distribution, or possession of narcotics—even if this regulation affected addicts disproportionately or was  Id. at 660 n.1 (quoting CAL.

The Court in Robinson also brings up other examples of possible statuses that a state would not be permitted to punish, including mental illness and venereal disease.  This Article does not mean to suggest that the “status” of being trans is, in any way, comparable to a disease or illness.   205. Id. at 665–66.  206. See id.   207. See id. at 666.  Ironically, perhaps, some of these nonpunitive measures might result in involuntary commitment to a treatment or mental health facility.  This suggests that the Court’s true constitutional concern with the California statute was not that it regulated addiction or the behavior associated with it or that it produced a period of confinement based on that regulation but that it punished Robinson for being an addict. 2017] BATHROOM LAWS AS STATUS CRIMES 31 the product of their addiction.208  These twin components of the Robinson holding foreshadowed the debate to come. Six years after Robinson, in Powell v. Texas,209 the Court revisited these questions.  Powell had been convicted of public intoxication in violation of a Texas statute.210  At trial, Powell had claimed that “his appearance in public [while drunk was] . . . not of his own volition” but was a product of chronic alcoholism.211  In support of his position at trial, Powell introduced the testimony of a psychiatrist, Dr. David Wade, who characterized Powell as “a ‘chronic alcoholic,’ who ‘by the time he has reached [the state of intoxication] . . . is not able to control his behavior, and [who] . . . has reached this point because he has an uncontrollable compulsion to drink.’”212  As such, like other alcoholics, Powell was an “‘involuntary drinker,’ who [was] ‘powerless not to drink,’ and who ‘loses his self-control over his drinking.’”213  Even in conceding that Powell’s decision to take a first drink when sober was a “voluntary exercise of his will,” Dr. Wade added that “these individuals have a compulsion, and this compulsion, while not completely overpowering, is a very strong influence, an exceedingly strong influence.”214  Powell himself testified to a long history of alcohol abuse and public intoxication.215  The trial court was unimpressed and disallowed Powell’s defense of chronic alcoholism.216  Nonetheless, the court entered a defense-requested finding of fact that chronic alcoholism was a disease that destroyed the afflicted person’s free will, including his will to avoid public intoxication and that Powell was in fact a chronic alcoholic.217 Based on these findings, Powell argued on appeal that he did “not appear in public by his own volition,” but rather “under a compulsion symptomatic of the disease of chronic alcoholism.”218  As such, Powell argued, Texas’s regulation of his public intoxication was in fact a regulation of his illness or status as an alcoholic.219  While Texas was free to regulate the social woes associated with alcoholism, under the Robinson decision it was not free to criminalize Powell’s condition.220   208.

See id. 32 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 A four-member plurality of the Court rejected this argument, characterizing it and the findings of fact upon which it was based as a transparent attempt to bring Powell within the Court’s language in Robinson.221  In distinguishing the two cases, the plurality first questioned whether alcoholism was in fact a “status” (or more accurately, in the words of the Court, a disease or a mere symptom of other diseases).222  Beyond this, Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the plurality, noted that Texas was punishing Powell for his conduct of appearing drunk in public, rather than for the dubious status of being an alcoholic.223  Justice Marshall wrote that “[t]he entire thrust of Robinson’s interpretation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause is that criminal penalties may be inflicted only if the accused has committed some act, has engaged in some behavior, which society has an interest in preventing . . . .”224  In Powell, the Court seemed to jettison Robinson’s premise that social ills can and should be dealt with in the civil realm.  Instead, the plurality promoted the notion that states may criminalize actions that are the “product” of a status that the state seeks to control.225 Powell may have been based in part on the plurality’s unwillingness to recognize that alcoholism was in fact a status even though the Court in Robinson had recognized narcotic addiction as a status or illness.  The Powell plurality noted that there was no general agreement among the medical community about whether alcoholism constitutes a disease.226  There was also disagreement about whether alcoholism truly strips a person of his or her ability to control the amount of alcohol consumed.227  As the plurality reasoned:   It is one thing to say that if a man is deprived of alcohol his hands will begin to shake, he will suffer agonizing pains and ultimately he will have hallucinations; it is quite another to say that a man has a “compulsion” to drink, but that he also retains a certain amount of “free will” with which to resist.228 Turning to the question of what precisely Texas sought to regulate, the plurality contrasted the facts in Powell with the facts in Robinson.  Unlike in Robinson, the State of Texas was not punishing Mr. Powell for being a chronic alcoholic.229  Rather, Texas was punishing him for the act of being   221. See id. at 536–37.   222.

See id. at 525.  228. Id. at 526.  It is also worth noting that the Court went into great detail about the state of scientific understanding about alcohol addiction at the time of Powell.  The Court ultimately concluded that the available scientific evidence was far from incontrovertible regarding whether alcohol addiction could effectively eliminate free will. See id. at 526–31.   229. See id. at 532. 2017] BATHROOM LAWS AS STATUS CRIMES 33 in public while drunk.230  This distinction, though seemingly minute, was constitutionally significant.  The plurality reasoned that Texas sought to regulate Powell’s behavior as opposed to his status.231  This act—being intoxicated in public—could create a serious health and safety hazard both for Mr. Powell and for the public.232  Accordingly, the state had the power to criminalize it, even if the statute disproportionately affected those less capable of regulating such behavior themselves.233  In reaching this conclusion, the plurality rejected Powell’s claim that Robinson stood for the broader proposition that “criminal penalties may not be inflicted upon a person for being in a condition he is powerless to change.”234  The plurality worried that to adopt such a broad position would render the Supreme Court “under the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, the ultimate arbiter of the standards of criminal responsibility.”235  If the Eighth Amendment could bar prosecution of an alcoholic for being drunk in public, could it bar prosecution of an addict for possessing drugs or committing a theft to buy drugs?  Would the broad reading Mr. Powell urged bar the prosecution for murder of someone with an “exceedingly strong” impulse to kill?236 The plurality even compared Mr. Powell’s argument to an attempt to craft a sort of “insanity test” under the Eighth Amendment.237  The opinion stated: If a person in the “condition” of being a chronic alcoholic cannot be criminally punished as a constitutional matter for being drunk in public, it would seem to follow that a person who contends that . . . “his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect,” [under the so-called Durham test for legal insanity] would state an issue of constitutional dimension with regard to his criminal responsibility had he been tried under some different and perhaps lesser standard . . . .238 In other words, the plurality found it difficult to distinguish between Mr. Powell’s proposed extension of Robinson and an effective constitutionalization of the Durham test for legal insanity.239  Given this ambiguity, these Justices opted against taking a step that would hamper state autonomy to define and limit criminal responsibility.240  Ultimately, the   230.

The dissenting Justices argued for an expansion of the Eighth Amendment to protect against the criminalization of conduct that an individual is powerless to avoid.242  To these four Justices, the Constitution prohibited states from punishing a person for conduct that was “a characteristic part of the pattern of [a] disease [that is] not the consequence of [his] volition.”243 In the end, faced with a four-Justice plurality and a four-Justice dissent, the separate concurrence of the ninth member of the Court set the boundaries of the holding.244  Justice Byron White, concurring in the result, rejected the distinction between status and conduct, instead focusing on the voluntariness of Mr. Powell’s conduct.245  He wrote: If it cannot be a crime to have an irresistible compulsion to use narcotics, I do not see how it can constitutionally be a crime to yield to such a compulsion.  Punishing an addict for using drugs convicts for addiction under a different name.  Distinguishing between the two crimes is like forbidding criminal conviction for being sick with flu or epilepsy but permitting punishment for running a fever or having a convulsion.246 It may very well be the case, Justice White reasoned, that a chronic alcoholic could become so drunk in private that he would “lose[] the power to control his movements and for that reason appear[] in public.”247  Justice White concluded the Eighth Amendment would forbid punishment in such circumstances.248  But the record in Powell did not provide enough evidence to reach such a conclusion.249  Powell had been convicted not merely of use or possession of alcohol but for the separate act of being drunk in public, and so Justice White upheld the conviction as constitutionally sound.250   241.

Id.  2017] BATHROOM LAWS AS STATUS CRIMES 35 In its wake, the Powell decision left an uncertain constitutional line around the criminalization of status.  At least one commentator concluded that the Court in Powell “relegated [Robinson] to the outermost fringe of the criminal law by the narrow reading placed upon it.”251  Others are less certain.252  Between the plurality opinion, the dissent, and Justice White’s concurrence, it is difficult to delineate a definitive rule from Powell.  To be certain, Powell does not appear to overrule Robinson.253  It does appear, however, to significantly narrow the Robinson doctrine.  Taken together, the two cases seem to confirm the constitutional requirement that criminal laws must regulate some conduct by the defendant, with Justice White requiring that such conduct be voluntary.254  But the legacies of Powell and Robinson are more complex.  Just as Robinson prohibited criminalization of status, the dissent and White’s concurrence in Powell would seem to suggest that some conduct is so linked to status itself that it may not be constitutionally criminalized.  To paraphrase Justice White, it is the fever to the crime of flu.  This recognition of conduct entwined with status pushes against the plurality’s concern in Powell that overextension of the Robinson status doctrine could eviscerate the notion of criminal responsibility.  As lower courts have struggled to disentangle questions of conduct and status, the complexity of this debate is ever apparent. B.  Extending Status Crimes to Inextricably Linked Conduct The story of status crimes in the years following the decisions in Robinson and Powell has been largely one-sided as courts have increasingly declined to find statutes regulating conduct unconstitutional, even when the regulated conduct is closely linked to status.255  The use of the Robinson doctrine has been so limited that some scholars lament the lost opportunity to expand the constitutional limitations on criminal punishment.256  Others, however, have   251.

In large part, they have concluded that state regulations—even those that appear linked to status itself—are permissible under the Eighth Amendment so long as they restrict conduct as opposed to status.258 Efforts to draw a strict dichotomy between the criminalization of status and the criminalization of voluntary conduct have focused on the language of the Powell plurality.  For example, in Lehr v. City of Sacramento,259 a group of eleven homeless persons and three nonprofit charities brought a civil action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the City of Sacramento and the police in the hope of enjoining the enforcement of the city’s ordinance barring camping within city limits.260  As the plaintiff’s expert testified at trial, the majority of the homeless individuals in Sacramento “have neither a legal   257.

Scholars have also argued that a range of punishments violate the Eighth Amendment’s bar on status crimes.

These courts have examined the criminalized conduct in relation to the status claimed.  The most prominent of these cases is Jones v. City of Los Angeles.274  Similar to the Lehr case, the plaintiffs in Jones were a group of homeless individuals seeking to enjoin a Los Angeles ordinance that criminalized actions like sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks.275  As expected, the Jones court began its Eighth Amendment analysis by discussing Robinson and Powell.276  After walking through the history of these cases, the Jones court ultimately concluded that “five Justices in Powell understood Robinson to stand for the proposition that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the state from punishing an involuntary act or condition if it is the unavoidable consequence of one’s status or being.”277  The court also concluded that the articulation of this understanding by the Powell dissenters and Justice White in his concurrence was not mere dicta but rather was a point of agreement that had garnered the requisite five votes to be binding.278 In applying this interpretation of Powell and Robinson to the facts at hand, Jones made two important findings.  First, the court observed the fundamental unfairness of penalizing individuals for engaging in conduct that is necessary to sustain life.279  The acts that the Los Angeles ordinance criminalized—sitting, lying, and sleeping—are “unavoidable consequences of being human.”280  A person is “biologically compelled” to engage in this   273. See, e.g., Farber v. Rochford, 407 F. Supp. 529, 534 (N.D. Ill. 1975) (overturning a loitering statute as a status crime); State v. Adams, 91 So.3d 724, 751 (Ala. Crim. App. 2010) (holding that Robinson and Powell together “stand for the proposition that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment forbids punishing criminally not only a person’s pure status, but also a person’s involuntary conduct that is inseparable from that person’s status”).  274. 444 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2006), vacated by settlement, 505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007).   275.

(“It is undisputed that, for homeless individuals in Skid Row who have no access to private spaces, these acts can only be done in public.”).  Soon after this quote, the majority admonishes the dissenters for suggesting that a homeless person could simply avoid sleeping, lying, or sitting in public:  “The City and the dissent apparently believe that Appellants can avoid sitting, lying, and sleeping for days, weeks, or months at a time to comply with the City’s ordinance, as if human beings could remain in perpetual motion.” Id. 2017] BATHROOM LAWS AS STATUS CRIMES 39 conduct.281  It would be unreasonable to expect individuals not to engage in otherwise innocent and necessary conduct. Second, and relatedly, the court held that the life-sustaining conduct criminalized under certain circumstances in the Los Angeles ordinance was inextricably linked to the status of being homeless.282  Even if Los Angeles sought to criminalize “acts” and not status, given the lack of available housing, homeless individuals had no real voluntary choice—they must either break the law or cease to exist.  Their bodies required sleep, and alternative accommodations were not available.283  To survive, the homeless of Los Angeles would eventually be compelled to break the law.284  Thus, the court concluded that the Los Angeles statute amounted to “criminalizing Appellants’ status as homeless individuals.”285 In the context of bathroom laws, it is also worth noting that the judges in Jones included language about the meaning of status under the Eighth Amendment.  The Ninth Circuit noted that “[h]omelessness is not an innate or immutable characteristic, nor is it a disease, such as drug addiction or alcoholism.”286  Individuals may escape homelessness only to become homeless again in the future.287  Nonetheless, the court held that a statute need not criminalize an immutable characteristic to run afoul of the Eighth Amendment.288  It need only create a situation where an individual, because of her current condition, must choose between existence and lawfulness. The Jones court’s recognition of acts linked to status is not unique.  In other contexts, at least one Supreme Court Justice previously flirted with the idea that acts “so closely linked” to the status of being LGBTQ may be protected under the Robinson doctrine.289  Subsequently, at least one court has relied on the Robinson doctrine in suggesting that states cannot criminalize the status of being gay or lesbian.290 Likewise, Jones’s acknowledgment that the criminalization of transient status may offend the Eighth Amendment is not unique.  For juvenile offenders, the Supreme Court has held that offenses such as truancy, curfew violation, or unruliness that depend on the offender’s status as a minor must   281. Id.  282.

Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), where the majority upheld a state’s ban on sodomy, Justice Lewis Powell’s clerks “felt that the act of sodomy was so closely linked to the status of homosexuality that perhaps Robinson could be stretched to protect both from criminal prosecution.” Marc S. Spindelman, Reorienting Bowers v. Hardwick, 79 N.C. L. REV. 359, 408 n.151 (2001) (quoting JOHN C. JEFFRIES, JR., JUSTICE LEWIS F. POWELL, JR. 520–27 (1994)).

Supp. 697, 701–02 (N.D. Tex. 1977) (“[A] statute criminalizing [gay or lesbian] status and prescribing punishment therefore would be invalid.” (citing Robinson v.

In other contexts, however, states have been left free to criminalize behavior that is dependent on youthful status.  So called “juvenile status” offenses, such as “minor in possession of alcohol” or “minor in possession of a firearm,” survive constitutional muster despite the fact that the act of the defendant is criminal only because of her status as a minor.293 The story of status offenses is a mixed and often neglected history with courts struggling to define the precise parameters and protections of the Eighth Amendment as set forth in Powell and Robinson.  Despite this muddled history, there is at least some willingness to recognize that criminalization of conduct so closely linked to status may support Eighth Amendment challenges under Robinson and Powell.  Admittedly, the category of conduct that is inextricably linked to status is narrow.  Courts seem inclined to rely on this doctrine only in rare cases.  But as explained in the next subpart, the context of bathroom laws may be one of the few circumstances that warrant the extension of this doctrine to a new category of criminal statutes. C.  Applying Robinson to Bathroom Laws This Article contends that, should states pass laws that attempt to criminalize the use of bathrooms by trans individuals consistent with their gender identities (either as a stand-alone crime or a violation of existing statutes), such a law could constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Read together, the Court’s decisions in Robinson and Powell seem to suggest that while states may criminally regulate conduct linked to status, they may not criminally regulate conduct that is so entwined with the defendant’s   291. See Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 620–21 (1979).  292. See id. (holding due process protections did not extend to minors held on status offense in treatment and reform facilities).

To be sure, the category of conduct so tightly linked to existence is small, but given the biological imperative of bathroom use, regulation of such use based on trans status would appear to effectively criminalize the “status” of being trans.294  Given the serious consequences of criminalization—both in terms of official and vigilante enforcement—this recognition of bathroom regulation as status regulation would offer private civil rights advocates a narrow avenue through which to challenge the constitutionality of certain categories of bathroom laws. The argument proceeds as follows:  First, using a bathroom is a necessary biological function without which human existence fails.295  Second, existing laws prohibit the public exercise of this function outside designated spaces.296  Third, as a result of their status as living human beings, trans individuals have no genuine, voluntary choice when in public but to use public bathroom facilities when needing to exercise biological functions.  Fourth, bathroom regulations that prohibit a trans person from using a bathroom facility consistent with their gender identity create a Hobson’s choice for trans individuals.  If they obey the law and use a bathroom consistent with their “biological sex” as assigned at birth, they put themselves in serious risk of humiliation, embarrassment, and physical violence—particularly if their outward physical appearance is more in line with their gender identity.  If they use the bathroom facility consistent with their gender identity, they violate the law.  In short, because such laws are targeted specifically at trans individuals, and they criminalize conduct linked to existence, they criminalize the very existence of such individuals. Even if one adopts the position of the Powell concurrence that states may seek to regulate conduct linked to a status that produces social harm, there is no evidence that bathroom use by trans individuals actually produces such harm.  Despite the loud and hyperbolic claims to the contrary,297 experts have widely discredited the argument that the use of bathrooms by trans individuals consistent with their gender identities poses any safety risk.298    294. Courts need not recognize the trans community as a protected class of any kind to protect trans individuals from status crimes.  This Article does not take a position as to this issue.  295.

In other criminal law contexts, the Supreme Court has barred states from criminalizing harmless conduct.299 As seductively compact and efficient as the argument above may appear, there is more at play than the mere regulation of where an individual may perform particular biological functions.  Bathroom regulations for trans individuals, like the criminal regulation of addicts and the homeless, seek to draw boundaries around spaces of existence. Proponents of the bathroom bills decry the potential risk to women and children posed by trans individuals using bathroom facilities consistent with their gender identities.300  These same proponents argue that they do not seek to ban trans bathroom use altogether—rather, private bathrooms exist that trans individuals may use just as there are private spaces in which trans individuals can exist.301  They argue that bathroom regulations are less about criminalizing the status of being trans and more about criminalizing the conduct of bathroom use and the social harm that may flow from that use.302 That argument is tenuous at best and destructive at worst.  At its core, the argument seeks to preclude the physical presence of trans individuals in public settings by regulating their bodily functions.  It seeks to carve out only the narrowest spaces in which trans individuals can live and function as citizens and people.  It seeks to exclude them from the public spaces that people share in a communal recognition of what it is to be a human being.  In the process, it seeks to relegate the status of being trans to the status of being other, foreign, and subject to regulation.  Ultimately, this argument leads to exclusion, criminalization, and concealment. In sum, bathroom bills that propose the criminalization of trans bathroom use may run afoul of the Eighth Amendment by criminalizing seemingly involuntary, harmless, and life-sustaining conduct inextricably linked to the status of being trans.  While courts have been reluctant to extend the Robinson and Powell doctrine to many criminal law contexts, bathroom bills present a unique situation—one in which the majority has targeted a criminal prohibition at generally innocent conduct only in cases where it is inevitably committed by a disadvantaged minority.  In the larger scheme, though, such bathroom bills signal the further marginalization of the trans population.  While the Constitution may not explicitly recognize a right of human dignity, such recognition seems implicit in the Court’s prohibition of the criminalization of status.  However limited the Robinson holding may be after Powell, at a minimum it stands for the notion that criminal law cannot and should not outlaw people.   299. See, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 578–79 (2003) (striking down a Texas statute that prohibited consensual sexual activity between adults).  300. See supra note 86 and accompanying text.  301.

Possible Objections Critics may have many legitimate reasons for concern about this Article’s proposal to treat bathroom laws as status regulations.  This section seeks to recognize and address such objections.  First, and most obviously, such statutes arguably regulate conduct as opposed to status per se.  As such, they could survive a constitutional challenge under Powell.  Such a characterization, however, overlooks both the involuntary nature of the conduct regulated and the cobbled holding of Powell.  The need to use the bathroom, including at times public bathrooms, is a necessary biological function arguably no more avoidable than breathing in public.  It is innocent conduct criminalized only because of status—that of being a trans individual. Second, some may argue that being trans does not comport with the more traditional understanding of status under the Eighth Amendment.  To bolster this argument, critics may contend that trans individuals ultimately make a choice to identify as a gender different from their so-called “biological sex” assigned at birth.  Under this rationale, critics may argue that trans individuals are not barred from using public bathrooms under many proposed bathroom laws.  They are merely required to use a bathroom consistent with their “biological sex.”  If trans individuals are worried about the possibility of humiliation, violence, or other backlash, they could simply abstain from using public, sex-segregated bathroom facilities. The notion of trans status as “transitory” is hardly new to the Eighth Amendment debate on the criminalization of status.  The dissent in Jones argued that being homeless was not the kind of status typically protected from criminalization under the Eighth Amendment, as it can be a “transitory state” that “can change.”303  Likewise, the Powell plurality questioned the sufficiency of the permanence of alcoholism to establish it as a status.304 In the context of trans status, however, the primary argument of the transitory nature of trans identity misunderstands the lived experience of a trans person and the nature of status crime prohibitions under the Eighth Amendment.  For one thing, while the decision to live consistently with one’s gender identity may technically represent a choice of sorts, emerging scientific evidence calls into question whether the status of being trans is in fact a choice or a biological phenomenon.305  Beyond this, the fact that the   303.

The Court in Parham v. J.R.306 noted the inherently temporary nature of youth.307  The Jones court acknowledged that homelessness might not be constant.308  Each court confronted with an admittedly transitory status nonetheless found Eighth Amendment fault in criminalization of that status.  In each opinion, the constitutional offense arises from the criminalization of the status itself as opposed to the permanence of the status.  Neither Powell nor Robinson suggests that courts must view the concept of status so narrowly. Next, critics may claim that even if faced with a choice between criminalization or humiliation (or worse) when using public bathrooms, trans individuals can make a choice to use either private, single-occupancy, or gender-neutral bathrooms.  This critique suffers practical flaws, however.  It is premised on the notion that trans individuals have access to such facilities at the moment of need.309  As nearly any traveler can attest, the need for a bathroom and the presence of a bathroom do not always neatly align.  Likewise, not all public buildings or accommodations offer single-occupancy bathrooms.310  A careful examination of the bathroom laws proposed during the last four years reveals that virtually none of them require public buildings to provide trans persons with such an accommodation. Critics may also contend that criminal law defenses of justification or necessity are available to trans populations charged with violation of bathroom regulations or other criminal statutes, and, as such, no constitutional claim is necessary.  In Powell, Justice Marshall noted that “[t]he doctrines of actus reus, mens rea, insanity, mistake, justification, and duress have historically provided the tools for a constantly shifting adjustment of the tension between the evolving aims of criminal law and changing religious, moral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature of man.”311  Indeed, such defenses—particularly justification or necessity—may provide some shelter for trans individuals arrested and charged for violating a bathroom statute.  A justification defense permits a necessary and proportional response to triggering conditions.312  Likewise, a necessity  science-evidence/ [https://perma.cc/6FG7-PH6B] (noting that the question of whether or not trans status is biological is still open for debate).  306. 442 U.S. 584 (1979).  307. Id. at 602–03.  308. Jones, 444 F.3d at 1137.  309. See Jody L. Herman, Gendered Restrooms and Minority Stress:  The Public Regulation of Gender and Its Impact on Transgender People’s Lives, 19 J. PUB. MGMT. & SOC. POL’Y 65, 65–66 (2013) (documenting the level of harassment trans individuals reported when forced to use bathrooms inconsistent with their gender identity and the widespread lack of gender neutral bathrooms).  310. See id.  311. Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 536 (1968) (plurality opinion).  312. See Paul Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses:  A Systematic Analysis, 82 COLUM. L. REV. 199, 216 (1982) (describing justification defenses).  2017] BATHROOM LAWS AS STATUS CRIMES 45 defense allows noncompliance with the law if the harm resulting from compliance is greater than that resulting from violation.313 Each of these defenses are available to trans individuals confronted with the choice of risking harm or arrest when performing the necessary life function of using a bathroom in public.  The availability of such defenses, however, does not undo or solve the constitutional deficiency that arises from the criminalization of trans status.  Nor does the availability of the defense offer shelter from the humiliation and personal costs associated with arrest, trial, or the possibility of conviction if the fact finder concludes that the defense is unpersuasive. Finally, critics may contend that interpreting the criminalizing effect of bathroom bills as a violation of the Eighth Amendment’s bar on status crimes will open the door for challenges to a wide range of other criminal statutes.  This is the same fundamental argument made by the plurality in Powell and the court in Lehr.  Such a fear, however, seems unfounded. There is little reason to believe that an extension of the Robinson doctrine to this context would lead to any sort of slippery slope.  Bathroom laws present a unique situation of a state outlawing conduct—the use of bathroom facilities consistent with a person’s gender identity—only when committed by trans individuals.  This conduct is, for all practical purposes, necessary and life sustaining. This raises concerns about the voluntariness of the conduct criminalized by proposed bathroom laws and also suggests that the category of conduct that the state criminalizes under bathroom laws is decidedly narrow.  It is conceivable that a court could find that the unique character of bathroom laws runs afoul of Robinson by effectively outlawing involuntary conduct that is inextricably linked to the status of being trans without putting other criminal statutes at risk. Both Robinson and Powell recognized that there would be times when constitutional protection is required to prevent the criminalization of status.  The reluctance to find the need for such protection in Powell seemed to stem from the lack of evidence on the voluntary nature of the conduct in question and its link to the status alleged rather than a belief that status cannot or should not be protected from criminalization. CONCLUSION It does not appear that bathroom bills are going away.  The Trump administration has already removed the federal guidance that protected the ability of trans children to use the bathroom facilities consistent with their gender identity in public schools.  In the absence of such executive leadership on this issue, there is a greater need than ever for civil rights advocates to help turn the tide.  As more states and localities consider bathroom laws, researchers must be prepared to evaluate the long-term implications of these measures in a way that could sway state legislatures.  The academic community must be prepared to evaluate the most audacious claims made by   313. WAYNE LAFAVE, CRIMINAL LAW § 5.4(a) (3d ed. 2000). 46 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 supporters of these laws.  Advocates must be armed with concrete data on the likely costs and consequences of bathroom legislation. Should these measures become law in some states, scholars must be ready to offer concrete, empirical evidence about the implications of these measures.  Future research could empirically evaluate the preparedness of police to enforce such bathroom laws or qualitatively assess the impact of these measures on the well-being of the trans community. For the time being, though, it is important to recognize that many of these bathroom proposals do more than merely stigmatize trans individuals.  These measures are not just symbolic.  As discussed in this Article, recent proposals would effectively criminalize public bathroom use by trans individuals.  Criminalization comes with serious consequences.  It exposes the trans community to the risk of physical and emotional harm as members of the community come into more regular contact with criminal justice actors.  As shown in this Article, actors in the criminal justice system appear to be unprepared to handle this newfound responsibility.  Criminalization is not just bad public policy—it may very well be unconstitutional.  By criminalizing otherwise innocent, life-sustaining, and arguably involuntary conduct so inextricably linked to the status of being trans, some bathroom laws run afoul of the Eighth Amendment.  This may provide advocates with a narrow but important avenue through which to challenge the constitutionality of certain categories of bathroom laws. ",

    "abstract": "A growing number of American jurisdictions have considered laws that prohibit trans individuals from using bathroom facilities consistent with their gender identities. Several scholars have criticized these so-called “bathroom laws” as a form of discrimination in violation of federal law. Few scholars, though, have considered the criminal justice implications of these proposals. By analyzing dozens of proposed bathroom laws, this Article explores how many laws do more than stigmatize the trans community—they effectively criminalize it. Some of these proposed laws would establish new categories of criminal offenses for trans individuals who use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. Others would transform bathroom use by trans individuals into an unlawful trespass. The existing literature suggests that the criminal justice system is unprepared to handle this newfound responsibility. This Article concludes that, by effectively criminalizing noncriminal conduct so inextricably linked to the status of being trans, some proposed bathroom laws may violate the Eighth Amendment’s bar on cruel and unusual punishment",
