MATAMBANADZO* INTRODUCTION Law is the social, economic, political and personal struggle that determines who counts as a member of the community.  This struggle also determines how we should take account of the diverse interests of members of the community.  Which entities, individuals or collectives do we consider members of the legal community?  Of those entities, individuals and collectives, which rights, duties, privileges and protections should they enjoy?  Legal rules create the contours of recognition for various entities, individuals and collectives.  They define who counts and how we take account of them. Legal disputes in a variety of areas can be understood as determinations about who counts and how we should take account of them.  In family law, for example, custody disputes often concern determinations about which individuals are entitled to visitation or custody and which individuals are under an obligation to provide financial support.  Legal rules, like the best interests of the child standard,1 guide these determinations and shape adjudication.   *  Associate Professor of Law, Tulane University Law School.

The “best interests of the child” standard guides determinations by courts as to whom custody and visitation should be awarded and what type of custody or visitation should be awarded. Lynne Marie Kohm, Tracing the Foundations of the Best Interests of the Child Standard in American Jurisprudence, 10 J.L. & FAM. STUD. 337, 338, 357–60 (2008) (noting that an 1815 Pennsylvania case appeared to be “the first use of the best interests of the child as a legal standard”). Although the standard varies by state, it involves an assessment of factors such as the emotional ties to the parent, ties to the community, capacity of the parent to provide for the child’s physical and emotional needs, and the mental and physical health and fitness of the parent. See generally Determining the Best Interests of the Child: Summary of State Laws, CHILD WELFARE INFORMATION GATEWAY, http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/best_interest.cfm (last visited Oct. 30, 2012); UNHCR GUIDELINES TO DETERMINING THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD (2008), available at http://www.unhcr.org/4566b16b2.pdf. While the best interests of the child standard may take account of third party interests in some circumstances, there is a “presumption that parental decisions generally serve the best interests of their children . . . and clearly in the normal case the parent’s interest is paramount.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 86 (2000) (finding the right of the Matambanadzo Pagination Proof (Do Not Delete) 1/31/2013  2:56 PM 46 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 20:45 2012  Immigration law bases the right to remain within a specific geographic nation state on who counts – i.e. which individuals are citizens2 and permanent residents,3  and which undocumented individuals may be deported.4  The law also determines how we regard various diverse classes of foreign nationals to make determinations about which rights and considerations these individuals should enjoy.  For example, certain immigrants may be granted a permanent visa while others are not.5  In terms of federal tax law, the regulations governing joint or individual filing statuses determine which collective groups are recognized as a unit for the purpose of filing a federal tax return.6  One man and one woman joined in a state sanctioned marriage can file jointly under federal law, accessing particular tax incentives, while two men, two women or one man, and four women may not.7  Similarly, even though some families of two or more persons are prohibited from filing their taxes together, for the purposes of business ventures, groups of individual human beings shielded by the corporate form may file taxes together as a single unit.8 There are numerous ways to name the process of determining who counts  parent to control and care for her daughters primary to the right of the grandparents). This presumption ensures protection for the interests of parents in caring for their children. Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944) (“It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.”).  2.

In the United States, an “alien” has been defined as “any person not a citizen or national of the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3) (2006).  4. There are many classes of deportation, or removal. See 8 U.S.C. § 1227 (2006) (citing specific deportable statuses and criminal offenses, including improper entry by aliens).  5. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1153 (2006), visas are allocated by order of preference, including: specific members of citizens’ families, § 1153(a), employment-based visas, particularly for aliens with “extraordinary ability,” § 1153(b)(1)(A)), and limitations according to geographical regions, § 1153(c)), among others.  Implicit in § 1153 is that immigrants that would otherwise qualify for visas but who do not fall into the preferred categories may not be issued a visa. For example § 1153(b)(3)(B) states the following ‘limitation on workers’: “Not more than 10,000 of the visas made available under this paragraph in any fiscal year may be available for [unskilled workers].”  6. See I.R.C. § 1 (a)–(d) (2006) (outlining tax tables for married filing jointly, head of household, unmarried, and married filing separately returns); Treas.

Citizenship, 9 legal rights10 and legal subjectivity11 are various ways to speak about who counts in law and how we take account of them. Another way in which legal scholars talk about the issue of recognition for the purposes of structuring the legal community is accomplished through the concept of legal personhood.  At the dawn of the twenty-first century, legal personhood has become a political battleground for activists and legislators.  While some work to expand the community of legal persons to include unborn human beings like fetuses and zygotes,12  others focus their efforts on pushing the boundaries of legal personhood beyond human beings to include great apes or whales and orcas.13  And finally, some activists are concerned with limiting the community of legal persons to exclude collective legal entities like corporations, limited liability companies and unions.14   Recent activism concerning the status of persons and non-persons reveals how the legal boundaries of personhood have served as the background for   9. For example, women’s rights advocates use the frame of citizenship only insofar as the idea relates to equality (i.e. second-class citizenship). See Joanna L. Grossman, Pregnancy, Work, and the Promise of Equal Citizenship, 98 GEO. L.J. 567, 587 (2010) (stating that women’s rights advocates have “long pitched their arguments in citizenship terms,” including the fight for women’s suffrage). Since the Naturalization Act of 1790, U.S. immigration law has also enacted various reforms in order to designate citizenship status in terms of gender, race or ethnic identity, often depending on the particular political climate. See The Naturalization Act of 1790, 1 Stat. 103 (1790) (initially limiting citizenship to white men and operating to exclude racial minorities and women); see also The Act of July 14, 1870, 16 Stat. 254 (1870) (amending the Naturalization Act to include African Americans but to exclude non-white immigrants after the Civil War through the Act of July 14, 1870); Gabriel J. Chin, Segregation’s Last Stronghold: Race Discrimination and the Constitutional Law of Immigration, 46 UCLA L. REV. 1, 13 (1998) (stating that the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was “the first express racial restriction”).  10. Legal scholarship on the question of rights often invokes Wesley Newcomb Hohfield’s taxonomy of legal rights.  See Wesley Newcomb Hohfield, Some Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning, 23 YALE L. J. 16, 30 (1913).  Legal rights, however, have a long intellectual history that can be placed in conversation with other philosophical perspectives.  See, e.g., Joseph William Singer, Legal Rights Debate in Analytic Jurisprudence from Bentham to Hohfield, 1982 WIS. L. REV., 975, 986–1011 (1982).  Rights have been used in feminist discourse to articulate claims to legal recognition and equality.  See generally, Adelaide H. Villmoare, Women, Differences, and Rights as Practices: An Interpretive Essay and a Proposal, 25 LAW & SOC’Y REV. 385 (1991); Elizabeth M. Schneider, The Dialectic of Rights and Politics: Perspectives from the Women’s Movement, 61 N.Y.U. L. REV. 589 (1986).  11. Legal subjectivity  is often used in scholarship in diverse and ambiguous ways.  E.g., Jeanne L. Schroeder, Unnatural Rights: Hegel and Intellectual Property, 60 U. MIAMI L. REV. 453 (2006) (defining legal subjectivity as the capacity to respect the rule of law); but see Jeanne Lorraine Schroeder, Juno Moneto: On the Erotics of the Marketplace, 54 WASH. & LEE L. REV. 995 (1997) (defining legal subjectivity in relation to personhood and as legal rights and privileges). In some circumstances, legal subjectivity is used in conjunction with the concept of legal personhood.  See, e.g., Teemu Ruskola, Raping like a State, 57 UCLA L. REV. 1477, 1489 (2010) (“[T]he individual person has become the privileged paradigm of political and legal subjectivity: All rights and duties must be held by a ‘person.’ It is this juridico-political axiom that generates law’s fictional persons today.”); Sueann Caulfield, The Right to a Father’s Name: A Historical Perspective on State Efforts to Combat the Stigma of Illegitimate Birth in Brazil,  30 L. & HIST. REV. 1 (2012) (discussing legitimacy as a foundation for legal subjectivity).  Other scholars have connected legal subjectivity to citizenship.  See, e.g., Ratna Kapur, The Citizen and the Migrant: Postcolonial Anxieties, Law, and the Politics of Exclusion/Inclusion, 8 THEORETICAL INQUIRIES L. 527 (2007) (connecting citizenship to legal subjectivity).  12.

In light of the recent legal and political activity concerning the boundaries of personhood, this article argues that feminist legal theory should engage with the question of legal personhood.  To this end, it articulates one possible framework for a feminist legal theory of the person.  Drawing on the work of scholars in vulnerability studies and embodiment theory, this article imagines and proposes an analytic framework to aid those who make and interpret the law when faced with the twenty-first century challenges of legal personhood. Part I of this article examines the political battles around legal personhood in historical and contemporary contexts. It focuses on the diverse controversies concerning legal personhood for corporations and other associations, fetuses and embryos and non-human animals.  In Part II, it examines the concept of legal personhood from a theoretical perspective.  It simultaneously highlights the indeterminacy of legal personhood as a definitive concept and the normative force entailed by legal personhood in clarifying the distribution of rights, privileges and entitlements.  Part III begins to sketch one possible articulation of a feminist legal theory of the person from a perspective grounded in vulnerability studies and embodiment theory.  It provides one possible framework for addressing the twenty-first century challenges of legal personhood from a feminist perspective, arguing for an analytic framework that takes the body and embodied vulnerability as central and essential aspects of legal personhood. I. THE CHALLENGE OF LEGAL PERSONHOOD: HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND CONTEMPORARY CONTROVERSIES In both historical and contemporary contexts, battles concerning legal personhood structure the legal, social and political realities of the United States.  Historically, debates about legal personhood have had high stakes, concealing political contests regarding the distribution of legal privileges, political rights and social entitlements to groups and individuals.  Legal personhood animated many political challenges in the United States from its founding forward.  In the twenty-first century, legal personhood continues to create challenges to jurisprudence in the United States. Particularly in terms of battles concerning corporations, fetuses and embryos and non-human animals, controversies concerning legal personhood shaped political, social and legal activism.  And today, the battles concerning legal personhood mark the boundary lines of the legal community and highlight places of complexity and contradiction in the status quo. From the founding of the United States to the so-called “First Wave” suffragette struggles of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, controversies concerning legal personhood shaped political, social and legal activism.15  Historically, in the United States, the rights of personhood were   15.

Coverture, according to feminist thinkers like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, made women less than full persons under law, rendering them, “in the eye of the law, civilly dead.”17  In the United States, for example, while women were considered legal persons,18 they were accorded neither the rights and privileges nor the duties and obligations of full legal personhood.19 Women, like African Americans and others, were excluded from the full privileges and benefits of legal personhood.20  While women were considered citizens of the United States, they were often excluded from the statutory interpretation of persons eligible for certain rights and privileges under law.21  And once married, women were limited in their ability to exercise many basic capacities and rights of legal personhood at common law, such as making contracts and owning property.22  Women could lose their nationality as American citizens and the rights of American citizenship by marrying a foreigner.23  They could be explicitly excluded from juries by state   16.

Despite the hard work of suffragists and the hopes that the possibility of the franchise engendered, this amendment was not initially applied in a way that radically altered the position of women in the United States.  On the contrary, it was interpreted in a way that did not universally guarantee women the right to vote. Courts instead interpreted this amendment narrowly, claiming that it simply meant that while states could not pass legislation explicitly prohibiting women from voting, they could systematically apply requirements for the franchise that would severely curtail the right to vote for most women.28  The accordance of a positive right to vote was left to the states to confer upon women.  Thus many women gained the de jure right to vote while de facto exclusion from the franchise was still permissible.29 Struggles to expand the boundaries of legal personhood have long been part of the feminist legal project, not only in terms of protecting and expanding the legal personhood of women.  In the nineteenth century, many feminists in the United States were part of the abolitionist movement which sought to expand the scope of legal personhood to include African Americans as free individuals.30  Many feminist abolitionists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton regarded the conditions of marriage and the status of coverture31 to be akin to slavery.32  In the nineteenth   24.

It was not until 1964 that Minor was effectively if “silently” overturned in Reynolds v. Sims. 337 U.S. 533, 612–13 (1964) (holding that the Constitution protects the right of all qualified citizens to vote) (Harlan, J., dissenting).  30. Feminist abolitionists, who had diverse perspectives as to the substance and meaning of emancipation for free and enslaved women, were crucial voices in the abolitionist movement.

Id.  32. The loss of “self-ownership,” which included the ability to contract and the right to refuse sexual relations with one’s husband, was regarded as especially pernicious.  Id. at 176–77.  This comparison between slavery and coverture did not only emerge from the feminist movement.  The link between slavery and coverture has often been made in a comparative fashion because women and African Americans were both denied full access to legal personhood. E.g., Gentry v. McMinnis, 33 Ky. (3 Dana) 382, 384 (1835) (“Actual slavery is a disability even greater than that of infancy or coverture, and is surely entitled to, at least as much indulgence and protection. A person held and Matambanadzo Pagination Proof (Do Not Delete) 1/31/2013  2:56 PM  EMBODYING VULNERABILITY 51 century, feminists in the U.S. actively participated in the abolitionist movement, seeking increased recognition of the legal personhood of African Americans and women in terms of political and social equality.33  From late nineteenth century activists fighting for suffrage and full citizenship rights for all persons, both male and female,34 to mid-twentieth century legal battles attempting to cast off the disabilities of coverture,35 women in the United States have fought not only for legal personhood but also for the citizenship rights essential to realize the fullest form of legal personhood possible.  In a global context, in spite of efforts in international law to ensure full equality for women,36 discriminatory laws  governed as a slave, is not either physically or intellectually a free agent.”).  33. Before emancipation, enslaved individuals occupied a liminal legal status where they were simultaneously recognized as persons and property. See, e.g., Sneed v. Ewing and Wife, 28 Ky. 460 (5 J.J. Marsh 1831) (recognizing slaves were persons and had personal attachments but were also property that could be moved and sold at any time); see also COLIN DAYAN, THE LAW IS A WHITE DOG: HOW LEGAL RITUALS MAKE AND UNMAKE PERSONS 140 (2011) (arguing law did not erase personhood for slaves but “disfigured” it). Enslaved persons were effectively people without rights who could not contract, access the courts, own property, control the sale of their labor or retain their bodily integrity. See ANDREW FEDE, PEOPLE WITHOUT RIGHTS: AN INTERPRETATION OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE LAW OF SLAVERY IN THE SOUTH 201 (1992).  Even black individuals who acted free, seeming to hold title to property and their persons were still considered slaves. See Burke v. Negro Joe, 6 G. & J. 136 (Md. 1834) (finding a deed of manumission could not be presumed unless actions inconsistent with slavery were known to the putative owner even though the enslaved individuals owned property, contracted debts and rented farm within three miles of putative owner’s home). Even in cases where African Americans were not slaves, they were not granted full access to legal personhood. E.g., Bryan v. Walton, 14 Ga. 185, 198 (1853) (“Whereas, we maintain, that the status of the African in Georgia, whether bond or free, is such that he has no civil, social or political rights or capacity, whatever, except such as are bestowed on him by Statute; that he can neither contract, nor be contracted with; that the free negro can act only by and through his guardian; that he is in a state of perpetual pupilage or wardship; and that this condition he can never change by his own volition.”). In fact, many cases made no distinction between free and enslaved black persons. E.g., State v. Baynard, 1 Del. Cas. 662, (Del. 1794) (noting that because of servile status “it would be both illegal and impolitic” to admit the testimony of black persons).  34.

REV. 947 (2002) (using a synthetic interpretation of the constitution to examine the history of the women’s suffrage movement and to link the Fourteenth Amendment with the Nineteenth Amendment).  35. See Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 280–81 (1979) (finding that gender was not an “accurate proxy” for financial need, overturning a statute that required husbands to pay alimony but did not similarly require wives to pay alimony); Reed v.

L. REV. 1373 (2000) (examining the history of contemporary laws providing reduced criminal penalties for rapes committed by husbands against their wives).  Women and men are still treated differently under United States law in many circumstances.  E.g., Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 62 (2001) (differentiating between women and men who have illegitimate children on foreign soil); see also Michael M. v.

In the twenty-first century, legal personhood has emerged as a contested issue of which feminist theory should take account.  Currently, human beings that have been born are considered persons for the purposes of law, even if they are not treated equally in terms of status.39  From the halls of the legislature, to  2012) (stating as Goal 3: “to promote gender equality and to empower women” through  “[e]liminat[ing] gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015”).

See CEDAW, supra note 36. But in 2009, President Hamid Karzai signed a family law that “negates the need for sexual consent between married couples, tacitly approves child marriage and restricts a woman’s right to leave the home.”  Jerome Starkey, Afghan Leader Accused of Bid to ‘Legalise Rape’, THE INDEPENDENT, March 31, 2009, available at http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/afghan-leader-accused-of-bid-to-legalise-rape-1658049.html. Also, while the U.S. is a signatory to CEDAW, it has not ratified it into law. See CEDAW, supra note 36. Current U.S. immigration law still distinguishes citizenship requirements based on gender outside the marriage construct. See 8 U.S.C. § 1422 (2006) (“The right of a person to become a naturalized citizen of the United States shall not be denied or abridged because of race or sex, or because such person is married.”). Yet the Supreme Court of the United States has validated laws that treat U.S. citizen mothers and fathers differently in terms of the requirements that must be met in order to pass on citizenship to a child born outside of marriage. See Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 62.  38. The legal personhood of women and the citizenship rights arising in part from legal personhood has also been influenced by other aspects of identity.  Structural impediments arising from discrimination due to undocumented citizenship status, race, sexual orientation, disability and class also play an important role in shaping the contours of legal personhood for individuals on the ground.  39. Not all human beings are equally treated to all of the rights of personhood. Children are persons whose status as a minor insulates them from some liabilities and duties and denies them access to particular rights and privileges. In both historical and contemporary contexts children have been treated as if they were property. See Marvin R. Ventrell, Rights & Duties: An Overview of the Attorney-Child Client Relationship, 26 LOY. U. CHI. L.J. 259, 261 (1995) (noting that before the nineteenth century children were regarded as chattel); Leigh Goodmark, From Property to Personhood: What the Legal System Should do for Children in Family Violence Cases, 102 W. VA. L. REV. 237, 252 (1999) (arguing custody decisions often reflect interests of parents and treat children like chattel). Undocumented persons, who lack the robust protections of citizenship, have also been excluded from the community of persons in terms of basic legal rights and privileges. See Hiroshi Motomura, The Rights of Others: Legal Claims and Immigration Outside the Law, 59 DUKE L.J. 1723, 1782 (2010) (examining how immigrants “obliquely or indirectly” assert rights under law); Fran Ansley, Constructing Citizenship Without a Licence: The Struggle of Undocumented Immigrants in the USA for Livelihoods and Recognition, 4 STUD.

Legal personhood for corporations and other juridical persons, human embryos and fetuses, animals and human/animal hybrids and others has become the subject of controversy, activism and political action.  The following sections highlight the problem of personhood by examining law reform efforts from various parties, including local grass roots activists and high-profile national figures.  It examines the problem of personhood with a focus on controversies concerning corporations, fetuses and embryos and non-human animals. A.  The Controversy of Corporate Personhood Corporate personhood has become a controversial proposition in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.40  This decision expanded political speech rights for corporations, noting that corporations and other associations should not be treated differently under the First Amendment simply because they are not individuals.41  After all, “[t]he First Amendment protects more than just the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphleteer.”42  Drawing on these principles, one could surmise that the First Amendment protects the speech of corporations in part because of the individuals collectively associating behind the corporate form.43  While some have hailed the decision as a positive expansion of political speech for associations44 and a logical extension of the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence in First Amendment law,45 others have argued it is a problematic expansion of political rights for corporations and corporate personhood.46  One of the most   40.  130 S. Ct. 876, 886 (2010) (holding that “[t]he Government may regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not suppress that speech altogether”).  41. See id. at 898–900.  42. Id. at 917 (Roberts, J., concurring).  43.  Justice Scalia’s spirited concurrence, in particular, highlights the role of individuals in corporations and associations.  See id. at 929 (Scalia, J., concurring).  According to Justice Scalia, “[t]he [First] Amendment is written in terms of ‘speech,’ not speakers. Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker, from single individuals to partnerships of individuals, to unincorporated associations of individuals, to incorporated associations of individuals—and the dissent offers no evidence about the original meaning of the text to support any such exclusion.” By highlighting the role of the individual in a collective association, this reading of Citizens United reveals a continued deference to a theoretical “take” on these matters that mirrors the nineteenth century “organicist view” of the corporation, regarding corporations as collectives that have life separate from the individuals that form them.  Gregory A. Mark, Comment, The Personification of the Business Corporation in American Law, 54 U. CHI. L. REV.  1441, 1469–70 (1987).  However, it is important to note that corporations, like other legally recognized collective associations, can be created by single individuals or groups of individuals. Instead of being essentially collective, one commentator even characterized it as “essentially a collection of capital.” Mark M.

Outrage over corporate personhood was a reoccurring theme of the Occupy Wall Street Protests in 2011.  According to NPR’s Melissa Block,”[a]mong the demands of Occupy Wall Street protestors is this, an end to corporate personhood. That demand has been spelled out on protestors signs, like one that reads: I’ll believe corporations are people when Texas executes one.”  What is the Basis for Corporate Personhood?, NPR All Things Considered (October 24, 2011), available at http://www.npr.org/2011/10/24/141663195/what-is-the-basis-for-corporate-personhood.

In discussing the post-Citizens United status quo, former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich notes, “[f]ive members of the Supreme Court think corporations are people. Mitt Romney agrees.

Fetuses and Embryos: The “Pro-Life” Personhood Movement Corporations are not the only legal subjects that may present significant challenges to the current conception of legal personhood in the United States.  While some have attempted to roll back the expansion of legal recognition for corporate persons, others have made attempts to expand the community of legal persons in the United States by seeking recognition for fetuses and embryos. While the U.S. Constitution does not define the concept of a person explicitly, according to the Supreme Court, ‘‘the word ‘person,’ as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn.”65  Some states, however, have made efforts to expand constitutional protections for fetuses and embryos.  The state of Georgia has been on the cutting edge of these legal efforts.  In 2009, the Option of Adoption Act was passed, which changed the definition of “child” to include a human embryo.66  That same year, S.R. 328 was passed. This bill acknowledged “the right to life is paramount and the need for protection of the lives of the innocent at every stage.”67  Georgia legislators have introduced a significant amount of legislation proposing expanded personhood protections for fetuses and embryos.  For example, in 2007, the Georgia state house proposed HR 536, the “Paramount Right to Life” amendment.  This amendment would extend constitutional protection to unborn children “from the moment of fertilization without regard to age, race, sex, health, function, or condition of dependency.”68  In 2009, a proposed amendment to the Georgia Constitution stated that the “right to life is vested in each human being from the moment of fertilization.”69  In 2011, this amendment was reintroduced as H.R. 1072.70   Georgia is not alone.  Over two thirds of the states have passed legislation providing some legal recognition of fetuses for the purposes of homicide,71 or for  included in these limitations on constitutional legal personhood.  65.

In Wyoming, criminal liability can arise from the crime committed against the mother and the death of the unborn fetus. E.g., Goodman v. State, 601 P.2d 178, 185 (Wyo. 1979) (holding that an individual can be prosecuted for the crime of assault and battery on a mother and the death of the fetus incident to the criminal act).

CODE § 61-2-30(c) (2011) (recognizing a fetus or embryo as a separate victim distinct from its mother in a crime of violence against the person); TENN. CODE ANN. 39-13-107 (2011) (including viable fetuses in the definition of persons for the purposes of assault); S.D. CODIFIED LAWS § 21-5-1 (2004) (defining fetuses as persons for the purposes of wrongful death statutes).  Many states are considering “heartbeat” bills that would expand fetal personhood and limit abortions.  For example, the Ohio Heartbeat Bill would outlaw abortion after a heartbeat can be detected, which is generally between six and seven weeks. H.B. 125, 129th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Oh. 2011).

The law makes it a felony to perform an abortion after twenty or more weeks unless the mother’s life is in danger, requires physicians performing abortions to report the procedure within thirty days to be compiled in an annual report and provides a right of action for women who have had abortions in violation of the law against the physician performing the abortion, NEB. REV. STAT. ANN. § 28-3,102 (LexisNexis 1995), L.B. 1103, 102nd Leg., Reg. Sess., (Neb. 2011). Oklahoma has also passed a similar act, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. OKLA. STAT. ANN. tit. 63, § 1-745.1 (West 2011), H.B. 1888, 50th Leg., 2011 1st  Reg. Sess. (Okla. 2011). And in Utah, the legislature has passed a law requiring fetuses that are about to be aborted to be given some sort of pain medication. See UTAH CODE ANN. § 76-7-305 (West 2011). Activists in many other states have tried to expand the legal recognition of fetuses.  For example, Alabama enacted the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. ALA. CODE § 26-23B (2011). The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act was introduced to the Arkansas House, but the bill died in the House Committee, H.B. 1887, 88th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ark. 2011).  The Act would have banned abortions after twenty weeks unless they are performed to save a mother’s life and requires doctors to report abortions performed to the Arkansas Department of Health.  Id. The bill mirrored a law passed by Nebraska in 2010 which was the first of its kind in the United States.

Reproductive technology has facilitated the possibility of separate existence for human tissue, creating indeterminacy in law for a variety of individuals, entities and collectives.  For example, questions about what happens to unimplanted embryos may arise for potential parents and for the facilities housing these unused embryos.  While some of these issues may be resolved through contracts between potential parents and the facilities in question, or between the potential parents themselves, the legal status of embryos does not lend certainty to these scenarios.  In the United States, embryos currently occupy a place of liminal legal recognition, receiving different levels of protection and recognition in different jurisdictions.  In some jurisdictions they are juridical persons,78 while in others they are property subject to contract law79 or occupy an intermediate space between persons and property.80  legislation.

Animal Activism and the Possibilities of Personhood  The legal status of animals has also become an area of scholarly and political dispute.81  The exclusion of non-human animals from the legal status of personhood has theoretical roots that can be traced to the teleological worldview of ancient Greek and Roman philosophers,82 and to metaphysical religious traditions of “Western” thought.83  In the United States, as in many other English-speaking countries, non-human animals are not persons but “things.”84  As things, animals are considered property and not generally eligible for the full scope of legal protections, rights and privileges enjoyed by human beings or other persons like corporations.85  A recent case, brought by activists from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) on behalf of killer whales owned by Sea World, held that non-human animals were not part of the community of persons recognized by the Thirteenth Amendment.86   The status of animals as property, however, does not mean that they have been completely excluded from the community of persons.  Animals occupy the legal status of quasi-persons, being recognized as holding some rights and protections but not others.  Although animals generally lack standing to sue on their own behalf, in some limited circumstances, non-human animals have been accorded standing to sue through a guardian ad litem.87  Currently, one state, one  between persons and property because they have the potential for human life).  This interim category approach has been used in various contexts.  See generally In re Marriage of Witten, 672 N.W.2d 768 (embryos); A.Z. v. B.Z., 725 N.E.2d 1051 (2000) (embryos); Janicki v.

Although some may claim that the questions of legal personhood have been settled,100 or that the best course of dealing with questions of legal personhood is not to think about them,101 the recent political action around fetal and corporate personhood—and the future challenges emerging from individuals and entities formerly conceptualized as things—shows us that the legal contours of personhood are open to new interpretations and possibilities.  If, as W.E.B. Dubois noted, the problem of the twentieth century was the color line,102 one could argue that the problem of the twenty-first century will become the lines we draw in law between persons and non-persons.   In the wake of populist responses to the Supreme Court’s expansion of political speech rights for collectives and associations shrouded in juridical personhood, the re-emerging debate around the legal status of embryos and fetal personhood and the arising issues regarding the potential recognition of animals as legal persons, it is time for legal scholarship—particularly in feminist theory—to re-engage with the question of legal personhood and its meaning. The continuing challenges of personhood should matter to feminist legal theorists for several reasons.  First, constructing the contours and limits of the community of persons has consistently been part of the feminist legal project.  From the early efforts of suffragettes103 to contemporary feminist efforts to examine intersectionality,104 equality,105 motherhood,106 family,107 sexuality108 and  Toward a General Theory of Constitutional Personhood: A Theory of Constitutional Personhood for Transgenic Humanoid Species, 39 UCLA L.

Solum, Legal Personhood for Artificial Intelligences, 70 N.C. L. REV. 1232 (1992). Like artificial intelligence and robots, some other non-natural entities or things might push the boundaries of personhood. For example, Oliver Wendell Holmes has noted that “[a] ship is the most living of inanimate things. Servants sometimes say ‘she’ of a clock, but every one gives a gender to vessels.” OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, THE COMMON LAW 26 (1909).  99.

An expansion of political speech for associations may flood a democratic conversation where women’s voices are already marginalized.  It may also enable powerful associations to deploy their economic privilege to blunt crucial substantive procedural rules designed to protect women, including protections from discrimination, family and medical leave, and worker protections.  Moreover, efforts to expand legal recognition for fetuses and embryos – and the rights arising from it – may narrow the rights and reproductive choices of women.  For these reasons, feminist legal theory should engage with the challenges of legal personhood.  II. THE MEANING OF PERSONHOOD IN LAW: THE INDETERMINACY OF A LEGAL FICTION The current controversies concerning legal personhood and the political efforts to limit or expand the community of persons reveal how the meaning of legal personhood is plagued by uncertainty and indeterminacy.  In law, “person” is often used in a confusing fashion.111  The boundaries of legal personhood may seem, at best, inconsistent and, at worst, arbitrary.  Jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it is often unclear who counts as a person in law and why.  Different jurisdictions have created different thresholds for personhood and different distributions of rights, privileges, protections and entitlements, such that the same individual or entity might be recognized as a person in one place and property in another.112  And even within jurisdictions, the same entity might be treated as a member of the legal community of persons for one purpose, but not another.113  This creates a legal regime in which different entities, individuals and collectives are treated differently, and in which similar entities, individuals or collectives are subject to different legal requirements and different degrees of recognition, even when they are similarly situated. In the United States’ common law tradition there is no discrete body of law  MOTHER, THE SEXUAL FAMILY AND OTHER TWENTIETH CENTURY TRAGEDIES (1995) [hereinafter SEXUAL FAMILY].  107. E.g., Frances E.

In contrast, persons and the rights and liabilities arising from legal personality play a crucial role in the civil law tradition.  In civil law jurisdictions, the law of persons is laid out in a codified set of principles and in private law.  For example, the Louisiana Civil Code contains an entire section concerning the contours of legal personhood and its application in law.116  Legal personhood is considered the “benchmark” for the distribution of rights and entitlements in civil law.117  The law of persons has legal and ethical force and, in some cases, even makes distinctions between physical and moral persons.118 Many legal scholars reduce the Latin meaning of person, Pers na, to the mask worn by players in dramatic performances.119  Max Radin noted that “there can be no doubt that ‘person’ is the Latin persona, the Greek prosopon, and that originally these words meant a ‘theatrical mask,’ familiar to us as one of the devices of the Greek and Roman theatre.”120  The origins and meanings of       Pers na, however, are more complex.  Some who specialize in etymology claim that the word Pers na comes from an Etruscan word that is derived from the Greek word prosopon, meaning face.121 Tracing the origin of the person to the face and not to a theatrical mask provides insight into the concept of the person that is useful for understanding its contemporary and historical operation in law.

For example, Delaware, the leading jurisdiction for creating juridical persons for business purposes, defines a person broadly to include a variety of juridical persons in its definition. In Delaware, “person” means a natural person, partnership (whether general or limited), limited liability company, common law trust, business trust, statutory trust, voting trust or any other form of trust, estate, association (including any group, organization, co-tenancy, plan, board, council or committee), corporation, government (including a country, state, county or any other governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality), custodian, nominee or any other individual or entity (or series thereof) in its own or any representative capacity, in each case, whether domestic or foreign.

And in spite of its relational purpose, the mask is incompatible with life and is inanimate.123  For Johnson, a mask is “[s]omething inanimate always approximat[ing] an ideal . . . [but] [a]n ideal is not an individual.”124  The face, in contrast, is living and is often considered to be a unique representation of an individual’s soul or innermost essence.125  The face also entails an ethical relational imperative.  Drawing on Emmanuel Levinas’ claim that the living face represents the ethical claims of the human Other, Johnson notes that the face is open and public and that it entails knowledge of the Other and thus, ethical responsibility.126  Associating the face with the person entails acknowledging the importance of an animate existence in our legal interactions, one where moral and relational ethos must be acknowledged.  It is also, for human beings and other mammals, a communicative organ that is thought of as the external representation of some internal identity or essence that is often conceptualized as authentic.  It is taken to manifest our emotional and intellectual life in the social spaces where we interact.  But the face is not a perfect proxy for truth as an authentic representation of the individual.  Because the face is also capable of deceit and technological perfection, it is capable of manipulating others who observe it. As the face is the representation of the individual in social interactions, the person is the representation of the individual in legal interactions.  Scholars have described the person in law as the “subject of legal rights and duties.”127  For this reason, the act of recognizing an individual, entity or collective as a person determines a variety of potential legal capacities, including who can act in law (legal persons) and who cannot act in law (non-persons).  It also determines which sorts of beings can claim the protection of the law through political, social and legal rights and entitlements, and which sorts of beings have moral responsibilities, obligations and duties that the law will enforce.128  Conferring legal rights and duties, for this reason, confers legal personality on persons.129  Bryant Smith went further in his analysis, defining legal personality as the capacity for legal relations.130  Capacity is a concept that entails not only current abilities but also possible unrealized potential that is yet to come.131  For this reason, legal personality is often conceptualized as relational capacity and   122.

For example, Margaret Radin has argued that property plays a crucial role in defining persons.134  Beyond the common law and in a more contemporary context, other scholars have argued that personhood in law is a “placeholder for deeper concepts that ground our moral intuitions about human rights.”135  For example, Jens Ohlin argues that the word “person” does not stand for a single legally applicable concept but a cluster of ideas.136  The first cluster of ideas centers on a naturalistic concept of the person in law embodied by the human being.  The second cluster of ideas focuses on the rational agency of entities or individuals, and takes account of psychological or cognitive aspects of persons and of the capacity of persons to be culpable for moral choices.  The third piece of the cluster of legal personhood describes what Ohlin calls the normative concept of legal personhood.  The normative concept of legal personhood recognizes that persons are the objects, entities or individuals that are morally and legally recognized as holders of rights and subjects with their own interests.  This conception of the person is premised on the idea that “[w]e do not ascribe human rights because an entity is a person – it is a person because we ascribe human rights to it.”137  For this reason, the concept of the person, which is used for many purposes, often clouds the already murky water of legal issues; ”[r]ather than illuminating human rights claims, the concept of the person often obscures them.”138  While this does not mean the concept of a person in law is empty, many scholars maintain it is not necessary for human rights and it should not be the “central battleground” for discussions of human rights.139  Pragmatist John   132.

For Dewey, “‘person’ signifies what law makes it signify.”140  But even such an approach to personhood requires conceptual frameworks and analytic foundations as a starting point for making its determinations. Even with such extensive scholarly endeavors, the legal meaning of personhood is still uncertain and indeterminate.  Pragmatic attempts to endow entities, individuals and collectives with rights, entitlements and privileges, or to impose duties and obligations on them, have led to a fragmented jurisprudence of legal personhood.  Because the community of legal persons is diverse, the challenges of legal personhood have been met by a variety of pragmatic solutions that have left it indeterminate in its theoretical foundations and piecemeal in its approach to new challenges.  The meaning of legal personhood shifts depending on what sort of persons one is talking about and what the dominant legal framework of analysis in question is.141 In spite of this theoretical indeterminacy, legal personhood – for all the aspects of its meaning that entail transcendental nonsense – is more than a legal fiction.  It is important to remember that while the category of person is a legal fiction, the concept still carries normative, ethical and political force.142  The stakes of legal personhood are high and entail meaningful determinations about how we impose obligations and duties, and which individuals, entities, and associations have access to rights, privileges and entitlements.  Legal personhood plays an important role in cultivating the community of those individuals, collectives and entities whose rights, privileges and entitlements are worthy of recognition in law.  Legal personhood, however, is not merely an individual concept.  Collective entities have the capacity to form a variety of associations that receive the protections of separate legal personhood apart from the human beings and juridical persons that comprise them.  Legal personhood also pushes the boundaries of individuality in so far as it is a tool to facilitate interactions between various legally recognized persons.  It mediates those relationships, determining which particular individuals, entities and collectives hold intelligible claims that can be addressed through law.143  Legal personhood, for this reason, is more than just a placeholder for rights, entitlements, privileges and obligations.144  The naming of an entity, individual or collective as a person has moral force in so far as it turns something, which is defined by its lack of access to rights, privileges and entitlements, into someone.  The process of making some individuals persons also renders them subject to obligations and duties, making them accountable to the community and   140. Dewey, supra note 101, at 655.  141.

In spite of its importance, the legal recognition of a person is never completely realized by any individual legal person or group of legal persons.  Most individuals do not possess the abilities to exercise all the rights of personhood at once even if the law has deemed them capable of acting.  There is not one legal treatment of persons because there is no singular definition of persons – there are diffuse standards to meet the needs of diverse classes of persons.  In this way, personhood is a bundle of rights, entitlements, privileges, obligations and duties that are distributed to different types of legal persons in different ways.  Furthermore, personification does not necessarily entail the same collection of rights, privileges and entitlements, or the same sort of capacities for each person recognized.146  Personhood can be disaggregated. However, declaring an individual or entity a “someone” for the purposes of one particular entitlement or privilege means that “someone” has access not only to that one slice of recognition initially endowed to it but also is able to expand this recognition.147 The legal meaning of personhood is uncertain, in part, because the community of legal persons contains a diverse array of individuals and collectives that are categorized in a variety of ways related to legal recognition.148  The community of persons and non-persons is so diverse that many groups of persons, like human beings, may have more in common with non-persons, like animals, than they do with other legally recognized persons, like corporations.  For this reason, the community of persons is an analytic unity that contains multitudes.  However, the diversity and multiplicity contained in the community of legal persons recognized by the state can be analytically contained and clarified by examining the status of those legal entities, individuals and collectives that are located at the margins of legal personhood.  The substance of legal personhood is constituted, in part, by determining who is not a person or who does not have access to the fullest realization of rights, privileges, and entitlements in law.  This process of “othering” those entities, individuals and collectives as less than full persons or not persons plays a crucial role in determining not only where the borders of personhood lie but also which entities, individuals and collectives lie within them. The issues surrounding legal personhood concern not only the question of who counts as a full member of the legal community but also how we take   145. This process of holding individuals and entities accountable has been complicated, as the community of those subject to duties and obligations and holding rights, privileges and entitlements has changed.  See generally Walter Hyde Woodburn, The Prosecution and Punishment of Animals and Lifeless Things in the Middle Ages and Modern Times, 64 U. PA. L.

This question entails determining which entities, collectives and individuals are considered legal persons and which rights, privileges, entitlements, duties and obligations these persons have access to.  Furthermore, in some cases, the current contests of legal personhood involve expanding legal personhood for some while placing limits on the rights and privileges of others.  The legal recognition of persons can have legal and moral consequences for existing members of the community of persons.  If the legal recognition of personhood for some animals is expanded, for example, the property rights of those individuals and corporate entities who sell animals as commodities may be restricted.  In addition, recognizing certain domestic animals as members of the legal community may entail legal penalties for those who eat animals or enhanced criminal liabilities for those who abuse animals.  And because the concept of legal personhood has an ethical force, requiring us to reconsider who and what we regard as worthy of respect and consideration by law, an expansion of legal personhood for animals would have moral consequences beyond the realm of law.149  The current efforts to expand the legal personhood of fetuses, embryos and zygotes may similarly entail limitations on the rights and privileges of other persons, particularly women.  Women in the United States who currently enjoy limited constitutional protections for reproductive freedom150 may be unable to realize these reproductive freedoms if the legal rights, privileges, protections and entitlements of fetuses, embryos and zygotes are expanded.151 In the next section, I draw on scholarship in vulnerability studies to present one possible picture of what a theory of legal personhood would look like if it relied upon the body and human embodiment as its foundation.  The vulnerabilities of embodied human beings and the capabilities of the body could be used to provide a conceptual foundation for legal recognition and the distribution of rights, privileges and entitlements to a variety of non-persons, such as animals,152 and persons without rights, such as undocumented persons.  Drawing on the insights of vulnerability studies, I construct a conceptual experiment in articulating a tentative framework for a feminist theory of the person.   149. Potentially, the legal expansion of personhood for animals might entail some reconceptualization of religious dogma, including an expansion of which types of sentient beings we must take account of in our spiritual journey.  150.

TOWARD AN EMBODIED LEGAL PERSONHOOD When you get the dragon out of his cave on to the plain and in the daylight, you can count his teeth and claws, and see just what is his strength. But to get him out is only the first step. The next is either to kill him, or to tame him and make him a useful animal.153  If our current conceptions of legal personhood have led to court challenges, political dissent and legislative action – as the current controversies around animals, corporations and fetuses might imply – perhaps scholars and judges should reconsider how the boundaries of the community of persons should be determined. It is time for a change regarding who counts and how we take account of them.  This section sketches one possibility for change.  In a framework that starts from the body and embodiment, human beings, defined in part by the limitations of the body and their embodied vulnerability, serve as the paradigmatic class of persons for the purpose of determining legal personhood.  As a starting point, a feminist theory of the person should ground its insights in theoretical paradigms that emphasize the shared vulnerability of human bodies and precarious possibilities embedded in embodiment.  This section will use the insights of vulnerability studies and its perspective on the body and embodiment to provide the foundation for a re-conceptualization of legal personhood that takes the vulnerability of bodies and vulnerable embodiment as a starting place for thinking about what and who is entitled to legal recognition as a person.  This framework seeks to answer the question: What would legal personhood look like if the body and embodiment were its foundation? The body, and the vulnerability of embodied individuals, plays an important role in this section’s effort to reconstruct legal personhood.  Relying in large part on the insights of the feminist theory of the body,154  legal scholars have argued for increased recognition of the importance of bodies and embodiment by the meaning of legal personhood.  In the late 1990’s the body enjoyed particular theoretical attention in legal scholarship.155  Since these earlier articulations, the body and embodiment have provided a critical lens for scholars to think about legal problems.156  These scholars have shown, however, that   153.

Feminist theory of the body, also called embodiment theory, focuses on questions of the construction of the self and various aspects of modernity in order to expose dualist anti-somatic perspectives and to denaturalize cohesive conceptions of a natural “pre-cultural” body.

The body is not an objective pre-cultural representation of the “natural.”157  Instead, it is, like the concept of the person itself, culturally constructed and historically contextual.158  Our understanding of what the body is and how it interacts with the world emerges in part from the cultural conceptions that shape our perception of the world.159  The body has been constructed by culture in relation to such diverse fields as science,160 medicine,161 law162 and the nation state.163  In spite of these limitations, an effort to start from the body and re-conceptualize personhood around embodied vulnerabilities and capacities as the foundation for legal personhood provides a decidedly different take on the question of how we define and conceptualize who counts and how we should take account of them.  The purpose of this discussion of the body and embodiment is not meant to endorse a universal essentialist conception of the body in an ahistorical fashion.  For this reason, the analytic framework described in this section should be understood as an experiment with one conception of the body and embodiment that may provide a productive way of structuring legal personhood.  There could be competing conceptions that create different outcomes. In the legal imagination, the body and embodiment serve an important explanatory role.  Law is often described as a body164 or as a Corpus Juris.165  This use of the body as a metaphor, however, is not merely a poetic tactic.  Instead, it serves to explain and organize various doctrines, rules, standards, cases and statutes into a unit.166  This metaphorical description of the law as a single body  foundation for human rights).  157.

Pound even explained that “[i]f the rules are the bone and sinew of the legal order, the technique is its life blood and the ideals are its brains.” Id. at 486. Matambanadzo Pagination Proof (Do Not Delete) 1/31/2013  2:56 PM  EMBODYING VULNERABILITY 73 preserves the intellectual, moral, social and philosophical cohesiveness of law, rendering sometimes contradictory applications and articulations into conceptual completeness.  Legal professionals are taught from their earliest days to think of the philosophical jurisprudential concerns of constitutional law as part of the same cohesive unit as criminal law, tax law, bankruptcy law, corporate law, real estate law, tort law, property law, contract law, administrative law and various other discrete areas.  This metaphor of the body forges a picture of a collective entity (a collection of disparate rules, cases, treatises, codes, customs and statutes in various jurisdictions), which functions (or dysfunctions) in concert as a unity (“the law”).  The notion that the law is a body places legal rules in a mythical category, invoking the natural and political bodies of the sovereign king, the body politic and even the mystical body of Christ.167  The metaphor of the body also serves a practical purpose.  The body is accessible.  Individual human beings have intimate experiential knowledge of their own bodies.  This experiential knowledge of one’s own body provides some semblance of a foundation for understanding the ways in which law works.  One might believe, “If law is like a body, then perhaps it is like my body.  Perhaps I can understand it – or at least learn to live within it and use it for my ends.” The body is also an essential descriptive aspect of legal personhood.168  It provides a critical foundation from which to think about the problem of legal personhood.  Although it may not “explain or justify” legal decisions,169 it serves an important expressive purpose, describing implicit attributes of legal persons and indicating what sorts of creatures law makers feel a legal person should be.  Non-human entities, individuals or collectives that do not possess a recognizable physical body must be rendered conceptually corporeal and embodied through the use of the body as a metaphor in order to be recognized as persons.170  Naming an individual, collective or entity as a body links it to personhood in a way that makes it easier to recognize as a member of the legal community.  The body and embodiment, in this way, is a foundation for humanizing the inhuman   167. See generally ERNST H. KANTOROWICZ, THE KING’S TWO BODIES (1997) (examining the embodied dualism of the king as human being and the king as a representative of his office). Law has often been idealized as a sort of secular religion, enabling citizens to discern a sense of justice and right even in the shadow of competing conceptions of the good. See JOHN RAWLS, A THEORY OF JUSTICE (1971).  It even has its own robes and initiations into legal mysteries related to thinking like a lawyer. Bradley C.

The body is not a “mere” metaphor but plays an important role in defining not only the field of law, but as we will see, the substance of legal personhood.171  In this way, the body consistently serves as an important reference point in law for understanding the boundaries of the community of persons. Scholars working in vulnerability studies, informed by feminist legal theory, human rights discourses, political theory and embodiment theory, have made the claim that vulnerability is a universal constant for human beings.172  Grounding their insights in the notion of the vulnerable embodied human being, they have argued for a legal regime that places embodied vulnerability at the center of legal subjectivity and takes account of the realities of dependency that arise from embodied vulnerability.173  Taking on the underlying assumptions of the equality norms in legal theory, vulnerability studies pursues its scholarly interventions by starting from the recognition that human beings are inherently characterized by a universal and constant vulnerability that arises from human bodies and embodied pain, pleasure and need.174  Vulnerability studies scholars strive to reorganize the relationship between individuals and the state by anchoring access to legal, economic and social entitlements, rights and privileges to the human condition of embodied vulnerability.175 Vulnerability, according to many, is a condition which emerges in part from embodied human needs and in part from the destabilizing forces of globalization, forces that upend traditional support systems and coping mechanisms.176 The origin of vulnerability studies has been intertwined with international human rights laws and analyses of the economic and social impact of globalization.177  Peadar Kirby has argued that globalization has led to increases in vulnerability and violence that have fundamentally altered the well-being of individuals and society as a whole.178  Vulnerability, according to Kirby, adequately describes “the impact of globalization on our personal and social lives,”179 because it highlights the ways in which social and economic risks, challenges and changes have become complex and multifaceted in their causes, interactions and effects.180  The United Nations Department of Economic and   171.

It is important to note that for Kirby the concept of vulnerability also entails an engagement with coping mechanisms and with violence – violence that arises from coping with vulnerabilities and violence that causes vulnerabilities.  This relationship between violence and vulnerability highlights the fact that traditional coping mechanisms like social support networks, seemingly stable climate and weather patterns, and state social welfare systems which enhanced peoples’ abilities to cope and survive have been upended by the changes of globalization.

For Butler, human beings are constituted as political subjects in part by the social vulnerability of the body.  Starting from the vulnerability of the body acknowledges that we are corporeal creatures who are subject not only to dangers from our environment but also to sickness, illness and accidents.183  But the loss and grief arising from death, illness and the vulnerability of the body does not rest on a framework of isolated individualism.  Instead a perspective that starts from vulnerability recognizes the interconnected, reciprocal nature of human existence and the constant potential for dependency during the human life cycle.184  Vulnerability studies—through its use of embodiment and the body as a starting point for political structures, ethical obligations and legal rules—contains some particular intuitions that may be helpful in thinking about the pending personhood battles in the United States.  The following intuitions underlying vulnerability studies may be helpful:  Persons are characterized both as individuals and by their connection to others. Persons possess a human body. They are characterized by embodiment, have been born and have been gestated in the body of another member of their species. Persons are potentially mothers and always the children of mothers. Persons are sentient creatures that spend some time in their lives with self-awareness. Persons possess present potential for individual existence and present potential for collective associations. Persons’ bodies are characterized not only by needs and appetites, but also by the limits of sickness, illness and death. Persons are demonstrably capable of pain and suffering and also  capacities ambivalently (through his discussion of violence) avoids some aspects of essentializing that trap the legal deployment of the vulnerable subject.  181.

These general principles help to develop a presumption of personhood for vulnerable embodied individuals and a set of nine responsive non-hierarchical factors to be used in determinations about legal personhood.  Adopting a presumption of personhood is one possible way to begin addressing the challenges of legal personhood in a way that consciously embraces the body and embodiment as its foundation.  This presumption of personhood would be granted to embodied individuals, entities or collectives as recognition that their bodies, and the vulnerabilities and capabilities of their bodies, render them part of the same community as human beings.  A presumption of personhood could be accorded to all those entities, individuals or collectives whose existence mirrors prima facie that of a human being in terms of body and embodiment.  In threshold disputes concerning the recognition of novel classes of legal persons or the expansion of legal rights, privileges and entitlements for currently recognized persons, those individuals and entities whose existence mirrors that of an embodied human being should be treated to a presumption of legal recognition for the rights, privileges, entitlements, obligations and duties of personhood that accords them at least the status of quasi-personhood.  Those entities, individuals and collectives that are not similar to human beings in terms of embodied capacities and vulnerabilities should have the burden of proving that they resemble bodies and are similarly situated to embodied human beings.185  A presumption of personhood could be augmented by a nine-factor analytic framework, gleaned from the intuitive potentials, vulnerabilities and capabilities of the human body that would serve to take account of the body and embodiment.  This framework has the potential to create a more substantive framework for dealing with the diversity of legal individuals, entities and collective, and balancing their various and conflicting interests in law.  While these factors may be articulated in diverse ways, one possible articulation is as follows:  Embodied “Natural” in so far as it is born of another member of its species Vulnerable to death, illness, injury and need arising from embodiment Capable of pain and suffering Capable of pleasure and joy Capable of volition   185. Many scholars may find the human-centered nature of this framework problematic for the ways in which it naturalizes the privileges of personhood for human beings while potentially marginalizing non-human animals currently not included in the community of persons.  There are ways to alleviate this challenge. E.g., Bryant, supra note 83, at 329–30 (arguing that advocacy employing arguments for direct standing for animals may be useful for decentering human beings). This central presumption, however, is designed in part to de-center human beings by placing them in relation to other individuals and entities.  By placing non-human animals with human beings in a constellation of individuals and entities worthy of legal rights and recognition as persons, it is my intention to recognize and expand the community of legal subjects to include animals.

These factors could be deployed in a subjective and responsive way that allows for interpretation, or in a more objective and rigid way that creates clear standards for determinations of legal personhood.  For example, those individuals, entities and collectives lacking two or fewer factors of embodied human existence would be accorded quasi-personhood status, guaranteeing most of the rights, privileges and entitlements of personhood.  Those individuals, collectives or entities lacking between three and five of the factors could be accorded the status of quasi-personhood with some rights, privileges and entitlements of personhood but not all.  And finally, those individuals, entities and collectives whose existence strays far from that of embodied human beings and does not display the sorts of vulnerability and the types of potential that arise from the body, will be non-persons.  They could be granted capacities, protections and entitlements as a matter of privilege and not as a matter of right.  And if they seek capacities, protections and entitlements as a matter of right, these disputes would be adjudicated without the presumption of personhood.  This analytic framework restructures our legal conception of personhood in a way that centers on human embodiment and the body consciously and could be used to structure a legal personhood that recognizes the relationship between and among persons and non-persons.187  According to scholars like Tom Regan, the relationship between embodiment and legal status may yield a productive expansion of animal rights if one adopts a non-anthropomorphic perspective. 188  If the body matters and “if it turns out that what is done to the bodies of (at least) some nonhuman animals matters morally, then it may be that these animals . . . should have legal rights to the integrity and protection of their bodies.”189  A conception of legal personhood that privileges embodiment and vulnerability, for this reason, may provide a foundational justification for some non-human animals to claim space and gain recognition as legal persons. A presumption of personhood accorded only to embodied individuals and entities whose existence mirrors that of an embodied human being might create uncertainties about the legal status of embodied non-persons and disembodied juridical persons.  These uncertainties are not inevitable or destabilizing. States and legislatures may choose to distribute some recognition to legal entities and   186. See infra Figure 1.  187.

Personhood is not a totalizing all or nothing status.  Individuals and entities need not be recognized as persons in order to possess legal rights and privileges.190  And individuals recognized as persons have not always been accorded all of the legal recognition, rights and privileges typically associated with personhood.191  For example, the current capacities of corporations to own property, make contracts and act under law could be guaranteed by the state charters that sanction their creation and the state laws that create them without recognizing these entities as legal persons.  These rights may be accorded to collectives serving legitimate ends without according these collectives unequivocal recognition as legal persons.  Strengthening personhood from a foundation that builds upon embodied vulnerability and the human body also might limit the expansion of special privileges for corporations in the constitutional context, sending an important normative message about which entities and individuals are part of the community of democratic participants, and which are created and designed as a means to serve the ends of individuals in that community.  For this reason, these uncertainties could have some positive consequences.  Juridical entities might participate in the democratic process more cautiously and less ruthlessly if their speech rights were deemed a matter of privilege and not a right, subject to the democratic impulses of human beings.  Those who own and operate juridical entities like corporations and limited liability companies might take greater care in training and monitoring employees if their privacy interests and search and seizure protections were not constitutionally guaranteed. While such a scheme would be radically different in some respects, it would retain many aspects of the status quo.  For example, in dealing with the challenges arising from those who advocate for legal personhood for embryos and fetuses, legal frameworks could retain existing privacy protections while leaving the door open for potential expansions of personhood that might be necessary in light of technological advances that would facilitate sustained life and birth outside of an individual woman’s womb.  All individual human beings that have been born would still universally enjoy access to legal personhood.  However, human tissue, without further technological advances, including fetuses and embryos, would remain outside of the community of quasi-legal persons because they have not been born and lack the present potential for individual existence and collective association.  Fetuses and embryos, through argument and proof, may still be accorded the status of quasi-persons in some limited contexts, but they would not enjoy a presumption of personhood which would serve as the foundation for their membership in the legal community.192     190. See supra pp. 48–52 (discussing how rights, privileges and immunities were differentially afforded to women, despite the recognition that they were persons).  191. Id.  192. The potential for full human life that embryos and fetuses possess does not necessarily mean they are similarly situated to born human beings in terms of embodiment.  But see Charles I. Lugosi, Conforming to the Rule of Law: When Person and Human Being Finally Mean the Same Thing in Fourteenth Amendment Jurisprudence, 22 ISSUES L. & MED. 119, 127 (2006/2007).

Adopting a presumption of personhood for embodied individuals would disrupt the status quo in some positive ways.  A presumption of personhood for embodied entities grounded in the human body and a flexible nine-factor framework would shift the current conceptualization of personhood in ways that center on the body and embodiment to provide some additional recognition for animals.  Furthermore, the presumption of quasi-personhood for individual embodied and disembodied entities may accord animals more legal recognition under law, perhaps even rendering the enforcement of laws related to animal welfare more enforceable.193   Because access to legal personhood is often regarded as a pre-requisite for legal rights and capacities, including the right to sue and be sued, some scholars regard personhood as a foundational necessity for any meaningful shift in the legal status of animals.194  It would also have the potential to justify the complex ways in which human tissue and unborn human beings are treated under law.195 Furthermore, a presumption of personhood for embodied individuals that starts from the human body and embodiment also has the potential to push the current legal status quo, which privileges corporate persons,196 in order to better meet human need.197  Finally, a presumption of personhood for embodied individuals  presumed by law and philosophy. See, e.g., Robin West, The Difference in Women’s Hedonic Lives: A Phenomenological Critique of Feminist Legal Theory, 15 WIS. WOMEN’S L.J. 149, 151 (2000) (arguing how the biological nature of reproduction, child rearing and sexuality for women undermines the myth of the impermeable liberal individual). The privileging of the individual as an ideal self in law also fails to account for the important role that collectives play in society and in law. See Meir Dan-Cohen, Between Selves and Collectivities: Toward a Jurisprudence of Identity, 61 U. CHI. L. REV. 1213, 1217–18 (1994) (arguing that methodological paradigms that privilege individualism or collectivism are reductive in nature).  Fetuses and embryos do not constitute a separate individual being apart from the women who carry them and are completely dependent upon their carriers for support and care.  See generally Judith Jarvis Thomson, A Defense of Abortion, 1 PHIL. & PUB. AFFAIRS 47 (1971) (comparing the moral dilemma arising from an unintended and unwanted pregnancy to a scenario where an individual is hooked up to a terminally ill violinist without her consent).  193.  Some authors have argued that personhood is not necessary to enhance the legal protections of animals.  Taimie Bryant, for example, argues that advocacy for animals may employ a strategy that attempts to establish duties toward animals and leaves the question of personhood for animals out of the equation.

Wise, Legal Personhood and the Nonhuman Rights Project, 17 ANIMAL L. 1, 2–5 (2010) (declaring the goal of the Nonhuman Rights Project to be a declaration by a United States state court that animals are legal persons); but see Bryant, supra note 83, at 252–53 (arguing that pursuing personhood is not fruitful because no theory of legal personhood provides a guaranteed roadmap to alter the status quo of animal cruelty and human inflicted injury).  195.  See supra pp. 57–61 (discussing the complexities of legal recognition for fetuses and embryos).  196.  See Marc Galanter, Planet of the APs: Reflections on the Scale of Law and its Users, 53 BUFF. L. REV. 1369, 1369–87 (2006) (noting that corporations “occupy” a significant deal of legal space and consume a large share of legal resources including attorneys and judicial resources).  197.  While human need is not the first priority of law, some default legal rules can be altered or disregarded in order to meet human need.  See Laura S. Underkuffler, The Politics of Property and Need, Matambanadzo Pagination Proof (Do Not Delete) 1/31/2013  2:56 PM 80 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 20:45 2012  and entities—and not for others—taps into important shared intuitions about community and justice, and about who counts and how we should take account of them. Admittedly at the core of this reliance on the body and embodiment for entities lies a normative judgment that human beings are the reference point for legal personhood.  Although this is a subjective value judgment,198 it is one subjective value judgment among many.  In the current state of legal personhood in most U.S. based jurisdictions, law makers and judges employ individual implicit or unspoken value judgments, many of them quite subjective, about the value of life and the community of persons all the time.  This presumption of personhood with its analytic framework for embodiment presents the possibility of one subjective paradigm for personhood grounded by embodied vulnerability and the vulnerability of the body, and guided by intuitions about what it means to be a person.  A subjective normative perspective that embraces the body and embodiment in a clear and explicit way acknowledges the stakes and the foundations for legal personhood, and takes account of the human being as paradigmatic person in a way that matters and has real consequences. While there might be administrative costs that arise from adopting a presumption of personhood for embodied individuals, such a presumption has the potential to foster a legal framework that is more capable of dealing with the technological and social diversity of human, animal and juridical subjects that might challenge the limits of personhood.  The challenges arising from the vested interests of property and capital and their accompanying uncertainties are not necessarily grounds for ignoring the positive possibilities presented by an embodied conception of the person.  Similar arguments about vested interests, uncertainty and instability were made about the costs of admitting women and African Americans to the community of full legal persons.  And previously, rights for African Americans as full legal persons and citizens were unthinkable in law.199  What was unthinkable before, however, now seems inevitable and  20 CORNELL J.L. & PUB. POL’Y 363, 368–72 (2010) (examining how the need to sustain life is sometimes recognized as a justification for altering the default rules protecting private property).  198.  This analytic framework is not the only paradigm designed to take human beings as the reference point for legal community.  The concept of human dignity that lies at the center of human rights law also starts from a human centered perspective.  Like the concept of human dignity, which has the potential to place important limits on who counts and how they count in law, a concept of personhood that centers human beings through the paradigm of the body and embodiment might be useful for addressing the complications of expanding and contracting legal personhood. Like the concept of human dignity, however, an analytic framework that starts with the human body could be problematic because it perpetuates a perspective on personhood that is speciesist in nature. See SINGER, supra note 95, at 7 (defining specieism as “a prejudice or attitude of bias toward the interests of members of one’s own species and against those of members of another species”). The assumption of the primacy of human beings as legal and ethical subjects privileges particular human centered intuitions, arising from western metaphysical religious dogmas that may undermine the values that an expansion of legal personhood strives to make.  See Bryant, supra note 83, at 268.  199.  The “unthinkable” nature of legal rights for excluded groups often seems unthinkable.  See Stone, supra note 99, at 453 (discussing how rights for African Americans were previously unthinkable under the status quo).  According to Christopher Stone, shifts in the status quo concerning the community of rights holders seem unnatural and intractable.  Stone notes, “[t]hroughout legal history, each successive extension of rights to some new entity has been, theretofore, a bit unthinkable.

In the end, justice and equity trumped the uncertainties arising from the elimination of coverture, slavery and segregation.  Justice and equity should prevail here, ensuring that legal persons are only accorded the fullest array of legal benefits if they are similarly situated in terms of embodiment and their bodies to human beings. IV. CONCLUSION The law, along with other institutional structures, creates a nomos, or a socially constructed normative universe.200  The nomos of law influences behavior by simultaneously enacting social controls and spaces of resistance through discourse and mythology.201  The nomos of law can have far reaching influence – structuring the contours of our social, cultural and political institutions.  For this reason, this article ends where it started: with the notion that law is a site of political, economic, social and personal struggle where varied interests play out in competition for a legal ruling that vindicates their claims.  Much of this struggle occurs in the realm of theoretical normative conceptions where articulations are given effect through legal endorsement.  The recognition of one individual as a person renders the individual in question a member of the legal community.  Law, like other powerful cultural institutions, has the power not only to regulate culture but to limit possibilities by imposing a narrow understanding of the intelligibility of persons, i.e. who counts and how we take account of them.  It also has persuasive powers to generate new spaces for resistance and recognition for persons that have been previously ignored. This article has provided one attempt to deal with the complexities of the personhood struggle in law.  It provides one possibility for re-imagining legal personhood from a perspective that takes account of the body and embodiment.  It is not meant to provide a totalizing theory but to begin a conversation that starts with the vulnerabilities of the body as an alternative foundation for thinking about how the rights, privileges and entitlements of legal personhood should be expanded for some and perhaps limited for others. The borders of legal personhood continually emerge and re-emerge in response to advances in technology, science and industry.  Because the meaning of legal personhood can change and shift across time and in response to circumstances, legal personhood is empty of meaning and can be filled with content in response to the needs of those individuals, entities and collectives that seek it.  Legal personhood, however, is also full of potential and promise, harnessing the moral force that comes with the recognition of law.  This is the paradox of meaning that legal personhood entails.  The meaning of legal personhood can be empty of content, capable of being construed in multiple ways, and yet it can be full of moral force, providing a platform for accessing rights, privileges and entitlements and creating the foundation for arising obligations and duties.   decree of Nature, not a legal convention acting in support of some status quo.” Id.  200.
