Hodges,1 like the Ohio State Law Journal’s decision to proceed with it, was forged in the light of what was, for many—though assuredly not all—a moment of triumphant constitutional promise. The Supreme Court’s announcement in Obergefell of a constitutional right to marriage equality, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses,2 effectively declared the end of legal discrimination against same-sex sexuality, intimacy, and love in the marriage setting. This liberty, this equality, Obergefell trumpeted, manifested the deep values of the American people. And not only deep but also enduring: The vote in the case may have been close, but Justice Anthony Kennedy’s majority opinion for the Court presented itself as written with an eye to history.3 By its own terms, Obergefell is meant to be a fixed feature of the constitutional firmament, to endure for the ages, just as marriage itself has, in a certain sense, from time out of memory. Despite some notable flashpoints of early legal resistance to the Supreme Court’s Obergefell ruling,4 lower courts and other legal actors at the federal and state levels have faithfully understood the decision’s constitutional teaching, finding it easy to appreciate how far-reaching Obergefell, by its own compass, is. In addition to announcing a nationwide marriage equality rule, this decision’s deeper logic indicates the Constitution’s commitment to liberty and equality in marriage and family law generally, while also pointing a way forward for other aspects of law-governed social life. Given the present organization of the pro-LGBTQ rights movements, it came as no great surprise when, on the heels of Obergefell, the Supreme Court agreed to take a case in which Obergefell’s constitutional reach could be extended as a matter of federal anti-discrimination law, effectively applying Obergefell’s liberal                                                                                                                        Copyright © 2016 by Marc Spindelman.

In this general setting, the question Obergefell has persistently raised is a reframed version of a question that Chief Justice Roberts’s dissent sharply asks.6 What sounds dissonant in the dissent’s formulation has been for others a harmonious wonder: What other old ways of life, of living, of being, and, of course, of discriminating, might yield to the principles of liberty and equality that Obergefell holds the Constitution to embrace? What liberty, what equality, and in what new settings, operating in what new ways, might follow with time from this case? Whatever Obergefell might come to mean in the shorter or longer term, the majority opinion and the liberal values it reflects have for some time now, since the announcement of the decision, seemed axiomatic, beyond reasonable question, hence secure, as the decision intends itself to be. So much has this been the case, anyway, that efforts engaging Obergefell in the direction of fortifying the ruling may have seemed, substance aside, practically unnecessary, more, on a certain level, for the historical record than anything else. Friendly academic critiques of the decision that have been circulated and published—suggesting, at times, that Obergefell is, if anything, too conservative a ruling—have invariably taken it for granted that Obergefell’s insistence that discrimination against lesbians and gay men and same-sex intimacies, including in marriage, is state-based irrationality that has no proper place in our constitutional tradition and system.7 Obergefell’s status as a new but fixed part of the American way of life has been affirmed by, among others, those who have exercised in the most concrete of ways the constitutional liberty and equality that the decision guarantees. By late June 2016, just shy of a year after Obergefell was handed down, Gallup reported that the number of adults in same-sex marriages in the                                                                                                                       5 Gloucester Cty.

Hodges decision, with increases apparent among those living in states where same-sex marriage was already legal as well as those where it was not.”9 With the passage of time, the present numbers of same-sex marriages are assuredly north of these figures, with federal and state governments having conformed their marriage and family law rules and practices to square with Obergefell’s constitutional demands. To say this is not in any way to forget how Obergefell has altered the course of the lives of those inside the LGBTQ communities who are in relationships and those who are not, as it has expanded the meaning of marriage in the United States. If, in important respects, it now seems impossible to put the genie of same-sex marriage entirely back in the bottle, it is in no small part because, like LGBTQ communities, the balance of the American people have responded to the broad understanding of the right to marry affirmed by Obergefell with high levels of support nationwide. According to recent figures, a majority of Americans now steadily support same-sex marriage, with the highest levels of approval for it in the under-fifty and, in particular, the under-thirty crowd.10                                                                                                                       8 Jeffrey M.

Hodges heads to press shortly after the November 2016 election, Obergefell’s constitutional status has acquired a new punctuation mark behind it—a question mark that before the election it did not have.11 With public promises by President-elect Donald J. Trump to appoint Justices to the U.S. Supreme Court with pro-life commitments in the run-up to the election as well as after it, eyes have been insistently fixed on Roe v. Wade,12 as well as its progeny, notably Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey,13 which may well confront exacting pressures before too long.14 Of course, the originalist methods of constitutional interpretation that have in various settings been mobilized against Roe and its progeny also align with critical appraisals of Obergefell and its own constitutional methodological grounds. No one who has read Obergefell can miss how the opinions dissenting from the Court’s ruling in the case variously expressed the view that this new marriage decision is not supported by the Constitution itself, which would thus, as the dissents variously map out, leave the question of marriage equality to the democratic political processes.15                                                                                                                      Piacenza, Attitudes on Same-Sex Marriage in Every State, PRRI (Apr. 20, 2015), http://www.prri.org/spotlight/map-every-states-opinion-on-same-sex-marriage/ [https://per ma.cc/4444-QT5R].  11 See, e.g., Liam Stack, Trump Victory Alarms Gay and Transgender Groups, N.Y.

With the question mark behind Obergefell having been added, however, it is possible that its contours could be filled in. Asked about marriage equality on Fox News Sunday in January 2016, then-candidate for the Republican Party nomination for President, Donald J. Trump, questioned Obergefell:  If I’m . . . elected, I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things. . . . .  . . . I wish that it was done by the state. I don’t like the way they ruled. I disagree with the Supreme Court . . . it should be a states’ rights issue. . . .  This is a very surprising ruling. . . . I can see changes coming down the line, frankly.17 When pressed “to button this up,” “[S]ir, are you saying that if you become [P]resident, you might try to appoint [J]ustices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage?,” the reply that was returned was: “I would strongly consider that, yes.”18  Perhaps more significantly, and perhaps indicating what consideration of this issue has yielded with time for reflection, in his first major national television interview after the November election, President-elect Trump told 60 Minutes’ Leslie Stahl, when she brought the topic up, that he has been a “supporter” of the LGBTQ community, and mentioned LGBTQ people at the Republican National Convention, even going so far as to note the positive responses that the move garnered.19 When asked directly whether he was a supporter of marriage equality, too, he replied: “[I]t’s irrelevant because it was already settled. It’s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it’s done. . . . It’s done. . . . [T]hese cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They’ve been settled. And, I’m fine with that.”20                                                                                                                       16 Id. at 2623–24.  17 Fox News Sunday: Ted Cruz Attacks Donald Trump’s Financial Record; Trump Responds (Fox television broadcast Jan. 31, 2016) (transcript available at http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/01/31/ted-cruz-attacks-donald-trump-financial-re cord-trump-responds/ [https://perma.cc/E74U-6JVX]) (remarks of Donald J.

It is easy to imagine that the contributions will take on resonances and shades of meaning that may not have been intended for them at the time they were originally produced. Some of the conceptual bids that they make may already seem different than they did just a short time ago, although none is at this moment close to any expiration date. In any case, while the contributions are available to be read in the light of complex and still-unfolding, large-scale cultural and legal contests over social meaning—not only of liberty and equality but also of marriage, gender, and sexual orientation difference, and the boundaries of private and public life, among other things—they might most generously be read for perspectives and insights they offer from a certain moment in time. The modes of experience and thinking that imbue the works with their energies may shift with events that are developing, but glimpses of them may not yet slip entirely out of reach for a spell at least, if ever. To the extent that the contributions to this Colloquium imagine not only conditions of a present but also of futures that Obergefell has seemed to open up, perspectives on these horizons will be preserved in these pages—in writing, in thoughts, in hopes—suspended in amber across space and time. Whatever happens with Obergefell itself as a matter of constitutional doctrine, as a constitutional promise and as a lived reality, it will endure one way or another. What follows next are the contributions that actually make up the Colloquium, which begins with a contribution by Justice John Paul Stevens (Ret.) offering “two thoughts” about Obergefell.21 After that are articles written by Professors Susan Appleton,22 Suzanne Kim,23 Jane Schacter,24 and yours truly.25 Immense thanks are due to all the contributors to the Colloquium for all their efforts, as well as to those who helped them in them.
