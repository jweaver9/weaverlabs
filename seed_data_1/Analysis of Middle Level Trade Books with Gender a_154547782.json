One way schools can reduce bullying and increase successful learning environments is to include trade books that feature gender and sexual minorities. State and national standards set expectations for social and emotional learning as well as critical analysis of high quality reading materials. This research analyzed trade books from the 2013 and 2014 Rainbow Lists which were chosen by the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Trans gender Round Table of the American Library Association as the best books published with LGBTQ content the previous year for readers under the age of 18. Forty-seven books at the fourth through ninth grade levels were coded for genre, character identity, role, portrayal, reading levels, Cass (1979) Stages, bullying events, profanity, and sexual content. Profanity and sexual content were coded to anticipate community objections. Suggestions for the use of specific books in classroom situations are discussed. Keywords: LGBTQ, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, fiction, nonfiction, bullying ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT Acknowledgements Thank you, Dr. Bickford, Dr. Reven, Dr. Kory, and Dr. Moyer for answering every question and sharing your expertise with me. Your generous help and guidance allowed me to complete this project with enthusiasm. 3 ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 4 Table of Contents Analysis of Middle Level Trade Books with Gender and Sexual

In spite of efforts to welcome diversity in American public schools, members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (hereafter, LGBTQ) community continue to be underrepresented in the curriculum (Kosciw, Greytak, Palmer, & Boesen, 2014, p. 96). California is the only state in the nation to require inclusive curriculum (California Board of Education, n.d.) while eight states have laws that prohibit a positive representation of gender and sexual minorities in schools. The so-called \"no promo homo\" states are Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah (Lambda Legal, n.d.). Between these extremes, many states and local areas have antidiscrimination laws and anti-bullying measures that might allow for reading materials, instruction, and class discussions about gender and sexual minorities and the issues they face. The Human Rights Campaign publishes an interactive map that summarizes various legal issues, including anti-bullying and anti-discrimination laws for all fifty states (Human Rights Campaign, 2016). Literature Review If teachers wish to include information about members of the LGBTQ community in their classrooms, what materials are available and how do they justify their choices to the administration and the community? In this study, I addressed these questions by reading fiction and nonfiction books written for middle level readers. As I read, I took note of how gender and sexual minority characters were portrayed, what happened to them, and how their stories could be used to help students understand themselves and others. I also recorded potentially ban-worthy content like profanity and sexuality to help inform an educator's choices. I also took note of bullying with the intension of ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT highlighting books that would spark discussion on justice, fairness, and compassion. In the end, I hope this research will be used as a tool to help teachers and parents find just the right books for their unique situations. Educational Psychology of Adolescence Middle school is a time of transition for students. Boys and girls are entering adolescence and experiencing new and confusing physical changes. Students are also changing cognitively and emotionally. Educational psychologists have viewed adolescence as a time of moving from Jean Piaget's (1977) concrete operational stage to the formal operational stage. Piaget observed that the cognitive processes of children in the early elementary grades were linear and based on cause and effect. As they matured and entered the formal operational stage around age twelve, they began to have a greater capacity for abstract thinking and the making of moral judgments. Giedd, et al. (1999) demonstrated that adolescent brains are in a period of growth and change, but it is a slow process that continues for many years. Erik Erickson's (1968) theory of psycho/social development focused on another aspect of adolescence. He described individuals (ages 12-18) as facing Identity versus Role Confusion. In this stage students seek to define themselves, discover how they fit into society and envision a future for themselves. 8 Middle school teachers have the important task of helping students through the cognitive, social/emotional and physical changes of adolescence. The middle school model was created with this in mind and is composed of the following characteristics: team teaching, interdisciplinary teaching, advisory programs and exploratory curriculum. Team teaching allows for several teachers to focus on a small group of students across the content areas. Interdisciplinary teaching encourages common content to be explored ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 9 through the lens of various subject areas. Advisory programs place students in small groups with one adult for the purpose of focusing on the social and emotional aspects of learning. Exploratory programs allow students to try new things and develop talents like acting, music or art. The Association for Middle Level Education (2010) has clearly stated that the most effective middle school environment, the one that creates overall academic success, is the one that deals with cognitive as well as social and emotional growth in students. The Illinois State Board of Education, in coherence with guidance from The Association for Middle Level Education, has established Social/Emotional Learning Standards with these three goals: Goal 1: Develop self-awareness and self-management skills to achieve school and life success. Goal 2: Use social-awareness and interpersonal skills to establish and maintain positive relationships. Goal 3: Demonstrate decision-making skills and responsible behaviors in personal, school, and community contexts. (Gordon, Ji, Mulhall, Shaw, & Weissberg, 2011, p. 73) The stages of adolescent development, descriptions of ideal learning environments, and statements of learning goals are necessary for planning middle level education, and teachers have the difficult job of translating these ideals into meaningful learning opportunities for their specific students. In turn, students in minority populations face unique and often little-understood obstacles to their success in the classroom. One such population includes members of the LGBTQ community. These individuals identify on the spectrum of sexual orientation and/or gender identity in areas ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 10 that are considered different from heterosexuality. Unfortunately, information about gender and sexual minorities is generally absent from middle school curriculum. Only 9.5% of middle school students reported any inclusion of the LGBTQ community in their textbooks or assigned readings (Kosciw et al., 2014, p. 96). As students enter puberty and their sexual attractions become more obvious to themselves, many confront heteronormativity, the idea that heterosexuality is the only normal and accepted sexual identity (Green & Peterson, 2006). Gender and sexual minority students in this environment often face discrimination and bullying. In fact, according to the 2013 National School Climate Survey (2014), 30.3% of LGBTQ students who took the survey admitted to missing one day of school in the previous month because of the fear of bullying and over 10% missed more than four days (Kosciw et al., 2014, p. xvi). The American Psychological Association (2008) reports the following: The widespread prejudice, discrimination, and violence to which lesbians and gay men are often subjected are significant mental health concerns. Sexual prejudice, sexual orientation discrimination and antigay violence are major sources of stress for lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Although social support is crucial in coping with stress, antigay attitudes and discrimination may make it difficult for lesbian, gay and bisexual people to find such support. (pp. 2-3) Stress is an important factor in a child's ability to engage with the learning process and succeed in school. Brown and Knowles (2007) reported on various studies related to stress and learning, concluding that \"Anxiety and stress affect the quality of students' cognitive processing, disrupting their ability to process information efficiently\" ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT (p. 93). Just the Facts about Sexual Orientation and Youth (Just the Facts Coalition, 2008), a pamphlet produced by psychological and education organizations, concurred: 1 1  One result of the isolation and lack of support experienced by some lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth is higher rates of emotional distress, suicide attempts, and risky sexual behavior and substance use. Because their legitimate fear of being harassed or hurt may reduce the willingness of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths to ask for help, it is important that their school environments be open and accepting so these young people will feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and concerns, including the option of disclosing their sexual orientation to others. Such disclosure is an expression of a normal tendency to want to share personal information about oneself with important others and should be respected as such. (p. 4) The Cass ( 1979) model of homosexual identity formation is a helpful roadmap for gay and lesbian individuals. Understanding these stages might help educators nurture students toward a healthy self-concept. The first stage is Identity Confusion where the student considers the question, \"Could I be gay?\" and struggles with accepting, denying or rejecting that idea. This is a stage of potential inner turmoil. The second stage is Identity Comparison. The student considers the possibility of being gay or lesbian and what that means for the future. Here they might deal with fear, grief and social alienation. The third stage is Identity Tolerance where the student begins to believe he or she is probably gay or lesbian and seeks to find others. Stage Four is Identity Acceptance where the person begins to have a positive view of his or her sexual orientation and might choose to share this information with a select few. The fifth stage is Identity Pride in ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT which the student publically identifies with the LGBTQ community and creates separation from the heterosexual community. The last stage is Identity Synthesis when sexual identity becomes just one part of a complex sense of self. 12 Teachers who want to help their gender and sexual minority students navigate the complexities of adolescence and encourage a healthy identity find little, if any, acknowledgement of their existence in the curriculum (Kosciw et al., 2014, p. 96). One way to deal with the silence on this topic is to provide teachers with resources that allow them to incorporate non-textbook publications into their advisory classes, English classes, and social studies classes. The most useful resources will help the teacher not only meet the social and emotional needs of students but also meet the requirements of the Common Core State Standards, resources that are of high quality, promote critical thinking and give opportunities for analysis (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers [NGA Center & CCSSO], 2010). Curricular Inclusion of Gender and Sexual Minorities In light of the fact that gender and sexual minorities are underrepresented in middle school curriculum readings (Kosciw et al. , 2014, p. xix) and teachers need high quality, appropriate books for their students, this research analyzed the content of middle level trade books with LGBTQ content. The authoritative work on this topic is The Heart Has Its Reasons, Young Adult Literature with Gay/Lesbian/Queer Content, 1969-2004 by Michael Cart and Christine A. Jenkins (2006). Referencing Jenkins's (1998) content analysis, they described the portrayals of LGBTQ characters as homosexual visibility, gay assimilation, and queer consciousness/community. Labeling a narrative as homosexual visibility denoted a coming-out story where the character struggles with if, when, or how, ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 13 to tell others. In these stories, issues related to homosexuality are considered problems to be solved and drive the storyline (Cart & Jenkins, 2006, p. 134). The gay assimilation category meant the sexual orientation of the queer character was not a factor in the story (Cart & Jenkins, 2006, p. 143). Queer consciousness/community represented the inclusion of affirming friends and family and a place to belong (Cart & Jenkins, 2006, p. 146). Jenkins also noted if the character was lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender and if the narrative role was primary or secondary. A recent study identified high quality literature with LGBTQ content and offered rationale for use in the classroom (Logan, Lasswell, Hood, & Watson, 2014). The authors cited the concept of windows and mirrors, an analogy used to describe how literature allows the reader to see himself (the mirror) while providing information for the outsider, or a window into the lives of others (Logan et al., p. 33). This is an important consideration for combating homophobic bullying. Several researchers have found that the development of affective empathy decreases the occurrence of bullying (Dodaj, Sesar, Barisic, & Pandza, 2013), and through the window of literature, heterosexuals can gain an understanding of and appreciation for members of gender and sexual minorities. Students who realize they do not fit into the heteronormative paradigm can benefit from this self-affirming opportunity to see themselves in literary characters who have the same struggles and questions about life as they do. The same is true for works of nonfiction. Biographies, memoirs and essays that highlight contributions made by members of the LGBTQ community will combat stereotypes and provide role models for minority students. ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 14 Since 2008, The American Library Association has published a yearly Rainbow List of the best books with LGBTQ content for readers under the age of eighteen (Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Round Table, 2014). The lists are created by the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Round Table with the goal of honoring high quality books with authentic voices. Considering the fact that the American Library Association is a highly reputable and influential organization that recommends books to librarians, teachers and parents, the Rainbow Lists can be considered the authority on the best LGBTQ books published for middle level readers in a given year. To the best of my knowledge, the Rainbow Lists have never been used as a data pool for content analysis and will serve as an excellent source for researching high quality books that are available to middle school readers. With a desire to create a resource for teachers that enables them to make informed choices about books with gender and sexual minorities, I focused on these basic research questions: • How are members of the LGBTQ community portrayed in middle level books deemed exceptional by the American Library Association? • How much profanity and sexuality are found in these books? My second research question presupposes that a teacher will have difficulty rationalizing a book choice that has a high level of profanity and sexual content and would therefore benefit from knowing which books have the potential to create the most objections. ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 15 Methods This research followed qualitative content analysis research methodology (Kline, 2008 ; Krippendorff, 2013; Maxwell, 2010). Data pool and sample were the first step. The books chosen for this content analysis were taken from The American Library Association's 2013 and 2014 Rainbow Lists. I read any book that was designated for grades four through eight at their low range and added any Top Ten books that were intended for ninth grade and up. This provided a broad sample for low as well as higher level readers. I also added three books that did not make the Top Ten but were Stonewall Award winners and were intended for ninth grade and up (Adams, 2011; Charlton­Trujillo, 2013; Moskowitz, 2012). In total, 47 books fit my criteria. Thirty-one books were in the fourth-eighth grade category, and 16 were for ninth grade and up. Four were nonfiction, and 43 were fiction. This was my data sample. Open coding, or close scrutiny to identify patterns, was the second step in my research. As I read the books in my data pool, I looked for patterns in the demography of the LGBTQ representatives (gender identity and sexual orientation), as well as Cass ( 1979) stages of homosexual identity, and Jenkins' ( 1998) categories of narrative representation. I was also interested in identifying content that could aid the teacher in anticipating community complaints. If a district encouraged teaching about gender and sexual minorities, I reasoned that the next area of concern would probably relate to profanity and sexual content. I also categorized books according to the American Library Association recommended grade level as published in the Rainbow Lists, the ATOS book level (Renaissance Learning, 2014 ), and the Lexile level. The ATOS book level measures text complexity and correlates with Accelerated Reader, a popular reading ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 16 incentive program in middle schools. Even if a teacher is not using Accelerated Reader in the classroom, the ATOS book levels help match readers to appropriate texts (Renaissance Learning, 2014, p. 4). Lexile levels also measure text complexity and are part of the expectations of the Common Core State Standards for English language arts (NGA Center & CCSSO, 2010, appendix A, p. 8). As I read each book in my data pool, I completed a chart with the above categories. I also took note of the plot and any interesting anomalies. After the first read-through, I considered my initial findings and emergent patterns to create a research instrument that compiled the relevant information. I then reread the books to fully complete the chart. This was done to empirically determine the presence or absence of previously established patterns. This research conforms to best practice qualitative content analysis research methodology (Kline, 2008; Krippendorff, 2013; Maxwell, 2010). Definitions During the axial reading of each book, I took note of specific words and situations that relate to profanity, sexuality, and bullying. Because these are broad terms with a wide range of definition, I have explained below exactly what I noted and why. Profanity. In the tabulation of profanity in the reviewed books, I followed the framework of Coyne, Callister, Stockdale, Nelson, and Wells (2012) for the purpose of providing teachers information in choosing books appropriate for the student in a particular environment. Coyne et al. (2012) studied profanity in adolescent literature, coding for various categories of words. I chose to use several of their categories, including \"seven dirty words,\" based on Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 17 (shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits) by George Carlin. This was a comedy routine that garnered outrage in 1973 and led to a Supreme Court case that declared the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had the right to limit indecency in broadcasting. The words are still considered socially unacceptable in most parts of the United States (Bella, 2012). I also followed Coyne et al. (2012) in coding for \"mild other words\" (e.g., ass, damn) and \"strong other words\" (e.g., bastard, bitch). I also included homophobic slurs (e.g., fag, faggot, homo, dyke) that were given as examples in the 2013 National School Climate Survey: The Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Youth in our Nation 's Schools (Kosciw et al., 2014, p. 16). Each occurrence of a word from the above categories was recorded, tallied, and compared to the number of pages in the book. This allowed for the production of a ratio of potentially offensive words to number of pages, a quick way to determine how prevalent profanity and homophobic slurs were in a given book. Sexual Content. In the coding of sexual content I followed the framework of Callister et al. (2012) for the purpose of providing teachers more information about appropriate material for their middle level readers. I chose to use their categories labeled \"talk about sex,\" \"passionate kissing,\" \"intimate touching,\" \"implicit sexual intercourse\" and \"explicit sexual intercourse\" (p. 482). According to Callister et al. (2012), an example of intimate touching is caressing for the purpose of sexual stimulation (p. 480). Implicit sexual intercourse included descriptions that hinted that sexual intercourse occurred but were not overtly described. Explicit sexual intercourse graphically described the activity. Callister et al. (2012) coded several more nuanced elements of sexual activity than I used in this study. The categories I chose were broad for the sake ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT of simplicity and for the purpose of alerting the teacher to its presence instead of its frequency. Bullying. In the coding of bullying, I followed the framework of Kosciw et al. (2014) in the 2013 National School Climate Survey. They described the categories of bullying as follows: • verbal harassment (e.g., being called names or threatened) • physical harassment (e.g. , shoved or pushed) • physical assault (e.g., punched, kicked, or injury from a weapon) 18 • relational aggression (e.g. , being purposefully excluded by peers and being the target of mean rumors or lies) • electronic harassment (e.g., text messages, emails, instant messages, or postings on Internet sites such as Facebook) (Kosciw et al., 2014, pp. 22-24) Occurrences of bullying give the teacher means to discuss the topic with students and allow the reader to either identify with or develop empathy for the victims. Not every instance of bullying was coded, but its presence was noted. This project has its weaknesses. For example, I did not read these books as part of a team of colleagues, and as a result, the observations and conclusions are limited by my personal abilities. In addition, I studied a select group of books chosen by a committee and not the entirety of those published in a given time period. Some may argue that I bring a heteronormative bias because I am not part of the LGBTQ community; however, I do have a lesbian daughter. As with any researcher, I bring a ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT history and a perspective to my inquiry, and to the best of my ability, strive to maintain objectivity. Findings I employed the content analysis tool as I read 47 books with gender and sexual minority content. Particular categories of information, as previously discussed, were recorded and subsequent analysis revealed patterns across the categories. Finally, I discussed the significance of the findings as they relate to middle level readers. Genre 19 The majority of reviewed books were fiction (n = 43; 92%). Within fiction, subgenres were noted and tabulated. The most prevalent subgenre was realistic fiction (n = 24; 51 % ). Four books (9%) were coded as dystopian fiction because they took place in a future world that was the result of the destruction of our present world. Three books were coded as fantasy (6%) because they took place in worlds where the supernatural and mystical were part of life. Two books ( 4%) were coded as magical realism because supernatural elements contributed to an otherwise realistic story. Two books were works of poetry (4%), one narrative was science fiction (2%), and seven (15%) were graphic novels .  Only four books were nonfiction (9% ). These included two memoirs (Coyote, 2012; Moon& Lecesne, 2012), one history (Setterington, 2013), and an adult-themed gender workbook (Bornstein, 2013). See Appendix B for the genre of each reviewed book. The Common Core State Standards (NGA Center & CCSSO, 2010) aim to increase the reading of nonfiction texts to 50% of a student's reading load in sixth grade, increasing it to 55% by eighth grade (p. 5). Among these highly-rated books with ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 20 LGBTQ content, only four could be considered nonfiction, and only one, Branded by the Pink Triangle, was related to history (Setterington, 2013). The two memoires were personal reflections of growing up as members of the LGBTQ community. The fourth nonfiction book, My New Gender Workbook: A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving World Peace through Gender Anarchy and Sex Positivity (Bornstein, 2013) might be useful background information for the teacher with only some elements appropriate for classroom use. Overall, the nonfiction section of this data pool was not representative of what teachers need in their classrooms today. Reading Levels Lexile measures employ a quantitative method to describe text complexity. In theory, the lower the Lexile measure, the easier the text. Of the 47 reviewed books, Lexile measures were not available for sixteen (34% ). According Common Core expectations, independent readers (second graders) should be able to read texts in the Lexile range of 450L-790L. Two books fell below this range. The book with the lowest Lexile level (HL380L) was Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe (Saenz, 2012). This book is designated HL (high/low) because it has a low Lexile measure with subject matter more appropriate for higher grades. The only other book to fall below Common Core Lexile expectations was Drama (Telgemeier, 2012), a graphic novel with a Lexile measure of GN400L. Nearly half (n = 22;  47%) of the reviewed books fell into second and third grade range of 450L-790L. Nine of the reviewed books met the third and fourth grade Lexile range of 770L-980L. Only three books reached the sixth, seventh and eighth grade Lexile range of 955L-1155L. ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 2 1  As teachers attempt to help their students meet Common Core expectations on text complexity as defined by Lexile ranges, middle level educators will have little to choose from in this data pool. Only three books fell in the Lexile range for grades six, seven and eight. They were Branded by the Pink Triangle (11 lOL) (Setterington, 2013), The Difference Between You and Me (1020L) (George, 2012), and The Miseducation of Cameron Post (l 120L) (Danforth, 2012). Branded by the Pink Triangle (Setterington, 2013) is a history of Nazi persecution of gender and sexual minorities, and the other two are fiction with adolescent lesbian protagonists. Such a small sampling of books would hardly meet the needs of every middle school student. Even though Lexile ranges are specifically cited as Common Core expectations (NGA Center & CCSSO, 2010, Appendix A, p. 8), other considerations, such as ATOS book levels and published grade level recommendations (available in Appendix C,  entitled Reading Levels) should be consulted to gain a more complete view of a particular book and increase the choices available to middle level teachers, students, and interested parents. Identity In the 47 reviewed books, 25 (53%) included male gay characters. Lesbian characters appeared in 19 books ( 40% ) . Five books ( 11 % ) contained bisexual characters, 10 books (21 %) included transgender individuals and two (4%) portrayed intersex persons. One short story, \"Jelson,\" in OMG Queer (Radclyffe & Lynch, eds. , 2012) featured an asexual character. Among the books that told the story of only one gender identity or sexual orientation, 14 (30%) featured only male gay characters, 13 (28%) depicted only lesbians and six (13%) portrayed only transgender characters. See ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 22 Appendix D, entitled Character Representation, for the identities found in each reviewed book. One interesting aspect of this analysis was the number of books with trans gender content. The first young adult novel about a transgender character was Luna by Julie Anne Peters published in 2004 (Cart & Jenkins, 2010, p. 160). From 2005 to 2011, the years leading up to this data pool, only eleven books with transgender characters were chosen for the American Library Association's yearly Rainbow Lists. In other words, from 2004 to 2011, only twelve books in eight years were considered high quality young adult books with transgender content (1.5 books per year). In the two years of this data pool (Rainbow Lists 2013 and 2014), 10 books met this criteria (five books per year). Over time, it is likely that more texts with transgender content will be available for middle level classroom use. Narrative Role In most of the 47 reviewed books, a gender or sexual minority character was placed in the primary role of protagonist (n = 37 ; 79% ). Fourteen books (30%) had members of the LGBTQ community as both primary and secondary characters. Six books (13%) placed minority characters in secondary roles only. Appendix D, Character Representation, lists the narrative roles for each book in this data pool. These results show progress in the historical place of gender and sexual minority characters in young adult literature. According to Cart and Jenkins (2006, appendix C), from 1969 to 2004, LGBTQ protagonists appeared in only 37% of young adult fiction with queer content. This shift toward a greater number of gender and sexual minority protagonists means readers will encounter more fully developed, sympathetic, multi-ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 23 dimensional characters. If one reason to incorporate LGBTQ characters in the curriculum is to provide opportunities for identification and empathy (Logan et al., p. 33), stories with minority protagonists could help teachers meet that goal. Character Portrayal Cart and Jenkins (2006) identified three categories of LGBTQ character portrayal in young adult literature: visibility, assimilation, and community. Visibility denoted a coming out story where a character's sexual orientation or gender identity was viewed as a secret or a problem to solve. In this data pool, 23 books (49%) were primarily about visibility or coming out. The second category, assimilation, described storylines in which the sexual orientation or gender identity of the minority character was of little consequence. Six books (13 % ) portrayed gender and sexual minorities as assimilated. The third category was community where the minority characters had friends and/or family members who loved and accepted them. Twenty-three books (49%) portrayed LGBTQ characters in community. See Appendix D entitled Character Representation for information on portrayal in each reviewed book. Cart and Jenkins (2006, Appendix C) reported that in young adult books with LGBTQ content published from 1969-2004 an overwhelming majority (85%) focused on homosexual visibility (coming out) while only 16% included minority characters in community. The fact that 49% of this data pool portrayed gender and sexual minorities in community shows how quickly the literary environment has changed for these characters. Books that treat sexual orientation or gender identity as something to hide and eventually reveal speak to students experiencing these issues themselves, and coming-out stories help others understand the emotional turmoil these students face. ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 24 However, balancing this angst with narratives that portray love and acceptance for gender and sexual minority characters (community and assimilation) challenges stereotypes and offers hope that no matter how a person identifies, they can have a place to belong. Cass (1979) Stages As discussed previously, the Cass (1979) model of homosexual identity formation outlines steps toward self acceptance. Originally designed to describe gay men and women, I applied the categories to all gender and sexual minorities found in the 47 reviewed books. Nineteen books ( 40%) portrayed members of the LGBTQ community in various stages or moving through the stages which suggests that the characters in those books are most likely to be multidimentional and exhibit personal growth. The Cass (1979) stage most represented was Stage 6, Identity Synthesis, (n = 22; 47%) which is the last stage of self acceptance. Similarly, 21 books ( 45%) included characters in Stage 4, Identity Acceptance. The characters at this stage had some level of peace about their gender identity or sexual orientation and exhibited selective \"coming out.\" Fewer stories portrayed Stage 2, Identity Comparison (n = 7 ;  15%), Stage 3, Identity Tolerance (n = 6 ;  13%), and Stage 5 ,  Identity Pride (n = 6 ;  13%). One reason for this could be that Stage 2 and Stage 3 are not very interesting from a narrative point of view. In regard to Stage 5, Identity Pride, I looked for evidence of a character devaluing heterosexuality, one of the hallmarks of this stage (Cass, 1979, p. 233), and that behavior was not prevalent. See Appendix D entitled Character Representation for the Cass ( 1979) Stages portrayed in each reviewed book. ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 25 Table 1 Cass ( 1979) Stages Represented in Reviewed Books Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4 Stage 5 Stage 6 Multi Identity Identity Identity Identity Identity Identity Stages Confusion Comparison Tolerance Acceptance Pride Synthesis Books 13 7 6 21 6 22 19 Percent 28% 15% 13% 45% 13% 47% 40% When students read stories that include people facing the same questions and fears they experience, they can identify, engage, and observe various ways to respond. Fortunately, this data pool provides books that portray members of the LGBTQ community in every Cass ( 1979) Stage, and a high percentage are moving forward and living in Stage 6 where sexual orientation or gender identity is just one part of a multifaceted personality. In Stage 6, characters have connected with others in healthy relationships which might include marriage and parenting. These books can offer hope for students who feel trapped or afraid, giving them a vision for the future and role models that lead the way. Bullying The most frequently noted type of bullying in this data pool was verbal harassment (n = 33; 70%), followed by relational aggression (n = 26; 55%) which is being shunned or slandered. Electronic harassment was low (n = 8 ;  17% ), perhaps due to the wide variety of time periods portrayed. Electronic bullying is a factor beginning in the early 21st Century, and many of the reviewed books take place in the past or in a ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 26 world without communication devices. Ten books (21 % ) were free of bullying. See Appendix E for the bullying content in each reviewed book. Table 2 Presence of Bullying in Reviewed Books Verbal Physical Physical Relational Electronic None Harassment Harassment Assault Aggression Harassment Books 33 16 16 26 8 10 Percentage 70% 34% 34% 55% 17% 21% Anti-bullying efforts are common in middle school, and each book in this data pool offers examples and material for discussion. Even the ten books without bullying content could be used to discuss why the characters were not bullied and how that affected their lives. Verbal harassment and relational aggression are the most common types of bullying reported by LGBTQ students in The 2013 National School Climate Survey (Kosciw et al., 2014, pp. 22, 24), and this data pool gives ample examples of both. Challenging Content According to the Office for Intellectual Freedom and the Public Information Office (2014), when a book is challenged for removal from a school, parents are by far the number one source of those requests. The most common reasons for removal are sexually explicit content first and objectionable language second. The following findings can alert the teacher to potential challenges from parents. Profanity. Objectionable words, as defined previously, were counted in each reviewed book. The total was then divided by the number of pages in the book to yield a quotient less than one. The smaller the result, the smaller the percentage of profanity was ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 27 found in the narrative. Six books of the 47 reviewed were found to have no objectionable language. Twenty-one books fell in the range of .004 to .1 .  In other words, 57% (n = 27) of the books in this data pool were relatively low in profanity. Nine books fell in the range of .11 to .2, and nine books were .21 or higher. Gone, Gone, Gone (Moskowitz, 2012) had the highest profanity quotient of .861. As teachers plan lessons with books in this data pool, Appendix F, Profanity and Sexual Content, provides a way to gauge which books might cause fewer complaints. It also gives quantitative information to share with parents. Other factors such as the importance of the narrative relative to the curriculum could also bolster a book's acceptability. Sexual content. Of the 4 7 reviewed books, 19 ( 40%) contained no sexual content as previously defined. The type of sexual content most frequently noted was passionate kissing (n = 19; 40%) and intimate touch (n = 19; 40% ). Explicit descriptions of intercourse were found in seven books (15%) and implicit intercourse appeared in 14 books (30% ). Table 3 Presence of Sexual Content in Reviewed Books Talk Passionate Intimate Implicit Explicit about Kissing Touch Intercourse Intercourse Sex None Books 17 19 19 14 7 19 Percentage 36% 40% 40% 30% 15% 40% Sexually explicit content is the most common reason for challenging a book (Office for Intellectual Freedom & Public Information Office, 2014). Fortunately, 19 ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 28 books in this data pool are free of this type of content. See Appendix F entitled Profanity and Sexual Content for the sexual content present in each reviewed book. It is interesting to note that one of the most banned books of 2014 was Drama (Telgemeier, 2013) because of \"sexually explicit content\" (American Library Association, 2013), yet was coded for zero sexual content in this research because the kissing and touching were not passionate or intimate. Even with the best preparation and forethought, any book in this data pool could be challenged due to the presence of gender and sexual minorities. Discussion The 47 books reviewed in this research offer high quality narratives with gender and sexual minority content for middle level readers. The analysis of genre, reading levels, characterizations, and bullying aids the teacher in choosing books to meet curricular objectives. Advanced notice about the profanity and sexual content in a book might help avoid challenges from community members. Complete information for each reviewed book is found in the appendices. Reading levels (Appendix C) are useful for matching readers with appropriate texts. For independent reading or literature circles, each student could choose a book with a gender or sexual minority character at their individual ATOS or Lexile level . Struggling readers are likely to do well with graphic novels like the Kevin Keller series (Parent, 2012) and Avengers: The Children 's Crusade (Heinberg, 2012), and Drama (Telgemeier, 2012). If Accelerated Reader is used as a reading incentive program, any book in this data pool with an ATOS level (Appendix C) could be read for points. If a book in Appendix C does not have an ATOS level at the time of this writing, it might be added to AR BookFinder (Renaissance Leaming, 2014), a website that reports reading ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 29 levels for any book in its system. Even though books in this data pool have appropriate reading levels for middle school students, the content might be more mature than expected. Cross referencing a book with its profanity and sexual content (Appendix F) will give more information about its suitability. Language Arts teachers will find narratives in this research that can serve the dual purpose of including gender and sexual minorities in various literary forms. Freak Boy (Clark, 2013), the story of two transgender individuals, is book-length verse, and the format of the poetry is continually changing. For example, an entry about Christmas is in the shape of a Christmas tree. October Mourning: A Song for Matthew Shepard (Newman, 2012) is also written in verse with a glossary of poetic forms in back. The Song of Achilles (Miller, 2012) and Love in the Time of Global Warming (Block, 2013) are both retellings of Homer. The first reinterprets the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus and the second takes place in a dystopian future with characters continually referring to Homer. Short stories and essays could be explored in One in Every Crowd (Coyote, 2012), OMG Queer: Short Stories by Queer Youth (Radclyffe & Lynch, eds., 2012), and The Letter Q: Queer Writers ' Notes to their Younger Selves (Moon & Lecesne, 2012) . School counselors and advisory teachers might find books related to the Cass (1979) Stages useful for their students (see Appendix D). Better Nate than Ever (Federle, 2013) is an example of an eighth grade boy in Stage 1 who begins to wonder, \"Am I gay?\" It is a lighthearted story, told by Nate, giving his spin on being bullied and loving Broadway shows. Archenemies (Hoblin, 2013) is the story of Addie, a high school junior who has faced prejudice but is fully accepted at home. When Addie misinterprets Eva's ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT affection, Eva over reacts and becomes her \"archenemy.\" Addie represents a person in Stage 6 (Identity Synthesis or full acceptance), while Eva represents Stage 1 (Identity Confusion). 30 On the topic of bullying, Appendix E charts the type of bullying found in each reviewed book. To focus on cyber bullying, for example, the category \"electronic harassment\" highlights which books include that form of bullying. Multiple types of harassment were apparent in Tess Masterson will go to Prom (Franklin, 2012), a story that explores homophobia in a small Midwestern town. Tess and her family's grocery store are targeted by community rallies and the media when she plans to go to prom with a girl, and fellow students torment her at school. Several books in this data pool could be useful to social studies teachers. For example, the issue of marriage equality was an important part of My Mixed Up Berry Blue Summer, (Gennarum, 2012). June is 12 years old and her mom plans to marry her girlfriend. People in the town boycott their shop, display anti-gay marriage signs, and distribute flyers. June does her own research at the library and learns that she has nothing to be ashamed of. In the study of World War II and the Holocaust, Branded by the Pink Triangle (Setterington, 2013) discusses pre-war attitudes toward members of the LGBTQ community, then the imprisonment and execution of gender and sexual minorities, followed by their treatment after the war. Branded by the Pink Triangle (Setterington, 2013) includes primary source photographs, political cartoons, and firsthand accounts, as well as charts, maps, and timelines, useful for developing content area reading skills. In the study of non-Western cultures, If You Could be Mine (Farizan, 2013) takes place in modern day Iran. Nasrin and Sahar are childhood friends who are in love with each ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 3 1  other, but being gay is punishable by death. Being transgender, however, is acceptable, so Nasrin considers having an operation to make her legally male so she can marry Sahar. Many of the books in this data pool can be integrated into the curriculum. Whether it is a simple suggestion for free reading or a whole-class detailed analysis, books with LGBTQ content can serve multiple purposes. High quality books at the right Lexile level can help students meet national and state standards. They can also provide comfort and guidance for students concerned about their own gender identity or sexual orientation while at the same time encouraging empathy in those who might be prone to bullying. I hope the information compiled here will be used as a tool for teachers and parents to find the right books for their students. Conclusion Equal rights and protections for gender and sexual minorities are likely to increase in the coming years. As a result, teachers will need resources to reflect that reality in the classroom. National organizations like GLSEN (GLSEN, Inc., 2016) offer education and professional development. The GSA Network (GSA Network , 2009) provides mentoring and resources for students to combat homophobia and trans phobia. The FAIR Education Act (Our Family Coalition, n.d.) is a website dedicated to social studies lesson plans that include gender and sexual minorities as well as persons with disabilities. For those who wish to develop their knowledge base and contribute toward a safer, more successful school environment for LGBTQ indentifying students, practical help and resources are available. In regard to future research, I believe similar content analyses focused on nonfiction books about gender and sexual minorities would be useful. Currently, few ANALYSIS OF LGBTQ CONTENT 32 high quality biographies, memoirs and topical texts exist for middle level readers, as reflected in this research, but over time, perhaps in response to the expectations of national and state standards, more will be published. Another avenue of interest would be the analysis of picture books and texts for younger readers that have LGBTQ content. The inclusion of gender and sexual minorities in curricula is a new field of research and an important addition to our body of knowledge.

    "abstract": "Middle school is often the time students become aware of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and in many schools, perceived nonheteronormative behavior is penalized through bullying. One way schools can reduce bullying and increase successful learning environments is to include trade books that feature gender and sexual minorities. State and national standards set expectations for social and emotional learning as well as critical analysis of high quality reading materials. This research analyzed trade books from the 2013 and 2014 Rainbow Lists which were chosen by the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Round Table of the American Library Association as the best books published with LGBTQ content the previous year for readers under the age of 18. Forty-seven books at the fourth through ninth grade levels were coded for genre, character identity, role, portrayal, reading levels, Cass (1979) Stages, bullying events, profanity, and sexual content. Profanity and sexual content were coded to anticipate community objections. Suggestions for the use of specific books in classroom situations are discussed",
