Although seventeen states and the District of Columbia have passed laws prohib-iting employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity andanother four states have passed laws prohibiting employment discrimination on the basisof sexual orientation without a similar prohibition on gender identity discrimination,legal commentators have observed that state and local laws are often ineffective in com-batting employment discrimination.

The first instancewas in 1996 when the Senate failed to pass ENDA by a single vote.14The second instance was in 2007 when the House passed ENDA by avote of 235 to 184,15 notwithstanding President George W.

House Speaker John Boehner is a longtime opponent of ENDA19and has indicated that he will not allow the bill to come up for a vote.20House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, moreover, has confirmed thatENDA is not scheduled for consideration anytime in the foreseeablefuture,21 and not one of the four House committees having jurisdictionover ENDA has taken any action on the bill.22  ENDA, therefore,appears destined to die with the adjournment of the 113th Congressand is unlikely to become law as long as Republicans control one ormore houses of Congress or the presidency.23This article rejects the notion that ENDA’s opponents can be per-suaded to support the bill with additional substantive concessions andconcludes that executive action is necessary to protect LGBT personsagainst employment discrimination.  Part I examines the two most com-mon rationales for opposing ENDA and concludes that they are pretextfor discrimination.  For many of the legislators opposing ENDA, noamount of revisions to the bill’s substantive provisions would be suffi-cient to win their support because they fundamentally disagree with thebill’s basic premise that LGBT persons are deserving of workplace pro-16.

Part II demonstrates that President Obama may unilaterallyextend explicit status-based protections to a significant number ofLGBT workers in both the public and private sectors, while at the sametime signaling his support for a burgeoning movement within the fed-eral judiciary whereby LGBT-related employment discrimination isregarded as actionable sex discrimination under Title VII of the CivilRights Act of 1964.I. THE PROFFERED RATIONALES FOR OPPOSING ENDARepresentative Barney Frank, the lead sponsor of ENDA in the110th, 111th, and 112th Congresses, believes that the two most com-monly asserted rationales for opposing ENDA are pretext.24  Accordingto Representative Frank, the real reason many lawmakers oppose ENDAis because they view LGBT-oriented employment discrimination as a“good thing” that should be encouraged rather than prohibited.25  Acloser examination of the proffered rationales confirms that they are aslikely to be motivated by anti-LGBT animus as they are sincerely-heldconcerns regarding free enterprise or religious liberty.A. The Supposed Threat to the Business CommunityENDA has always contained provisions designed to make the billmore palatable to industry, but the number of concessions hasincreased markedly over time.The earliest concessions were designed to assuage the businesscommunity’s concerns that ENDA would prove to be as robust anantidiscrimination statute as Title VII.  Title VII, for instance, allowsplaintiffs to contest intentional discrimination on a disparate treatmenttheory whereas inadvertent discrimination is actionable on a disparateimpact theory.26  ENDA, in contrast, would permit only disparate treat-ment claims such that facially neutral employment practices having adisproportionately adverse effect on LGBT persons would not beactionable.27  Title VII, moreover, permits affirmative action for racialminorities and women in certain circumstances.28  ENDA, on the otherhand, would prohibit affirmative action on the basis of sexual orienta-tion or gender identity even if LGBT persons were significantly under-24.

The Chamber had significant concerns with earlydrafts of the legislation (H.R. 2015), for example, the extent towhich the bill would erode ERISA preemption or permit disparateimpact claims to be brought.  We have expressed these concernsto proponents of the legislation and it appears that the vast major-ity of these concerns were addressed when the House passed theEmployment Non-Discrimination Act (H.R. 3685) on November7, 2007.  The Chamber continues to carefully monitor these billsas they move through the legislative process.49Significantly, the Chamber has remained neutral even as ENDAhas been expanded to include gender identity protections.  In a 2011legislative update to its membership, the Chamber attributed its contin-ued neutrality to the array of industry-oriented concessions containedin the bill:In past years, the Chamber negotiated with supporters of theEmployment Non-Discrimination Act to ensure that the billaccomplishes its goal without unintended consequences.  As aresult of these negotiations, the bill has been improved so that itdoes not erode ERISA preemption, impose a disparate impactcause of action, or require construction of new or additional facili-ties.  The current bill respects all of the negotiations made by theChamber in prior years.5046.

The six senators whoopposed ENDA in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-mittee (“HELP Committee”), for example, warned that private employ-ers would be subjected to a torrent of baseless lawsuits should ENDA beenacted.54  These senators noted that the bill “makes no provisions for,nor seems to in any way acknowledge the potential for, nefarious abuseof employment protections” and asserted that “[t]his oversight creates agaping hole which could leave employers powerless and confused abouthow to prevent abuse.”55  Similarly, House Speaker John Boehner hasindicated that he will not allow ENDA to receive a vote in the U.S.House of Representatives because he believes the bill “will increase friv-olous litigation and cost American jobs, especially small businessjobs.”56  Yet, an examination of the available data indicates that thesecontentions are dubious at best and dishonest at worst.51.

Had the GAO report found that sex-ual orientation and gender identity discrimination claims represented5% or more of the complaints filed in these states, ENDA’s opponentsmight have a stronger argument that the bill stands to increase frivolouslitigation.  Because the percentage of claims filed is almost perfectlycorrelated with the percentage of LGBT persons, however, fears thatENDA would unleash a torrent of baseless litigation are unwarranted.Concerns that ENDA will have a particularly deleterious effect onsmall businesses are equally unjustified.  Like all federal antidiscrimina-tion statutes, ENDA contains an exemption for small businesses.64Employers with 14 or fewer employees will not be subject to ENDA andmay continue to discriminate against LGBT persons without fear of vio-lating federal law.65When asked to specify how ENDA will “cost American jobs, espe-cially small business jobs,” Speaker Boehner’s spokesperson stated,“[o]bviously, many private employers will face additional costs [underENDA] . . . and those costs will lead to job losses.  (Especially for smallbusinesses that cannot afford the legal fees).”66  As noted earlier, how-ever, ENDA is unlikely to elicit a significant amount of frivolous litiga-tion, meaning small businesses stand to incur substantial legal fees onlyif they intentionally discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation orgender identity.Moreover, the same CBO estimate cited by Speaker Boehner insupport of his contention that ENDA will increase frivolous litigationnotes that private employers’ expenses in implementing ENDA will belimited to “the costs of modifying employment procedures and postingnotices to avoid discriminatory practices.”67  The CBO acknowledges“that changes to employment procedures would likely build on ongoingtraining and updates to personnel manuals” and concedes that the“costs of notices would probably be relatively minor and would be madein the course of other routine updates.”68  ENDA’s implementation63.

Of those small busi-nesses that do not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexualorientation, only 2% report that cost concerns deterred them from pro-viding employment protections to LGB persons.78  Of those small busi-nesses that do not prohibit discrimination on the basis of genderidentity, only 4% report that cost concerns deterred them from provid-ing employment protections to transgender individuals.79  Instead,most of these businesses conceded that they simply never thought toadopt such policies or did not believe they had any LGBT employeeswho stood to benefit from the adoption of such policies.80While Speaker Boehner and his colleagues would have the publicbelieve that their opposition to ENDA stems from sincerely-held con-cerns regarding the bill’s potential to engender frivolous litigation andimpose burdensome regulations on small businesses, these legislators’prior statements suggest that their opposition is motivated, at least inpart, by animus toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons.  Shortly afterthe U.S. House voted to pass a gender identity-exclusive version ofENDA in 2007, House Minority Leader John Boehner issued the follow-ing statement:There is no doubt that this legislation will lead to endless, exces-sive litigation that will further bog down our courts at a high costto employers, workers, and taxpayers.  For example, the bill pur-ports to protect workers based on their ‘perceived’ sexual orienta-tion – a highly subjective concept that is bound to tie the legalsystem in knots.  Congress would be well-served to focus on ways toreduce the amount of frivolous lawsuits, not compound the prob-lem by adding new, obscure ways for trial lawyers to game thesystem.This legislation also drastically weakens religious freedom in theworkplace and puts activist judges in the position of imposingsame-sex marriage and civil union laws on states.  Simply by usingENDA as the basis of their decisions – just as state Supreme Courtshave done with state-level ENDA laws in the past – liberal judgeswill be empowered under this legislation to single-handedlyundermine state and federal marriage laws across the country.I’m disappointed that the Majority turned back a straightforwardproposal offered by House Republicans to protect state and fed-eral marriage laws from being overturned, modified, or restrictedby activist judges as a result of this deeply flawed legislation.8178.

And you don’thave to take my word for it.  A memo from the Marriage Law Pro-ject at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law noted this:“ENDA is about more than jobs.  It is also about marriage.  ENDAis based on the idea that State laws restricting marriage to theunion of one man and one woman are a ‘subterfuge’ for discrimi-nation against homosexuals and bisexuals.  If the courts acceptthe proposition that marriage is a ‘subterfuge’ for discriminationon the basis of sexual orientation, the Defense of Marriage Act willbe struck down as unconstitutional.”And that is the goal, Mr. Speaker.  This legislation will ultimatelyallow activist judges across the country to redefine the institutionof marriage.  The majority might say that is not their intent, but Iguarantee that is exactly what will happen if ENDA passes as it is.If we don’t vote to stop it, then we are tacitly allowing one of ourmost sacred institutions to be torn down.This legislation will provide certain activist judges with the legaljustification to strike down State and Federal marriage laws thatdefine marriage as between one man and one woman.  StateENDA laws are being used by activist judges to impose same-sexmarriage and civil unions on States.  State courts are using ENDAand other similar laws to justify the argument that the governmenthas no rational basis to continue discriminating in the area ofmarriage.

The fact that neither of theserationales has any factual basis suggests that the proffered justificationsare pretext and that opposition to same-sex unions continues to be amotivating factor in these lawmakers’ decision to oppose ENDA.Although fears that ENDA’s passage would lead to the invalidation ofDOMA are now largely moot, Speaker Boehner and his colleaguesostensibly remain concerned that ENDA will empower “activist judges”to “impos[e] same-sex marriage” on the individual states.87  Therefore,unless the United States Supreme Court one day recognizes a constitu-tional right to same-sex marriage, Speaker Boehner and his colleagueswill likely continue to oppose ENDA even if additional industry-ori-ented concessions are included in the bill.B. The Supposed Threat to Religious OrganizationsAlthough ENDA has always contained an exemption for religiousorganizations, the scope of the exemption has broadened significantlyover time.  The first four iterations of the bill sought to distinguishbetween religious organizations’ non-profit and for-profit activities, withonly the former warranting exemption from ENDA’s coverage.88  Thisdistinction was subsequently abandoned in the 107th and 108th Con-gresses in favor of a categorical exemption providing, “[t]his Act shallnot apply to a religious organization.”89When ENDA’s proponents in the 110th Congress sought to limitthe exemption to organizations having “religious ritual or worship orthe teaching or spreading of religious doctrine or belief” as their pri-mary purpose,90 opponents in the House balked and demanded thatthe exemption be revised to track the analogous provisions of TitleVII,91 which permit religious organizations to discriminate on the basisof religion but not race, color, sex, or national origin.92  Thereafter,proponents in the House introduced an amendment providing thatorganizations exempt from the religious discrimination provisions ofTitle VII would be exempt from the sexual orientation and genderidentity provisions of ENDA.93  The House adopted the amendment bya vote of 402 to 25, with House Minority Leader John Boehner andChief Deputy Republican Whip Eric Cantor both supporting the revised87.

The firstamendment was sponsored by Senator Rob Portman and sought toensure that government agencies would not be permitted to penalizean employer qualifying for ENDA’s religious exemption by withholding“licenses, permits, certifications, accreditation, contracts, grants, guar-antees, tax-exempt status, or any benefits or exemptions from thatemployer.”101  The amendment also sought to insert a sentence in thebill’s “purposes” section acknowledging that equal employment oppor-tunity for LGBT persons must be balanced against and made consistentwith notions of religious liberty.102  By including the latter provision,Senator Portman sought to guard against the possibility that federalcourts would interpret ENDA as creating a compelling governmentalinterest in eradicating LGBT-oriented employment discrimination thatwould trump religious organizations’ statutorily-conferred right todiscriminate.103ing that the current version of the religious exemption “is not a broad exemption; it is atotal exemption”);  Editorial, Toward Ending Workplace Discrimination, N.Y.

I votedfor it because it prohibits discrimination that should not occur in theworkplace, it protects the rights of religious entities, and minimizeslegal burdens on employers.”118Yet, some legislators continue to insist that the exemption is toonarrow.  Of the 32 senators who opposed ENDA on final passage, onlyone took to the floor to speak against the bill, and his criticisms focusedexclusively on the religious exemption.119  Senator Dan Coats began hisremarks by declaring, “the legislation before us raises very serious con-cerns regarding religious freedom” and went on to assert that “the so-called protections for religious liberty in this bill are vaguely definedand do not extend to all organizations that wish to adhere to theirmoral or religious beliefs in their hiring practices.”120  In regard to thePortman and Toomey Amendments, Senator Coats conceded, “some[m]embers believe that these amendments go too far.  I frankly believethey don’t go far enough.”121  The Senator concluded by stating, “Ihope my colleagues would stand with me in protecting our religiousfreedom and oppose this legislation.”122While Senator Coats would have his colleagues believe that he isprimarily concerned with the preservation of religious liberty, his priorstatements regarding ENDA indicate that his opposition is motivated, atleast in part, by animus toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons.  Sena-tor Coats’ remarks in the 104th Congress emphasize his belief thathomosexuality is immoral and seek to alienate the LGB communityfrom the broader civil rights movement by portraying ENDA as anattempt to extend legal protections on the basis of behavior rather thanimmutable characteristics:Mr. President, today’s debate concerns an issue of extreme importand controversy—extending civil rights protection to sexualorientation.This is an issue of great importance because, for the first time inour history, Federal legislation would protect an individual’sbehavior, rather than an individual’s status, as traditional civil116.

The practical impact of this bill is thatemployers will no longer be able to consider or hold an employeeaccountable for any acts related to their sexual orientation.The fact that this issue—the extension of civil rights to an individ-ual’s behavior—is controversial goes without saying.  This is anissue about gay rights in the workplace, which the American peo-ple have not reached a moral consensus [on].  Many Americans,including business people, those who support strong traditionalfamilies, and persons with religious or moral objections, have seri-ous concerns about promoting homosexuality as a lifestyle.  This isimportant, because if this bill becomes law, it will give the Federalstamp of approval to activities that are still considered illegal inmany States.  It is significant also because individual employers,employees, forprofit [sic] religious organizations and enterpriseswill no longer be able to conduct their business without the fear ofFederal intrusion and potentially costly litigation.Mr. President, we are not speaking of extending rights that everycitizen of the United States is guaranteed—rather we are consider-ing special rights for persons based on their lifestyle choice, asevidenced by their behavior.  I share the concern of many that noperson be subjected to violence and hatred simply because theydo not meet with societal approval.  But I am just as concernedabout individuals who, because of sincerely and deeply held relig-ious or moral convictions, find certain lifestyles to be morallyunacceptable and yet are told by the Government that thosebeliefs must be kept private and may not be applied to their busi-ness decisions.  These individuals are told that the [F]irst[A]mendment’s protections do not apply to the way they run theirbusinesses, their family bookstore, or their day care center.  Thisshould not be the case.I ask my colleagues to join with me in voting to preserve one ofour Nation’s most cherished rights: The freedom to freely exer-cise our religious beliefs and to not be coerced by the Govern-ment into accepting into our employ those whose behaviorviolates our deeply held religious convictions.123Later that same day, Senator Coats characterized same-sex mar-riage as “trendy moral relativism” and “a sign . . . of a deep moral confu-sion” while expressing his support for the bill that would ultimatelybecome DOMA.124For legislators like Senator Coats, the religious exemption willalways be inadequate unless it is expanded to include secular commer-cial employers.125  Such an exemption, however, would effectively nul-lify the statute by allowing virtually any employer to claim they are123. 142 CONG.

While Senator Coats and his colleagues may har-bor sincere concerns regarding ENDA’s implications for religious lib-erty, they are at least equally likely to be motivated by anti-LGBTanimus, as evidenced by Senator Coats’ prior statements regardingENDA and DOMA.  Thus, Senator Coats and his colleagues will likelycontinue to oppose ENDA even if the exemption for nonprofit relig-ious organizations is further expanded.II. REDRESSING LGBT EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATIONVIA EXECUTIVE ORDERGiven that the two most commonly asserted rationales for oppos-ing ENDA are pretext, further substantive concessions in these areasare unlikely to garner additional support for the bill.  Many lawmakersreject ENDA’s basic premise that LGBT persons are deserving of work-place protections and instead view LGBT-related employment discrimi-nation as “a good thing” that should be encouraged rather thanprohibited.  Because ENDA is unlikely to become law as long as itsopponents are motivated by LGBT animus, President Obama shouldact unilaterally and issue two executive orders providing meaningfulemployment protections to LGBT workers.The first order would amend Executive Order 11478, which pro-tects federal civilian employees against discrimination on the basis ofrace, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, age, sexual orienta-tion, or status as a parent126 to include gender identity and sexual ori-entation as subcategories of the existing “sex” classification.127  Thisorganizations that wish to adhere to their moral or religious beliefs in their hiring prac-tices”). The Senate HELP Committee noted:[S]ome have expressed concern that the religious beliefs of employers andemployees are not sufficiently protected [under ENDA]. They argue that thosewhose religion dictates that homosexuality is wrong will be forced to hire orwork with gay men and lesbians. [Such] arguments are not new to the civil rightsdebate, but our Nation’s laws rightly require non-religious organizations andentities, particularly those who participate in commercial activity, to adhere tobroad principles of fairness and equality.S.

As amended, Executive Order 11478 would protect federal civilian employeesagainst discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including gender identityand sexual orientation), national origin, handicap, age, or status as a parent.This would mimic one of two approaches taken by federal agencies in adding genderidentity to their equal employment opportunity policies.  Eleven agencies include genderidentity within a parenthetical of the “sex” classification, e.g., race, color, religion, sex(including gender identity), national origin, etc., whereas twelve agencies list genderidentity as a stand-alone classification, e.g., race, color, religion, sex, gender identity,national origin, etc. Mathew S.

Amending Executive Order 11478 in thismanner, moreover, would serve to affirm the EEOC’s 2012 decision inMacy v. Holder, which found that discrimination on the basis of an indi-vidual’s transgender status is per se actionable under Title VII as a formof sex discrimination,128 while proactively advancing the related pro-position that sexual orientation discrimination is itself a form of sexdiscrimination predicated on LGB individuals’ failure to conform togender stereotypes.129Historically, federal courts have been inclined to dismiss sex dis-crimination claims brought by LGBT workers for fear these individualsare attempting to bootstrap sexual orientation and gender identity pro-tections into Title VII.130  Within the last few years, however, a small butsignificant number of courts have allowed openly LGBT persons to con-test employment discrimination on a gender-stereotyping theory of sexdiscrimination.131  The inclusion of gender identity and sexual orienta-tion within Executive Order 11478’s existing “sex” classification wouldsignal President Obama’s support for this more expansive understand-ing of sex discrimination, providing an impetus for additional courts toadopt an LGBT-inclusive interpretation of Title VII that permits privatesector LGBT workers to state cognizable sex discrimination claims.The second order would amend Executive Order 11246, whichprohibits federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of race,color, religion, sex, or national origin,132 to include gender identityand sexual orientation as subcategories of the existing “sex” classifica-whereas every federal agency lists sexual orientation as a stand-alone classification pursu-ant to Executive Order 13087, the proposed amendment would require that all agenciesdelete these provisions and include sexual orientation, together with gender identity, in aparenthetical following the “sex” classification.On June 30, 2014, President Obama announced that he would issue an executiveorder protecting federal civilian employees against discrimination on the basis of genderidentity but did not discuss the format or timing of the proposed order.

If an employee declines to request a hearing before an EEOC administrativejudge and the agency finds that there was no discrimination, the employee has the rightto appeal the agency’s decision to the EEOC Office of Federal Operations or file a lawsuitin federal court. Conversely, if an employee requests a hearing before an EEOC adminis-trative judge, the judge will render a decision, and the agency will then issue a final orderindicating whether the agency agrees with the judge’s decision. If the agency disagreeswith any part of the administrative judge’s decision, the agency must appeal the decisionto the EEOC Office of Federal Operations.

The EEOC made this determination in the 2012 case ofMacy v. Holder.151In Macy, the EEOC reversed the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ”)determination that claims of gender identity discrimination are ineligi-ble for adjudication under the 1614 process and instead held “thatclaims of discrimination based on transgender status, also referred to asclaims of discrimination based on gender identity, are cognizable underTitle VII’s sex discrimination prohibition, and may therefore beprocessed under Part 1614. . . .”152  Although the DOJ had agreed toinvestigate Mia Macy’s sex discrimination claim under Title VII consis-tent with the 1614 process, the DOJ informed Macy that her genderidentity claim would have to be investigated under the DOJ’s internalEEO procedures as such claims were ostensibly outside the scope ofTitle VII.153  Macy opposed the “de facto dismissal” of her gender iden-tity claim because the DOJ’s internal EEO procedures do not provide asmany rights and remedies as are available under Title VII and the 1614process.154  On appeal, the EEOC held that “each of the formulationsof [Macy’s] claims are simply different ways of stating the same claim ofdiscrimination ‘based [ ] on sex,’ a claim cognizable under Title VII”and therefore eligible for adjudication under the 1614 process.155Significantly, because Macy was decided by the full Commissionrather than the EEOC’s Office of Federal Operations, the decision isbinding on all executive departments and federal agencies notwith-bases, such as sexual orientation . . . .” Id.

In reachingthis conclusion, the EEOC relies on a gender-stereotyping theory of sexdiscrimination whereby notions that men should be physically, emo-tionally, and romantically attracted only to women, and that womenshould be physically, emotionally, and romantically attracted only tomen, are deemed discriminatory.158The guidance takes the form of an EEOC management directiveissued shortly after the Macy decision.159  After listing various federalcourt rulings and agency determinations permitting LGB persons tocontest employment discrimination on a gender-stereotyping theory ofsex discrimination, the management directive states that “lesbian, gayand bisexual employees [of the federal government] who believe theyhave been discriminated against because of their sexual orientationshould be counseled that they have a right to file a complaint under the1614 process, because they may have experienced sex discrimina-tion.”160  The directive goes on to assert that “if a lesbian, gay, or bisex-ual employee [of the federal government] files a complaint under the1614 process and the agency rejects the complaint as failing to state aclaim of sex discrimination, the agency should ensure that it providesthe employee with the appropriate notice of right to appeal” the thresh-156.

Of course, if a complainant wants tofile his or her complaint solely under the Executive Order or solelyunder the 1614 process, the individual is free to do so.”162The EEOC’s management directive is not binding on all executivedepartments and federal agencies in the same way as Macy, however.Indeed, until the full Commission has cause to decide a case in whichan LGB federal employee has attempted to state a claim for sex discrim-ination under the 1614 process on the theory that LGB-oriented dis-crimination is a form of impermissible gender-stereotyping, the extentof Executive Order 11478’s protections for LGB federal employees willremain uncertain.163If President Obama were to amend Executive Order 11478 toinclude gender identity and sexual orientation as subcategories of theexisting “sex” classification,164 this would not only serve to affirm theEEOC’s decision in Macy v. Holder and bring doctrinal consistency tothe order’s text, but would also proactively advance the notion that dis-crimination on the basis of sexual orientation is itself a form of sexdiscrimination actionable under Title VII.165  Once the President is onrecord as supporting an expansive interpretation of Title VII’s “sex”provision to include instances of sexual orientation discrimination,LGB federal employees presumably would be inclined to forego theiragencies’ internal grievance procedures in favor of attempting to obtainrelief under the more robust 1614 process, and the EEOC likely wouldfeel emboldened to issue a Macy-style ruling in regards to sexual orien-tation, thereby rendering all forms of LGBT-related employment dis-crimination eligible for adjudication under the 1614 process.Amending Executive Order 11478 in this manner, moreover,would signal President Obama’s support for a burgeoning movementwithin the federal judiciary whereby LGBT-oriented employment dis-161.

An Executive Order Protecting Private Sector LGBT WorkersEmployed by Federal ContractorsAs originally promulgated by President Johnson, Executive Order11246 prohibited federal contractors from discriminating on the basisof race, creed, color, or national origin.166  The order provides that “allGovernment contracting agencies shall include in every Governmentcontract hereafter entered into the following provisions: ‘During theperformance of this contract, the contractor agrees as follows: (1) Thecontractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant foremployment because of race, creed, color, or national origin.’”167  Theorder stipulates that “the contractor will include the [relevant nondis-crimination] provisions . . . in every subcontract or purchase order . . .so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or ven-dor [with whom the federal contractor does business].”168  The Secre-tary of Labor is given responsibility for enforcing the order, and thepenalties for noncompliance range from public censure, to a recom-mendation to the EEOC that appropriate civil proceedings be insti-tuted under Title VII, to a recommendation to the Department ofJustice that appropriate criminal proceedings be instituted for the fur-nishing of false information, to suspension or cancellation of the under-lying contract, to being declared ineligible for any future federalcontracts.169The order was amended in 1967 to include sex and religion amongfederal contractors’ prohibited bases for employment discrimina-tion.170  President Johnson noted that “Congress, by enacting Title VIIof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, enunciated a national policy of equalemployment opportunity in private employment, without discrimina-tion because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin” such that“[i]t is desirable that the equal employment opportunity programs pro-vided for in Executive Order 11246 expressly embrace discriminationon account of sex” or religion.171166.

Like ENDA, Title VII provides workers witha single means of contesting systemic employment discrimination, i.e., filing a complaintwith the EEOC.  Thus, an LGBT-inclusive amendment to Executive Order 11246 wouldprovide the federal government with an additional means of combating LGBT-relatedemployment discrimination even if the EEOC and federal courts were to one day reach aconsensus that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity isinherently a form of sex discrimination actionable under Title VII.\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\N\\NDE\\29-1\\NDE104.txt unknown Seq: 34 27-APR-15 10:05166 NOTRE DAME JOURNAL OF LAW, ETHICS & PUBLIC POLICY [Vol. 29a manner consistent with Macy v. Holder193 while proactively advancingthe related proposition that sexual orientation discrimination is itself aform of sex discrimination predicated on LGB individuals’ failure toconform to gender stereotypes.Amending Executive Order 11246 in this manner would signalPresident Obama’s support for a burgeoning movement within the fed-eral judiciary whereby LGBT-oriented employment discrimination isregarded as actionable sex discrimination under Title VII.  Whereas, atpresent, only a handful of federal courts permit openly LGBT workersto state cognizable sex discrimination claims, President Obama’s issu-ance of an LGBT-inclusive amendment to Executive Order 11246would likely prove influential in persuading additional courts to extendemployment protections to LGBT workers via the “sex” classification ofTitle VII.  In this way, President Obama would provide explicit status-based protections to private sector LGBT workers employed by federalcontractors, while at the same time providing an impetus for federalcourts to permit all private sector workers, regardless of whether theyhappen to be employed by a federal contractor, to contest LGBT-related employment discrimination as actionable sex discriminationunder Title VII.CONCLUSIONJohn Boehner recently declared there is “no way” ENDA will passthe House during the 113th Congress.194  While Speaker Boehner andhis colleagues would have the public believe their opposition is predi-cated on ENDA’s potential to elicit frivolous lawsuits, increase regula-tory burdens, and undermine religious freedoms, a closer examinationof the proffered rationales confirms that they are as likely to be moti-vated by anti-LGBT animus as they are sincerely-held concerns regard-ing free enterprise and religious liberty.  For these legislators, noamount of revisions to ENDA’s substantive provisions would be suffi-cient to win their support because they fundamentally disagree with thebill’s basic premise that LGBT persons are deserving of workplaceprotections.President Obama, therefore, should act unilaterally and issue twoexecutive orders providing meaningful employment protections toLGBT workers.

Moreover, amending theorder in this manner would serve to affirm the EEOC’s 2012 decision inMacy v. Holder, which found that discrimination on the basis of an indi-vidual’s transgender status is per se actionable under Title VII as a formof sex discrimination, while proactively advancing the related proposi-tion that sexual orientation discrimination is itself a form of sex dis-crimination predicated on LGB individuals’ failure to conform togender stereotypes.Historically, federal courts have been inclined to dismiss sex dis-crimination claims brought by openly LGBT workers for fear these indi-viduals were attempting to bootstrap sexual orientation and genderidentity protections into Title VII.  Within the last few years, however, asmall but significant number of courts have allowed openly LGBT per-sons to contest employment discrimination on a gender-stereotypingtheory of sex discrimination.  The inclusion of gender identity and sex-ual orientation within Executive Order 11478’s existing “sex” classifica-tion would signal President Obama’s support for this more expansiveunderstanding of sex discrimination.Separately, amending Executive Order 11246 to include genderidentity and sexual orientation as subcategories of the existing “sex”classification would provide explicit employment protections to the500,000 LGBT individuals working for federal contractors while at thesame time encouraging federal courts to adopt an LGBT-inclusive inter-pretation of Title VII’s “sex” classification that would extend employ-ment protections to all private sector LGBT workers, not just thoseemployed by federal contractors.  Although President Obama is ostensi-bly concerned that such an order would lead to accusations of executiveoverreach while at the same time inciting additional congressionalopposition to ENDA, House Republicans have already indicated thatthey have no intention of allowing a floor vote on ENDA and PresidentObama need not be overly concerned by the prospect of conservativecriticism now that he is in his second term.\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\N\\NDE\\29-1\\NDE104.txt unknown Seq: 36 27-APR-15 10:05",

    "abstract": "The United States workforce includes an estimated 5.4 million lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (“LGBT”) persons. Because no federal statute explicitly prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, employers may discriminate against LGBT workers with impunity, and numerous studies have confirmed that LGBT-related employment discrimination is rampant. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (“LGB”) individuals experience sexual orientation-based employment discrimination at staggering rates: 8% to 17% have been fired or denied employment, 7% to 41% have been verbally or physically harassed by coworkers, and 10% to 19% have been unfairly compensated in terms of pay or benefits. Transgender persons experience gender identity-based employment discrimination at even greater rates: 47% have been fired or denied employment, 78% have been verbally or physically harassed by coworkers, and 7% have been physically assaulted at work. Federal action to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, therefore, is not only warranted, but urgently needed to redress widespread bias against LGBT individuals",
