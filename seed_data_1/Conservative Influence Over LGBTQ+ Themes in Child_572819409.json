    "fullText": "Research Proposal: Conservative Influence Over LGBTQ+ ThemesIn Children’s AnimationBy Talia BernsteinDecember 2022Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the appearance of LGBTQ+ content and characters in American-made animated cartoons targeted toward middle school-aged children and adolescents. During this same period, there has been increased backlash from right-wing conservative groups, with anti-LGBTQ+ organizations calling for the boycott and cancellation of children’s shows that feature queer content. I intend to look at the past and current state of LGBTQ+ representation in kids’ animated cartoon shows, analyzing how increased queer visibility may heighten the chances of a show being canceled by conservative organizations. To answer this question, I’ll be looking at the amount of influence these conservative organizations have had over children’s media in the past and using this data to hypothesize the future of LGBTQ+ representation in children’s animation.\tNarrativeIntroduction:LGBTQ+ representation in media is crucial in helping queer youth to discover and accept their own gender identity and romantic preference/sexual orientation, as well as in helping people who do not identify as LGBTQ+ to understand and accept their queer peers. Because of the way our society has been constructed, heteronormativity becomes ingrained in children’s brains as soon as they are able to comprehend gender and sexuality. This can be extremely damaging to a person’s view of themselves and of others. Queer content, characters, and relationships in children’s animated cartoon TV shows are important because they can help combat these harmful biases by allowing LGBTQ+ themes to become normalized in the eyes of young viewers. However, many conservative groups are opposed to queer representation in children’s media and have organized efforts against it. I plan to research how, based on censorship efforts in the past, current LGBTQ+ representation in American cartoons meant for middle school-aged children could be affected by the efforts of conservative anti-LGBTQ+ organizations, and what this could mean for queer representation in the future.Research Question:How much control do conservative organizations have over popular media content, specifically regarding LGBTQ+ and queer representation in animated TV shows marketed toward middle school-aged children?Background Information:Historically, American cartoons have always been innately queer. Early Hollywood animation featured characters who appeared not to be restricted by the confines of gender, as well as characters who cross-dressed and acted romantically toward other characters of the same gender. A great example of this is Looney Tunes cartoon icon Bugs Bunny, who consistently appeared dressed as a woman and was famous for kissing other male characters. While this was originally done purely for comedic value, it is undeniably queer. One of the most famous drag queens of all time, RuPaul, once stated that Bugs Bunny was his/her “first introduction to drag” (“How Queer Characters Have Evolved in Children’s Animation | Movies Insider”). Despite this, the queerness of these characters was never acknowledged as canon and therefore could never be classified as true LGBTQ+ representation. As time progressed and animation focused more on marketing to a young demographic, the gender of popular cartoon characters and the romantic interactions between them became much less fluid. However, things have changed since the mid-20th century.In the early 2000s and 2010s, popular American cable television networks marketed toward children 7-14 years old, such as Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, began to introduce overtly queer themes into their animated shows. Some examples of these popular kids’ TV shows that feature queer themes, characters, and/or relationships include Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and more recently, The Owl House and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power. Certain characters in these shows did not become canonically queer until several years after the series aired. Even then, there were multiple shows developed around the same time, such as Gravity Falls and The Legend of Korra, that featured queer-coded characters, or characters implied but never actually confirmed to be queer. Nevertheless, the 21st century marked the beginning of a shift towards more LGBTQ+ representation in kids’ animation (“How Queer Characters Have Evolved in Children’s Animation | Movies Insider”).Children aged 7-14 at this time consisted primarily of members of Generation Z: those born from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s. Therefore, members of this generation were approximately middle school-aged when queer themes started to become more prevalent in mainstream media. There is strong evidence that exposure to non-heteronormative conceptualizations of gender, romantic preference, and sexual orientation during such a crucial developmental stage in life, not only physically but mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, has significantly impacted Gen Z’s development and understanding of gender and sexuality (It Gets Better Project; Romano; Samer and Whittington). According to a study by Gallup, nearly 1 in 5 Gen Z-ers identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community (Jones). The presence of queer themes in media throughout their childhood and adolescence has allowed members of Generation Z to learn to be more accepting of people of different genders and sexual/romantic orientations.It is now easier than ever before for young people to discuss these topics; what may have seemed taboo to earlier generations has now become much more normalized. Gen Z is among the first generations in modern American history to be taught through popular entertainment media that it is socially acceptable to identify as a part of the LGBTQ+ community (Jones; Lang). This recent trend has encouraged young people to open up to their peers about gender and sexual orientation rather than shying away from the topic in fear of ostracization. Growing LGBTQ+ representation in entertainment media, specifically in animated cartoons, has helped numerous youths to realize their own queerness and come to accept these traits in others.However, this phenomenon has begun to cause panic among right-wing conservatives. Much of the homophobia that has persisted in American culture can be traced back to conservative religious values that are deeply ingrained into our country’s society and history (Focus on the Family; “How Queer Characters Have Evolved in Children’s Animation | Movies Insider”). With the creation and development of the film industry in the early 1900s came rules and regulations pertaining to the censorship of “inappropriate content,” a major part of which included homosexuality. In 1930, Hollywood implemented the Motion Picture Production Code, or the Hays Code: a set of industry guidelines meant to make films and television shows “presentable” and “safe” for the public (“Hays Code”). Although it was replaced by the MPAA Film Rating System in the mid-1960s, which made the transition from censoring content completely to rating its suitability for certain audiences, it seems that the sentiment behind the creation of this code seems to remain with many conservative Americans.There are currently widespread efforts and campaigns in place to get parents to boycott certain television shows, and even whole networks, simply because they contain LGBTQ+ content (Focus on the Family; One Million Moms). The rise in queer content and characters in popular kid’s cartoons, as described above, has particularly outraged conservative Americans because of the enormous influence that popular media has been observed to have on children. With increased representation has come increased backlash, especially with the recent introduction of a national “Don’t Say Gay” bill in mid-October (Yurcaba and Valle). The increasing political polarization of the United States means that while the LGBTQ+ community has experienced tremendous gains in the past decade, discrimination is as rampant as ever.Method and Product:I plan to research and analyze the evolution of queer themes in children’s animation in America throughout history. I’ll be focusing specifically on the increase of queer themes in cartoons targeted toward middle school-aged kids so far over the course of the 21st century. I will then look at the causes and effects of backlash against LGBTQ+ representation in media throughout history and collect data on the effectiveness of past and present conservative efforts to censor queer content in children’s television. I will gather this information from scholarly articles, books, magazines, newspapers, popular media articles and videos, and various animated television shows. The results of this research will come in the form of an essay in which I’ll include a thorough synthesis and analysis of the knowledge that I accumulate throughout this process.Expected Results:\tI expect the results of my research to confirm that with increased queer representation in children’s media comes increased conservative backlash and censorship efforts. Because the entertainment industry is driven by profits, anything that impacts profits will have influence over media content. Based on this knowledge, I expect to find that conservative anti-LGBTQ+ organizations and parent groups have had a considerable amount of influence over television content in the past because the primary television media outlets at the time, network broadcasting and basic cable TV, relied on advertisement placements by companies for profits. However, with the rise of streaming services during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, I suspect that these organizations have and will continue to have less influence over media content because they are owned by private corporations that rely on subscribers, not advertisements, for profits. This means that children’s shows will be more difficult for parent groups to cancel, regardless of whether or not they feature queer characters. Thus, I expect to see a trend toward more LGBTQ+ content, characters, and relationships in the future.Conclusion:\tThe recent increase in LGBTQ+ content in entertainment media, specifically in children’s animation, has increased empathy and acceptance among young people and has helped them to better understand themselves and others. I plan to research the effect of backlash by anti-LGBTQ organizations against kids’ cartoons that feature queer representation, and what this could mean for the future of queer visibility. I will gather historical data on LGBTQ+ themes in entertainment media, compare this to recent trends, and look at this information in the context of censorship efforts. I expect to confirm through this research that despite anti-LGBTQ+ efforts,queer content is, and will continue to become, increasingly present in popular children’s animation.BudgetThis project relies primarily on researching the content of animated television shows and media responses to this content; thus, research funding needs will be focused primarily on hourly wages. I request a $15 hourly pay, in accordance with the California State minimum wage, as compensation for my time and research efforts. I plan to work on this research for fifteen hours a week for six weeks, with wages adding up to $1350 in total. Most of this research can be done on a personal computer or in the LMU library, so there would be no need to create a travel expense budget. Additional funds may be necessary to buy books that are unavailable for free online or in the library, or to potentially purchase subscriptions to streaming services in order to watch certain animated shows, as many cartoons that feature LGBTQ+ content are behind a paywall. I anticipate needing to purchase 2-3 books, most likely $50-$100 each (that are unavailable to access from the LMU library), to complete my research. I will determine which, if any, additional books are necessary once I begin my initial research. Because I already hold subscriptions to many of today’s popular streaming services, I anticipate only needing to purchase subscriptions to 1-2 additional streaming services at most. Average monthly costs for streaming services are approximately $7-$20, so I would need at most $80 in total to purchase subscriptions to necessary streaming services over the course of my six-week research period. Because costs may vary depending on the particular books and/or streaming services that I determine to be necessary through the course of my research, I request to be granted $500 in funds, in addition to the hourly wage, to cover these costs. I will document exactly what these funds are used for and when, and include this information in my final research essay to ensure that no funds are used for anything besides the relevant research of this topic.TimelineResearch Topic/Activity\tWeek 1\tWeek 2\tWeek 3\tWeek 4\tWeek 5\tWeek 6Backlash/censorship efforts against LGBTQ+ content in American media throughout history\t\t\t\t\t\tOther previous works and studies conducted to analyze queer themes in media\t\t\t\t\t\tAnimated children’s TV shows that include queer themes (1900-2000)\t\t\t\t\t\tAnimated children’s TV shows that include queer themes (2000-2022)\t\t\t\t\t\tPublic response to the recent rise in LGBTQ+ representation in media (2000-2022)\t\t\t\t\t\tCompile and analyze data\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWrite final research paper\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWorks CitedBrennan, Joseph.
