INTRODUCTIONThe year is 1938 and New Jersey residents have just turned on theirradios to hear Herbert George (“H.G.”) Wells broadcast fake news bulletinsthat warn of an alien invasion.1 What the listeners do not seem to realize isthat Wells is performing a radio adaptation of his science-fiction novel, TheWar of the Worlds.2 What results is nationwide hysteria that causes a flurry ofphone calls from anxious listeners to police stations, newspaper offices, andother radio stations with fears of an imminent Martian maraud—a predictableresult of a population believing without seeing.3 Fast forward to the 21stcentury, and now, even seeing is no longer believing; citizens can no longer* Sergio E.

DEEP DIVING INTO DEEPFAKESAudiovisual manipulation is by no means a novel concept; however,the newest stage in its evolutionary journey incorporates an added layer oftechnological advancements that makes its existence not only morewidespread, but also more intricate.32 In order to develop a better sense of thethreats that deepfakes pose and the manners in which deepfakes may bemitigated, it is important to understand exactly where deepfakes came from,how they are made, and why their availability is growing.33A. Remember to RewindSociety’s understanding of deepfakes has become popularized at atime when “fake news”—or, as some define it, false, inaccurate, or misleadinginformation designed, presented, and promoted to further interests—is frontand center.34 It is important to note that fake news serves as an umbrella termunder which misinformation and disinformation exist35—misinformationbeing the unintentional furtherance of misleading or inaccurate informationand disinformation being its intentional equivalent.36 While the root of theseconcepts are ancient, social media structures and the rise of deepfakes havehelped these concepts branch out into a post-truth society where “objective30.

This may not be a problem on its own, but recentresearch suggests that not all content spreads at the same rate.Research from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)suggests that false content spreads up to six times faster than factualcontent on social media sites and false news stories are seventypercent more likely to be shared.8074.

Nuñez, supra note 35, at 786.2022] DEEPFAKES AND THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY 261Importantly, the hurdles on the path to mastering the creation anddissemination of deepfake media are not the technical skills required to createdeepfakes, per se, but rather the attainability of processors with sufficientcapacity to run large programs.81 Because GANs make outputs a product ofinputs, the greater its data training set, the easier it is for the program todevelop a credible piece of deepfake media.82 This requires that a creatorobtain a graphic processing unit (“GPU”) sizeable enough, and with a vastamount of memory, to work through the large quantities of photos, videos, oraudios of the target.83 More specifically, to perform deep learning, train aneural network to reconstruct patterns effectively, and ultimately createdeepfake media, one would need a GPU greater than those found incommercially available laptops (at least as of 2019), and would require anunderstanding of “torrenting, path configuration, file structures, andapplication versioning.”84In reality, to create an effective deepfake, a user need only a computercomparable to a high-quality gaming laptop that retails for well under$3,000—a far smaller technological obstacle for gamers and avid computerhobbyists.85 In fact, even that may not be entirely necessary, as anyone withbasic computer skills has the means by which to create deepfakes.86 Whatmakes this heightened accessibility of creative processes possible is the rise ofmore readily available software in the open market and internet tutorials onthe deepfake-media-making process that, together, work to lift technologicalconstraints.87 For example, FakeApp is a relatively accessible program thatdoes not require complex equipment and creates deepfake media in as little aseight to twelve hours.88Today, more programs are being cheaply sold, with some of the GPUsneeded to make deepfake media selling for as low as $160 USD.89 For thosethat do not have the financial means or interests to purchase, these types of81.

Rather, it is the dignitaryharm inflicted on the subject herself.”103 Greater still is the disproportionateimpact that deepfakes can have when used to blackmail people withinvulnerable populations, like the LGBTQ+ community, that oftentimes findthemselves hiding in the shadows.104 The concept of data exploitation for thepurposes of blackmailing or harming the LGBTQ+ community is not a newone, and historical data, in addition to modern concerns over dating apps,seems to suggest that the threat is magnified for such communities.105This kind of data exploitation is very much in line with the morearchaic forms of data exploitation that have threatened the LGBTQ+community throughout various points in history.106 During the height of theNazi regime, the Gestapo raided sex research institutions and confiscatedextensive lists containing the names and addresses of local homosexuals.107Those listed became the targets of the Reich Central Office for the Combattingof Homosexuality and Abortion.108 The Nazis arrested over 100,000 men ashomosexuals and took some of these men to concentration camps where they99.

Prodigy Services Co.,161 Congress members grew concerned that thecourt’s ruling would disincentivize the moderation of offensive content postedto internet service providers by third parties.162 As a result, Congress passedthe Communications Decency Act and included in it, Section 230, whichoffers internet service providers a broad shield of immunity from liability formoderating too much or too little of their third party users’ speech.163However, the absence of narrow language in Section 230’s immunityclauses has come to be interpreted in a manner that is so broad that it hascreated yet another problem—immunity remains available even if an internetservice provider intentionally encourages the posting of harmful content.164 Infact, when it has been applied, this expansive immunity has allowed internetservice providers to republish content with the knowledge that it violates thelaw, alter their platform to prevent the capture of criminals, and allow the saleof illegal or dangerous products.165 For example, Grindr, a dating appmarketed primarily to the gay community, often sees fake profiles on itsplatform wherein a user appropriates the images, whether more commonplaceor intimate, of another (“catfishing”).166 Recently, one of Grindr’s users,Matthew Herrick, sued the company for the negligent design of its applicationafter Herrick’s ex-boyfriend began impersonating him on the app by creatinga fake profile in his name, spreading his nude photographs, and sharing rape157.

Grindr, LLC172 can be adapted to illustratethe point in action.173 User A of a social media platform either creates orobtains a deepfake that impersonates User B, and depicts B in some intimateact without their knowledge or consent.174 User A uploads the harmful oroffensive deepfake to a social media platform, where the content spreads andgets shared.175 Upon discovery of the deepfake content, B requests that theplatform remove it on account of the professional, reputational andpsychological harm that the synthetic media creates.176 The platform neverremoves the content, it continues to spread and harm B, and B sues theplatform.177 Under the current framework of Section 230, it would beunreasonable to expect that the adapted facts would yield a conclusiondifferent than the one in Herrick, despite the platform’s actual knowledge ofthe harmful or offensive nature of the content in question and of the damagethat it causes.178 Herein lies the heart of the problem, worse even, when the167.

Garon, Professor and former Dean at Nova SoutheasternUniversity’s Shepard Broad College of Law, has noted, there are two ways inwhich Section 230 can be modified to strike a more equitable balance betweenthe two interests.187First, once content has been determined by a court to be libelous orharassing, the [Internet Service Provider] should have an obligationto remove that content immediately upon notification.
