    "fullText": "3Amicus Curiae Issue 85 Spring 2011The county court decision in Hall & Preddy v Bull[2011] EW Misc 2 (CC) provides a further exampleof judicial consideration of the interplay of religionand sexual orientation discrimination, following such casesas McFarlane v Relate Avon [2010] EWCA Civ 880 and Ladelev London Borough of Islington [2009] EWCA Civ 1357 (whichdealt respectively with religious objections to providing sextherapy and civil partnership ceremonies to homosexuals).The judgments in the latter cases together with suchexamples as Chaplin v Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital NHSFoundation Trust [2010] ET 1702886/2009 and Eweida vBritish Airways [2010] EWCA Civ 80 (which both held thatprohibitions regarding wearing crucifixes were notdiscriminatory), and the furore over the threat to Catholicadoption agencies during the passage of the Equality Act2006 (with many subsequently closing), caused leadingclerics to criticise an imbalance in discrimination law andopine that the religious rights of the Christian communityare being treated with disrespect (see, eg Daily TelegraphLetters, March 28, 2010; Montgomery, J W, “Religious‘irrationality’ and civil liberties”, (2010) 82 Amicus Curiae,12).THE CASEHall & Preddy v Bull is a rare discrimination case involvingthe provision of services and shows that an Englishman andEnglishwoman’s home is not necessarily their castle. Mrand Mrs Bull had for many years run a private hotel near StIves in Cornwall. They are devout Christians and hadsought to run their hotel on Christian principles, with textson some of the walls and the statement on their onlinebooking form that “Here at Chymorvah we have few rules,but please note, that out of a deep regard for marriage weprefer to let double accommodation to heterosexualmarried couples only – thank you”.Mr Hall and Mr Preddy are civil partners, who lived inBristol. They wanted to go on a short break, with their petdog, to Cornwall in September 2008 and Mr Preddy madea telephone booking for two nights in a double room at theChymorvah Private Hotel, having seen that it was a dog-friendly establishment. As the booking was by telephone,they did not see the restriction on who could book doublerooms and Mrs Bull, who took the booking, did not,contrary to her usual practice because she was feelingunwell, let them know of the restriction. The first MssrsHall and Preddy knew of it was when they turned up at thehotel. Their protestation that they were civil partners didnot help them, and the refusal to let them have a doubleroom, while not done in a demeaning manner according toMr Preddy, took place in the public reception area in thepresence of other guests.One wonders as to the content of the discussion at thispoint. Has society’s quest to “pigeon hole” its membersled to a situation where anyone who is not overtlyheterosexual must be subjected to questioning as to theirsexual orientation? Would Mrs Bull have questioned twofemales in the same way – perhaps, because of her religiousconviction, she would have felt compelled to do so. Butwhat of a situation where two guests who are in a same sexrelationship arrived but having read the notice on thewebpage page, decided to ask for a double room with twinbeds so as to save any embarrassment – would these havebeen questioned? The evidence as to this during thehearing was unclear, but the judge, although initiallyuncertain, was satisfied with the amended defence thatsuch rooms would be let if available (although noting thatif an unmarried couple – heterosexual or homosexual –wished to embark on a “sexually fulfilling weekend”, thehotel policy “allows them so to do albeit in the confines ofa smaller bed” (at para [34])).Having gone on to find a different hotel, and had theirdeposit refunded, Messrs Hall and Preddy sought adeclaration and damages under the then extant Equality Act(Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007 (SO Regs 2007).A question of religion ororientation: Hall & Preddy vBull and the possible effect ofthe Equality Act 2010by James Hand and Pat FeastTHE LAW (AT THE TIME)Regulation 4 of the SO Regulations 2007 held that it wasunlawful, when providing goods, facilities or services to thepublic, to discriminate against a person by, among otherthings, refusing to provide those services or by providingthose services on different terms (see now s 29 EqualityAct 2010). This was not at issue in this case which wasargued solely on whether the Bulls’ action constituteddirect or indirect discrimination (and whether such aconstruction was compatible with the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights).Regulation 3(1) of the SO Regulations 2007 held that aperson (“A”) discriminates against another(“B”) if, ongrounds of the sexual orientation of B or any other personexcept A, A treats B less favourably than he treats or wouldtreat others (in cases where there is no material differencein the relevant circumstances). The argument for thedefence in the present case was that the discrimination wasnot on grounds of sexual orientation but had “everything todo with ‘sex.’” Indeed, in 1996 the hotel had appeared innewspaper stories because the Bulls refused double roomsto unmarried heterosexual couples; and the twin-beddedrooms were available to people regardless of their maritalstatus or sexual orientation. However, Judge Rutherforddisagreed with that analysis and considered that the Bullswere discriminating on the basis of marital status. Pointingto Regulation 3(4) of the SO Regulations 2007, whichspecify that when making the comparison the fact that oneperson is a civil partner while the other is married is not tobe treated as a material difference, he held that the onlyconclusion which he could draw was that the refusal toallow them to occupy the double room was because of theirsexual orientation. To put it another way, not that he usedsuch language, “but for” the claimants’ sexual orientation –if they were heterosexual and thus married (any differencesbetween marriage and civil partnership not being materialfor the purposes of the Regulationss) – they would not havebeen less favourably treated.In case he was in error, Judge Rutherford then went onto consider indirect discrimination. The defendants hadaccepted that the restriction on the occupation of doublerooms constituted a “provision, criterion or practice”which was applied to the claimants and equally to personsnot of their sexual orientation (reg 3(3)(a)). Theycontested, however, that the restriction placed persons ofthe claimants’ sexual orientation at a disadvantagecompared to some or all others (where there is no materialdifference in the relevant circumstances) and further that,if it did, that they could not reasonably justify therestriction by reference to matters other than B’s sexualorientation (reg 3(3)(b) & (d)). Judge Rutherford,however, held that it was clear that homosexuals as a groupwere disadvantaged by the practice and that to allow thejustification would create a class of persons whose viewsrendered them exempt from the discrimination legislationand that such a defence would be too wide.THE EUROPEAN CONVENTIONArticle 9(1) of the European Convention on HumanRights establishes a general right to freedom of “thought,conscience and religion” which cannot be restricted by thestate; however Article 9(2) establishes that the right to‘manifest’ one’s religion or belief in ‘worship, teaching,practice and observance’ may be restricted. Article 9 can beinvoked alongside other Convention rights and thus, forexample, Article 10 can be considered if there arerestrictions placed on religious expression and Article 8 maybe relevant if any restriction interferes with the individual’sprivate life. If the issue is in connection to the manifestationof religion, the court is likely to focus on Article 9 as it wasin the case before us. Judge Rurtherford queried whetherthe running of the hotel along Christian principles could bedescribed as manifesting one’s religion but came to theconclusion that it could. However, the Christian religioncould be regarded as a forward thinking and tolerant faithand does it therefore require that marital status can only beachieved via a heterosexual marriage contract? (This issomething which is due to come under much scrutiny in thenext few years). Does the manifestation of the religionrequire this observance? In Eweida v British Airways plc [2010]EWCA Civ 80, for example, it was successfully argued thatthe wearing of a crucifix was not indirect discriminationbecause, inter alia, the wearing of a crucifix was not anessential element of the Christian faith.Irrespective of these questions as to Article 9(1), JudgeRutherford held that such manifestation was in any casesubject to Article 9(2) and the SO Regulations 2007 wereboth a necessary and proportionate intervention by thestate to protect the rights of others. By contrast, he did notbelieve that the Bull’s Article 8 rights to respect for theirprivate and family life were infringed as the regulations didnot affect the private part of the hotel where they lived(their privacy in the guest areas inevitably being affected bytheir choice to run part of their home as an hotel) but if hewere wrong then, again, the right could properly be limitedas the regulations could be deemed both necessary toprotect the convention rights of the claimants and to do soproportionately.TEMPORA MUTANTUR…?As Judge Rutherford points out, social attitudes havechanged in recent decades and it was not so very long agothat the genuinely held beliefs of the defendants wouldhave been accepted as normal by society. Someestablishments may have turned a blind eye to unmarriedcouples sharing a room, but it would not then have been awidespread practice. Such was also the era of signs outsideboarding houses stating “no blacks, no dogs, no Irish.”Since those days we have had a raft of equality legislationalongside changes in social attitudes.However, even before the advent of equality legislation,innkeepers were under a duty not to refuse guests if4Amicus Curiae Issue 85 Spring 20115Amicus Curiae Issue 85 Spring 2011deemed to be “travellers” rather than lodgers or boarders.This common law duty had been in existence for around500 years and the relevant definition of an inn or hotel cannow be found in section 1(1) of the Hotel Proprietors Act1956: an establishment held out by the proprietor asoffering food, drink and, if so required, sleepingaccommodation, without special contract, to any travellerpresenting himself who appears able and willing to pay areasonable sum for the services and facilities provided andwho is in a fit state to be received. Thus when, inConstantine v Imperial London Hotels Ltd [1944] 1 KB 693,Mr Constantine, an afro-Caribbean British subject andman of high character, was turned away from the Imperialhotel despite having booked a room and paid the deposit,the hotel company was liable, albeit only in nominaldamages. However, if there had been a special contract –such as is the case with boarding houses, lodgings andguesthouses – then there would have been no duty. Thediscrimination legislation expressly included boardinghouses within its remit (eg s 20(2)(b) Race Relations Act1976, reg 4(2)(b) SO Regs 2007) but allowed a limitedexception for small communal accommodation (eg s 22RRA 1976, reg 6(2) SO Regs 2007).THE EQUALITY ACT 2010Hall & Preddy v Bull and all the earlier cases took placeunder the original discrimination legislation, as will theappeal of the case due later this year. The new, unifying,Equality Act 2010 replicates much of the formerprovisions, with the definitions of direct and indirectdiscrimination appearing in sections 13(1) and 19, thestatement regarding the lack of materiality of the differencebetween marriage and civil partnership in section 23(3)and the prohibition of discrimination in providing servicesin section 29 (although the list of activities is no longerincluded) and the communal accommodation exception inSchedule 5. Within these provisions there has been verylittle change to the law.However, if a similar scenario to Hall & Preddy v Bulloccurred today the claimants could potentially takeadvantage of a significant change. Under section 45(1) ofthe Equality Act 2006, a person (“A”) discriminated againstanother (“B”) if on grounds of the religion or belief of B orof any other person except A (whether or not it is also A’sreligion or belief) A treated B less favourably than he treatedor would have treated others, whereas the unified directdiscrimination provision in the Equality Act 2010 (definedin s 13(1)) refers to less favourable treatment because of aprotected characteristic. There is in the new Act nolimitation with regard to the protected characteristic ofreligion preventing the religion in question from being thatof the discriminator. Accordingly, rather than it being aquestion of the interplay of sexual orientation and religion,and the possible imbalance therein decried by leadingclerics among others, the claim could now appear to takeplace solely based on the protected characteristic of religionas the less favourable treatment would be because of theviews of the defendants.James HandAssociate Senior Lecturer, School of Law, University of PortsmouthPat FeastSenior Lecturer, School of Law, University of Portsmouth",
