Ruiz-Resa, Granada/Spain  Connections between Education for Citizenship and Equality between Women and Men (Analysis  of  the  Claims  against  this  Subject  before  the  Spanish  Courts  and  their Rulings)1  Abstract: This paper seeks to analyse the debate on equality between women and men found in the claims against the subjects related to Education for Citizenship. These claims were resolved in the Spanish Supreme Court and High Courts of the Autonomous Communities. In this debate, there is a strong rejection of antidiscrimination law assumptions, namely that the different roles and social roles of women and men have a cultural and social base and it is unnatural, as evidenced by the concept of gender. But many appellants and judgments defend the difference between women and men as if it was informed  and  legitimated  on  human  nature.  Hence  gender  is  considered  an  ideology,  that  is,  a category of analysis by means of which the reality of true human nature can be concealed or distorted. But these arguments are opposed to recent legal reforms since they are questioning its normative value, by prioritizing certain moral principles against these laws. We are talking about the Organic Law for Effective Equality between Women and Men, the Law on Integrated Protection Measures against Gender Violence and the Law on Education. However their arguments are not fully justified. Keywords: Education for citizenship, equality, gender  I. Legal Context of Education for Citizenship and its connection with the equality of women and men  The Organic Law 2 / 2006 on Education and its Development Regulations (Royal Decrees 1513-1506,  1531-1506  and  1467-1407)  have  introduced  three  specific  subjects  known together as Education for Citizenship. They are taught in primary and secondary school. But there has been strong opposition which has resulted in the proliferation of lawsuits brought by many  parents,  through  which  they  have  demanded  the  annulment  of  certain  parts  of  the developing  legislation  of  the  subjects,  and  /  or  recognition  of  a  hypothetical  right  to conscientious objection to them. If we take into account the period between 2008 and 2009, there have been no less 817 judgments on this subject. Of all these judgments, 350 have referred, more or less directly, to the contents of the Education for Citizenship related to so-called gender ideology. During 2010, about 155 judgments have been given, among which 17 referred expressly to gender ideology.                                                             1 This text communication has been realised within the framework of the research Project “Multiculturalidad, Género y Derecho” (National Plan of R+D+I), reference DER 2009-08297 (Subprogramme JURI).  2 These  challenges  question  some  of  the  elements  that  define  today  the  principle  of equality between women and men and could ultimately affect the effectiveness of the rules implementing that principle. The analysis of the judgments on Education for Citizenship is important for two reasons: the first, more general, is the connection between education and the development of a more democratic society, which is based on the respect for human rights and principles such as pluralism, freedom or equality. The second, more specific, is that the many legal  actions  and appeals  brought  against the subjects  of  Education for Citizenship argue against certain contents and skills that would be learned in them. These contents and skills are directed to learning that the functions traditionally attributed to men and women are not natural. According to these functions, women deal with procreation and care of children, and men are the breadwinners. By contrast, those subjects convey that this division of labor has placed women in a situation of dependence and subordination to men, with an imbalance between their expectations, choice and implementation, as enjoyed by men, and this situation is  reversible  because  it  is  not  a  question  of  nature  but  responds  to  certain  socio-cultural conditioning.  Giving a conventional character to these roles, which is an aspect that has led to social science to distinguish between sex (a biological term), and gender used to describe socio-cultural aspects), has generated a profound rejection between the litigating parents, because, as they have indicated, this point of view conflicts with their moral and religious beliefs. In any case, it is important to note that these distinctions refer to those words sex and gender, have been taken in important international and EU laws, for example, Directive in 2004, which  incorporates  the  term  \"gender  equality\",  as  shown  in  paragraphs  7  and  16  of  its introduction; or the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, its acronym in English), adopted by the UN in 1979 and ratified by Spain in 1983. Its Article 5 provides that States take all appropriate measures to   “A)  modify  social and cultural patterns of conduct of  men and  women,  with a  view to achieving  the elimination  of  prejudices  and  customary  and  all  other  practices  which  are  based  on  the  idea  of  the inferiority or superiority of either sexes or on roles for men and women;  b) To ensure that family education includes a proper understanding of maternity as a social function and the recognition of the common responsibility of men and women in the upbringing and development of their children, on the understanding that the interest of the children is the primordial consideration in all cases. \"   The Spanish Law of Equality follows this Convention as well as the Nairobi Conference of 1985 or the Beijing Conference of 1995, which invite States to include gender perspective in 3 their programs and actions. This is a perspective which the European Commission suggests all EU member states should adopt. So the Spanish Law of Equality recognizes a new conception of equality and discrimination between men and women inspired by the distinction between natural and socio-cultural roles. It is a conception of equality that extends the borders of the socio-economic  equality  that  guided  the  intervention  of  the  Welfare  states,  which  had expanded, in turn, the borders of formal equality or equality before the law, recognized in the first legal texts of modern democracies. The current sense of equality between women and men  continues  and  widens  the  presuppositions  of  modern  anti-discrimination  law,  which originated in the legal measures to end racial discrimination in the US after the riots in the sixties of last century. It also contributed to the development of numerous concepts such as indirect discrimination. In any case, the antidiscrimination law marks a qualitative change for the demands of economic redistribution that accompanied the claims of class, to focus on social demands for recognition, bearing in mind the influence of cultural elements in the coexistence of democracies.  The Spanish government has followed the international and European law, to which it is linked. And this requires reinterpretation of Articles 9.2 and 14 of the SC. It can be said that democratic  countries  have  accepted  that  certain  functions  assigned  to  women  because  of gender have contributed to their subordination to men, and these functions cannot be justified by biology or the immovable natural order. Twentieth century social science has shown that they are mainly due to socio-cultural roles assigned to each gender. And these roles contradict the basic demands of justice and the very essence of modern democracies: the emancipation of individuals from those natural and social obstacles that prevent them from developing their autonomy. Nowadays, these obstacles are cultural as well. On the other hand, it must also be remembered that Spanish law has expressly recognized the link between democracy and education. This is a connection highlighted by Plato, Kant, Constant and Mill. Specifically, Article 27. 2 of the SC states that \"the objective of education shall  be  the  full  development  of  the  human  personality,  in  respect  for  the  democratic principles of coexistence and the basic rights and liberties\". And in paragraph 5 it says that the public  authorities  guaranties  \"the  right  of  all  to  education,  through  a  general  educational program,  with  the  effective  participation  of  all  the  sectors  affected  and  the  creation  of educational centers\". The regulations implementing this article, now embodied in the Organic Law 2 / 2006 on Education and its Development Regulations, has introduced Education for Citizenship. 4 In any case, the new Education Act follows the educational policy being developed in other Western democratic countries. This policy is within: a) Recommendation (2002) 12 of the  Committee  of  Ministers  to  member  States  of  the  Council  Europe  on  education  for democratic  citizenship  and  adopted  on  October  16;  b)  Recommendation  of  the  European Parliament and the Council of 18 December 2006 on key competences for lifelong learning, and c) Recommendation of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 April 2008 on the Establishment of the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning.   Concretely, Recommendation (2002) 12 Council of Europe considers that education for citizenship  should  be  a  priority  objective  of  educational  policy,  given  the  high  levels  of corruption,  racism,  xenophobia,  aggressive  nationalism,  intolerance  against  minorities, discrimination and social exclusion. And specifically, this recommendation also establishes a connection between Education for Citizenship and the guarantee of equality between women and men. It states \"Education for democratic citizenship is a factor of social cohesion, mutual understanding, intercultural and interfaith dialogue, and solidarity, which helps to promote the principle of equality between men and women.\"  Following these assumptions, the Council of Europe declared 2005 \"European Year of Citizenship through Education\", with the intention of promoting, among Member States, a set of  actions  that  encourage  responsible  citizenship.  In  this  context,  the  Council  of  Europe defines education for citizenship as the \"set of practices and activities designed to help all people, children, youth and adults to be better equipped to participate actively in democratic life, taking on and exercising their rights and responsibilities in society.\"  And as regards the European institutions, the recommendation of December 18, 2006 of the European Parliament and the Council states that education \"contributes to maintaining and renewing the common cultural heritage of society, and to learn fundamental social and civic values such as citizenship, equality, tolerance and respect, and is particularly important at a time when all Member States address the question of how to address the growing social and cultural diversity.\"  On the other hand, this recommendation on lifelong learning, encourages the acquisition of  skills  defined  \"as  a  combination  of  knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes  appropriate  to  the context.\"  Among  these  skills  are  the  so-called  \"social  and  civic  skills.\"  However,  the appellants have challenged that the subjects of Education for Citizenship can be directed to the acquisition of such skills: they consider it a manifestation of state indoctrination, when in fact it has been taken directly from this Recommendation, which includes a detailed and extensive description of those skills. And the Recommendation of the European Parliament 5 and the Council of 2008 set out that all subjects in general -which also includes the Education for  Citizenship-,  'target  not  only  the  acquisition  of  knowledge  but  also  skills  and competences”.  Furthermore, the so-called Lisbon strategy adopted by the EU has set Europe on the path to the knowledge economy, and this is a process where social inclusion and active responsible and democratic citizenship features prominently within the three objectives of the education systems and training, adopted by the European Council in March 2001. These objectives are quality,  access  and  openness  of  European  education  to  the  world.  In  this  context,  the educational  system  is  considered  the  most  important  tool  to  communicate  and  teach  the principles  of  equity,  inclusion  and  cohesion,  because  the  central  concern  of  European institutions is the elimination of socio-economic and political exclusion. Thus, the European concept of an active and responsible citizenship, which leads to the broad concept of education for citizenship, has inspired the current Spanish legislation, which seeks to meet the demand for equity and the inclusion of women in the educational system. Women have traditionally been excluded and absent from the exercise of citizenship. This law supports the connection between equality of men and women, democracy and education. This is the triad of elements which has aroused strong opposition shown by these appeals against the Education for Citizenship. But this connection has been recognized by other Spanish laws. Concretely, in Title I of the Organic Law of 2004 on Integrated Protection Measures against Gender  Violence,  Among  its  measures  are  those  to  raise  awareness,  prevent  and  detect violence, extending such measures to all educational levels, ie, Primary, Secondary schools and  universities,  and  urging  education  authorities  to  eliminate  gender  stereotypes  and discriminatory  school  materials.  It  also  entrusts  the  education  inspectorate  to  ensure compliance with its measures. In addition, the Organic Law of Equality has also introduced a set of guidelines in different Articles (23-25), relating to the integration of equality between women  and  men  in  education,  with  a  \"special\"  attention  in  curricula  and  all  stages  of education, emphasizing the elimination and rejection of sexist conduct and discrimination, and  stereotypes  involving  women  and  men,  with  special  attention  to  textbooks  and educational materials (art. 24. 2 b). Moreover, Article 15 lays down the mainstreaming of the principle of equal treatment between women and men in developing public policy, such as education, and Article 21 provides expressly that the autonomous administrations collaborate in guaranteeing the right to equality between women and men. Finally,  it  should  be  remembered,  in  regard  to  the  connection  between  education, democracy and equality of women and men, the Preamble to the Education Act includes, 6 among the aims of education, \"training in respect of fundamental rights and freedoms, and effective equality of opportunities for women and men, the recognition  of emotional and sexual diversity, and critical appraisal of inequalities, in order to overcome sexist conduct.\" It continues to assume the contents of the statement about the L. O. 1 / 2004. As it was passed before the LOIMH, the Education Act does not refer to it explicitly, but they are connected. This is the conclusion which the legislator brought about when it states that \"equal treatment and opportunities between women and men -as can be read in Article 4 of the LOIMH- is a principle that informs the legal system and as such, it shall be established and observed in the interpretation and application of legal rules. \"   II. Appeals against the Education for Citizenship in relation to equality between women and men  Despite  this  regulatory  background,  there  has  been  a  strong  resistance  to  Education  for citizenship, especially towards those contents that argue that the differences between men and women are not only due to nature. This challenge to Education for Citizenship is based on the denial that the set of rights and principles enshrined in the Constitution are considered a morality  that  all  citizens  must  respect.  And  such  a  rejection  is  based  on  the  following assumptions:  a)  the  state  cannot  impose  these  principles  because  then  it  would  be indoctrinating students; b) it cannot claim that legal rules constitute morality, because that would be to fall into positivism; c) if the values and rights that the legal rules establish are considered a minimum and beyond that there can be other moralities, then it is falling into relativism.  For  all  these  reasons,  the  appellant  parents  seek  the  recognition  of  their  right  to conscientious  objection  to  allow  their  children  no  to  study  the  subjects  of  Education  for Citizenship.  We  must  remember  that  Spanish  Constitution  only  recognizes  conscientious objection in relation to the obligation of compulsory military service, as reflected in Article 30.2, but in several judgments, the Constitutional Court (CC) has connected conscientious objection  to  ideological  freedom,  enshrined  in  Article  16.1,  although  CC  has  not  always followed its own doctrine on the matter. In any case, the Constitutional Court has maintained the doctrine established by two cases  in  1987,  in  which  the  connection  between  conscientious  objection  and  freedom  of thought and conscience was held not to be enough by itself to free the citizens from their legal duties.  It  requires  a  procedure  regulated  by  the  legislator.  At  the  moment,  there  is  no procedure  in  the  field  of  Education  for  Citizenship.  And  Art.  10  of  the  Charter  of 7 Fundamental  Rights  of  the  European  Union  has  indicated  that  the  right  to  conscientious objection must be in accordance with national laws governing its exercise, which requires enabling legislation to deploy its effects.  These assumptions explain the arguments of the lawsuits and appeals. To recapitulate, their arguments are that the State and / or regional governments are imposing an illegitimate indoctrination because: a) they impose a moral set of values, such as human rights, which are included in the Spanish Constitution and the international treaties signed by Spain; b) they impose positivism, because they consider that public morality is within a written text, that is, the Spanish Constitution; c) they impose relativism, since they support a plurality of moral standards that can exist in a democratic society; d) they impose individualism, since these subjects encourage students to develop a critical reasoning which allows them to choose as conscious individuals, independently of their families. Moreover (e) this legislation introduces the so-called “gender ideology”, which, as deduced from the arguments made by parents, would be characterized by stating that there are no distinctions between men and women and that all emotional and sexual orientations have the same value.  It is noteworthy to point out how the introduction into the curricula of the abilities to choose,  to  consider  alternatives  and  to  submit  them  to  ethical  analysis,  or  the  ability  to recognize and accept differences, are considered especially serious interferences of the state in the morality of the parents (although all these abilities have been established by the European recommendations, referred to above). These parents also consider that the competencies that foster empathy and solidarity with those suffering from discrimination, for example, for their sexual orientation, and to encourage the commitment to reverse the injustices that are related to the functions assigned to each sex, are also a serious interference. It seems that they do not accept that social and cultural behaviors connected with biological sex can come be due to anything other than nature, For example, they exclude the influence of socialization, and that humans can choose a sexual orientation or behavior as a man or woman other than those determined by their biological sex. They consider that this view of cultural-sexual behavior is an ideology because it denies human nature and the family relationships based on it, and they note that it also lacks scientific support and public consensus.  As for the so-called gender ideology, there is a concept developed by Catholic theorists, for whom gender is a construction that is unscientific and that hides from reality, which for them is the natural. In any case, gender ideology is seen as a construction resulting from a branch of feminism (gender feminism), steeped in postmodern philosophy, and with Judith Butler  as  its  most  important  representative.  However,  it  is  unclear  if  they  use  the  term 8 \"ideology\" in the Marxist sense (which would be a paradox, of course, among those who have always rejected it). But this is not the most pressing issue, but rather what they understand by nature. It is not exactly the biological, which is subject to the laws of necessity that science reveals, but something that coincides with what the natural law understands to be the nature of human  beings.  The  point  is  that  this  natural  law  is  also  considered  as  a  necessary  law, emanating  from  a  universal  legislator,  a  superior  being.  All  nature,  all  the  universe  is determined in its form and function under this Law that humans cannot alter –they can only alter  the  laws  that  they  themselves  create-.  Sex  and  its  social  role  are  considered  to  be determined in this way also. Science cannot discover such a normative order by its methods, but through other knowledge, such as philosophy or religion. This same concept of the natural order of the universe, which reflects the unchanging natural law explains a peculiarity of human rights, whose grounding is not individual freedom but the duties imposed by that order. In this way, rights exist to perform duties, not to contribute to freedom and individual self-realization.  At  this  point,  it  matters  little  that  the  influence  of  socio-cultural  aspects  (which  are conventional and can be changed) in the creation of sex-related behaviors does have scientific support.  In  addition,  endorsing  the  opponent  lacks  scientific  objectivity  that  devalues  the objectivity of his claims, and instead giving no importance to the scientific nature of their own claims, if an asymmetry which is contrary to the rules of dialectical discussion. Nevertheless, it may be useful to review the scientific studies that have helped to strengthen the hypothesis that  socio-cultural  factors  influence  in  human  identities,  including  their  sexual  identities. Thus,  for  a  reputed  international  sociologist  Manuel  Castells,  identity  is  a  sense-making process around a cultural attribute, or a related set of cultural attributes, which are given priority  over  other  sense  sources.  For  the  well-known  anthropologist  Clifford  Geertz,  the mind has a cultural nature and culture has a mental nature. According to Geertz, culture is, from a semiotic perspective, a web of significant plots in which the human being is embedded and that he himself has spun, hence the importance of words and discourses by means of which the others or we ourselves are introduced.  Moreover, as the psychologist Silvia Tubert has pointed out, the distinction between sex and gender is due not feminism, but to the behaviourist John Money, a specialist in child endocrinology and counselling sexologist, who in 1955 introduced the concepts of gender and gender identity to explain how individuals, like hermaphrodites, can build a sexual identity at odds with his or her body sex. For Money, gender role is the role that social biography, parent behavior and social environment play in relation to the sex assigned to the newborn.  9 In this regard, we should note that social psychologists say that the way others perceive us is a key element in shaping individual identities. And gender is articulated on notions such as identity and culture, although that does not mean that gender is a form of culture. But these notions have an emancipating potential useful in the field of ethics and philosophy as shown in the paradigm of justice, based on the recognition of others. This is a paradigm, which is defended  by  the  philosophers  Charles  Taylor  and  Axel  Honneth,  supports  the  claims  of communitarianism  and  multiculturalism  and  raises  the  recognition  of  others  to  the  basic content of justice.  The distinction between sex and gender helped to visualize the influence of socio-cultural aspects in shaping identity and people's sexual roles, although this does not mean ignoring the influence of the biological and the natural. But, above all, it has enable us to detect and denounce the infamous, derogatory or dehumanizing manner in which many people have been (and still are) treated and perceived because of their sexual identity and role assigned (like women or homosexuals). Nor is it true that highlighting the socio-cultural elements associated with sex goes against the family and motherhood, but rather allows us to recognize other forms of family, apart from the familiar model assumed by the religion of those who criticize the  notion  of  gender,  a  model  they  considered  to  be  the  only  possible  one  because  it  is natural. And, ultimately, treating equally those other forms of family models is something that emanates from the very beginning of formal legal or formal equality enshrined in Article 14 SC, which had already forced, in turn, the elimination of the distinction that  law had recognized between children born in wedlock and those born out of wedlock.  Moreover, when the appellants allege a lack of consensus on the distinction between sex and gender, they do not take into account that the international and EU legal instruments that introduce  a  gender  perspective  are  based  on  a  fairly  widespread  international  consensus, evidenced, for example, by the number of countries that have signed these texts, drafted at the behest of the UN. Nor can we forget that national legal texts as LOIMH, the Education Act or the Domestic Violence Act were adopted in Parliament, that is, they were the result of a democratic procedure whose operation is based on parliamentary debate and the principle of the majority. Alleging, as they have done, that this is due to the pressure of certain lobbies requires, of course, better evidence. Nor do they take into account that article 9.2 of the SC requires  the  State  to  promote  the  conditions  for  freedom  and  equality  of  individuals  and groups to which they belong to make equality real and effective, removing obstacles that prevent or hinder the full enjoyment and participation of all citizens in political, economic, cultural and social life.   10 Through the appeals argued before it, the SC has established case law on this issue. These sentences, even with dissenting votes, had the full backing of the majority. All of them are dated from 11 February 2009. In all of these decisions, the SC considers that there is no indoctrination  in  gender ideology, and it is  not  harmful,  according to  the  LOIMH or the Council of Europe. The SC says also that the appellants do not explain what they mean by gender  ideology  or  prove  its  negative  effects.  It  also  indicates  that  state  regulations  and regional governments are moving within the scope of the recommendations set by the EU. And finally, SC says that there is no right to conscientious objection to these subjects that can be  deduced  from  Articles  16  and  27.3  of  the  SC  or  from  other  provisions  of  our  law. However,  some  dissenting  opinions  justify  the  recognition  of  this  right  by  judicial interpretation in the style of common law, although there are no specific rules permitting it -interpositio  legislatoris.  Moreover,  the  judges  deny  that  State  is  guilty  of  indoctrination, because  its  activity  is  within  the  limits  of  paragraphs  2  and  5  of  Article  27  of  the  SC, according  to  which  State  should  guarantee  the  respect  of  democratic  principles  and fundamental rights and freedoms.   III. Conclusions  Although, as is commonly accepted, legal rules can only establish minimum requirements for human behavior, while the maximum are the competence of morality (which may or may not be connected to a religion), that does not mean that legal rules cannot establish moral values. In the case of democratic systems, values are essential for its very existence, such as freedom, equality, justice and pluralism (which is recognized in SC). To understand this, we must keep in mind that positivism and iusnaturalism have been left behind in Europe since the end of World War II, instead to adopt constitutionalism. It means legal systems may incorporate moral values, which are typical of modern democracies. Precisely because they establish a minimum, necessary to guarantee democratic coexistence, such minima must not be crossed. And  today  the  eradication  of  gender  discrimination  is  already  part  of  the  minimum.  The prohibition of such discrimination should be framed by article 14 and the often forgotten 9.2 of SC, the CEDAW, the EU Directives and the case law of the CC on this issue as well as the ECHR and the ECJ.  The ultimate question to which the discussion points is whether morality is independent of all political bargaining, agreement or rapprochement of positions. Some moralities present themselves as entrenched positions, intending to be the very last word of every human action. However, it is questionable whether they should prevail at the expense of democratic values, 11 which  rely  on  the  principle  of  dialogue  and  mutual  understanding.  Certainly,  we  must conclude  that  democracy  may  be  incompatible  with  some  moralities,  especially  those emanating from certain religions. But this is not new, as the spokespersons for these religions have shown, stressing that inconsistency and even working so that democracy shall not be the political regime that frames the relationships of their believers.  If we seek to reverse legal rules and social customs that have supported discrimination against women, we should ask if these moral convictions also justifying and encouraging the subordination of women to men can stand apart from these changes.

    "abstract": "This paper seeks to analyse the debate on equality between women and men found in the claims against the subjects related to Education for Citizenship. These claims were resolved in the Spanish Supreme Court and High Courts of the Autonomous Communities. In this debate, there is a strong rejection of antidiscrimination law assumptions, namely that the different roles and social roles of women and men have a cultural and social base and it is unnatural, as evidenced by the concept of gender. But many appellants and judgments defend the difference between women and men as if it was informed and legitimated on human nature. Hence gender is considered an ideology, that is, a category of analysis by means of which the reality of true human nature can be concealed or distorted. But these arguments are opposed to recent legal reforms since they are questioning its normative value, by prioritizing certain moral principles against these laws.
