The study purpose was to explore NewJersey’s child welfare agency in the context of policy changesduring litigated reform that diminished the influence of institu-tional heteronormativity contributing to inadequate care of les-bian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ) fosteryouth. LGBTQ-related policy-based reforms identified throughdocument analysis included: (a) leveraging the authority ofstate sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression(SOGIE) based anti-discrimination legislation; (b) establishinga Safe Space Initiative program; and (c) integrating SOGIE-basedanti-discrimination policy and procedural changes to LGBTQyouth case practice, management, service provision, and place-ment decisions.ARTICLE HISTORYReceived 23 July 2018Revised 18 March 2019Accepted 28 March 2019KEYWORDSLGBTQ; foster care; litigatedreform; child welfare;heteronormativityIn the U.S., social institutions are grounded in an embedded ideologicalsystem that perpetuates a binary conception of sexuality as normative withentrenched heterosexual values, structure, and social rules that disenfranchiseand marginalize those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, orquestioning their sexuality (LGBTQ1) (McCormick, Schmidt, & Terrazas,2017; Warner, 1991; Wilson & Kastanis, 2015). Warner (1991) coined theterm “heteronormativity” to describe the socio-cultural bias for an invariantmale/female conception of sexuality that perpetuates homophobic stereo-types and prejudice against same-sex attraction or those who fail to demon-strate rigid gender norms and behaviors that are ascribed based on birthgender. Within state child welfare and foster care systems, institutionalheteronormativity has been embedded in agency policy, procedures, andprotocols dictating case practice standards, training, case management, andservice provision that have ignored the needs of the LGBTQ youth popula-tion and undermined the ability of the agency to fulfill its mandate to provideequal and competent care to all youth in foster care (Annie E. CaseyFoundation [AECF], 2016; Mallon, 1997; McCormick et al., 2017; Wilson& Kastanis, 2015).CONTACT Ariel Alvarez alvareza@mail.montclair.eduJOURNAL OF PUBLIC CHILD WELFARE2020, VOL. 14, NO. 2, 231–253https://doi.org/10.1080/15548732.2019.1602098© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCAmong more than 400,000 children and adolescents in the U.S. foster caresystem, youth who identify as LGBTQ are significantly over-represented(Children’s Rights, n.d., ¶, p. 1). For example, in the Los Angeles foster caresystem, 19.2% of youth in care identify as LGBTQ compared to 9.45% in thegeneral population (Williams Institute, 2015, p. 9). Primary causes for LGBTQyouth entrance into foster care are sexual orientation, gender identity, and genderexpression (SOGIE) based family disapproval, conflict, rejection, and/or victimi-zation (AECF, 2016; Maccio & Ferguson, 2016; McCormick et al., 2017).Unfortunately, LGBTQ youth often enter a foster care system environment thatis hostile, exclusionary, and ill-equipped to meet their safety, well-being, andpermanency needs (Martin, Down, & Erney, 2016).Federal and state laws govern child welfare agency (CWA) case managementand professional practice care standards for youth in the foster care system (ChildWelfare Information Gateway [CWIG], 2016). Historically, state SOGIE-basedlegislation and state child welfare agency (CWA) policies and practices had createdbarriers to appropriate casemanagement, access to LGBTQ-specific programs andservices, and affirming and accepting placements for LGBTQ youth in foster care(Maccio & Ferguson, 2016; Tobias, 2014). At the federal level, agencies that receivefederal funding are prohibited from SOGIE-based discrimination (Annie E. CaseyFoundation, 2016; McCormick et al., 2017). However, McCormick et al. (2017)noted that as of 2017, no federal policies existed explicitly aimed at protecting therights of LGBTQ youth in foster care.Currently, LGBTQ-related laws that support the rights and equitable treat-ment of LGBTQ youth in foster care vary widely across state jurisdictions (AnnieE. Casey Foundation, 2016; CWIG, 2016; Get, 2017). Lack of LGBTQ-specificfederal and state legislation have left many CWA leaders confronted with vagueor absent laws to guide policy-making decisions (Child Welfare InformationGateway, 2016; McCormick et al., 2017). As of 2015, only 13 States and theDistrict of Columbia had explicit non-discrimination laws or policies in placethat supported protections against SOGIE-based discrimination of LGBTQyouth in foster care (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, NewJersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, andWashington) (Human Rights Campaign [HRC], 2015; States News Service,2015). Recent anti-discrimination legislative changes, especially at the statelevel, has provided CWA leaders with greater power and authority to createand implement systemic policies, strategies, and practices specific to LGBTQyouth case practice and management, contracted agency service provision,recruiting and training of foster parents, and finalizing adoptions by same-sexparents (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2016).The present study was conducted from the position that heteronormativepolicy structures dominate the U.S. state child welfare system and havehistorically led to agency rules, policies, and practices that promoted unequaland inadequate care for LGBTQ foster youth. One approach to diminishing232 A. ALVAREZthe influence of the heteronormative bias endemic within CWAs is througha litigated-based reform strategy that leverages the power and authority of thecourt to facilitate the implementation of institutional reforms in policy andpractice standards to create a more equitable and competent system of carefor LGBTQ foster youth. It can be informative for child welfare professionalsto look at litigated reform cases for lessons learned about how litigation-influenced policy changes can diminish the institutional heteronormativebias in case management, placement, and service provision for LGBTQyouth in foster care (Noonan, Sabel, & Simon, 2009; Ryan & Gomez,2017). The focus of the study was guided by the research question: Whatevidence was identified that demonstrated New Jersey’s child welfare agencyimplemented policies and procedures during a litigated reform process thathad the capacity to reduce institutional heteronormative bias and improvethe care of LGBTQ youth in the state foster care system?Brief case overview: Charlie & Nadine H. v. McGreevey (1999) classaction lawsuitIn New Jersey, a history of underfunding, frequent leadership changes,understaffing, and inadequate training within the state child welfare system,identified in this study as the Department of Children and Families (DCF2),contributed to significant systemic deficiencies that placed at serious risk thesafety, well-being, and permanency of youth in foster care (McGreevey,Davy, & Heins, 2004). In 1999, Children’s Rights child advocacy groupfiled the Charlie & Nadine H. v. McGreevey class action lawsuit as a legalremedy to address a pattern of neglect, abuse, and fatalities of youth in theNew Jersey foster care system (McGreevey et al., 2004). Specific to theLGBTQ youth population, prior to the lawsuit, no mention was made intwo state-wide assessments, program improvement plans, or the two federallymandated Child and Family Service Reviews on how DCF evaluated anddirected LGBTQ case practice and management to ensure equal and compe-tent care for LGBTQ foster youth.To settle the Charlie & Nadine H. v. McGreevey (1999) lawsuit, DCF agreed toplacement under court-appointed monitor oversight until the agency demon-strated compliance with all litigated settlement agreement (SA) requirements(McGreevey et al., 2004). In 2003, as part of the SA, DCF implementeda systemic reform plan that included policy changes intended to improve agencyservice provision, case practice, placement, andmanagement for LGBQ youth infoster care (McGreevey et al., 2004). Significant reforms included: (a) mandatoryLGBTQ-specific training for the agency workforce and contracted service pro-viders; (b) revised recruitment, licensing, and training policies for foster andadoptive parents with a focus on recruiting from within the LGBT community;(c) increased availability of programs and services for meeting the specific careLGBTQ YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE 233needs of LGBTQ foster youth; and (d) revised policies to reflect the integrationof anti-discrimination legislation in case practice and management of LGBTQyouth in foster care (Center for the Study of Social Policy [CSSP], 2007a;McGreevey et al., 2004). The DCF reform process and compliance with perfor-mance outcomes were documented in 19 monitoring and additional supple-mental reports made public by the monitor between 2004 and 2017.Use of litigation as a strategy for CWA foster care reformSince the 1980s, over 70 class action lawsuits across 32 states have been filedby child welfare advocates to leverage court authority to force state CWAleaders to implement systemic institutional reforms to improve agency func-tioning, program and service provision, and case practice standards for youthin foster care (Kosanovich, Joseph, & Hasbargen, 2005; Noonan et al., 2009;Ryan & Gomez, 2017; Wald, 2017). “A class action lawsuit is a civil courtprocedure under which one party, or a group of parties, sue as representativeof a larger class of individuals” (Kosanovich et al., 2005, p. 2). Child welfareadvocates who have used a litigation reform strategy argue that through classaction lawsuits, the state legislature and CWA leaders are forced to conducta systemic assessment of CWA functioning and provide the workforce,funding, and resources necessary to produce improvements in agency struc-ture, operations, and provision of care (Kosanovich et al., 2005; Ryan &Gomez, 2017). Additionally, child welfare advocates view litigated reform asan approach to compelling CWA leaders and state legislatures to evaluateand address laws and agency policies perpetuating a heteronormative biasthat contributes to the discriminatory, inequitable, and inadequate treatmentof LGBTQ youth involved with the state child welfare system (Kosanovichet al., 2005; Moe & Church, 2015; Ryan & Gomez, 2017).Litigated reform cases often involve SA stipulations required for resolutionand exit from the lawsuit. SAs generally involve: (a) a court appointed panel ofexperts who serve as technical advisors and oversight monitors; (b) developmentof a reform plan that includes performance and service benchmarks with legallyenforceable deadlines for compliance; (c) stipulations for reporting and account-ability requirements; and (d) increased funding from the state legislature tosupport the reform process (Children’s Rights, n.d.; Jagannathan & Camasso,2013; Kosanovich et al., 2005; McCormick et al., 2017; Moe & Church, 2015;Noonan et al., 2009; Ryan & Gomez, 2017; Wald, 2017). At least twenty of 70lawsuits filed against state health and human services and child welfare systemshave resulted in SAs that remained in effect for more than a decade with one ormore modifications (Jagannathan & Camasso, 2013; Kosanovich et al., 2005). In2015, New Jersey’s DCF entered into a new Sustainability and Exit Plan (SEP) totransition out of the lawsuit. At the time of the present study, DCF had not yetmet the requirements of the SEP to exit federal oversight.234 A. ALVAREZLitigation strategy to improve CWA functioning and care provisionA class action litigation strategy for improving failed child welfare systemshas produced mixed results on a continuum from no real improvements tosubstantive and sustained improvements in agency functioning and clientoutcomes (Jagannathan & Camasso, 2013; Noonan et al., 2009; Ryan &Gomez, 2017; Wald, 2017). In Mississippi, a litigated reform strategy failedto produced substantive or sustained improvement to the state child welfareagency that continued to demonstrate serious deficiencies, poor performanceand a failure to meet over half of 19 SA standards (Gates, 2014, ¶ 3; Amy,2015; 2016, ¶, p. 4). However, significant litigated-based state CWA reformsand measurable system improvements and performance outcomes wererealized in Alabama, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico,Tennessee, Utah, and Washington (CSSP, 2012; Jagannathan & Camasso,2013; Mattise, 2017). For example, in Tennessee, litigation linked to court-ordered mandated reforms resulted in sustained systemic improvements(Jagannathan & Camasso, 2013; Mattise, 2017). In Alabama, Missouri, andUtah, rates of physical and sexual child abuse and neglect were reducedsignificantly (Jagannathan & Camasso, 2013). Several states under litigated-based reform have had their cases closed following successful compliancewith SA performance requirements (e.g., AR, FL, HI, ID, KS, MI, MN, NH,NM, NY, NC, and WA) (Jagannathan & Camasso, 2013; Kosanovich et al.,2005). These outcomes have provided support that litigated-based reformscan promote improvements in CWA institutional functioning and provisionof care for youth in foster care.The use of a litigated strategy for reform to improve the system of care hasbecome a prominent approach by child welfare advocates during the past30 years. The purpose of the study was to explore LGBTQ-specific DCFagency policy changes in the context of litigated reform that had the capacityto diminish the influence of institutional heteronormatively biased policiesthat contributed to unequal and incompetent care of LGBTQ youth in thestate foster care system. The study was bounded by document analysismethods used to identify changes in DCF policies guiding case practice andmanagement of the LGBTQ youth population in foster care during theperiod of the New Jersey class action lawsuit case of Charlie and NadineH. v. McGreevey (1999).MethodsA qualitative research design using case study and document analysis meth-ods was used to explore the implementation of LGBTQ-specific policiesguiding the care of LGBTQ youth in DCF care during an extended litigatedsystemic reform process to improve the functioning of the New Jersey stateLGBTQ YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE 235CWA system. The New Jersey CWA was selected for the case study based onthree key factors: (a) system-wide reform took place during an extended timeperiod between 2003 and 2017 that provided sufficient time to observechanges in policy and practice; (b) systemic performance requirementswere stipulated in a court approved SA; and (c) frequent comprehensiveagency performance assessments were conducted and made publicly acces-sible through monitoring reports detailing CWA reform progress and SAcompliance.Data collection and analysisPublicly accessible data sources were used to explore the litigated policy andprocedural change factors affecting the reform process in case practice,service provision, and case management of LGBTQ youth in the NewJersey CWA foster care system. Due to time and access limitations, datasources were restricted to the New Jersey CWA policy Manual, Charlie andNadine H. v. McGreevey (1999) settlement agreements (2003 original, 2006modified, and 2015 sustainability and exit plan), state policies concerningLGBTQ youth, comprehensive CWA reform plan A New Beginning; TheFuture of Child Welfare (McGreevey et al., 2004), and 19 monitoring reportspublished between December 2004 and July 2017 detailing oversight andagency performance assessments in meeting the requirements of the Charlieand Nadine H. v. McGreevey litigated SAs. The document analysis processwas bounded around the topic of SOGIE anti-discrimination legislation,LGBTQ-specific CWA policies, creating an SOGIE inclusive agency environ-ment, and case practice and management of LGBTQ youth in foster care. Thedata sources were given equal weight during the analysis process.Document analysis is a qualitative research method used to assess andinterpret documents in a process of identifying and coding content ona specific topic (O’Leary, 2014). Document analysis involves multiple read-ings by the researcher in an iterative and reflective process to identify themesor meanings on the topic of study (O’Leary, 2014). Data obtained throughthe document analysis method was used to identify changes in legislation,policies, procedures, case management, and care of LGBTQ youth in the NewJersey state foster care system. Data analysis began by employing QRS NVivo11 (2015) qualitative data analysis software to conduct a word search toidentify text that discussed issues relevant to the study purpose and researchquestion. Search words included: gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, ques-tioning, LGBT, sexual orientation, sexual minority, litigation, lawsuit, genderidentity, gender expression, sexual orientation and expression, policy, legisla-tion, and multiple combinations of these key words into word groups. Usinginformation from the NVivo 11 search, document transcript excerpts wereidentified, organized, and grouped by the search word terms. These236 A. ALVAREZtranscripts were read and re-read from the original document in an iterativeprocess that resulted in the identification of text that contained informationrelevant to the study purpose and research question.Establishing trustworthinessIn qualitative research, the soundness of the research findings is dependenton the trustworthiness of the inquiry methods used (Creswell, 2012). Theresearcher attempted to strengthen the trustworthiness of the study findingsthrough the use of multiple document sources, application of triangulation,keeping a reflective journal to create awareness of personal bias, and main-taining an audit trail that included notations of possible data problems andissues of author subjectivity and bias present in the document (Creswell,2012; O’Leary, 2014). Triangulation techniques employed included collectingdata from multiple-text-based sources and taking observation notes duringthe analysis process that included the researcher’s conceptions and ideaswhile reading through texts (Creswell, 2012).FindingsThe findings of the analysis of documents produced as part of the class actionlitigation of New Jersey’s CWA are presented in the context of evidence ofpolicies and procedures implemented that had the capacity to remove orlessen the institutional heteronormative bias in the case management andcare of LGBTQ youth in the New Jersey state foster care system. The findingsof the document analysis are presented relative to the study research ques-tion: What evidence was identified that demonstrated New Jersey’s childwelfare agency implemented policies and procedures during a litigatedreform process that had the capacity to reduce institutional heteronormativebias and improve the care of LGBTQ youth in the state foster care system?During the litigated reform process, DCF implemented LGBTQ-specificpolicy and procedural changes to improve professional practice competenciesamong the DCF workforce, contracted service providers, foster parents, andothers involved with case management, service provision, and care ofLGBTQ youth in foster care. Three areas of change identified that occurredduring the litigated reform process included: (a) leveraging the authority ofstate SOGIE-based anti-discrimination legislation; (b) establishing a SafeSpace Initiative program network of information, support, and advocacyfor the care needs of the LGBTQ foster youth population; and (c) integratingSOGIE-based anti-discrimination policy and procedural changes to LGBTQyouth case practice and management, provision of services, and placementdecisions (CSSP, 2015a; McGreevey et al., 2004).LGBTQ YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE 237Charlie and Nadine H. v. McGreevey (1999) settlement agreementsA review of the three settlement agreements revealed that no LGBTQ content wasexplicitly presented in the 2003 original SA. In the 2006 modified SA, a singlereference was made in terms of the LGBTQ youth population: “The State shallmake every effort to ensure that all children shall receive equal and appropriateaccess to services without regard to race, religion, sexual identity or ethnic origin”(p. 3).Within the 2015 SEP was a single requirement that the state would “providecomprehensive, culturally responsive services to address the identified needs of thechildren, youth and families it serves … . These services shall include but not belimited to… LGBTQI services” (Center for the Study of Social Policy, 2016, p. 47).The monitor reported that DCF fulfilled SA requirements to improve services forLGBTQ youth (Center for the Study of Social Policy, 2016). No other LGBTQ-specific content was identified among the three SAs.Leveraging the authority of state SOGIE-based anti-discriminationlegislationBacked by federal and state legislation, DCF leaders engaged in a collaborativeprocess of creating and implementing formal SOGIE anti-discrimination sup-ported policies, procedures, and case practice standards with the capacity forreducing institutional heteronormative biased barriers to equitable and competentcase management of LGBTQ youth in foster care (New Jersey Department ofChildren and Families [NJ DCF] Child Protection and Permanency Manual,2016a). New Jersey’s general non-discrimination law recognizes an individual’sSOGIE status as a civil right and provides protection against SOGIE-baseddiscrimination as outlined in the state’s general social services law that dealsspecifically with the treatment of clients served by the CWA (Get, 2017). Thelaw stipulates that DCF prohibits “discriminating against an applicant or client onthe basis of race; color; ethnicity; national origin; age; handicapping condition;gender; religion; marital; civil union; domestic partnership; parental or birthstatus; affectional or sexual orientation” (see N.J. Admin. Code 10:133–1.4,“Rights of applicants and clients” as cited in Get R.E.A.L., 2017, p. 5). This SOGIE-based anti-discrimination legislation gave DCF leaders greater authority than inthe past to create new or revise existing LGBTQ non-discrimination policies (NJDCF, 2016a). For example, New Jersey has a regulatory and policy-based protec-tions against SOGIE-based discrimination in case management and service provi-sion for youth in foster care (see N.J. Admin. Code 10:122B-1.5, “Servicelimitations,” N.J. Admin. Code 10:133–1.4, “Rights of applicants and clients”).Human rights campaign, all children-all families initiative projectIn 2007, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Family Project All Children-All Families (ACAF) program was launched nationwide. One focus of theACAF program was to engage in a collaborative partnership with CWAs to238 A. ALVAREZimprove case management, service provision, and placement of LGBTQyouth in foster care (NJ DCF, n.d.). HRC (2015) published guidelines andten performance benchmarks to promote competent and equitable foster carefor LGBTQ youth. State CWAs who participate in the campaign and achievethe ten ACAF performance benchmarks receive the HRC’s Seal ofRecognition as a leader in supporting and serving LGBTQ youth and theirfamilies (NJ DCF, n.d.; Tobias, 2014, ¶, p. 4). DCF began participation in theACAF program in 2008 and was the first state to receive the Seal ofRecognition (Tobias, 2014, ¶, p. 5).To support DCF participation in the HRC ACAF program, the New Jerseylegislature added an addendum to the state’s SOGIE-based anti-discrimination policy indicating the state would not deny any foster parentlicensure based on SOGIE status (CSSP, 2010a). Backed by this anti-discrimination legislation, DCF implemented new policy mandatingLGBTQ youth foster placements be free from SOGIE based discriminatorytreatment. Placements were prohibited where “The child is subjected todiscriminatory treatment within the resource home based on race; religion;sex; gender identity; sexual orientation; background; physical, mental, oremotional handicaps; or other factors” (NJ DCF, 2016b, p. 2). Additionally,effective in 2008 and updated in 2014, the agency Child Protection andPermanency (CP&P) manual included policy protecting the right of anyqualified individual becoming a foster or adoptive parent regardless ofSOGIE status:A decision to place or not to place a child in a specific resource family home shallnot be based solely upon the resource parent’s or the child‘s age; gender; disability;religion or religious beliefs; race or color; culture, national origin or ethnicity;sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression; affectional orientation.(NJ DCF, 2013b, p. 6)Leveraging the authority provided in New Jersey SOGIE-based anti-discrimination legislation, in 2013, DCF outlined CP&P policy to support activerecruitment of foster parents regardless of SOGIE status: “Efforts may alsoinvolve recruiting homes for specific target populations including, but notlimited to: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning youth, inter-sexedyouth (LGBTQI)” (NJ DCF, 2013a, p. 7). DCF collaborated with individuals andgroups within the LGBTQ community to facilitate the active recruitment ofLGBTQ foster and adoptive parents with specific training relevant to the care ofLGBTQ youth in foster care (CSSP, 2010a, 2015a; McGreevey et al., 2004; NJDCF, 2016a). Additionally, with respect to child adoptions, in 2014, DCFimplemented policy protection against SOGIE-based discrimination respectiveto child adoption by those who identify as LGBT:The Division shall not discriminate in a child‘s adoptive placement based on thechild‘s or the adoptive parent‘s race, color, national origin, age, gender, disability,LGBTQ YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE 239marital status, sexual orientation, state of residence, or religion… . The Divisionshall allow any adult to apply to be an adoptive parent regardless of age, race,color, national origin, disability, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or maritalstatus. (NJ DCF, 2014, p. 1)Finally, to support inclusive and competent care for LGBTQ youth, duringa three-year licensing cycle, primary care-taker foster parents must completea 21-hour in-service training program with a module on caring for LGBTQyouth and secondary caretakers must complete a 15-hour training program(CSSP, 2015b). Overall, active recruitment of foster and adoptive parents whoidentified as LGBTQ has expanded the pool of qualified foster parents andincreased opportunities for DCF to place LGBTQ youth in accepting andaffirming environments where caregivers possess greater knowledge, skill,and understanding about issues faced by LGBTQ youth (CSSP, 2011b, 2012;CWIG, 2016).Establishing a “safe space” program across the state child welfare systemHistorically, LGBTQ youth in the DCF foster care system had experiencedhigher levels of victimization and more frequent placement disruptions thantheir heterosexual peers (CSSP, 2011a). DCF had a demonstrated pattern offailures by caseworkers to provide protection from victimization, to secure safefoster placements, and to arrange appropriate support and services for LGBTQyouth (CSSP, 2011a). As part of the litigated reform process to improve thesystem of care for LGBT youth, DCF implemented a Safe Space program thatincluded establishing safe zones at all local and regional offices with one or moretrained Safe Space liaisons (CSSP, 2009a, 2009b, 2013, 2014, 2015a).Safe Space liaisons serve as agency information and resource consultants topromote awareness, facilitate access to LGBT-specific community-basedresources and services, maintain an up-to-date LGBTQ resource guide foragency workers, maintain the Safe Space Liaison Resource Management websiteas a centralized portal for finding LGBTQ-specific information and resources,and provide case practice guidance to support policy and procedure develop-ment, case management, and decision-making for LGBTQ youth in foster care(CSSP, 2010a, 2010b; Get R.E.A.L., 2017; NJ DCF, 2016a). Safe Space liaisonsalso work with other DCF personnel in a multi-year process to gather LGBTQdata to assess existing provider service contracts and, where indicated, re-orientresources to address current needs (CSSP, 2011b, 2013, 2016, 2017b). In 2012, anLGBQI coordinator began working closely with all Safe Space liaisons through-out the agency to enhance their connections with community partners at thelocal and national level and to develop in-service training for all Safe Spaceliaisons to improve their knowledge and skill base in working with LGBTQyouth, agency personnel, families, and community partners (Center for theStudy of Social Policy, 2012).240 A. ALVAREZImplementing LGBTQ inclusive policies across the state child welfaresystemA document analysis of the current DCF CP&P manual noted several recentchanges with respect to the inclusion of SOGIE anti-discrimination supportedpolicies and procedures around service provision and care of the LGBTQfoster youth population. In 2015, DCF finalized new LGBTQ-related policieswith input from the LGBTQI Youth Advisory Committee, an advisory/advo-cacy board for the care/treatment of LGBTQI youth in the child welfare systemthat was formed in 2008 (CSSP, 2009a; 2016; NJ DCF, n.d.). The LGBTQIYouth Advisory Committee worked with DCF for over two years to developand advocate for LGBTQ policies that were finalized and implement onSeptember 8, 2015 (CSSP, 2015b, 2016). Policy and procedural changes madeby DCF included: (a) implementation of institution-wide SOGIE-based anti-discrimination policies; (b) revision of agency assessment forms, personnel andresource family training curricula, and documentation with LGBTQ inclusivelanguage; (c) creation of an agency website as a source of information,recruitment activities, resources, and access to programs and services toimprove the case management and care of LGBTQ youth in foster care; (d)active recruitment of LGBTQ foster and adoptive parents; and (e) utilizing anLGBTQ-inclusive case practice model (NJ LGBTQ, n.d., ¶ 16). These policychanges increased the capacity of DCF to diminish the influence of institu-tional heteronormative biases that contributed unequal and inadequate care ofLGBTQ youth in foster care.LGBTQ-specific trainingAcross many state CWAs, poorly trained case workers coupled with ambiguousor absent SOGIE-based case practice standards and institutional policies hascontributed to inadequate case management and service provision for LGBTQyouth in foster care (McCormick, Schmidt, & Terrazas, 2016). As part of thelitigated reform plan, in 2009, DCF collaborated with New Jersey’s RutgersInstitute for Families and Rutgers Child advocacy Center to develop and imple-ment a 6-hour training module for agency personnel and contracted serviceproviders that focused on LGBTQ issues and competent care practice standards(CSSP, 2009b). The focus of the DCF LGBTQ-related training module was todispel SOGIE-based misconceptions, increase knowledge and skill working withthe LGBTQ population, promote understanding and application of confidenti-ality protocols, and develop competence in conducting family assessments,home studies, and dealing with LGBTQ related case management issues(CSSP, 2012).In 2013, DCF launched the New Jersey Child Welfare Training Academy tohost and update as needed a skills-based curriculum with classroom and inte-grated on-the-job training components (CSSP, 2014, 2015b, 2017a). BeginningLGBTQ YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE 241in 2016, all DCF leadership staff and front-line workers were required tocomplete a two-day mandatory LGBTQI training module (CSSP, 2017a).Finally, as part of an ongoing review and revision process of its LGBTQ-specific competency training, DCF continued to work collaboratively withLGBTQ clients, foster families, contracted service providers, community groups,advocacy centers, the media, and others involved with the LGBTQ population(CSSP, 2015b).Providing equal access to careDCF CP&P policy dictates that a system of inclusive and competent care andservice provision be established throughout the child welfare agency system for theLGBTQ foster youth population. As part of the litigated SA, by 2007, DCF wasrequired to implement LGBTQ inclusive service delivery: “Develop and thereafterimplement a plan for appropriate service delivery for gay, lesbian, bisexual,transgender and questioning (GLBTQ) youth” (CSSP, 2007a). As part of DCF’sparticipation in the HRC ACAF program, the agency conducted an assessment offederal and state laws and DCF policies, and practices that might havea discriminatory effect and create barriers to service provision for youth whoidentify as LGBTQ and their families (CSSP, 2009a). Effective in 2008 and revisedin 2010, DCFCP&P policy was issued providing LGBTQ youth and families equalaccess to resources and services: “The CP&P practice of inclusion extends toservice delivery. Therefore, heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, ques-tioning and intersexed youth are provided with equal access to all availableservices, including placement, care, and treatment” (NJ DCF, 2011, p. 1).DCF continued resource development work to expand LGBTQ-relatedservices (CSSP, 2017a) with the Safe Space Initiative program as the primaryvehicle for LGBTQ service delivery and provision of care (CSSP, 2013; NJDCF 2016a). The agency utilized a network of contracted program andservice providers that were required to demonstrate competence in workingwith LGBTQ youth, families of origin, LGBTQ foster and adoptive parents,and the LGBTQ community (NJ DCF, 2016a). Case managers worked withSafe Space liaisons to navigate the network of contracted service providers toimprove the ability to meet LGBTQ foster youth needs identified in caseplans (NJ DCF, 2016a). With these changes, DCF was able to fulfill theLGBTQ-specific SA requirements and improve case management and out-comes for LGBTQ youth in DCF foster care (CSSP, 2017b).In summary, through litigated based systemic reforms, measurable agencyimprovements and performance outcomes were realized in New Jersey(Center for the Study of Social Policy, 2012; Jagannathan & Camasso,2013). Using authority derived from federal and state SOGIE anti-discrimination legislation, DCF revised its CP&P manual to instituteLGBTQ-specific protocols for case practice and management that acknowl-edged the importance of including a youth’s SOGIE status in making242 A. ALVAREZprogram, services provision, and placement decisions (CSSP, 2009a; NJ DCF,2016a). The actions taken by DCF included: (a) instituting policy prohibitingSOGIE based discrimination; (b) using LGBTQ inclusive language and con-tent in foster family documentation, homes study training curriculum, andassessment materials; (c) promoting an LGBTQ inclusive agency through theDCF website, printed materials, and use of LGBTQ competent service pro-viders; (d) recruitment of LGBTQ adults as foster or adoptive parents; (e) useof LGBT inclusive language and content in foster parent pre-service and in-service training materials; and (f) implementing an agency wide mandatorytraining with a specific module on LGBTQ case management and care (NJDCF, n.d.; CSSP, 2007a, 2009b, 2010a, 2011a, 2012; McGreevey et al., 2004;NJ DCF, 2016a). Overall, the findings of the document analysis producedevidence that the systemic improvements of the New Jersey CWA would nothave been achieved without litigation and the power of the court to compelthe state legislature and DCF to implement policy-based reforms that had thecapacity to diminish institutional heteronormative bias in agency policies andprocedures and improve the ability to provide LGBTQ foster youth with aninclusive environment and system of equal and appropriate care.DiscussionThis exploratory case study was conducted from the position that state childwelfare systems are dominated by a heteronormative bias in agency struc-tures, policies, and practices that perpetuate and sustain a systemic failure toacknowledge and address the safety, well-being, and permanency needs ofLGBTQ youth in foster care (Mallon, 1997; McCormick et al., 2017). Inrecent years, CWA strategies, policies, and procedures have been implemen-ted aimed at improving the case management, care, and outcomes forLGBTQ foster youth (McCormick et al., 2016).Like the majority of CWA leaders across the U.S., New Jersey’s DCF leaderswere silent on the role of heteronormative bias in the care of LGBTQ youth andhad failed to take institutional responsibility to acknowledge and change hetero-normative structures that perpetuated a discriminatory, exclusionary, andunsafe environment for LGBTQ youth in foster care (McGreevey et al., 2004).Through class action litigation, New Jersey’s CWA was compelled to acknowl-edged a history of inadequate care of LGBTQ foster youth and to engage ina systemic review and reform of its entire child welfare system. As part of thelitigated SA institutional reform process, DCF worked to create a legally-backedsystemic framework to support inclusive and equitable care, placement, andservice provision for LGBTQ foster youth (McGreevey et al., 2004).DCF leaders implemented a litigated systemic reform plan under monitoroversight that promoted diminished institutional heteronormative biasthrough formal SOGIE anti-discrimination based policies and practices,LGBTQ YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE 243training, adherence to an LGBTQ responsive case practice model, a network offoster parents and contracted service providers with specific training andguidelines in case practice standards for the care of LGBTQ youth, andinstalling Safe Space liaisons to serve as consultants and advocates forLGBTQ youth, agency staff, and service providers (McGreevey et al., 2004).Through the litigated reform process, that capacity for institutional hetero-normative bias to influence the care of LGBTQ foster youth was reducedthrough: (a) SOGIE-based anti-discrimination legislation; (b) CWA leadership;(c) forming collaborative partnerships; (d) revising the agency case practicemodel; (e) and providing inclusive and affirming foster placements.Founding LQBTQ-specific policies on SOGIE-based anti-discriminationlegislationLGBTQ foster youth across the U.S. continue to face heteronormative biasand discrimination arising from limited understanding about laws, statutes,and policies among child welfare leaders and lack of training among agencypersonnel, foster parents, and program and service providers (McCormicket al., 2017; States News Service, 2015). When federal and state laws are vagueor absent of legal guidelines, this creates uncertainty and limits the authorityof CWA leaders to create and implement case management policies andprocedures to provide equal and competent care for LGBTQ youth in fostercare (LGBT Foster and Adoptive Families, 2012).New Jersey’s DCF leaders leveraged federal and state SOGIE anti-discrimination legislation as a foundation to revise and create formal agencypolicies and procedures that specifically addressed the needs of LGBTQ youthreceiving preservation services or who were placed in the foster care system(Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2016; HRC, 2015; States News Service, 2015).This finding points to the effectiveness of child welfare leaders tapping into thepower and authority of federal and state general SOGIE anti-discriminationlaws to draft and implement LGBTQ-specific non-discrimination policies toguide the equitable treatment of the LGBTQ youth population in foster care(Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2016; Human Rights Campaign, 2015; Maccio &Ferguson, 2016; McCormick et al., 2016).The role of CWA leadershipDuring the early period of the reform process, New Jersey CWA leadersfrequently encountered an entrenched institutional culture, low morale,agency personnel, and external providers resistant to the change process(CSSP, 2007b, 2010a, 2010b). This was due in part to individual, groups,and external service providers becoming overwhelmed and frustrated by thepace of change implemented. Field-level supervisors and front-line workers244 A. ALVAREZwere overwhelmed with too many new policies and procedures imposed atone time in a system lacking sufficient resources and assistance to supportseveral changes simultaneously (Shookhoff, 2012; Vincent, 2012). AmongCWAs, this can be especially true when policies and procedures are directedat changing the status quo and challenging beliefs, norms, and ways ofbehaving toward those who identify as LGBTQ.Exemplified during the New Jersey CWA litigated reform process was theimportant role of leadership during periods of transformative institutionalchange. State and CWA senior-level leader beliefs and actions linked to thelitigated reform process can alter agency and community relationships andpartnerships, funding and resource acquisition, application of authority andcontrol for reform-based policy and practice decisions, and management ofdaily agency operations (Bertelli, 2004; Vincent, 2012). New Jersey CWA leadersserved as the main sources of authority and control over implementing agencyLGBTQ related policies and procedures to achieve compliance with SA require-ments in service provision and casemanagement of LGBTQ youth in foster care.There was an increased level of commitment demonstrated among DCF leaderswho served as change agents by making significant structural and policy changesthat fostered removal of many barriers LGBTQ youth often face as they navigatethrough the child welfare system and foster care placement. Through thelitigated reform process, heteronormative bias within the CWA system wasdiminished through state legislative, governmental, and CWA leaders whocommunicated and modeled LGBTQ inclusive beliefs, norms, and ways ofbehaving that facilitated movement toward a more accepting and equitableinstitutional culture of care for LGBTQ foster youth.Collaborative partnershipsA reduction in the influence of institutional heteronormativity within CWAscan be promoted through CWA leaders forming collaborative partnerships withfoster youth and parents, legislators, agency personnel, community members,external service providers, and LGBTQ advocacy groups (McGreevey et al.,2004). In New Jersey, DCF leaders engaged in an institutional reform processamid increasing anxiety and uncertainty among agency personnel about howimplemented policies and procedures would affect work responsibilities, thework environment, and expected ways of behaving within the institutionalsetting. A shift to a more cooperative and collaborative environment and team-based approach to implementation of LGBTQ-related policies, procedures, andcase practice standards brought to the reform process a diversity of voices,experiences, and ideas that facilitated an improvement in case management,the array of LGBTQ-specific programs and services provided, involvement fromthe community, and improved outcomes for LGBTQ youth in foster care(McGreevey et al., 2004).LGBTQ YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE 245Community-based program and service providers can “make or break”efforts by child welfare advocates and CWA leaders to implement and sustainLGBTQ-specific reforms to create an inclusive institutional structure andservice provision for LGBTQ foster care youth, resource parents, and com-munity members. Through partnering with members of the LGBTQ com-munity and external entities (e.g., academic institutions, religious-based non-governmental agencies, and LGBT advocacy groups) and involving theLGBTQI Youth Committee in the policy making process, DCF was able toprovide expanded resource access and affirming and accepting placementopportunities for LGBTQ foster youth (CSSP, 2010a).The implementation of the Safe Space Initiative program was a significantcomponent to diminishing the influence of heteronormative bias within theDCF system of care. Safe Space liaisons formed collaborative partnerships withcommunity members and LGBTQ advocacy groups to create awareness andpromote equitable and affirming case management and care of LGBTQ fosteryouth. The Safe Space Liaison Resource Management website and the LGBTQresources guide provided central points of information for identifying referralsto community-based providers for counseling, health, mental health, or otherservices for LGBTQ youth, families, and members of the community (CSSP,2011a, 2014; NJ DCF, 2016a). The installation of neighborhood-based FamilySuccess Centers within the community helped DCF expand access to compre-hensive services to address the unique needs of LGBTQ youth in foster care(Center for the Study of Social Policy, 2016). Overall, active involvement of SafeSpace liaisons served as a portal of information and actively supported LGBTQ-specific DCF policies and procedures to promote the equitable and competentcare of LGBTQ youth (Center for the Study of Social Policy, 2014).LGBTQ-responsive case practice modelEmbodied in the formal CWA case practice model are institutional policies andpractices that represent the underlying assumptions and values foundational todaily operations and achievement of agency goals (Craig-Oldsen, Craig, &Morton, 2006; McCormick et al., 2017). Institutional heteronormativity con-tributes to LGBTQ youth facing barriers to effective care the moment they enterthe state child welfare system (Mallon, 1997; McCormick et al., 2016). LGBTQyouth often experience inadequate care, placement instability, and lack of socialsupport networks contributing to social isolation, emotional and behavioralproblems, and running from foster care (McCormick et al., 2016).As with other state CWAs, a case practice model lacking LGBTQ-specificpolicies and procedures presented DCF case workers with barriers and challengesto accessing programs and services, finding appropriate placements, and achievingpermanency for LGBTQ youth in foster care (Craig-Oldsen et al., 2006; Maccio &Ferguson, 2016; Mallon, 1997; McCormick et al., 2017). An outcome of the246 A. ALVAREZCharlie and Nadine v. McGreevey (1999) SA was increased attention given todeveloping and implementing a case practice model that incorporated best prac-tice standards for addressing the unique safety, well-being, and permanency needsof LGBTQ foster youth. Using authority derived from federal and state SOGIEanti-discrimination legislation and input and feedback from LGBTQ communityand advocacy groups, DCF developed and implemented a new case practicemodel that included LGBTQ-specific standards of care (Center for the Study ofSocial Policy, 2007a; 2009b, 2010a, 2015a; NJ DCF, 2016a). The new case practicemodel protocols and care guidelines helped diminish the application of hetero-normative biased standards of practice and fostered a more responsive system ofcare for LGBTQ youth and their families.Expanded LGBTQ foster youth placement opportunitiesPlacement of LGBTQ youth in affirming and accepting foster homes promotestability and facilitates access to support, resources, and services (Craig-Oldsenet al., 2006; McCormick et al., 2017; McHaelen, 2016). Historically, institutionalheteronormativity within CWAs has limited foster or adoptive parents to thoseliving within a heterosexual family structure (Bardzell & Bernard, 2015. This hasconstrained the ability of CWA case managers to find appropriate placementsfor LGBTQ foster youth (McCormick et al., 2017; McHaelen, 2016).Due to policies barring same-sex foster and adoptive parenting, DCF experi-enced an ongoing shortage of affirming foster homes for LGBTQ youth. Similar tomost other CWAs, DCF had not actively recruited foster or adoptive parents fromwithin the LGBTQ community even though positive outcomes and healthydevelopment occurmore often when LGBTQ youth are placed with foster parentswho also identify as LGBTQ (Bardzell & Bernard, 2015; Tobias, 2014). Thesediscriminatory placement policies contributed to a higher incidence of congregatecare placements, placement disruptions, inability to achieve long-term perma-nency, and LGBTQ youth aging out of foster care compared to their heterosexualpeers (McCormick et al., 2017;McHaelen, 2016; States News Service, 2015;Wilson& Kastanis, 2015). Heteronormative bias in LGBTQ youth foster care placementwas reduced through SOGIE anti-discrimination legislation and the implementa-tion of LGBTQ-specific policies and procedures to provide for the recruitment,training, and licensing of same-sex foster and adoptive parents from within theLGBTQ community and, thereby, expanding the pool of affirming placements forLGBTQ foster youth.ConclusionHeteronormativity is a social construction that perpetuates SOGIE-based dis-criminatory and exclusive norms, culture, prejudices, and ways of behaving(Warner, 1991). LGBTQ-specific changes that were an outcome of the litigatedLGBTQ YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE 247mandated reform of the New Jersey CWA represented movement towardcreating a more equitable and inclusive system of care for the LGBTQ fosteryouth population. Without legislative and community support, it would bedifficult if not impossible for New Jersey’s DCF to maintain any progressmade in lessening the influence of institutional heteronormative bias in pro-grams, services, and case management practices for foster youth. Discriminatoryand exclusionary heteronormative attitudes and actions among legislators, reli-gious institutions, CWA leaders, and community members that maintain theheteronormative bias will continue to inhibit change efforts.The findings of the study support the proposition that litigated-based institu-tional reform can promote policy changes that diminish the heteronormativebias endemic in state child welfare systems that has contributed to a history ofmarginalization, victimization, and inadequate care of LGBTQ youth in fostercare (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2016; McCormick et al., 2017). However, evenin the context of litigated mandated reform, CWA leaders continue to facechallenges implementing policies and practices to remove institutional hetero-normative barriers through transformative change within the state foster caresystem (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2016; McCormick et al., 2017).Without anti-discrimination legislation and formal structures to supportinformed actions by agency leaders, substantive change is at risk and effortsto remove systemic heteronormative bias will remain limited and unsustain-able (Mallon, 1997; McCormick et al., 2017). While positive change is takingplace within the U.S. state child welfare system, often institutional reform isnot achieved until child advocates employ class action litigation to compelCWA leaders to engage in substantial assessments of the agency system andrevise current statutes, policies, and procedures guiding the care of LGBTQyouth in foster care (Bardzell & Bernard, 2015). As long as institutionalheteronormativity dominates the U.S state child welfare system, LGBTQyouth in foster care will continue to face an exclusionary environment thatthreatens their safety and jeopardizes their well-being and opportunities toachieve permanency.Limitations and recommendations for future researchA case study of the New Jersey child welfare system reforms to improve theCWA treatment and care of LGBTQ youth in foster care provides insightinto the role of litigated based reform in reducing the influence of institu-tional heteronormative bias. The use of a single case limits the general-izability of the research findings and may not be representative of litigatedreform effects to improve LGBTQ-specific policies within other state fostercare systems. While the study findings may not be generalizable across stateCWA systems, conceptual insights may be drawn that contribute to the body248 A. ALVAREZof knowledge about litigated based reform by adding multiple perspectivesthat might be transferable to similar contexts (Creswell, 2012).The data for the study consisted entirely of written documents. The inclusion ofother document types might have enriched the overall picture of findings pre-sented (O’Leary, 2014). The reliance on a document analysis method can beproblematic because the documents: (a) were not produced using methods toensure research levels of data integrity; (b) were written on a subject and purposedifferent from the study topic; (c) may contain incomplete, inconsistent, orinaccurate data; (d) may not have provided clear or sufficient levels of informationfor the study purpose and research question; and (e) may not include importanttexts due to costs or confidentiality barriers (O’Leary, 2014). Additionally, all datawas collected from historical documents chronicling and reporting on events thathave happened in the past. In dealing with historical documents, the beliefs andactions of policy-makers, administrators, workers, and clients can be inferred onlyfrom formal written accounts. Comparison of evaluations made of the samevariables by different individuals or groups may reflect different perspectives,biases, and perceptions and pose a limitation to the study outcomes (Creswell,2012). Finally, document analysis is a subjective iterative process that allows forthe introduction of researcher bias into the study findings (O’Leary, 2014).The case study can have limitations in terms of analyzing systemic effects ofpolicies and programs (Jagannathan &Camasso, 2013). In recommendations forfurther research, studies involving other CWAs under litigated mandatedreform would capture more fully the challenges and success in diminishing orremoving institutional heteronormative bias within a CWA system through theimplementation of policies and practices that support an inclusive approach tocase practice andmanagement of LGBTQ youth in foster care. Also, an in-depthexploration of funding issues in the context of litigated reform can providevaluable information and increase understanding about the role of litigation instate legislative funding appropriations before, during, and after exit from classaction litigation. Incorporating LGBTQ perspectives in future studies of thisnature would facilitate increased understanding about effective and ineffectivestrategies for removing or lessening the influence of institutionalized hetero-normativity that oppresses, marginalizes, and victimizes LGBTQ youth withinthe U.S child welfare and foster care system.Legal AuthoritiesCharlie and Nadine H. v.

    "abstract": "Institutional heteronormativity is endemic across the U.S. state foster care system. The study purpose was to explore New Jersey’s child welfare agency in the context of policy changes during litigated reform that diminished the influence of institutional heteronormativity contributing to inadequate care of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ) foster youth. LGBTQ-related policy-based reforms identified through document analysis included: (a) leveraging the authority of state sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression (SOGIE) based anti-discrimination legislation; (b) establishing a Safe Space Initiative program; and (c) integrating SOGIE-based anti-discrimination policy and procedural changes to LGBTQ youth case practice, management, service provision, and placement decisions",
