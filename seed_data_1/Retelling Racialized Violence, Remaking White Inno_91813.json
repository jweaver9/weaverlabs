Commemorated in more than 250 locations worldwide,this day honors individuals who were killed due to anti-transgender hatred or prejudice. However, byfocusing on transphobia as the definitive cause of violence, this ritual potentially obscures the ways inwhich hierarchies of race, class, and sexuality constitute such acts. Taking the Transgender Day of Re-membrance/Remembering Our Dead project as a case study for considering the politics of memorial-ization, as well as tracing the narrative history of the Fred F. C. Martinez murder case in Colorado, theauthor argues that deracialized accounts of violence produce seemingly innocent White witnesses whocan consume these spectacles of domination without confronting their own complicity in such acts.The author suggests that remembrance practices require critical rethinking if we are to confront vio-lence in more effective ways.Key words: gender; identity; racism; transphobia; memorialization; narrative; activism; queer politicsIn the last 9 years, Transgender Day of Remembrance(TDOR) has become a significant political event amongthose resisting violence against gender-variant persons.Commemorated in more than 250 locations predominantlythroughout North America but also in Europe, Australia,New Zealand, South America, and Southeast Asia, this dayhonors individuals who were killed due to anti-transgenderhatred or prejudice (Transgender Day of Remembrance[TDOR], 2005c, 2006b). Although various memorial activ-ities are organized at a grassroots level, most of these eventsare linked through two sister websites: the RememberingOur Dead project (http://www.rememberingourdead.org/about/core.html), which records transgender deaths, and theofficial TDOR site (http://www.gender.org/remember/day/), which provides educational resources and publicizestransgender vigils occurring around the world (TDOR,2005e, 2006d). Projects of the nonprofit organizationGender Education & Advocacy, both websites providevital tools for local community mobilization and play aninfluential role in shaping transgender remembrancepractices worldwide (Gender Education & Advocacy,2003a).1 Indeed, these projects have played a crucial role inAddress correspondence concerning this article to Sarah Lamble, AHRC Research Centre for Law, Gender & Sexuality, KentLaw School, Eliot College, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent CT2 7NS, United Kingdom. E-mail: s.r.lamble@kent.ac.uk1 Although some websites include independent informationabout Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDOR), mostprovide a direct link to either the Remembering Our Deadproject or the TDOR website. See, for example, CrisalideAzione Trans Nazionale (2002a); Gay, Lesbian and StraightEducation Network (2007); Gay Straight Alliance Network(2006); Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation(2007); National Organization for Women (2004); Press forChange (2007); Support Transgenre Strasbourg (2005);Vancouver Transgender Day of Remembrance (2006).Because the TDOR website posts more than 25 educationalresources, including sample flyers, press releases, banners,and instructions for organizing remembrance vigils in schoolsand communities at the local level, its influence is evident inmemorialization efforts elsewhere. Recent postings onYouTube (Victoria, 2006), for example, titled “TransgenderDay of Remembrance Tribute—Part 1” and “Transgender Dayof Remembrance—Part 2,” rely exclusively on the TDORwebsite for their content and use the language verbatim.

Despitetheir importance as resources for activism, the TDOR web-site and the Remembering Our Dead project are nonethe-less limited in the scope of their analysis of the factorscausing violence against gender-variant individuals and ofthe potential responses to such violence. By focusing ontransphobia as the definitive cause of violence, the websitesdo not fully contextualize incidents of violence within theirspecific time and place, thus obscuring the ways in whichhierarchies of race, class, and sexuality situate and consti-tute such acts. In the process, transgender bodies are uni-versalized along a singular identity plane of victimhoodand rendered visible primarily through the violence that isacted upon them.Taking the TDOR/Remembering Our Dead project asa case study for considering the politics of memorializa-tion, as well as tracing the narrative history of the FredF. C. Martinez murder case in Colorado, I aim to demon-strate how deracialized accounts of violence produce seem-ingly innocent White witnesses who can consume thesespectacles of domination without confronting their owncomplicity in such acts. Without addressing violence as asystemic effect of power, I argue that current manifesta-tions of TDOR potentially limit the possibilities forresisting racialized gender violence in meaningful andeffective ways.This article is not written to denigrate the importantwork of activists who struggle against violence,2 nor is itto suggest that we should abandon remembrancepractices that honor those who have suffered fromviolence. Such practices serve multiple purposes andmark important forms of collective healing, communitygathering, and public denunciations of violence. Rather,this article critically questions the politics of who and howwe remember, interrogates the implications of speakingon behalf of the dead, and examines what is at stake in takingup particular kinds of remembrance practices. I argue thatif we3 are to engage in effective struggle against violence,we must resist remembrance practices that rely on reduc-tionist identity politics; we must pay attention to the spe-cific relations of power that give rise to acts of violence;and we must confront violence in its structural, systemic,and everyday forms.Narratives of remembrance are not merely problemsof representation. The stories we take up in remembranceare constituent practices: They tell us who we are andhow we know the world. As Roger Simon (2005) noted,“Practices of remembrance are questions of and for his-tory as a force of inhabitation, as the way we live withimages and stories that intertwine with our sense of lim-its and possibilities, hopes and fears, identities and dis-tinctions” (p. 3). In other words, narratives as practices ofremembrance have material effects on the social orderingof relations of power and the ways in which we come toknow ourselves in relation to the dead. These effects areneither politically neutral nor socially inconsequential:“In these practices of remembrance, there is a prospectiveorientation that seeks to legitimate and secure particularsocial relations, making normative claims on the conductof human behaviour” (Simon, p. 4). Underlying this arti-cle is more than a debate about what version of a story istold, how particular persons are presented, or who isincluded and excluded—I wish to address a broader con-cern about what kinds of spaces for resistance narrativesof remembrance help create and how those narrativesdetermine the boundaries and possibilities for enactingchange.Decontextualized Violence: DeracingTransgender BodiesThe Remembering Our Dead project was founded bytrans activist Gwendolyn Ann Smith in response to thedeath of Rita Hester, an African American transwomanwho was murdered in her Massachusetts apartment inNovember 1998. Concerned that deaths of transgenderpersons were poorly documented and quickly forgotten,Smith began gathering and publicizing information abouttransgender deaths so that trans communities wouldbetter know their own histories (Smith, 2000, 2001,2 This article arose from my own involvement inTransgender Day of Remembrance and my participation asa nontrans person in ongoing struggles against trans-related oppression. I wrote this piece cautiously; I do notwish to replicate the history of nontrans persons who havecritiqued, demonized, and pathologized trans struggles. Atthe same time, I take seriously the call for self-reflexivitywithin activism and my analysis emerges from concernsraised within my local trans and genderqueer communitiesabout the overall effectiveness and broader implications ofcurrent manifestations of Transgender Day ofRemembrance.3 I recognize that some readers may feel excluded from, orwish to remain outside, the various significations of the wordwe as I use it in this article. Although my use of we does pre-sume readers’ general interest in working to end oppressiveviolence, I do not intend the term to denote inclusion orexclusion of any specific community. Rather, I invite readersto participate in the process of self-reflexive questioning ofremembrance practices.March 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 25SEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 262003). In November 1999, Smith organized the firstTDOR, a candlelight vigil in San Francisco. Now an annualevent, TDOR has become “the largest multi-venue trans-gender event in the world” (Smith, 2003, ¶ 3; TDOR,2006a).As part of the ongoing Remembering Our Dead pro-ject, a small group of volunteers compile and record thename, date, location, and cause of death for trans-relatedmurders worldwide. As of November 2007, the listincluded 378 individuals (TDOR, 2007).4 The compre-hensiveness of the list is no doubt limited by an unavoid-able reliance on mainstream media sources, whichconsistently fail to provide thorough reporting on trans-gender deaths, as well as reports from law enforcementofficers, which often reflect inadequate responses toviolence against transgender persons (Moran & Sharpe,2004). Indeed, as Smith (2000) noted, “The media’s reluc-tance to cover our deaths lies near the heart of this project”(¶ 3). Chronic underfunding and limited resources withintransgender communities poses further challenges to theproject, and the emotional burden of collecting this infor-mation can be high (Smith, 2001). Nevertheless, the pro-ject is a collaborative one, with international appeals forreports and strong links with a range of gender-relatedsocial justice organizations (Remembering Our Dead,2006a, 2006b, 2006d). Likewise, many of the resourcesposted on the TDOR website are produced by other alliedgroups in the United States, such as the Gay, Lesbian andStraight Education Network, the Gay-Straight AllianceNetwork, and the Transgender Law Center (TDOR, 2005d,2006c).The TDOR website acknowledges that “not everyperson represented during the Day of Remembrance self-identified as transgendered—that is, as a transsexual,crossdresser, or otherwise gender-variant—[but] eachwas a victim of violence based on bias against transgen-dered people” (TDOR, 2004b, ¶ 2; 2005c, ¶ 2). Both theTDOR website and the Remembering Our Dead project arethereby explicit in privileging transphobia as the exclusivemotivation for violence: “Over the last decade, more thanone person per month has died due to transgender-basedhate or prejudice, regardless of any other factors in theirlives [italics added]” (Smith, 2000, ¶ 5; TDOR, 2005c, ¶ 3, 2006b, ¶ 3). Evident here is a deliberate effort toisolate transphobia from any other form of prejudice orcause of violence. From this vantage point, other factorsare deemed not only to complicate our understanding ofviolence, but also to pose a threat to the legitimacy of theproject’s political goals. The authenticity of the cause issecured through the authority of a particular community:The murder list includes “only those deaths that are knownto the transgender community or that have been reportedin the media” (TDOR, 2004b, ¶ 1). But who makes up thiscommunity that determines who will be remembered?Who is the subject we are asked to remember?The answers to these questions are not simple. First,there is no clear consensus on what constitutes transgen-der, let alone transgender community. Emerging in theearly 1990s as an umbrella term to include a multiplicityof gender experiences and practices that transgressdominant norms of gender expression (including trans-identified persons who use medical interventions toexpress their gender and those who do not, cross-dressers,pan-gendered people, intersex persons,5 two-spiritedindividuals, etc.), the term transgender has been broadlyused as an identity around which gender-variant individ-uals could gather and organize political strategies.6 Theterm also emerged in resistance to pathologizing labelsimposed by the medical establishment and in contestationof the trivialization of gender-variant behavior in popularculture. However, fierce debates persist on how the termshould be used, whom it includes—and what proximity ithas to queer, gay, lesbian, and bisexual organizing (Califia,1997; Currah, 2006; Feinberg, 1996; Moran & Sharpe,2004; Namaste, 2005; Phelan, 2001; Valerio, 2002).These debates go beyond simple semantics and strike atthe root of political struggles revolving around citizenshiprights and protection from harm. For individuals whosemembership in a particular group can greatly affect their4 Several lists of transgender murders are available online.However, the most comprehensive and widely cited list ismaintained on the Remembering Our Dead (2006c) andTransgender Day of Remembrance (2007) websites.5 Although intersex persons are often included within thescope of transgender struggles, a consensus is emergingamong gender activists that intersex issues and transgenderissues, though related, should not be conflated (Currah,Juang, & Minter, 2006; Intersex Society of North America,2006).6 Leslie Feinberg (1996) attributed the first use of transgender to Virginia Prince, who coined the term in thelate 1980s as both a self-description and a way of describingpeople who “trans the gender barrier [but] not the sex barrier” (Feinberg, p. x). Prince was attempting to find aname for people who live in a gender that is not traditionallyassociated with their assigned gender at birth, yet differfrom transsexuals by not seeking anatomical changes throughsurgery or hormones. The term transgender sometimesstill is used to differentiate between those who seek medicalinterventions and those who do not, but now is understoodmore widely as an umbrella term. SEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYclaims to medical care, protection from violence, and legalrecognition of identity, the stakes are high.7These divisions over who is included in the commu-nity resurface within projects such as TDOR, wherebelonging through victimhood is the platform for politi-cal agency. For example, the 1993 high profile murder ofBrandon Teena8 sparked fierce sectarian battles amongtransgender, transsexual, and lesbian and gay activists,who each wanted to claim this murder as an attackagainst their own kind (Halberstam, 2005; Hale, 1998).A similar example can be found in the 1996 murder ofthree sex workers in Toronto who were shot withinhours of each other by Marcello Palma. Two of the vic-tims, Deanna/Thomas Wilkinson and Shawn Keagan,were identified as cross-dressers and are listed on theRemembering Our Dead website as victims of transpho-bic violence. Yet they are also included in Douglas Janoff’s(2005) recent inventory of homophobic violence inCanada. From a third camp, Mirha-Soliel Ross and VivianeNamaste (2005) maintained that these deaths arose fromantiprostitute and class-based discrimination, anargument based on the fact that the perpetrator describedstreet people and prostitutes as scum and demonstratedno clear evidence of transphobia.9 Similarly, Ross andNamaste noted that Grace Baxter, a fully passable, post-operative transsexual sex worker who is also listed on theTransgender Remembrance website, was killed by a johnwho was unaware of her trans status. Ross thus denouncedTDOR as “a big, bold and sickening political fraud” (quotedin Namaste, p. 92).Within this political framework of claiming victims,activists—whose struggles are ultimately linked—canbecome ensnared in what Razack and Fellows (1998)described as competing marginalities. In this model, justiceclaims rest on proof that one group is not only mostoppressed but also most innocent; that is, the group inquestion must convey itself as bearing no responsibility inthe oppression of others (Razack & Fellows). Identitiesare thus marked as constituting so-called good and bad vic-tims, and these categories tend to fall along particularclass, gender, and racial lines. The supposedly perfectvictim is the one who is believed to be most pure, innocent,and helpless—typically the White, middle-class girl child.It is not surprising, then, that Matthew Shepard andBrandon Teena, both marked as young, White, barely mas-culine (and, in Shepard’s case, also middle-class), havebecome the poster children for protesting homophobicand transphobic violence.10 In contrast, cases involvingvictims of color, prostitutes, and street people are rarelynoticed, particularly by mainstream media, politicians,and service organizations (Ott & Aoki, 2002). When lessideal victims are taken up by the media or championed bypolitical groups, undesirable facts or complex dimensionsof identity are often omitted from the story so as to producea good-victim narrative. By predicating political strategieson innocent victimhood, violence against individuals whodeviate from the ideal becomes less visible and more tol-erable. Consequently, “those who are the most severelyaffected victims of sexism and racism (e.g. prostitutes orteenaged black males in the juvenile justice system) qual-ify least as ‘genuine’ victims of crime” (Simon, 2000,p. 1132). Hence, the claims of the most privileged groupsare advanced through the disavowal of other groups’ claims.Activists, no doubt, have strategic reasons why theycontinue to employ this tactic. As Razack and Fellows(1998) noted, “One reason we feel compelled to secure our7 For example, when legal definitions of transgender identityrequire surgery or hormones as proof of transition, individu-als who are unable or choose not to pursue such medicalinterventions may be denied gender-appropriate identifica-tion on key documents, such as passports, drivers licenses,birth certificates, and health cards. Individuals whose identifi-cation papers conflict with their self-expressed gender presen-tation may be denied vital social services and can be at higherrisk for state-based harassment and violence. Similarly, if astate has human rights protections based on sexual orienta-tion but not on gender identity, or vice versa, the decision toclaim one particular identity over another can affect whether aperson is eligible for legal remedy against discrimination.8 I use the name Brandon Teena here because it is the mostcommonly recognized name. However, as Jacob Hale(1998) carefully documented, the identity of the individualwho is popularly known as Brandon Teena was far morecomplicated than most accounts convey. It is not clearwhether this individual used the name Brandon Teena orfirmly identified within any single identity category.9 I would argue that this case is more complicated than whatwas presented by any of the previously noted accounts; theevidence suggested that class, race, gender, and sexualitywere all factors in the murder. Although one might assumethat the issue of race is only in operation when the victim orperpetrator is non-White, such a view fails to understandthe logic of racial oppression. As many critical race scholars(see, for example, Delgado & Stefancic, 1997; Dyer, 1997;Frankenberg, 1993; hooks, 1992; Leonardo, 2004) havedemonstrated, Whiteness is not simply the absence of race,but the site of a racial identity that renders itself invisiblethrough its status as the norm.10 The racial identities of both individuals are nonethelesscomplex. Qwo-Li Driskill (2004) noted, for example, thatBrandon Teena was of mixed White and Sioux Indianancestry. Although the significance and meaning of thisheritage warrant further discussion, Driskill rightly pointedout that  the Native American dimension of BrandonTeena’s identity is rarely acknowledged in queer and trans-gender accounts.March 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 27SEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 28gruesome details of violence, which are repeated at vigilsand reiterated through the remembrance archive, havestrong visceral impact; we do not remember the names ofthe victims so much as we remember the violence that wasdone to them. Just as Western feminism’s historicalreliance on a universal female victim has tended to definegender as what is done to women, the gender identity oftrans people is signified by what is done to their bodies(Razack, 2001). Deliberately unmarked by race, class,age, ability, sexuality, and history, these individuals—otherwise unknown—are rendered visible solely throughthe violence that is enacted upon them. The very existenceof transgender people is verified by their death. Violencethus marks the body as belonging to the trans community.In this way, violence simultaneously obliterates andproduces a particular trans subject—both materially (inthe act of killing) and symbolically (in the subsequentnarration).Defined by the details of brutality, violence is reducedto the snapshot of a crime scene, a momentary fragmentin time between perpetrator and victim. Without historyor context, the systemic roots of violence are renderedinvisible; violence is comprehensible only at the microlevelwhereby individual transphobia becomes the only viableexplanation. Besides being incomplete, this pictureundermines the scope of antiviolence efforts. Severalscholars have illustrated the problem of using phobias asa primary explanation for violence (Spade & Willse, 2000).As Gary Kinsman (1996) noted of homophobia, “Itindividualizes and privatizes gay and lesbian oppressionand obscures the social relations that organize it” (p. 33). Hence, the trans murder victim emerges as theproduct of an individual hatred or fear rather than theresult of the accumulative effect of social institutions (suchas legal, economic, and political systems) that are foundedon, and perpetuate, complex hierarchies of power andviolence (such as White supremacy, patriarchy, andheteronormativity).By accumulating a collective list of murder victims,the TDOR website does make efforts to demonstrate thatacts of violence against transgender people are not iso-lated events. One of the educational handouts, titled“Anti-Trans Murder: Over One A Month” (TDOR, 2002),conveys the frequency with which such violence occurs. Yetthe prevalence of murders is provided as further evidenceof widespread transphobia, an idea that invariably returnsto individual perpetrators as the root cause of violence.This analysis is confirmed by the handout’s conflation ofjustice with individual punishment and retribution: “Thosewho are caught seldom receive sentences commensuratewith their crimes. In over 200 cases, only one suchown place on the margin as the most oppressed is that notto do so is to risk erasure” (p. 339). This concern is a vitalone for trans people, whose invisibility—induced by dom-inant power relations of sex and gender norms—makes itdifficult for them to secure such basic rights and servicesas heath care and housing. Historically treated as freaksof science, sources of entertainment, or fodder foracademic theorizing, trans people struggle to definevisibility on their own terms (Namaste, 2000). Evenamong groups who claim solidarity with transgenderpeople, tokenism and exclusionary practices persist(Namaste, 2005; Phelan, 2001). Within this context, thereis “much pressure to conform to the totalizing and essen-tializing dimensions of identity if claims of access toresources and demands for recognition of citizenship oftransgender people are to have the gloss of legitimacy”(Moran & Sharpe, 2004, p. 412). Moreover, when theurgency of addressing violence is coupled with limitedresources, time pressures, and media demands for sound-bite politics, the simpler, more rhetorical strategies caneasily win out over complex and nuanced analysis.Not surprising, then, is that the political narrative ofTDOR has been reduced to a singular cause (transphobia)and a singular identity (victim of transphobic violence).The website achieves this narrative not only with its self-description but also through the remembrance archiveitself. The list of victims in the archive includes noinformation on the age, race, class, ability, or particularcircumstances of each individual who was murdered—nor is any such information provided about the people whocommitted each crime, even when the perpetrators areknown. Although a handful of victim profiles include aphoto of the person, most include only a generic silhou-ette image (TDOR, 2005f; 2006e).11 Each case isabstracted from its history and context: Each murder isdecontextualized and reabsorbed within a unified narra-tive and a universalized body of the dead trans subject. Thenarrative encoding of gender violence dovetails with anarrative decoding of racial violence, class violence, andsexual violence. Within this framing, each individual deathcan stand in and be substituted for another; difference issubsumed within sameness.Because the archive provides so few details about eachcase, the cause of death becomes the most powerful markerof inclusion within the community of remembrance. The11 My drawing attention to the prevalence of silhouetteimages is not meant as a critique of the project organizers,who, as I noted previously, do not have the resources tofind photographs of every victim listed on the site. Rather,my emphasis here is on the narrative effects of such images.SEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYmurderer is currently on death row, and just two othersare serving life sentences” (TDOR, ¶ 4). The wordingsuggests that justice would be better fulfilled if moreperpetrators were given life—or death—sentences. Indeed,the Remembering Our Dead project actively supportsharsher penalties for transgender-related hate crimes(Gender Education & Advocacy, 2003b).Such so-called solutions, however, fail to confrontsystemic causes of violence (such as the criminal justicesystem itself) and ignore state complicity in authorizingviolence (Spade & Willse, 2000). As Wendy Brown (1995)aptly demonstrated, the call for such judicial responses“casts the law in particular and the state more generallyas neutral arbiters of injury rather than as themselvesinvested with the power to injure” (p. 27). Moreover,because hate crime claims require the entrenchment of afixed identity in order to prove a victim’s disadvantagedstatus, identities are reduced to stereotypical categoriesthat appear natural and immutable rather than as theeffects of power relations (Brown). In other words, asJonathan Simon (2000) put it, “The satisfaction thatcomes from avenging oppression caries the price ofreinforcing the very categories of the original victimiza-tion” (p. 11). Consequently, the TDOR website’s efforts toillustrate the rifeness of violence are undermined by itssingular focus on transphobia.The overarching political narrative of transphobia,however, is not absolute; it is destabilized by the highlyracialized visual imagery conveyed through photos on thewebsite. Educational handouts and other resourcesinclude photos of selected murder victims, a majority ofwhich depict non-White faces. Of the names listed, manyare non-Anglo, and several are accompanied by a paren-thetical pronunciation key (e.g., “Julio Argueta [HOO-lee-o ar-GET-tah]” [TDOR, 2005a, p. 3]), which speaks toa White Anglo audience presumed to be unfamiliar withsuch names. Marked as racialized others, these namesand faces both reinforce the website’s narrative norm ofWhiteness and contest its totality. Against the politicalnarrative that denies racialized violence, these photo-graphic images suggest that race cannot be ignored.12Hence, two overlapping discourses are at work: thenarrative voice of the activist cause, which refuses toformally acknowledge race, and the visual messages—captured by the names and the photos of racializedothers—which explicitly call on race as a marker ofvictimhood. Yet these discourses do not operate with equalcognitive effect. The activist narrative (which, arguably,saturates the entire site) is overtly teleological, relying ona coherent story line of cause (transphobia) and effect(violence), with death marking the moment of truth at theend of the story. By contrast, the racialized images, whichare scattered randomly throughout the site, operate at amore subconscious, yet nonetheless vivid level; they hoveras a ghostly reminder of the dead, a lingering specter ofrace. Because these images are few in number, their visualforce is particularly striking against the text-heavy website,further highlighting the significance of race even as raceis formally written out of the official activist narrative.These seemingly conflicting messages work symbioticallyto produce both a naturalized White subject and a bru-talized body of color. The website’s photos depictingactivists—seen at vigil ceremonies, marches, and speech-making events—predominantly comprise White faces,whereas the victim profiles depict predominantly peopleof color (TDOR, 2005b, 2005c, 2006b, 2007). When theseimages are juxtaposed, White activists are positioned assaviors of victims of color. In this way, the brutalized bodyof color is called upon to advance a political agenda thatreinforces racial hierarchies at the same time as it disavowsthe significance of race (Razack, 2001).Although the deracialized narratives of the TDOR/Remembering Our Dead project emerge from a particu-lar political strategy, they are also the product of a broadersocial context that promotes individually focused andlegally oriented responses to violence. In particular,because corporate media are the primary source of report-ing on violence and law enforcement is the primary mech-anism for redressing violence, these institutions play asignificant role in setting the stage for activism. Forexample, although antidiscrimination and hate crime lawin the United States and Canada have been stronglycritiqued for their repeated failure to address multiple,intersectional, and structural forms of oppression (see12 A few online lists of transgender deaths explicitly note theracial identity of victims, highlighting the significance ofrace. For example, of the 51 individuals included onGenderPAC’s (2007) list of murder victims, 37 are identifiedas persons of color, the vast majority of which are AfricanAmerican and Latina transwomen. In its 2006 report onkillings of transgender youth between the ages of 13 and 30, GenderPAC explicitly noted that 91% of the victims werepeople of color and the majority were economically poor.However, by claiming that “if federal law mandated the FBIto track gender-based hate crimes, they would outweighevery other category except race” (and providing a graphicthat compared hate crime murders based on race, genderidentity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, and disability),the report nevertheless divided race from other dimensionsof identity and risked succumbing to the politics of competingmarginalities (GenderPAC, 2006, p. 2).March 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 29SEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 30Crenshaw, 1989; Ehrenreich, 2002; Grabham, 2006;Spade & Willse, 2000), legal responses are still treated asa key remedy for violence. Because raising publicconsciousness is a key activist strategy, the naming powerof hate crime legislation (i.e., identifying violence as per-petrated against specifically oppressed groups) remainspolitically appealing (Spade & Willse). In seeking suchrecognition, however, activists must adhere to the state’slimited criteria and logic for identifying and prosecutinghate crimes. Similarly, because corporate media are oftenthe first source of reporting about violence, such sensa-tionalized accounts can set the tone for subsequentnarratives. The Fred (F. C.) Martinez murder case, forexample, shows how law enforcement agencies andmainstream media shape the terms by which activistsrespond to and recount incidents of violence. Tracingthese narratives, one can begin to see the depth to whichderacialized accounts of violence are socially embeddedand collectively authorized.The Erasure of Race in the Fred (F. C.) Martinez MurderOn June 21, 2001, the brutalized and decomposingbody of 16-year-old Fred (F. C.) Martinez was found in ashallow canyon on the outskirts of Cortez, Colorado.Martinez, a Navajo high school student who identified asopenly gay and transgender, suffered blunt-force traumato the head, as well as cuts to his abdomen and wrists. Itwas reported that on the night of June 16, 2001, Martinezhad been chased by his attacker to a desolate, rocky areaknown as the Pits, run into a barbed wire fence, struck inthe head with a rock, and left to die (Quittner, 2001).Shaun Murphy, a White 19-year-old from Farmington,New Mexico, subsequently pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, after witnesses reported him braggingthat he had “bug smashed a joto [Spanish derogatoryslang for a gay or effeminate male]” (Emmett, 2001i, ¶ 11).At the onset of investigation, Montezuma CountySheriff Joey Chavez stated that detectives were “lookingat the boy’s sexuality, as well as the fact that he was NativeAmerican, as possible motives in the crime” (Emmett,2001b, ¶ 13). But race quickly disappeared as a relevantfactor. District attorney Joe Olt refused to prosecute themurder as a hate crime, treating the case as though theseverity of the physical violence was all that mattered. AsOlt explained to the local press: “We’re looking at it as amurder that is heinous enough.…To me, a murder is a hatecrime” (GenderPAC, 2001a, ¶ 3).The failure to treat the crime as legally hate motivatedwas widely attributed to the fact that Colorado’s crime-biaslegislation (Ethnic Intimidation Act of 1988) did notinclude sexual orientation or gender identity as groundsfor special prosecution (Colorado State General Assembly,2005). The fact that the legislation included race, color,and ancestry was considered—by both news reportersand victim-advocacy groups—irrelevant (Emmett, 2001e;GenderPAC, 2001a). Some news reports even impliedthat Colorado had no hate crime legislation at all (ColoradoAnti-Violence Program, 2001b; GenderPAC, 2002;Heidelberg, 2002).13 The outrage over the Martinez mur-der was subsequently channeled into lobbying efforts toreform Colorado’s bias-crime statutes to include sexualorientation—changes that were successfully adopted in2005 (Colorado State General Assembly, 2005; LambdaLegal, 2001).14 When the Martinez case received briefnational attention, it was attributed to the antigay and anti-transgender dimensions of the crime, and not at all to fac-tors of race (Colorado Anti-Violence Program, 2001a;Mimiaga, 2002). When the story hit national news feed-ers via the Associated Press, Martinez’s Navajo identitywas not even acknowledged (Gay and Lesbian AllianceAgainst Defamation [GLAAD], 2001). The farther thestory traveled, the more race disappeared.Although most regional press stories tacitly notedMartinez’s Navajo identity, few articles considered it morethan a supplementary detail. The controversy insteadfocused on whether the case constituted a hate crime and,if so, whether it was motivated by homophobia or trans-phobia; either way, race was deemed largely inconse-quential. Although Martinez’s mother, Pauline Mitchell,repeatedly described racism as a factor in her son’s deathand the subsequent legal proceedings, this perspectivewas mostly absent from the press coverage. Aside frompublic statements made by the Two Spirit Society ofColorado (which were mainly ignored in the mainstreampress), even victim advocacy groups did not specificallydiscuss race.15 In almost all accounts, sexuality and gender13 Technically, the Ethnic Intimidation Act (1988) did not,at that time, include the term hate crime, but it effectivelyserved the same purpose. Where crimes were shown to bemotivated by particular forms of bias, stiffer criminalpenalties could be applied (Ethnic Intimidation Act).14 In every annual legislative session since 1994, lobbyistshad introduced legislation that would enhance penalties forviolence motivated by prejudice against the victim’s sexualorientation, but the bills were defeated each time (TGCrossroads, 2002).15 Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD),a media advocacy group that assessed press coverage of thecase, did criticize news media that did not includeMartinez’s Navajo identity in their coverage. However, theorganization nonetheless did not make race a central pointof analysis.SEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYconsistently eclipsed race as an important factor in thecrime. By the time the Martinez case reached the TDORwebsite, the issue of race was completely absent. Thewebsite currently memorializes the case as “Fred Martinez,Jr. (aka Fredericka, F.C.). Cortez, Colorado. 16-Jun-01.Bludgeoned to the head” (TDOR, 2007, p. 25, ¶ 9).16A careful examination of the case, however, clearlydemonstrates that racialized hierarchies of power were inoperation before, during, and after the murder. Martinez’smother, Pauline Mitchell, described numerous incidentsthat she attributed to racism, many of which began longbefore her son’s death. Noting that Martinez was often atarget for harassment and violence at school, Mitchell feltthat school officials not only failed to protect her son butalso frequently blamed Martinez and subjected him toregular discipline (Quittner, 2001; TG Crossroads, 2002).As Mitchell described,He was sent home often. I would have to leave workto go pick him up because they sent him home somuch. The principle [sic] and vice-principle [sic]made so many complaints. Too many NativeAmerican kids are sent home from school.(GenderPAC, 2001b, ¶ 13)Mitchell recalled several occasions in which Martinezwas sent home from school for wearing what school offi-cials called gender-inappropriate clothing—incidents shebelieved were also racialized:One time, Fred went in wearing the same shoes thisother girl was wearing. They were sandals. Nike. Shedidn’t get sent home, but Fred did. I complained tothe school, but of course they aren’t going to listento me because I’m Native American. (GenderPAC,2001b, ¶ 14)Racial discrimination continued in the aftermath ofMartinez’s death. Although Mitchell reported that herson was missing on June 18, the police did not notify herwhen the (unidentified) body was first discovered onJune 23,17 nor did they inform her of the arrest andarraignment of Shaun Murphy. Mitchell learned of both,after the fact, from a newspaper (GenderPAC, 2001b;Lambda Legal, 2001).18 When she complained to thedistrict attorney (DA) that it was her right to bear witnessfor her son at the court proceedings, he claimed that therehad been insufficient time in which to contact her(Emmett, 2001g). Apparently, however, there had beenample time to notify Murphy’s family: His mother, grand-mother, girlfriend, and daughter were all present at thearraignment (Lambda Legal). Requesting that she be keptinformed of any details of her son’s death, Mitchell wassubsequently assured by the DA that she would be notifiedwhen the autopsy was complete. However, the policereleased the autopsy results to the media without inform-ing Mitchell; she learned about the gruesome details of herson’s murder in a newspaper (Emmett; GenderPAC;Human Rights Campaign, 2001). Mitchell also expressedconcerns that the police had not investigated the crimescene adequately. When she examined the site herself,Mitchell found evidence that police had not removed,including some of her son’s hair, which was matted withblood (Human Rights Campaign). For Mitchell, thedisrespectful treatment by police was symptomatic ofracism (GenderPAC). Describing another indignity, shenoted:When they had Fred’s body bagged, I wanted tolook at his body, to make sure. When they showedit to me, they had left a bunch of blood and rubbergloves with him. It hurt and it made me mad. Theywere willing to leave these gloves and blood likethis with my baby. They treat me this way becauseI’m an Indian. (GenderPAC, 2001b, ¶ 23)Later, when she was at the police station, she notedthat “all the Native Americans have handcuffs on them,even leg-cuffs. But white kids and Shaun, they havenothing on them. They can move around freely. It’s justnot right” (GenderPAC, 2001b, ¶ 23).Mitchell subsequently filed a formal complaint withthe governor’s office that her rights had been violated16 Although this description is consistent with that of theother deaths listed on the website (i.e., racial identity isgenerally excluded for all murders noted on the list), itremains an important factor in tracing how this narrative ofviolence become deraced as it circulated in various medianetworks.17 According to Mitchell, she reported her son missing onJune 18, 2001, phoned in to follow up 2 days later, and thencalled again on June 23 when she read in the newspaperthat a body had been found near her home. The sheriff’soffice denied Mitchell’s claims, saying that she only filed amissing persons report on June 23, 2001 (Emmett, 2001g).18 According to the sheriff’s office, when the body was firstfound, its decomposed state made it difficult to determinehow the individual had died, how long the body had beenthere, or “even the ethnicity of the man” (Emmett, 2001a, ¶ 4).Despite the state of the body, the sheriff’s office nonethelessconcluded that the body did not match any missing personsreports from the area. According to Detective Kalvin Boogs:“Every one (missing-persons report) that we have receivedin the last year we’ve already ruled out” (Emmett, ¶ 6).Given the lack of clear identifying evidence, it seems oddthat the police would rule out so quickly a missing personsreport that had been made only a few days prior. The factthat no mention of a missing youth was made at the timesuggests that Mitchell’s report of her missing son either wasnot on the minds of police or had been ignored.March 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 31SEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 32the person rather than in the social context, we are ableto ignore our role in producing it” (p. 21). In no way didMitchell deny the factors that marked her son as differ-ent, but she recognized that such differences are alwaysrelational; otherness can be understood only against itsnorm. In this way, Mitchell insisted on situating her son’sdeath within its broader social context and thereby calledon collective responsibility for such oppression.The differences that marked Martinez as being othercannot be understood independently from each other. AsIris Marion Young (1997) pointed out, “The absurdity of try-ing to isolate gender identity from race or class identitybecomes apparent if you ask of any individual womanwhether she can distinguish the ‘woman part’ of herselffrom the ‘white part’ or the ‘Jewish part’” (p. 13). Likewise,when a boy is accused of being a fag it is not only his sexualitythat is in question, but also his masculinity: He is perceivedas being not man enough. As Viviane Namaste (2000)argued, “Gender is a cue used to locate lesbians and gaymen” (p. 141). But gender is not simply mistaken for sexu-ality or vice versa; the two are read through one another andconstitute each other’s logic. Even the most hypermasculineman will be accused of failing to be a real man if he is gay,just as an assuredly heterosexual male will be accused of notbeing straight enough if he is in any way effeminate.In the same way that gender and sexuality areproduced symbiotically by and through each other, so israce constituted by the logic of gender, sexuality, andclass. Martinez was attacked not simply because he failedto embody proper masculinity and heterosexuality;Martinez did not conform to a certain kind of heterosexualmasculinity—namely, White, middle-class, able-bodiedheterosexual masculinity. Masculine heterosexuality isnot a universal, abstract hegemonic ideal; it is contextu-ally bound, ordered by time and place. Black masculin-ity, for example, is not governed by the same standardsas White masculinity. Just as gender is a cue for sexual-ity, so is race a cue for sexuality, gender, and class. As GailMason (2002) argued, “Categories of gender, race and/orsexuality do not just intersect with each other in incidentsof inter-personal violence. Rather, they are the ‘vehiclesof articulation’ for each other” (p. 61). For these reasons,we cannot say that Martinez was killed primarily becausehe was gay and transgender but also because he wasNavajo and poor; this additive approach fails to accountfor the ways in which the racial and class dimensions ofidentity are produced by and through the other. Raceand class do not simply complicate violence—they enableit (Razack & Fellows, 1998). Indeed, race and class, likegender and sexuality, are also constituted through vio-lence (Smith, 2005).under Colorado’s constitutional law. Under the state’sVictims Rights Act, the surviving family of a deceasedvictim has the right “to be informed of and present for all‘critical stages’ of the criminal justice process” and “to betreated with fairness, respect and dignity” (ColoradoDepartment of Safety, 1993, ¶ 2; Lambda Legal, 2001, ¶3). Shunning Mitchell’s allegations that the violation of herrights had anything to do with her son’s sexuality orethnicity, the DA stated glibly: “If you’re thinking that [itwas intentional]—don’t” (Emmett, 2001h, ¶ 13). AlthoughPauline Mitchell described these experiences as specificallyrelated to her Navajo identity, the racial dimension of hergrievances was absent from news reports. Even the advo-cacy organizations that supported Mitchell’s formalcomplaint nonetheless treated race as a secondary factor;her son’s sexuality and gender identity was consistentlyhighlighted as the key issue in the case (Emmett, 2001g;GenderPAC, 2001b; Lambda Legal).19Contrary to the media narratives, Mitchell refused toreduce her son’s death to a single cause. When asked whyher son was killed, she stated repeatedly that it wasbecause he was different (Emmett, 2001f; GenderPAC2001b; Quittner, 2001). According to Mitchell (2002):F.C. [Martinez’s nickname] had many difficult timesin his short life. Much of this was related to the factthat he was Navajo living in a world that does nothonor and respect different ways, and also that hewas Nadleeh—Two-Spirit—and he could comfort-ably walk the path of both male and female, that hewould love differently from most. F.C. also felt thepain of what comes when your family is poor, butvery proud. It is not easy to grow up as Navajo,Nadleeh and poor. (¶ 4)Mitchell’s statement describes how race, gender,sexuality, and class hierarchies collectively constituted thecircumstances of her son’s death. At the same time,Mitchell (2002) refused to reduce these factors to simpleidentity labels. For Mitchell “labels mean nothing—andthey meant nothing to F.C. He used these terms to makeother people comfortable, not himself” (¶ 1). By rejectingthese labels, Mitchell eschewed a logic that would reducedifference to an inherent quality about her son. As Razack(2001) argued, “When difference is thought to reside in19 Unlike most reports, GenderPAC did make explicitreference to “reports of racism” (2001a, ¶ 1–2) as a“persistent theme” (2001b, ¶ 2) in the police treatment ofMartinez’s mother and noted intersecting identities asfactors in the murder. Nonetheless, accounts of the casestill report that “the dominant theme surrounding Fred’smurder has been his gender and sexuality” (GenderPAC,2001b, ¶ 2). SEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYThe interlocking nature of oppression can beunderstood in the particular context that situated the rela-tionship between Martinez and Murphy. In an earlierencounter on the night of June 18, 2001, Murphy and afriend, Clint Sanchez, picked up Martinez after seeinghim at a party and all went out for pizza. After they haddropped off Martinez, Sanchez asked Murphy whetherhe thought Martinez had assumed they were gay (Emmett,2001d; Quittner, 2001). This question, unremarked on bythe media, is significant because it speaks to the economyof desire that arose in that encounter. The questionverbalizes a possibility that Murphy and Sanchez mighthave been thought to be gay. In this way, the questionspeaks to a forbidden desire not only between men but alsobetween Whites and racialized others. In this moment,Murphy’s heterosexuality, masculinity, and Whitenesswere simultaneously threatened—with serious conse-quence. To be misread as gay is not a trivial mislabelingof identity, but a significant disruption of the dividingline between self and other. Indeed, false accusations ofhomosexuality not only are considered slanderous enoughto spark civil litigation cases but also have been usedsuccessfully as a defense (known as the gay-panic defense)in several murder trials (Ott & Aoki, 2002). Becausesexuality cannot be dislodged from racial and gender iden-tity, this moment of desire threatens to undo the racial,gendered, and sexual ordering of Murphy’s social identity.In a context in which White, heterosexual masculinity isdominant, the proximity of desire that arises in thisencounter with the other strikes at the heart of the straightWhite male’s sense of self. To maintain his sense of self,Murphy had to disavow this desire; he accomplished thisdisavowal through violence (Pinar, 2003).Murphy’s actions following his attack on Martinezconfirm the role violence plays in securing a sense of self.In returning to his friend’s apartment and proclaiming thathe had “bug smashed a joto” (Emmett, 2001i, ¶ 11),Murphy declared neither shame nor remorse, but pride.His statement was a way of recording what he had done,to claim the violent act as his. To brutalize another andrecount it with pride is an exercise in identity formationthat reaffirmed Murphy’s sense of self as dominant andsuperior. Violence radically re-marked the boundarybetween himself and the other; no longer could the otherthreaten to engulf him by desire. Murphy reaffirmed whohe was: masculine, dominant, White, whole.Murphy’s reassertion of identity through violencewas not simply a moment of individual psychologicalcrisis—it was also rooted in broader social forces. Both theinstability of identity itself, which drives the incessantneed for its reassertion, and the impetus to secure aprivileged position through violence are consequences ofhierarchical power relations. Murphy’s own history, forexample, was marked by previous acts of violence,repeated conflicts with the law, and difficulties in school(Emmett 2001c; TG Crossroads, 2002). First expelledfrom school in the sixth grade and subsequently oustedfrom two high schools, Murphy was labeled a trouble-maker from a young age. According to the principal of oneschool, Murphy “was considered by state law as ahabitually disruptive student. He was one of those kids youjust don’t know about” (Emmett, ¶ 11). In a context inwhich educational and legal systems respond to problembehavior through labeling, expulsion, and punishment, itis not surprising that Murphy projected these experiencesonto others; institutionalized social exclusion arguablybreeds further acts of marginalization. Indeed, Murphy’sbehavior extended a pattern of oppression wherebyattempts by one group to overcome social exclusion arechanneled through subjugation of another.20Further evidence suggests that the encounter betweenMurphy and Martinez was a colonial one. That Murphychased Martinez into an isolated area known as the Pits isnot insignificant.21 A place where teenagers go to party andsmoke marijuana, this zone is marked outside the bound-aries of the civilized city; it is a space of social, economic, andlegal abandonment. As Razack (2001) noted, “The citybelongs to the settlers and the sullying of civilized society20 Murphy’s last name, which marks him as bearing Irishheritage, signals a much longer history of struggle for racialbelonging. As Noel Ignatief (1996) argued, when IrishCatholic immigrants first came to the United States, theirattempts to shed oppressed status in Ireland and attainWhite privilege in America meant racially distinguishingthemselves from non-Whites. “Having fair skin made the Irish eligible to be white, but it didn’t guarantee their admission. They had to earn it” (Postel, 1997, ¶ 21).Irish-Catholic immigrants collectively earned this White(working class) status, argued Ignatief, by disavowing thestruggles of Blacks in the United States, and by participatingin the oppression of non-Whites.21 The evidence is not entirely clear on this point, in partbecause Murphy recounted three different versions of whathappened that night (Heidelberg, 2002). Murphy claimedthat Martinez attacked him and so he struck Martinez withthe rock in self-defense; in one version of this story, he saidthat Martinez chased him to the Pits, not the other wayaround. In another version, Murphy claimed that the twohad met in the Pits, at which point a fight ensued. However,the evidence from the autopsy—namely the types of cuts onthe body—suggested that Martinez had run into a barbedwire fence while being chased (Quittner, 2001). Moreover,there was no evidence to demonstrate that the fight wasmutual—Murphy suffered no injuries. By contrast, theautopsy noted extreme blood loss and a fractured skull asamong the causes of Martinez’s death (Emmett, 2002).March 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 33SEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 34through institutionalized violence. Reflecting this legacy,the Two Spirit Society of Colorado released a formal statementacknowledging that Martinez’s murder was not an iso-lated incident, but part of the historic violence againstNative Americans. Mitchell concurred: “I will tell you[that] here in Cortez, too many Indians die. They just let itgo and nothing is done about it” (GenderPAC, 2001b, ¶ 31).Mitchell’s statement suggests not only that the deathsof Indians are common (and, therefore, not isolatedincidents) but also that such deaths are socially autho-rized and enabled by the community, the law, and thestate. In this light, we cannot isolate Martinez’s death fromthe harassment and violence that he experienced on a dailybasis—acts that were endorsed by school authorities(through their disciplining of Martinez) and permitted bymembers of the community (who did nothing about theharassment). Martinez’s death can be seen as an extensionof that everyday violence. Alan Cook, an openly gaypsychotherapist who assisted Martinez following a suicideattempt 6 months prior to the murder, noted: “I did notunderstand the gravity of [Martinez’s] sense of malaiseabout his safety. I am a middle-class white male, and Ididn’t have insight into the part of the community that isyoung and Navajo and gay” (quoted in Quittner, 2001, ¶ 5).Although some would argue that the 40-year jailterm to which Shaun Murphy was eventually sentenced isevidence that Martinez’s death did not go unnoticed, themedia coverage suggested that this response was mainlyowing to the public outrage over what was perceived as anattack spurred by homophobia, not a case of racializedviolence. More important, however, the sentence doesnot call into question the structures of power that enabledthe murder in the first place. As the sole bearer of respon-sibility, Shaun Murphy became the scapegoat that allowedothers to deny complicity. By assigning blame to anindividual, the social hierarchies of power that give rise tosuch violence are left fully and forcefully intact. Thesentencing process gives the state an opportunity toconfirm the official story: that violence is an exceptionalmoment, not an everyday one. Doing justice in the formof Murphy’s sentence reinstalled the narrative thatviolence is the act of a lone killer, not the consequence ofa system of racial, gender, class, and sexual hierarchies.When responsibility belongs to a single perpetrator, therest of us are positioned as innocent bystanders.Producing Innocent Onlookers: Spectacle andWitness as ComplicityAs long as violence is attributed to the single act of anindividual, the role of the witness—the one who is left toremember—is rendered innocent. At most, our duty asthrough the pretence of the racial Other in white spacegives rise to a careful management of boundaries withinurban space” (p. 129). Indeed, the location of Martinez’smurder outside the city proper reflects this colonial order-ing of space; such violence further constitutes the wilder-ness as a place of savagery. Known as a tiny frontier town,Cortez is characterized not only by deep racial divisionsbut also by its boundary line against the half-million inhab-itants of the neighboring Navajo territory (Quittner, 2001).As Murphy chased Martinez to the outskirts of town, he lit-erally drove an Indian outside the bounds of civilization andcloser to the reservation. Against a long history of WhiteAmericans forcing the Diné people from their land, when aWhite man chases a young Navajo to the edges of the fron-tier, brutally beats him, and leaves him to die, how can wenot see this encounter as a colonial?22Indeed, Mitchell understood her son’s death in thiscontext: not as a singular attack by one individual againsther son, but as part of a long history of colonial oppression.The sexualized, racialized, and gendered dimensions ofthe violence that Martinez experienced are certainlyconsistent with the legacy of colonization. As Andrea Smith(2005) powerfully demonstrated, sexualized violence isdeeply embedded in, as well as constitutive of, colonialrelationships. Colonization required careful managementof gender and sexual relations, a task achieved largely22 Navajo history is characterized by government-inflicteddisplacement, abuse, and environmental racism. Mostnotably, in 1864, the Navajo were interned by ColonelChristopher Carson at Fort Defiance, Arizona, and thenforce-marched, in what is known as the Long Walk, 300miles in mid-winter to Bosque Redondo, New Mexico(Churchill, 1998; Iverson, 2002). Confined there for 4years, the Navajo endured substandard living conditions,abject poverty, and starvation. By conservative estimates,the Diné lost half of their population during this ordeal(Churchill). Although the Navajo people eventually werepermitted to return to a reduced area of their territory, theU.S. government continued to exercise colonial control overthe territory through economic exploitation. In the 1940s,discovery of uranium deposits in the Navajo territory led toa massive mining project in support of nuclear testing.Between 1946 and 1968, more than 13 million tons ofuranium ore were mined on Navajo territory, resulting inradioactive contamination of the local water supply. In the1980s, the Navajo Health Authority documented unusuallyhigh rates of birth defects among babies born in mine-adjacent areas; other studies found higher rates of miscar-riages, infant deaths, birth defects, and learning disabilities(Churchill). Under the Navajo-Hopi Relocation Act of 1974,the United States sought to remove 13,000 Diné from theBig Mountain region in Arizona to turn the land over to thePeabody Coal Company. The history of the Navajo reserva-tion was also scarred by forced sterilization and residentialschools characterized by widespread sexual abuse(Churchill; Smith, 2005)SEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYwitnesses is to spread awareness. This orientation isreflected in the George Santayana quote that prefaces theRemembering Our Dead portal on the Gender Education& Advocacy website (http://www.gender.org/): “Thosewho cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it”(n.d.). But as Simon and Rosenberg (2005) argued, memo-rialization practices that function as warnings or simpleobject lessons are insufficient to dislodge our own com-plicity in deep-seated patterns of violence:On such terms, initiating and participating inremembrance defines one’s own responsibility asone of educating others (since one already knowsabout the events in question), a practice that toooften and too easily slides into a postponement ofwhat one needs to do oneself. (pp. 84–85)Without critical reflexivity, the exercise of educat-ing others serves to entrench a sense of self that isbeyond reproach. Those who know and educate arepositioned as morally superior to those who are igno-rant; we congratulate ourselves for our political aware-ness without moving outside the comfort zone of moralauthority and self-knowing. Such positions of moralsuperiority are usually classed and raced: The well-educated, supposedly enlightened White subject is jux-taposed against the ignorant redneck, the high schooldropout, the presumably backwards ethnic other (Ott &Aoki, 2002).Our innocence as witnesses is also secured throughoutpourings of public sympathy. Particularly when weare called to remember those whom we did not know per-sonally, we are invited into a community of shared griefand called upon to experience a sense of collective sym-pathy. But, as Susan Sontag (2003) argued, “So far as wefeel sympathy, we feel we are not accomplices to whatcaused the suffering. Our sympathy proclaims ourinnocence as well as our impotence” (p. 102). In this way,sympathy is seductive. By recognizing the pain of others,we tell ourselves, we engage in a shared sense of humanity.We identify with the other through the recognition of ourown pain. But in doing so, we risk appropriating another’spain for our own purposes—or, as Razack (2007) calledit, stealing the pain of others.When the deracialized narrative of Fred Martinez’smurder is held up to further the transgender cause, thepain of colonial violence is erased and usurped and theracialized nature of oppression is obscured, allowingwitnesses to deny the ways in which hegemonic Whitenessis enacted and sustained through violence. In other words,in such accounts, the witnesses uphold the myth of Whiteinnocence. Perpetuating this narrative of power, thewitnesses are also constituted by it; in this sense, thewitnesses become White. This process of White witness-ing is, of course, never stable or absolute, particularly forracialized witnesses, who are already constituted as notWhite even as they are ushered into a White narrative.Indeed, the social and political effects of a racializedwitness engaging in a White discourse (which ultimatelymarks the further pain of silencing, erasure, and assimi-lation), is different from the effects for a subject whoseWhiteness is being reaffirmed and reprivileged throughthat discourse. Yet the overall effect is one that enablesWhite complicity; 23 the narrative allows Whites to denythe ways in which we/they enable and benefit from theongoing legacy of colonial and racialized violence. Whitewitnesses do not have to consider the ways in whichour/their daily practices contribute to, authorize, oruphold racialized power relations that enable violence.Such witnessing thereby uses the pain of others to reaffirma sense of self.This process of witnessing is evident in a remem-brance ritual whereby the living speak for the dead. Amongthe resources provided by the TDOR website is a set offirst-person narratives. For example:My name is China Zainal (CHI-na zy-NALL), and Iwas a forty-six year old Indonesian-born sex workerliving in Sydney, Australia. On November thirtiethof two thousand and three, two witnesses saw mestaggering down one street before collapsing inanother. They called an ambulance, which took meto St Vincent’s Hospital. I died at the hospital fromnine stab wounds to the neck and upper torso.(TDOR, 2004a, p. 1)I’m Mylène [mee-LEN], a 38 year old transsexualborn in Ecuador, and living in France. On March26th, my body was discovered in a room in a hotelnear the center of Marseilles [mar-SAY]. My throatwas cut — as were my genitals. (TDOR, 2005a, p. 2)My name is unknown, but I was Chinese or EastMalaysian, and living in Kuala Lumpur. On the 11thof November, my body was found head-first in a23 By complicity, I do not mean to suggest direct involve-ment or intentional collaboration with acts of violence;rather, I refer to less visible and more mundane actionsthat nonetheless contribute to structural injustice orperpetuate social processes that enable violence. If violenceis socially produced, then responsibility must be sociallyenacted. I am not saying that responsibility is equallyshared, but suggesting that it cannot be reduced to individ-ual accountability or simple questions of moral obligation.Rather, responsibility must be structurally oriented,socially connected, and collectively enacted (Veitch, 2007;Young, 2006).

Police revealed that there was asingle slash wound on the neck and numerousbruises on my body. (TDOR, 2005a, p. 4)Presumably, these biographies are designed to beread at vigils in order to make individual deaths morereal to those bearing witness. But what does it mean tospeak for the dead in this way? Is this how these indi-viduals would want to be memorialized, by the grue-some details of their death? In taking the voice of theother as our own, we colonize the bodies of the dead.These narratives speak not to the honoring of life, but tothe fetishization of death. Once again, the violent actitself—and not the social conditions that facilitate vio-lence—takes center stage. The details of these killingspander to an imagination that is enticed by images ofshock and suffering. Thus, death becomes spectacle andthe horror of violence eclipses the humanity of thosewho have died.The spectacle of violence undermines the antivio-lence cause by sensationalizing brutality, objectifying thedead, and exploiting raw emotion. This is not to minimizethe importance of mourning and grief, particularly forthose who have lost a loved one—rituals of remembrancecan be important practices of healing and support.However, the closeness of pain that arises from personalgrief cannot be confused with the distanced emotions thatare generated through the consumption of spectacles ofviolence. As Simon, Di Paolantonio, and Clamen (2005)noted, spectacle “is not a thing, it is not an event or evena particular representation of an event.…Rather specta-cle is a particular mode of attentiveness.…It is a way ofentering the significations of social” (p. 143). Throughthis mode of attentiveness, we experience the narrative ofviolence while still maintaining a position of exteriority:The projections and identifications made withinspectacle, and the consequent defences it elicits,both require and enact leaving ourselves intact, ata distance, protected from being called into questionand altered through our engagement with thestories of others…Our attentiveness while not“inactive,” is compliant; it does not engage in thepraxis of making and re-making our historicalconsciousness. (Simon et al., p. 144)As Martinot and Sexton (2003) argued, “Spectacle isa form of camouflage. It does not conceal anything; itsimply renders it unrecognizable. One looks at it and doesnot see it” (p. 174). One might look at Martinez as Navajo,but not see the way in which his murder is racialized. Inthis way, spectacle invites us to read particular narratives“on the terms of the moral certainties we hold dear,allow[ing] us to disavow any requirement that the termson which we are moved might throw ourselves intoquestion, into destabilization” (Simon et al., 2005, p. 144).This process constructs the gaze as innocent, one that isfascinated, pleasured; the onlooker is overcome by bothgrief and gratification—but, either way, the witness bearsno responsibility.In this context, evoking sympathy serves to advancethe agenda of a privileged few at the expense of others. AsRoss described TDOR,It sure makes for a powerful street performance:candles, tears, hugs, and snuggles over cardboardpictures of butchered members of a marginalizedminority produces emotionally charged images. Butit functions, both theatrically and politically, tobenefit a privileged subsection of the trans com-munity. (quoted in Namaste, 2005, pp. 92–93)Such practices have concrete material consequences.As Jacob Hale (1998) argued, “When a border zonedenizen’s corpse is claimed by those with firmer categor-ical location, border zones become less habitable for thosewho are trying to live in the nearly unspeakable spacescreated by overlapping margins of distinct categories” (p. 319). In other words, when the complexity of identityis denied or ignored for political gain, those whose livesdo not conform to easily politicizable identities have evenless space in which to express themselves, make politicalclaims, and confront oppression.Remembrance practices also inform the politicalpriorities of social movements, generating further mate-rial consequences. Because remembrance narrativesdefine problems of violence on certain terms, they directlyinfluence the kinds of solutions proposed in response.For example, when the bulk of an advocacy group’s fundsare used to lobby for hate crime legislation rather than toadvocate for transgender prisoners, or for increasedcommunity policing rather than decriminalization of sexwork, or for corporate employee benefits rather thanuniversal health care, it is often low-income people ofcolor who lose. For this reason, activists have an obliga-tion to continuously examine how their political strategiesaffect those who are most disenfranchised. If the mostprivileged within the community benefit at the expense ofthe most marginalized, such strategies are not worthpursuing.Conclusion: Remembering OtherwiseThe narrative erasure of racialized violence in theTDOR/Remembering Our Dead project is arguably notisolated, but symptomatic of broader racial hierarchieswithin transgender politics. The first National Survey ofSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYdisplaced by gender, its deployment will inevitably fail asa political strategy because such a usage denies the inter-locking character of hierarchical systems of oppression(Razack & Fellows, 1998). I am suggesting not that transidentity should be abandoned as a basis for political-organizing but that its usage must be recuperated from aderacializing logic. Given propensities among transactivists to contest binaries between masculinity andfemininity, surely there is ample room to rethink experi-ences of violence beyond either-or categories.Although this article traced a single murder case toshow how its inclusion within TDOR was predicated on aderacialized narrative, I would argue that the same processof tracing race can be undertaken for each case. By reduc-ing violence to a single cause, the TDOR/RememberingOur Dead project not only obscures the social, political,and historical context of violence but also forecloses on thepossibilities for resistance. When justice is reduced tomounting simple awareness campaigns on the one hand,or calling for stiffer sentences on the other, we fail toaddress the structures of power that enable violence in itseveryday and mundane forms. Underlying these responsesis a liberal plea for tolerance—a plea that locates violencein the sphere of individual attitudes. These strategies notonly create an environment of competing marginalities butalso limit the possibilities for meaningful politicalsolidarity. When violence is reduced to transphobia alone,only those who identify as transgender can have a realstake in trans politics; others who take up the cause cando so only from a position of charity or from a basis ofsympathy rather than shared struggle and collectiveresponsibility. Such a delineation limits the possibilityfor political affinities grounded in an understanding thatoppressions are inextricably linked.Despite these critiques, I am not suggesting that weshould cease remembering those who are commemoratedby the Remembering Our Dead project. As Simon (2005)noted, “The task of working for social transformation is notto forget the past, but to remember it otherwise” (p. 9). Thequestion, then, is How do we remember otherwise? Whatwould it mean to remember in such a way that confrontsstructural violence (i.e., processes of domination that aresocially, politically, and economically instituted over time)and requires examination of our own complicity? Simonprovided a useful starting point:Remembering otherwise will proceed from thosepractices of remembrance whose over-ridingconsideration is the question of what it might meanto take the memories of other (memories formed inother times and spaces) into our lives and so live asthough the lives of others mattered. (p. 9)Transgender Violence (Wilchins, Lombardi, Priesing, &Malour, 1997) in the United States, for example, failed toadequately discuss race. Although the racial identity ofvictims and perpetrators were included in the datacollection, this information was obscured by the paper’soverall analysis, which isolated transphobia from otherfactors (Moran & Sharpe, 2004; Wilchins et al., 1997).Likewise, the story line of Boys Don’t Cry, the award-winning film about Brandon Teena, was deliberately dera-cialized; one of the murder victims—Philip DeVine, adisabled African American—was purposefully left out ofthe narrative.24 The fact that DeVine was dating the sisterof Brandon’s lover, Lana—a White woman—as well asthe fact that one of the murderers had affiliations withWhite supremacist military groups, was deemed irrelevantto the larger context of the triple murder (Halberstam,2005). When questioned on her decision to excise DeVinefrom the screenplay, filmmaker Kimberly Peirce suggestedthat the racial dimension would have overcomplicatedthe plotline. In doing so, as Judith Halberstam pointed out,Peirce not only denied DeVine’s racially charged death butalso failed to recognize how race was a key factor inBrandon’s death as well. Such denials of racialized violencedovetail with the deracing of mainstream transgenderhistory. For example, the famous Stonewall Riots were ledby Black and Latina drag queens, yet popular represen-tations of this history are frequently deraced (Feinberg,1996). Similarly, some of the most well-known and popularheroes of the transgender movement—Leslie Feinberg,Kate Bornstein, Pat Califia, Riki Ann Wilchins, andBrandon Teena—are read as White.The pervasive denial of race within some transactivism calls into question current conceptions of trans-gender identity categories, particularly in struggles againstviolence. As Moran and Sharpe (2004) noted,The use of the term ‘transgender’…needs to betreated with some caution, having the potential toreduce our understanding of the nature of theviolence and the experience of those who are thetarget of this violence to a uniform phenomenon.(p. 401)If the political usage of trans identity requires thatrace, class, ability, and sexuality be subordinated or24 DeVine was removed not only from the narrative itselfbut also from the film’s original dedication, which read, “ToBrandon Teena and Lisa Lambert.” Because the dedicationreferences actual facts more directly than the narrativeitself, this decision to leave out DeVine selectively presentsa true-life tale as though DeVine did not exist at all(Halberstam, 2005).March 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 37SEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICYMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 38Such a response demands “an attentiveness to anotherness that resists being reduced to a version of our ownstories” (Simon et al., 2005, p. 135).Remembering otherwise may require a rethinking ofthe political uses of narrative itself. Although narrative canplay a vital role in giving voice to those who are marginal-ized, perhaps its deployment in particular contexts comesat too high a cost. Perhaps activists and academics mustfurther interrogate the political logic of narrative, whichorganizes time, place, and identity in particular ways,thereby opening up some political possibilities butforeclosing on others (White, 1980, 1984). In somecircumstances, we might seek out narrative forms that aremore open, flexible, and fluid, drawing on narrativeexpressions that resist totalizing messages or reduction-ist identity claims. In others, we might reject narrativealtogether and choose alternative modes of communica-tion from which to launch our political demands. Eitherway, we must be attentive not only to the content of ourpolitical claims but also to their form.There are signs of hope. For example, organizers ofa recent Transgender Remembrance Vigil at the 519Community Centre in Toronto made explicit efforts toaddress violence against trans people within its broadercontext of oppressions. Flyers circulated to promote theevent read:The Trans Day or Remembrance ceremony at The519 provides an opportunity for trans/two-spirit/gender-queer people and their allies to gathertogether to gain strength, to educated, and to per-form an act of resistance. While most “TransgenderDay of Remembrance” events internationally focuson “anti-transgender violence” we here at TransProgrammes at The 519 are choosing to acknowl-edge not only transphobia as a root cause of violencein our community, but also to specifically mark thevarious forms of oppression in our culture thatincrease violence and limit protections for manymembers of the trans community. These includeracism, ageism, ableism, stigma against sex-workers, classism and homophobia.Although the language could go further in acknowl-edging the interlocking nature of oppression, the flyernonetheless demonstrates a move in the right direction.Similarly, the ceremony itself made efforts to celebrate thelives of transgender people rather than sensationalizetheir deaths. Our task, then, is to push these effortsfurther—not only with respect to TDOR but also in themany ways we recount and confront violence. None of usare innocent. We must envision practices of remembrancethat situate our own positions within structures of powerthat authorize violence in the first place. Our task is tomove from sympathy to responsibility, from complicity to reflexivity, from witnessing to action. It is not enoughto simply honor the memory of the dead—we must trans-form the practices of the living.AcknowledgmentsMany thanks to Sherene Razack and my fellowstudents in the graduate research seminar on Race, Violenceand Law, at the University of Toronto, 2006, whose rigor-ous discussions contributed enormously to this article.Thanks also to Transgender Day of Remembrance orga-nizers in Toronto and Peterborough, whose knowledge andexperiences inspired my analysis.

    "abstract": "Transgender Day of Remembrance has become a significant political event among those resisting violence against gender-variant persons. Commemorated in more than 250 locations worldwide, this day honors individuals who were killed due to anti-transgender hatred or prejudice. However, by focusing on transphobia as the definitive cause of violence, this ritual potentially obscures the ways in which hierarchies of race, class, and sexuality constitute such acts. Taking the Transgender Day of Remembrance/Remembering Our Dead project as a case study for considering the politics of memorialization, as well as tracing the narrative history of the Fred F. C. Martinez murder case in Colorado, the author argues that deracialized accounts of violence produce seemingly innocent White witnesses who can consume these spectacles of domination without confronting their own complicity in such acts. The author suggests that remembrance practices require critical rethinking if we are to confront violence in more effective ways",
