Since 2019, our annual national surveys have been among the largest and most diverse surveys of LGBTQ young people in the U.S. For the first time ever, we’re publishing the findings of our national survey, which captured the experiences of nearly 34,000 LGBTQ people ages 13-24 across the United States in 2022, segmented by all 50 states. These data provide critical insights into the suicide risk faced by LGBTQ young people, top barriers to mental health care, the prevalence of anti-LGBTQ victimization, and the negative impacts of recent politics. Importantly, this research also points to ways in which we can all support the LGBTQ young people in our lives by detailing per state LGBTQ young people’s access to accepting communities, LGBTQ-affirming spaces, and social support among family and friends — protective factors that are consistently associated with better mental health and lower suicide risk. It’s essential to emphasize that because we still do not have known counts or registries of the LGBTQ youth population comprehensive data on the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ youth remains limited. These findings strive to underscore the unique challenges faced by young LGBTQ people, a group consistently found to be at significantly increased risk for suicide because of how they are mistreated and stigmatized in society.We hope that LGBTQ young people in every state will see themselves reflected in these experiences that so many have bravely shared; and that these data will equip fellow researchers, policymakers, and other youth-serving organizations in every state with the data necessary to celebrate and uplift LGBTQ young people and advocate for policies that work to end the public health crisis of suicide. 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health Alabama3  |  2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health by StateMental Health & Suicide Riskin AlabamaLGBTQ young

State@TrevorProject @TheTrevorProject www.TheTrevorProject.orgThe Trevor Project’s mission is to end suicide among LGBTQ young people. We provide 24/7 crisis services for LGBTQ young people via a phone lifeline, text, and chat. We also operate innovative research, advocacy, public training, and peer support programs.Crisis Services AdvocacyPeer SupportResearchEducation andPublic AwarenessMethodologyA quantitative cross-sectional design was used to collect data through an online survey platform between September 20 and December 31, 2021. A sample of individuals ages 13 to 24 who resided in the United States was recruited via targeted ads on social media. No recruitment was conducted via The Trevor Project’s website or social media channels. Respondents were defined as being LGBTQ if they identified with a sexual orientation other than straight/heterosexual, a gender identity other than cisgender, or both. In order to ensure the representativenessof the sample, targeted recruitment was conducted to ensure adequate sample sizes with respect to geography, gender identity, and race/ethnicity. Qualified respondents completed a secure online questionnaire that included a maximum of 143 questions. Questions on considering and attempting suicide in the past year were taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey to allow for comparisons to their nationally representative sample.

    "abstract": "The Trevor Project, the leading suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ young people, produces innovative original research that amplifies the experiences of diverse LGBTQ young people and brings new knowledge and clinical implications to the suicide prevention field.Since 2019, our annual national surveys have been among the largest and most diverse surveys of LGBTQ young people in the U.S. For the first time ever, we're publishing the findings of our national survey, which captured the experiences of nearly 34,000 LGBTQ people ages 13-24 across the United States in 2022, segmented by all 50 states.These data provide critical insights into the suicide risk faced by LGBTQ young people, top barriers to mental health care, the prevalence of anti-LGBTQ victimization, and the negative impacts of recent politics. Importantly, this research also points to ways in which we can all support the LGBTQ young people in our lives by detailing per state LGBTQ young people's access to accepting communities, LGBTQ-affirming spaces, and social support among family and friends — protective factors that are consistently associated with better mental health and lower suicide risk.It's essential to emphasize that because we still do not have known counts or registries of the LGBTQ youth population comprehensive data on the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ youth remains limited. These findings strive to underscore the unique challenges faced by young LGBTQ people, a group consistently found to be at significantly increased risk for suicide because of how they are mistreated and stigmatized in society.We hope that LGBTQ young people in every state will see themselves reflected in these experiences that so many have bravely shared; and that these data will equip fellow researchers, policymakers, and other youth-serving organizations in every state with the data necessary to celebrate and uplift LGBTQ young people and advocate for policies that work to end the public health crisis of suicide",
