Now that she is back, she is focused on making RWU feel like a welcoming hometo LGBTQIAP+ students.Since 2009, Porcaro has lived mostly out of state: she graduated from George Mason Universitywith a bachelor's degree in peace studies and con\u0000ict resolution; she earned a master's degree inhigher education and student a\u0000airs from Virginia Tech. Then, Porcaro stayed out of state for work,most recently as the student a\u0000airs case manager at the University of North Carolina Asheville.Through all of this, Porcaro held on to a desire to return to home, and put all the skills andknowledge she’d gained during her years away in a role that could make a di\u0000erence to people -especially members of the LGBTQIAP+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual,10/31/2018 Modeling Possibilities: Q&A with RWU’s Coordinator for LGBTQ Programs Gabriella Porcaro | Roger Williams Universityhttps://www.rwu.edu/news/news-archive/modeling-possibilities-qa-rwus-coordinator-lgbtq-programs-gabriella-porcaro 2/4pansexual, or questioning) community.Now back in Rhode Island, as RWU’s coordinator for LGBTQ programs, Porcaro has the opportunityto do just that by helping the university continue its work in creating an inclusive and proactivecampus environment for its LGBTQIAP+ community.Re\u0000ecting on her role and how RWU is serving its LGBTQIAP+ community, Porcaro recently satdown for a Q&A:If there’s one message you want the campus community to take from the creation of your rolewhat is it? With the creation my role - and roles like the chief diversity o\u0000cer – I hope folks see that ouruniversity is truly committed towards creating a more diverse and inclusive campus for all students,faculty and sta\u0000. I hope folks recognize that there’s an energy here, and that we are not going to becomplacent - that we are going to do better. And that we are committed to listening to folks whohave been impacted by issues of race, gender or sexuality and \u0000nding ways to educate ourselves sothat we are on the bleeding edge of equity work on college campuses.What are the focus areas of your role?I see the three biggest focal points of my work as providing direct support to our students; being atrainer for faculty and sta\u0000 in order to help educate them on the concerns of the queer andtransgender community on campus; and as an internal consultant who looks at policies andprocedures around campus to make sure they are inclusive and not harmful to students.Can you tell me a bit about how you provide direct student support?With the direct student support piece, I support students that identify as queer or transgender. Imeet one-on-one with them, get to know and connect with them as a person, and also to just be anear for them. I also work with students who are actively involved in programs at the InterculturalCenter - where I'm based - and then also the larger RWU community of student leaders on campus.I’m actively engaged and help mentor a few student clubs and organizations on campus that aregeared toward issues of sexuality or gender. I also help guide other student groups to help themthink more critically on how to educate the campus and other students about identity concernsstudents from the queer and transgender community may face. Lastly, part of my role is beingpresent for student events and activities that matter to them, and where I can interact with them andsee their day-to-day life.Tell me about the faculty and sta\u0000 trainer aspect of your role.I’ll give you an example of what we have already been able to do. We relaunched the Safe ZoneProgram on campus, which is a three-tier training for faculty and sta\u0000 that seeks to explore whatgender and sexuality are. The \u0000rst training helps faculty and sta\u0000 understand language. There’s somany words associated with the queer communities that a lot of times folks are scared to askquestions or don’t know what a word means, so we address that head on and then that allows us toget into more practical pieces in the next trainings – where we get into what’s happening on10/31/2018 Modeling Possibilities: Q&A with RWU’s Coordinator for LGBTQ Programs Gabriella Porcaro | Roger Williams Universityhttps://www.rwu.edu/news/news-archive/modeling-possibilities-qa-rwus-coordinator-lgbtq-programs-gabriella-porcaro 3/4campus or what laws are coming down the pipeline that are directly impacting students. Forprofessors, this might mean starting to always think about what they can do to show students theyare always safe in their presence, even when they don’t know if they even have folks that are queeror transgender in their class. That’s the point of what I hope the Safe Zone trainings allow.It’s very easy to be reactive. To have a student come to you and say, ‘I’m feeling hurt and not feelingsupported.’ It’s a lot harder to look at a class of students and say, ‘I want to make sure I’m keeping allof these students safe from the start.’ My hope is to make everyone more proactive and mindful andcommitted to keep learning. Because if we all commit to keep learning, we are going to do betteras a community.What about your work as an internal consultant?I think my role can be used by faculty and sta\u0000 to analyze the policies and procedures that wealready have and how are they coming o\u0000 to the queer and transgender community. Folks havealready been inviting me in to see some of their forms or documents and even materials in theirlobbies or o\u0000ces to seek input on what kind of messages of support and equity they send to queerand transgender folk.How should LGBTQ students see your role and engage with you?I want students to see me as an advocate for them on campus. I want them to know that if theycome to me and talk to me about harm they experienced or ways that they are not being served, I’mgoing to advocate for change. The change might not be immediate or happen as quick as we allhope, but I want them to trust that I will be their voice.I also want them to see me as a possibility model [a term made popular by transgender advocateLaverne Cox]. I want them to see that success is possible. I think a lot of times, especially queer andtransgender folks, we’re told that our happiness - our success - isn’t possible in many ways.Especially when you look at a lot of the movies that come out or read a lot of the stories about whatit means to be a queer or transgender person. A lot of them are really tragic. I want them to see thatit’s not always going to be pretty and there’s going to be a lot of challenge, but happiness andsuccess are possible. I hope that their interaction with me will help them see that.How they should engage with me is however they see \u0000t. As I said, I’m trying to \u0000nd ways to bepresent with the larger student body as o\u0000en as possible. Already students are recognizing thatwhen my door is open they can just pop in and talk. I want that to continue.Lastly, are there any new initiatives or projects in the pipeline for the LGBTQIAP+ community?The Intercultural Center is opening a new space on campus called the Gender and Sexuality Centerin Maple Hall. The space is going to be dedicated to promoting gender equity work and work thatdeconstructs heteronormativity on and o\u0000 campus. I'm going to host a lot of my Safe Zone trainingsthere, and student organizations dedicated to advancing gender equity will host meetings there.10/31/2018 Modeling Possibilities: Q&A with RWU’s Coordinator for LGBTQ Programs Gabriella Porcaro | Roger Williams Universityhttps://www.rwu.edu/news/news-archive/modeling-possibilities-qa-rwus-coordinator-lgbtq-programs-gabriella-porcaro 4/4We hope to send the message that the space is a place where you come and commit to socialjustice work, particularly social justice work that is going to impact gender equity concerns and alsosexuality and romantic orientation concerns.Students, faculty or sta\u0000 interested in connecting with Gabriella Porcaro, coordinator of LGBTQprograms, can contact her at 401-254-5391 or gporcaro@rwu.edu.ACADEMICS LIFE @ RWU",
