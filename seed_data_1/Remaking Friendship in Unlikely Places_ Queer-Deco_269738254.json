The current prevailing models to explain and justify gender and sexual difference rely on understandings of selfhood that were developed in colonial, clinical, U.S., white, and middle-class cultural contexts. The cultural particularity of these most-accessible models has produced marginalization of queer and trans students and educators who have different understandings of gender and sexual difference. Queer-decolonial educators are individuals who are critical of colonial, Western understandings of gender, sexuality, and difference more broadly. These educators often work within contexts that do not allow them to draw explicitly upon the ways that personal experience, cultural legacy, and politicization shape pedagogy, which often limits abilities to connect with youth and students; conversely, these educators also often work outside of formal educational contexts, and thus, pedagogical approaches to teaching differences of gender and sexuality are often not well-documented nor institutionalized. Queer-decolonial educators work to understand the ways that diverse communities are receptive of, and resistant to, particular narratives of gender and sexual difference, often looking to legacies of legal, colonial, clinical, and social violence around gender and sexuality. The methodology and methods used for this study include   iii community-accountable research and qualitative interviews inspired by queer-of-color and Indigenous feminisms. In-depth interviews were undertaken with six queer-decolonial educators who historicized and theorized life experiences, elaborating themes of movement across contexts, familiarity with violence, refusals of homogeneity, and responsibility to legacy, as well as pedagogical efforts towards multimodality and intersectionality. These six educators also described the importance of addressing queerphobia, transphobia, and decoloniality simultaneously in the interests of refusing the production gender and sexual normativity, and place such refusals within critiques of racism, xenophobia, and settler colonialism, each crediting Indigenous epistemologies or life practices as foundational to remaking just worlds.                             iv      This dissertation, written under the direction of the candidate’s dissertation committee and approved by the members of the committee, has been presented to and accepted by the Faculty of the School of Education in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education.

Without their life-sustaining efforts, this work would have never been possible. I am grateful that my parents, Virginia and Eugene, chose to raise me in the Central Valley of California, a region that urges deep consideration of how one might live in proximity to racial, political, linguistic, national, and religious difference. My parents have always encouraged me and my siblings, Patrick and Alicea, to pursue higher education for no other reason than a love of learning. My family has supported me unconditionally through the process of my education, including Grandma Josie, who has tolerated my less-than-frequent visiting schedule during this past year of research and writing.   Dr. David Donahue, Dr. Monisha Bajaj, and Dr. Susan Katz, my dissertation committee members, have provided endless encouragement and immense practical guidance throughout this process of research, writing, and revising. Without their expertise, insights, and thoughtful comments, this document would not be what it is. I have greatly appreciated their openness to an exploratory topic and their willingness to engage with terrains of scholarship not usually incorporated into a dissertation within the field of education. I am also grateful to the USF School of Education administrative staff, who have been incredibly helpful and provided so much logistical support over the past five years, particularly Yunuen and Gabriela.    vi In high school, I had two mentors who had the unique ability to see through my unending skepticism. Sophia Smith, a two-time cancer survivor and daughter of a Holocaust survivor, was the first educator to take my penchant for philosophical thinking seriously. She introduced me to my first philosophy text during my senior year of high school and opened up an entire world for me. Claudia Shiuh, my violin teacher, provided me with my first example of what is possible between a teacher and student when a student is allowed to be a whole person, even when they are learning a specific skill or subject. Violin lessons often included tears, debates about whether music was science or art, breathing and stretching exercises, and venting. In between these moments of growing me as a person, she also helped me successfully audition for and matriculate in a prestigious music school for my undergraduate education.  The USC Readers tutoring-mentoring program in Los Angeles provided me with my first opportunity to serve as an educator in immigrant and working-class communities, a four-year experience that has shaped my approach to pedagogy since I was eighteen. The parents and students I worked with were incredibly patient with my semi-fluency in Spanish and ignorance of their struggles with immigration, documentation, language access, and more. I would particularly like to thank Azucena Mendez, who was a third grader I tutored in reading and writing, and who tutored me in the realities of a family living with mixed-documentation status. We have continued our mutual mentorship over the past fifteen years and Azucena has gifted me with concrete knowledge of just how impactful early educational experiences can be on a student’s life trajectory. Lasting relationships in education can develop when we allow both educators and students to be fully human.    vii   During my undergraduate tenure at the University of Southern California, I became seriously involved with LGBTQ+ student organizing efforts. It was there and then that I discovered a passion for the intersections of scholarship and activism. Student activism pointed me to broader community advocacy work, and in my upper division writing course, Dr. Ron Scheer took note of my voracious reading and potential for writing, and encouraged me to continue integrating the two. He provided me with my first opportunity to explore a social issue that was deeply meaningful to me and to practice crafting a written argument, and more importantly, a persuasive story that could capture people’s attention and focus it on an issue of educational injustice.   During my Master’s education, I had the immense fortune of studying with Dr. Angana Chatterji and Dr. Richard Shapiro, human rights scholars and advocates who deeply understand the links between experience, legacy, politics, and pedagogies of difference. Without their astute intellectual and political guidance, I do not know what my life would look like today. They also introduced me to those with whom I have maintained very close collegial relationships: Alejandro Urruzmendi, Pei-hsuan Wu, Tanisha Payton, Christina Mansfield, Heidi Andrea Rhodes, Ashley Kish, Amanda McArthur, Elizabeth Farmer, Jessica Hsu, Erin McElroy, and Pi’iali’i Lawson. Through the education we shared together, we often forgot that many of us were never meant to be friends.   I have worked full-time at the Family Violence Law Center throughout the completion of my coursework and dissertation in the USF School of Education. I am grateful to my FVLC family for their understanding as I juggled multiple responsibilities and six-day work-and-school weeks for a number of years. Many thanks to Erin Scott,   viii Ali Meyers-Ohki, Aja Holland, Era Steinfeld, Manisha Kaur Singh, Evelyn Soria, and the AmeriCorps volunteers I worked with. Their patience for my incessant curricular revisions, my non-stop critiques of mainstream anti-violence work, and my desire to push the boundaries of relevance for anti-violence education to reach more people has been unparalleled. Darkness (emotional and literal), laughter, hard work, exhaustion, long days, small victories, and more, could not have been shared with a better bunch. Particular gratitude is due to Era, who has shown me what it is to be a trans person who accepts nothing less than what she (and we) deserve.   I am grateful for the ten cohorts of anti-violence peer educators and their communities, who have taught me the importance of bringing everything I do and think “down to earth.” Working across language, history, different legacies of immigration and cultural loss, class, formal education levels, and more, has been the most powerful and most humbling experience of my life. Together, we found ways to develop shared language and frameworks for understanding gender and sexual difference, healthy relationships, and social justice. Without this on-the-ground experience, my scholarship and theoretical engagements would not be infused with the relevance and meaning they now have. Youth and students are not just the future; they are the “now.” Caring for them – and all their generational differences – is caring for ourselves, and vice versa.    Special thanks must go to Terry Lawrence and Jacqueline Garza Lawrence, elders and kin who have stepped into my life at a time when so many are telling me I have arrived at an end, and instead, they have offered me new beginnings and opportunities to return to a youthful space of learning, growth, and change. Uncle Terry and Tia Jacquie have helped me step more fully into a sense of responsibility for the legacies and   ix communities I represent and that live through me. The Three Arrows Family has provided me with new friendships and new reservoirs of support for ongoing, community-driven scholarship and advocacy.   Without the ongoing conversations with the research participants, this project would never have coalesced. I have known Fredrick, Harper, STS, JM, Desi, and Luz for anywhere between two and fourteen years. The collaboration, critical insights, encouragement, and curiosity of these six queer-decolonial educators power the ethics and rootedness of this research project. Their immense expertise and unwavering commitments to gender and sexual difference across culture, time, and place encourage me to continue articulating pedagogies of nuance and rigor. I cannot express how grateful I have been for their patience with my questions and reiterations of their words; I hope they can forgive any errors I have committed in the process of translating their practices and reflections into writing.  Nanea Renteria. She has re-introduced me to myself, and through our partnership, has helped me find the scholars and words to articulate knowledge that is at once philosophical, methodological, and ancestral. As she enters her own doctoral journey, I look forward to ongoing collaborations of thought, kitten-love, advocacy scholarship, and kinship building, as we continue to grow to our fullest potentials. I am ever so grateful for our shared journey through the cosmos, and how often she lights the way for us both. Nanea’s insistence on responsibility to land, ancestors, youth, elders, intergenerational healing, and more has shaped this research likely beyond my own comprehension.   x Finally, gratitude for Thomas A. Cat (2004-2018) and Oscar-the-Cat, who have both been rare, loyal feline companions, and who have taught me how to love friends that bite back, often unexpectedly.

past decade, queer and trans advocacy issues have garnered much attention in political, popular, and educational debates (Ahmed, 2012; Burdge, Licona, & Hyemingway, 2014; Gray, et.al., 2016). Support for these issues in the field of education has taken shape through legal advocacy, curricula development, educator trainings, and general awareness raising. The current prevailing models to explain and justify gender and sexual difference often rely on understandings of selfhood that were developed in colonial, clinical, U.S., white, and middle-class cultural contexts. The cultural particularity of these most-accessible models has had varied effects: access to advocacy and affirmation for youth who resonate with these models, alienation for those who don’t, marginalization of queer and trans educators who have different understandings of gender and sexual difference, and struggles within families and communities – often across generations – to make sense of new terms, concepts, and social and political moments of need.   Queer-decolonial educators are individuals who draw upon queer-as-politics, rather than queer-as-identity alone, who are also critical of colonial, Western understandings of gender, sexuality, and difference more broadly. Queer-as-politics is often the stance of queer-decolonial educators, as it assumes queer to be thoughtful political resistance to clinical and colonial heteronormative binary genders. We work in formal and informal contexts to welcome others into diverse understandings of queerness and transness, while also working to decenter the supremacy of U.S. settler, white, middle-class ways of knowing, including those related to gender and sexual difference.   2 Unfortunately, we often work within contexts that do not allow us to draw explicitly upon the ways that personal experience, cultural legacy, and politicization shape our pedagogies, which often limits abilities to connect with youth and students; conversely, these educators also often work outside of formal educational contexts, and thus, our pedagogical approaches to teaching differences of gender and sexuality are often not well-documented nor institutionalized.  Working in informal contexts, including in community, family, intergenerational, spiritual, and other learning environments, queer-decolonial educators also experience significant freedom to innovate and remake pedagogy so that it can contribute to the work of building solidarity within and across identities, communities, and generations. Many of these educators view their work as social, cultural, spiritual, and intergenerational healing work; however, these valuable perspectives and practices are often crowded out in the bustling field of queer and trans advocacy, particularly as many of these educators work in contexts where queer and trans education and advocacy is not the primary focus. Queer-decolonial educators work to understand the ways that diverse communities are receptive of, and resistant to, particular narratives of gender and sexual difference, often looking to legacies of legal, colonial, clinical, and social violence around gender and sexuality. This work is undertaken to better understand how queer- and transphobia operate in people of color, immigrant, working class, and Indigenous communities in unique ways. Background and Need for the Study California, particularly the Bay Area, is well-known for its legacy of – and current organizing around – efforts for gender- and sexuality-based human rights (Hanhardt,   3 2014); despite these longstanding legacies, challenges nevertheless persist. Queer and trans youth, particularly youth of color, low-income, and immigrant youth, experience discrimination in schools and communities at much higher rates than their non-queer and non-trans peers. Consequences of this discrimination include persistent mental health challenges, higher likelihood of drop-out and drug/alcohol self-soothing or escapism, increased risk of homelessness and intimate partner violence, funneling into the school-to-prison pipeline, as well as lower levels of access to relevant and meaningful curricular materials and mentorship in academic settings (Burdge, Hyemingway, & Licona, 2014; Burdge, Licona, Hyemingway, 2014; Kosciw, et.al., 2016; Palmer, Greytak, & Kosciw, 2016). Because many of the approaches to supporting queer and trans youth and students have been developed and proliferated by those in predominantly white and middle-class educational communities (Miller, 2016), the cultural particularities of these approaches have not been named or addressed in ways that might open them up to the different needs of youth of color, low-income, and immigrant youth who are also queer and trans.  Current advocacy around rights to gender and sexual difference for youth and adults focuses on rights to gender and sexuality self-identification in classrooms and other public settings, access to activities and facilities, inclusion in curricular materials related to history/social sciences (Donahue, 2014) and sexual health, responsive pronoun use, and access to clinical medical and mental health care for gender care and transition (Miller, 2016; Spade, 2015). These efforts are immensely important and great gains have been made in recent years (Romesburg, Rupp, & Donahue, 2014). Additionally, with advances in rights come backlashes, including the intensification of anti-queer and anti-trans legislative efforts to limit queer and trans youth’s rights to equitable educational   4 opportunities; these oppositional efforts often result in advocates leaning more heavily into problematic narratives of gender and sexuality to create simplistic public awareness messages of diversity-and-inclusion on the basis of a shared humanity, rather than framing difference as also deserving of rights (Miller, 2016).    While urgent and important work, much of the support for queer and trans youth and adults (including students and educators) relies on an individual’s self-identification as queer or trans, a feature of a developmental psychology narrative of self-actualization that is historically related to colonial narratives of cultural development from primitive-to-civilized through linear and universal notions of individual and group progress (Burman, 2016; Lesko, 2012); these historical and ideological connections will be explored in this research. Such culturally particular narratives of coming out often refuse to acknowledge other practices of gender and sexual difference that have long existed in people of color, Indigenous, low-income, and immigrant communities and cultures in California and beyond (Anzaldúa & Keating, 2015; Halberstam, 2005; Hurtado, 1999; Lorde, 2007; Luibhéid, 2005; Magana Mancillas & Balbuena Bello, 2010; Miranda, 2010; Roscoe, 2016).  Many queer and trans youth, adults, elders, students, and educators from these communities may not even use the terms queer or trans to label their self-understandings, and when they do with select people, are often not acknowledged as being queer or trans by those who come from white and middle-class backgrounds. Additionally, because people of color, low-income, immigrant, and Indigenous communities have commonly been portrayed as improperly gendered and sexually degenerate through xenophobic and classist assumptions of normative gender and sexuality (Canaday, 2011; Luibhéid, 2002;   5 Spade & Willse, 2014), many feel compelled to adhere to narrow boundaries of binary gender and heterosexuality in order to pass as deserving of humane treatment in public, private, political, and educational settings.  Without addressing the intersections of racism, classism, colonialism, genocide/eugenics, immigrant oppression (and assimilation), queerphobia, and transphobia simultaneously, organizing around queer and trans student and educator rights will be limited in reach and scope of analysis. Unfortunately, the community spaces, elders, mentors, and pedagogical tools available to these ends are sparse at best, and inaccessible or nonexistent at worst. Building solidarities across different understandings, experiences, and identifications of gender and sexuality is an essential part of working towards human rights – including access to education – for queer and trans students and educators from people of color, low-income, immigrant, and Indigenous communities. Incorporating intersectional frameworks of queer and trans advocacy will also steer efforts away from diversity-and-inclusion approaches, which often pressure students to fit into pre-existing models of recognizable identities (Ahmed, 2012). These models often do not account for many forms of difference that people and communities embody or experience, and often require that they choose between foregrounding either gender, sexuality, cultural, spiritual, or other identities, to the exclusion of the rest (Collins & Bilge, 2016).   The need for this study has emerged from calls to develop approaches to queer and trans advocacy that help to build solidarities across differences in gender and sexuality, and across generation, education levels, language, and culture. This work is important because of the immense intergenerational devastation that often occurs in   6 people of color, immigrant, working class, and Indigenous communities as a result of legacies of forced and coerced assimilation into dominant U.S. cultures that erase deeply meaningful differences in ways of knowing and being. Documenting and sharing the personal experiences, cultural legacies, politicization, and pedagogical approaches of queer-decolonial educators may begin to provide a powerful foundation for addressing the isolation, alienation, mentor-less-ness, unhealed intergenerational trauma, and needs for meaningful community engagement that many queer and trans youth, adults, elders, students, and educators experience. Without culturally relevant learning approaches and materials to attend to this task, pedagogies will continue to rely upon colonial, clinical, white, U.S. settler, and middle-class frameworks of selfhood. Such monocultural domination of our understandings of gender and sexual difference will only perpetuate disconnect within and across identities, experiences, and generations.  Theoretical Framework  This research draws upon queer political thought and pedagogy, and decolonial thought and pedagogy, to situate critiques of dominant systems of education, including the mainstream pedagogies of gender and sexual difference upon which our most visible forms of queer and trans advocacy are based. Queer and decolonial critique are not brought into conversation with one another often enough, as they have much to contribute to drawing out questions of dominance within the context of the Euro-American West, with specific regard to the roles colonialism, racialization/racism, xenophobia, queerphobia, and transphobia have played in the production of nations and their citizen-subjects (Morgensen, 2011). As public schooling has been identified as a major disciplinary institution of nation-states – while also being hailed as the gate through   7 which each person much pass to attain access to legitimacy and recognizability – this research will also explore thought and pedagogy in informal educational environments.  Queer Political Thought and Pedagogy  Alongside critical perspectives in education, which problematize the assumptions of state-based public schooling as beneficent, queer political thought poses challenging questions about queer-as-politics vs queer-as-identity alone, as well as the historical contingency of our very notions of gender and sexual difference, and how differences of all kinds have been framed as anti-statist (Canaday, 2011; Foucault, 1975, 1978; Lipman, 2011). This terrain of queer thought is most generative of intersectional critiques when it is refracted through analyses of place, race, class, and gender, particularly in the work of queer-of-color scholars who compel us to reflect on the simultaneous co-formations (Bacchetta, 2013; Stoler, 1995) of various identity categories. Because critical queer thought and pedagogy refuse facile categorizations, noting the specificity of emergent identities in particular contexts, forms of disidentification (Muñoz, 1999) proliferate in critical queer-of-color politics and pedagogy, wherein educators and learners loosen their grip on clear representations, and instead, focus on developing specific forms of resistance that exist in intimate relation to the acute and interlocking forms of domination present in a particular space of learning.   Scholars focused on schooling and pedagogy (Brockenbrough, 2012; Quinn & Meiners, 2016) insist on the value of seeing the identities, experiences, and legacies of educators as important pedagogical devices that make learning more relevant. Personal, political, and pedagogical commitments are present in every space of learning; it is valuable when queer and trans educators are able to point directly to these realities, a   8 practice that is often discouraged, as both educators and students are often compelled to dehumanize themselves as they work to fit into preestablished roles of adult/child, teacher/student, knowing/not-knowing (Lesko, 2012). Overlaying queer political perspectives with decolonial thought and pedagogy allows us to interrogate the very foundations of Western ways-of-knowing that lean heavily upon narratives that reinforce linear development, oppositional binary thinking, competitive hierarchies, and reductive or mechanistic analyses of people, cultures, and environments (Anzaldúa & Keating, 2015; Deloria & Wildcat, 1991) Decolonial Thought and Pedagogy  Decolonial thought and pedagogy is a necessary companion to queer political thought because queer political thought, in its most proliferated figurations, refuses the responsibility of thinking coloniality and racialization alongside questions of gender and sexual difference (Dwyer, 2015; Enke, 2016). Decolonial praxis is present in multiple notional and cultural spaces, including Human Rights Education, Global South pedagogies, and Indigenous pedagogies. While this research brings HRE, Global South, and Indigenous scholar-educators together, it is important to note the institutional power dynamics that position these contributions differently, particularly the work of Indigenous scholar-educators who have long been ignored, denigrated, assimilated, or tokenized within Euro-American academic spaces.  This work seeks solidarity with scholars and communities who continue to advocate against appropriation of lands, cultures, spiritual practices, and epistemologies (Freire, 2005; Grande, 2000; Tuck & Yang, 2017), particularly amidst trends in queer and trans studies that draw upon Indigenous gender and sexual diversity in order to legitimate   9 transhistorical and universal images of Euro-American gender- and sexuality-based identities (Wilson & Laing, 2018). This research brings these realms of thought in conversation not to collapse the one into the other, but to explore possibilities for resonance and to maintain incommensurable tensions that warrant further scholarship and theorization. In bringing queer and decolonial thought and pedagogies together, this research will seek a preliminary articulation across resonance-dissonance of possibilities for a queer-decolonial pedagogy that attends to the colonial, clinical, racialized, gendered, and sexualized legacies that produce education for the incorporation of citizens to the U.S. nation-state.  Purpose of the Study The purpose of this study is to explore and document the connections between personal experience and cultural legacy, politicization, and pedagogy for queer-decolonial educators who work toward possibilities for solidarity and healing across culture, generation, gender, sexuality, class, immigration history, indigeneity, place/region, formal education levels, and more. Because many of the mainstream pedagogical tools for teaching gender and sexual difference are both alienating and depoliticizing for many who are not from settler U.S.-born, white, and middle-class communities, these queer-decolonial educators often work across multiple cultural contexts, disciplines, and languages to explore opportunities to uproot queerphobia and transphobia, and build solidarity within and across difference. Queer-decolonial educators develop approaches to pedagogy that invite people to explore histories and realities that might begin to heal the intersections of queerphobia, xenophobia, racism,   10 and other forms of violence that emanate from colonial legacies of monocultural domination. Research Questions 1. For queer-decolonial educators, how have life experiences and cultural legacies influenced their politics of resistance and solidarity? 2. For queer-decolonial educators, how have resistance and solidarity politics informed approaches to pedagogy in formal and informal learning contexts? 3. How do queer-decolonial educators describe the importance of addressing queerphobia, transphobia, and decoloniality simultaneously? Significance of the Study  This study is significant insofar as there currently does not exist an explicit elaboration of a queer-decolonial pedagogy, particularly one that lends itself to thinking the linkages between theory, approaches to learning, curriculum, and reflections on process. Increasingly, there have been community-driven calls for these elaborations and materials to exist for spaces of formal and informal education. While there is prolific scholarship in the subfields of both queer and decolonial pedagogies, there is scant theoretical scholarship available that speaks to the intersections; however, it must be noted that queer and trans scholars who are people of color, immigrants, working class, and Indigenous often contribute to creating opportunities at the intersections of queerness, transness, racism, xenophobia, indigeneity, and colonialism (Bacchetta, 2016; Haritaworn, Kuntsman, & Posocco, 2014; Wilson & Laing, 2018). Such work has inspired the present research study, and this study aspires to be a meaningful contribution   11 to expanding the presence of queer-decolonial pedagogies in fields of Human Rights Education, queer education, decolonial education, and more.  The Road to Research  To situate this research, it is important to be transparent with regard to my positionality. I have not come to this topic as a distant observer, but have come to it through personal, political, and pedagogical commitments of my own. I am a person of mixed-descent, with ancestry largely in Europe and the Indigenous Americas. My family legacy is one of settler colonialism, assimilation into dominant racial and classed cultures, and the violence that comes with that. I have come to understand that as a mixed Chicanx person, there is both a loss of Indigenous lifeways as well as survival and privilege through intergenerational assimilation into settler cultural norms in what is now the United States.   Stories, on both sides of my family, are evocative of the broader histories of California. On my father’s side, the emergent military industrial complex of Southern California in the 1950s provided jobs that ensured access to middle class suburban utopia for people originally drawn to California seeking Hollywood fame. On my mother’s side, threats of deportation to Mexico, medical imprisonment, eugenic sterilization, poverty, and pride coalesce into complex intergenerational stories – and even more complex silences – particularly around immigrant, working-class, and Indigenous legacies that have been all but erased.   My legacy in education, particularly as a queer and trans educator of color, has been formative and fraught. I began working with students in working-class and immigrant communities soon after turning eighteen and entering college, and have   12 worked with people who have fewer material privileges than I do, but who also have an immense wealth of community, culture, and spirit. I have learned so much from working mostly in Chicanx/Mexican/Latinx immigrant communities over the years, and have also learned from Black communities, Pacific Islander communities, Southeast Asian immigrants, European immigrants, and more. Time and time again, I have been shown just how U.S. American I am – often in harmful ways – and have been gifted with opportunities to learn how to be otherwise. Practiced humility, seeking the lesson in every person and interaction, and endless curiosity are reservoirs I draw upon to feed my sense of what informal, and formal, education ought to be.   I have worked primarily in informal educational contexts for the past sixteen years and have had incredible opportunities to develop my own teaching tools, beginning at age eighteen when I was working with elementary school students on math and literacy skills in a Spanish-speaking community. Because I began my education work focusing on these kinds of skills, I learned the importance of prioritizing learner needs, rather than my own, particularly as I was a hugely privileged member of the school community as an undergraduate student at the elite private university nearby. This initial experience shaped how I later approached teaching about gender and sexual difference, first with peers and students, and later, intergenerationally with older adults. When I’m educating – even when doing so about issues that deeply impact my life – the learners and their lives come first. This is the role of the host-guest that I will elaborate later: entering someone else’s world in order to learn how to teach, often across difference.   I have studied many of the historical and political issues that shape how and why different communities are homophobic or transphobic. The literature review for this   13 research will illuminate many of these highly contextual and historically-specific dynamics. Even across California, the cultural, political, and religious landscape is so variegated that it’s impossible to position California as the unequivocal leader in queer and trans advocacy. I come from the Central Valley of California and have intimate knowledge of the way fundamentalist Christian religiosity shapes possibilities for life when, especially when it is not heterosexual or binary gendered. I have also worked alongside religious and spiritual communities to explore these issues. Queer-decolonial pedagogy does not give the pedagogue permission to be reactive – we are tenacious and voracious learners, often exposing ourselves to threat or risk of serious harm. I have not been granted the assumption that spaces of education will be safe, both as a learner and as an educator; transformation requires risk, and it also involves potential loss of safety or freedom. Solidarity often means that those of us with certain privileges must use that privilege not as a source or guilt or shame, but as a strategic leverage point for enacting much-needed social and institutional change.   From these understandings, I have worked with youth and adults from people of color, immigrant, and Spanish-speaking communities to explore meaningful and relevant pedagogies for teaching gender and sexual difference. The materials that have evolved from these processes are dynamic, fluid, and responsive to the places and peoples I’m working with. Such a process requires immersion, and re-immersion, always staying open to the unfamiliar and new, particularly as young people’s understandings of gender and sexual difference are already so very different from my own as a millennial queer and trans person of mixed-descent. Intergenerational humility is something I work towards, both as a younger person working with elders, as well as an adult working with youth.   14 This creative curricular space of navigating differences across age, educational experience, gender, sexuality, race, culture, and language has been nothing short of transformative and inspiring.   The title of this dissertation, “Remaking Friendship in Unlikely Places: Queer-Decolonial Educators and Connections Across Experience, Politics, and Pedagogy” warrants a moment of explanation. The verb “remake” is prolific in Indigenous feminist thought and scholarship (Grande, 2015; Risling-Baldy, 2018; Smith & Tuck, 2018), and is an intentional act of reckoning with attempted genocide at the military, social, spiritual, legal, linguistic, documentary, and genetic levels. This reckoning includes drawing upon and challenging colonial archives, listening to elder and intergenerational knowledge, recalling and listening through prayer and ceremony, and adapting creatively in order to revive practices that are not dead, but that have gone dormant (Risling-Baldy, 2018).  I accentuate the term friendship in a Foucauldian and Derridian sense of political friendship, wherein the affective, spiritual, disciplinary, pedagogical, and legal dimensions of in/hospitality necessitate genealogical excavation (Derrida, 2005; Foucault, 1997). Such excavations lend a kaleidoscope perspective on precisely why we have arrived at each moment of relational potential, and how we have arrived at those potentials in the places where we find ourselves. Attempts at monocultural domination of life and lands are the result of military Christian colonial rule over differences uncontainable, and mutualities irrepressible. A good friend once reminded me that we were never supposed to be friends, because of the ways our identities have been framed as oppositional, competitive, and wholly Other. This dissertation, and the legacies of thought it draws upon, is queer insofar as it refuses to be told who can be friends, who   15 can think together, and who can build kinship networks through which history might be held to account, and remade in the interests of those who believe that experience on the margins is truth enough.                        16 PART II: LITERATURE REVIEW In an effort to situate this study in an interdisciplinary theoretical and political terrain, the literature review will begin and end with focuses on education and pedagogy, while traversing gender and queer studies, post/decolonial thought, critical anthropology, and cultural studies. The current tools and curricula available for teaching gender and sexual difference have been produced predominantly by white, U.S.-born settler-descended, English-speaking, middle class, graduate school-educated professionals and clinicians. Because of this, translating these tools across different cultural contexts, and ways of being and knowing, is often met with frustration, suspicion, and confusion by those who are immersed in immigrant, people of color, poor, and Indigenous communities, and for understandable and legitimate reasons.  As a queer-decolonial educator who works across a multitude of contexts – including classrooms, youth programs, with elders, in community and professional trainings, and among peers – I am often confronted with a number of recurring tropes that ignore layers of difference within and across peoples. Some of these tropes include: gender/sexuality is a social construct (dismissing genders-in-diaspora or genders as forms of cultural survival); queer/trans is a white thing (invisibilizing queer and trans people who are people of color or Indigenous); and brown/black/poor/immigrant people are more homophobic and transphobic than white/middle class people (disregarding the different ways gender and sexual difference is lived and understood across culture, race, place, and class). Whether or not these tropes are articulated directly, they saturate understandings of gender and sexual difference, as well as resistance to the impacts of normative understandings that rely on binaries of man/woman, straight/queer,   17 out/closeted, and more; to date, few have developed analyses or tools to understand and intervene on these foreclosures in recognition and solidarity.  Furthermore, because I work to build support across differences in educational and social settings, these refrains trouble me because I have witnessed the ways they perpetuate racialized, classed, gendered, and sexualized senses of foreignness, and cruelty or ignorance towards people and groups who are portrayed as different, absent, or unwelcome. This literature review is an extension of a desire to understand how historical, political, and social forces shape the possibility of such utterances, as well as how they both bring people together and thrust them apart, particularly in learning contexts. I work professionally as a gendered and sexual violence prevention educator at a nonprofit staffed by people who are largely middle class and college-educated, and we work in partnership with communities who are predominantly working class, people of color, and immigrants, often without post-secondary education, though not without vast cultural learning, informal education, and life experience.  Drawing upon academic, professional, and community learning experiences, this research seeks to foster commitments to the generativity of queer, racial, generational, class, and cultural differences, when such differences are held in respectful tension. These differences and tensions can be embodied in pedagogy and curricula, both through decolonial relationships to education and learning, and through queering boundaries of age, language, authority, cultural knowledge, and more. I have been fortunate to have these pedagogical adventures supported by a small group of fellow queer-decolonial educators, whose voices, insights, and strategies will be foregrounded in this research. The act of naming place, legacy, and relationality is important in both decolonial and   18 queer approaches to pedagogy, and this literature review will be an effort to emplace, remember, and connect seemingly disparate realities and fields of thought and action.  In the literature review that follows, I bring together scholars who may or may not always self-identify as queer, and yet I find something queer/ed (as verb, rather than identity) in their approach to thinking the under-thought; furthermore, I bring together scholars who may or may not directly name the violence of coloniality or colonization, but whose critiques are relevant and useful for the work of decolonization, which is a complex, multivalent engagement that will be explored more fully below. Such scholarship is brought together not to displace the voices of those most impacted by queerphobia, transphobia, racism, and colonization, but to demonstrate the potentials for finding intellectual friendship in what might be described as unlikely places.  The work of queer-decolonial pedagogy requires serious risk-taking in challenging the bounds of topic, discipline, time, place, representation, and interpretation; when directly relevant literature is scant, reinterpretation may be the last vestige of agency in constructing an archive to speak to struggles and to a history of the present (Foucault, 1980; Knauft, 1996; Said, 1979). Taking such risks is possible through challenging moral hierarchy, the production of victim-subjects, and Western/Euro-American academic practice in its broadest sense. Risk-taking is rewarded through political friendship, collaboration-in-tension, and consistently refusing clean lines of Self/Other through which we all become freer to dream and be otherwise (Chatterji & Shapiro, 2011). Readers may perhaps encounter frustration, an exponential relationship to questions aroused here, excitement with encountering a different approach to entrenched struggle, or they may feel very little or nothing at all. Encountering difference ethically   19 requires that we develop new affective pathways through which we allow ourselves to change, and so we may allow others to simply be.  Politics of Difference: Queer and Decolonial Thought  Although this study focuses on pedagogy in both formal and informal settings, it is important to situate precisely why this project is approached in such a way. Fifteen years of work experience alongside public schools across four of California’s largest cities (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, and Fresno) positions me to understand the possibilities and foreclosures in different regions. These possibilities are often shaped by surrounding politics, land, and cultures of those very regions. From this, I have chosen to work primarily outside of public-school curricular requirements, which has afforded me a certain freedom around content that is not usually granted to public school educators. To illustrate the realities that shape formal education possibilities in California – and elsewhere – I turn to queer, decolonial, and critical education studies that can illuminate necessary questions to engage if we are to better understand where and how to advocate for queer-decolonial pedagogies and educator training. The educators interviewed for this research illuminated these themes as well. While public schools may not (yet) be amenable to the pedagogical interventions elaborated in this research – many of which trouble the very foundation of the public schooling itself – perhaps there may be something supportive for public school educators in simply naming the history and context of the many constraints under which they labor. This literature review begins with an elaboration of critical perspectives on education, largely drawing upon the fields of cultural studies, critical education studies, and social and cultural anthropology, before moving into a more focused discussion of queer and   20 decolonial perspectives on politics, culture, and education. In the Findings and Discussion chapter, we will see how queer-decolonial educators navigate curricular possibilities across diverse educational contexts.  Critical Perspectives on Education Neoliberal culture has increasingly shaped possibilities for public education in the U.S., as schools are required to duplicate the logic of capital, foregrounding notions of free choice for deracinated subjects, cost-benefit analyses, quantitatively measurable outcomes, market profitability, and a libertarian free-market blind faith in competition as the final arbiter of education quality (Giroux, 1989; Hofstadter, 1963; Lipman, 2011). We have entered a particularly concerning political era of educational governance, as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, under the Trump presidential administration, brazenly champions corporate charter schools, public military education, and firearms for educators, three responses to the current crises in public education that are without merit due to a lack of demonstrable improvement to education, safety, and sociality (Emma, Wermund, & Hefling, 2016; Singer, 2016).  Under neoliberalism – an overarching term used to describe the economic, cultural, and ideological subsuming of all sectors of public life under the logic of aggressive competition, endless exploitation of natural resources, and oligarchic capitalism (Brown, 2015) – schools have intensified their relationship to disciplinary governance. While cultural assimilation, social discipline, and moral impositions have been a part of free, public school systems for well over a hundred years (Hofstadter, 1963), the current iterations dangerously approximate other disciplinary institutions, such as factories, prisons, and laboratories. All three of these settings (in addition to schools   21 themselves) have been sites of immense violence for queer people, immigrants, poor people, Indigenous Peoples, and others (Blount, 2007; Deloria & Wildcat, 1991; Foucault, 1975; Repo, 2016). For a long time, there has existed an intimate relationship between obedience to authority and a sense of an individual’s ‘usefulness’ in capitalist economies and sites of knowledge production in the Western Euro-American world, according to Michel Foucault, in his seminal work Discipline and Punish (1975).  Foucault (1975), warning us to be wary of individualizing social apparatuses, reminds us that “by assigning individual places […] it made the educational space function like a learning machine, but also as a machine for supervising, hierarchizing, rewarding,” (p.147). Panopticism, or the internalization of a disciplinary ‘gaze’, demonstrates linkages between processes of othering within xenophobic contexts and procedures of social exclusion. This is noteworthy because these processes illuminate forms of productive power that Foucault (1978) distinguishes from negative power, or the power of repression, obstruction, and refusal. Productive power is understood to be demonstrated through relationships that produce realities, identities, ways of knowing, and forms of disciplinary practice that create a fictional belief in the capacity to accurately order and fully understand human diversity (Foucault, 1978), in the interest of domination. We need to understand disciplinary institutions, such as schools, not as failed institutions that do not properly educate, but rather, we need to look at them for what they effectively accomplish. One important accomplishment of the disciplinary institution of the school, according to Foucault, is the production of class interests and so-called delinquents (or Others).    22 Along a similar legacy of critique, Ian Hunter (1994) recognizes that many serious debates about the merits of public education often rely on discussions that take for granted the assumption that schooling inevitably transmits or realizes “certain underlying principles […] – democracy, equality, rationality, liberty […] but they all cohere around the notion of an ideal formation of the person,” (Hunter, 1994, p.7). Instead, Hunter argues that we should not take these underlying principles as our point of departure, or misbelieve that schools are manifestations of a constant, underlying logic; instead, we should see that schools are improvisational, aleatory, and are molded by shifts in history and the imperatives of each present moment refracted through the language of ostensible principles (Hunter, 1994). In Rethinking the School, Hunter demonstrates that schools are an improvised technology for living and draws out their origins in Christian hierarchical authority, a subject of critique for Foucault as well (Shapiro, 2004).  For decades, the United States has maintained a false faith in the efficacy of popular education (Hofstadter, 1963). In Anti-Intellectualism in American Life, educational historian Richard Hofstadter emphasizes the past connections between U.S. schools and the teaching of Christian morality, which has been explicit in some moments and implicit in others. Prescient in his analysis, Hofstadter points to dynamics that public-school educators and critics continue to grapple with today. He also gestures toward the legacy of U.S. schools as institutions of assimilation for immigrants and Indigenous peoples, where youth were activated as nodes of cultural transmission of American norms-in-the-making during times of consolidating a U.S. American identity, focusing on the socialization of healthy, clean, productive, disciplined, Christian citizen-subjects.    23 Hofstadter similarly critiques a reliance on the discipline of developmental psychology – a shift that occurred simultaneous to the professionalization of teacher education programs in colleges and universities – to develop appropriate educational approaches, as notions of childhood and adolescence are often culturally particular, and carry classed, racialized, and gendered implications of normativity as well (Burman, 2016; Murray, 2014). “The belief in mass education was not founded primarily upon a passion for the development of mind, or upon pride in learning and culture for their own sakes, but rather upon the supposed political and economic benefits of education,” (Hofstadter, 1963, p. 305). It is noteworthy that the U.S. education system has undergone gendered shifts in its teaching corps and has historically had one of the most “feminized” teaching bodies in the Euro-American sphere (Hofstadter, 1963, p. 320), a factor that has been credited with lending to its lack of prestige and livable wages. By the late 1980’s, critical education scholars and practitioners on the political Left had dropped the assumption that public education would inevitably inculcate democratic principles into students, an argument that still relies on Western notions of democratic participation as the telos of sociality, rather than attuning oneself to the necessary interconnections between humans and non-human (plant and animal) life, and learning to live in intimate relation with lands, ancestral legacies, and diverse cultures (Deloria & Wildcat, 1991). Critical education and materialist scholars have asked challenging questions about how schools “reproduce the logic of capital through the ideological and material forms of privilege and domination that structure the lives of students from various class, gender, racial, and ethnic groups,” (Giroux, 1989, p. 128). Giroux prolifically insisted that schools become sites of “political intervention” rather   24 than wholly dismissed as failed monoliths of corruption and domination. His work urged the training of teachers as transformative intellectuals and saw teachers’ roles as the most crucial determinants in shaping democratic practices for public life (Giroux, 1989).   Giroux (1989) also saw the need for educators to “develop a deconstructive practice that uncovers rather than suppresses the complex histories, interests, and experiences that make up the diverse voices that construct student subject positions,” (p. 147).  Evident in these theorizations is an immense concern with “linking the issue of educational reform to the broader considerations of democracy,” (Giroux, 1989, p. xi).  and avoiding the reduction of education to simply vocationalism. Education ought not be primarily about the private maximization of individual capacity and potential, but must be about public participation in political, democratic life, and – as will be delineated more fully below – about a connection to land/place, ancestors, legacy, and vibrant social, ethical, and spiritual life. Here, we see the crucial role educators play in shaping the possibilities for cultural and ecological survival, intergenerational learning, and sociality across difference. Giroux insists that rather than reproducing the logic of neoliberal capitalism, schools must critique master narratives by engaging with the self-understandings of subjugated peoples (such as women, queers, youth and elders, people of color, immigrants, and Indigenous peoples) as a mode of critical intervention on dominant knowledge production (Giroux, 1989). Mark Olssen and others have more recently emphasized the importance of addressing a world shaped by dynamics of globalization (and by necessity and extension, the importance of addressing colonization as well), in specific reference to how they shape educational practices and, more broadly, in regards to the global realities that   25 students must be prepared to navigate as they pursue an education (Olssen, Codd, & O’Neill, 2004). Olssen and his contemporaries reject idealistic and romanticized concepts of education, noting that under regimes of economic and social neoliberalism, “the state seeks to create an individual that is an enterprising and competitive entrepreneur,” (Olssen, et al., 2004, p. 136). These scholars, and others, understand neoliberal rationality to be a threat not only to public education, but to democratic institutions and diverse cultural practices themselves (Olssen, 2006; Olssen, et al., 2004; Brown, 2015).  Narratives of choice and competition do not account for the social, political, and economic limitations that structure choice and the capacity to compete, let alone a desire to approach life through a framework of competition rather than cooperative interdependence and relationality. In the context of the interviews conducted for this research, queer-decolonial educators spoke repeatedly about the constraints of neoliberal capitalism, sometimes directly naming this socio-economic system, and other times alluding to it by illustrating its disastrous effects in families, peer groups, and schools.  Queer and Decolonial Perspectives on Education Reminding us of the colonial legacy of education – especially important to remember as California, the location of this research, is a colony that has changed hands between Spain, Mexico, and the United States over the past 200-250 years – South Asian feminist scholar and social critic Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (2004) propounds that “colonialism was committed to the education of a certain class,” (p. 524). Spivak (2004) diagnoses that “the problem with U.S. education is that it teaches (corporatist) benevolence while trivializing the teaching of the Humanities,” (p. 532), and that the true challenge the educator faces is to “learn to learn from below” (p. 548). This implies that   26 one must have in-depth knowledge of students not for their discipline and management, but to provide an aesthetic education that involves the consensual reframing of our wills to knowledge and action (Spivak, 2004) through critical engagements with history, social thought, the arts, and more, so that students may grow to question the neoliberal desires that have been coercively taught to them through a dominant education system that trains more than it teaches.  Like many others, Spivak emphasizes the importance of engaging local communities – including displaced, poor, rural, and Indigenous peoples – in conflict resolution and developing particular and relevant understandings of democratic participation in public life across different senses of ethics, politics, decision-making, and hierarchical authority (Spivak, 2004). Similar to Paolo Freire (1970) in Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Spivak also warns against “subalternist essentialism” because “during the initial stages of the struggle, the oppressed […] tend themselves to become oppressors,” (Spivak, 2004, p. 542), demonstrating the importance of not romanticizing subalternity, but seeking practices of sociality and democratic participation rather than revenge, retribution, or punishment of particular groups. Within this context, it is crucial to remember that what is viewed as queer and Other have been produced through academic knowledge, as well as through colonial practices in public schools. This has occurred particularly through curriculum policing, but just as importantly through the shaping of educators as public figures who have been tasked with the responsibility of training students who are properly gendered, de/sexualized, raced, and classed. In the context of the colonial United States, schools and teachers have become tools of cultural assimilation and genocide in ways that have   27 shaped life possibilities for queers, Indigenous peoples, immigrants, and poor people for quite some time. In later sections, we will see how queer-decolonial educators find organic entry points for engaging these intersecting realities through innovative curricula and frames of analysis.  Jackie M. Blount, a scholar whose work focuses on the history of gender and sexual normalization in schools and teacher education, has noted that schools have perpetually reinforced norms of rigid binary gender through district hiring practices, standardized and gendered dress codes for students and teachers, curricular materials and training, school-wide social engagements (like dances), and sports teams and events (Blount, 2007). She notes that any efforts to loosen the grips of pedagogies that promote rigid binary gender and to strengthen ones that promote the needs of LGBTQ+ educators and students have been met with consistent conservative and fundamentalist Christian responses that complicate or prevent meaningful and urgently needed shifts in school policy and practice (Blount, 2007).  Blount’s work also names a marked transition post-World War II, which saw a noteworthy decrease in women’s leadership in public schools, impacting both their agency to shape schooling and their abilities to maintain social independence because of lower wages. Prior to WWII, schools held marriage bans against women teachers, but after WWII, these marriage bans were dropped because single women were portrayed as gender deviant, and gender deviance was increasingly used as a diagnostic predictor for sexual deviance. During this time, sexual deviance was coded as queer and pathological/criminal. Single women who were non-reproductive were also figured as participants in White race-suicide, linking rigid gender expectations and eugenic efforts   28 that put white women in the role of racial and gender pedagogues in both school and family life (Blount, 1996; Ordover, 2003).  School employment screenings for teachers included noting down so-called gender deviant traits, a practice that was adopted from military screenings for potential homosexuals (Blount, 2007), an institutionalized effort that primarily targeted gay or differently gendered men. After the release of the volume titled Sexual Behavior of the Human Male (also known as the Kinsey Report) in 1948, which assessed that roughly a third of all U.S. men who participated in the study had engaged in orgasm-inducing homosexual contact (Kinsey, 1998), the U.S. military began a massive campaign to exclude queer men from the military; this inquisition spread from the military to all public employment during the 1950s and 60s. The crafting of U.S. American national identity, military masculinity, normative heterosexual genders, nuclear families, and productive/consumptive household units within a rising neoliberal superpower was crucial to the production of the U.S. as the dominant imperial nation-state (Blount, 1996; Foucault, 2004).   Blount (1996) notes that the post-WWII Cold War years also saw a rise in multiple forms of xenophobia, first configured as the Red Scare, which soon transitioned into the Lavender Scare, as federal government ideologues decided it was strategically simpler to root out homosexuals rather than communists (1996). Nuclear family impositions had intensified during the 1950s and 1960s, and concerns about gender and sexuality in educational and familial life were prolific in the normalizing medical and psychoanalytic human sciences (Donzelot, 1997; Karkazis, 2008). Blount’s scholarship (2004a, 2004b) theorizes that schools controlled students and educators in at least three   29 ways: firstly, by identifying queers as a class or species to exclude, discipline, or punish (Foucault, 1978); secondly, by defining and regulating gender, with deviance from rigid binary norms used as an indicator of queerness or homosexuality; and thirdly, allowing school boards and school administrators to define normative gender and sexuality in teaching hiring, training, and disciplining.  Blount’s work also points to the links between developmental psychology, teacher’s roles, and the pathologizing of gender and sexual difference; she notes that prominent Christian psychologist George Alan Rekers was instrumental in advocating for the institutionalization of Gender Identity Disorder in the American Psychological Association’s DSM. Rekers believed that so-called deviant youth could be corrected through instruction by gender-normative adults, with a concerted focus on teachers and mothers as formative influencers (Blount, 2004a; Blount, 2004b). Christian patriarchy, Western human sciences, and the national/imperial aspirations of the U.S. as an emergent military superpower all conspired to create paranoia around gender and sexual difference in teachers, students, and citizens of the nation-state (Canaday, 2011). During the 1970s, the vast majority of the U.S. population – over 70% – believed that queer adults should not be teachers (Blount, 2004b).  Kahn and Gorski (2016) note that the image of the exemplar educator continues to be cisgender and heterosexual; they also note that public school teachers in the United States are held to higher standards of conformity to social norms than the average person. An important reality to consider is that as of the 2015-16 school year, white teachers were just over 80% of the public-school teaching corps and over 75% of all teachers were women (Taie, Goldring, & Spiegelman, 2018), groups that are often socialized to be   30 racial and gender gatekeepers within larger bureaucratic institutions and structures that benefit both White and Male Supremacy (Kumashiro, 2002). In thirty-six out of fifty states, an educator can still be fired for being queer or trans, and California is the only state with legal protection for educators who are interested in teaching LGBTQ content in history and social science classrooms (Romesburg, et al., 2014). Kahn and Gorski (2016) also note that 85% of teacher education programs across the U.S. have no curricular materials regarding queer and trans inclusion, and that 75% don’t have any kind of multicultural or equity course at all (p. 17).  Noting that schools are already both sexualized and gendered environments (in terms of youth exploring relationships, sex, and gendered ways of being, often while on campus) Darla Linville (2017) urges us to think about the violence inherent in preventing educators from engaging both gender and sexuality in more meaningful ways in classrooms. Her work reports that students have identified teachers as important adult resources for gaining knowledge about navigating the world; therefore, educators need both freedom, training, and resources to meaningfully address gender and sexuality in schools (Linville, 2017). Additionally, even if students are not self-identifying as queer or trans, queer bodies show up at schools, and teachers and students are required to navigate school settings that often expose them to multiple layers of harm. Ed Brockenbrough (2015), focusing particularly on queer students of color, notes that such students “face multiple obstacles to safe and full participation,” (p. 28), both demonstrating the need for advocacy work, yet without noting the colonial and normalizing context of what constitutes “full participation” – critical queer-decolonial pedagogies must consider precisely what we seek inclusion within.    31 Brockenbrough (2015) furthers his discussion by noting the distinction between additive and transformational approaches to education, insisting on the power within women of color feminisms to anchor a queer of color critique of education. He notes that the “politics of knowledge production” (p. 32) must be grounded in an analytic of race, gender, and sexuality simultaneously, noting that whiteness is too often privileged in queer studies. This research project is, in part, a response to Brockenbrough’s call for outlining processes of curricula development, nothing that including queers of color in these processes would lead to more than just additive contributions, but transformational ones. Brockenbrough (2012) also insists that possibilities for social visibility, described as “outness” (p. 37), are hugely mediated by race and gender, complicating narratives of queer representation that often portray visible (or recognizable) queerness through white frames of representation. Brockenbrough does note, though, that ambiguities of outness carry potentials that reject a binary of out/not-out, one that is racially and culturally particular; he notes that many black educators have emphasized the importance of connecting with black communities rather than queer ones, refusing the assumption of acceptance in queer worlds that are too often dominated by middle class and white cultural norms.  Concerted efforts to keep queer and non-white educators from students and classrooms have been challenged by critical scholars of color, including feminists, queer theorists, among others. Nancy Taber (2014) draws attention to the importance of intersectional potentials in women-of-color philosophies of pedagogy that foreground dynamics of gender, race, and class. Taber looks to bell hooks and how her work navigates the tensions and incommensurability of difference that emerge in classroom   32 settings, noting that types of oppression cannot be segregated. Isolating students from critical queer educators of color helps to perpetuate divide-and-conquer strategies of governance that prevent the teaching of solidarity politics that emanate from those who have lives shaped by multiple and imbricated forms of oppression.  Drawing intimately on life experience to inform approaches to politics – as well as approaches to social learning – has long been central to queer of color feminist praxis, particularly evident in the work of Gloria Anzaldúa (Anzaldúa, 2012; Sharma, 2014; Anzaldúa & Keating, 2015). Suniti Sharma (2014) emphasizes Anzaldúa’s radical vision that knowledge of life history is important in order to situate a scholar’s pedagogical and theoretical approaches to social, political, and spiritual transformation. Anzaldúa’s work foregrounds what she calls spiritual activism and autohistoria-teoría, which is a space of knowledge production that subverts Eurocentrism by displacing clear distinctions between public and private, Self and Other, and individual and collective. Autohistoria-teoría situates experience within history and theoretical thought, often moving through diverse forms of prose writing that are suffused with politics, poetic writing, and spirituality. Such work fractures the hard boundaries of rigid disciplinary practice (Anzaldúa & Keating, 2015). Sharma (2014) notes five crucial components of Anzaldúan scholarship that are essential for transforming consciousness, bringing us closer to the potentials for decolonial education: discussion as democratic practice, critique as inquiry, counter-narratives as knowledge production, critical self-reflection for change, and activism for social and political transformation.  McNeil, Wermers, and Lunn (2017) emphasize that just as queer is resistant and capable of challenging norms, it is important to place productions of queerness firmly   33 alongside thinking coloniality. In the context of thinking difference and coloniality in the United States, it would be a glaring – and violent – omission to exclude the critical scholarship of Indigenous thinkers and educators. Many contemporary critical and queer scholars – even those of color – often ignore the vast contributions of Indigenous scholars and communities, particularly in philosophies that powerfully interrupt the separation of ethics, teaching, learning, relationality to all beings, spirituality, and the absolute importance of place, or context. In their narrative auto-theorizing, queer-decolonial educators demonstrate the importance of linking place, context, teaching/learning, ethics, spirituality, and political dissent.  In Power and Place: Indian Education in America, Vine Deloria, Jr. and Daniel R. Wildcat (1991) insist that school curricula, across all levels of education, “bear the largest imprint of Western metaphysics” (p. 10) in the ways we divide disciplines and subjects.  Their work emphasizes a need to increasingly think about learning as “not a result of explicit pedagogy or teaching” but something achieved through “living” (p. 13). Deloria and Wildcat critique the violent orthodoxies of a dogmatic Western (and Christian) education system that atomizes academic subjects and living beings from one another, and that obfuscates the reality that “all relationships have a moral content,” (p. 23). Because of this ethical imperative, Indigenous knowledge about the world has never been distinct from sacred or spiritual ways of knowing, and Indigenous peoples have long been concerned with the impacts of their actions on other living beings, including lands, plants, animals, and other non-human entities (Deloria & Wildcat, 1991).  Consonant with Western critiques of education under neoliberalism, Deloria and Wildcat (1991) note that contemporary U.S. education “is a major domestic industry” that   34 “may well become the industry of the American future,” (p.41). Within this context, it is essential that decolonial – and queer – thought and pedagogies understand the importance of deconstructing the economic, imperial, and militaristic drives of the nation-state. Indigenous scholars are well-situated to speak to the violence inherent in rigid Western and Christian educational prerogatives that have long served the colonial and military interests of genocide and dehumanization for non-white and non-Christian peoples (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2015; Madley, 2016).  Drawing on experience, as situated in an Indigenous metaphysics that centers relationality rather than alienation, Deloria and Wildcat (1991) insist that education in the U.S. context “resembles indoctrination...because it insists on implanting a particular body of knowledge...which often does not correspond to the life experiences that people have or might be expected to encounter,” (p. 42). In their estimation, education abstracted from real life is both evidence of the violence of alienation from land, spirit, ancestors, and relatives, as well as alienation from one’s own personal experiences and sense of reality. These observations are echoed in the scholarship of Scott Lauria Morgensen (2012) when he notes that “normative knowledge production” is “not only non-Indigenous but colonial” and carries political, racial, and cultural implications (p. 805). Writing on “An Ecology of Indigenous Education,” Gregory Cajete (1994) illustrates the immense creativity in processes of learning that attend to the needs of life. As a renowned pedagogue, Cajete emphasizes the naturalness of human capacities to learn, create, adapt, and flourish in social life, particularly when education is grounded, quite literally, on land. He compels us to consider that “American education must move from a focus on specialization to holistic knowledge; from a focus on structures to   35 understanding processes...” (p. 27), including processes that involve connections not just to knowledge production in schools and academia, but connections to social and spiritual worlds as well. Indigenous education emphasizes fostering the uniqueness and interconnection of all living beings. Such support for uniqueness, or difference, bears acute relevance to questions of gender and sexual difference, as embodied and lived by queer and trans educators and learners.  Linda Tuhiwai Smith (2005) emphasizes as well that “Indigenous epistemologies lead to new kinds of educational experiences and outcomes” (p. 93) that bear relevance to more than just curricula and pedagogy, but to understandings of difference more broadly, particularly within movements for decolonizing land, culture, epistemology, and pedagogy. She insists that schools are only one context where learning happens, and that formal education can’t be the only site where critical scholars are looking to expand possibilities for dynamic and meaningful educational and research opportunities. This analysis is a call-to-action to which this research project is a response. Smith’s work sits alongside others, including Eve Tuck (2009a, 2009b), who notes that storytelling and social practices of knowledge production and transmission often include more perspectives from diverse genders and age groups, making space for the voices of women, queers, Two-Spirits, youth, and most importantly, elders.  Bringing together the frameworks of critique that come from critical education scholars, queer scholars, and decolonial and Indigenous scholars allows us to begin imagining the ways that processes of othering are deeply embedded social practices that position women, trans, queer, Indigenous, immigrant, poor, rural, and other communities as marginal to knowledge production. When those marginalized are not meaningful   36 participants in these practices of knowledge production, queerphobia and xenophobia become infused in social and classroom pedagogies, as cultural norms are learned and taught without consideration for those whose ways of knowing and being run against normative and assimilationist patterns. The queer-decolonial educators I spoke with provide powerful examples for what is possible within education when complex voices and experiences shape learning experiences. Before engaging pedagogies of difference more fully, it will first be illustrative to explore the imbrications of queerphobia and xenophobia as a means for situating the inextricability of colonial discourses of otherness in their overlaid and intertwined manifestations in education and social life.  Learning Queerphobia Alongside Xenophobia To understand the need for developing pedagogies that attend to intersections of history and experience, educators work to acknowledge that age, race, gender, sexuality, indigeneity/settler-hood, and nationality emerge as co-productions. Queer-of-color feminist scholar Paola Bacchetta (2016) uses the term co-formations to describe these phenomena, whereby processes of subjectification (Foucault, 2015) – or, said plainly, processes of becoming a self or subject – rely heavily on imbricated categories and understandings of multiple social and ideological positions. Within these co-formations, we see that what is viewed as queer is also often viewed as Other (xenophobic queerphobia) and that what is seen as Other is often viewed as queer (queerphobic xenophobia) (Bacchetta, 1999). When discussing what is Other in terms of race, we are also speaking of what is Other to the nation-state, illuminating the historical and present-day links between genocide, repatriation, refugee prisons, racism, queerphobia, and nationalism (Puar, 2007).    37  Bacchetta’s (2013) work on Hindu majoritarianism demonstrates that dominant Right-wing tropes of Muslims in India mirror many of the tropes of Mexicans in U.S. political discourse, including that they are criminals and rapists. These parallels demonstrate the mobility of racialized narratives of difference that position specific groups outside the status of proper citizen. Bacchetta (2013) additionally notes the gendering of this proper citizen, illuminating that “the citizen-body is a male hom(m)osocial entity […] to the exclusion of women,” (p.127), and by analytic extension, queers, immigrants, refugees, and Indigenous Peoples. Historically, the United States has excluded both women and non-white groups from the right to vote, hold public office, own property, and more.   Queer people have been excluded from many citizenship rights, and have been actively criminalized and pathologized (along with women, Indigenous peoples, immigrants, descendants of enslaved Africans, poor people, and others) across many historical moments (Mogul, Ritchie, & Whitlock, 2011), particularly in moments of national crisis (Puar, 2007). In the U.S., we have witnessed the proliferation of the idea of queers as non- or anti-citizens (Canaday, 2011). Additionally, because of a concerted preoccupation with policing the boundaries of male citizenship, women and men have been subjected to often divergent forms of discipline and management because just as male citizens mattered the most, so too did male perverts when safeguarding the nation (Canaday, 2011). Homosexual men have been barred from military and government employment, denied federal benefits, received heightened screening for immigration, and have been periodically accused of “political subversion” (Canaday, 2011, p. 2).   38 Consonant with Bacchetta’s (2013) naming of xenophobic queerphobia, Canaday notes that homosexuals, under McCarthyism, were portrayed as traitors to the state.   Margot Canaday (2011) is careful to note that the category of the queer or homosexual is not a preexisting category that exists to be described; rather, she demonstrates how such categories are produced precisely through their regulation. She also notes that “the federal government […] never defined homosexual status in the abstract, but always as a part of defining citizenship” (p. 7). Because federal agencies took the lead in shaping definitions of citizenship, so too did those same federal agencies take the lead in defining homosexual identity. As these citizenship policies “crystalized homosexual identity,” consequently, “certain individuals began to think of their sexuality in political terms, as mediating, and mediated by their relationship to the state” (p. 10).   Somerville (2000) noted an historical moment of crisis between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century. During this time, it was a crucial part of the formation of the United States as a dominant military nation to distinguish not just between homosexual and heterosexual, but to also form rigid distinctions between black and white, further demonstrating the concomitant processes of reductive bifurcation that lent to the co-formations of race, sexuality, and gender. Somerville (2000) reminds us “that the physical body offers transparent evidence of its history, identity, and behavior is a deeply held cultural fiction in the United States,” (p. 9), naming the body as a text believed to be readily interpretable along binary lines of race, gender, sexuality, and citizen/non-citizen. Jasbir K. Puar (2007) punctuates this analysis by citing the United States’ uncertain relation to its queers, seeing them as assimilable or incorporable in some places and moments, yet wholly suspect and Other in different places and moments.    39  Furthermore, it is important to note that the borders of nation and citizenship are in flux, and that this analysis by Luibhéid and Cantú (2005), in Queer Migrations, can also be extrapolated to boundaries of race, gender, and sexuality. Luibhéid and Cantú (2005), speaking to processes of immigration and the narrow constructs of a heteronormative family structure, demonstrate that what is ‘queer’ about many immigrant families is filtered out through the immigration process, as appearing normatively gendered and sexualized through that process becomes an imperative for passing as a nationally incorporable subject. In Entry Denied, Luibhéid (2002) elaborates that sexual (and gender) regulation at the border exists in direct relation to the regulation of sexuality and gender within the United States, and that these relations are ever-shifting, defying dominant constructions of sexual, gender, and racial identities as ahistorical, knowable, stable, and linked to a core truth of individuals.  Within California history in particular, there have been countless examples of the immense interconnections between gender, sexual, racial, and immigration policing, related to reality of California as a multiply-situated border state. Early efforts included the attempted genocide of Indigenous Peoples and specifically, the gendercide of Indigenous Third Genders and Two-Spirit people and roles in the Spanish missions (Magana Mancillas & Bello, 2010, Miranda, 2010). Later, the Immoral Dress Codes of the late 1800s prohibited Chinese immigrants from wearing clothing that did not conform to American standards of binary gendered clothing (Sears, 2008; Sueyoshi, 2005). Following the development of federal immigration laws, California bore witness to the disruption of Mexican families, genders, and sexualities during the Bracero Program after WWII, as Mexicans were viewed as a demographic and social threat to white supremacy   40 (Bracero History Archive, 2011; Molina, 2006). More recently, the UCLA Gender Identity Research Clinic of the 1960s and 1970s used medical and psychological experimentation on white, suburban, intersex, queer, and otherwise gender diverse children in Southern California as an effort to infuse families and communities with binary gender paranoia (Germon, 2010; Reis, 2009; Repo, 2016).  Running through this history is the categorical imperative of bifurcation, of rendering neat and binary what is actually immeasurable and uncategorizable. The colonial and clinical regulation of bodies and borders through rigid binary understandings has both produced and ignored hybrid and complex subject positions that become repositories of suspicion and discipline (Asad, 1998; Prentice, 2013). Queer-decolonial pedagogies must attend to these histories, and the present realities that have been produced through them; it is a matter of necessity that these pedagogies address not just the topical manifestations of such epistemological shaping of reality, but the very foundations of those ways of knowing and being produced through Western colonial narratives of selfhood, nation, and human value. Clear distinctions between groups are often fictions of regulatory practice. The educators interviewed for this research speak to the importance of immersing oneself in history and legacy in order to demonstrate the constructed reality of borders that run through lands, generations, and bodies.  Hybridity: Race, Gender, Sexuality, Nation-State  Queer-decolonial pedagogies are valuable precisely because they dissolve clear lines – which are prolifically evident in Western imperatives to categorize and hierarchize along an axis of most-to-least-Human (Deloria, 1999).  Such lines are often used to demarcate differences of Self/Other, and forms of queer-decolonial pedagogy are   41 possible often because those enacting them are people of complex experience and cultural legacy. Before exploring queer and decolonial pedagogies, it is important to better situate how such hybridity of culture, experience, and identity has been portrayed, and how such portrayals have been critiqued by those whose are categorically uncontainable. This so-called excess is a generative gift for pedagogy and students, rather than being a danger to their social and cognitive wellbeing.  The theoretical and historical scholarship outlined in the previous section demonstrates that the boundaries between groupings and identities of race, gender, sexuality, and citizenship are contingent and continually reproduced, frequently in educational settings. The intersections of these categories of subjectivity necessarily produce complex, contested, and hybrid relationships to identities that are most frequently presented in binary forms: heterosexual/homosexual, black/white, man/woman, citizen/non-citizen, even urban/rural. For many queer educators and students, these divisions that shape daily reality fail to speak of and to their experiences. This study is based on the presumption that queer educators and students likely inhabit multiple and mobile identities and experiences.  Gloria Anzaldúa, in Borderlands/La Frontera (2012) presents readers with a marked refusal of exclusive binaries of race, language, citizenship, Indigenous/settler positionalities, gender, and sexuality. Her work theorizes the concept of mestiza consciousness as a third space that recognizes contingency, contradiction, and complexity as generative perspectives through which to engage alterity, both in oneself and in others. Anzaldúa refuses the oppositional binary of man/woman. Anzaldúa notes that because of differences in gender and sexuality, she is able to evoke a generative hybridity, one that is   42 not a romanticized site, but that is as painful and isolating as it is enlivening. Her work emphasizes that the borderlands are both figurative and literal, particularly for those who have lived in what is now the southwestern United States, locations that have been exchanged as colonies multiple times and whose residents have historically changed, or been denied, citizenship and access to lands in a new nation.  Alongside citizenship, language becomes a tool to evoke hybridity in Anzaldúa’s work, a complex space which feminist-of-color theorist Lisa Lowe (1996) has described as evidence of a history of survival. Lowe furthers her own discussion of hybridity by challenging the naming of immigrants through the framework of first/second/third generation. She argues that this as a reductive discursive move, because it takes complex dynamics of public, social difference and places it within the private realm of reproductive families, positioning immigrant realities as degrees removed from an originating site of cultural wholeness or purity. This analytic gesture masks the complex ways that families and communities navigate overlapping dynamics of cultural assimilation and cultural survival. These matters are complicated further when groups of people, like many who have lived in the U.S. southwest for generations, including Indigenous peoples, have stayed in place while the dominant cultures around them have changed.  Additionally, narratives of generational distance from cultural origins first emerged from colonial authorities who focused on phenotypic, linguistic, religious, culinary, and bodily/clothing assimilation as intentional practices of colonization and genocide (Morgensen, 2011; Niezen, 2000). This was accomplished through the pseudoscience of hypo- and hyperdescent within Indigenous bloodlines and cultures, as   43 well as through intermarriage and kidnapping, particularly children of mixed descent (Adams & DeLuzio, 2012). To hinge a sense of moral purity or cultural authenticity on non-assimilation is to take on a colonial gaze that separates individuals, families, and generations in efforts toward divide-and-conquer ideology and practice.  Categorizing and hierarchizing groups in order to evaluate who is most-human, most-authentic, or most-true is a firmly European epistemological practice of the dehumanizing human sciences (Foucault, 1989). The work of queer-decolonial pedagogy, which this research elaborates, is contoured by its specific location in the Bay Area of California. It is influenced as well by the diverse regions surrounding it, regions with which I am intimately familiar. In his book Intimate Frontiers, Albert Hurtado (1999) notes that “California was the sort of place [that exemplified] the drama of life on the edges where people and places meet,” (p. xxviii) as well as a place where “the collision of nations and the mixture of cultures […] have made the identification of racial, cultural, and national status of individuals a tricky business,” (p. xxi). Because of the many flows of various immigrant groups and the efforts to invisibilize Indigenous peoples, racial formation in California has served as fertile ground for the consolidation of other categories, including gender and sexuality, as discussed above. Given that all the educators interviewed for this research currently reside in the Bay Area of California, placing their work in regional context is of great value in refusing universal narratives of race, gender, and sexuality.  Audre Lorde reminds us of the original theorizations of the term homophobia, which she clarifies as the fear of homosexual desires in oneself that is then projected onto others who may elicit the fear of that possibility within ourselves (Lorde, 2007). This was   44 a fear that came to be purposefully tied to the impetus to populate a new state with desirable groups through European settler, heterosexual, reproductive monogamy, while forcibly sterilizing immigrants, Indigenous peoples, poor people, and people descended from enslaved Africans (Ordover, 2003). Resituating terms like homophobia and transphobia as results of purposeful fear-mongering within dominant groups, rather than being natural responses to othered groups, demonstrates the ways that constructions of difference are more about creating a coherent narrative of a dominant self, rather than describing diverse realities.   Connectedly, Siobhan Somerville (1994) reminds us that in the past, female bodies were used in experiments designed to learn more about the differences between white and non-white racial groups, as non-white racial groups were not assumed to be sexually dimorphic in the ways that people of European descent were. Alongside this is the European history that viewed hybridity as monstrous (Foucault, 2003), where what was described as pure and whole was seen as closer to God within Christian cultures (Shapiro, 2004). Michel Foucault (2003, 2015) draws discursive and material connections between the linked rhetoric of Satanic influence, Indigenous spirituality, monstrosity, hybridity, intersex people, abnormality, and criminality, links that we continue to see today through institutions that continue to pathologize (and Christianize) non-white queer bodies, genders, and sexualities that evade binary definitions.  Paul Gilroy (2000) notes that hybrid identities are seen as an affront to purity, and that urban centers are generally imagined as contact zones of difference; queer scholars of color, such as James Baldwin, have discussed the ways that these contact zones of difference are productive not just of identities of color, but of whiteness itself; white   45 people are not blank canvasses onto which gender and sexuality are grafted, but rather their racial formation intersects with other identities as it does for every racialized group, though these intersections are often made much less visible (Baldwin, 1995). Racial identities are co-constructed in relation to one another, making ‘pure’ racial identities inherently hybrid through blurred lines of Self and Other, produced by positing white more through what it is not, rather than what it is (Allen, 2012; Baldwin, 1995). These processes are mediated by concepts and realities of place, including urban and rural distinctions that belie the immense interconnections across seemingly distinct regions.   Homi Bhabha (1994) explores the right to difference, one that exists apart from originary and essentialized notions of the political subject. He finds these latter notions problematic because of their reliance on inherent essences of individuals or groups, narratives that are important to counter in a colonial or Euro-American context because of how they have been used to dehumanize those whose essences are deemed evil, non-Christian, or pathological. It is important to note that discussions of essence or truth in Indigenous cultures often bear very different meanings, as selfhood is not understood as fully individuated from other humans and non-human entities, including land, making them inherently natural in their diversity and interconnection.  Furthering this critique, Bhabha focuses on the multiple hybrid zones of Self/Other, private/public, Man/Nature, and refuses the clean borders that are often used to organize these zones of contact. His work also insists on the transgressive potentials of foreignness, mixedness, and impurity, because they force questions about closely-held categories. Bhabha urges us to reflect on the dual fear-desire of miscegenation, and contends that our representations and interpretations of ourselves and of others have   46 become a repository for fantastical stories. These stories are most often connected to a European legacy of romanticizing and exoticizing what is Other as a practice of producing a coherent subjectivity of Self (Bhabha, 1994; Said, 1979). Queer-decolonial pedagogies require inevitable confrontations with hybridity, as these spaces of learning point to the problematic ways difference is often represented and interpreted as wholly-Other.   What is to be done with these representations and interpretations? Rather than wholly reject them, queer scholars of color have insisted on developing relations to historical, discursive, and material domination that refuse to simply revalue a binary (Nietzsche, 1989). Instead, we engage with our problematic inheritances as practices of deconstruction, to discover what has been hidden and to make evident the deferral and projection of meaning (Derrida, 2016). José Esteban Muñoz (1999) is one such scholar who took on this imperative, describing disidentification as a relationship of thoughtful reflection – which may include refusals – to texts and worlds, offering critique from a place that accepts that what is European and non-European are now inextricably linked in our postcolonial realities (Said, 1979). It is important to note the vastly different cultural practices that have survived colonization in the Americas due to the legacies of Indigenous peoples’ and immigrant creativity and persistence in maintaining connections through ancestors, land, and land (Deloria, 1999). Muñoz’s work welcomes the complexity of the role of researcher, wherein one must use dominant modes in order to critique them, recognizing that identity is often fractured and that mixedness of legacy ought to be a starting assumption, rather than a startling discovery that only demonstrates our deep drive for purity.    47 Other queer, Latinx scholars have emphasized the so-called impurity of queer identities of color, instead illuminating the intersubjective, relational, and social dimensions of personhood (Martinez, 2011). Scholars and writers have highlighted the shared, or co-produced, reality of queerness, even sometimes through its very denial. There are clear links between what is heterosexual and what is queer, particularly as cultural definitions of gender and sexuality are in flux through multiple displacements of language, im/migration, and generational understandings (Martinez, 2011). Martinez goes as far as to describe queer identities in communities of color as “heterodiegetic,” meaning that a primary, first-person narrator is displaced and that our stories are often developed and told alongside those closest to us. He provides us with the example of the fictionalized autobiographical narratives in the collection Zigzagger, by Manuel Muñoz (2003), which features queer characters of color in rural California Central Valley towns. Both Martinez and Muñoz illustrate the immense labor in maintaining the separations between queerness and straightness, both becoming intimately linked to one another in ways not as explicitly or frequently explored in white queer scholarship. Linking Context to Pedagogy  Important as this historical, cultural, and epistemological context may be, what relevance does it bear to pedagogies that foreground queer and decolonial practices of difference? Because scholarship in the field of education often prioritizes either theory or pedagogy (even as theory is itself a form of pedagogy, and pedagogy is always infused with theoretical foundations, though often unspoken), it is essential to illuminate the rich and contested field of possibilities for both formal and informal learning around gender and sexual difference. Without looking to questions of political and pedagogical   48 possibility for these topics under the legacy of U.S. militaristic, racist, genocidal, neoliberal, xenophobic, and queerphobic cultures of education, efforts to craft queer-decolonial pedagogies may fall into the ideological disarray – and complicity with ongoing violence – that often accompanies historical amnesia. Ongoing and intersectional critique can lend itself to ever-shifting creativity as a response to the myriad forms of violence encountered in the process of developing queer-decolonial pedagogies.  Practices of Difference: Queer and Decolonial Pedagogies  As an educator, most of my time has been spent in contexts where gendered and sexualized violence and difference have been the topical focuses. Rather than demonstrating the ways that decolonial work (including pedagogy) often sidelines questions of gender and sexuality (Wilson & Laing, 2018), which is urgent and important work, this project is better situated to address the U.S.-centrism and white middle-class biases of efforts to promote gender and sexual difference. Before exploring queer and decolonial pedagogies, it will be grounding to explore the foundational tenets of dominant (read: Western, U.S., white, middle-class) frameworks. After exploring these frameworks, I will provide an overview of some of the most critical work that has emerged from examining queer pedagogies.  Later, I will draw upon decolonial pedagogies, which include insights from scholar-educators of color, human rights educators, and most importantly, Indigenous practitioners, whose lived and felt experiences of resisting coloniality are both acute and ongoing. Additionally, Indigenous educators’ contributions to decolonial pedagogies foreground deep intergenerational knowledge of how to live in meaningful relationship with land, non-human entities, mystery, difference, and uniqueness, which are   49 particularly important capacities in a time of immense climate and cultural devastation from Western-developed strategies of natural resource exploitation and monocultural domination. Disrespecting nature, placing a false faith in human supremacy, and forcing all of reality into rigid frameworks of knowledge are Western colonial legacies often embodied in the academic human sciences, legacies which we often rely upon in our efforts to promote gender and sexual difference.  This literature review will conclude with a preliminary outline of the features of queer-decolonial pedagogies, drawing upon the immense frames of resonance across queer and decolonial pedagogies, as an effort toward articulating an advocacy frame for gender and sexual difference that foregrounds cultural-climate diversity and survival. The preliminary outline has been developed from the points of resonance across the literature review and in conversation with those who have developed queer-decolonial pedagogies. Many of the features of this outline appear in the pedagogical practices elaborated in the Findings and Discussion chapter.  Dominant Pedagogies  Dominant pedagogies of gender and sexual difference are often devoid of political and epistemological critiques of systems of oppression, including colonialism, capitalism, militarism, racism, and xenophobia (Bonifacio & Rosenthal, 2015; Brill & Kenney, 2016; Castañeda, 2015; Ehrensaft, 2010; Germon, 2010; Marx, 1967; Repo, 2016; Testa, Coolhart, & Peta, 2015). When educators draw upon personal experience and legacy to shape their advocacy work for gender and sexual difference, there are often few pedagogical tools to turn to that can enframe their multiple commitments, and that demonstrate the immense importance of politicized commitments to difference and   50 diversity, ecological and cultural survival, decolonial critique, and antiracist solidarity work. Fortunately, a careful review of the historical and present production of dominant pedagogies of gender and sexual difference can clearly demonstrate precisely why the current tools available often disregard overlapping commitments to queerness and decoloniality.   Current dominant understandings of gender and sexual difference were largely shaped by medico-psychological sexologists and clinicians who sought to understand typologies (categories) and etiologies (causes) of gender and sexual difference, beginning in the late 19th century in Western Europe and the United States (Germon, 2010; Repo, 2016). While this work was ongoing during the last half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, it both intensified and took on new meanings post-WWII (Ordover, 2003). As the previous sections of this literature review have detailed, nationalistic and eugenic concerns in the U.S. focused on populating a nation with a dominant white citizenry that adhered to Christian notions of purity and authoritarian, patriarchal discipline, often bringing these beliefs and practices in line with neoliberal capitalism tied to global military and resource domination (Ordover, 2003). People who could not be easily categorized – and therefore incorporated, managed, and exploited – were viewed as a threat. Gender became a crux of such incorporation for management, disciplining those who did not fit as a means to discipline the larger population by threat (Karkazis, 2008).  At the Johns Hopkins University clinics of the 1950s, Dr. John Money focused on assimilating intersex infants, youth, and adults into heteronormative binary genders, noting that it would be easier to change intersex people to fit into dominant society than it   51 would be to change society’s treatment of those who are different than most. In the absence of definitive biological markers that could be used to predict the best binary gender role to assign intersex people, Money relied on their preferred gender role in a heterosexual partnership and in social life, noting that these solutions were imperfect. At that point, social gender and sexuality were still assumed to be intimately connected, even as sex itself was not within a binary. As this work expanded, others picked up the theorizing of gender and sexuality where Money left off (Germon, 2010; Repo 2016). One of the research projects that descended from Money’s work was housed at the UCLA Gender Identity Research Clinics in Southern California, led by Dr. Robert Stoller. Stoller believed that every individual had a deeper sense of their gender, and that it was more than a role preference, and was, in fact, a universally felt, inborn, unchanging, singular identity (Germon, 2010). His research focused on dividing up human bodies, personalities, and experiences into categories of biological sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, and gender presentation, with a marked focus on mind-body splits that portrayed diverse genders as pathological forms of self-understanding, and that so-called misaligned bodies needed to be brought into consonance with psychological identity (Repo, 2016). These assimilative impulses happened at a time when homosexuality was illegal in the state of California, and gender differences were used as predictors of criminal homosexuality (Canaday, 2011).  This framing drew upon Western medical and clinical norms that viewed difference as pathological, bodies as sites of evil or disease in need of intervention, and individuals primarily as anatomical subjects that were best understood through isolable body and mental structures (Foucault, 1989; Foucault 2003). It also drew upon Western   52 colonial norms that portrayed difference as threatening and potentially treasonous. The placement of these clinics in Southern California post-WWII during the rise of the military industrial complex and the national Red (communist) and Lavender (queer) Scares (Canaday, 2011) points us to the immense social and political influence the military and aerospace industries had on life possibilities for Southern California residents – particularly those who were portrayed as defying images of the California Dream as a happy, healthy, and productive lifestyle. Stoller also initially noted that his research had significant limitations because it was focused nearly exclusively on male-assigned youth who were born into white, middle class, Southern Californian nuclear families (Stoller, 1994). Our so-called universal theories of gender only speak of the normalizing anxieties of a very small group of people, namely, U.S. white middle class men and boys within a militaristic, settler colonial cultural context.  Queer, transgender, and feminist advocacy work has made strategic use of the non-determinism within Stoller’s model. For the first time, instead of portraying gender and sexual difference as sinful or criminal, it could be understood as a pathological illness that ought to warrant compassion because it was a condition a person was born with, rather than something a person chose (Germon, 2010). While relying on these narratives has been useful for some, they have also been violent, reductive, and politically limiting for others. Even as there have been immense movements to de-pathologize gender and sexual difference, the underlying logic of gender and sexual difference as an individual, inborn, quasi-pathological trait persists in modern research. Additionally, there are many who have residency in cultural contexts where gender and sexuality, as understood in Euro-American terms, are still intimately intertwined qualities of   53 personhood and who understand minds and bodies as intimately interconnected (Morgensen, 2011). Many cultures have roles for Third, Fourth, and sometimes Fifth genders, and see bodies as holistic entities connected to the rest of the natural world; other cultures see bodies as entities that ought not be intervened upon in mechanical ways (Leder, 1992).  These tensions are important to highlight because they shape much of the public pedagogies around gender and sexual difference (Luke, 1996). The most prevalent forms of advocacy for gender and sexual difference often rely on an understanding that they are innate or inborn qualities of persons, that they are primarily about sexual attraction or individual gender identity, and that they are individual identities parallel to a person’s sense of race, itself a constructed category, though with immense and very real consequences (Allen, 2012; Muñoz, 1999; Sherer, Ehrensaft, Baum, & Rosenthal, 2015). Feminist perspectives on pedagogy portray such advocacy as an embedded cultural practice that occurs both within and outside of formal learning environments (Luke, 1996). If we are to understand that most learning about life and culture happens outside of classrooms, and dominant understandings of gender and sexual difference circulate in popular culture, social media, (pseudo-)scientific research, family life, friend and peer groups, and academic classrooms, then it follows that interventions on these dominant understandings must exist in multiple contexts as well. The queer-decolonial educators foregrounded in this research necessarily work across multiple contexts.  It is perhaps even important to deemphasize interventions in formal educational settings as the primary or exclusive site of engagement, especially given the complex history that has limited school classrooms as sites for political engagement in our present   54 moment (Giroux, 2016; Olssen, 2006). Additionally, it is crucial that clinicians work to actively background their problematic understandings of personhood and difference, as misguided, self-serving, yet well-intentioned efforts often further entrench culturally particular, confusing, alienated, and overly-complex theorizations of gender and sexual difference (Ehrensaft, 2011, 2012). These pedagogies of difference often do not resonate with people across diverse cultural contexts – as will be elaborated in the Findings and Discussion sections – and in some moments, are used as forms of cultural imperialism here in the U.S. and abroad (Bacchetta, 2016; Haritaworn, Kuntsman, & Posocco, 2014).  Dominant pedagogies of difference have created isolation for queer and trans people in non-white communities, as dominant representations of queerness and transness are most often white and middle class, and have also allowed for racism, xenophobia, and colonial impulses to persist in many movements for queer and trans rights (Wilson & Laing, 2018). Additionally, the rhetoric of human rights, equal rights, and more, still rely upon frames of state-based democratic rights for individuals rather than communities, peoples, or entire ecosystems (Bajaj, Canlas, & Argenal, 2017; Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2012; Yang, 2015; Zembylas, 2017a). Queer-decolonial educators work to undo isolation across generation, peer groups, and cultural difference. Queer Pedagogies  While many questions of Euro-American cultural dominance are still often backgrounded in the most visible forms of queer and trans advocacy, there have been spaces of queer political thought and pedagogy that are immensely generative and supportive of solidarities across difference. Educators within this legacy advocate the   55 notion of queer-as-verb, rather than queer-as-identity, foregrounding the creative, resistant, and contextual meanings of queerness when they aren’t reduced to a category of innate sexual attraction or gender difference (Shlasko, 2005). Addressing how educators can queer their pedagogies, scholars bring attention to significant gaps in teacher training, and how schools, as institutions that dominate our imagination for educational possibilities, often serve as “gender ceremonies” (Pinar, 1998, p.154). Queer educators themselves emphasize the need to not only politicize students through sharing activism in classrooms, but that education itself should be a politicizing force. Others propel this discussion further by deconstructing our prevailing notions of the student/teacher and adult/child binary that pervade rationales that limit potentials for creatively reimagining how intergenerational teaching and learning might otherwise happen.   Educational researchers have been working on LGBTQ+ topics since before the 1970s, and most of that research has come from the disciplines of clinical psychology and public health (Kavanaugh, 2016). Research over the past decades has focused primarily on student and teacher experiences of homophobia, transphobia, and resilience, but little of it has looked at how to practically disrupt homophobia and transphobia, which would require focused interventions with educational professionals (Kavanaugh, 2016). Karen Graves (2012) notes that the field of education is much more expansive than just formal school settings, yet many gay, lesbian, and queer studies have not focused on schools themselves, leaving gaps between educational research and queer theorizing. Her work additionally asks critical questions about the near-exclusive focus on experiences of harm and exclusion and notes the need to illuminate the more ambivalent relationships that schools in particular, and education more broadly, have with its queers. The fact that   56 many queer-decolonial educators work outside of formal education speaks to this ambivalence, as will be explored later.  Pedagogical moments that happen outside the classrooms are part of what are described as “public pedagogies” by feminist researcher Carmen Luke (1996) and Angela Dwyer (2015), emphasizing that as highly adaptive social creatures, humans are learning everywhere, and all the time. Angela Dwyer (2015) notes that “spectacular pedagogies” (p.497) in public and educational contexts are moments where queer students or educators are visibly disciplined through violence both subtle and spectacular, and others draw upon these moments as cautionary tales against their own transgressions. While these scholars note the dearth of research that brings education research and queer theory together, Dwyer (2015) and Enke (2016) illuminate an additional lacuna of queer educational theorizing that seeks to understand how dynamics of race and English language abilities also inflect the experiences of queer students and educators.  Those engaged in educational praxis insist on queerness as informative of “pedagogies of discomfort” (Quilty, 2017, p.107), wherein educators draw upon imagination, critical reflection, emotion, and political calls-to-action that infuse learning with urgency, relevance, and deep meaning. While discomfort is often seen as an affective state that conflicts with learning, queer pedagogies foreground the creative potentials of discomfort that compel educators and learners to respond creatively. Aideen Quilty (2017) writes that discomforting pedagogies are also “pedagogies of disruption” (p.110) that intervene on normative narratives of gender and sexuality within classrooms and learning spaces, assumptions of hetero-norms and binary gender that are often at play but unspoken. In these framings, we again see a focus not on what queer is, but rather,   57 what it could mean (Waite, 2017). Stacey Waite also complicates our collapse of teaching, normative femininity, comfort, and care, noting the power of queer masculinities (and femininities) to disrupt stultifying pedagogies of affirmation. They delineate a notion of queer liquidity that defies ease of containment, creating dynamic flows of learning wherein students and educators can engage in serious intellectual play, co-constructing pedagogy the process (Waite, 2013, 2017). Teacher educator and queer scholar Reta Ugena Whitlock (2010) has articulated her understanding of queerness as a “resistant relation” rather than a “concrete embodiment,” (p. 81), resonant with framings of queer-as-verb rather than identity. She notes her concern that queer theory has lost its cutting political edge as it has gained academic acceptability, and notes that the work of queering is ongoing. “I have to work hard to be queer,” (p.81) is her motto, noting that queer is not a given truth of individual subjects, but it is a position in relation to normalizing dominant practices and institutions. She notes that queer “has a deliberately disruptive, political component, that is inextricable from yet not reducible to sexuality. Queer is about identifications rather than identity; in fact, it is about destabilizing social, cultural, political – all kinds – of structures,” (p. 82).  Whitlock (2010) refuses the reduction of queerness to sexuality and in so doing, repositions it as a vigilant political stance that is suspicious of normalizing institutional practices of all kinds, and decries the limitations of queer pedagogy when it is thoughtlessly grafted onto normative sites of education. Without radically reimagining what a queered pedagogy could be – for everyone – Whitlock expresses concern that queerness will be reduced to an additive difference that loses its political force. When   58 affirmation of identity and a focus on self-understanding are refused as the telos of queer belonging, we encounter what Whitlock identifies as an explosion of possibilities for identifying with others, rather than as queer. Solidarity work and blurring the clean lines between Self/Other has long been an imperative in queer cultural practices. Similarly, the refusal of “progress narratives” in Whitlock’s conceptions of queer pedagogy (p.103) refuses normative frames from developmental psychology that posit linear growth as the sole movement into queerness. Growth can be spiral, fractal, multivalent, and defy dominant conceptions of time which often privilege (adult) identity consolidation, invalidating experiences within states of becoming.  Along with Whitlock, Kevin Kumashiro (2002) notes the challenges to anti-oppressive pedagogy in teacher training programs, which, as noted before, are absent in the overwhelming majority of teacher training programs. Kumashiro points to queer activism itself as a form of public pedagogy, and that queer pedagogies are additionally a form of activism, even though it is important to note there aren’t many curricular tools available for these ends. Erica Meiners and Therese Quinn (2010) echo the importance of queer pedagogies grounded in activism and politics, as for many queer folks, the division between public and private is itself already a fiction. They also decry the political impoverishment of U.S. teacher education and note that impositions of professionalism are activated and mobilized to be restrictive of politics, suggesting that public, professional life is not the appropriate realm for teachers to express political viewpoints. More recently, Quinn and Meiners (2016) have emphasized that students need education in resistance, survival, and practices of sociality to foster solidarity across difference,   59 alluding to the need to bring queer education struggles into more intimate conversation with other social justice movements (Quinn & Meiners, 2016).  G.D. Shlasko (2005) asks what we can learn about pedagogy from queer theory, framing “queer as politic” (p.123) that can challenge normativities of many kinds. These questions sit alongside critical relationships to representation and interpretation of social cues and curricular materials. This suggests that we can learn to represent and interpret queerly, reading non-normativity into places where it might not readily be perceived as queer. Shlasko notes the multiplicities of queer within queer theory, and observes a vast need for queer pedagogies in the interest of students, queer topics and analyses, and for pleasure, as the latter is intimately linked to learning. Queer pedagogies carry immense implications for questioning complicity with violence, an important feature of any pedagogy designed for U.S. citizen-subjects who may not be aware of how patterns of material consumption and political apathy often perpetuate harm both domestically and abroad.  In emphasizing the ways that hospitality can serve as a link between individual and collective experience with resistance, Clio Stearns (2017) asks how we treat queer bodies in education – as invisible, as excessive, and as Other. Stearns states that queer pedagogy is an “offering up of an orientation rather than an analysis” (p. 2), refusing the confines of a theoretical truth, and instead emphasizing a relationality in flux that is dynamic rather than fixed, employing a queer art of ambiguity as an instructive tool of resistance. Stearns focuses on the need for queer politics to include racial politics, as they are mutually constitutive, historically speaking, and pushes discussions of hospitality further. She notes that “welcome” versus “hospitality” has a “connotation of pleasure” (p.   60 6), drawing attention to the fact that in many Euro-American contexts (in contrast to non-Western cultures) hospitality does not automatically connote pleasure.  Like Shlasko, Stearns (2017) illustrates a strong link between pleasure and learning that “positions the queer as permanent outsider” (p. 7) in education in response to fears of the non-normative, while simultaneously positioning queer pedagogues as those who can produce pleasurable experiences for others. For queer educators who are either invisible or hyper-visible – depending on context – questions of disembodiment and alienation are crucial sites of exploration, leaning into the need for queer pedagogy to include autobiographical realities (Grace & Benson, 2000). “Seeking and creativity” (Stearns, 2017, p.11) are bedrocks of queer pedagogy, as a non-finality subverts linear narratives of progress that have heavily shaped our understandings of queer comings-of-age. Queer-decolonial educators necessarily demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain this creative stance towards non-linear forms of learning.  Intervening on developmental narratives is essential in the work of queer pedagogies because, as Gabrielle Owen (2015) reminds us, “categories of age shape our experiences of ourselves and others,” (p. 110), pointing to the social construction of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood as mobile and emergent categories that do not stand the test of time nor of universality across place (Ariés, 1960; Lesko, 2012; Stockton, 2009). Queer pedagogies disrupt all notions of identity, including the binary divisions of adult/child and teacher/student which tend to be both “normalizing and exclusionary,” (Owen, 2015, p. 110). Owen (2015) proceeds by encouraging us to question “who gets to say what counts as knowledge?” (p. 127), emphasizing that the dominant associations of adolescence and defiance work to depoliticize both adolescent   61 perspectives and adult defiance by associating contestation with immaturity, and complicity with maturity. Our notions of maturity often include depoliticization, as the comforts of adulthood often emanate from further incorporation into political economies of employment and materialist consumption that rely on assimilation into neoliberal ideologies of success, narrowly defined through property ownership and class privilege.  Returning to the scholarship of Stacey Waite (2013), they remind us that as queer pedagogues, in efforts to destabilize the unidirectional flow of learning, we must remember that we have as much – if not more – to learn from our students as they do from us. Waite points to the need to challenge rigid ideas of participation that privilege verbal participation, reminding us that every speaker needs a listener, and that some learners process information in different ways and at different speeds. As queer youth are now coming-of-age in a moment that allows them to ask more of education and politics, adult queer educators are pushed to challenge their own internalized queer- and transphobias, to queer ourselves in ways that create more safety for students who are asking us to do so, sometimes directly and sometimes not (Keenan, 2017). Keenan’s work emphasizes the importance of humanizing ourselves as queer and trans educators, intervening on the depersonalizing imperatives that saturate much of teacher education and other sites of institutionalized human learning.  Deborah Britzman (2010), psychoanalyst and scholar of critical pedagogies, returns us to a discussion of educational pleasure, broaching the taboo topic that in Euro-American cultures, “learning involves erotic selves and fantasy life,” (p. 325). In addition to needing to demonstrate a willingness to learn from students, educators also must demonstrate a radical openness to being shaped by others, effectively embodying a   62 practice of the dissolution of rigid Self/Other distinctions. The “emotional situation of learning,” in Britzman’s words, is a “relational problem of trying to think with others,” (p. 326) that involves trying on other ideas and ways of being that may seem scary or foreign, but require imaginative boldness if we are to take on the task of dreaming new worlds. Britzman believes that “learning begins in frustration,” (p. 327) and to disregard this reality is to pretend that disruption, as noted earlier, is not a crucial motivating factor in deeper learning. Confronting unfamiliar difference through education and learning is an opportunity to make explicit the links between desire and curiosity, while simultaneously refusing facile answers that are merely affirming in their simplicity, yet not useful pedagogically, or politically. Britzman’s earlier work with Dippo (2000) critiqued teacher education programs as rushed, controlling, and calcifying of what is rendered knowable, leading to foreclosures in wonderment and a devaluation of questions. In the development of the art of questioning, they encourage us to wonder who is asking and why, as questions are never entirely innocent, and as self-reflexivity is an essential task for educators. Educating ought to be, in Britzman and Dippo’s understanding, a response to the world and a relationship that positions one to respond to urgency and crises. They are concerned that the professionalization of teachers depoliticizes them, as it takes the teacher out of the worlds where they may have previously sought to be impactful. Their work holds numerous tensions, including what they call awful thoughts, which are intended to suspend easy solutions, instead pushing teachers and students outside the realm of affirmative and clear answers, and into the realm of never-ending curiosity and critique. Affirmation, in Britzman’s (1995) definition is a homogenizing force that makes   63 queerness (and by extension, transness) recognizable and acceptable to white, cisgender, and heterosexual people; she mourns the difference and friction that are lost in the translation of concepts across differences in gender, sexuality, race, language, and culture, drawing our attention to the often-unnamed power imbalances between the interpreter and interpreted.  Queered conceptions of pedagogy are enlivening and contested ideological spaces where scholar-educators intersect their work in queer theorizing with their experiences as educators and living queerly. And yet, as dynamic as these engagements are, queer pedagogies often stop short of leaving others with any sense of precisely how to accomplish the proposed interventions; as much as it is important to refuse instrumentalizing theoretical engagement, it is also important to pursue explorations of what pedagogy can look like in action, and how it can meaningfully engage politicized frames of gender and sexuality – among other frames – in spaces of learning.  Decolonial Pedagogies  Decolonial thought and pedagogies often demonstrate a greater capacity to translate into teaching and learning practices than queer thought and pedagogies, which is not to say that queer theory does not lend itself to educational praxis. Rather, it is to demonstrate that documented scholarship is not the final step in creating meaningful shifts in educational experiences in the interest of queering and decolonizing pedagogy. Interestingly, as we turn our attention to decolonial pedagogies, it is noteworthy that these frames often do lend themselves to imagining precise classroom, teaching, or learning practices; however, because many of these pedagogical differences have been nurtured in cultural contexts that value orality, or storytelling, much of this knowledge   64 exists in the minds of elders and other educators, rather than in books and libraries. This section will attempt to provide an overview of the scholarship that does exist in writing, acknowledging the inevitable incompleteness of such an endeavor. While this approach may initially seem suspect, it is with great faith in epistemological experimentation that this research brings together thinkers who might not otherwise find themselves in resonance or proximity.   Decolonial pedagogy describes a diverse space of praxis, wherein scholars and educators who have critiques of multiple forms of colonialism, capitalism, nation-states, racism, and more think through questions of how political and theoretical critique might infuse learning experiences that focus on questions of agency and solidarity. Human Rights Education (HRE) pedagogies, Global South pedagogies, and Indigenous pedagogies will form the core of this literature review, even as they are spaces that are sometimes in ideological tension because of different legacies and priorities. Even when not explicitly familiar with scholarship within these disciplinary traditions, queer-decolonial educators demonstrate familiarity with their core concepts.  HRE pedagogies often foreground concepts developed in relation to United Nations (UN) Human Rights norms, though critical HRE scholars have questioned the universal applicability of such frames. Global South pedagogies have been shaped by those who descend from colonized peoples, or who currently live under forms of neo-colonization, and have hybrid spaces of engagement with post/decolonial thought and Western critical theory, as well as surviving Indigenous practices. Indigenous pedagogies often are developed in tension with international and national laws that continue to contour possibilities for national and cultural sovereignty, even as movements for   65 Indigenous rights have made strategic use of the UN to develop international Indigenous solidarity movements over recent decades (Niezen, 2003). I bring together these three spheres of decolonial pedagogies not to erase the immense historical, legal, and cultural particularity of their legacies, but to hold them alongside one another to begin exploring how they differently engage the work of survival, difference, and solidarity.   In Teachers as Cultural Workers: Letters to Those Who Dare to Teach, Paolo Freire (2005), renowned decolonial pedagogue, reminds us that educators must fundamentally live the life of an ongoing learner, effectively disrupting Western developmental narratives that separate teaching/learning and adult/child. While many assume such destabilization of educational roles might lead to chaos, Freire is firm in honing a sense of discipline in students, a discipline oriented towards democratic participation and practice, rather than toward punishment and normalization. The process of learning from students what their lives look like and what forms of political agency they have and need to build must inform the bedrock of any decolonial pedagogy.   As part of the critical legacy of HRE, Camilo Pérez-Bustillo (2016) draws attention to the need to decolonize “epistemology, history, theory, and practice” (p. 158), showing the multiple ways that decoloniality is understood. While some focus on re-envisioning ways of knowing and remaking ancestral practices to ensure both survival and contemporary meaning-making, others use decolonization specifically to reference restoration of Indigenous nations and lands, while others use it as a politic of solidarity across international borders (Niezen, 2003). Pérez-Bustillo draws links between coloniality, capitalism, militarism, and genocide, noting specifically that Indigenous peoples have been particularly astute in drawing upon human rights frames to advocate   66 for land sovereignty and cultural survival. Katz and Spero (2015) also note the complex and contested landscape of HRE, particularly as it is a newer subfield in the larger discipline of education; increased attention to the history, politics, and places that inform interpretations and manifestations of HRE will lend to furthering the nuance involved in such diverse invocations.   Michalinos Zembylas (2017a) insists on complicating the Eurocentrism of human rights frames, while also noting that it is not so simplistic as being only Eurocentric, as many engage with it strategically, thus infusing its possibilities with difference. Zembylas offers critiques of coloniality and the uneven invocation of human rights law across Europe, the U.S., and post/decolonial nations. He inserts the imperative that decolonial, human rights pedagogies must be intersectional and attend to differences in culture, language, place, and more (Zembylas, 2017a). Zembylas is holistic in his critique, noting that shifts in pedagogy are not enough on their own, and that pedagogical transformation must be informed by political and ideological shifts as well. The “recognition of epistemic diversity” (Zembylas, 2017b, p. 397) is a crucial feature of these shifts, and ought to include questioning our category of the human, which will necessarily include solidarity across different experiences of dehumanization, and to recognize that often, efforts at rehumanizing groups of people often rely on modernist assumptions that can be alienating for those who are not seeking Euro-American/Western cultural assimilation.   In the context of the United States, youth of color are asking “who is American, human, and worthy of dignity,” in classrooms observed by Bajaj, Ghaffar-Kucher, and Desai (2016, p. 482). They note that on the interpersonal level, youth experience harm that is shaped by much broader national and international discourses. Curriculum   67 development has the ability to impact politicization in order to help youth, educators, and school communities see personal harm as part of much larger systems of violence. To address harm, Bajaj, Ghaffar-Kucher, and Desai (2016) suggest a process involving rigorous scholarship and “incorporating the use of storytelling” (p. 492) because of the immense power of narratives that speak to larger social legacies. They urge us to consider the ways that history – which would necessarily include the colonial and normalizing legacies of institutions of formal education – is essential for contextualizing current struggles because they note that “schools do not exist in a vacuum,” (p. 500).   Nassim Noroozi’s (2015) work in philosophies of education provides counter-hegemonic critiques of what she calls Western “epistemic totality,” (p. 273), or, approaches to thinking wherein a singular and dominant idea controls all possible thought, to the exclusion of curious questions. Her work promotes the pedagogical power of what she calls “wonderment,” wherein “rigid dichotomies” (p. 275) and facile relations to difference are suspended, allowing educators and learners to steep in the generative space of non-assimilation. Education-as-assimilation is a legacy of the United States, particularly for Indigenous peoples, immigrants, those brought here forcibly, and poor people. Noroozi’s refusal of epistemic totality additionally rejects linear thinking and opens pedagogy up to diverse relationships to time, a powerful intervention on a Western (and Christian) teleology of finality, arrival, or salvation.  Noroozi (2016) simultaneously warns educators of the dangers of “hasty decolonization” (p. 137) by asking that we slow down our desires to create, represent, and interpret. Noroozi illustrates a process of layering interpretation, using the example of multiple “turns” (p. 137) in Quranic textual analysis, wherein a first turn of   68 interpretation is the process of translation across language, the second is interpreting the behavioral guidance offered in the text, and finally, the third turn is interpreting the context or specificity of such guidance, in the form of commentary. There is no total synthesis or resolution, suspending the drive toward integration and linear reading. She names this refusal as a “pedagogy of time” (p. 139) that rejects rushed and facile understandings that are ever-present in dominant U.S. systems of formal education.  Indigenous scholar-educators have long noted a clear difference between a Euro-American focus on time and a distinct focus on Indigenous epistemologies of place, or land. In “Late Identity,” Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang (2017) remind us that “in many Indigenous cosmologies, place is inextricable from ontology,” (p. 5) meaning that a sense of identity, of who one is, is necessarily connected to the land, ancestors, and non-human entities where one lives. Tuck and Yang (2017) also note that the term identity carries different meanings, at times used as a marker for violence or exclusion, at others used to inform a sense of belonging and place. It is also used to suggest both a sense of exploration or a sense of knowability-for-management (Foucault, 1975). With these varied interpretations of identity, it is important to note its role as a placeholder, often – but not always – masking questions of place, occupation, and displacement. Tuck and Yang (2017) note that, as a concept, identity has been immensely overworked, and we have tasked it with explaining and holding more meaning than it is capable of containing. They also insist that identity is often a “substitute for the analysis that needs to be done,” (p. 7). This analysis must include efforts that “challenge the terms of the nation-state,” (p. 8), which Tuck and Yang contend identity cannot do all on its own, at least not without   69 recourse to further interrogation of its specific deployment, and surely not without identity itself becoming a category of analysis or critique.  Further complexifying this discussion on the limits and possibilities of deployments of identity, and particularizing it within indigeneity, Sandy Grande (2000) notes that many invocations of identity in the Euro-American episteme substitute “radical social transformation with a politics of representation,” (p. 343). Grande emphasizes that Indigenous identity is focused on “sovereignty and self-determination,” (p. 343), positioning it differently than Western conceptions of identity development and recognition, insofar as it is quite literally grounded in a politics of place and cultural survival. Her work contributes to the development of decolonial pedagogies for Indigenous students, while also noting that pedagogy is not just for schools, but is also about the theoretical elaboration of a worldview; this work demonstrates that “the development of an Indigenous theory of liberation can itself be a politically transformative practice,” (p. 354).  Grande (2000) offers us both a theoretical space that opens identity up to complexification (especially because questioning essentialist identity in Indigenous contexts is challenging because Indigenous tribal recognition in the U.S. is often contingent on federal definitions of fixedness of culture and identity), as well as a “working definition of [Indigenous] Red Pedagogy,” which she distinguishes from Marxist Red Pedagogy. Her work offers four pillars of an Indigenous Red Pedagogy: sovereignty and an end to capitalism, Indigenous epistemologies as central thought-practices, “the Earth as its spiritual center,” and tribal cultural ways-of-being as social practice (p. 357).    70 Grande’s work insists that curricula engage decolonial political economic inquiry, deep knowledge of living in sustainable and reciprocally beneficial relationships with the natural world (including plant, animal, and ancestral life), knowledge of the ethical and spiritual dimensions of living, and practice with cultural protocols, ceremonies, and ways of demonstrating responsibility. In retelling the history of the Survival Schools, Madonna Thunder Hawk, a leader in the American Indian Movement, outlines the three subjects she focused on teaching when working with Indigenous youth: natural resources (living in right relationship with land and non-human life), law (engagement with the possibilities of and limitations to tribal sovereignty), and spirituality (recognizing the inseparability of ethico-spiritual content within socio-cultural life) (King & Castle, 2018).   Madonna Thunder Hawk’s work is firmly grounded in intergenerational learning, an essential feature of cultural survival and decolonial pedagogy. Rains, Archibald, and Deyhle (2000) note that, unfortunately and all-too-often, Native youth are coming into forms of self-understanding via non-Natives who are so-called experts, rather than elders in their communities. They state the importance of remembering that “Indigenous epistemologies and paradigms developed over thousands of years of sustained living on this land,” (p. 337) and that in the absence of transmitting knowledge intergenerationally, cultural survival and practices of resistance run serious risk of dormancy or atrophy. Because many Indigenous youth are learning from non-Indigenous educators, it is important that decolonizing studies include decolonizing all minds out of rigid approaches to scholarship and learning.  Linda Tuhiwai Smith and Eve Tuck (2018) situate their work in the field of education because it is their practical site of engagement, and because they see immense   71 value in engaging in research that is both legitimated by academic institutions while also engaging in projects that refuse the disciplinary regimes of Euro-American knowledge production. They focus on education because, in their terms, it is a “field that embraces change” and that is fundamentally “concerned with relationality,” (p. 8) in its most ideal moments.  Linking the mutually necessary work of decolonization and demilitarization, Smith and Tuck abide by the “inseparability of land sovereignty and body sovereignty” and that “in restoring traditional understandings of bodies to land, fluidity and tradition become complementary,” (p. 18). Such reflections bring us to a complex understanding of the risks for Indigenous nations of losing U.S. nation-state recognition, risks that accompany cultural adaptability and fluidity. These analyses demonstrate the immense importance of bringing Indigenous national sovereignty debates outside the exclusive terms and definitions set forth by settler nation-states.  Elaborating on the need to “remake” tradition (Waziyatawin & Yellow Bird, 2012, p. 12) as a refusal of the colonial anthropological influences that have frozen Indigenous cultures in (a past) time, Indigenous pedagogies describe decolonization as both an “event and a process,” (Waziyatawin & Yellow Bird, 2012, p. 3) which ought to include land-based education, intergenerational healing work within families to address historical and ongoing trauma, and a “decolonizing of gender roles,” (Waziyatawin & Yellow Bird, 2012, p. 3). Waziyatawin and Yellow Bird (2012) take a momentary step away from discussions of sovereignty in terms of rights bestowed or owed by nation-states, and reframe it in terms of “responsibilities” (p. 7) to land, non-human life, culture, Spirit, ancestors, and future generations. They note the courageousness of deep reflection   72 that is a part of re-envisioning what has been held near and dear, and that these efforts require intergenerational participation.

Wildcat (1991) go as far as saying that beyond the work of decolonization, Indigenous scholar-educators must also actively “indigenize” pedagogy (p. 31), noting that “indigenous means to ‘be of a place’.” In their work, they point to a powerful example of efforts to indigenize pedagogy in Gregory Cajete’s volume (1994), entitled Look to the Mountain: An Ecology of Indigenous Education, a work in which Cajete lists the foundations of Indigenous education, including holding a “sacred view of nature,” engaging in “mutual reciprocity,” recognizing “cycles within cycles” in the universe, “recogniz[ing] levels of maturity and readiness” in learners, holding “language as [a] sacred expression of breath,” and noticing that the pedagogical value of ritual lies in its reality as both “structure and process” for teaching (Cajete, 1994, p. 29-30).  Consonant with Noroozi and others, Cajete (1994) says that “learning requires letting go, growing, and reintegrating at successively higher levels of understanding” and that such learning often happens through storytelling because of its immense power to “root perspective” in a place and what happened there (p. 31). These kinds of pedagogical approaches successfully merge individuals and groups in ways that show immense respect for individuality without denying a fundamental relationality between all living beings. His work reminds us to value and seek out the multiplicities within all perspectives and stories, and that the freedom to do so often emerges in spaces of informal learning.    73 In these spaces, seeking holism is no longer a teleological goal, but is achieved through the process of learning, particularly through rituals and rites-of-passage that demarcate growth or maturation because in many Indigenous cultural contexts, individuation occurs at later stages of development than in Euro-American Western cultures. Conflict and irresolution are seen as generative teachers, and that disintegration of the self through introspection and engagement with the unconscious helps to root out self-deception. This work can only be accomplished through the careful guidance of elders. Cajete’s (1994) formulation of Indigenous pedagogies allows us to see the deep impoverishment present in Western, Euro-American pedagogies that hinge on pre-set goals and rigid evaluative models of success.  Decolonial pedagogies open up the imagination to re-envisioning not just structures and content within learning experiences, but for reflecting on the purpose and meaning of education more broadly. When pedagogy is situated within a present and urgent need for survival, access to land and livelihood are of paramount importance; grounding pedagogies in land, legacy, ancestors, and ongoing growth and change allow learners to stay connected both to what is most important, intergenerationally, and what their roles in social and cultural life might be, individually and uniquely.  Centering Indigenous pedagogies in outlining the commitments of decolonial pedagogies has not been done in the interest of appropriating what is useful for queer pedagogies and simply combining the two; these approaches have been brought together because they already live in dynamic tension for those who practice queer-decolonial pedagogies, given the complex personal histories and cultural legacies these practitioners embody. The following section will begin to engage within incommensurable spaces,   74 filling the canyons of epistemological difference between many decolonial and queer pedagogies with a curious humility. These efforts seek to honor the practice of stepping out onto a visitor’s bridge, peering across with an open hand and the recognition that interest does not necessarily entitle one to understanding, all the while working to pay respect to the reality that this bridge was built by others long before our arrival.  Queer-Decolonial Pedagogies  Finding what is shared across queer and decolonial pedagogies will form the foundation of the concluding section of this literature review, in addition to exploring the overlapping, hybrid space that is already lived by those who have been shaped by differences in gender and sexuality, legacies of racialization and racism, and coloniality and colonization. Queer and decolonial thought also have some shared critiques of dominant Western epistemologies, and these tensions, shared refusals, and resonant commitments to cultural survival and ethico-political engagement will help us to explore the power and hospitality of keeping questions alive in communities where formal and informal pedagogies shape imagination, persistence, and relationality.   Olga Talamante (2015) notes the poor engagement with LGBTQ struggles in the more widely documented history of Left, Chicanx, and Latinx social and political organizing, and that public representations of LGBTQ movements have been largely white, middle class, and male dominated. This is not to say that movements for racial and economic justice have not been propelled by queer and trans people, nor that queer and trans people of color have not been organizing for rights to gender and sexual difference for decades; it is simply to acknowledge that the history and dominant representations of these movements have excluded, ignored, and at times aggressively silenced the voices of   75 queer and trans people of color, immigrants, poor people, and Indigenous peoples. Queer-decolonial pedagogies, then, require the unearthing of “subjugated knowledges,” (Foucault, 1977; Foucault, 1980) through which we might come to better understand how movements based on identity can produce relations to authenticity that ask participants to foreground parts of themselves while de-emphasizing others (Rustin, 1965).   Coloniality is an important facet of analysis, as it inflects how queerness is learned, practiced, and policed, especially in settler colonial nations, like the United States (Frances, 2017). Garrett Nichols (2018) posits the value in attending to the potential harm of queer pedagogies that do not recognize Native peoples, lands, non-human life, and Indigenous epistemologies. He articulates a “decolonial queerscape pedagogy,” (p. 40), where space, knowledge, and bodies become sites of deep reflection and learning. Nichols’s work centers the contributions of Native queer and Two-Spirit scholars and activists, and notes that those invested in queer and decolonial pedagogies might do well to ally themselves with Native claims to sovereignty. This alliance is important not just in recognition of Native queer and Two-Spirit people and roles, but because of the connections between boarding school violence, the policing of Native gender and sexuality, and the policing of non-Native gender and sexuality in the production of U.S. citizen-subjects.   Nichols (2018) also critiques the fetish of “distance and objectivity” (p. 43) in pedagogical relationships and in research, and notes that disciplines themselves are infused with colonial alienation that splices reality, and regulates ways of knowing. To engage in a queer-decolonial pedagogy, he insists on contending with the history and legacy of settler colonialism. His formulation of “queerscape” is intended to address the   76 harm inherent in queer settler occupation of land, which seeks to assimilate place, people, and epistemology into the logics of the settler state. This is particularly important to engage, as many queers find themselves as guests on others’ lands through familial or community displacement. Because of a marked emphasis on land, Nichols reminds us that “classes do not end at the walls of our classrooms” (p. 51), illuminating that educators and students must respond to the communities they are – or seek to be – in relation with, including urban, rural, and reservation Natives. Nichols’s theoretical formulations of pedagogy are complex and generative, and point us in the direction of potential curricular materials, yet does not quite take us there.   In a conversation between Alex Wilson and Marie Laing (2018), an intergenerational space of oral pedagogy emerges. The two explore the project of queering Indigenous education, foregrounding narratives of queer and Two-Spirit Indigenous folks “coming in” (p. 131) rather than “coming out,” the latter concept focused on an individual assertion of identity in a way that requests a knowing recognition and acceptance; in the absence of such recognition or acceptance, a queer or trans person may experience a “coming out” as a rupture or moment of harm, potentially alienating a person from family, friends, home, community, spirituality, and more. In Wilson and Laing’s (2018) conversation, the concept of “coming in” refers to “individual and community empowered queer identities,” (p. 131) as part of the work of uprooting binaries and hierarchies that are drawn from colonial and Christian legacies that have invisibilized or assimilated forms of Indigenous difference into settler coloniality, particularly with regard to gender and sexuality norms. They describe the work of building social solidarity within communities, rather than only across them.     77  It is noteworthy that even as there are efforts to speak about queering decolonial and Indigenous pedagogies, there are far fewer efforts at decolonizing or indigenizing queer pedagogies, which rarely make any references to race or colonialism in their analyses of the roots of gender and sexuality oppression. It is possible that decolonizing or indigenizing queer pedagogies presents significant epistemic challenges, and this research seeks to specifically situate itself as a response to pedagogies of gender and sexual difference that are framed through clinical, colonial, white, and middle-class U.S. narratives of identity. Because of this intentional focus on decolonizing queer pedagogies, complementary work, like that reviewed above, that foregrounds the queering of Indigenous and other decolonial pedagogies, is best pursued by those who are embedded in Indigenous communities and ways-of-life.  While I do have a significant history of personal, professional, and pedagogical residence in communities of color, immigrant communities, and working-class communities, I seek to position myself in alliance (rather than identification) with others’ struggles. These include struggles against forms of racism different than those I experience, solidarity with those who survive class oppression, and recognition of immigrant and Indigenous experiences of displacement and discrimination.   Within this context, it may now be appropriate to begin delineating some of the potential features of a queer-decolonial pedagogy, where the hyphen connecting the two spaces of thought and practice is a contested relation that continues to foster vigilance over relations of history, culture, power, language, and place (Nichols, 2018). From the preceding reviews of queer and decolonial thought and pedagogies, I suggest the   78 following framework as an incipient exploration into what might be possible in the resonant tensions that bring together queer-decolonial pedagogical practices: Naming place/region – To intervene on universalized notions of what it is to be human or to be queer or trans, queer-decolonial pedagogies will look to the importance of place and region (Tuck & McKenzie, 2015). Identities are formed in intimate relation to places, and specific cultures form on particular landscapes. Naming place and region in this form of pedagogy will intervene on the production of a universal human subject, a production that often ignores intimate relations to place, whether they are of intergenerational residency, experiences of belonging/un-belonging, or alienation and rejection (Tuck & McKenzie; Wilson & Laing, 2018). There are immense tensions between decolonial – and Indigenous – relationships to land and the metronormative tropes of queerness that see (white, middle class) queer and trans people as free-floating subjects of modernity who may choose to live wherever they are able to assert gender and sexual difference in recognizable ways (Halberstam, 2005; Herring, 2010; Pini & Leach, 2011).  Time-play – Linear, developmental narratives of progress saturate discourses about land use, racial/evolutionary hierarchies, and queer and trans identity achievement (Castañeda, 2015). Queer-decolonial pedagogies draw historical and present links between different iterations of progress narratives in Euro-American, colonial epistemologies, with particular attention paid to the human sciences (i.e. anthropology, psychology, psychiatry, biology, medicine). Learning practices might include a refusal of rigid timelines, allowing lessons to fill as much space as needed, as well as complicating ideas of evaluation and success (Burman, 2016). True learning often does not know   79 precisely where it is headed in the beginning, and ought to stay open to forms of non-linear movement and curiosity (Cajete, 1994; Deloria & Wildcat, 1991).  Body/land sovereignty – Bodily and lifeway self-determination and the right to one’s home (whether that home is understood as a body, a neighborhood, a culture, a place, or lands) are central to queer-decolonial pedagogies (Butler, 1990, 2012). Displacement and alienation from body and/or land are central forms of violence enacted on youth, elders, women, queer and trans people, immigrants, and most notably Indigenous peoples, often in the interest of transforming living beings into resources for exploitation in settler colonial capitalism (Morgensen, 2011; Wilson, 2009). Building respect for individual and cultural senses of self, as well as the surrounding environment, will be central to the work of learning. Additionally, learning to care for bodies and land, and understanding the interconnections between care for the two, can help to ground educators and learners in practices of community and ecological reciprocity.  Experience as personal and intergenerational – Experience, as perceived, felt, and lived, is contextualized in community and culture. Queer-decolonial pedagogies emplace experience in history and legacy, noting that alienation and isolation often shape how experience is interpreted and represented. Experience is also intergenerational, and those with connections to ancestors, elders, or youth are well-situated to draw upon learning that accumulates over more than a single lifetime (Anzaldúa, 2012; Anzaldúa & Keating, 2015). Between queer and decolonial thought, questions of intergenerational learning are fraught, as many queer and trans people are cut off from meaningful relationships both with families and communities of origin, as well as from queer or trans elders; many queer and trans communities experience immense generational isolation.   80 For queer and trans people who are people of color, come from immigrant experience or legacy, are working-class, or are Indigenous, it is particularly challenging to make sense of life experience in the absence of mentors or elders who are of shared (or different) life experience.  Creativity and adaptation as cultural strengths – Colonial discourse has portrayed non-European cultures and peoples as static, fixed in time, and without a history or a future; however, remaking culture has long been a practice both in times of prosperity as well as in times of struggle or violence (Ogilvie, 2012). Indigenous cultures respond and adapt to changes in climate and through contact with others, as well as in response to emergent intra-group needs or in anticipation of coming events (Fabian, 2006). In some shared and unique ways, queer and trans people and cultures are creative and adaptive as well, particularly around body, artistic expression, language, sociality, and chosen kinship networks (Muñoz, 1999). Creativity and adaptation need to be celebrated as practices of cultural connection and survival in queer-decolonial pedagogies (Quesada, Gomez, & Vidal-Ortiz, 2015; Tongson, 2011).  Undoing colonial patriarchy – Adult male settler dominance in colonial contexts shape understandings of all other groups of people. These understandings often rely on rigid binaries, competitive hierarchies, and a deep sense of disconnect from places and other people. Unearthing hidden binaries and unconscious impulses to hierarchize is a crucial feature of queer-decolonial pedagogies, as colonial patriarchy often pushes us to assess who is most-human, most-authentic, or most-valuable (Spivak, 2004, 2012). These practices of queer-decoloniality seek to reestablish the innate relationality that exists between land, people, and all forms of life. Refusing colonial patriarchy will inevitably   81 include rejecting standardization of pedagogy, as each approach needs to demonstrate an attentiveness to the particularities of place, moment, educators, and learners (Morgensen, 2012).  Healing work – Bodily, emotional, intellectual, cultural, intergenerational, and spiritual healing must be deeply integrated into practices of queer-decolonial pedagogies. The multiple and layered individual and intergenerational traumas people and cultures have experienced must be given their proper place so that we may allow space for grief and mourning. This must be done both to honor what has been lost or taken, and to emotionally and strategically ready ourselves for the courageous work of forging ahead to remake possibilities for gender, sexuality, kinship, relations to spiritual practice, education, need fulfillment, legal protection, land and resource management, artistic practice, physical expression, and bodily care (Wilson, 2009; Wilson & Laing, 2018).  Role of Host-Guest in learning – Welcoming others into learning must be explored as a commitment to ongoing hospitality (Ranciére, 1991; Spivak, 2015). As queer-decolonial educators, we must bring balance to the roles of host and guest through learning when to exhibit patience, when to give direction, when to open ourselves up to the different or unfamiliar, when to ask questions with humility, when to ask questions to compel discomfort for learning, and when to quietly listen and reflect. As someone with residency in queer and trans communities, when I am in other spaces, I am a guest in others’ ways of living gender and sexuality, while I may also have opportunities to host moments of learning about gender and sexual difference. Conversely, when I am in queer and trans communities, I am often a guest in spaces that have largely been shaped by U.S., white, and middle-class norms of conduct, though these spaces often require that I   82 host challenging discussions about classism, racism, xenophobia, settler colonialism, and Euro-American epistemological dominance. Queer-decolonial pedagogies require that educators and learners explore how to sensitively and confidently navigate the role of host-guest in all moments, across varying contexts.  Critique for imagining otherwise – Teaching the art of critical and generative questions is a practice of imagination, of dreaming new possibilities through holding the present and past accountable to our highest hopes (Butler, 2012). Queer-decolonial pedagogies encourage critique in the legacy of deconstruction, which foregrounds the recognition of forms of destruction that have contoured the present, while putting construction – or world-building – firmly in the center of critique (Derrida, 2016). We do not critique to draw binaries between good/evil or to place ourselves in a moral hierarchy; we critique because it is our responsibility to insist on naming harm and noticing self-deception, all the while knowing that our strength often comes from asking better questions and making better mistakes (Cajete, 1994). These questions and mistakes support recognition of and interaction with the immense mystery of the universe, given that our abilities as humans are limited and we need to rely on multiple forms of knowing to live in more harmonious relationships with difference and complex legacies. Critique will be situated within interdisciplinary approaches to thinking and engaging with history, law, natural resources, current events, politics, storytelling, visual art, dance, music, martial arts, and more.  Learning for responsibility and joy – Education is intimately linked to responsibility, defined quite literally as the ability to respond to life, change, and others (Spivak, 2012). Within queer-decolonial pedagogies, learning is in the interest of   83 enabling thought and actions that are reflective, relevant, and relational. Fulfilling this responsibility can bring immense joy to learning and relationships, and spaces of teaching and learning can recognize that responsibility and joy need to be foundational to pedagogical praxis (Britzman, 2010). For those who have been kept from culture, kinship, land, embodied living, different ways of thinking, and more, relating to that which is outside one’s individual experiences can be difficult. Experiences with trauma can often make building mutually beneficial relationships fraught due to the entrenchment of coping mechanisms that have long outlived their usefulness. In this way, oppression is often isolating because of how we learn to be through it (Anzaldúa & Keating, 2015). Teaching responsibility and learning joy can intervene on isolation while building communities of support and healing.  Pedagogy as way-of-life – Such a framing of queer-decolonial pedagogies emphasizes that this work is an ethico-politico-spiritual way-of-life (Deloria & Wildcat, 1991; Giroux, 2016; Grande, 2000; Kumashiro, 2002; Moraga & Anzaldúa, 2015). This intellectual, emotional, and bodily labor allows educators and learners to be their whole selves, which includes recognition of history, legacy, culture, personality, difference, uniqueness, relationships, critique, affection, joy, mourning, and healing as essential realities to engage through processes of educating, or drawing out of ourselves to engage with others. It also suggests that within pedagogy, we each must develop the ability to move fluidly through moments of teaching and learning. This pedagogy acknowledges that every participant will at some point embody the role of host-guest, with attentiveness to dynamics of age, race, indigeneity, gender, sexuality, ability, class, and other experiences and differences.    84  This framework for queer-decolonial pedagogy is a cautious offering of mine. While it has been developed over fifteen years of education work within diverse community and educational contexts, it is not intended to be prescriptive. Such a framing of pedagogy must be approached non-dogmatically. Taking what is useful and backgrounding what does not suit a community or context are assessments that only a truly embedded pedagogue can make, in direct consultation with others. Because queer and decolonial pedagogies emanate from divergent cultural understandings of identity, land, spirituality, responsibility, individuality, and more, we must maintain strong senses of humility that will help us to avoid facile resolution and moral superiority. Any framework for a queer-decolonial pedagogy is necessarily responsive to place, history, and all those who find themselves making their best efforts to live together.                85 PART III: METHODOLOGY Restatement of the Purpose of the Study  The purpose of this study was to explore and document the connections between personal experience, cultural legacy, politicization, and pedagogy for queer-decolonial educators who work toward possibilities for solidarity and healing across culture, generation, gender, sexuality, class, immigration history, indigeneity, place/region, formal education levels, and more. Because many of the predominating pedagogical tools for teaching gender and sexual difference are both alienating and depoliticizing for many who are not from U.S.-born, white, and middle-class communities, queer-decolonial educators often work across multiple professional and cultural contexts to explore opportunities to uproot queerphobia and transphobia while building solidarity across and within difference. Queer-decolonial educators develop approaches to pedagogy that invite people to explore histories and present realities that can begin to heal the intersections of queerphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, racism, and other forms of violence that emanate from colonial legacies of monocultural domination. Their insights over the years have been formative in the shaping of this research. Research Questions 1. For queer-decolonial educators, how have life experiences and cultural legacies influenced their politics of resistance and solidarity? 2. For queer-decolonial educators, how have resistance and solidarity politics informed approaches to pedagogy in formal and informal learning contexts? 3. How do queer-decolonial educators describe the importance of addressing queerphobia, transphobia, and decoloniality simultaneously?   86 Situating the Researcher  This project was informed by personal experience and legacy, political commitments to solidarity across and within difference, and efforts to develop networks of intellectual and pedagogical support for queer-decolonial educators who seek frameworks and teaching tools (activities, texts, films, art projects, etc.) to address gender and sexual difference in culturally appropriate ways when working with youth, elders, students, and community members from varied cultural understandings of gender, sexuality, and learning. These efforts have been personally important because of the diverse cultural influences that have shaped my experience and understandings of queer and trans politics and identities, and the ways I have incorporated these histories and politics into pedagogical approaches for working with youth and adults from people of color, immigrant, and working-class communities.  I am multiply situated as a doctoral researcher, non-profit program manager, and community-based scholar and educator, working with diverse people across age/generation, geographic region, formal education level, race, culture, gender, sexuality, language, and immigration history. From this experience, I am made ever-aware of the ways that privilege functions to grant me access to social and institutional authority, while also simultaneously isolating me from realities very different from my own. The struggle to remain attentive to what initially appears as different, foreign, confusing, or frustrating is ongoing, and this project compels a curiosity that might lend itself to genuine questions that seek greater understanding, more precise critique, and enhanced capacities for building sustained community relationships within a small network of queer-decolonial educators. These educators are working towards greater   87 freedom for gender and sexual difference alongside and within other social and political struggles for community self-determination, even when gender and sexuality are not the focus of engagement.   Because I sought to emplace myself both in California and the Bay Area – as well as in relation to research participants – and because this research has been inspired by methodologies and methods of autohistoria-teoría, I strove to find ways to use personal experience as one point of departure among many, while simultaneously working to de-center individual experience in an effort to better understand connections between historical, legal, institutional, social, community, and individual forces that shape life, relationality, and connections to people, place, and legacy. These efforts required a vigilant experimentation with research, writing, history-telling, politics, and pedagogy. Such experiments are justified by both a tradition of queer political and intellectual creativity as well as the urgent need in our present moment to intervene on erasures of history and experience on the margins.  Research Design  This research project draws upon two interdisciplinary frameworks in order to illuminate connections between queer-decolonial educators’ personal histories, cultural legacies, experiences of politicization, and pedagogical approaches to teaching about gender and sexual difference. To locate this work in a community-accountable research frame (Jafri, 2017; Talley, 2013), this project engages approaches derived from decolonial and Indigenous methodologies and methods (Tuck & McKenzie, 2015; Smith & Tuck, 2018). Such work emplaces social science/ethnographic data collection in context and in relationships to avoid deracinated analyses that fail to take the social,   88 cultural, and natural surroundings of an inquiry into account (Bernard, 2006; Carspecken, 1996). In the spirit of linking experience and politics, Scott Lauria Morgensen reminds us that decolonial methodologies imply activist imperatives in challenging “normative knowledge production” as a colonial endeavor (Morgensen, 2012, p. 805).Through a participatory process, I worked collaboratively with research participants to engage qualitative interviews inspired by Anzaldúan autohistoria-teoría (Anzaldúa & Keating, 2015), which draws upon decades of feminist- and queer-of-color scholarship that insists on the importance of personal experience and legacy as a point of departure for illuminating and elaborating theories of social and political resistance as a ways-of-life embedded in communities of practice (Muñoz, 2010).  Qualitative Interviews Inspired by Autohistoria-teoría In making the most meaning of theoretical and historical inquiry, personal experience and legacy is an essential contextualizing element. Moving alongside qualitative methodologies and methods, autohistoria-teoría illuminates Gloria Anzaldúa’s insistence in Luz en lo Oscuro – her dissertation compiled and edited by Keating - that “I am the one who writes and is being written[.] It is the writing that ‘writes’ me,” (Anzaldúa & Keating, 2015, p. 3). Through storytelling, theorizing, and inextricably fusing the two, autohistoria-teoría is a methodological space – as well as a method of writing - that uses rigorous narrative engagement to expand concepts of relevance, knowability, and contextualized critical thought within experience and legacy. To pursue this kind of writing is to “construct alternative roads, creating new topographies and geographies of hybrid selves who transcend binaries and de-polarize potential allies,” (Anzaldúa & Keating, 2015, p. 82). The research participants   89 interviewed for this project simultaneously historicize and theorize personal experiences, and I sought to carefully document and represent their practices of autohistory-theorizing.   Anzaldúa’s conceptualization of autohistoria-teoría was elaborated, with the help of Keating, within a legacy of feminist- and queer-of-color scholarship that has foregrounded the deep connections between personal experience, political engagement, and social and literary creativity (Bacchetta, 2009; Moraga & Anzaldúa, 2015). Breaking down binaries of private/public, personal/political, queer/straight, woman/man, has been part of queer and feminist resistance and pedagogies for decades in the United States, and Indigenous cultural relationships to difference and duality have lived here in the Americas for thousands of years (Deloria, 1998; Dunbar-Ortiz, 2015). This inquiry strove to contribute to this ongoing legacy of thought, scholarship, and political and pedagogical engagement that clearly names the patriarchal, colonial, and Western dominance of knowledge-production and circulation that fundamentally shapes possibilities for what is seen as legitimate and rigorous (Anzaldúa & Keating, 2015; Chatterji, Buluswar, & and Kaur, 2016; Smith & Tuck, 2018).  Qualitative, ethnographic-inspired approaches to research, which are deeply resonant with autohistoria-teoría, and queer theory, “share conceptual and purposeful affinities: both refuse received notions of orthodox methodologies and focus instead on fluidity, intersubjectivity and responsiveness to particularities,” (Jones & Adams, 2010, p. 197). Such self-storying may work to counter the assumption, articulated by Linda Tuhiwai Smith (2005), in educational research that “schooling is inherently good” for marginalized and dominated peoples, and that dominant pedagogies work to destroy “epistemic self-determination.” Even as Smith was articulating the harm done to   90 Indigenous peoples through state-based education and research, her analysis may be applied to queer students and educators as well, particularly as “fluidity and dynamism characterize queer thought,” (Jones & Adams, 2010, p. 204) running counter to the standardized and rigid pedagogical approaches of the status quo. Those interviewed for this project engaged in their own autohistoria-teorías, and the discussion of these interviews is an attempt to collectivize this self-his/storying and auto-theorizing. Community-Accountable Research Community-accountable research was first articulated by Pauline Alexis Gumbs, a black feminist scholar (Jafri, 2017; Talley, 2013), who described the importance of intervening on the isolation between researchers and the worlds that have shaped them. The specific community-accountable methods I draw upon have been articulated within an emergent framework of Critical Place Inquiry, which is an interdisciplinary approach to research that foregrounds questions of settler coloniality, place, relationality, and methodological openness and creativity, often informed by decolonial, anticolonial, and Indigenous perspectives (Smith & Tuck, 2018; Tuck & McKenzie, 2015).  The relationships between place/land, researcher/researched community, and political commitments to self-determination are present not just topically, but epistemologically (our ways of knowing), ontologically (our understandings of what it is to be alive), and axiologically (how we place value on ways of being, knowing, and doing). Epistemology, ontology, and axiology shape methodology, which is what “drives and informs how [...] methods are used, and with and by whom,” (Tuck & McKenzie, 2015, p. 79). Such forms of inquiry do not permit “body/identity/place to be regarded as separate,” (Tuck & McKenzie, 2015, p. 37). In the context of this research that seeks to   91 critique (and offer alternatives to) universalized pedagogies of gender and sexual difference, these community-accountable methods are an important intervention into colonial methodologies of singular truth that purposively erase difference, discord, and multiplicity.   This project is shaped by narrative inquiry, participatory community-accountable inquiry, and strategic methodologies that may be gathered under the overarching field of Critical Place Inquiry, where place is understood both as the natural locations that we are connected to, as well as particular settings and cultural environments. Here, narrative inquiry will include elements of oral history and auto/ethnographic-inspired frameworks of qualitative interview research and self-writing (Tuck & McKenzie, 2015, p. 82-83). Community-accountable research necessarily considers the insights, needs, experiences, and desires of the community that is being researched in order to infuse research with increased relevance and political urgency (Chatterji, 2000).  Furthermore, this project is fundamentally strategic, as it fuels and is fueled by efforts to construct curricula and destabilize the separation of queer theoretical critique and community-based pedagogies of gender and sexual difference that attend to diverse cultural, spiritual, and political needs. While validity and legitimacy in social science research are generally assessed through “obedience to prescribed rules,” critical place inquiry emphasizes “relational validity” (Tuck & McKenzie, 2015, p.157), defined as “mutual implication” (Tuck & McKenzie, 2015, p. 163), evidencing the reality that we exist in relation to the people and places in which we study, and that the layered dynamics that tether self to Other, people to place, and knower to known must be actively named and challenged.   92  Tuck extends her framing of community-accountable research by noting that it is essentially a collaborative process of examining and articulating strategies of resistance (Tuck, 2009a). She notes the inevitable reality of risk-taking involved in this process, wherein the mutuality of relationships contours trust and the sharing of responsibility. The participatory process also allows for more diverse voices, including those of youth and elders, to emerge, and for cultures of storytelling to flourish (Tuck, 2009a). She highlights four advantages to this kind of research: sovereignty, contention, balance, and relationship. She figures sovereignty as the idea that what is experienced is real and true, and recognizes the wholeness of all beings that have a right to non-interference in their ways of knowing and living. Contention involves gaining knowledge to protest injustice to interrupt dominance – complicity with domination – while balance provides “a counter to latent dogmatism” (Tuck, 2009a, p. 60) that involves gaining the capacity to discern truth from contexts of prolific falsehoods, as well as a way to negotiate the needs of individuals and communities. In exploring both the “space between people(s)” and the “space between ideas,” Tuck (2009a, p. 61) emphasizes the need for accountable relationships that can allow for clear lines of Self/Other to dissolve, linking her work to Anzaldúa’s imperative of nos/otras (“we/others”).   Weaving together community-accountable methods and qualitative interviews inspired by autohistoria-teoría, this research intends to create a collective process of documenting autohistoria-teoría, bringing diverse narratives and reflections on experience (through politics and pedagogy) into conversation with one another. This is done in the interest of crafting, together, some initial foundations for the ethical and practical imperatives of a queer-decolonial pedagogy. While qualitative, ethnographic-  93 inspired methods are often employed by the individuals articulating them, collectivizing autoethnographic analysis is an attempt to ‘queer’ research by destabilizing the lines between I-you-we-they (Brown & Nash, 2010). These are serious methodological experiments, and can only be accomplished through deep and ongoing relationships with pedagogical practitioners.  Research Participants  The participants in this research are queer-decolonial educators with whom I have worked personally, professionally, or politically over the past decade that I have spent as a community-based educator in the Bay Area of California. Participants are also educators who explore the ways that intersecting histories of domination have shaped their own politics, resistance, and pedagogy, and who additionally insist that struggles for queer and trans rights must live in solidarity with other forms of oppression because of imbrications in history that co-produce identities (Bacchetta, 2013). Through engaging such complexly situated educators, I sought to understand how personal experience and legacy shape politics and resistance, which further influence pedagogies of gender and sexual difference, even when gender and sexuality are not the topic of focus.   Research participants were drawn from a small network of diverse educators with whom I have either previously worked or discussed this academic work. These educators expressed solidarity and excitement with the spirit and intention of this project and were eager to contribute to a scholarly documentation of community-accountable efforts to create more robust, historically-grounded, and diverse representations of queer and trans politics and identities. Many of the research participants hold graduate degrees and are from groups that have historically faced many challenges in achieving educational equity.    94 I recruited six queer-decolonial educators for extended interviews, lasting between ninety minutes and three hours, and have used this project as a way to bring particular individuals together in an intentional way to begin to craft frameworks and training materials for hosting learning experiences about gender and sexual difference that are historically intersectional, politically grounded in creative interventions, and attentive to the cultural and intellectual needs of diverse communities and student-learners, as well as being adaptable across multiple contexts. These queer-decolonial educators work across formal and informal educational settings, and they see their work as focused on intra- and inter-community solidarity and healing work.  Participant Sketches  Pseudonyms for participants were selected by the participants themselves. Those who wanted to maintain their names were able to do so as well. Some participants wanted to be identified by their initials only, and I have respected each individuals’ wishes in these matters. Fredrick Fredrick is a Black-Japanese elder in his sixties who has lived in the United States for the majority of his adult life, though he was born in Japan. He was raised and educated primarily on military bases in Japan, Hawai’i, and New Mexico, among other places, for the first fifteen years of his life. Fredrick went on to coach competitive young women’s volleyball, an athletic career that took him to every major city in the U.S. in his twenties. Fredrick found himself drawn to Zen Buddhism while living in Denver, and was reminded of the cultural context he grew up in during his early years in Japan. He spent time living and working at the Zen Center in Buffalo, New York. Upon return to   95 civilian life, Fredrick turned to diversity training and consulting for businesses and non-profits during the rise of multiculturalism in the 1990s and 2000s. A little later, he began studying postcolonial- and feminist-oriented social and cultural anthropology, obtaining an M.A. and nearly completing a Ph.D. before leaving to pursue creative non-fiction writing. His first book, Dream of the Water Children: Memory and Mourning in the Black Pacific, is a rich work of history, memory, poetry, and critical cultural politics. Fredrick currently spends his time engaging in public speaking events, favoring the multi-speaker panel format because of the multiple voices and perspectives that he draws upon to educate the public in dynamic and engaging analytic storytelling.  Harper Harper is in his early-mid thirties and was born on the East Coast near Washington D.C. and spent a year and a half living in Taiwan in a neighborhood for U.S. government employees. His family returned to the D.C. area before he started school and after a couple years, moved to rural Maryland, where he finished his public-school education. During his undergraduate years, Harper studied abroad in South African and worked with international NGOs focused on LGBTQ+ advocacy. After returning to the U.S. and graduating from college, he moved into LGBTQ+ non-profit work before becoming certified as a public-school teacher in New York. Harper taught early elementary school for a few years before moving to California and starting a Ph.D. in Education. His scholarly work and educational advocacy have focused on the ways that nationalist narratives and gendered training permeate elementary school education in the United States. He has also started a network of support for trans educators who seek to have a greater role in developing materials for teaching gender diversity.    96 STS STS is in their fifties and was raised in the Los Angeles area during the rise of the military-industrial complex; their family – like so many – had come to Southern California before STS’s birth seeking work in the emergent aerospace industry. STS grew up both in working-class multi-racial neighborhoods as well as middle-class mostly-white neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area before moving to Seattle. STS self-identifies as a survivor of the UCLA Gender Identity Research Clinics, which were formative in developing our current concepts of “gender identity” through clinical experimental research on white, middle-class children and youth. During their time in Seattle, STS became active in HIV/AIDS advocacy work, communities focused on sobriety from alcohol and drugs, and anti-racist work. They currently teach gender and women’s studies courses at a public university and also host art exhibitions and workshops focused on gender and racial diversity.  JM JM is in his early thirties was born and raised on the San Francisco Peninsula before moving to Sacramento, a shift he describes as one from inner-city, Filipinx neighborhoods, to suburban, upper middle-class, culturally assimilated ones. He has been immersed in artistic practices, including film- and zine-making, and brings these practices into his non-profit informal education work with queer and trans youth in public schools in the Bay Area. JM also participates in the survival of Filipinx ancestral life-ways, focused on plant medicine healing, and serves as a teaching assistant for an elder-healer. He plans to continue learning ancestral plant medicine while also exploring possible opportunities to return to graduate school.    97 Desi Desi’s life has been marked by movement across rural and urban settings, between Louisiana and California. Now in her early-mid thirties, she has worked in university-based LGBTQ+ advocacy work and in religious/spiritual communities who have been focused on queer/trans inclusion. Over the past several years, Desi has turned to eco-justice work, at the intersections of promoting biological and cultural diversity. She has worked on organic farms and has made use of these experiences to develop land-based pedagogies, which are practices that use natural, biological, environmental, and food growing contexts as points of departure for learning experiences. Desi currently works for Movement Generation, an educational and advocacy organization that helps professionals and community members who work across diverse justice issues come together to understand the links between their different areas of focus.  Luz Luz is a mixed, Indigenous (Yaqui/Yoeme) scholar in her late-twenties, and an activist-educator whose work explores the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, indigeneity, spirituality, and environmental preservation. She was born and raised in the Central Valley of California and has previously involved herself in anarchist, housing-access, food-access, harm reduction, and other direct-action advocacy work. She has traveled the world as a professional hula dancer and is immersed in Indigenous communities and cultural lifeways; Luz has taught in both formal and informal educational contexts, and currently teaches at a public university in the Bay Area in Ethnic Studies. Her work speaks powerfully to spiritual activism as a grounding framework for pedagogy.     98 Community-Accountable and Narrative Research Methods I used semi-structured and unstructured interview techniques with study participants, depending upon the level of familiarity and length of relationship I have with each individual; semi-structured and unstructured interviews are a crucial feature of research inspired by ethnographic methods because they require immense preparation and familiarity with the research context while also allowing for the contradictory, the unexpected, and the complex to emerge through individual narratives (Gupta & Ferguson, 1997; Mills & Morton, 2013). While these interviews were less intensive and more focused than formal oral history collection, I asked participants in-depth questions about personal and family legacies, im/migration experiences, political self-formation, educational experiences, and pedagogical commitments and practices.  Community-accountable and participatory elements of this project included sharing the queer-decolonial pedagogies framework with participants after their interviews and allowing them opportunities to ask clarifying questions about the history and methodologies that inform this project. Additionally, I have shared the findings and discussion with participants in order to ensure that their voices and experiences have been recorded with integrity. This project also intends to be an initial step towards developing a curriculum collaborative of diverse queer and trans educators working across various educational contexts, and therefore participation in this work will continue long after the scope of formal research has come to an end. While I initially intended to host a focus group where participants would be invited to come together to share artifacts (writing, lesson plans, curricula, activities, etc.), scheduling difficulties prevented this from coming to fruition. I maintained researcher’s journal to reflect on each interview and each   99 step of the research process to add layers of reflection and to ensure that my perspective is distinguished from the perspectives of the research participants.  Research Process  Interview protocols included a pre-brief and consent form, an interview, and a debrief with a reminder of available follow-up support opportunities should participants want or need them. Participants have had access to the queer-decolonial pedagogies framework, and opportunities for follow-up have been created. There was a low risk associated with these interviews because of ongoing and sustained relationships, as well as intentional research participant selection. This research was approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before any interviews commenced, even as this project is a documentation of ongoing individual and community discussions. Consent forms and a copy of the guiding questionnaire for semi- and un-structured interviews can be found in the Appendix.   Interviews included a pre-brief, a formal interview, and a debrief. The pre-brief conversation reminded participants of the project – which had been previously discussed with each selected interview participant. I asked about any off-limit topics for our formal interview, and additionally asked if there are any topics in particular that they do want to explore, in order to better prepare questions together so we may both reflect on and prepare to discuss these topics before the formal interview.  The second stage was the formal interview, where I began by documenting basic demographic information before segueing into questions of personal experience and legacy related to resistance and assimilation, development of political commitments in connection with queer or trans experience (among others), and ways that these   100 experiences and political orientations have shaped their relationships to and practices of pedagogy, all the while asking about the links between. I asked about different constraints across formal and informal educational contexts, and what foreclosures and opportunities they perceive across context and community. We pursued responses to immensely open-ended questions in order to allow research participants to articulate what queerness, politicization, and pedagogy mean to them, and to place this within experience and legacy both within and outside of family and community relationships, an important feature when working on queer topics of cultural inheritance.   After creating transcripts, I shared them with each participant for their review to ensure I collected their narratives with integrity and to allow for clarification or editing of points that did not come through clearly in our formal interview. After validating these transcripts with each participant, I discussed themes that emerged within their own narrative, as well as themes that emerged across interviews. Before submitting to my committee for final comments, I will sent the full discussion to research participants for their feedback on my elaboration and analysis of the collective narratives.    Throughout this entire research process, I kept a researcher’s journal, where I documented my own reflections, tensions, and hopes for what this process might be in the context of a research project, and beyond. This journal helped to distinguish my voice from the research participants’ voices in the writing of the research findings and discussion; this practice also allowed me to document what was illuminated for me in the process of research without having to wait until the formal writing of the discussion, findings, and conclusions from the interviews. This researcher’s journal was more robust that traditional research note-taking and incorporated elements of autohistoría-teoría.    101 Exposition and Analysis of Narratives In analyzing my research findings, I have drawn heavily upon the interdisciplinary collection of theories known as intersectionality, critical education studies, and queer-of-color and decolonial thought. These enframing notional spaces will shape the themes I elucidate in my analysis and will also encourage attentiveness to the responsibility and ethical questions foregrounded in decolonial and queer research (Bacchetta, 2013; Chatterji, et. al., 2016; Visweswaran, 1994). Mobile analyses attend to fluidity and dynamism of experience and perspective, shifting with context and participants’ narrative emphases. The exposition and analysis focus on themes of personal experience and legacy, history of politicization, and how all these influences shape pedagogical praxis for queer-decolonial educators.   Layering personal narratives, political and pedagogical commitments, and theoretical research provided a kaleidoscopic and ever-shifting center of attention, moving across individual, community, and structural analyses to demonstrate the interwoven layers of historical, political, and personal realities. The discussion draws upon Anzaldúan autohistoria-teoría and participatory approaches, as a respectful gesture towards ancestral legacies of emplaced storytelling that contributes to critical epistemology and pedagogy (Anzaldúa & Keating, 2015). This narrative form also serves as a political and ethical intervention on dominant, constraining, and highly gendered relationships to truth, legitimacy, and rigid frameworks of rigor present in dominant legacies of educational and narrative research.    I transcribed and coded the data myself. I did not make use of any coding software, but developed a collection of themes that emerged across interviews, and noted   102 particular themes that repeated within individual interviews in surprising or compelling ways. I created a graphic representation of the themes present in each interview and additionally looked at the particular ways that themes emerged within and across self-identifications of gender, race, culture, class, immigration history, and other experiences or identities. Because I did not want the first interviews transcribed and coded to greatly impact the way I identified new or emergent themes as I worked through the transcription and coding work, I re-read the transcripts multiple times in different orders, allowing a few days in between each re-reading.   Each transcript was sent to its corresponding research participant for verification, and to ensure that I was not going to share any information they did not want shared publicly. I decided that, in order to ensure clarity for readers of this research, I would organize the findings and discussion in direct response to the three research questions. It was also decided that because there are analyses of their own experiences infused within the interview responses, it made the most sense to combine the findings and discussion sections, as there was no way to completely separate the two. Additionally, because of the exploratory nature of this research, it became apparent that I would need to be as direct as possible regarding how participants’ responses and reflections connected to the purpose of the study.          103 PART IV: EXPERIENCE INFLUENCING POLITICS Introduction and Context  Due to the highly contextual nature of these findings, this chapter and the following two will comprise the findings and discussions sections; similarly, to promote clarity, the findings and discussion chapters will be sequenced in the order of the three main research questions, with subsections denoting themes across interviews. Such an organization of the findings and discussion chapters will allow the reader to see the clarity of interview participant responses with regard to each of the three research questions by giving each question its own chapter. Similarly, as joint findings/discussions chapters, this sequencing of findings/discussion will also help to demonstrate the connections between the individual participants and their experience, politics, and pedagogy in ways that foreground integrity of context, particularly as themes of place, mobility, multiplicity, and responsibility were present throughout the research interviews.  Question 1: For Queer-Decolonial Educators, how have life experiences and cultural legacies influenced their politics of resistance and solidarity? Overview  In providing responses to the first research question, participants spoke to many similar themes. One of the most noteworthy among these was the mobility across diverse contexts of place/region, social groups, national borders, socioeconomic class, gender, sexuality, language, culture, and more. Within these movements, many experienced a multitude of forms of violence, a second theme that emerged with great clarity. The forms of harm people endured ranged from physical and police violence, to gendered and homophobic harm, and also included often less recognized forms such as clinical,   104 educational, cultural, and family violence, among others. Within these experiences, participants have remained open to the ways they have learned from and been indelibly shaped by such violence. From all they have participated in and witnessed, both within and outside of formal education, the six research participants each articulated incredibly nuanced relationships to a multiplicity of ways of knowing and being, particularly with regard to the social and political realities that shape senses of self, and how these senses of self are deeply connected to strategic social, educational, and political interventions.  Participants see these interventions as a responsibility that could be described as personal and cultural commitments to the legacies to which they are connected, as well as to those who have lived and learned differently than they have.  Mobility Across Diverse Contexts  Queer-decolonial educators are individuals who move across many different kinds of learning and educating contexts. This movement is characterized both by movement across multiple cultural contexts as well as by movement between formal and informal educational settings.  Movement Across Cultural Spaces  Queer-decolonial educators share many experiential features, and one of the most prominent that emerged from the participants during interviews was their mobility across diverse contexts. Fredrick, narrating his birth in Japan and upbringing in Japan, Hawai’i, and Albuquerque, reflected that he “became aware of culturally politics early,” given that he changed schools every two to three years, both on and off military bases. His experience moving across national, cultural, and linguistic contexts shaped his ideas of adapting to different norms from place to place. While many people are inclined to   105 believe his adaptability is due to his mixed-race experience, he insists that he’s “a military brat” and that such movement isn’t always primarily disruptive, but that “you just learn [to be] good with change and difference” and finds that most people are not that way. While traveling as a volleyball coach during his twenties, he was able to visit nearly every major city in the United States by age twenty-nine, and he noted the diversity across different regions while also observing that identity-policing shaped a certain homogeneity around recognizable gayness or queerness in the gay men’s bar scene.   When reflecting on what stands out most to him about U.S. culture, particularly around identity and belonging – but also in reference to learning and education – Fredrick notes that “people in America especially view everything in different categories... everything is about being separated and divided” and he attributes our “divide-and-conquer” politics to this impulse to splice groups into discrete and easily recognizable stereotypes. Having traveled broadly throughout the U.S. as well as between the continental U.S., Hawai’i, and Japan, such observations come from the perspective of someone moving between changing cultural norms.   Harper, like Fredrick, had experience spending a significant amount of time in East Asia as a very young person. His parents were employed by the U.S. federal government and his family was sent to live in Taiwan for a year and a half during his preschool years. Though Harper’s family did not have ancestry in East Asia, the exposure to a cultural context where he was a racialized minority in the country more broadly is placed alongside his experience as a racialized majority in the neighborhood of federal workers. He reflects that after returning to the U.S. he “had a sense that there were other places outside the U.S....now as a person who works in Early Childhood Education [it’s]   106 not always typical of white kids that grow up in the U.S.,” pointing to the U.S.-centrism of much of preschool through undergraduate education here. Harper notes that most youth grow up in the United States thinking that this is the only place in the world that exists.   Even after returning to the United States for elementary school, Harper’s world continued to be full of diversity. His classmates were from all over the world in his neighborhood school, in the county adjacent to the District of Columbia. The difference of his world atrophied when his parents decided to move from urban-suburban D.C. to rural Maryland, which was much more homogeneous, with a “high population of evangelical Christians” who were “very much Republican, very conservative.” Previously, gender norms were inflected by cultural diversity, “not because there were a ton of genderqueer kids, but because some of the girls were wearing hijabs, some of the boys were more hypermasculine and some were not, [and] there were gay parents at the school.” Transitioning into a much more monocultural setting severely limited the representations of gender that were visible in Harper’s world, leading to his targeting as an androgynous child. Harper notes that “all different contexts have different ideas about what ‘normal’ is.”  During his undergraduate years, Harper studied abroad in South Africa and conducted research that became his senior project. The focus was on trans masculinity in the South African context, and his work was housed within an NGO that focused on LGBTQ+ advocacy and drew upon Euro-American understandings of gender, sexuality, and identity. The organization provided information on accessing hormones and surgeries for medical transition and was asking Harper to help them understand the unique   107 constellation of gendered roles, practices, and identities that existed, particularly in indigenous and spiritual traditions. He also noted there was a challenging legacy of coercive medical transitions where gay, lesbian, and queer people were encouraged to get sex changes during the apartheid government. Because Harper had familiarized himself with LGBTQ+ advocacy in the United States, he noted the similarity of education and advocacy in a very different cultural context, especially because he saw more opportunities to engage with particular local understandings of gender and sexual difference. He elaborated: In South Africa, for example, there’s a long history of sangomas, which are traditional Zulu healers, who take on spirits of ancestors and sometimes that is cross-gender. So, there’s that, there’s also more recently a term that is called ‘lesbian men’ that is kind of a more masculine spectrum person who was assigned or called female at birth, and so the words are just different. Luz’s experience of navigating racial, class, political, and cultural differences in a single city in the Central Valley of California provides powerful insight into the ways that mobility across diverse cultural contexts does not even necessarily require a person to leave one’s hometown. She described the experience of moving from her neighborhood school, which was predominantly attended by students of color, to a GATE (accelerated/gifted learning) program at a predominantly white school across town. She noted that “I remember that was one of the first times where I realized, oh yeah, I’m the only brown person in the class.” Although she is mixed-race, she was raised by her single mother and her mother’s family, who are all white: “I thought I was white so I didn’t really realize that other people saw me as different until being in a completely white   108 space.” Unused to standing out in spaces of learning, she struggled without support, and left the GATE school before the end of the year to return to her neighborhood school.   Moving between having consistent housing and squatting (temporarily living in abandoned homes or buildings) frames Luz’s experience during her late teen years. She left high school early at age fifteen years after taking the GED to attend Modesto Junior College, and began participating in anarchist communities and political organizing.  After she “started reading lots of anarchist and anti-authoritarian literature,” she came to understand that “rent is theft”, and experimented for a couple years with living rent-free as a squatter with other young people. During the post-2008 era of mass foreclosures in the Central Valley, there were many vacant houses, some of which still had running water and electricity.  Other formative experiences during these years include immersion in Hawai’ian cultural, artistic, and spiritual practices, particularly through her training and travel as a professional hula dancer, which she said that “some people understand as a hobby. I definitely understood it as a life-way.” Luz eventually moved from the rural-suburban Central Valley to urban California (Oakland), in order to continue more rigorous training. Moving across diverse regions of California has sharpened her nuanced perspective on regional politics, economic struggles, and dynamics of racialization and gender, which look very different across the state. Her professional hula travels, combined with personal travel, have taken her to Japan, Korea, Western Europe, North Africa, Mexico, the Middle East, and South America.  The other three research participants also had noteworthy movement across contexts. STS described growing up in a “more racially mixed, far more working class”   109 neighborhood in Santa Monica before moving across town to a predominantly white and middle-class community in Los Angeles, and how this shaped their understanding of the different politics across cultural spaces because they’d “always hung out with folks of color.” They also lived in diverse social circles during their young adulthood in Seattle, spending time largely with women of color and indigenous elders, as well as queers, sex workers, substance ab/users, and folks who were living with HIV/AIDS. JM experienced a significant move from an inner-city urban upbringing in Christian and Catholic schools to public schools in “a very white-washed elitist suburban community,” naming the noteworthy shift from an urban setting dominated by diasporic Filipinx culture to one dominated by assimilationist class and race imperatives. As an adult professional, JM works in San Francisco across the diversely racialized and classed neighborhoods of the city, and notes that how their race and gender is commented on or not shifts from neighborhood to neighborhood. Desi highlighted movement from rural Louisiana to suburban Southern California, and noted the cultural, linguistic, class, and racial shifts she witnessed in her family through that process; she notes that her mom “really wanted upward mobility,” after having spent her entire life in poverty. She also emphasizes that her multiple shifts in professional contexts have shaped her perspective on just how differently various fields operate; she has worked in LGBTQ+ non-profits, universities, spiritual communities and institutions, farms, co-operatives, and has moved between both direct-service and administrative work.   It is important to emphasize the mobility these research participants have across a multitude of contexts because it highlights their exposure to many different ways that people interact, speak, make decisions, develop interpersonal relationships, discuss (or   110 don’t discuss) politics, and how expectations of people are shaped by assumptions of race, gender, sexuality, class, language abilities, and more. There is reason to believe that familiarity with such diverse ways of thinking and being is an important foundational facet for Queer-Decolonial Educators, in that they have a deep understanding of just how important it is to embody cultural humility when engaging topics like culture, family, gender, sexuality, and colonialism. Without knowing how differently people may think, speak, feel, and respond, these educators would likely not be able to anticipate how to shape materials that speak to multiple cultural understandings of gender, sexuality, and inclusion.  Movement Between Sites of Formal and Informal Education and Learning  A particular facet of movement across contexts in participants’ narratives is mobility between spaces of formal and information education. Each participant had experience in formal K-12 education, most in public K-12 schools, but some with a combination of private and public schools, and only one exclusively with Christian private schools. Fredrick experienced schools in Japan, Hawai’i, and the continental U.S., and included schools both on and off military bases – he emphasized the immense adjustment between military base and non-military base schools particularly because “military bases are walled off and you’re in another world.” In addition to formal education, he also had athletic training and coaching experience, arguably a very powerful and kinesthetic learning environment, alongside his spiritual training in Zen Buddhism. Fredrick also draws upon oral/storytelling learning within his family, both from multicultural Japanese and U.S. family lines, in part because he doesn’t want to be “disconnected from history” like most Americans. In his own practices as an educator,   111 Fredrick has mostly taught outside of classrooms, largely in professional, academic, and community settings such as workshops, trainings, conferences, panel speaking events, and as a featured speaker.   STS expressed immense appreciation for the community organizing and education work they participated in as a young adult living in Seattle during the HIV/AIDS crisis: “we made safe sex packages and a little myth card in 1987 and we’d go out the bars and try to talk to lesbians.” They expressed the importance of learning within peer networks about how to reduce the likelihood of transmission and learning how and where to publicize this information was a critical part of an education around social, health, and political strategy. Storytelling and oral traditions from within STS’s Irish-American family, as well as through mentorship from women of color and indigenous elders, position them to have deep respect for learning that takes place outside of classrooms. One of STS’s most formative sites of learning has been Alcoholics Anonymous; though they cite some problematics with the group and its infusion with Christianity, they note how important it has been in terms of bringing them a sense of responsibility and integration, something they bring into their practice as an educator. STS has “talked at a lot of conferences and told [their] life story” through the AA network about their story of recovery and these practices of holism are infused in their classroom practices, which has included teaching at elite public universities. Other community education work has involved art projects in gallery spaces, public performances, and anti-racist workshops.   Harper has served as a public-school teacher in kindergarten classrooms in New York, but before that, he worked in LGBTQ+ advocacy non-profits and community   112 organizing programs. He currently works in a teacher education program at an elite private university, working with students who are preparing to work in elementary school classrooms. Other community education work involves facilitating the Trans Educator Network, a de-centralized collective of transgender and non-binary educators across the country who are invested in gender and racial justice work. Harper’s focus on Early Childhood Education involves a focus on “dramatic and imaginative” play-work, and he often draws upon his experience facilitating outdoor and backpacking summer camp education from his young adult years.   Intergenerational learning forms the bedrock of JM’s learning experiences. He credits his grandmother, a Filipinx immigrant, with giving him his sense of “self-agency” and schooling him on the discriminatory ways of the world, and how to best navigate it. Currently, JM is studying Filipinx plant medicine with a Filipinx elder in Berkeley, and he serves as a teaching assistant for community-based class focused on “Filipinx herbalism and folk and ancestral practices.” He also runs support groups for queer and trans youth, and despite the fact that these groups take place in public middle schools in San Francisco, his groups go to great efforts to eschew the limitations often imposed by classroom settings, drawing upon his experiences in community-based education. Artistic both by nature and by training, JM is a film-maker and a zine creator, insisting that visuality is a crucial element in learning, particularly for those who have struggle with being more verbal and outgoing. He also places great value in “horizontal” (peer) learning amongst educator colleagues through participation in Teachers 4 Social Justice and the Trans Educator Network.    113  Desi’s experiences as a learner span across classrooms, farms, non-profits, and family oral history and storytelling. There is a rich oral tradition in her rural Louisiana Cajun-Creole family and she has spent trips documenting and recording conversations and stories told by elders in her family, notably her grandmother. She reciprocates this learning by sharing information with family members about how faithful communities navigate the challenges and aspirations LGBTQ+ inclusion, where she draws upon her experience working directly with leaders in faith communities in the Bay Area who are “open and affirming.” Her experience in “Christian school kindergarten through twelfth grade” provided her with cultural familiarity for engaging in these often-sensitive discussions because, as she noted “there isn’t just one way to be Christian.”  Desi has worked more recently on teaching/learning farms, notably at UC Santa Cruz’s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) apprenticeship program. She expresses a deep regard for experiential, hands-on, “land-based learning about agroecology and sustainability”, which involves interacting directly with natural processes, such as growing food or observing natural ecosystems. She has learned a great deal about opening conversations about “intergenerational land-based traumas” – traumas that emanate from displacement, environmental degradation, or the use of agricultural or extractive labor as a form of violence – that keep communities of color and indigenous folks from engaging in self-sufficiency practices and she has also highly credited peer learning from indigenous folks around her. Desi has brought these complex perspectives into her work at Movement Generation, a “Justice and Ecology Project” that insists of drawing the links across a multitude of social justice issues through training institutes that   114 focus on engaging a diverse array of non-profit, community-based advocacy, and educational professionals.   Luz’s narrative of informal learning is particularly compelling, especially in relation to her explicit decision to leave high school for “political and dance-related reasons”. At age fifteen, after beginning to familiarize herself with anarchist politics, and she “became very omnivorous about the political types of critiques [she] was reading about and none of that [was] going to happen in high school,” at which point she took the GED and began taking community college courses and continuing her political education through community and autodidactic pursuits. Additionally, her commitment to her development as a professional dancer within a politic of indigenous cultural survivance shaped scheduling needs, and the traditional school schedule inhibited her ability to travel and train.  After leaving public high school, Luz began spending more time in public libraries, where she came across anarchist community organizers who offered her opportunities to participate in protests, zine development and printing, and tactical political strategizing for economic, housing, animal, food-access, and environmental justice issues. Between spaces of indigenous and anarchist learning, she forged a strong cultural and political belief in the power of informal education. Alongside her experiences of street learning through squatting and spending time outside of the somewhat protective realm of school, she also has participated in self-defense training (both as a learner and trainer) and has been involved in providing direct support for substance users, including a then-illegal needle exchange program. Currently, she teaches Ethnic and Gender Studies courses at a university and strongly believes that education is   115 inherently political, and is an important element in dominant indoctrination, but can also be a powerful tool for the radical politicization of students.   These personal experiences as learners and educators across diverse contexts have shaped research participants’ political and social outlook on the role of education. Such diverse exposure has had the effect of multiplying the imaginative possibilities in the minds of the participants and shapes how they conceive of political relationships to difference and diversity. Such a politic of difference is an important part in navigating discussions of gender and sexual difference in diverse communities, and Queer-Decolonial Educators rely upon this politic of difference in order to be responsive to the cultural and ideological socializations amongst the learners with whom they interact.  Familiarity with Violence  Each of the participants in this study narrated experiences with multiple forms of violence, both in the social worlds they moved through as well as within the schools they attended. Additionally, research participants each had deep understandings of the broader historical, political, and social context in which such forms of violence were experienced, and that these understandings are infused in the formation of their political views that show up within pedagogical practices, which will be discussed in later sections. The links between experience and political situatedness become acutely clear when we explore the layers of self-formation that occur in response to the difficulties that emerge from such violent experiences. Participants described adultism in school and family life, physical harm, police violence, gender policing, racial discrimination, clinical coercion, classism, cultural erasure, and experiences of isolation and un-belonging. Connecting this section to the previous one, it is also important to state that many of these Queer-Decolonial   116 Educators pursued informal/community learning experiences as part of reimagining how to relate to their own education, broadly understood, amidst experiences of harm in schools.   STS does not have memories that pre-date experiences of violence; they are a survivor of early childhood sexual abuse, and had “four major surgeries before the age of eight.” Their memory of these surgeries is one of clinical harm, wherein doctors and nurses manipulated their young body with heavy sedatives while providing no gentleness, comfort, or explanation for what was going on. STS was exposed to large doses of ether and opioids on multiple occasions before the age of eight and sees this chemical exposure as a crucial element in their later struggles with and addiction to alcohol. Today, in their mid-fifties, STS is “over thirty years sober.”  Around age seven or eight, STS’s family physician recommended they be sent to the Gender Identity Research Clinic (GIRC) at the University of California, Los Angeles. STS’s doctor and parents had become concerned about how STS’s gender difference might be indication that they were developing into a person with a queer sexuality – over the years spent going to the GIRC at UCLA, STS was “pulled out of school often.” Upon their return to school after each visit to the clinic, they would be questioned by their classmates about where they had gone, which exacerbated feelings of alienation from school that they were already experiencing because of ableism surrounding dyslexia. While at the clinic, STS and their parents would be routinely interrogated in a clinical setting by psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, sometimes together and sometimes individually. STS faults the UCLA GIRC with fomenting immense tensions within their family, including the distance that developed between them and their father after their   117 father was accused of having too heavy of a masculine influence on STS, essentially blaming him for their queerness and gender difference.  Additional blame was placed on STS’s mother, as was the trend at the time, during an era of “positive eugenics” that portrayed white mothers as the demographic most responsible for raising healthy, happy, and productive white children to populate the California Dream and increase the numbers of a so-called superior race of people. The gender normativity of the white middle classes of Southern California – embedded within the emergent military industrial complex – was and is deeply connected to the gender normativity of U.S. military masculinity, and the domestic, passive femininity that is its foil. STS perceived the rigidification of gendered expectations when they moved from a mixed-race community to a nearly all-white community.  In fifth grade, STS remembers having their “first encounter with police violence” when a male friend who was black was falsely accused of stealing a purse, with no witnesses to the alleged crime. The police arrested him and took him to jail for the weekend at the word of white people who had not seen him steal anything, nor did he have any purse on him at the time of his arrest. This moment of police impunity left an indelible impression on STS. Later, after moving to Seattle, they had their own experiences with police violence, and bearing witness to multiple instances has shaped their anti-police politics and organizing over the decades.  STS’s sense of queer political activity was forged in the challenging moments of the HIV/AIDS crisis. When asked about the formation of their queer politic, they replied, simply, “my friends were dying” and they needed to do something. Losing many within their friend and social circles had a traumatic impact not only on STS, but an entire   118 generation of queer folks. STS and I have spoken multiple times about the immense experiential divide across generations of queers, and this moment of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s is crucial to understanding some of the roots of those divides; younger queer folks do not have an acute memory of the political, social, and medical abandonment of so many whose lives were taken not by the virus, but by the unwillingness of those in positions of power to do anything to prevent so many deaths. Queer identity is never simply about a person’s sense of sexuality – it is deeply embedded in the social and political milieu of each era and place.  Fredrick, another queer elder, describes acute memories of police violence. His first memory witnessing police violence in the U.S. took place in Albuquerque during the Vietnam War when protests broke out that quickly turned into a riot. He recalled that between fifty and sixty police cars arrived at a park where hundreds of young people had gathered and a major clash ensued, with guns drawn and protestors “flipping police vehicles over,” at which point Fredrick leapt from the vehicle he was in and ran from the scene. As a young child, he had also witnessed racial violence between U.S. military servicemembers in Japan when white soldiers “forced black soldiers onto the ground to lick their boots”; the military was still segregated during the post-WWII period of time as well.  Many of Fredrick’s most vivid memories of harm occurred in his early years of school on U.S. military bases and in the U.S. Japanese was his first language and he very much identifies as culturally Japanese. His first time in an English-only school was on a U.S. military base as a six-year old and he recalled a moment regarding his class’s recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Because he barely spoke English, he didn’t   119 understand what was going on and initially refused to stand, and then once made to stand, did not put his hand over his heart, nor did he recite the Pledge. In response to his confusion, he remembers: the teacher pull[ed] me by the ear to the principal’s office and it hurt and I didn’t understand why. The principal asked me why I wasn’t reciting the pledge, if I was a communist...he said a communist was a bad person and I had to stop being a communist. In another moment on a military base school, Fredrick says the class was asked the question: “What makes a good boy or a good girl?” to which he replied “A good boy is a boy who knows how to make money and go to war and arrange flowers and write poetry,” a response that was ridiculed by the students and the teacher, who called him a “sissy” in front of the entire class. Fredrick strongly believes that adultism is perhaps the most crucial of all the “-isms” that we need to address in order to understand broader structures of authoritarian hierarchy: “[Adults] think they’re entitled, their morality is authorized and they don’t realize people have different moralities, especially kids.” He said it “would save us a lot of trouble” to address adultism head-on and use that framework to look at all other forms of domination and oppression through that lens.  Later experiences with police and physical violence occurred during the period in his life when he was spending time in gay bars. He remembers that the police raided the bars in Albuquerque about once a month, and that the bars themselves were not even necessarily a safe space for him because of the racism in the gay male community. Additionally, young white men often patrolled outside of gay bars, carrying metal chains, and Fredrick recalls having to run away to avoid severe physical violence. To help ensure   120 his safety, his mother often gave him rides to and from the gay bars beginning at age sixteen. As an insomniac – partly in response to traumatic stress from night-time air raids by the U.S. military in Japan during WWII – his mother was often up all night and had no issue with him being queer, as she herself had told him she “also liked women, especially women in uniform” when he told her he liked men.  Luz shared a litany of instances of school violence, many of which contributed to her choice to leave high school after her sophomore year to take the GED and begin attending community college two years early. In addition to experiences of racial discrimination in school, she was also actively pulled to address injustices in her community, which she would not have had the time to do had she been in school all day. Witnessing racial- and class-based environmental injustices in the rural-suburban Central Valley motivated her to use her abilities to contribute to local resistance and organizing movements. She had left high school to further pursue an education in philosophy, anarchism, and anti-authoritarianism and came into environmental organizing via animal rights protests. Through this work, Luz became familiar with the ways immigrant and undocumented communities were specifically targeted for exposure to toxins from agrobusinesses that surround Modesto, California.  Adultism often dictates which environments are safe for youth and which aren’t, providing limited spaces where youth can find the adult support that they might need. When a young person makes the decision to leave the safety “net” (of sorts) of public schools, they are often ill-prepared to be aware of the dangers that exist for youth. Early on in her time out of public high school, Luz experienced a near-abduction while walking through her neighborhood, and this was not her last experience with this form of   121 gendered youth-targeting violence. She cites this experience as incredible formative – a “game-changer” – and woke her up to the realities of how quickly life can change and how anyone could be at risk for experiencing such violence, leading her different self-defense strategies that she carried with her into her time squatting in abandoned homes and buildings.  In her late teen years, Luz was proximate to police violence and state surveillance via her “harm reduction/needle exchange project” work in support of drug users in the Modesto area. At the time, though needle exchange programs were proliferating in more progressive parts of the state, counties in Central California were policed by law enforcement entities that continued to benefit from criminalizing these types of projects. “Learning more about the Drug War and how that impacted [her] community”, Luz was able to situate her experience, and the experiences of those around her, in a larger context through research and civic participation in local public convenings. On one occasion, she happened to miss a day of needle exchange work, and on that very day, two of her close friends and program partners were arrested and charged with crimes for helping drug users access clean needles.  Luz also noted the violence of people’s curiosity about her political activities, stating that “it’s none of their business about my politics because most of my political activity has taken place outside of the realm of the law” in relation to the connection between people’s curiosity and the rise of surveillance state tactics post-9/11. “If you’re doing real work, it needs to be quiet” and that people doing this type of organizing and activism often do not publicize themselves because of the risks of police targeting.   122 People’s ignorance around the importance of privacy can often lead to immense consequences for those whose advocacy work is criminalized by state entities.  The other three research participants also articulated experiences with adultism, school violence, and gender policing. Harper recalls feeling immense pressure to appear more homogeneously female in his nearly-all-white rural schools, and notes the violence that comes from being seen as different by others in more homogeneous communities. As a very young person in Taiwan, he remembers a shopkeeper who would not allow his mom to buy a blue outfit for him because “blue is for boys.” Harper has also made references to being worn down during his high school years because of his queer activism and advocacy and that he nearly dropped out because of the immense emotional labor it took to continue attending school. Now, as an adult educator, he notes the curricular violence within public school that he believes shapes possibilities for politicization against the “nationalist narrative of U.S. history” and “how gender is scripted in children’s lives.” He has also witnessed the epistemic violence of Western understandings of gender in South African NGO work led by European-descended settlers who attempt advocacy work with tribal groups.  Multiplicity and Refusing Homogeneity  From experience moving across diverse contexts and social worlds, alongside experiencing multiple forms of violence, Queer-Decolonial Educators described to me many practices they have regarding an embrace of multiplicity and refusals of homogeneity. Because these educators have seen how violence and facile understandings of difference often go hand-in-hand, their politics of difference includes space for others to be multiple, not fully understandable, yet still deserving of respectful treatment,   123 particularly in learning environments. Many of their political beliefs rest firmly in the immense value of leaving identity more open, and leaving themselves open to the unknown and complex. These educators additionally have made use of identity both as a form of resistance and as forms of strategic essentialism (Spivak, 2004, 2012, 2015).   From Desi’s experiences of isolation, as a Black youth in predominantly white Christian schools, she has gained a sensitivity towards the multiplicities present across different Christian identities; additional layers of complexity have included the ways that Christianity in Black communities of rural Louisiana look very different than Christian communities in the multicultural Bay Area. Having a sensitivity to the particular role place and region play in sense of self and identity have shaped a political outlook that requires she continually challenge her own assumptions about people. How individuals and groups relate to the identity term “Christian” looks so different across generation, region, race, and denomination, in her experience. She engages in a practice of “holding complexity and knowing whoever you’re working with or whatever space you’re in, there’s going to be something more complex than what you thought was in the room going into it.” Many of her understandings of this complexity comes from ecosystems thinking derived from her land-based work; she describes natural environments as simultaneously integrated yet multiple, and has also said that land is a powerful way to develop a sense of one’s belonging. She also notes her view that there is a certain “cultural queerness” of her Afro-Creole-Cajun family, and that queerness isn’t merely about gender or sexuality, but it’s also about the ways that queerness shows up in particular cultural contexts. Desi has relatives who have been non-monogamous, who have dated queerly on the “down   124 low,” and that how outness appears varies across generations in her family. Any fears she held about coming out to her mom as a young person came from dominant media narratives of white kids coming out to their families, rather than from any real sense she had of her mom’s ethics and politics. From these experiences of environmental and cultural diversity, she engages in a concerted refusal of what she calls “oppositional politics,” instead opting to seek out forms of resonance across vast differences of experience, and to help people resituate their political beliefs and cultural biases in a larger context of unavoidable interconnection and diversity.   JM has similar reflections, but in his narrative, such awareness of diversity relates to class diversity within communities of color. Having moved across working, middle, and upper middle-class contexts throughout his family and professional life, he knows there are multiple ways to live as a person of color. In his understanding, queerness itself is multiple, because: It’s a place where many different parts of ourselves meet and we’re able to hold space for each other’s friendships, so all the things that I learned about queerness growing up that I didn’t have the language for, that’s allowed to be here...all these experiences can exist.  JM – as a self-identified introvert – is also personally, pedagogically, and politically committed to different learning styles and personalities. He notes that professional and educational spaces often foreground extroverts and that the world needs to have a tighter embrace of individuals and ways of being that are not always quick to speak or act, or who need quiet time to reflect and observe. JM insists that in a “globalized, multicultural society” we need to teach people how to navigate worlds of   125 difference, and how to acknowledge the interconnectedness of all life: “How do we learn and awaken to what is all around us and not deny that there is diversity within us and around us?” He believes it is important to have feelings of care for all beings around us and that we need to learn to not “live in fear of cultural stereotypes” that often precede the complex reality of those with whom we come in contact.   When exploring questions of multiplicity and identity, Fredrick draws upon his training in Zen Buddhism, where he learned that “words are the poison but you can’t get away from words, so then words become strategy,” naming the reality that words are containers that carry meaning, and such meaning is shifting and perspectival. Coming from a mixed-race and mixed-cultural experience, he has a deeply felt sense of the multiplicity of interpretation with regard to phenomena in the perceived/felt world. Within his experiences of isolation and senses of un-belonging, Fredrick found a certain freedom to craft himself as he pleased, keeping distance between himself and the misinterpretation he often felt when around others who tried to categorize him. He states that he was never confused about his sense of self, that it was always other people who were confused about him.   Fredrick offered powerful critiques of the aesthetic homogeneity of white-dominated gay male spaces, focusing on the “body fascism” and how it intersected with racial expectations of gay maleness. He has always felt uncomfortable with the “boundaries and rules and regulations” and sexism present among many social worlds of gay men, particularly because of his own fluid sexuality. His mother had always told him that psychic survival would depend on an ability to “pretend like you’re normal, but you don’t have to be,” nodding to a multiplicity that exists between one’s sense of one’s self   126 and other’s sense of you. Fredrick lamented, “the whole thing is everyone seems to know what a human is,” and uses that in a disciplinary and regulatory way. Fredrick is deeply committed to a multiplicity in our notions of what constitutes humanity, rather than relying on homogeneous or universalist norms.   Fredrick finds it important to “make everything multiple” when doing intellectual or political work, as a strategy in pushing people to question closely-held ideas of universalistic humanism. “Multiplicity isn’t complicated to me,” he states, continuing, “it’s complicated to other people who view things in separate categories,” and that his idea of queerness is that it connotes a strangeness, a weirdness, something outside the norm. He said it’s not about superiority, but it is about having a thoughtful critique and refusal of all forms of domination or superiority, something many in the U.S. have inherited because the “imperialism in our psychologies,” as residents of the dominant imperial superpower on this globe since WWII.   Along similar lines of critique, Luz emphasized that “queer identity and resistance to me was more, it had a purpose” and that it’s not just about “queering things” or “opening questions...and it’s not a theory” but that it is expressly political to her; she states that it is “liberation from heteropatriarchy and capitalism” and that she only uses it as a convenient identifying shorthand for people in the urban Bay Area because it is often a conversation ender. “I use it to describe myself not because I have a specific idea of what I want someone else to think it means” but because it connects to her commitments to individual privacy regarding dating and sexual practices, the genders of her partners, and her political activity.    127 Luz has experienced a multitude of assumptions about her – regarding gender, queerness, race, and language ability – noting that sometimes she is perceived as queer, sometimes not, and that it is not based on shifting embodiment or self-fashioning, but rather, it’s based on the different contexts and how queerness is understood across them. She noted that the structure of queerness in the urban Bay Area is “super normative and there’s a hierarchy in terms of being enough,” providing a powerful critique of specific forms of queer visibility that emerge in specific cultural or regional contexts, going on to say that “where I’m from, there weren’t enough of us” to have specific identity-based gatherings. In smaller rural or suburban communities, queers of all stripes had to be kind and patient with difference. Luz’s critique of urban “disposability” is juxtaposed with how in isolated places, many people cling to unhealthy relationships, and her analysis is not that one is better than the other, but that these differences speak to different relational, social, and political possibilities for queer folks across place.  Participating in indigenous and working-class communities and cultural life have also shaped Luz’s senses of gender norms:  The [hula] school where I trained is known for being innovative and non-traditional and one of the main ways that they are considered non-traditional is that women are allowed to do men’s dances and those dances are much more bombastic and aggressive. They’re very warrior-ish. A lot of these dances, people would say are very masculine and a lot of people have feelings about that but to me there was nothing about what we were doing that actually fell outside the realm of woman stuff and I think I’ve just always been around very physical and tough women, not just with hula, but with Tule River [Indian Reservation] stuff. Women are always   128 just tough and doing men’s work. To me, women was always a category that was much more pliable and expansive, but that might also be why this whole queer thing just never felt like a big deal for me because I was doing what to many people seemed very controversial but I thought it was controversial from a traditional-versus-non-traditional level, but probably it was equally as controversial for the gender-bending stuff that was going on. Experiences of a multiplicity of interpretations was present not just for the participants of color in this research project; they were also present regarding gender for the white trans/genderqueer educators. Harper spoke about his experience having a body that was often interpreted androgynous, as did STS. Harper noted that “all different contexts have ideas about what “normal” is” and that the way he thinks about queerness is that it “is some kind of defiance of what’s held as normal,” and that how normativity is conceived is often so contextual, and specifically referenced gender norms, heterosexual norms, institutional norms, racial norms, and ability norms. He is intellectually and politically invested in examining dominant ideologies as they manifest in school and curriculum, particularly U.S. nationalism. He is immensely critical of the monocultural domination of U.S. whiteness in constructing ideas of gender and sexual normativity. Consonant with Harper, STS focused on their experiences of having their body read as a woman, as androgynous, as male, as queer, and as straight. They understand themself to be in a “liminal position” and that they “don’t feel seen” by others. Because of their experiences of clinical violence, even their self-perception is multiple, in that they see themself as immensely valuable as a political being, as an educator, as a mentor and colleague, while also still viewing themself as “ugly” or a “monster” or “mannish,”   129 evidencing an internal dialogue of self that has absorbed many of the abuses they absorbed as a child. “It originates in the clinic,” they told me, “having to be whatever anybody wanted me to be.” That fractured, multiple sense of self has to be addressed in the present-day, notably through healing work and sobriety, which requires practices of holism and reintegration of self. STS has stated that the self-integration through sobriety from alcohol and narcotics also shapes their integrated politics, which requires space for complexity and multiplicity in order to maintain a holism. STS insists on an awareness of difference, and their academic and political work places notions of difference in historical and political context, focusing on our multiple positionalities as we move through social space.  These perspectives of embracing multiplicity and refusing homogeneity come from the research participants’ experiences with being interpreted and treated diversely across contexts and across time. These experiences – and the perspectives that has developed from them – evidence commitments to different ways of thinking and being. Queer-Decolonial Educators see immense value in questioning homogeneous representations of difference, and understand that people relate to identity terms and practices in a multitude of ways across culture and generation, leading them to relate to identity in creative and strategic ways that defy simplistic definitions. Identity, in this sense, becomes more about life practice than about a rigid relationship to language and self-representation. Critiques of normativity are deeply embedded within these refusals of homogeneity within culture and language, and such multiplicity is seen as a political queerness and sense of responsibility. This sense of responsibility materializes as a hospitality towards the difference in themselves, and in others, and as a dismantling of   130 the systems of colonialism, imperialism, capitalism, as well as the monocultural domination that comes with those disciplinary forces and institutions.  Responsibility to Legacy and Others Alongside refusals of capitalist and colonialist ways of knowing and being, this collection of Queer-Decolonial Educators has embraced cultural reclamation, revival, and immersion, which includes ancestral or indigenous lifeways or perspectives – including healing and spiritual practices. Part of this work involves reckoning with the privileges and pain that have come with intergenerational survival and assimilation. Rather than simplistically refusing privilege, they make creative use of it in order to enact a responsibility to legacy and others in ways that simultaneously destabilize the institutions, ideologies, and identities that maintain domination and oppression. The Queer-Decolonial Educators who participated in this research have demonstrated clear commitments to ancestors and to current and future generations; many explicitly articulated a concerted effort to destabilize the androcentrism of Western thought that places man atop the hierarchy of all living beings.  Research participants take a more holistic perspective of solidarity, seeing themselves as only one form of being among many non-human relations. Investigating the underpinnings of Western androcentrism has required that the Queer-Decolonial Educators I interviewed delve deeply into history, particularly legacies of institutional violence against the people from whom they are descended, as well as people with whom they choose to stand in solidarity. Reckoning with privilege and pain in society – and as educators – pushes a reimagining of near-constant learning and self-transformation as a lifeway and as a form of participation in a world of multiplicities. Their commitments to   131 being attentive to difference and diverse learners show up through intergenerational humility, recognition of land and place, and exploring the challenges of politics-as-practice.  Harper’s legacy as a settler-descended person on native land has urged him to think about questions of displacement and colonization. In his politics and scholarship, he cites a sense of indebtedness to indigenous feminisms, and the “idea of refusal, of not consenting to a system” of domination or oppression by resisting participation in thoughtful and strategic ways. Harper’s scholarly work has focused on the teaching of colonial narratives in elementary education as a part of indoctrinating youth into U.S. nation-state subjectivities. His unpaid advocacy and horizontal organizing with other trans educators, particularly trans educators of color, speak to his commitments to using the privileges he walks with to create opportunities for others who may not have the kinds of institutional access he does.  Harper maintains a strong sense of suspicion when people come into new contexts thinking they know what others in that space need; he wants to explore differences and learn from others before making any assumptions about them. Because a lot of his work involves challenging white educators-in-training to reflect on the imperatives of whiteness, Harper must often confront deep feelings on both emotional and intellectual levels – particularly, shame and guilt for having such close associations with problematic ways of thinking about and moving through the world: “I think there is a way I have experienced whiteness as often being in search of pathology...if we just find the wrong thing and try to fix it then the problem will be solved.” This reflection on the quick-fix mindset is more focused on assuaging the guilt or shame of white people than taking the   132 time required for white educators (who in California will likely work in classrooms with a majority of students of color) to learn more from their students over time and build relationships that allow for mutual learning across age and authority.  “I’m trying to be coming from a place of humility, a strong humility,” Harper shared with me. He likes to say “I don’t know, and maybe you don’t either,” in an act of refusing white, adult authority that is often placed on him institutionally, as a male-presenting trans person. He notes that waiting and listening are not things that are commonly associated with whiteness and it’s not that he is trying to build a “new whiteness” but that he is trying to resist and refuse it wherever he can, while also knowing that it is a system that operates “outside of my control.” Harper is often turning over the ethics of how and when to assert himself for safety versus when are those assertions harming others; because of his experience as a trans person, and the denial of his sense of reality that has come with it, navigating those questions of safety require a lot of careful, individual reflection so he isn’t operating from a reactive place. “Whiteness is notoriously inflexible and awkward,” Harper noted. He went on to say that flexibility isn’t easy to teach to white educators, but that it is part of what is at the root of his work, and luckily, he has been heartened by what a lot of white folks are able to put down when they realize how unrealistic it is to attempt to have absolute control over a space. When given the opportunity to reflect and learn other strategies – as well as the liberatory rationalities behind them – many are content to relax into more complex relational dynamics in their lives and teaching. Harper’s experience on the receiving end of harm, while injustices in and of themselves, have also positioned him to have the   133 perspective to deeply reflect on the ways dynamics of race show up in the politics of teaching, learning, and pedagogy more broadly. STS, in consonance with Harper, said that “my entire life, I’ve always been conscious of race and always worked against my own whiteness in particular,” highlighting that often, pieces of that whiteness were not even visible to them, and they are immensely grateful to elders, to many women of color, particularly indigenous and native women, who reached out to them in their twenties to help bring them into a consciousness around their responsibilities to use privilege wisely. STS notes the long and painful process of reckoning with privilege, which sometimes looks more graceful, and sometimes not; sitting with one’s own discomfort is an important facet of transformative learning. Today, part of those uncomfortable explorations has involved revisiting the whitening of Irish people in the United States, and participates in a group of Bay Area Irish folks who support the Ohlone, and this work includes “reclaiming some of our own identities around Irishness and tribalness and being island people,” rather than drawing upon indigeneity in appropriative ways.  STS has looked to Irish culture – and the legacy of resistance to British colonization – in order to reclaim linguistic and other practices, though they are still in search of concepts from Ireland that approximate Native American two-spirit roles, as STS’s sense of self as a non-binary person is an important feature of identity, life practice, and politics. They also made sure to clarify that their solidarity work is not about pity or about seeing that work as exclusively about others – STS insists that it’s about something much more personal. “I have skin in the game,” as someone who has also been harmed by the gender- and sexuality-regulating norms of white, middle class   134 cultural spaces. STS also feels a “responsibility to youth and the future” and draws on the Native American (Iroquois) Seventh Generation Principle that says that everything we do should be thought about in terms of how it will affect those seven generations into the future. It also implies that we ought to be thinking about the approach of those seven generations before us, because their efforts have made our lives today possible.  STS’s sense of responsibility to others is also connected to their sense of responsibility to themselves, as someone who has been in recovery from alcohol addiction for roughly thirty years. They emphasized the ways that Alcoholics Anonymous and working through addiction recovery urges participants to really resist compartmentalizing themselves into discrete parts or personalities. Because of this integration, or holism, STS has an ethical commitment to live their politics every day with a sense of integrity, which includes making their white body visible, painful as that may be due to their hypervisibility as an androgynous person. They use this practice of making whiteness visible to point to the way whiteness is often made invisible. Like Harper, STS destabilizes the authoritative tone of whiteness by maintaining the stance of a perpetual learner, which includes challenging moments of unlearning dynamics of domination; “We are all complicit,” STS insisted, and draws upon this inevitable complicity to inform a perpetual responsibility to continually rethink the all-too-often unthought.  The theme of the Seventh Generation emerged in the interview with JM as well; he feels a sense of responsibility to young queer and trans folks and works to help them “find their own self-agency or healing,” similar to how his grandmother encouraged him to discover his own sense of agency as a young person. JM’s work focuses explicitly on   135 healing from queer- and transphobia and draws upon traditional Filipinx medicine work. He studies Filipinx herbalism and is a Teaching Assistant in a community class, which incorporates a ceremonial flow. He says his work is all about “intergenerational healing, learning about your ancestral, culturally-specific plants” which were often specific to each tribal group or province, and that he works with plants to help create medicine not just to take medicine as individuals, but to participate in healing “parts of our DNA that we don’t even known about.” Because he works primarily with youth, JM is insistent on reflecting on the way adultism shows up in his support group/healing circles with youth, and brings a politic of engaging diversity through different modalities of engagement, including using writing exercises as tools for reflection. He often reflects on capitalist culture and how that shapes our relations to time and taking the requisite space to learn from difference. He believes strongly that learning to be in community with others is an essential practice of healing individual and intergenerational trauma.  Addressing intergenerational trauma through land-based practices was foundational to Desi’s practices of responsibility to her own legacy, and to the legacies of others. She spoke about land-based trauma for African diaspora folks living in the United States, and that slavery has shaped the ways that many rural black folks in the South – including her family – view farm labor. These reflections and her land-based work have brought her into contact and collaboration with Native American folks who have been able to maintain and reclaim many indigenous practices. Desi has learned the importance of de-centering humans in queer ecojustice work, given that we are but only one species of being on this planet. It is important for her to see kinship with nature and the interconnection of all beings, which requires each person to develop an intimate   136 connection to land and place as one of the most transformative pathways to a sense of belonging, something she has often struggled with growing up far away from her large extended family that has been in rural Louisiana for many generations. Learning about ancestral food-ways from Native peers has encouraged her to explore her own ancestral practices, and her connection to the African diaspora in the Americas. Desi insists that her responsibilities through a sense of queerness involve a life-long commitment to “cultural and biological diversity.” Drawing upon similar understandings, Fredrick insists that intellectual and spiritual training must go hand-in-hand. Trained in Zen Buddhism and Social and Cultural Anthropology, he sees the resonance across different practices of human freedom as necessarily embedded in larger ecologies. From such diverse training, as well as from his experience growing up with his parents, Fredrick has developed an immense respect for and practice of oral history and storytelling. He sees himself as indebted to these legacies, as well as to his legacy as a U.S. American, noting that we are often “disconnected from history...even our own ancestry” and that the whole project of the U.S. is “being an individual that works towards the future,” thereby complicating efforts to be mindful of both individual and cultural legacies of harm, both as victimized and perpetrating peoples.  Because of his mixed ancestry – and the mixed ancestry of both his parents – Fredrick sees himself in relation to the many mixed children that were aborted or stolen, to indigenous peoples, to black bodies everywhere, but not in a reductive perspective of “sameness”; rather, he means that he has a sense of responsibility because we are knitted together through the tangled webs of history and institutions. He also doesn’t see his   137 indebtedness to legacy being one exclusively of conscious personal choice – he has had dreams of Native American (Cherokee) ancestors coming to him and letting it be known that he has a role to play in cultural survival and reclamation and these dreams have left him with a “tremendous sense of responsibility.” This responsibility often looks like an attentiveness to different generational learning styles and strengths across time, and especially notes the shorter and shorter attention spans present in contemporary life, working to tell stories more succinctly. More immediately, Fredrick has deep respect for the Stonewall participants and generation who did so much for young people today: “People don’t understand how much they did and how much they withstood.” He has a commitment to ongoing learning and refuses narratives that suggest adults and elders ever fully arrive at an end point of personal development. He also resonates with other Queer-Decolonial Educators I interviewed in his perspectives that ecojustice must necessarily be a part of any liberatory politic: “Humans are doing violence to mother earth and animals” though he finds it incredibly difficult to talk about ecology because most people are hardly equipped to even discuss issues such as race, so he tries to bring in pieces about ecology but he doesn’t see it going very successfully most of the time.  He notes how important it is that questions of culture, genocide, and ecocide go hand-in-hand, largely because of indigenous peoples and ancestors here in the United States. He believes these interconnections are often dismissed by the U.S. public more broadly. In order to refuse complicity with such dismissive attitudes, Fredrick practices deep reflection on himself, insisting that “spirituality is not something that is an idea, it’s something I live...spirituality is the commitment” to the work of justice. From this, he has   138 taken on the responsibility to work through his own shyness and become a powerful public orator, and that people usually dismiss his hard work as innate talent, and he reflects on such dismissals as a desire for U.S. Americans to dominate narratives of reality. He feels a sense of responsibility to himself, his parents, and his ancestors all over the globe and cosmos, to reflect on what he calls “the American imperial psyche” and our drives to dominate everyone and everything.  Luz’s life exemplifies the responsibility and commitment to exploring the reality and challenges of living one’s beliefs. She articulated a responsibility to learn about social issues, and the histories and institutions that produce and perpetuate them, because the people often experiencing the harshest consequences do not have the time, resources, or educational privilege to do so. Her life demonstrates a place-embedded sense of responsibility to urgent local needs, including the impacts of environmental racism in Modesto and harm reduction support for people living (and dying) with addictions. She notes that the privileges of her life she has enjoyed have come at the direct cost to other communities and people. Because of this reality, she refuses the word solidarity, offering the reflection that “it’s more just doing what’s right...you know about something happening and by virtue of being a citizen and having an education you can do something.” She believes solidarity has been popularized as a term to help middle class and non-profit professionals not confuse their work with charity work.  Immersion in indigenous cultural practice for the majority of her life shapes Luz’s sense of ethics and responsibility. She has danced hula since early childhood, and describes the art-form as dances that represent Hawai’ian oral history, and that because of this oral tradition, “it’s taken very seriously as a physical record of a people’s history who   139 didn’t have a written language” and that to some, dancing hula may be a hobby, but to her and to many, it is a life-way. She has also connected with her Yaqui ancestry, which has been formative to her knowledge of legacies of displacement, which led her to working with Palestinian scholars and student. “There’s something in me that knows what displacement feels like...and it’s not because I’ve lived it in this lifetime,” she detailed to me during our interview. She went on to say, “[Displacement] is in me” and she resonates with “a fraction of that pain and the rage and helplessness” because “we’re not that far removed, so hearing about Palestine strikes a chord for a lot of Native folks here.” Refusals to assimilate into dominant U.S. culture saturate Luz’s politics and inform her perspectives of intergenerational disconnect, and the responsibilities of teaching and reconnection across generation and life experience. She sees her role as an educator as her responsibility to participate in strategies for social change, reflecting that “teaching is one of the early stages in addressing a problem.” She sees a lot of her ethical reflection as connecting to holding the tension of wanting students to reckon with ignorance and privilege, while challenging her own desires to control what that process looks like, always remembering it’s not her responsibility to follow them into their private mental space. This work of deep reflection is immensely spiritual as well, noting that “our job is to become a vessel for something positive or divine to work through us. For now, my vessel has a really powerful brain so I should use that to help people where I’m from.” When working with students, she sees how important it is that her own understandings are rooted in the responsibility to know history, to “genealogize”   140 concepts, like gender, so that people can see that they aren’t given, natural, or inevitable. Luz, along with the other Queer-Decolonial Educators, has found ways to draw upon a deep sense of ethics and responsibility to weave together the privilege and pain of their own individual experience. These educators see their experience as embedded in cultural legacies and they acknowledge a need to re-immerse themselves in life practices of history, strategic storytelling, indebtedness to ancestors and future generations, and work to shape political commitments that include ongoing learning and teaching as strategies within the work of justice.                   141 PART V: POLITICS INFORMING PEDAGOGY  In the previous chapter, we explored the ways that queer-decolonial educators’ politics are shaped in intimate relationship with individual and intergenerational life experiences. From these experiences, these educators understand that culture, language, power, and history must necessarily be actively engaged through processes of transmitting knowledge and skills within the context of pedagogical praxis. These experiences and politics are essential facets of queer-decolonial pedagogies that seek to engage multiple forms of difference to intervene on queerphobia, transphobia, and coloniality.  Question 2: For Queer-Decolonial Educators, how have resistance and solidarity politics informed approaches to pedagogy in formal and informal learning contexts? Linking Politics to Pedagogy  Drawing upon complex life experience, queer-decolonial educators craft a political outlook that necessarily includes thoughtful resistance, commitments to contributing to cultural and biological diversity, and an awareness of the ways that normalizing institutions – including schools – can refuse to recognize just how important it is to affirm multiplicities of identity and experience. Additionally, these educators focus not just on the needs of the present moment, but are looking into the past for context and inspiration, as well as to the future, to contribute to a justice that is visible, yet often far off on the horizon.   Queer-decolonial educators report that the political frameworks they draw upon are holistically infused across their life practices, and are present in their pedagogical practices in both formal and informal education. From their own experiences, they claim   142 to maintain an acute awareness of differences in culture, language use and access, diverse modes of acquiring knowledge and wisdom, and the urgent importance of linking issues of justice. These perspectives show up in spaces of learning in ways that have transformative potential; queer-decolonial educators report being incredibly proficient at multimodal learning, and often value structure-before-content, noting that the context and strategies used to engage learners often bears greater relevance than the topics or information discussed – people absorb so much from the rhythmic, ceremonial, spatial, and collaborative elements of learning experiences.  Additionally, queer-decolonial educators insist on intersectionality as a political strategy of solidarity and coalition building, and they understand that such an integrated approach requires that both educators and students work from a place of holism. Immersed in history, politics, and strategic resistance, their work, as described by them, destabilizes notions of authority and hierarchy in spaces of learning. Through this immersion, queer-decolonial educators assume a role that is a hybrid of leader and follower, what might be called a “host-guest” role that is infused with a near-sacred hospitality towards the difference that appears before them (and at times, explicitly sacred, for those drawing upon spiritual traditions in their conceptions of commitment and responsibility).  Multimodality: Structure-before-Content  The educators interviewed for this research project touched on an array of themes within the overarching frame of multimodality: rhythm and relations to time, diverse forms of engagement (experiential, kinesthetic, land-based, discussion, talking circles, arts-based, introspection and reflection, and storytelling), as well as the different levels of   143 freedom to experiment across formal and informal educational contexts. Not surprisingly, many who engage in more informal education spoke to higher levels of freedom, and those who teach across both contexts highlighted a greater sense of freedom in informal contexts. The following reflections point to opportunities for enriching learning experiences through diverse modes of engagement.  “I was a really reluctant educator,” Harper confessed to me during our interview. “I hated teachers. I hated school. I never wanted to be an educator...I came into education more by way of community organizing projects.” He had it in his mind that “teachers are people who try to control kids” and that he “wanted to try to do what [he] could to resist arbitrarily controlling kids.” As an Early Childhood Education specialist, Harper is well-aware of the need to engage young students in a multimodal approach, simply as a way to provide developmentally-appropriate opportunities for them to engage with the ideas he thinks are important for them to consider. Some of these ideas include conversations about race, gender, class, and more.  Harper described feeling most free in informal education, where there are no learning outcomes, no evaluation. From this experience, he reported learning how to bring that freedom into spaces of formal education. His preferred mode of engagement is dramatic play with some of the youngest students: “I think there’s just really deep, deep work to be done there and that’s really fun.” He recalled a moment where he observed two young white boys taking turns playing police officers and criminals, the one locking up the other in a prison they had built out of blocks. Harper views dramatic play as an opportunity to stage “interventions on a reenactment of the world” and that moments like this can be used as a springboard for a class discussion, where as a teacher, he might   144 describe what he observed, and start asking the students reflective questions and to imagine alternative possibilities.  With his Teacher Education students, Harper insists that they are equipped to discuss issues of violence with young students. In Teacher Education courses, he described showing a video of young children in New York City after 9/11 – some of whom had lost parents in the attacks – and in the video, there is footage of kids building the Twin Towers and knocking them down over and over, as a part of their process of dealing with the trauma. Linking students’ dramatic play to adult-world conversations that were happening at the time was described as an important invention within a context where students’ experiences with real-world political and social events and catastrophes are often dismissed.  Harper, in reflecting on the power of dramatic play, said “that’s where all the stuff comes out about race, class gender, ability” and that students “talk about it, they act it out, much more freely” and that engaging with youth more as a peer who is playing along with them, he believes “you get a lot more leverage than if you were didactic about it.” While to many, not having clear learning outcomes might feel anxiogenic, Harper’s improvisational tactics require a specialized view of dramatic play as suffused with opportunities to pull out the often-unspoken dynamics that are present, but not given language. His approach names these dynamics and uses imaginative play to reenact other possibilities with young students. He laments that “so much gets imposed on teachers and kids in schools...I have to stick to the syllabus,” and even though he sees value in syllabi – particularly because so much effort and so many resources are often invested in education and its outcomes – Harper thinks that:   145 So much of schooling is organized in a way that is very robotic. And scripted. And that’s what a lot of curriculum does...I read textbooks, I read a lot of lesson plans, and curriculum guides that teachers are given for the purpose of efficiency and it’s a snooze-fest.  STS began by saying, “I hated school. My friends and family always laugh that I’m a professor now.” They believe that’s a large part of why they are much more engaging with students than many of their teachers were; STS prefers lectures, discussions, and workshops because, as they claimed, “I’m a storyteller, I’m oral. You ask me a question” and in responding, “that’s how I paint.” STS illustrated an exercise they introduce in the beginning of class where they stand up at the front of room have students describe them, asking “What do I look like?” as a way to emphasize visual observation skills and the importance of unpacking our ways of seeing others. “I’m visual, so I show film, I use YouTube. It’s the whole texting generation...short everything.” In this way, STS literally brings embodied teaching and learning into the classroom, using their body as a canvas for painting historical and political critique. “I put on whiteness and I don’t take it off,” making the structural and institutional invisibility of dominance ever-present in their work, and also forcing a recognition of educators as not merely automatons of authority, but bodies with life, with race, with gender, and with politics.  Combining visual and verbal learning in this way, STS described a pedagogy full of orality or storytelling similar to Fredrick’s approach of layering stories with multiple planes of meaning and critique. The latter shared that one approach is where “you present a paragraph or a story but it’s layered with questions that are ready to unpack.” Fredrick,   146 who generally serves as an educator in informal, public contexts, often reads sections or whole chapters from his book, transforming written texts into oral texts. This approach allows him to engage directory with listeners and learners, because he is there for their immediate response to his writing, and can engage questions and points of contention. He insists that this approach is about engaging people not just intellectually, but spiritually as well, and that the two are not mutually exclusive: Usually, you can do that by getting at an assumption they’ve had but you don’t know what assumptions they’ve had, you’re trying to be present, I’m trying to pick stories that present certain dynamics and then hoping that people will be questioning things in the stories. He reported enjoying the question-and-answer format for public panels and presentations of his work on the Black Pacific, drawing upon his experience and cultural legacies as “Black-Japanese Amerasian,” which he has illustrated as an experience infused with intergenerational learning, including spiritual teachings. He uses his intellect and intuition to gain a sense of how much people can handle: “I think you can’t cover all the bases with people, they can’t handle all the information” and then can feel like “they’re being attacked.” Fredrick shared that he often finds it difficult to bring too much complexity to public speaking audiences and that when participants are overwhelmed, they can become hostile. He makes efforts towards clarity and succinctness, and like STS, names generational attention spans as a reality he has had to navigate. He prefers storytelling and question-and-answer to unidirectional lectures.  JM narrated that his approach to pedagogy challenges models of teaching and learning that view artistic practice as separate from other subject matter; he has his own   147 writing and art practices that he brings into support groups he runs with queer and trans middle school students. Because of his own experiences growing up and struggling in schools, he described remaining ever-attentive to introversion and other forms of neurodivergence. He shared his belief that arts-based pedagogies provide opportunities for diverse learners to participate in meaningful ways: “How do we hold space for different learning styles and practice different modalities in our teaching spaces?” JM provides many answers to his own questions.  In describing his support groups, he emphasized the use arts-based check-in activities, including encouraging youth to create collages using magazines and other supplies to respond to questions like, “How does your gender feel today?” While this question may seem to foreground gender as the topic of content, students are not asked to share verbally or in writing, but instead to use the mode of artistic creation as a way to encourage sharing and engagement through non-verbal means; explicit, verbal sharing about an individual sense of gender can often be difficult, if not impossible, for many youth. After students take some time to create a collage, he insists on a moment of pause, where all participants walk around a table where all the collages are laid out so they can soak in the creations made by other folks in the group. He notices that these practices have produced small – yet noticeable – shifts in student confidence. JM has been writing curriculum for middle school support groups for “queer, trans, questioning, and gender non-conforming” students for a few years, and recalls that: When I first started, we were doing classes called leadership classes that focused on teaching intersectionality curriculum to sixth to eighth graders in the school   148 district...my experience of that was a joke...the structures that we create to implement learning really matter. And the content comes second. When asked to elaborate on what he meant by the importance of structure-before content, JM emphasized the importance of “small-group learning environments,” especially when bringing up topics that may be particularly sensitive for students. He says he is a “big advocate for small learning environments that center the student first” and that additionally “center community building before the content even starts,” demonstrating the importance of building trust between educators and learners, as well as across learners. It is difficult to learn about difficult content when there isn’t trust to forge forward with supportive peers and educators who are willing to co-create a community of respect.  JM insists that slowing down and introducing elements of rhythm and ceremony in learning spaces is important, particularly around opening students up in the beginning while also closing them up at the end to ensure emotional safety, particularly when discussing experiences of homophobia and transphobia with students of color. He draws upon his experience with plant healing ceremonies to create rhythms that communicate shifts in focus to students: “Ok, Jamil is lighting the candle, that means we’re going to be introspective now.” He believes that “doing simple moments of pause” when you know there is a “teachable moment” rather than “centering the curriculum over the needs of the group” is an essential part of pedagogies that support students bringing their whole selves into spaces of learning, particularly when those selves have been exposed to multiple forms of harm or violence. While much curricula in formal and informal education is   149 attentive to student needs, JM has found that a lot of curricula focused on queer and trans youth is not attentive to student needs.   As serious as some of his work is, JM also notes the distinction between clinical therapy and spaces of learning that can have therapeutic effects. He resists the former while making great efforts to lean into practices that support the latter; balancing gravity with levity is a pursuit of his. “If you bring something intensely introspective” then it’s important that you “balance it with laughter” otherwise it can “turn into a therapy session, and that’s not the kind of space we want to create.” JM notes the importance of sitting in a circle, which is another practice he has translated from his time as a teaching assistant to a practitioner of Filipino Traditional Medicine, where he is familiar with watching others use plant medicines to heal themselves. Participating in traditional ceremonies has encouraged him to bring the structure of these teachings to create “mini-ceremonies” within his support group structures.   Desi’s approach to pedagogy infuses many of the elements described by the other participants in this research. One of her favorite teaching experiences was when she designed a peer-led, intersectional course designed by students, for students when she was pursuing her graduate education. As a part of the Queer Ecojustice Project, Desi worked to bring together queer politics and ecojustice frameworks, two terrains that aren’t often addressed simultaneously in mainstream classrooms or disciplines. She used the book “Crimes Against Nature,” a book created for kids that is a “retelling of what’s natural,” in her words. She says the book provides important interventions because biology and nature are often used to construct our ideas of what is natural, and that in her estimation, “nature is hella gay.” She used the example of avocado trees, and the ways   150 that avocado flowers change sex (or, the kinds of sex cells they produce for purposes of pollination) by day and by night.  Using examples from nature to denaturalize exclusivist frames of binary gender and heterosexuality has been a fruitful endeavor for Desi. She described using this work as a launching pad to pursue work with Movement Generation, an education-focused and movement-building organization that uses experiential and land-based learning to bring different professionals together across the justice-work spectrum to see the links across their issues. When holding workshops or trainings, a lot of the work is outdoor, land-based learning, where learners spend time outside actually observing the phenomena they are being taught about. Desi has also engaged in this type of experiential learning when she hosted “farm walks” during her time at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, a working organic farm and learning center at the University of California at Santa Cruz. The program she was in focused on class learning and farm learning, and information and questions were posted amidst produce and flowers growing on the farm.  One of these questions was “How does your back feel picking strawberries?” where kinesthetic experiences of bending over to pick the delicate fruit was used as an opening to think about issues of farmworker justice. Desi finds people open up to reflection differently when learning involves their bodies and direct observation through multiple senses. She has continued with this work in Movement Generation, where she hosts “observation walks” that involve self-reflection on place, using land itself as a pedagogical tool. She wants folks involved in justice movements to avoid “easeful denialism” about their imbrication in the urban alienation from life processes. She believes these kinds of learning “walks” help people to feel “grounded in reality” when   151 discussing complex and layered issues. This kind of learning and teaching has felt most freeing to her.   Such “easeful denialism” is all-too-present in Luz’s undergraduate students, and she described drawing upon her community organizing experience as an explicit foundation for pedagogy, which helps her work with students to reimagine political possibilities for their present and future worlds. Through discussion and small group work in a formal classroom setting, Luz sees her teaching as a political act. Alongside her frustrations with the structure of college semesters – which she sees as far too short and mainly facilitative of understanding and interpreting texts – she also knows that she has to “capture their attention, and in order to capture their attention, I have to be entertaining” but that she’s “not a dog and pony show” despite feeling like at times, she has to be attention-grabbing. “I think the hardest part is swimming against the current of disengagement,” she articulates, highlighting the fight against social and political alienation and apathy. She uses film, readings, group projects, and more, often coming up against limitations in students’ willingness to try innovative pedagogical approaches. Her quick wit and sense of humor aid in creating a feeling of entertained engagement for students.   Queer-decolonial educators report drawing upon the tensions between gravity and levity, their ability to use visual and kinesthetic forms of engagement and play, as well as innovative uses of storytelling and discussion to create structures of learning that create opportunities for a holistic relationship to life experience, learning, politics, and multiplicity and difference. Such approaches emphasize how the diversity of our structures of learning must mirror the multiplicity of the content they wish to convey;   152 often this content itself is immensely intersectional, and such intersectionality is a powerful approach to demonstrating the power of education as social and political strategies for fostering worlds of justice for many forms of difference.    Intersectionality: Education as Political Strategy  For queer-decolonial educators, intersectionality is fundamentally about creating space for a holistic approach to teaching and learning about complex life experiences, history, and politics. This work of pedagogy requires an integrated, interdisciplinary, multimodal immersion, as an experiment in solidarity and alliance-building across difference. Educational experiences, in the view of such educators, is a key part in social and political change, designed to be transformative from the very root of their conception. Because of how their lives and cultural legacies have not allowed them to compartmentalize identities, experiences, and intellectual frameworks of thought and action, they report developing strategies for confronting material in a way that allows for multiplicity – their students and their own – to remain fully integrated.   Along these lines, Fredrick insists that “the main thing is to make everything multiple” in his public storytelling and oral history work. He went on to say “everything is not just one thing” and that it’s also “not just about one that, but it’s also constructed” and that the construction of concepts and ideas happen “in relations of power.” From this perspective, Fredrick critiques how his work is often interpreted as being primarily about race, as a mixed-race and bi-cultural person. He wonders what cultural influences shape how his work is received, and he uses excerpts from his took to tell stories that are layered with questions and that at a certain point you “just have to leave it to the readers” to make whatever sense of it they will. He knows that his influence and careful crafting   153 of a story can only go so far, and that interpretation – as well as his own representations of himself – are also inevitably multiple.   One strategy Fredrick employs in his public pedagogy is “naming some of the things and then having the audience understand the overlapping issues.” He accomplishes this by “get[ting] to one or two of the layers [of a story] that kind of tweak and disturb them.” Fredrick draws upon his Zen training in his pedagogy, where multiplicity, contrariness, and abrupt interventions are seen as useful tools for disturbing settled assumptions. Elaborating, he went on to say that “you’re trying to perform the commitment because a commitment is really not about me being accepted...I have a commitment to my ancestors. I have a commitment to ecology...it’s connected.” Fredrick took this moment to elaborate more concretely; he talked about how attendees of his public talks may be coming looking to hear about mixed-race identities, but that because of his intersectional commitments, he creates opportunities to bring up the sewage pollution in Okinawa when he was growing up there. The sewage pollution came from the U.S. military bases, and in such a storytelling maneuver, he is able to link mixed-race identity to bi-cultural experience, which brings in discussions on military occupation and its disastrous ecological consequences. Race, culture, critiques of militarism, and environmental imperialism are united in Fredrick’s accounting of his experience and pedagogy.   Harper’s work, from a very different standpoint, insists on a similar critique as Fredrick narrated; he emphasized that “a lot of my work has been about questioning the nationalist narrative of U.S. history” and “gender in children’s lives and schools.” He said that people understand him more when he is talking about queer and trans youth and the   154 issues they face, but they often struggle to see “how that connects to thinking about nationalist ideologies,” and so it is his task to help them understand the ways that nationalism has shaped certain ideals about what it means to be a good citizen, which in the U.S., includes notions of binary gender and heterosexuality.  Harper often uses gender and sexuality studies as a way to invite people into discussions about colonialism and capitalism, understanding that those realms are inextricably bound up with one another. He notes that “there are gendered ways of being all over the world that fall outside a binary,” recalling his time spent in South Africa. His work in Early Childhood Education, elaborated above, thrives on the aleatory nature of dramatic play, where layered dynamics of whiteness, age, gender, and authority emerge organically. Harper relishes in those opportunities to engage real-life with an intersectional lens with youth, and draws upon that knowledge to address those same dynamics with his teachers-in-training.  Crafting pedagogy to intervene on disciplinary blind-spots is a specialty of STS’s, as a white, queer, androgynous person who has committed themself to a life of anti-racist and anti-colonial politics. “My undergrad is in Ethnic Studies, my Master’s is in Sociology, and my Doctorate is in Philosophy with an emphasis in Social and Cultural Anthropology,” STS told me, continuing on to say “I’m a mutt, to say the least...I’m not so disciplined. It’s intersectional, like my life.” When asked to reflect on why they insist on that kind of holistic approach, STS said, “I feel [it’s] my recovery [from alcohol addiction], which has me synthesized as a whole person. I’m not compartmentalized...I live my politic.” Elaborating on the classroom activity briefly described above, STS described an early-semester activity where they stand in front of the room and ask the   155 students to describe what they see, partly as a practice of making their whiteness visible, but also having students deliberately put on their interpretive lenses, and to observe that the ways other see might be incredibly different from theirs. Using their own body as a layered text opens up a discussion STS segues into regarding how we are all interpreting multiple identities simultaneously.  STS’s said that the use of visual multimedia, like YouTube videos and documentary films, provides students with opportunities to confront what they see “in its totality,” because with reading, they say “we can often choose to imagine a scene.”  Using visual teaching tools, it becomes necessary to engage what we see more holistically, making students unable to ignore the impacts of race, class, gender, sexuality, nation, age, and more, on how they interpret the words and actions of another. JM had a similar critique of curricular and pedagogical approaches that force discussions of intersectionality, but thinks it’s better to let those intersections come up more organically, because life is already intersectional. STS reports accomplishing this through selecting materials that lend themselves to a multiplicity of interpretation. He thinks this is a good pedagogical strategy, particularly when working with middle schoolers who may be too shy to share more directly. JM reported that his pedagogy often emphasizes the intersections of gender, race, ability/neurodiversity, age, and hierarchy. He believes such holistic approaches to education and discussion actually have healing effects: “To teach, for me, is to heal, to listen, to learn how to heal, to learn these tools. And my intention is not necessarily to heal someone else, but to heal myself.” Because he works primarily with queer and trans youth of color, he claimed he doesn’t want to center dominance in any way, particularly   156 because how we learn about authority and domination in spaces of learn carry over into other parts of our lives. In his estimation, educators who have not taken the time to heal their own relationships to authority often end up reproducing those cycles of violence. JM appreciated arts-based activities because of their ability to bring out complexly whole selves: “our liberation is bound up with each other’s and if I’m going to work for my own, it’s for the liberation and freedom of folks around me.” While it doesn’t always work out perfectly, JM notes the importance of maintaining that commitment to supporting complex voices and experiences.   Commitments to pedagogy as a strategy of political coalition building showed up in Luz’s narrative as well: “teaching is actually a good way for me to put my politics and my beliefs into practice and reach a lot of people.” She went on to say that despite her immense life experience, she doesn’t say much to her students about who she is or where she comes: “I think there might be things that are valuable for students to learn about...and yet, I’m not gonna do it.” Regardless of whether or not she explicitly shares life stories, Luz draws upon her community organizing and complex relationships to identity and culture when she crafts pedagogies of “consciousness-raising.” She believes that “having a conversation is the first step towards organizing and mass mobilization” and that these efforts require that we “get everybody on the same page and get them understanding the problem” before you can do anything to address it, which requires recognition that everybody’s coming from a different place.  Her work as a college classroom teacher also places responsibility on students to see how course topics intersect with real-life:    157 As a student, I have always seen it as my responsibility to figure out how some of the stuff I was learning about could be applicable to and helpful to struggles for justice in my community. There’s no shortage of things that need fixing in the Central Valley. Because students, in contemporary K-12 public education, are often dissuaded from seeing the connections between classrooms and their worlds, Luz notes the importance of walking students through political strategizing, using the example of strategic arrests during direct-action resistance. She described taking the time to walk students through a sequence of events to illustrate what they might expect should they decide to take direct-action, what some of those particular tactics are, and what some consequences might be, such as fines, arrest, or criminal charges. She reports reminding them of the important potential to set legal or policy precedents that could help others: Obviously, I don’t want to sign anybody up for suffering, but if you really care about this shit so much that you’re willing to make some kind of sacrifice, then do it strategically. That’s what I tell them. Don’t do it just for the sake of being a rebel or because you’re mad right now. Think long-game.  Encouraging learners to “think long-game” is precisely what Desi believes her pedagogy encourages, illuminating educational approaches that demonstrate an intersectionality of social issues alongside notions of time or temporality; what we do in the present moment intersects with possibilities for justice both now and long into the future. She lamented that “our movements are so siloed” and that the focus needs to be on naming all the harm from “extractive economies.” In particular, within the environmental justice movement, some are “talking about whales and disparate ecosystems” while   158 others are discovering “toxins and wastes” in people’s backyards, but that even within all that, folks struggle to see how these issues are connected. Desi and her work with Movement Generation labor to illuminate these links. These tensions exist even within a single disciplinary focus of environmental studies and justice, let alone across other fields that focus on race, gender, and sexuality.  Desi reports finding plant science and biology to be a valuable crux for questions of ecology, gender, sexuality, culture, and diversity. She articulated the necessity of decentering humans in our understanding of life, and that it’s important to bring together people across disciplines and professions because this pushes content to be intersectional so that it’s relevant to all and encourages establishing practice connections across issues in a holistic way. This work necessarily touches upon topics that also hit close to home: Some of the threads we’re putting together and some of the writing is kind of generally about embodiment and different forms of desire and kinship and ways of knowing...the ways that things network and come together is so different than these little bubbles, mechanical thinking [that is] like ‘here is this part and this part and they need to work together in this way’. Desi believes that intersectional pedagogy in informal learning environments, such as the queer political conference titled Creating Change, brings different topics into particular spaces. Her workshop was the only session focused on ecology at the entire Creating Change conference and through evaluations and other forms of feedback, came to learn that participants found it an exciting and generative form of engagement.   When Desi described teaching about reclaiming ecojustice work from a queer perspective, her analysis described an infusion of questions of economy and industry,   159 history, race, gender, im/migration, and diaspora, as she is critical of the “legacy of agricultural work constructed as and used as brutal work, from slavery on.” Her analysis begs questions of solidarity across those who feel empowered to reclaim “ancestral food-ways,” such as Africa’s “botanical legacy in the U.S.”, and those who have been brutalized by forced or coercive agricultural labor. Questions of class and violence inevitably become a part of conversations about sustainable ecology in Desi’s pedagogy. There are clear links described between practices of decolonization and the need to explore past and current practices of indigeneity, and she notes the immense importance of engaging indigenous people and communities in the U.S. because it isn’t just about topical representation, but about incorporating indigenous worldviews into pedagogy more broadly.   Queer-decolonial educators articulated a capacity to address topics in layered and intersectional ways, and described teaching experiences that were relevant and meaningful for learners across formal and informal learning contexts. Pedagogy often thrives under conditions of flexibility, wherein practiced educators are able to use strategic entry points through which they can draw out previously unconsidered connections to issues that may not seem immediately related, yet are. This is part of the role of the host-guest, to be elaborated upon below in greater detail. Such valuable practices of raising social, political, and historical awareness require that queer-decolonial educators approach each teaching opportunity as a moment to learn as much from their students as their students learn from them, given the collaborative approaches they take to co-constructing a critique of the status quo. These practices create opportunities previously deemed unimaginable or irrelevant.    160 The Host-Guest Role: Questions and Openness  Destabilizing the absolute authority of the teacher, through these collaborative approaches, positions queer-decolonial educators to thoughtfully intervene on dynamics of adultism, authoritarianism, racism, classism, and more. These educators report understanding the importance of interacting with the mysterious, unknown, and unpredictable nature of processes of learning, which includes questioning relationships to language. Such an approach to pedagogy requires that queer-decolonial educators learn to learn from below (Spivak, 2015) by staying open to difference and posing questions that engage multiple ways of knowing and being, demonstrating a sensitivity to cultural and cognitive differences that often are ignored or actively denigrated in classrooms or other spaces of learning. This form of pedagogy requires that educators demonstrate incredible hospitality towards difference, while also being willing to enter into learners’ worlds as visitors, positioning them as simultaneous “host-guests” and allowing them to fully live out their commitments and senses of responsibility to justice.   Open-ended questions for which there is no simple or singular correct answer is one of the most powerful tools for queer-decolonial educators. Luz offers the following question to her undergraduate students: “What if there were more than two genders?” and engages students in a discussion of the implications of this reality. She continued to reflect that “they just take it as scientific fact” and that it “cannot be debated” because they “aren’t even aware that there’s literature out there” and she finds this dynamic odd because it is increasingly likely that young people actually know someone personally who is trans or nonbinary. She uses this kind of dynamic engagement to figure out where their roadblocks are, to see what information they’re drawing upon, what information   161 they might be open to, and how to pose questions that point them towards reckoning with what they do and don’t know. This form of engagement has implications for thinking about how we can create possibilities for students to dramatically shift how they think about themselves and the world around them.   Additionally, she asks students to fundamentally question what is possible within spaces of formal education, opening the classroom itself up to critique. She reflects back to the students that “you’re out here talking about how we need to put more women of color in the syllabus” and yet, students aren’t even questioning “why are we reading? Why are we in a classroom? Why are we in a university?” She wants students to “really think about how what we take as knowledge” revolves around putting “so much stake in the written word,” demonstrating first-hand knowledge from immersion in indigenous cultural spaces that storytelling and orality are important – and often dismissed or denigrated – culturally particular and legitimate forms of knowledge. She describes efforts to enter their world as a guest to help fetter out their biases, remaining open to how learning has been for them, all the while posing new questions, and hosting a space wherein critical reflection might propel students into new depths of critical thought.   JM is posing similar questions to himself as he explores a creative relationship to pedagogy: “What are we prioritizing What does it mean to teach? To work in community across diversity?” This active and iterative process of reflecting on the efficacy of our teaching tools can help to address the needs of our most marginalized students, and it requires that educators are supported in and compensated for such labor. He continues to involve students in the process of evaluating pedagogy, through posing questions like, “Who really liked this activity? Who wants to do something different?” These simple   162 interventions disrupt the unidirectional flow of feedback that students are most accustomed to, and challenge the hierarchy of authority in a space of learning and personal growth. JM prefers participatory structures and methods to authoritative ones; even simple shifts like sitting in a circle instead of rows can dramatically change the feeling of a space, he noted. He is interested in learning from people all around him, including his students, and often asks himself, “what are the histories of the folks around me?” and makes efforts towards learning how diverse cultures can co-exist in a single setting, particularly within classrooms.   In her work with Movement Generation, Desi is focused on finding shared language, and exploring what she calls the “growing edge” in every community of activists who are focused on particular issues. The “growing edge” consists of issues that people may be aware of, but have not considered the ways those issues overlap with their concerted area of focus, such as when environmental justice advocates fail to account for issues of gender and sexuality, or when gender justice advocates struggle to see how race impacts their work. This effort to find shared language and frameworks can be challenging, particularly when issues are so charged for people.  Harper lamented that “language is so limiting,” with particular reference to his critique of the “glossary and definitions approach to Trans 101” which is the shorthand for trainings or workshops that give introductory material about gender identity and how it is different from sexual orientation. Trans 101 often consists of a one-to-two-hour workshop or training session in schools, non-profits, businesses, and other places, where educators, employees, or community members are given information designed to help people understand language and definitions about transgender people. While this can be   163 an initial step towards reducing transphobia in schools, workplaces, and communities, it is not adequate for meaningfully shifting cultures to more deeply interrogate discrimination and assumptions – these workshops also often rely on clinical terminology that is often confusing even to those with college degrees. He wishes there were more attentiveness to what Desi describes as the “growing edge” because he notices that if people don’t immediately pick up on language and definitions, they’re often dismissed as “transphobic.”  Harper went on to say that, “transness is a whole world, and how insulting is to think you could ever enter a world for an hour and come out completely understanding it?” Harper wants to invite people into the world of transness in all its diversity and complexity, and help them see that it’s more than about terms and definitions, but about fundamentally challenging norms in dominant society. He believes that such a reductive approach to teaching about gender identity is “a demoralizing, degrading idea that’s really an insult to both the world of transness and human intelligence.” Instead, he tries to enter into other people’s understandings, often asking non-trans people – also known as cis people – “what’s your gender?” as a way to invite them into self-awareness and reflection on their senses of gender as well.  Because Harper works in Teacher Education with a largely white student body – who will be going on to teach mostly students of color – he sees it as part of his role to teach them to wait, to listen, to develop a sense of patience, to refuse the performance of expertise, and to open up opportunities for exploring together. He also notes that this requires having a sensitivity towards when to push and when to not, and in essence, modeling that he doesn’t need to be “the sole arbiter of power” in his classrooms. He   164 wants teachers-in-training to absorb this, and that a lot of this means understanding the requirements of whiteness – which include control, a sense of superiority, and positioning oneself as all-knowing – as someone who is within it, but encouraging others to let that go; he notes that it feels important for white folks, especially white trans masculine folks, “to do more listening and stepping back,” as a way to refuse dominant whiteness. STS poses a similar question to their students as Harper does: “Do you all have a gender?” When their undergraduate students receive this question, it creates an opportunity for STS demonstrate that “how I teach the best is I teach with question, I don’t teach with answer.” Illustrating a dynamic from their classroom, they shared: My queer studies class last semester wanted me to define ‘queer’ for them so I said “Let’s go around the room” and I had ten of them say what queer was and I said, “That’s where we’re gonna be at the end of the semester!” I said, “I’m gonna give you a bunch of theorists and we’re gonna watch some films and I’m not going to give you the answer because I can’t.” I don’t present myself as expert. STS highlights how they use these kinds of opportunities to learn from their students because “it takes some of the power dynamic out of it, that I get to find my way because I find that young students are very challenged by that.” They reflected that “they want you to say ‘this is the answer!” at the beginning of the semester, and that students are incredibly frustrated when they don’t get a clear response, but that what STS has learned is “by the end they look at the world differently, they critically analyze differently.” By refusing to give students the answers to questions, and positioning themself as the expert who holds the truth, it opens up space – albeit uncomfortably, at first – for students to   165 understand that they need to be active participate in critically assessing information in the world and then forming their own ideas.   STS also destabilizes authority in their classroom in other ways; they note that undergraduate students, in our present moment, are particularly attuned to the political and emotional charge of words. As an educator invested in co-creating spaces of learning with students, STS creates opportunities for students to author terminology and content: I was talking about forms of resistance and how the [migrant] caravan was a form of resistance and a hand goes up. My student goes, ‘I’m really angry. The word caravan is so problematic,’ and I said ‘I can hear that, it’s in the lexicon right now, so what’s a better word?’ So, I’m trying to model a better word. ‘Asylum seekers, human beings,’ [the student suggested]. ‘Great, so asylum seekers...’. This moment demonstrates STS’s commitments to meeting students where they are, and not only by being receptive to their sensitivity to language, but also – as discussed above – recognizing the most impactful pedagogical approaches for the “texting generation” by focusing on visual pedagogies, engaging discussions, and probing questions. They have found a way to carefully enter into students’ lives while also hospitably challenging them to unlearn normative absorb-and-repeat pedagogies.   Fredrick’s use of story, with regard to destabilizing rigid relationships to language, is a way to welcome learners into his life and the histories and cultures that have shaped it: “It’s not just language as far as words, but the way things are framed so people will understand it.” He doesn’t enter into public speaking pedagogies with the belief that there is a shared relationship to language or concepts between himself and panel or presentation attendees. He says that part of the problem is that “everyone seems   166 to know what a human is,” reflecting upon his studies in social and cultural anthropology where he learned that concepts of humanity vary across cultures. So much of his work is offering questions to help people uncover their hidden assumptions; he prods with questions like “Why are you saying that?” or “Why are you bringing it up in that way” or “Why are you perceiving it to be about that?” and he notes that most of the time, people don’t take questions like this to be an insult though sometimes “they kind of get caught like a deer in the headlights” or they respond right away and there is a “nice dialogue” so he deems this approach to be an effective technique of disrupting assumptions.   Fredrick reports knowing that as he’s speaking “every person individually is thinking differently about different things and assuming different things,” and his work is to always have this assumption of difference. He challenges the idea that senses of identity and forms of self-expression are universally understood, and he is always wondering about who has the authority to speak on certain topics and why. He says it’s important to foreground “the constructed nature of all the things you’re talking about” while also noting the very real effects identities and concepts have on people’s lives: It’s not about bringing up these topics or words or concepts. It’s how do you infuse the main purpose of it, which is individuals shifting. You don’t do it by just bringing up things that you know.  When choosing stories to read to audiences, Fredrick said that he is consciously reflecting on, “Why am I reading this? And what is the effect?” because he wants to understand where his intentions and real impact intersect, so that there is unity between them. He notes that “the hardest part is figuring out where may be the points of contention” and that he tries to “conceive of or imagine possible reactions or responses”   167 so he feels more prepared. He wants to host learners in his world, but to do so in a way that demonstrates he has tried to put himself in their shoes, that he is also a guest in their worlds through this process of contestation and dynamic exchange.  Synthesis Queer-decolonial educators describe approaching the work of pedagogy from powerful life histories and political orientations that have demonstrated to them the importance of multiplicity and recognizing that different learners and different desired outcomes require creative approaches of engagement. Through multimodality, through experimenting with ways to maintain a sense of complexity and intersectionality, and by staying open to the lives and thought-patterns of students and other learners, queer-decolonial educators attempt to craft spaces of learning that are responsive to the needs of all who are present, including themselves. These educators embody the role of the host-guest by assuming that students’ lives have been just as complex and self-shaping as theirs have been, and they insist that more space be made for holistic and layered selves, theories, histories, activities, and strategies of critical resistance in formal and informal education settings.           168 PART VI: QUEERPHOBIA, TRANSPHOBIA, AND DECOLONIALITY From personal experience, legacy, and politics, queer-decolonial educators come to their work in formal and informal education with rigor, curiosity, and a sense of multiplicity. They understand that in order to situate queer and trans freedom in a politically sound framework, their analyses must include critiques of racism and colonization. While many educational efforts address these issues in isolation, queer-decolonial educators turn to history and legacy in order to craft learning experiences for others that insist we not shy away from the silences – or the polyvocality – of history and the present.   Question 3: How do Queer-Decolonial Educators describe the importance of addressing queerphobia, transphobia, and decoloniality simultaneously?  The queer-decolonial educators interviewed for this research described the importance of intersectionally addressing queerphobia, transphobia, anti-racism, and decoloniality simultaneously for a multitude of reasons. Their rationales carry broad implications for addressing gender, sexuality, race, indigeneity, and (de)coloniality; however, while the implications are broad, their justifications for doing so spoke directly to history and current politics. The educators interviewed elaborated on the importance of challenging concepts of cultural and scientific norms, the legacy of colonization and the ways it intersects with the ongoing developments of capitalism and globalization, and Christianity’s role in colonization. Furthermore, they promoted consideration of the time- and place-specific relationships people and cultures have to gender and sexual difference, the importance of understanding genealogies of these forms of difference, and the ways   169 that immersion in indigenous cultural practices provides much-needed guidance for the work of decolonizing dominant gender and sexual norms, in addition to others.  Refusing the Production of Gender and Sexual Normativity Nearly all of the queer-decolonial educators spoke to the importance of knowing how history and politics have been shaped by legacies of colonialism, capitalism, and Christianity, and the normative constructions of gender and sexuality that have been placed atop a hierarchy of ways-of-being and knowing. Fredrick noted that “all these rules and regulations” regarding binary gender and heterosexuality in “Christian and secular Christian culture” are “constructed in relations of power” that produce senses of self, often referred to as identities. From his study of history, and social and cultural anthropology, he reported an awareness that “gender and sexual norms were diverse across the globe prior to colonization” and have been attacked by the “globalization of bourgeois ideas.”  Fredrick’s critique of bourgeois ideas is a critique of rigid binary gender and heterosexual impositions that have become widespread through global capitalism and its accompanying processes, including the nuclearization of family structures, the privatization of property, forms of alienation from land and labor, and the exploitation of natural resources. He related that “the creation of nation-states” is a “direct formation of colonial practice” and the ideals of nation-states are forms of “creating hierarchies and norms” of acceptable personhood for citizens of a nation, which include binary gender and heterosexual norms. He links the production of norms to “Christian secular” beliefs, that rest heavily on “hierarchies and singular, universal Truth,” beliefs that also show up in the human sciences through “scientific notions” of “normal, acceptable, natural.”   170 Fredrick draws historical and disciplinary connections between “God’s will and natural law” connect religious ideas of sinfulness with scientific ideas of abnormality.  “That’s the whole thing I’m doing: decolonizing. Everybody is living in a dream world, in delusion, that’s what Buddhism says, and it’s not a negative.” Fredrick’s meaning of a dream world is that each person is drawing lines around objects, ideas, and more, using cultural and individual belief systems to parse the infinite complexity of reality into digestible units of meaning, often betraying its complexity in the process. Drawing upon his experience in other spiritual belief systems, Fredrick believes that people raised in dominant U.S. (secular Christian) culture need to move towards destabilizing their drive towards epistemic comfort and resolution, and that instead of “thinking of multiplicity as five hundred little boxes” that can be categorized, people need to “shift away from prioritizing the formations of boundaries” that create distinct categories that separate people into races, genders, sexualities, nationalities, and more. “People in the U.S. categorize obsessively” and our Western categories for gender and sexual difference are not “uniform or universal.” In refusing universalism around difference, Fredrick emphasized his view that “many forms of social violence can directly be addressed by looking at colonial and decolonial practices,” through better understandings of history, politics, and culture.  Desi, Harper, and STS echoed Fredrick’s sentiments in their understandings of the importance of addressing queerphobia, transphobia, racism, and colonialism simultaneously. Desi highlighted the historical and regional particularity of how we address queerphobia and transphobia, noting that the “way that gender and sexual variance has operated” across time, “without all that we put on it now,” speaking to all   171 the norms of identity, behavior, and belief that are part of discourses of gender and sexual norms. Harper reported that, in the worlds he lives in, “there’s a lot of emphasis on the idea of ‘normal’,” and he thinks that “all different contexts have different ideas of what ‘normal’ is.” He went on to say that he thinks about queerness as “some kind of defiance of what is held as ‘normal’,” which, for him, also necessarily includes defiance of racial and colonial standards of personhood.  “A part of what ‘normal’ means is heterosexuality, in the context I live in, with a legally and medically prescribed [binary] gender at the basis of that,” Harper offered as an analysis. He believes these prescribed norms operate “as a form of social control,” similar to the ways other traits of persons are controlled, such as race, ability, citizenship, dominant (colonial) history-telling, and more. Like Fredrick, Harper also sees queerness as a “defiance of prescriptive categorization” and part of the work of “examining dominant ideologies of all kinds” including “how resources are distributed in society.” He warns that queer and trans advocates for gender and sexual difference who are of European-descent need to resist seeing other cultures through an “empty vessel missionary-style” of intervention, where people convince themselves they are “bringing the gifts of civilization.”  Additionally, Harper advocates the importance of consulting the “historical record” of the contexts we want to work and advocate within; each culture where clinical advocacy work exists has a unique “genealogy of what medical transition means.” He notes that as a white person, it has been essential for him to think about how whiteness is portrayed as “often being in search of pathology” and that “if we just find the wrong thing and try to fix it, then the problem will be solved,” demonstrating the legacy of   172 mechanistic and highly isolated conceptions of healing or curing. STS related that “whiteness holds itself up in the center as ‘goodness’” that is internalized by many white folks as a sense of superiority.  STS also reflected that this gendered sense of racial superiority is connected to the colonial legacy of “the feminization of men of color and immigrant men” across various historical moments in the U.S. They further reflected that “socialized heteronormativity in support of white supremacy” has linked performances of heterosexuality and masculinity to performances of whiteness across time in the U.S. This disciplinary regulation is tied to the “primary violence” of “white supremacy, as linked to capitalist domination.” They continued to report their understanding that violence around gender and violence around race are connected: “all those things are stripping us of our humanity in every moment” because “they’re interlocking systems of difference and they’re interlocking with capitalism.” Luz, resonant with the other research participants, stated that “at its root, it’s about property” in reference to colonial and Church processes of institutionalizing “child-rearing as property-based arrangements” that have “required and constructed binary gender in a very particular way” that has “grown a lot of religious, spiritual, political, and social justifications” for these forms of governance of individuals and groups. She continued, “in this part of the world, the Church has been really integral to shaping our ideas about what is normal, what are legitimate relationships, what are legitimate children, and what are legitimate social roles.” When working with undergraduate students, she finds that it is “important to genealogize” social roles like gender and sexuality, especially when it’s happening within practices of producing social hierarchies.   173 “It takes away some of its power if you just show where it comes from,” she continued to report, because “there’s something really transformative” about understanding the origins of problematic concepts and categories.  Luz describes how many students simply accept the belief in only two genders as “scientific fact” that “cannot be debated.” She notes that belief is especially intense for those who are religious or “socially Catholic,” highlighting the ways that in the U.S., what appears as secular is often still deeply infused with structures of (Christian/Catholic) religious belief systems, such as rigid binaries that exist in a moral hierarchy. Luz described these lingering beliefs as the “more insidious tendrils of the Church, in people’s minds” wherein the assumptions of binary gender result in people “being squigged out by gayness or gender difference,” unnecessarily. She notes how challenging this work is when working in the field of ethnic studies, and that her experience working with Latinx students involves helping them to link their experiences of racism with the colonial processes of producing gender and sexual norms alongside racial hierarchies.  Embracing Indigenous Thought and Life-Ways as Decolonial Praxis Throughout the interviews, most of the queer-decolonial educators articulated powerful examples of decolonial praxis by invoking indigenous thought and life-ways as important - if not essential - facets of thinking questions of difference and ethics more broadly, and with specific reference to gender and sexual difference. For those who include indigeneity or indigenous ancestry as a part of their self-understanding, spiritual and healing practices form integral parts of their educational commitments. These educators - along with the others standing in solidarity with indigenous thought and life-ways - articulated the deep resonance they have with the embrace of particularity (anti-  174 universalism), a sense of interconnection across generations and across difference, as well as a strong critique of Western epistemology that frame classroom, text-based, and intellectual learning as only one form of knowledge creation. Fredrick noted that there are elements and questions that he tries to “bring into [his] talks so that spirituality and intellectuality are not separate” because “they’re made up terms” and “that’s the problem [he has] with all these terms in English,” highlighting the reality that even a clear divide between intellectual knowing and spiritual knowing are not entirely distinct for him. He reported that he can’t often tell people about these critiques he has, though, “because they get mad and so you have to sit and develop strategies” to lead them to these realizations without overwhelming them. Fredrick insists that “spirituality is not something that is an idea, it’s something that I live,” challenging the Western idea that spirituality or religious practice is separable from the rest of one’s life. Ever critical of those who draw upon spiritual rhetoric without fully committing to spiritual practice as a life-way, Fredrick warned against a “progressing or liberating self” that rises “into a superior spiritual queerness” because such a stance merely re-inscribes the types of hierarchies that his work and teaching seek to undo. He challenges others to question how such an ascension is often pursued in the interest of acceptance, and that for him, “commitment is not really about me being accepted” because it’s not about him as an individual, but rather, it’s about a “commitment to ancestors” and the broader legacy of which he sees himself to be a part. Fredrick emphasized the importance of refusing to become “disconnected from history and our own ancestry,” which is a particular risk for many in the U.S. who “don’t understand ancestry to even be important”   175 much of the time, unless they are trying to place themselves in an elevated position with regard to hierarchies of race, class, gender, or sexuality.  JM illustrated the necessity of finding opportunities for healing across generations and across difference; he insists that we need to “create and hold space” for difference in this “increasingly multicultural society” because we often find ourselves in situations “with hundreds of people across different cultures and experiences” and within that reality, we have to learn to carry ourselves well, with respect for others. He articulated frustrations with dominant U.S. cultural norms that often get in the way of this approach: Under capitalism, under this increasingly modern and globalized society that wants to continuously make things faster and faster, we need to pause and recognize who’s around us in order to foster a deep recognition that we are a diverse and multicultural society…we need to awaken to what is around us and not deny there is diversity within us and around us. Importantly, JM reported his own practices of slowing down as he draws himself closer to his own ancestral practices, and this research has already explored how some of these practices have been incorporated into his pedagogy with youth. He used to think about direct-service work being only about the “here-and-now,” but today, he understands that his work is also about healing the past and future generations, noting that “there’s a power to this intergenerational healing.” The pull towards indigenous life-ways is part of the work described by Desi, as she emphasized the need to uphold “a different way of seeing and thinking and being in the world,” stressing that such a “different way” necessitates developing a deep respect and understanding for indigenous peoples.   176 Desi insists that we must “practice decolonizing in a way that is inextricable from indigenous communities, indigenous priorities, indigenous struggle, and in the end, indigenous ways of relating to the world around us.” She views this work as consonant with work she has done in LGBTQ+ advocacy, elaborating that “with queerness, there’s an alignment of moving towards that different way of being” that is consonant with indigenous life-ways. Decolonizing, in her view, can guide us toward “present, persistent ways” of living so that we can learn from “variance and persisting cultural differences.” Rather than portraying indigenous peoples and life-ways as no longer here, or merely a part of a past we must return to, Desi reminds us that indigenous peoples are alive and continuing to offer valuable alternatives for how to live more ethically with all the beings around us, in all their difference and uniqueness. “I see [queer freedom and decoloniality] as a great team,” she reflected, emphasizing that the “thing that syncs them together really well” is their shared commitments to “biological and cultural diversity.”  From immersion in native communities, Luz - a Yaqui scholar focused on third gender and two-spirit roles in ceremony and spiritual life - emphasizes that all life practices have a spiritual component. “Christianity has failed us,” she confessed, because “no one has a real sense of ethics that they can really lean into” to make choices about how to intervene on injustices in the world. She notes that an important part of the work of decolonization is learning to access “genetic memory” because as a “Yaqui person, as opposed to ‘just some native person’” she has a specific connection to a particular region: the U.S. borderlands, a materially contested terrain with regard to nation and race, as well as a conceptually contested terrain with regard to gender and sexuality. Her invocation of “just some native person” is meant to demonstrate that while pan-indigenous movements   177 and identities are incredibly valuable, it’s important to remember that to be indigenous means to “be of a place,” inevitably connecting individuals and communities to particular lands and ways of knowing.  Luz reported being told by an elder that it’s important that she interact with younger people, such as students, while they’re in a life-stage where they’re deeply exploring how to make ethical choices. This work includes showing students how important it is to consider questions of justice holistically, which involves looking at questions of race, indigeneity, nation, capitalism, gender, sexuality, and more: “It just seems lazy that people would pick and choose” which issues to support, and she lamented their “quickness to dismiss certain types of issues.” As someone deeply connected to lands and non-human relatives (animals, plants, spirits, and more), she notes the importance that spaces of learning commit to “some kind of land acknowledgement to just point out or notice where we are and acknowledge who’s around, seen or unseen,” pointing to the all-too-common invisibilization of native peoples in the United States.  Continuing her elaboration of indigenous commitments to carry forward different ways of knowing and being, she stated that “everything that you know about how to know stuff comes from someplace, and 99.99% of how you know how to know the stuff that you know is colonial.” She says it not wise to “talk about decolonizing until you’ve really started to think about how you know stuff.” She went on to say: [Students are] out here talking about how we need to put more women of color on the syllabus or something, and I’m like, why are we reading? Why are we in a classroom? Why are we in a university? Let’s really think about how what we take   178 as knowledge, we’re putting so much stake in the written word. That’s already such a huge part of white supremacy. Luz’s comments highlight the dismissal of orality and storytelling, some of the most powerful epistemologies - or ways of knowing - in indigenous life-ways. Her comments remind us of the use of schools and universities as colonial tools of domination, of binary gender-shaping, of alienation from bodies, lands, and intergenerational learning, and more.  Luz went on to emphasize the need to create opportunities for students - across multiple kinds of learning contexts, both formal and informal - to engage in the work of learning how to “listen.” Such listening holds ancestral memory, communion with spirits, and intellectual pursuits as inextricably linked. Additionally, she expressed that she wants create opportunities to “teach people, and learn alongside them, how to notice the subtle differences” between intellectual, emotional, and spiritual “knowing, awareness, [and] consciousness,” because in her estimation, “that’s the real work of decolonizing.”  Synthesis  Queer-decolonial educators, in their descriptions of the value of linking the work of dismantling queerphobia and coloniality, foregrounded that decolonizing our understandings of Western gender and sexual difference requires recommitting ourselves to the work of immersion within and reflection upon the diverse ways of knowing that continue to circulate on the lands where we find ourselves, notably, within the persisting lifeways of Indigenous peoples. These educators’ commitments to difference, to ancestors and future generations, to challenging the very grounds of how we teach, what we consider learning, and what we consider knowledge itself, brings forward a   179 complexity that opens up exciting and transformative possibilities for pedagogy, educational policy, and future research in the field of education.                        180 PART VII: RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION Overview  This findings and analysis of this research project illuminate potential shifts in practice and policy regarding the teaching and advocacy of queer and trans issues in formal and informal education. Additionally, as this project was an exploratory topic, there is an immense need for further studies that investigate other questions that underlie this inquiry. Future research is needed to better understand strategic efforts that might be undertaken to justify the approaches queer-decolonial educators use in their pedagogy. I offer the following in the interest of exploration; these recommendations are intended for discussion and debate, as policy-makers, educational administrators, educators, students, and others, continue to experiment with best practices in working towards queer and trans freedoms and decoloniality simultaneously. After providing these recommendations, I will provide concluding reflections.  Implications and Contributions  At the end of the literature review chapter, I synthesized a framework for a queer-decolonial pedagogy, drawing together features found across both queer and decolonial pedagogies, while also holding together generative tensions that are not meant to be resolved. These tensions are meant to stay engaged, as they activate immense potential for growth, change, and discomfort in both educators and learners alike, not to mention the spaces of learning themselves. The lives, politics, and pedagogies of the six queer-decolonial educators featured in this research resonate with this framework, and our conversations over the years have shaped it immensely, living in dialectical relationship, always co-influencing. A queer-decolonial pedagogy framework provides powerful   181 challenges to the fields of gender and queer studies, trans studies, ethnic studies, and decolonial studies because of the ways we must engage history and culture honestly.  If we look directly at all there is to see within the archive of our own becoming, as peoples, nation-states, and communities, we have to explore the quiet corners, the reluctant informants, and even the silent ghosts; to avoid inconvenient data is to shirk the researcher’s responsibility. We cannot look to gender and sexuality without seeing its imbrication within the production of categories of race, citizen, or Other. Similarly, we cannot look at the production of nation, races, and Others without seeing the ways that tropes of gender and sexuality morph with each political and cultural moment, and that this looks differently across region. To look at any one trait of human personhood in isolation is not simply bad research; it is conveniently avoidant at best, and completely dishonest at worst.   Given that this research project has been completed alongside a specialization in Human Rights Education (HRE), it is my hope that HRE might be a future home for queer-decolonial pedagogies. There is an excitement and an openness in this newer subfield of education that has encouraged me to explore such a complex, though timely, topic. As queer and trans rights and freedom continue to circulate in our social, geopolitical, and historical debates, we need educators and scholars who are able to speak to the complexity of our gendered and sexualized times, always refracted through other lenses of difference. Queer and trans people both are, as we are also made – made into knowable categories, into research anomalies, into political pawns, into embodied protests, and more. The greater agency we are able to exert over both our own being and making, the better we will be able to pass our knowledge on to youth and students.    182 Recommendations for Practice Curriculum Development  Because much of the pedagogical practices of queer-decolonial educators are undocumented, it would be a valuable undertaking to provide these educators with resources and support to document activities, lesson plans, and entire curricula that focuses on the teaching of queer and trans issues in diverse communities. Investing resources in this work is likely to contribute to more meaningful engagements about gender and sexual difference in people of color, immigrant, Indigenous, working-class, and rural communities, as well as in communities for whom English is not their first language.   A curriculum developed in pursuit of a queer-decolonial pedagogy might look different than a traditionally-composed curriculum, particularly because it may have a significant amount of built-in flexibility and may require ongoing adaptation throughout the teaching/learning process. Curricula developers would need to addressing issues around publication and would have to find ways to allow curricula to maintain its necessarily dynamic nature. Additionally, there will be necessary pre-work involved for any educator seeking to develop queer-decolonial curricula, including self-reflection on positionality and explorations of the historical and political context of people and place. Pre-work leading up to curricula develop may take months or years before a pedagogue is prepared to draft curricula for use with students. Similarly, activities and discussion may need to be modified frequently in order to respond to current events in a community or region.    183 Developing “best processes” rather than “best practices” is essential to the work of queer-decolonial pedagogy. These processes include ongoing self-reflection on the part of educators and administrations, including reflections on positionalities of race, class, age, gender, sexuality, education privilege, language access, and more. Additionally, developing ways to acknowledge the particularity of land and place is crucial, as many of our teaching tools in schools in California ignore the existence of Indigenous Californians who are alive and thriving today. Along these lines, queer-decolonial educators must also attend to the history of the context they work within, in order to understand the development of homophobic, transphobic, and racist systems of belief, as they are unique to each place or institution. These efforts are iterative, as culture and history are not stagnant; queer-decolonial pedagogy is responsive to current events and history, simultaneously.  Recruitment and Hiring  It is essential that institutions of formal and informal education actively recruit queer and trans people of color, queer and trans immigrants, queer and trans Indigenous people, and other queer and trans people who have critical analyses of gender, sexuality, race, immigration, capitalism, colonialism, and Western ways-of-knowing. These kinds of educators have been systematically excluded from teaching roles because of legal, political, social, cultural, and linguistic discrimination. Moving forward, in order to more effectively create a politicized citizenry that is equipped to respond to the cultural and regional needs of a given place or community, queer-decolonial educators can serve as an invaluable resource.    184  Recruitment and hiring will need to involve more than posting job ads that encourage diverse candidates’ applications. Recruitment and hiring will need to involve immersion in communities in order to identify organic and emergent leaders who demonstrate a depth of awareness of struggles from within their communities. Seeking potential educators among people who do not always immediately appear to be leaders is an important part of this work, as queer and trans people within most communities are often denied opportunities to take up visible leadership positions. Additionally, maintaining an awareness of dynamics of introversion/extroversion and English language abilities will be important for working towards cognitive and linguistic diversity. While this may present challenges within formal educational settings, it may be more strategic to begin making shifts in hiring practices for those institutions that foreground informal educational opportunities. Often, diverse hiring requires deferring to candidates who perhaps do not have the most qualifications on paper or who do not have the more eloquent answers during interviews, but who nonetheless show immense potential for learning and personal growth.  Immersion in Place  Norms of gender and sexuality are culturally- and regionally-specific; therefore, formal and informal education curricula need to demonstrate an immersion in place. Understanding, recognizing, and teaching about all the peoples who inhabit a given place – including the Indigenous peoples who have been there or have been relocated there – will contribute to a sense of relevance and will allow for shifting and embedded analyses of gender and sexual norms. From this research, it became clear that the terms people use to self-identify, the tensions across groups of people, and the regional politics great shape   185 possibilities for queer and trans youth and adults, both inside and outside of educational communities.  Such a responsive approach will allow educators and learners to better understand past and present harm done to queer and trans people, as well as women, children, men, and other marginalized groups. This research demonstrates the need for intersectional solidarity to avoid a search for the most-oppressed, but instead to understand the multitude of ways people become marginalized through interlocking systems of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, immigrant discrimination, and more. If educators are unaware of the social, cultural, political, and spiritual/religious norms that operate in diverse communities, it will be difficult to create learning experiences that are responsive to what is challenging when teaching about gender and sexual difference.  Recommendations for Policy Culturally- and Regionally-Responsive Advocacy  Advocacy work for queer and trans issues must be focused on the culturally- and regionally-specific understandings of gender and sexual difference. Politics, culture, laws, and institutions across the United States – and the sovereign Indigenous lands it stewards – are highly variegated. Making use of homogenizing frameworks of gender and sexual difference may continue to alienate potential allies and force diverse cultural- and self-understandings of gender and sexual difference into universal frameworks of personhood that deny community- and self-determination.  Interdisciplinarity in Education The experiences, politics, and pedagogies of the queer-decolonial educators interviewed for this research point to the instability of colonial academic disciplines. In the spirit of   186 integrity to cultural and biological diversity, engaging history, advocacy, and learning more holistically will serve as a valuable step towards decolonizing sites of learning in the United States and occupied Indigenous lands. There are calls from a number of disciplines and fields to break down rigid disciplinary borders to make education more relevant to real-life problem solving. Such siloed thinking creates hyper-specialization, that while useful when working in collaboration with others, and that narrowly defining and analyzing social problems runs the risk of creating narrow solutions that do not attend to the holistic needs of a community or interest group.  Leaning into the “host-guest” role of hospitality, ongoing learning, and un-disciplining scholarship, ways-of-knowing, and pedagogy will all serve to resituate formal and informal education in the urgent political and ecological moment we find ourselves in. It will be important to draw upon pedagogical and research practices that engage the best of what each discipline has to offer to the work of cultural and environmental justice and survival. We find ourselves in a moment of high-stakes militarization, environmental devastation, increased Right-wing and ethno-nationalist movements globally, as well as increased violence against minoritized groups, including immigrants, Indigenous Peoples, and queer and trans youth and adults. A queer-decolonial pedagogy can be part of a broader array of solutions to address the breakdown of social relationships across difference, to foster collaborative educational and political life that respond to our diverse needs in these challenging times.  Critical Literacy of Research and Statistics  Advocacy efforts for minoritized groups often rely upon research science and statistics that have problematic foundations, particularly when efforts frame solutions in   187 ways that provide special reference to targeted groups as the most in need of resources. Such a framing will inevitably incur backlash and accusation of “special interests.” While these efforts to provide more resources for oppressed groups is understandable, we need to be cautious as we move forward with regard to how we assess need and distribution of resources. Without emplacing social sciences and humanities frameworks alongside a critical analysis of the research and statistics we often draw upon to justify education and intervention in the interest of social justice more broadly, we may repeat mistakes of the past that continued to highlight incommensurable differences rather than helping students and educators understand the nuances of teaching shared history alongside particular ones. Infusing social sciences and humanities pedagogies with critical literacy around research science and statistics will ground advocacy work in a critical legacy of the human sciences. This critical legacy also lends much needed perspective when language and understandings of gender and sexual difference are embedded in colonial, Western, and Christian understandings of selfhood. Because of the diversity of cultures present in the United States today, it is essential that our advocacy demonstrate responsiveness to these assumptions.  Recommendations for Future Research Analysis of Culturally- and Regionally-Responsive Advocacy Work  It would be valuable to create an overview of best practices for teaching about gender and sexual difference across the diverse cultures and regions of the United States, in sites of formal and informal education. Such an undertaking would be valuable in order to demonstrate the immense differences that history, politics, and place continue to have on identities often described in universal terms. This research should be undertaken   188 to better understand what the similarities and differences are across diverse pedagogies of gender and sexual difference that are relevant to the communities who engage them and draw upon them for advocacy purposes, both within and outside of educational institutions.  Spirituality in Education: Ethics and Indigenous Pedagogies  Many of the queer-decolonial educators spoke to powerful connections to non-Christian spiritual practice. Issues of spirituality, religion, and education are hotly debated in the United States, yet these debates often rely on the assumption that the spiritual belief system under debate is Christianity. At best, these discussions also include mention of Jewish and Muslim students and educators. Because queer-decolonial educators spoke to the importance of spirituality in their own development of responsibility and ethics towards the goals of social justice in education for queer and trans people, it would benefit debates of church-state separation if we had better understandings of how non-Abrahamic spiritual practices, particularly Indigenous spirituality, can be useful frameworks and commitments to reflect on in crafting pedagogies of difference and cultural/biological survival.  While church-state separation may continue to be useful for providing a legal basis to ensure Christian hegemony is held in check, it also may be useful to challenge whether Christianity has become an all-encompassing stand-in for debates about religiosity or spirituality within education. Future research would benefit from looking at how non-Christian/non-Abrahamic spiritual practices might provide valuable frameworks for developing senses of ethics and responsibility in the interests of gender, LGBTQ+,   189 environmental, racial, and Indigenous justice efforts, particularly when such efforts seek to live at the intersections of multiple commitments.   Documenting Cultural Frameworks for Gender and Sexual Difference  For educators, it would be useful to have access to resources that portray the vast diversity in cultural understandings of gender and sexual difference. To this end, it would be valuable to pursue research projects that seek integrity in representing these forms of difference without reducing them to Euro-American understandings of personhood and identity development. Putting these cultural frameworks for gender and sexual difference alongside activities that challenge colonial ways of knowing and being will be essential, and research should be undertaken to document “best processes.” If educators are able to more deeply understand how cultural frames of knowing and being shape our beliefs regarding gender and sexual difference – particularly its origins/cause – then we will be able to approach this work with more openness and not relying solely upon a homogenizing Euro-American framework that often alienates more learners than it engages, particularly when working across racial, cultural, and linguistic differences.   Intergenerational Research with Queer and Trans Youth and Elders  Many of the queer-decolonial educators discussed practices of indigenizing their pedagogy and life practices through immersion in spiritual and Indigenous communities and life-ways. In these processes of indigenizing, there are inevitable tensions that emerge, including confrontations with racism, cultural appropriation, tokenism, homophobia, and transphobia, particularly across life experience, identity, and generation. Many – though not all – queer-decolonial educators came into their senses of queerness or transness in contexts different than the cultural contexts they feel most   190 connected to or have come back into. From this reality, we have seen that the dominant frameworks of gender and sexual difference rely heavily on mind-body splits and on identity as individually determined.  These frameworks often do not have cross-cultural resonance, and can sometimes result in tensions across generations, who frequently live in different relation to culturally-based ways of knowing and being. Intergenerational research with queer and trans youth and elders from people of color, immigrant, Indigenous, and other communities would benefit efforts towards challenging colonial practices of pedagogy in gender and sexual diversity advocacy work. Such research would also aid in developing hospitable practices of welcoming people into a sense of intergenerational humility while exploring questions of family/kinship, gender, sexuality, identity, as well as cultural survival and remaking friendship in unlikely places.  Concluding Reflections  The process of developing and carrying out this research has left me indelibly changed, in a number of ways. Listening to the narratives of the six queer-decolonial educators interviewed for this project has led me back to younger versions of myself. Upon hearing their stories of experiencing and witnessing violence in and around school and other communities, I was reminded of my personal histories with violence. This research project has been motivated by those histories that I have tucked away, but that still live on in my commitments to pedagogies of difference that can shape intergenerational and cross-cultural reckoning. As a mixed-descent queer and trans person of color, I have confronted many challenges in spaces of learning, both as a student, and as an educator. It has been validating to hear the personal stories of the other   191 queer-decolonial educators, and I did not anticipate that would be a result of this research experience.  I have often struggled to maintain a sense of freedom and safety as a learner and as an educator because of behaviors across the spectrum of racism, queerphobia, transphobia, adultism, and more. This research has shown me that while I didn’t know it at the time, my choices that led me to informal educational work have perhaps been part of my long tenure in the field of education. In communities of queer and trans people, it is particularly challenging to sustain employment in formal education, and even more challenging for queer and trans people of color. The frameworks and processes proposed by this project point to the limitations in formal education, and even as these limitations are important to observe, I am hesitant to be overly critical. As an educator in informal learning contexts, I feel most capable of speaking to work within that professional sphere, but also have experience working across the formal-informal education divide to support educators in formal classrooms on strategies for adapting the processes elaborated above. These kinds of collaborations illuminate the contours and limitations in both formal and informal education, as informal education often does not have the kind of broad-sweeping reach and influence that formal education does.  During the process of writing the literature review, I struggled to fully accept just how impoverished my own public education in California had been, particularly with regard to Indigenous peoples and their histories and continued struggles in California, and in what is now called the U.S. more broadly. Recognizing my own complicity with the ideology and practices of settler colonialism as a citizen of the dominant global imperial superpower has been – and continues to be – painful. This pain is likely   192 intensified for me, as I am descended both from Indigenous peoples of North America and settler Europeans who assimilated into whiteness. Assimilation occurs fully only once we forget that we have forgotten. Just as cultural practices are erased and taken away, so too can they be rediscovered, with an unending stream of gratitude for those who have maintained them all along. This process is fraught for those coming from spaces of reclamation, as such claims to indigeneity are often used to absolve individuals and groups – particularly Chicanx and Latinx people – of continued collaboration with the aims of settler colonialism, and how those aims and ideologies shape advocacy for queer and trans difference in people of color, immigrant, and Indigenous communities. I have learned how important it is to be patient and to find community elders and leaders who are well-positioned to wield influence and serve as examples for change. I have also learned how important it is to be humble, and to learn why connections to binary gender and heterosexuality have been so formative of peoples’ senses of belonging, of family, of culture, and of surviving attempted genocide or separation. It is dangerous when decolonization serves only as a metaphor or as a site for crafting pure identities; it is powerful when decolonizing – or indigenizing – education is an ongoing practice of freedom, a lifeway.  The queer-decolonial educators I spoke with challenged me to be more expansive in my own teaching about gender and sexual difference, particularly with regard to how it connects to other social justice issues; I had not previously considered issues of environmental justice to the degree our current climate crisis warrants. Had I been exploring gender and sexual difference from an Indigenous, immigrant, or environmental   193 refugee perspective, I would have already known just how intensely struggles around land are intimately linked to questions of identity, gender, sexuality, culture, family, kinship, body, and spirituality. Ignoring questions of climate change, the sacredness of land for Indigenous peoples, and how gender and sexuality are often linked to culturally-particular and land-based cosmologies is evidence of my socialization into dominant settler colonial norms. This, like many other reflections from the research process, has been incredibly uncomfortable to contend with. Fortunately, that discomfort has allowed for an increased sense of freedom. While many argue that culturally-specific relationships to gender and sexuality are conformist or confining, I’ve found that it is precisely through engaging with such relationships that queer-decolonial educators are able to respond to the anxiety communities have when learning how to integrate queer and trans people into educational, social, and spiritual life. Education, when approached in this way, is not only about transferring information and cultural or intergenerational knowledge (which is itself incredibly important), but it can also provide opportunities for psycho-social healing. Queer-decolonial educators play a powerful role, opening us up to difference by sharing new/old frameworks and learning experiences – living the role of host-guest. Through these transformative experiences, we come to see that it is entirely possible to find deep friendship, even in the most unlikely places.        194 REFERENCES Adams, D.W. & DeLuzio, C. (Eds.)

Doctoral Researcher: Mauro Osborne, graduate student in School of Education, Department of International and Multicultural education  I. Purpose of this Research Project: a. This study involves interviews and a focus group with adult educators in the Bay Area of California.  b. The nature of this study is investigative, in order to better understand the ways diverse queer-decolonial educators draw upon experience and cultural legacy to shape their politics and pedagogies of gender and sexual difference.  c. This study is being conducted as part of a doctoral research project in pursuit of a dissertation at the University of San Francisco, in San Francisco, California. d. This study will attempt to interview between five and seven individuals, including collectively during a focus group. e. The subject pool of interviewees will include adult educators who currently work in formal and informal educational contexts, focusing on the overlap across topics of race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, immigration, and indigeneity.  II. Procedures: a. Study participants will be read a series of questions, one-by-one, in order to learn more information about their experiences developing their own political perspectives and how those perspectives shape their approaches to pedagogy on queer and decolonial topics. b. Each interview will last between approximately 60 and 240 minutes and will occur across 2-3 separate interviews.  c. Interviews will take place at a location selected by the interviewee, keeping in mind the importance of confidentiality and comfort when speaking about potentially sensitive subject matter. d. The research instrument is an interview questionnaire comprised of approximately 20 questions.  e. A follow-up focus group will be scheduled with as many individual participants as possible to share educational activities, curricula, writing, or any other educational artifact they have developed. The focus group will last between 120 and 240 minutes.  III. Risks: a. There is a potential risk of emotional distress due to the sensitive nature of some questions relating to personal experiences. Recalling unpleasant experiences can sometimes cause distress for interview participants. b. The researcher is an experienced advocate and will perform a “warm hand-off” to support services if an interviewee is displaying signs of distress at the time of the interview, or if the researcher is contacted after the interview has concluded and is notified by the interviewee that they are experiencing distress. Additionally, the following resources are available to study participants, and are confidential/anonymous:  National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  Pacific Center for Human Growth 1.800.273.8255     1.800.309.2131 www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org   www.pacificcenter.org   IV. Benefits:   224 a. Indirect benefits may include having the opportunity to explore their own connections between experience, legacy, politics, and pedagogy, as well as connecting with other educators doing similar work.  b. Larger social benefits include contributing to research that discusses topics not widely covered in previous academic research and will help to develop a better understanding of educator approaches to complex topics. c. No promise or guarantee of benefits has been made to encourage participation.  V. Extent of Confidentiality: a. Subject identities will be known only to the researcher, Mauro Osborne, and to other focus group participants.  b. Each interview subject will be given a participant identification number. Only the researcher will know which interview participants correspond to which identification numbers. When writing up the analysis of interviews, the researcher will change names and any other identifying markers (i.e. place of employment).  c. The researcher will have access to the researcher data and will share it only with the dissertation committee chair, Dr. David Donahue. d. It is possible that the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may view this study’s collected data for auditing purposes. The IRB is responsible for the oversight of the protection of human subjects involved in research. e. The interview data will not be destroyed, but will be stored in a secured (locked) location and will only be accessible to the researcher.  VI. Freedom to Withdraw: a. Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. b. Subjects are free to not answer any question that they choose without penalty. c. There may be circumstances under which the investigator may determine that a subject should not continue to participate in the research.  VII. Subject’s Responsibilities:  I voluntarily agree to participate in this study. I have the following responsibilities:  - To show up to my scheduled interview date/time  - To ensure one’s own confidentiality  VIII. Subject’s Permission  I have read the Consent Form and conditions of this project. I have had all my questions answered.

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, queer and trans advocacy has garnered increased attention in political, popular, and educational debates. The current prevailing models to explain and justify gender and sexual difference rely on understandings of selfhood that were developed in colonial, clinical, U.S., white, and middle-class cultural contexts. The cultural particularity of these most-accessible models has produced marginalization of queer and trans students and educators who have different understandings of gender and sexual difference. Queer-decolonial educators are individuals who are critical of colonial, Western understandings of gender, sexuality, and difference more broadly. These educators often work within contexts that do not allow them to draw explicitly upon the ways that personal experience, cultural legacy, and politicization shape pedagogy, which often limits abilities to connect with youth and students; conversely, these educators also often work outside of formal educational contexts, and thus, pedagogical approaches to teaching differences of gender and sexuality are often not well-documented nor institutionalized. Queer-decolonial educators work to understand the ways that diverse communities are receptive of, and resistant to, particular narratives of gender and sexual difference, often looking to legacies of legal, colonial, clinical, and social violence around gender and sexuality. The methodology and methods used for this study include community-accountable research and qualitative interviews inspired by queer-of-color and Indigenous feminisms. In-depth interviews were undertaken with six queer-decolonial educators who historicized and theorized life experiences, elaborating themes of movement across contexts, familiarity with violence, refusals of homogeneity, and responsibility to legacy, as well as pedagogical efforts towards multimodality and intersectionality. These six educators also described the importance of addressing queerphobia, transphobia, and decoloniality simultaneously in the interests of refusing the production gender and sexual normativity, and placed such refusals within critiques of racism, xenophobia, and settler colonialism, each crediting Indigenous epistemologies or life practices as foundational to remaking just worlds",
