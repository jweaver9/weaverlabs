The Impact of Sexual Orientation Vocal Cues on Heterosexual Persons’ First Impression and Hiring DecisionFabio Fasoli and Peter Hegarty University of SurreyAuthor NoteFabio Fasoli, School of Psychology, University of Surrey; Peter Hegarty, School of Psychology, University of Surrey.This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement 700844. Project title ‘Beyond “Straight Talking”: The Consequences of Vocal Cues to Sexual Identity for Modern Prejudice’ (Acronym: TheGayVoice). Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Fabio Fasoli, School of Psychology, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH. Email: f.fasoli@surrey.ac.ukAbstractIn three studies (N = 340), we tested whether vocal cues to a person’s sexual orientation prompted sexual orientation discrimination in heterosexual individuals when hiring leaders. Our results inform how gender and sexual orientation intersect to produce discriminatory effects in the hiring context. Heterosexual participants listened to short clips of voices that sounded like job candidate was a lesbian or heterosexual woman, or a gay or heterosexual man, and rated all for job suitability and employability. Candidates applied for jobs as leaders (Study 1), as leaders or assistants (Study 2), and for leadership roles that varied in both gender role and status (Study 3). Sexual orientation discrimination occurred in all three studies and was greater among women job candidates. Refuting role congruity theory, several findings disconfirmed the prediction that lesbian-sounding women would be advantaged when stereotyped as masculine and when applying for leadership roles. Rather, in line with status-beliefs theory, lesbian-sounding women and gay-sounding men were rated and ranked poorly to the extent that they were perceived as less competent than heterosexual candidates. Findings suggest that hiring discrimination occurs in subtle ways, such as when individuals sound gay/lesbian. This has implications for recruitment as well as sexual-orientation discrimination court cases.  Keywords: gaydar, leadership, stereotyping, discrimination, intersectionalityA Leader Doesn’t Sound Lesbian! The Impact of Sexual Orientation Vocal Cues on Heterosexual Persons’ First Impression and Hiring DecisionLesbian and gay (LG) leaders exist. Since 2013, the OUTstanding list (Financial Times, 2018) celebrates successful LG leaders, making them visible worldwide and promoting them as role models. In 2018, this list included 123 gay men but only 38 lesbian women, suggesting that lesbian leaders are less visible than gay men and may face more difficulties in reaching top positions.  Although LG individuals reach top jobs, they continue to navigate discrimination (Ahmed, Andersson, & Hammarstedt, 2013; Patacchini, Ragusa, & Zenou, 2015) and career obstacles to get there (Parnell, Lease, & Green, 2012). When LG individuals “come out,” they can become targets of discrimination during the hiring process (Ahmed et al., 2013; Helb, Foster, Mannix, & Dovidio, 2002; Horvath & Ryan, 2003). LG applicants can be perceived as inadequate and unsuitable leaders and are less likely to be called to interview than similarly competent heterosexual individuals (Fassinger, Shullman, & Stevenson, 2010; Liberman & Golom, 2015; Steffens, Niedlich, & Ehrke, 2016; Tilcsik, 2011; Weichselbaumer, 2003). Here, we examine employment discrimination triggered by vocal cues to sexual orientation. In so doing, we also analyze whether lesbian women are discriminated against more than gay men when applying for leadership positions.  In Western societies, such as the United Kingdom (UK), discrimination against LG workers goes against equality laws (ILGA Europe, 2018), making sexual orientation discrimination punishable. Moreover, in most of these societies, expressions of anti-gay attitudes are condemned (Moneith, Deneen, & Tooman, 1996; see also Crandall, Eshleman, & O’Brien, 2002). Consequently, sexual prejudice can be seen as a thing of the past (Morrison & Morrison, 2003) but still manifests in subtle forms especially in ambiguous situations where discriminatory behaviors cannot be labelled as such. Identifying discrimination can be difficult, in part, because sexual orientation is an ambiguous social category (Tskhay & Rule, 2013) that can be kept private (Beatty & Kirby, 2006). People use minimal cues to categorize others’ sexual orientation (Fasoli, Maass, & Sulpizio, 2016; Rule, 2017). Gaydar is usually defined as the ability to correctly guess who is gay and who is heterosexual from such minimal clues (Rule, 2017). As a consequence of gaydar, discrimination can occur when sexual orientation is inferred from a person’s behavior during the hiring process (Helb et al., 2002). Such discrimination may not be attributed to sexual orientation as its cause is ambiguous (see Sue, 2010). Our studies respond to a recent call to study such subtle cues to sexual orientation that affect leaders’ career paths (Barrantes & Eaton, 2018). We draw on research showing that voice can lead to discrimination on the basis of inferred sexual orientation (Fasoli & Maass, 2018) to hypothesize that auditory cues of sexual orientation can prompt unconscious bias in hiring for leadership positions. In real life, sexual orientation discrimination is often triggered by the perception that someone is LG, rather than knowing for sure that the person is LG (see UK Government Equalities Office, 2018 for UK data). Such discrimination also affects LG individuals’ intentions to report instances of discrimination (see Herek, Cogan, & Gills, 2002).Both leadership and gaydar are gendered phenomena. Leadership is stereotypically perceived as a male-dominated role that requires characteristics typically associated with men such as masculinity, competence and agency; thus, men are usually rated as more adequate leaders than women (for a review see Koenig, Eagly, Mitchell, & Ristikari, 2011). Perceptions of sexual orientation go hand in hand with gender stereotypes: individuals are usually categorized as heterosexual by default and only re-categorized as lesbian or gay if cues to gender atypicality are available (Lick & Johnson, 2016). Regarding vocal cues, people are often assumed to be heterosexual, but individuals who sound gender atypical (i.e., masculine-sounding women and feminine-sounding men) are more often re-categorized as LG (Gaudio, 1994; Munson, 2007). According to Fassinger et al. (2010), being perceived as gender atypical can represent an obstacle for LG individuals to reach top jobs and leadership roles, but research has not examined if this occurs to the same extent for gay men and lesbian women. The 2018 OUTstanding list illustrates that women are underrepresented among LG leaders. At first glance, auditory gaydar seems like an unlikely explanation of any such gender difference in leadership. Regardless of sexual orientation, men believe their voices work as sexual orientation cues more than women do (Fasoli, Hegarty, Maass, & Antonio, 2018). Hence, gay men, but not lesbian women, would seem to be more likely targets of discrimination when voices function as a subtle sexual orientation cue. However, research on gender and leadership leads us to consider several competing predictions about how gender and sexuality might intersect to produce discriminatory effects in the hiring context. Before describing those predictions, we first consider the basic evidence that auditory gaydar prompts social discrimination. Auditory Gaydar and DiscriminationIndividuals can sometimes accurately guess others’ sexual orientation based on the sound of their voices (Fasoli et al., 2016; Rule, 2017). Researchers have aimed to identify the acoustic differences that may exist in LG and heterosexual speech and has pointed to differences in vowel production (Munson, McDonald, DeBoe, & White, 2006; Pierrehumbert, Bent, Munson, Bradlow, & Bailey, 2004) and duration (Sulpizio et al., 2015; for consonants see Linville, 1998), but not in fundamental frequencies (Kachel, Simpson, & Steffens, 2018). Voice-based categorization of sexual orientation is not always accurate (see Miller, 2018; Sulpizio et al., 2015), but often guided by stereotypes. The most common stereotype is that heterosexual people have “gender typical” voices, whilst lesbian and gay people have “gender atypical” voices and this affects how speakers are categorized (Kachel, Simpson, & Steffens, 2017, 2018; Munson, 2007). Another common stereotype refers to frontal lisping; men with sibilant /s/ are likely to be perceived as gay (Crist, 1997; Mack & Muson, 2012; Van Borsel & Van de Putte, 2014). Women with lower pitched voices are more often perceived as lesbian (Waksler, 2001), even though no differences in pitch between lesbian and heterosexual women have been found (Kachel et al., 2017). A monotone speech pattern also seems to trigger a perception of female voices as lesbian-sounding (Moonwoman-Baird, 1997). Hence, although variations among LG speakers’ voices exist, men who have nasalized voices and speech that included sibilant /s/,  higher fundamental frequencies and vowel space, and women whose voices have lower pitch and lower vowel space dispersion are likely to sound like gay men and lesbian women respectively in the ears of heterosexual listeners (see Kachel, Radtke, Skuk, Zäske, Simpson, & Steffens, 2018). This along with the general impression of LG-sounding speakers as also sounding less gender typical (more feminine for gay-sounding men and more masculine for lesbian-sounding women; see Zimman, 2010).  \tAs a consequence, a speaker who sounds LG to others is more likely to be inferred to have gender atypical interests (Fasoli, Maass, Paladino, & Sulpizio, 2017; see also Fasoli, Maass, & Sulpizio, 2018), to be less competent (Campbell-Kibler, 2011; Tracy, 2016), and to be more confident and outgoing (Tracy, 2016). Moreover, in two separate studies, Fasoli et al., (2017) demonstrated that inferred sexual orientation affected employability of female and male CEOs. Participants listened to short audio files or saw pictures of candidates whose voices or faces conveyed different sexual orientations. LG-sounding voices presented patterns of acoustic cues that have been illustrated above and led listeners to perceive the speakers as either LG or heterosexual. Faces instead were consistently categorized as LG or heterosexual on the basis of minimal features such as eyes, nose, mouth (see Rule, 2017). Research has shown that turned up noses, smaller foreheads and masculine face shape lead individuals to perceive women as lesbian while convex cheeks, short noses and faces are associated with perception of men as gay (Skorska, Geniole, Vrysen, McCromick & Bogaert, 2015). Heterosexual-sounding candidates were preferred and received higher salary allocations. This sexual orientation discrimination was triggered more by vocal cues than by visual cues but was similar regardless of both target speaker gender and the accuracy of participants’ sexual orientation categorization. Indeed, these authors showed that “discrimination does not necessarily require correct recognition of speaker’s sexual orientation” (Fasoli et al., 2017, p. 1272) and that everyone who sounds LG is at risk of stigmatization. Hence, we predict that LG-sounding individuals would be discriminated against in the hiring process.Our work builds on Fasoli et al. (2017) and extends it in two crucial ways. First, Fasoli et al. (2017) conducted their research in Italy, but we conducted ours in the UK. Attitudes toward sexual minorities are more positive in the UK than in Italy (Eurobarometer, 2015), and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people enjoy more legal protection from discrimination in the UK than Italy (ILGA Europe, 2018). Consequently, the UK, more than Italy, is a country where subtle rather than explicit forms of sexual orientation discrimination may occur. Second, Fasoli et al. (2017) did not analyze the intersection of gender and sexual orientation discrimination. The literature on stereotyping and employability demands that we conceptualize predictions at this intersection. Role Congruity and Status BeliefsGender and sexual orientation might intersect to create patterns of discrimination in the hiring process for two broad reasons: role congruity and status. Leadership is usually perceived as a masculine domain that requires typically masculine skills. The think manager-think male effect (Schein & Davidson, 1993) describes how women are perceived as inadequate leaders because they lack masculine skills and competencies usually attributed to men. This phenomenon is in line with lack-of-fit (Heilman, 1983) and role congruity theories (Eagly & Karau, 2002). The lack-of-fit theory (Heilman, 1983) suggests that a person who possess traits that are inconsistent with the job role would be perceived as a lack of fit and as having low likelihood to success in that role. Since women are seen through the lens of gender stereotypes, they cannot be a fit with typically masculine/male-dominated jobs. The role congruity theory (Eagly & Karau, 2002) developed this thinking by emphasizing the descriptive content of stereotypes. This theory indicates that, because of the incongruity between the way women are stereotypically perceived and the shared belief that leadership is prototypically masculine and male-dominated, women are perceived as less adequate for leadership roles and are judged less positively if they hold such roles. Lesbian women and gay men are subject to very different gender stereotypes than are heterosexual women and men. The gender inversion stereotype leads gay men to be perceived as more feminine and lesbian woman as more masculine (Kite & Deaux, 1987), and such stereotyping persists in occupational contexts (Blashill & Powlishta, 2009). This stereotype has been invoked to explain why gay men can be perceived as a suitable fit for typically feminine jobs, and lesbian women for masculine types of jobs (see Barrantes & Eaton, 2018; Pichler, Varma, & Bruce, 2010; Rule, Bjonsdottir, Tskhay, & Ambady, 2016). Gender inversion stereotyping goes hand in hand with voice-based categorization of sexual orientation: Not only women who sound masculine and men who sound feminine are likely to be perceived as LG (Fasoli et al., 2016), but such inferences also activate gender inverted attributions with regards to the speaker’s personality and interests (Fasoli et al., 2017). Consequently, activating the gender inversion stereotype via vocal cues of sexual orientation and using it to fit candidates to jobs could disadvantage gay men but advantage lesbians in the usual context where leadership is perceived as something masculine that requires skills typically associated with men. Jointly, the gender inversion stereotype and role congruity theories predict a pattern of discrimination such that gay men bear the brunt of sexual orientation discrimination. As a matter of fact, Liberman and Golom (2015) showed that there is little overlap between the characteristics associated with gay managers and with successful managers, but more overlap between the stereotypes of lesbian managers and of successful managers. Ahmed et al. (2013) found that discrimination against gay men occurred specifically when masculine jobs were concerned while lesbian women faced discrimination when applying for typically feminine but not for typically masculine jobs. A different set of predictions about intersectional patterns of discrimination in the hiring process follows from status beliefs, and the fact that sexual orientation is a status dimension. Status refers to the advantages/disadvantages that individuals have as members of specific social groups, and status defines power-based relationships and inequalities (see Ridgeway, 1991). Status beliefs are cultural beliefs that attribute higher power, competence and skills to one social group over others (Ridgeway, 2001). Gender stereotypes overlap with status beliefs, because being competent, assertive, and masculine are associated with higher status, whilst being communal and feminine are associated with lower status (Berger, Fisek, Norman, & Zelditch, 1997). These beliefs are shared and they explain subtle forms of occupational segregation (Ridgeway, 2001). Even individuals who have egalitarian intentions still act on status beliefs and favor men over women (see Rashotte & Webster, 2005). Sexual orientation defines status too. Heterosexuals represent the default social category and, because of that, gain advantages (see Prewitt-Freilino & Bosson, 2008), while LG individuals represent a low-status group that continues to be accorded far fewer legal rights in many of the Western countries (see ILGA Europe, 2018). Accordingly, auditory gaydar is an inference about a status-related characteristic. Indeed, a recent study found that heterosexual men wish that their voices communicate their sexual orientation more than all other social groups do as this conveys their higher status (Fasoli, Hegarty, Maas, & Antonio, 2018). In the occupational realm, both gay men and lesbian women are less likely to get promotions (Levine, 1979) or to reach high-status positions (Frank, 2006) than same-gender heterosexuals. A recent analysis in the UK found that LG individuals reached only low-level managerial positions whilst top high-status positions were reserved for heterosexual individuals (Aksoy, Carpenter, Frank, & Huffman, 2018). LG individuals’ difficulties in getting top positions may be due to status beliefs that create expectations of low competence (Childers, 2000; Webster, Hysom, & Fullmer, 1998). Among LG individuals, lesbian women represent a lower status group because they are a double minority – women and lesbians (Garnets & Kimmel, 1991; Gedro, 2010; Woodruffle-Burton & Bairstow, 2013; see also Fasoli, Cadinu, Carnaghi, Galdi, Guizzo, & Tassara, 2018). Their gender and sexual identities are usually devaluated (see Hancock, 2007) making lesbian women an invisible target (Purdie-Vaughns & Eibach, 2008). This being the case, status beliefs theory suggests that lesbian women, not gay men, will bear the brunt of sexual orientation discrimination in hiring. Stereotyping To further examine our main prediction based on role congruity and status beliefs, stereotyping in relation to agency and communion need to be considered. Agency/competence is stereotypically attributed to men and communality/warmth to women (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002). Women are often discriminated against in leadership contexts because they are stereotyped as lacking agency and competence (see Eagly & Chin, 2010; Eagly & Krau, 2002). Studies have also suggested that agency and communion attributions are assigned to lesbian women and gay men congruent with the gender inversion stereotype. Horvath and Ryan (2003) found that lesbian and gay applicants were both perceived as less agentic than heterosexual men but as more agentic than heterosexual women. Gay men have also been perceived as similarly agentic to heterosexual men, but as more communal in other studies (Barrantes & Eaton, 2018; Steffens, Niedlich, Beschorner, & Köhler, 2018). Also, communal men are likely to be perceived as gay and gay men described as communal are perceived as more feminine, suggesting an interplay between communality and femininity when sexual orientation is considered (Kranz, Pröbstle, & Evidis, 2017). Niedlich and Steffens (2015) found that lesbian women were judged as more agentic and communal than heterosexual women (see also Niedlich, Steffens, Krause, Settke, & Ebert, 2015). Other studies found that lesbian women are perceived as equally communal and agentic, but the subgroup of butch lesbian women is seen as more agentic than communal (Brambilla, Carnaghi, & Ravenna, 2011). Moreover, a recent study has demonstrated that gay men were judged less suitable for masculine jobs because they were stereotyped as lacking agency and masculinity (Steffens et al., 2018). Here, we examine both masculinity and femininity, and agency and communion as mediators of discrimination effects. In particular, we test whether stereotyping a candidate along these dimensions would explain biases on leadership suitability judgments. Support for role congruity would occur if LG individuals are stereotyped as gender inverted and such attribution would predict lower leadership suitability for gay men and higher suitability for lesbian women. Support for status beliefs would emerge if candidates, and especially the lesbian women, would be perceived as lacking competence and, in turn, seen as unsuitable for leadership roles.The Present StudiesIn three studies, heterosexual participants heard the voices of female and male job applicants who sounded LG and heterosexual, formed a first impression, rated their suitability as leaders, and ranked them for employability. We will use here sexual orientation terms to refer to perceptions based on vocal cues, rather than accurate detection of speakers’ sexual orientation. In particular, we examined whether voices that conveyed a LG (vs. heterosexual) sexual orientation trigger discrimination. We included rating of a person’s job suitability and rankings of job candidates for overall employability. The former measure refers to the perceived match between the candidate and the role, while the latter measures discrimination directly. Suitability ratings can also mask effects of stereotypes on discrimination more than rankings because judges may compare candidates against different standards more easily on rating measures than on ranking measures (Biernat & Kobrynowicz, 1997). We hypothesized that LG-sounding applicants would be judged less suitable and less employable than heterosexual-sounding applicants overall (the sexual orientation discrimination hypothesis, Hypothesis 1). Our design allowed us to test competing predictions derived from gender inversion theory and role congruity theory vs. status-beliefs theory. Gender inversion theory holds that gay-sounding men bear the brunt of sexual orientation discrimination overall, particularly when (1) gender stereotypes are applied to LG individuals, and (2) the jobs in question clearly demand masculine skills. The role congruity hypothesis therefore predicts that gay-sounding men are discriminated against more than lesbian-sounding women (Hypothesis 2a). In contrast, status beliefs theory holds that lesbian-sounding women bear the brunt of sexual orientation discrimination, particularly when lesbian-sounding women are attributed lower competence by virtue of their double minority status as members of lower status gender and sexuality groups. Hence, the status hypothesis predicts that lesbian-sounding women are discriminated against more than gay-sounding men (Hypothesis 2b). Moreover, in Studies 2 and 3 we tested the additional prediction that LG individuals are kept away from leadership positions because those jobs are perceived as higher status. In Study 2 we used a within-participants design and examined whether the LG applicants are preferentially hired for a low-status (assistantship) rather than a high-status (leadership) position in the same company. Study 3 had a between-participants design that manipulated both job status and job gender role. Hence, Study 3 tested whether job suitability and employability vary depending on the type of job that LG applicants apply for. Study 1In Study 1, we tested the hypothesis that sexual orientation discrimination is prompted by vocal cues (Hypothesis 1). We further tested the role congruity hypothesis that gay male applicants would be targets of sexual orientation discrimination because they are perceived as lacking the masculinity required by leadership roles, while lesbian women would gain an advantage from being perceived as masculine (Hypothesis 2a). Finally, the status belief hypothesis predicts instead that lesbian applicants would be discriminated against more than gay men (Hypothesis 2b).  MethodParticipants \tWe performed a statistical power analysis for sample size estimation using GPower 3.1.9.2 software (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007). With an alpha = .05 and power = .80 projected a sample size needed to collect a medium effect size (ηp2 = 0.06) of 136 participants. One hundred and fifty-six participants took part. We excluded those who failed the manipulation check item as they did not remember correctly the job/company information (n = 19), did not provide final consent to use their data (n = 2), and who self-identified as bisexual (n = 2). The final sample consisted of 67 female and 68 male heterosexual participants (Mage = 36.77, SD = 11.36) who were all British, and English-native speakers. Most held a university degree or a qualification below a degree (n = 100, 75.2%) and politically identified as left (M = 3.40, SD = 1.34; t-test against the midpoint: t[132] = -5.17, p < .001). Fifty-three participants (n = 54, 39.8%) reported experiences in hiring employees, for an average time of three years (M = 2.93, SD = 6.61). Procedure \tParticipants were recruited online through Prolific Academic, a crowdsourcing platform tailored for research, to achieve high quality data (see Peer, Brandimarte, Samat, & Acquisti, 2017). All received £1.50 (approximately USA $2) in exchange for participation. Prolific Academic allows pre-screening for specific demographics. The study was advertised only to individuals who self-identified as British and heterosexual on the platform. After giving consent to participate, participants read the job advertisement and company information. Next, they listened to three female or three male candidates whose voices were presented in a randomized order. Each participant listened to a heterosexual-sounding, a LG-sounding and a filler applicant of the same gender. Participants were told they were listening to the initial part of applicants’ answers to the question of why they were interested in the job, and that only this part of the recording was available for privacy reasons. Next, participants completed the measures presented below and reported demographic information (age, gender, education, experiences and average time in hiring, political affiliation measured on a scale from 1 = extreme left to 7 = extreme right, and sexual orientation measured on a categorical variable with the following options: heterosexual, gay/lesbian, bisexual, other). Finally, participants answered two manipulation check items, assessing memory for the company name and its status. This variable was then used to exclude participants who fail remembering correctly such information. They were thanked, debriefed and asked to provide post-debriefing consent to analyze their data.Materials.Vocal stimuli. Individuals who self-identity as LG and heterosexual were recruited as part of a larger study on voice-based categorization of sexual orientation. Speakers were informed that voice recording would be subsequently used in studies on impression formation and provided full consent for audio recordings used. Twelve male and 18 female speakers were recorded in a sound-proof booth by using a voice recorder while reading out loud texts which were scripted to mimic an applicant applying for a job. Audio files were edited using PRAAT (Boersma & Weenink, 2007) and used in two separate pretests, on female and on male voices. In these pretests, British heterosexual participants (N = 59 in each pretest) listened to 18 female or 12 male speakers and judged their sexual orientation on a scale from 1 (exclusively heterosexual) to 7 (exclusively gay/lesbian) and on a dichotomous choice (heterosexual vs. gay/lesbian). Listeners’ ratings were then examined to select two gay men, two lesbian women, two heterosexual men and two heterosexual- women speakers whose voices was perceived as conveying the sexual orientation they identified with. The two selected lesbian women speakers were perceived as more lesbian-sounding that the two heterosexual women speakers (Mlesbian = 3.80, SD = 1.15 vs. Mheterosexual = 2.68, SD = 1.12, t(58) = 6.87, p < .001; for similar ratings see Sulpizio et al., 2019). Their sexual orientation was also recognized in line with the self-reported sexual orientation (correct responses were above 86.4% for heterosexual women speakers and ranged between 57.6% and 66.1% for lesbian women speakers). Similarly, the selected gay men speakers were perceived as more gay-sounding than the selected heterosexual men speakers (Mgay = 3.97, SD = 1.20 vs. Mheterosexual = 2.68, SD = 1.10, t(58) = 6.31, p < .001; for similar ratings see Sulpizio et al., 2015). Moreover, the sexual orientation of the selected men was categorized most of the time according to the sexual orientation self-reported by the speakers (correct responses were above 89.9% for the heterosexual men speakers and was equal to 57.6% for both gay men speakers). Such categorization responses are in line with previous research showing that heterosexuals speakers are correctly categorized as such most of the time because heterosexuality is taken as the default (see Sulpizio et al., 2015). On the contrary, even when correct, categorization of gay speakers is around 63% (see Rule, 2017) and thus far from being perfect.The speakers read two texts that similarly referred to the candidate’s interest in the job and to their personal skills. The first sentence of each text was used as an audio stimulus; Text 1: I am [Anna/Andrew], I am interested in this job as I believe I have the skills and knowledge that it demands. Text 2: I am [Sophie/Simon] and I am interested in this job. I am a motivated person and I have experience in this field. As done in previous studies (see Haslam & Ryan, 2008), we included a filler applicant who was a weak candidate in order to enhance realism and to avoid making the research aim obvious. Thus, an additional woman and man speaker who sounded heterosexual (Mfiller_woman = 2.75, SD = 1.54; t-test against the midpoint: t(58) = -6.26, p < .001; Mfiller_man = 2.53, SD = 1.56; t-test against the midpoint: t(58) = -7.27, p < .001) were selected from the voice samples used in the pretests. To ensure this candidate was weaker than the other two, we played a sentence where this speaker referred to his/her personality rather than their skills or job interest: “I am [Melanie/Mark]. I am a friendly person and like talking and meeting new people.”Company. We used Haslam and Ryan’s (2008; Study 3) materials. An opening for a director in the financial sector within a manufacturer and office supplies distributor was described in all conditions. The job description indicated that the job required leadership skills (see Supplementary Materials). Company status was manipulated using a fake newspaper article describing the company as either successful or failing in the last ten years. To make status salient, the article included a graph depicting the company’s performance.1  Masculine and feminine traits. Participants rated each candidate on six masculine traits (e.g., dominant, strong; LG: α = .75, heterosexual: α = .83) and six feminine traits (e.g., creative, feminine; LG: α = .74, heterosexual α = .79) used by Fasoli et al. (2017) on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). High scores indicate higher trait attributions.Job suitability. Participants indicated whether each candidate was suitable for the leader position by answering 5 items (e.g., “the candidate would be a good leader”; LG: α = .94, heterosexual: α = .96) on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), (see Haslam & Ryan, 2008). High scores indicated higher suitability.Employability. Participants ranked the three candidates from 1 (the most appointable) to 3 (the least appointable). Ranks were reversed such that high scores indicated employability.Sexual prejudice. Participants completed the 12-item Modern Homonegativity scale (e.g., “gay men and lesbians should stop complaining about the way they are treated in society, and simply get on with their lives”; α = .88) on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree, Morrison & Morrison, 2003). High scores indicated higher prejudice.ResultsPreliminary Analyses Overall participants had low sexual prejudice (M = 3.48, SD = 1.06; t-test against the midpoint of the scale: t(132) = -5.64, p < .001). As predicted, the filler applicant was perceived as not suitable for the leadership position (M = 2.82, SD = 1.30; t-test against midpoint: t[132] = -10.48, p < .001) and far less suitable than all the other candidates: all ts < - 9.66, ps < .001). Only six participants selected this applicant as the most employable. Following Haslam and Ryan (2008), we excluded ratings of this applicant from analyses. In the main analyses, each dependent variable was submitted to a 2 (Candidate Sexual Orientation: gay/lesbian vs. heterosexual) x 2 (Candidate Gender: male vs. female) repeated measures ANOVA where the first factor was a within-participants and the other was between-participants. Pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni correction) were performed to interpret significant interactions. Since analyses including participants’ gender did not show any significant interaction with applicant gender and sexual orientation (Fs < 2.59, p > .11), we report the analyses collapsed across participant gender. Moreover, as suggested by Rosnow and Rosenthal (1995), and more recently by Haans (2018; see also Howell & Lacroix, 2012), to test our theory-driven role congruity and status beliefs hypotheses, planned contrasts were performed. Masculine and Feminine TraitsAnalyses on attribution of masculine and feminine traits were performed separately, since the two indexes were independent (rs < .159, ps > .068). Analysis of attribution of feminine traits showed a main effect of candidate gender, F(1, 131) = 23.65, p < .001, ηp2 = .153, qualified by an interaction with sexual orientation, F(1, 131) = 9.22, p = .003, ηp2 = .066. Feminine traits were similarly attributed to the lesbian-sounding woman (M = 3.41, SD = .91) and the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 3.60, SD = .93; p = .070), but more to the gay-sounding man (M = 2.94, SD = .88) than to the heterosexual-sounding man (M = 2.68, SD = .97; p = .015). The analyses on masculine traits did not show any significant effect or interaction (Fs < 1.09, ps > .299). Leadership SuitabilitySupporting Hypothesis 1, a significant main effect of candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 131) = 4.53, p = .035, ηp2 = .033, indicated that participants discriminated in favor of the heterosexual-sounding applicants (M = 4.25, SD = 1.17) relative to the LG-sounding applicants (M = 3.98, SD = 1.12). The interaction between candidate sexual orientation and gender, F(1, 131) = 2.73, p = .101, ηp2 = .021, was not significant. To test whether the gay- (Hypothesis 2a) or the lesbian-sounding applicants (Hypothesis 2b) bear the brunt of sexual orientation discrimination, planned contrasts were performed within each applicant target gender group. The lesbian-sounding woman (M = 3.78, SD = .96) was rated as less suitable than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 4.24, SD = 1.21; F(1, 131) = 7.09, p = .009), whereas the gay-sounding man (M = 4.18, SD = 1.23) and the heterosexual-sounding man (M = 4.24, SD = 1.21) were rated as similarly suitable (F(1, 131) = .11, p = .74). Hence, in line with Hypothesis 2b, lesbian-sounding candidates bore the brunt of sexual orientation discrimination here. EmployabilityA significant main effect of candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 131) = 4.74, p = .031, ηp2 = .035, indicated that the heterosexual-sounding applicants (M = 2.50, SD = .68) were ranked as more appointable than the LG-sounding candidates (M = 2.28, SD = .59), confirming Hypothesis 1. Also, a significant interaction between candidate sexual orientation and gender emerged, F(1, 131) = 4.12, p = .044, ηp2 = .039. Pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni correction) showed that the lesbian-sounding woman (M = 2.20, SD = .59) was ranked significantly lower than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 2.62, SD = .60; p = .004), whilst the gay-sounding man (M = 2.35, SD = .59) and heterosexual-sounding man (M = 2.37, SD = .73) were ranked similarly (p = .92), as confirmed by planned contrast. Hence, the lesbian-sounding woman experienced more sex-specific discrimination than the gay-sounding man on this ranking measure (see Figure 2).Mediation AnalysesThe effects of candidate gender and sexual orientation on both leadership suitability and employability favour status beliefs theory over gender inversion and role congruity theories both measures showed that sexual orientation discrimination was greater among women than among men. To investigate these theories further, we conducted two mediation analyses to test whether this sexual orientation discrimination was mediated by perceived masculinity and femininity ratings. Montoya and Hayes’ (2017) MEMORE macro for SPSS and bias-corrected intervals (5000 bootstrap resamples), appropriate for a within-participants design and to test indirect effects, was used. None of the indirect effects were significant. The gender inversion stereotyping of candidates did not cause the sexual orientation discrimination observed. DiscussionStudy 1 evidenced discrimination on the basis of vocal cues of sexual orientation in a more egalitarian culture than Italy (see Fasoli et al., 2017), supporting the sexual orientation discrimination hypothesis. The pattern of results on job suitability and employability suggested that discrimination was specific to women targets and independent of the gender inversion stereotyping of candidates. These results favor the status beliefs over the role congruity hypothesis. However, these findings are the first in the gaydar discrimination literature to evidence stronger discrimination amongst women than men, and this pattern was not observed in Fasoli et al.’s (2017) Italian studies. Accordingly, Study 2 tested role congruity and status beliefs explanations again and examined a wider range of trait attributions. Study 1 aimed to replicate previous findings and therefore relied on masculine and feminine traits used by Fasoli et al. (2017). Study 2 moved a step forward and tested whether competency mediates discrimination whilst gender role stereotyping does not, as predicted by status beliefs theory.Study 2Study 2 extended Study 1 in three ways. First, Study 1 did not allow for a direct test of discrimination between gay-sounding vs lesbian-sounding candidates since participants only listened to applicants of the same gender. In reality, gay and lesbian candidates may, of course, compete for the same position. In Study 2, participants heard four applicants; representing the intersection of gender and perceived sexuality. This allowed us to test the main sexual orientation hypothesis (Hypothesis 1) along with the role congruity (Hypothesis 2a) and beliefs status (Hypothesis 2b) predictions. Second, the participants rated the candidates on a greater range of traits. Candidates were rated on masculinity and femininity, and also on competence, sociability, and morality. Ratings of masculinity and femininity have been found to predict sexual orientation discrimination (Fasoli et al., 2017). Competence and sociability resemble agency and communion that predict leadership suitability for typically masculine and feminine type of jobs, respectively (see Barrantes & Eaton, 2018; Steffens et al., 2018). Morality is relevant to group status (Ellemers, Pagliaro, Barreto, & Leach, 2008), is associated with sexuality (Herek & McLemore, 2013), and predicts first impressions that inform hiring recommendations (Brambilla, Sacchi, Rusconi, Cherubini, & Yzerbyt, 2012; Cunningham, Sartore, & McCullough, 2010). These attributions allowed us to further test support for role congruity and status belief predictions and explore the alternative that discrimination is mediated by attributions of morality. Third, in Study 2, applicants were rated as suitable for a high-status leadership position (manager), and for a lower-status position as that manager’s assistant. Assigning LG-sounding candidates to the assistant position could resolve the dilemma between keeping LG-sounding candidates out of leadership positions, whilst conforming to a new social norm to treat LG people fairly (Merritt, Effron & Monin, 2010). We predicted that LG-sounding applicants would be preferred for the low-status assistant position than heterosexual-sounding applicants (Hypothesis 3). MethodParticipantsA statistical power analysis was performed for sample size estimation using GPower 3.1.9.2 software (Faul et al., 2007). With an alpha = .05 and power = .80 the projected sample size needed to collect a medium effect size (ηp2 = 0.06) was 33 participants. Eighty-two participants participated, but two did not provide consent for their data use. The final sample included 80 heterosexual participants (37 women, 43 men, Mage = 37.75, SD = 13.22). All were British. All but one were native English speakers. Most had a University degree or a qualification below a degree (73.8%, n = 59), and politically identified as left (M = 3.55, SD = 1.25; t[79] = -2.98, p = .004). Also, 43.8% (n = 35) reported experiences in recruitment for an average of 7 years (M = 7.06, SD = 8.37). ProcedureParticipants were recruited via Prolific Academic and received £1.50 (approx. USA$2) as before. They were informed that a company was hiring a leader and listened to voices of a lesbian-sounding woman, gay-sounding man, a heterosexual-sounding man and a heterosexual-sounding woman in a randomized order. After listening to each applicant, participants rated them for masculinity, femininity, competence, sociability, morality, leadership suitability, low-status occupation suitability, and completed the employability rankings. Next, they reported beliefs in leadership consequences and in beliefs about equality, and demographics. Finally, they were thanked, debriefed and provided final consent to data use. Materials Job ad and vocal stimuli. Job ad was the same as in Study 1, except that participants were only informed about the type of position the company was advertising. The speakers were the same as in Study 1 except for the fact that the filler candidate was not included. Also, participants heard shorter utterances here (i.e., “I am [name] and I am interested in this job”). As part of the cover story, they were informed that for privacy reasons they were not allowed to hear the full interview.Masculinity and femininity. Participants rated candidates on two traits (i.e. masculine and feminine) on scales ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). These two items were negatively correlated for all targets (r ranging from -.31 to -.45) except for the heterosexual woman (r = .03). As these correlations varied by target, we considered them separately. Higher scores indicated higher masculinity and femininity attributions, respectively. Competence, sociability, and morality. Participants rated each candidate on nine traits representing three constructs; competence (competent, intelligent, skilled; α from .88 to .93 by target), sociability (likable, warm, friendly; α from .87 to .93 by target) and morality (honest, sincere, trustworthy; α from .83 to .92 by target; see Brambilla et al., 2012). Participants answered the items on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). High scores indicated higher trait attributions.Leadership suitability. Participants indicated candidates’ suitability for the leadership position using the same five items and rating scale used in Study 1 (α ranging from .96 to .97 by target). Low-status occupation suitability. A single item asked whether the applicant would have been better suited to a low-status position (i.e., “The candidate would only be suitable for a non-leadership position [e.g., assistant]”) on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).Leadership employability. Participants ranked the four candidates from 1 (the most appointable) to 4 (the least appointable) as in Study 1. Ranks were reversed as before.Beliefs in leadership consequences. A 16-item measure of beliefs in the good leadership of two groups, women and LG people, was based on O’Brien and Vest (1988). Eight items referred to each target group but were otherwise identical (e.g., “I believe employing a woman [homosexual person] as a leader will bring diversity into the company”). Participants answered on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Reliability for scores on the beliefs in good leadership consequences was estimated at α = .73 for women and α = .76 for LG people target, and an index was calculated by averaging the relevant eight items. Higher score indicated positive beliefs about each group.Beliefs about equality. Two 3-item scales, adapted from Horvath and Ryan (2003), measured support for equality in hiring in regard to gender and to sexual orientation (e.g., “Refusing to hire someone because of his/her [gender/sexual orientation] is wrong”). Reliability for scores on beliefs about equality was estimated at α = .96 for gender and α = .93 for sexual orientation; items were averaged so that a higher score indicated higher support for equality.ResultsPreliminary ResultsT-tests against the scale midpoint suggested that participants did not believe that good consequences would occur in a company because of having women (M = 2.46, SD = .77; t(79) = -17.80, p < .001) and LG leaders (M = 3.17, SD = .98; t(79) = -7.52, p < .001). However, they strongly supported gender (M = 6.57, SD = .91; t(79) = 25.24, p < .001) and sexual orientation equality (M = 6.59, SD = .90; t(79) = 25.71, p < .001). In the main analyses, a 2 (Candidate Sexual Orientation: gay/lesbian vs. heterosexual) x 2 (Candidate Gender: male vs. female) repeated measures ANOVA was conducted on each of the dependent variables. Pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni correction) were conducted when interactions were significant. Analyses including participant gender as a factor did not show any significant interaction with the candidate gender and/or sexual orientation on the dependent variables (Fs < 1.17, p > .28). We therefore report the data collapsed across participant gender. As in Study 1, planned contrasts were performed to test our theory-driven hypotheses (Haans, 2018; Howell & Lacroix, 2012). In this case, the design allowed us to conduct contrasts examining whether the gay- (Hypothesis 2a) or the lesbian-sounding (Hypothesis 2b) candidate were the most discriminated against among all the candidates. Masculinity and FemininityResults on masculinity showed a significant interaction between candidate gender and sexual orientation, F(1, 79) = 4.12, p = .049, ήp2 = .050. The gay-sounding man (M = 5.38, SD = 1.49) and the heterosexual-sounding man (M = 5.35, SD = 1.46; p = .89) were perceived as similarly masculine. In contrast, the lesbian-sounding woman (M = 2.31, SD = 1.63) was perceived as more masculine than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 1.80, SD = 1.20; p = .004). The same analysis performed on femininity also yielded a significant interaction, F(1, 79) = 14.44, p < .001, ήp2 = .155. Again, the gay-sounding (M = 1.95, SD = 1.34) and heterosexual-sounding man (M = 1.96, SD = 1.50; p = .941) were perceived similarly, whereas the lesbian-sounding woman (M = 5.11, SD = 1.61) was perceived as significantly less feminine than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 6.06, SD = 1.25; p < .001). Thus, gender inverted attribution emerged for the female candidates only in Study 2.CompetenceAnalysis yielded a significant main effect of candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 79) = 21.69. p < .001, ήp2 = .215. This was qualified by a significant interaction with candidate gender, F(1, 79) = 4.75, p = .032, ήp2 = .057. The gay-sounding man (M = 4.16, SD = 1.14) was perceived as less competent that the heterosexual-sounding man (M = 4.47, SD = .99; p = .039). The lesbian-sounding woman (M = 3.99, SD = 1.12) was perceived as less competent than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 4.75, SD = .99; p < .001). The gay-sounding and the lesbian-sounding applicant were perceived as similarly competent (p = .290), but the heterosexual-sounding woman was rated as more competent than the heterosexual-sounding man (p = .024).  SociabilityA significant main effect of candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 79) = 43.94. p < .001, ήp2 = .357, was qualified by a significant interaction with candidate gender, F(1, 79) = 21.85, p < .001, ήp2 = .217. The gay-sounding man (M = 4.34, SD = 1.26) was rated as similarly sociable as the heterosexual-sounding man (M = 4.60, SD = 1.07; p = .089), but the lesbian-sounding woman (M = 3.72, SD = 1.16) was rated as less sociable than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 5.09, SD = 1.15; p < .001). The gay-sounding man was also rated as more sociable than the lesbian-sounding woman (p = .001) and the heterosexual-sounding woman as more sociable than the heterosexual-sounding man (p = .001). MoralityA significant main effect of candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 79) = 28.69. p < .001, ήp2 = .27, was qualified by a significant interaction with gender, F(1, 79) = 9.60, p = .003, ήp2 = .108. The gay-sounding man (M = 4.26, SD = 1.05) was perceived as significantly less moral than the heterosexual-sounding man (M = 4.55, SD = 1.03; p = .046), and the lesbian-sounding woman (M = 3.89, SD = 1.13) as less moral than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 4.79, SD = 1.04; p < .001). Also, the lesbian-sounding woman was perceived as less moral than the gay-sounding man (p = .015), whilst the heterosexual-sounding woman was judged as more moral than the heterosexual-sounding man (p = .039). Hence, sexual orientation affected morality attributions for all candidates, but more so for women than for men.Leadership SuitabilityA significant main effect of candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 79) = 18.48, p < .001, ήp2 = .190, indicated that participants discriminated in favour of heterosexual-sounding (M = 4.49 , SE = .10) over LG-sounding applicants (M = 3.94, SE = .10), replicating Study 1 and supporting Hypothesis 1. The interaction between candidate sexual orientation and gender fell short of significance, F(1, 79) = 3.15, p = .080, ήp2 = .038 (Mlesbian  = 3.78, SD = 1.19 vs. Mgay  = 4.10, SD = 1.12 vs. Mstraigth_woman  = 4.54, SD = 1.04 vs. Mstright_man  = 4.42, SD = 1.03). Planned contrast testing the role congruity (coded as -1 = lesbian, 3 = gay, − 1 = heterosexual women, − 1 = heterosexual men) and the status beliefs (coded as 3 = lesbian, − 1 = gay, − 1 = heterosexual women, − 1 = heterosexual men) hypotheses were carried out. No significant difference occurred between the gay-sounding man and the other candidates, F(1, 79) = 1.03, p = .31. On the contrary, the lesbian-sounding woman was rated as the least suitable candidates compared to the others, F(1, 79) = 14.87, p < .001) supporting the status beliefs hypothesis (Hypothesis 2b). Leadership EmployabilityOnly a main effect of candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 78) = 21.41, p < .001, ήp2 = .213, was found. Confirming Hypothesis 1, LG-sounding applicants were ranked as less appointable (M = 2.18, SD = .61) than heterosexual-sounding applicants (M = 2.82, SD = .62; see Figure 2). No other significant effects were found (Fs < .41, ps > .525). Planned contrasts showed that the lesbian-sounding applicants were the least preferred, F(1, 79) = 40.79, p < .001, followed by the gay-sounding applicants, F(1, 79) = 4.69, p = .033. Low-status Occupation SuitabilityConfirming Hypothesis 3, we found a significant effect for sexual orientation discrimination, F(1, 79) = 6.32, p = .014, ήp2 = .074. LG-sounding applicants (M = 3.86, SD = 1.09) were rated as better candidates for the low-status position than heterosexual-sounding applicants (M = 3.54, SD = 1.09). No other significant effects were found (Fs < .54, ps > .46).Mediation AnalysesAs in Study 1 mediation analyses employed MEMORE macro. We investigated perceived femininity, masculinity, competence, warmth, and morality as potential mediators of sexual orientation discrimination separately for each gender. The analyses of discrimination among women supported full mediation. The direct effect of perceived sexual orientation on job suitability (b = -.75, SE = .18, t = -4.27, p < .001) became non-significant (b = -.15, SE = .14, t = -1.04, p = .302). Confirming the mediated path, the indirect effects through competence (a∗b = -.39, SE = .15, 95% CI [-0.75, -0.15] z = -2.92, p = .003) and morality (a∗b = -.56, SE = .18, 95% CI [-0.98, -0.28]) were statistically significant. The same analysis on male candidates showed only a small indirect effect via competence (a∗b = -.18, SE = .09, 95% CI [-0.41, -0.03]). Mediation analyses on employability similarly showed that the perceived competence completely mediated sexual orientation discrimination among men (a∗b = -.14, SE = .09, 95% CI [-0.37, -0.006]) and among women (a∗b = -.40, SE = .22, 95% CI [-0.87,-0.001]). Across all four models, competence was the single most consistent mediator of sexual orientation discrimination. In addition, attributions of morality were relevant to the lower leadership suitability ratings of lesbian-sounding women (see Figure 3 and 4). Discussion Study 2 replicated the finding of discrimination based on sexual orientation conveyed by voice. Again, lesbian- and gay-sounding applicants were discriminated against heterosexual-sounding participants. Whilst lesbian-sounding women were stereotyped as more masculine here, in line with the gender inversion stereotype, heterosexual-sounding women were attributed greater competence, and competence emerged as the key mediator of sexual orientation discrimination, not masculinity. Like Study 1, Study 2 refutes the idea that gender inversion stereotyping triggered by vocal cues of sexual orientation would create an advantage for lesbian-sounding women via attributions of greater masculinity (see also Fasoli et al., 2017). Instead, the lesbian-sounding applicants were perceived as less suitable for leadership than gay-sounding applicants, supporting the status beliefs hypothesis. In Study 2, participants rated suitability for the lower status job after considering candidates for the higher status job. LG-sounding candidates were perceived as better suited to a low-status assistantship position, suggesting a “compensatory” strategy. By giving LG-sounding candidates the assistantship position, participants could avoid the self-perception that their choices are prejudicial, whilst maintaining status hierarchies in candidate choices. This interpretation is tentative, and it is possible that this compensatory strategy is applied only after high-status jobs are assigned. Accordingly, Study 3 tested both our core hypotheses, and experimentally manipulated job status and gender role in a between-participants design. Study 3Both Studies 1 and 2 favor status beliefs over role congruity explanations of sexual orientation discrimination prompted by vocal cues of sexual orientation. Study 3 aimed to replicate the sexual orientation discrimination (Hypothesis 1) and the status beliefs (Hypothesis 2b) effects that the lesbian-sounding woman would bear the brunt of discrimination. Study 3 also explored whether the type of job role could affect participants’ judgments. The results of Study 2 drove our decision to manipulate job status. We predicted that the LG-sounding applicants would be perceived as less suitable and appointable for a high-status job but not for a low-status job, to the extent that LG-sounding individuals are perceived as less competent (Hypothesis 3). At the same type, we manipulated whether the job role was typically masculine or feminine. Gay men have been preferentially hired for feminine leadership roles in some studies (Barrantes & Eaton; 2018; but see Niedlich & Steffens, 2015), but none have used voice as a cue for sexual orientation, and different cues to sexual orientation may impact the form of discrimination that occurs (Hegarty & Massey, 2006). In line with role congruity theory, we predict that gay-sounding men are preferred for feminine jobs and lesbian-sounding women for masculine jobs, to the extent that gender inversion stereotypes are activated, and allow a role fit with the relevant job (Hypothesis 4). Manipulation of job status was independent of job gender role avoiding possible confounds between the status and perceived masculinity of occupational roles (Hegewish, Liepmann, Hayes, & Hartmann, 2010). MethodParticipants We performed a statistical power analysis for sample size estimation using GPower 3.1.9.2 software (Faul et al., 2007). With an alpha = .05 and power = .80 the projected sample size needed to collect a medium effect size (ηp2 = 0.06) was 116 participants. One hundred and twenty-nine participants took part in the study. We excluded two bisexual participants, leaving 127 heterosexual participants (62 women, 65 men, Mage = 37.59, SD = 12.77). All were British and native speakers, most held a university/college degree (53%, n = 68), most identified politically as left (M = 3.60, SD = 1.24, t-test against the midpoint t[126] = -3.64, p < .001), and had no hiring experience (65%, n = 83). Procedure\tProcedure and measures were the same as in Study 2, except for the job descriptions illustrated below and the corresponding manipulation check items. Beliefs in leadership consequence measure was dropped. As in Study 2, participants listened to the four candidates but the type of job they applied for varied depending on the experimental condition.MaterialsJob advertisement and manipulation check. Participants read one of four job ads manipulated to either describe a typically masculine or feminine job that was also either high or low in status job. The job title, its permanence, and its London location were kept constant. The masculine job was a “Competition Advisor”, the feminine job was a “Social Support Advisor” (see Barrantes & Eaton, 2018). To emphasize gender typicality the jobs’ “required skills” (as in Study 1 and 2) were either task-oriented (i.e., “Manager capable of setting challenging targets and of developing practical actions to meet them”; “Manager capable of planning activities and competition strategies.”) or relationship-oriented skills (i.e., “Manager capable of understanding of what the team needs to improve teamwork”, “Manager with  excellent communication and interpersonal skills”). Gender Decoder for Job Ads (n.d.) showed that both ads contained only gender-consistent words. The high-status position was advertised as an “advisor” (as in Barrantes & Eaton, 2018), with a salary of £50,000 (approximately $65,000), whilst the low status position was “Assistant to the Advisor” with a salary of £25,000 (approximately $32,000). The average UK salary is £27,271 (Office for National Statistics, 2017). The description of the low-status position stressed its subordinate role (i.e., “The assistant will NOT make decisions but will perform tasks assigned by the manager. The assistant will need to be available all the time, and have a flexible and adaptable approach to work”). The required skills also referred to assisting and varied appropriate to the gender role of the job (i.e., masculine: “Assistant facilitating the manager’s activities in setting challenging targets”; “Assistant capable of organizing the manager’s activities and appointments” and feminine: “Assistant facilitating the manager’s activities to improve teamwork and employees’ needs”; “Assistant with excellent communication and interpersonal people skills”). Two manipulation check items referring to the job gender role (i.e., how much do you think this job is masculine/feminine?”; from 1 [very feminine] to 7 [very masculine]), and job status (i.e., “How much do you think this position is a low or high status job?”; from 1 [low status] to 7 [high status] were included at the end of the study.ResultsPreliminary AnalysesAs in Study 2, overall, participants reported high support for gender (M = 6.60, SD = .71, t-test against the midpoint t[126] = 41.04, p < .001) and sexual orientation equality (M = 6.62, SD = .71, t-test against the midpoint t[126] = 41.59, p < .001). Hence, the participants were supportive of equality in the workplace.We further examined how the job was perceived by considering ratings on the two manipulation check items. A 2 (job status: low vs. high) x 2 (job role: masculine vs. feminine) univariate ANOVA was first performed on ratings of perceived job masculinity. The masculine job (M = 4.24, SD = .89) was rated as more masculine than the feminine job (M = 3.52, SD = .68, F(1, 123) = 276.95, p < .001, ήp2 = .18). This effect was qualified by a significant interaction with status, F(1, 123) = 9.05, p = .003, ήp2 = .07. The high-status masculine job (M = 4.56, SD = .82) was perceived as more masculine than the low-status masculine job (M = 3.91, SD = .84; p = .001). No difference between high- and low-status feminine jobs emerged; they were perceived as similarly feminine (Mlow-stauts = 3.60, SD = .67 and Mhigh-status = 3.43, SD = .68; p = .40). The same analysis was performed on the perceived job status item. The assistant position (M = 4.03, SD = 1.19) was rated as lower status than the leadership position (M = 5.05, SD = 1.04; F(1, 123) = 27.39, p < .001, ήp2 = .18). In addition, the masculine jobs (M = 4.82, SD = 1.28) were attributed higher status than feminine jobs (M = 4.23, SD = 1.09; F(1, 123) = 8.97, p = .003, ήp2 = .07). No significant interaction emerged (F < 1). Hence, gender role and status were manipulated successfully, whilst the high-status masculine position was perceived as particularly masculine, and masculine jobs were perceived as particularly high status.In the main analyses, a 2 (Candidate Sexual orientation: gay/lesbian vs. heterosexual) x 2 (Candidate Gender: male vs. female) x 2 (Type of job: masculine vs. feminine) x 2 (Job status: high vs. low) ANOVA was performed on each dependent variable. The first two variables were within-participants and the last two variables were between-participants factors. Pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni correction) were performed in case of significant interactions. Analyses performed including participant gender as a factor did not affect the main pattern of results2. Planned contrasts tested our theory-driven status beliefs and role congruity hypotheses as in Study 2.Job SuitabilityA main effect of candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 123) = 55.47, p < .001, ήp2 = .311, indicated that LG-sounding applicants (M = 3.76, SD = .95) were rated as less suitable than heterosexual-sounding applicants (M = 4.24, SD = 1.25), confirming Hypothesis 1, and replicating Studies 1 and 2. Sexual orientation discrimination was qualified by an interaction with gender, F(1, 123) = 21.18, p < .001, ήp2 = .147. As in both earlier studies, sexual orientation discrimination was greater among women. The lesbian-sounding woman (M = 3.50, SD = 1.27) was rated as less suitable than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 4.75, SD = 1.14; p < .001), whereas the gay-sounding man (M = 4.02, SD = 1.24) and heterosexual-sounding man (M = 4.24, SD = 1.25; p = .135) were deemed equally suitable. The lesbian-sounding woman was rated as less suitable than the gay-sounding man (p = .001), while the heterosexual-sounding woman was rated as more suitable than the heterosexual-sounding man (p < .001). Planned contrast further confirmed that the lesbian-sounding woman, F(1, 126) = 7.19, p = .008, but not the gay-sounding man, F(1, 126) = 1.76, p = .19, was perceived as the least suitable among all the candidates for any of the jobs under consideration.All the other effects or interactions were not significant (Fs < 2.36, ps > .127). This support for Hypotheses 1 and 2 was robust across masculine and feminine jobs of high and low status, disconfirming Hypotheses 3 and 4. EmployabilityA main effect of candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 123) = 10.13, p = .002, ήp2 = .076, showed that heterosexual-sounding applicants were ranked higher (M = 2.71, SD = .72) than the LG-sounding applicants (M = 2.30, SD = .72), confirming Hypothesis 1. The interaction with candidate gender, F(1, 123) = 3.78, p = .054, ήp2 = .030, fell short of significance (Mlesbian  = 2.23, SD = 1.16 vs. Mgay  = 2.37, SD = 1.05 vs. Mstraigth_woman  = 2.88, SD = 1.11 vs. Mstright_man  = 2.53, SD = 1.04). Planned contrast showed support for the status beliefs hypothesis (Hypothesis 2b) since the lesbian-sounding woman, F(1, 126) = 7.19, p = .008) was significantly less appointable than the other candidates while the gay-sounding man was not significantly less appointable than the others,  F(1, 126) = 2.05, p = .155 (see Figure 2). The ANOVA did not yield any other significant main effects or interactions (Fs < 3.51, ps > .06).Masculinity and FemininityA significant interaction between candidate gender and sexual orientation, F(1, 126) = 19.91, p < .001, ήp2 = .136, on perceived masculinity showed that the gender inversion stereotype was activated here. The gay-sounding man (M = 5.21, SD = 1.44) was perceived as less masculine than the heterosexual-sounding man (M = 5.63, SD = 1.17; p = .002), and the lesbian-sounding woman (M = 2.12, SD = 1.26) was perceived as more masculine than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 1.64, SD = 1.07; p < .001). A similar interaction emerged on perceived femininity, F(1, 126) = 35.90, p < .001, ήp2 = .222. The gay-sounding man (M = 1.93, SD = 1.25) was perceived as more feminine than the heterosexual-sounding man (M = 1.69, SD = 1.00; p = .056), whereas the lesbian-sounding woman (M = 5.28, SD = 1.41) was perceived as less feminine than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 6.14, SD = 1.14; p < .001). In contrast to Study 1 and 2, all ratings confirmed the gender inversion stereotype here. CompetenceA significant main effect of candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 123) = 49.26, p < .001, ήp2 = .286 was observed, replicating Study 2. This effect was qualified by a significant interaction with candidate gender, F(1, 123) = 23.54, p < .001, ήp2 = .161. The gay-sounding man (M = 4.21, SD = 1.02) was perceived as less competent than the heterosexual-sounding man (M = 4.40, SD = 1.06; p = .078), and the lesbian-sounding (M = 3.83, SD = 1.05) was perceived as less competent than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 4.79, SD = 1.04; p < .001). Moreover, the lesbian-sounding applicant was perceived as less competent than the gay-sounding applicant (p = .001), and the heterosexual-sounding woman as more competent than the heterosexual-sounding man (p = .001). No other significant effects were found (Fs < 1.71, ps > .193), showing that these effects were not particular to a job’s gender role or status. Once again lower competence was attributed to gay- and especially lesbian-sounding applicants, contrary to gender inversion theory predictions.SociabilityA significant main effect of candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 123) = 84.37, p < .001, ήp2 = .407, was qualified by a significant interaction with candidate gender, F(1, 123) = 67.69, p < .001, ήp2 = .355. Participants judged the gay- (M = 4.13, SD = 1.13) and heterosexual-sounding man (M = 4.25, SD = 1.12) as similarly sociable (p = .319), and the lesbian-sounding woman (M = 3.42, SD = 1.21) as less sociable than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 5.10, SD = 1.13; p < .001). The lesbian-sounding applicant was also attributed to be less sociable than the gay-sounding man (p < .001), and the heterosexual-sounding woman as more sociable than the heterosexual-sounding man (p < .001).  No other significant effects were found (Fs < 1.74, ps > .190). Once again, stereotyping occurred on this dimension only for the female candidates.MoralityA significant main effect of the candidate sexual orientation, F(1, 123) = 52.28, p < .001, ήp2 = .298, was qualified by an interaction with candidate gender, F(1, 123) = 26.49, p < .001, ήp2 = .177. The gay-sounding man (M = 4.19, SD = 1.04) was rated as equally moral as the heterosexual-sounding man (M = 4.38, SD = 1.04; p = .096), whereas the lesbian-sounding woman (M = 3.78, SD = 1.09) was rated as clearly less moral than the heterosexual-sounding woman (M = 4.83, SD = 1.04; p < .001). The lesbian-sounding woman was rated as less moral than the gay-sounding man (p = .001), and the heterosexual-sounding woman as more moral than the heterosexual-sounding man (p < .001). No other significant effects were found (Fs < 2.21, ps > .139).Mediation AnalysesThe mediation analyses in Study 2 were replicated here to test the impact of femininity, masculinity, competence, sociability, and morality in mediating sexual orientation discrimination on the job suitability and employability measures. A significant indirect effect of perceived sexual orientation of female applicants via perceived competence was found on job suitability (a∗b = -.74, SE = .16, 95% CI [-1.06, -0.43]) and employability (a∗b = -.18, SE = .08, 95% CI [-.35, -0.05]), as predicted by status beliefs theory (see Figure 5). No direct or indirect effects were found for job suitability and employability of male candidates.DiscussionStudy 3 re-confirmed that vocal cues to sexual orientation prompt discrimination, particularly against women targets, in support of status beliefs theory rather than role congruity theory. Discrimination among women was also mediated by attributions of lower competence, as status beliefs theory would predict. In this study we did not find support for the role congruity theory. Whilst gender inversion stereotypes were clearly applied to all applicants, when lesbian-sounding women were stereotyped as masculine they were seen as less suitable and less employable candidates for any job regardless of its specificity. Hence, gender inversion stereotypes did not facilitate the fit with masculine or feminine jobs. Finally, in Study 3, we did not find support for Hypothesis 3: LG-sounding applicants were not preferred for a low-status position. This suggests that the preference to hire LG-sounding candidates in Study 2 only may have been a compensatory strategy, specific to contexts in which low-status jobs are assigned after high-status jobs have been assigned, as in Study 2, but not here. General DiscussionIn the UK, LGBT equality is increasingly the social norm (ILGA Europe, 2018), and our heterosexual participants explicitly supported sexual orientation and gender equality at work. Yet, vocal cues to sexual orientation still prompted discrimination in heterosexual individuals, most particularly against lesbian-sounding applicants. Across Studies 1-3, lesbian-sounding women were rated as less suitable for the jobs and ranked significantly lower than heterosexual-sounding women and other job candidates in employability (see Figure 1). This work responds to the call for gaydar research in the context of leadership (Barrantes & Eaton, 2018) and extends research on gaydar’s social costs (Fasoli & Maass, 2018). So far, research on categorization of sexual orientation (gaydar) mostly focused on the accuracy of such gaydar judgments, and more studies examine gaydar in regard to male than female targets (Rule, 2017). Discrimination studies have found gender-neutral sexual orientation discrimination effects (Fasoli et al., 2017), consistent beliefs about the gay but not about the lesbian voice (Barton, 2015), and that men, more than women, believe their voices communicate their sexual orientation (Fasoli, Hegarty, Maass, & Antonio, 2018). This work adds to our understanding of the intersection of gender and sexual orientation discrimination, by clearly supporting status beliefs theory over role congruity theory. Most importantly, lesbian-sounding women consistently bore the brunt of discrimination more than gay-sounding men. In addition, attributions of stereotypical masculinity to lesbian-sounding women, which role theory suggests will advantage lesbians, were shown in mediation models to be irrelevant to discrimination. Status beliefs theory fared much better, because the consistent mediator of discrimination effects across studies, groups, and measures was competency. When applicants sound gay – or particularly, sound lesbian – they risk being considered incompetent and consequently considered less suitable for higher-status leadership positions (see also Berger et al., 1997; Ridgeway, 2001). These findings also speak to modern prejudice in countries like the UK where sexual orientation equality is increasingly a social norm. In such contexts, heterosexual judges must navigate the dilemmas created between their beliefs that lesbian women and gay men may be ill-suited to certain roles, and the demand to treat them fairly. UK employers are aware of law that protects women and sexual minorities from discrimination, but discrimination prompted by subtle cues such as vocal cues of sexual orientation may still easily escape their scrutiny. Indeed, discrimination occurred when sexual orientation was inferred rather than explicitly disclosed. Hence, everyone who sounds LG is at risk of discrimination in the hiring context, regardless of how the person identifies (see Fasoli et al., 2017). Moreover, the discrimination observed here would not only reflect beliefs about status hierarchies along sexual orientation lines, but the outcomes of these hiring decisions would also enhance sexual orientation hierarchy in intersection with gender hierarchies. Some patterns in these results suggest self-licencing strategies for modern prejudice. Self-licencing is described as the tendency to act in a way that appears fair and maintains individuals’ moral standards, but at the same time frees them up to be biased (Merritt et al., 2010). Such strategies are common in ambiguous situations, as when sexual orientation is not explicitly disclosed. We found preferential hiring of LG-sounding candidates to the low status assistantship in Study 2 after a higher status leadership position had been assigned preferentially to heterosexual-sounding candidates but not when job status was manipulated between participants (Study 3). Hence, indicating that LG-sounding applicants were more suitable for a low-status role may have allowed our participants to gain back some “moral credentials” such that they were not discriminating but simply indicating a preference.Across studies, lesbian-sounding women were consistently ranked below heterosexual-sounding women and men candidates, but heterosexual-sounding women were ranked higher or perceived as more suitable than lesbian-sounding women and men candidates across studies. Interpretations of this preference for heterosexual-sounding women are post-hoc and tentative by necessity. A positive bias toward heterosexual women could occur because target stimuli in different combinations can suggest the implicit norms against which they are to be compared and the salient similarities and differences between them (Tversky, 1977). For example, lower implicit minimum standards may be in place for women than for men, due to group stereotypes, ironically leading more positive ratings to emerge for women than men candidates when individual women are compared against a lower standard than individual men are (see Biernat & Kobrynowicz, 1997; Biernat & Manis, 1994). A heterosexual woman candidate lacking masculine attributes can be perceived as brave and motivated to get a top job, leading to a positive evaluation of her (see Heilman, Martell, & Simon, 1988). However, as we observed that heterosexual-sounding women were also rated the best candidate on ranking measures where such effects of “shifting standards” are not observed, a more plausible cognitive explanation is that our designs made the higher status sexual orientation of heterosexual-sounding targets more salient than is usual. Such “unmarked” higher status identities are rarely conceptualized explicitly before lower status “marked” identities are first conceptualized (c.f., Hegarty, 2017). On its own, such a cognitive process does not explain why heterosexual women might be particularly advantaged. Yet, self-licensing could explain this unexpected result. Crow, Fok, and Hartman (1998) analyzed hiring discrimination at the intersection between gender, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. These authors found that, while the least preferred candidates were Black LGs, the most preferred candidate was the White heterosexual woman. Individuals feel accountable for their decisions (see Koch, D’Mello, & Sackett, 2015). Hence, having rated candidates with several lower status identities poorly, participants may boost their rating of heterosexual woman candidate with only one low status identity to “license” their discrimination against LG targets as somewhat more moral and fair (see Monin & Miller, 2001). We acknowledge that future research is needed to investigate the cognitive and motivational processes described here. It is telling that the vocal cues of sexual orientation prompted discriminatory judgments, but not explicit attributions to sexual orientation discrimination. Jointly these studies help to describe how a woman who sounds lesbian can become a lever for the exercise of power that can maintain status hierarchies. Modern prejudiced beliefs encode the ideas that lesbian women and gay men are advantaged by “special rights” and that they continue to complain about inequality in ways that are out of synch with modern society (Morrison & Morrison, 2003. Here the discrimination prompted by the same subtle vocal cues of sexual orientation demonstrates how sexual orientation remains a hierarchical category, in which people are often assumed heterosexual until explicit or implicit cues suggest otherwise (Lick & Johnson, 2016). Discrimination may occur in the workplace both when LG individuals come out, and when they are “outed” by cues of sexual orientation. In the latter situation, as we have shown here, women who are perceived as lesbian are likely to be target of sexual orientation discrimination simply because their voices signal a lesbian sexual orientation. However, they may fail to attribute such discrimination to their sexual orientation since sexual orientation is only inferred and not explicitly disclosed.. As such our results suggest that vocal cues of sexual orientation may create patterns of intersectional invisibility for lesbian women in the UK (Purdie-Vaughns & Eibach, 2008). Lesbian women in the UK would experience intersectional invisibility if their voices cue stereotypes of incompetence leading to discrimination. The concept of intersectional invisibility, developed a propos of African-American women, provides a useful way to theorize the disparities between the reality of intersectional discrimination, and the attributions that are made about it (see Purdie-Vaughns & Eibach, 2008). Practice ImplicationsThese studies have practical implications for individuals, companies and legal systems that would wish to attenuate the extent to which sexual orientation is a marker of status is societies where equality is the norm. As a matter of fact, legal cases have already been adjudicated in which “gay accent” has been taken into consideration to examine whether instances of discrimination based on perceived sexual orientation exist (see Castle, 2012). The difficulties in such cases are multiple. On the one hand, it is complicated to prove discrimination when sexuality is not explicitly disclosed but rather cued by voice or other behaviors. On the other hand, federal courts have difficulties in differentiating between gender and sexual orientation discrimination when cues of sexuality and gender stereotypes are mixed. Castle (2012) argues for the importance of research on what they called gay accent for legal procedures. The importance of examining cues of sexual orientation it is also evidenced by research showing that gay employees wage gap is explained by inferred sexual orientation rather than the actual, disclosed, sexual orientation (see Laurent & Mihoubi, 2016). Hence, discrimination is different among gay employees depending on cues of sexual orientation. We are slow to recommend to individuals that they do or do not modify their voices in high-status employment contexts, mindful of both the cognitive load that this may incur, and of how withdrawal from social situations and hiding sexual orientation are mechanisms that allow minority stress to get “under the skin” of LGB individuals (Hatzenbuehler, 2009, p. 707). Rather, these findings should be used to make explicit in unconscious bias training that subtle cues to identity can prompt discrimination to a greater extent than either job applicants or recruiters may detect, and to develop mechanisms for managing such threats to equality. One possibility could be to develop artificial intelligence platforms to tune the voice with the aim of making all voices sound gender and sexual orientation neutral decreasing biases that may occur in the hiring process.Limitations and Future DirectionsSeveral limitations to the current studies suggest further directions for research. First, we only examined vocal cues of sexual orientation here. Previous studies have found vocal cue discrimination to be stronger than visual gaydar (see Fasoli et al., 2017) but visual cues are also available as grounds for discrimination in the hiring process (Rule et al., 2016). Moreover, individuals have been more accurate in judging sexual orientation of women than men when face was concerned (Brewer & Lyons, 2016), hence it will be important to investigate whether exposure to multiple cues lead to similar results. Also, we have not examined yet the interplay between disclosure and “subtle” cues to sexual orientation, but findings suggest that incongruent information can lead to stronger stigmatization (see Gowen & Britt, 2006). Second, Study 2 suggests the merit of teasing apart judgments of sociability and morality, because morality – but not sociability – emerged as a predictor of discrimination judgments. In the United States, LG individuals are perceived as falling short of moral values grounded in family values rather than the Protestant work ethic (Biernat, Vescio, & Theno, 1996). Future studies may find that morality plays a more robust role in mediating sexual orientation discrimination when hiring for positions where those values were relevant (e.g., primary school teacher) than the high-status leadership positions we focused on. Third, whilst we aimed to tease apart role congruity and status beliefs theory, the theories are not orthogonal because both bear on competency ratings, and experimentally manipulating status and gender role as orthogonal variables in Study 3 was only partially possible. Research should also extend our findings to other gender stereotypical jobs (see Tilcsik, Anteby, & Knight, 2015). Importantly, future research should consider not only the intersectionality between gender and sexual orientation, but also race and ethnicity. Research has shown that race is gendered and that this affects social categorization and stereotyping (Johnson, Freeman, & Pauker, 2012). With regards to ethnicity, Black gay men are liked more and are seen as better leaders than individuals presented as merely gay or Black (see Remedios, Chasteen, Rule, & Plaks, 2011; Wilson, Remedios, & Rule, 2017; see also Petsko & Bodenhausen, 2019 for effects of ethnicity and sexual orientation intersection on stereotyping). Hence, when the intersection between race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality is considered, different patterns of results could emerge. Finally, we have not considered whether participants who belong to a minority group react differently to cues of sexual orientation. Future research might examine whether sexual minorities and ethnic minorities show similar biases than their majority counterparts.ReferencesAhmed, A. M., Andersson, L., & Hammarstedt, M. (2013).

This aimed to examine whether LG-sounding applicants would be perceived as more suitable and employable for a failing (vs. successful) company as it happens for women. Analyses including this factor did not yield any significant interaction and therefore this factor was not been considered further.2 Only a significant interaction between participant gender, candidate sexual orientation, and type of job occurred on employability ranking, F(1, 119) = 13.65, p < .001, ήp2 = .103. Pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni correction) showed an unexpected pattern of results. Men participants judged the LG-sounding applicants (M = 2.05, SE = .12) as less appointable for masculine type of jobs than heterosexual-sounding applicants (M = 2.94, SE = .12; p < .001), while women rated LG-sounding applicants (M = 2.09, SE = .12) as less appointable for feminine type of jobs than heterosexual-sounding applicants (M = 2.92, SE = .12; p = .002). However, this effect emerged regardless of applicants’ gender. Figure 1. Job suitability across applicants’ gender and sexual orientation in the three studies. Figure 2.

    "abstract": "In three studies (N = 340), we tested whether vocal cues to a person’s sexual orientation prompted sexual orientation discrimination in heterosexual individuals when hiring leaders. Our results inform how gender and sexual orientation intersect to produce discriminatory effects in the hiring context. Heterosexual participants listened to short clips of voices that sounded like job candidate was a lesbian or heterosexual woman, or a gay or heterosexual man, and rated all for job suitability and employability. Candidates applied for jobs as leaders (Study 1), as leaders or assistants (Study 2), and for leadership roles that varied in both gender role and status (Study 3). Sexual orientation discrimination occurred in all three studies and was greater among women job candidates. Refuting role congruity theory, several findings disconfirmed the prediction that lesbian-sounding women would be advantaged when stereotyped as masculine and when applying for leadership roles. Rather, in line with status-beliefs theory, lesbian-sounding women and gay-sounding men were rated and ranked poorly to the extent that they were perceived as less competent than heterosexual candidates. Findings suggest that hiring discrimination occurs in subtle ways, such as when individuals sound gay/lesbian. This has implications for recruitment as well as sexual-orientation discrimination court case",
